[00:12.160 --> 00:19.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.720 --> 00:37.840]  Texas Alex Jones we're live my friends 16th of day of June 2010 on this
[00:37.840 --> 00:43.240]  Wednesday edition I'm Alex Jones your radio talk show host thank you for

[00:47.560 --> 00:53.600]  wonderful courageous a.m. or f.m. local station in your area global shortwave on
[00:53.600 --> 01:01.000]  wwcr the internet at info wars.com or prison planet.com of course xm or on a
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.400]  podcast later or on a YouTube video clip or over at prison planet.tv thank you
[01:08.400 --> 01:16.000]  so much for joining us I'm gonna try to take my time today and pace myself in
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.480]  another attempt to cover all the news and information but I have mainstream
[01:22.480 --> 01:28.960]  media articles today and mainstream news clips where multiple channels are
[01:28.960 --> 01:36.760]  calling for Obama to quote act like a dictator and to quote be a dictator this
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.600]  isn't Woody Allen saying a month ago or other Hollywood people I know this is
[01:41.600 --> 01:50.400]  MSNBC CNN and others and Obama's tone is 18-minute speech from the Oval Office
[01:50.400 --> 01:57.600]  last night said that inaction is not acceptable when BP is his darling one of
[01:57.600 --> 02:04.040]  his biggest campaign contributors behind his alma mater Harvard and of course
[02:04.040 --> 02:11.080]  Goldman Sachs and all of the evidence points towards this increasing every day
[02:11.080 --> 02:18.160]  being a false flag event and so I'm gonna run down the latest developments
[02:18.160 --> 02:24.360]  dealing with the oil spill are we in today 60 something now what day is it I
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.800]  mean I can't even keep track of this anymore so we're gonna be going over
[02:30.800 --> 02:38.120]  that today but bottom line it itself is a distraction kind of like Chandra Levy
[02:38.120 --> 02:44.000]  was in the months before 9-11 you mark my words you can already see it the
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.240]  global controllers are openly saying they're building up with aircraft
[02:47.240 --> 02:54.680]  carriers weapons systems bunker buster missiles and Diego Garcia to attack Iran
[02:54.680 --> 02:59.840]  there is a global realignment in the financial order trillions a week
[02:59.840 --> 03:08.000]  disappearing into private central bank black holes mainstream news is announcing
[03:08.000 --> 03:15.720]  as if it's no big deal just a footnote a side note like a local newspaper
[03:15.720 --> 03:22.840]  reporting the high school football scores from the night before like a
[03:22.840 --> 03:26.360]  Saturday morning paper reporting the football scores in your town the night
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.760]  before that oh yes Obama can shut down the internet with the cyber security
[03:31.760 --> 03:39.240]  act and hackers are about to have a big cyber attack and we've got to start
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.360]  shutting down the web and we've got to of course the mainstream media the
[03:44.360 --> 03:48.840]  control corporate press running around in all directions saying that those that
[03:48.840 --> 03:57.360]  criticize Obama want violence that those who criticize big government are
[03:57.360 --> 04:05.000]  racist and that we're about to attack any minute and that the government needs
[04:05.000 --> 04:15.680]  to be sicked on the American people namely Alex Jones so evil and we do have
[04:15.680 --> 04:25.520]  last night's MSNBC and the night before MSNBC attacking myself Rand Paul and
[04:25.520 --> 04:31.240]  many others and really Pat Buchanan sitting there and taking quite a bit of
[04:31.240 --> 04:39.960]  abuse from Chris Matthews but I guess that's what he's paid to do and Chris
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.840]  Matthews saying look these people are getting ready for violence so that it's
[04:44.840 --> 04:50.640]  clear the system's gonna provocateur and stage violent attacks and further sick
[04:50.640 --> 04:55.880]  the homeland security apparatus on the American people the enemy of the
[04:55.880 --> 05:01.360]  parasitic government
[05:01.600 --> 05:05.480]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[05:05.480 --> 05:10.200]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[05:10.200 --> 05:14.120]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the

[05:18.000 --> 05:22.520]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.840]  system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[05:27.840 --> 05:32.120]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[05:32.120 --> 05:36.280]  legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce
[05:36.280 --> 05:41.680]  pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to
[05:41.680 --> 05:45.520]  follow step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and

[05:51.640 --> 05:58.480]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[05:59.480 --> 06:03.480]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[06:03.480 --> 06:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.840 --> 06:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:16.040 --> 06:19.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.920 --> 06:24.200]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:24.200 --> 06:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.360 --> 06:32.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.680 --> 06:36.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:36.360 --> 06:40.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:40.560 --> 06:43.920]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[06:43.920 --> 06:49.160]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[06:49.160 --> 06:53.800]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[06:53.800 --> 07:00.080]  sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[07:00.080 --> 07:05.760]  attention an important product from hempusa.org micro plant powder will

[08:04.200 --> 08:09.640]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[08:09.640 --> 08:25.560]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:25.560 --> 08:32.520]  there are just countless gyms that illustrate just how fraudulent this
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.600]  global corporate illegitimate government is but one of the biggest is
[08:37.600 --> 08:42.800]  this American who reportedly has gone to Afghanistan and Pakistan and gone into
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.400]  the tribal areas sporting a big Taliban beard looking for Usama bin Laden and
[08:49.400 --> 08:55.080]  handing out Christian literature I'll guarantee you if you meet that guy
[08:55.080 --> 09:02.920]  because I've read the the scoop on him he's a nice guy he changed your tire he
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.920]  be the type of neighbor you want to live next door to who would help you but he's
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.880]  also the kind of person that buys in to government mind control propaganda I mean
[09:13.880 --> 09:19.400]  he is angry as an American and he believes Usama bin Laden really attacked
[09:19.400 --> 09:26.480]  the United States on 9-11 and so in the last eight years he has gone to
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.920]  Afghanistan and Pakistan at least six times and he was finally arrested for
[09:31.920 --> 09:42.160]  it for running around with a handgun and quote Christian literature yeah they'll
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.720]  arrest you for that in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan that's why there are allies
[09:46.720 --> 09:51.920]  Iraq left Christians alone that's why they had to be dealt with seriously they
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.480]  have a Pentagon policy since the 50s of not wanting secular mainline governments
[09:56.480 --> 10:01.400]  in the Middle East because they might actually have movie theaters and rock
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.600]  and roll stations and people that actually have colleges and want to be
[10:05.600 --> 10:10.400]  first world have their own banking system ah ah you want to keep women
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.480]  basically in chains and wear big you know headdresses over their faces the CIA's
[10:16.480 --> 10:25.000]  got billions for you but this well-meaning American he doesn't
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.840]  understand that but but that is the normal response I mean if you really
[10:28.840 --> 10:36.400]  think Al Qaeda Al Ciaida carried out the 9-11 attacks shouldn't you be over in
[10:36.400 --> 10:40.240]  Pakistan and Afghanistan I mean I'll tell you something right now if I would
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.960]  have had family lost in the towers I didn't but if I would have it would have
[10:44.960 --> 10:51.360]  been personal I would have least gone over there as a journalist to illustrate
[10:51.360 --> 10:55.480]  that well if our government says bin Laden's alive why aren't they going
[10:55.480 --> 11:03.160]  into these tribal areas on the Afghan Pakistan frontier why aren't they doing
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.120]  that I mean I would be over there and if I thought I knew where he was I would
[11:07.120 --> 11:13.880]  try to kill him so the media is making fun of this guy no I mean he believes the
[11:13.880 --> 11:19.400]  propaganda so what do you expect out of someone who buys propaganda I mean you
[11:19.400 --> 11:23.560]  know he hates Al Qaeda Al Qaeda attacks on 9-11 he didn't lose any family but he
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.320]  took it personally and so he's been over there at least six times trying to
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.400]  kill someone bin Laden now he should know that some of bin Laden's codename in
[11:33.400 --> 11:38.320]  the CIA this is declassified as Tim Osmond he should know that the BBC and
[11:38.320 --> 11:42.800]  AP as well as Newsweek reported on the quote airlift of evil you just search
[11:42.800 --> 11:51.120]  that term and six to eight thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda cream is the quote
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.800]  from the Times of London cream the leadership was flown out to safety in
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.240]  Pakistan by the CIA and when the military colonels were actually in the
[12:02.240 --> 12:05.160]  San Francisco Chronicle and other papers complaining when they would capture
[12:05.160 --> 12:08.520]  the head of the Taliban their general when they would capture some of bin
[12:08.520 --> 12:11.920]  Laden's number two and number three number four they would be ordered to
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.600]  release them and it was also reported they were given large chest of solid
[12:17.600 --> 12:29.560]  gold bars of gold bars of gold huge chest ammunition cases of bars of gold
[12:29.560 --> 12:41.000]  well done men it was a staged war and I had the former CIA section chief on how
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.200]  do you get them on you sneak up on them they got a publisher he had a new book
[12:46.200 --> 12:54.000]  out jawbreaker what four years ago we're admitted some of the truth we already
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.040]  knew this and so I just called the publisher up had a producer call them
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.840]  up say we're a syndicated shell I can have them on boom in the queue that's
[13:00.840 --> 13:05.160]  how I got Rothschild on that time he had a children's book brainwashing kids
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.440]  teaching him the earth is gonna die they didn't pay Al Gore and him some money
[13:08.440 --> 13:11.440]  and their carbon trading company literally the Rothschild's on the big
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.000]  one in Europe along with Al Gore being a shareholder that in the Chicago
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.440]  mercantile with with Obama Osama Obama he's another CIA guy there's a lot in
[13:23.440 --> 13:30.320]  common with bin Laden and all the Taliban al-Qaeda did was grab tens of
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.640]  thousands average age 14 young goat herders literally off the mountain and
[13:35.640 --> 13:41.960]  hilltops and stuck them in the two or three major cities of Afghanistan and
[13:41.960 --> 13:47.720]  then and the media reported yes they put one ring out about a mile in front of
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.160]  each town and then another ring about a half mile or out in front of the town
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.480]  and then the Taliban al-Qaeda leaders they sit in the cities and the people
[13:59.480 --> 14:05.280]  out in the first ring are complete conscripts they've been pressed into
[14:05.280 --> 14:12.200]  service they've been kidnapped forced by the Taliban slash al-Qaeda slash CIA
[14:12.200 --> 14:18.080]  press games and they've been put into service and it was actually on the news
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.720]  the Northern Alliance was complaining because you know being the opium running
[14:21.720 --> 14:28.560]  dukes of the north they weren't given all the the departmentalized info they
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.240]  were complaining why can't we shell the second level emplacements and the
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.440]  government building emplacements where the actual Taliban al-Qaeda leadership
[14:37.440 --> 14:45.400]  are why are we forced to only shell and attack the front lines those are
[14:45.400 --> 14:55.280]  innocent people stuck in trenches to die because it wasn't a real war ladies and
[14:55.280 --> 14:59.440]  gentlemen and even the author of Jobbreaker I forget his name
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.920]  like wallet guys we got Google the CIA section chief jobbreaker is book
[15:04.920 --> 15:10.640]  jobbreaker and it's got the guy's name I can't remember four years ago and he
[15:10.640 --> 15:14.280]  admitted that almost everyone at the different camps in Afghanistan and
[15:14.280 --> 15:22.360]  black sites in Poland Romania Albania Czech Republic Germany and the Middle
[15:22.360 --> 15:36.560]  East of course Jordan Saudi Arabia Egypt that almost all of them were
[15:36.560 --> 15:44.360]  completely innocent teenagers were average age 14 well you get these CIA
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.360]  guys on they can't believe when you've done your homework and I brought it up
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.920]  to him and I said well I have all these articles here before your book you know
[15:49.920 --> 15:53.280]  because he was all backing up his book saying and he's got all this proof and
[15:53.280 --> 15:57.840]  I said well sir it's already in the news at the time it was hidden in plain view
[15:57.840 --> 16:01.400]  that these were totally innocent people and then it's all a laboratory all the
[16:01.400 --> 16:05.280]  drill all the simulation to train battle-hardened ribs for other areas of
[16:05.280 --> 16:10.320]  the world and domestically and that and that the average bribe was over $20,000
[16:10.320 --> 16:18.040]  given to Taliban al-Qaeda to grab innocent teenagers some as young as 11
[16:18.040 --> 16:24.760]  and to take them and torture them just so the media can be told look we have
[16:24.760 --> 16:38.240]  camps full of these people yeah it was jawbreaker Gary Bern Bernson that was his
[16:38.240 --> 16:46.840]  name so all of that is going on see I've digressed here and that's my
[16:46.840 --> 16:53.520]  frustration here on the transmission is that to just talk about this American
[16:53.520 --> 17:02.000]  who's a patriot who goes to Afghanistan and Pakistan and risk his life at least
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.600]  six times going into some of the most dangerous areas in the world hunting to
[17:06.600 --> 17:12.200]  kill bin Laden to even get into that story to even talk about it I do you a
[17:12.200 --> 17:16.440]  disservice unless I go into some background and the background I just
[17:16.440 --> 17:26.280]  gave you is nothing it was the same story in Iraq 2003 it was even in the
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.280]  press conferences before when Rumsfeld said don't worry we've already paid off
[17:31.280 --> 17:38.040]  most of the Iraqi Republican Guard generals and we've paid off the other
[17:38.040 --> 17:42.480]  regular Army generals and their armies are gonna stand down then after they had
[17:42.480 --> 17:46.800]  the big victory of the takeover Rumsfeld came out and said I never said
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.160]  that just that's how dumb they think we are that's the contempt they have for
[17:51.160 --> 18:00.360]  us so sometimes our special forces would actually go into the cities and would
[18:00.360 --> 18:03.680]  capture Taliban al-Qaeda leaders and they would tell them take me to your
[18:03.680 --> 18:08.040]  leader call the CIA I am be released and the military would throw fits about it
[18:08.040 --> 18:10.960]  and would pay them the goal they were ordered to give them and loaded them on
[18:10.960 --> 18:16.160]  C-130s and ferried six to eight thousand some estimates are ten thousand out to
[18:16.160 --> 18:24.160]  Pakistan and then they could be used according to the Chicago Tribune and
[18:24.160 --> 18:32.760]  AP earlier this year it was declassified to lead a staged attack in India
[18:32.760 --> 18:38.320]  remember that a year and a half ago the Mumbai massacre of course we had
[18:38.320 --> 18:45.320]  guest on at the time to break down the fact that it was US and Israeli and
[18:45.320 --> 18:50.560]  British forces and then it came out that the leader of the entire operation was
[18:50.560 --> 18:58.560]  US CIA on record on record that was the headline US agent led attack and the
[18:58.560 --> 19:03.560]  guys they found only one of them alive were on so many hallucinogenic drugs I
[19:03.560 --> 19:07.120]  mean the few videos they showed those guys were whacked out of their brains
[19:07.120 --> 19:10.720]  of course you have special forces bombs and people shoot some people then you
[19:10.720 --> 19:17.040]  just release four or five guys who are on enough liquid LSD and PCP and speed
[19:17.040 --> 19:21.160]  they were on just everything masculine they had everything in their blood so
[19:21.160 --> 19:25.120]  whacked out those guys were seeing purple rainbow elephants jumping around and
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.400]  and they give them automatic weapons they didn't even have beards ladies and
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.040]  gentlemen not even must they mean they weren't even Muslims they just release
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.480]  them hallucinating and have some special forces kill them meanwhile in the

[24:29.520 --> 24:35.760]  Neurostand province Pakistani police announced yesterday he was carrying a
[24:35.760 --> 24:41.240]  pistol a sword night vision equipment and Christian religious books said Moutaz
[24:41.240 --> 24:47.200]  Ahmed a police chief in the area he told police he was there to find and kill a
[24:47.200 --> 24:53.960]  summer bin Laden but I'm gonna move on into the news what I'm gonna do is I'm
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.680]  just gonna cover four or five stacks just trying to go over the headlines with
[24:59.680 --> 25:07.440]  brief comments that I'm gonna go back into what's happening with Barry
[25:07.440 --> 25:16.440]  Sataro aka Barry Obama and Michelle Sataro Obama and doing exactly what we
[25:16.440 --> 25:21.760]  said they would do not letting a good crisis go to waste he did propose the
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.720]  carbon tax again he praised the house legislation that's passed and said it
[25:26.720 --> 25:33.760]  was needed in the Senate and what he's also said he's gonna do is use the EPA
[25:33.760 --> 25:38.680]  to implement the carbon taxes
[25:42.160 --> 25:48.880]  through the bureaucracy without the Congress even taking action and so the
[25:48.880 --> 25:55.760]  message is we're gonna put taxes on coal that supplies 51% of the country's
[25:55.760 --> 26:02.800]  energy conservatively that will fix any oil spells meanwhile you have BP a
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.960]  founding member of the carbon tax lobby I mean you've heard me for years in my
[26:08.960 --> 26:22.080]  films actually in in game I talk about BP made three and a half years ago get
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.680]  into the fact that BP is a kingpin British petroleum we cover British
[26:26.680 --> 26:31.840]  petroleum in for the Republican Obama deception I mean we're not just blaming
[26:31.840 --> 26:37.000]  them as being top-level as now any of you've been in an airport or open to
[26:37.000 --> 26:42.160]  magazine up it's almost always BP pushing carbon taxes BP pushing New
[26:42.160 --> 26:48.320]  World Order BP pushing world government and I tell you they stage this the
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.900]  evidence is overwhelming bare minimum they block the response by the
[26:53.900 --> 26:57.840]  Norwegians in the Dutch and wouldn't get rid of the Jones Act that doesn't
[26:57.840 --> 27:01.560]  allow foreign ships in if they weren't built in the US to go from port to port
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.960]  or to be in our waters engaged in any type of domestic shipping operation they
[27:06.960 --> 27:15.280]  can haul globalist goods in but they can't be involved in I guess dredging
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.320]  operations or things like that and this is considered to be dredging which is
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.720]  asinine but
[27:27.280 --> 27:30.920]  but to go back to what I was talking about with American arrested searching
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.320]  for some bin Laden what do you expect an American to do if you really believe
[27:34.320 --> 27:37.560]  bin Laden carried these attacks out and eight and a half years later after the
[27:37.560 --> 27:49.760]  attacks all these years later eight plus years in Afghanistan and I remember
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.120]  Bush as saying halfway into his administration four years and he said
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.840]  I don't care where bin Laden is I'm not looking for bin Laden I'm not concerned
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.800]  about bin Laden I don't you know really ever think about him we're supposed to
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.560]  invade all these countries now they say he's in Iran so we've got to invade
[28:06.560 --> 28:13.440]  Iran I mean if they want to invade your backyard are they gonna put up a scarecrow
[28:13.440 --> 28:19.680]  of bin Laden you know maybe imminent domain they want to take your farm for a
[28:19.680 --> 28:24.560]  highway or take your business or maybe a local cop once your wife he'll just come
[28:24.560 --> 28:29.200]  put a cutout kind of like they have cutouts at John Wayne or Marilyn Monroe
[28:29.200 --> 28:36.560]  that you see at the mall you can buy paper cutouts just put a paper cutout
[28:36.560 --> 28:40.600]  in your backyard and show up and say hey I'm taking your property who some of
[28:40.600 --> 28:46.080]  bin Laden's in your backyard I mean that's how stupid this is and so to be
[28:46.080 --> 28:50.800]  absolutely clear our criminal government made a deal with the Taliban on
[28:50.800 --> 28:58.440]  al-Qaeda who they set up in the 1980s to fight the Russians who they were in
[28:58.440 --> 29:04.440]  constant contact with they made a deal with them to just have a stage war put
[29:04.440 --> 29:12.760]  some conscripts in the front lines let the West bomb them let NATO bomb them
[29:12.760 --> 29:18.640]  let the US bomb them let the Northern Alliance bomb them and there was some
[29:18.640 --> 29:21.440]  men fighting in some of the Taliban groups there were some real religious
[29:21.440 --> 29:25.160]  groups over the call themselves Taliban who were not allowing any opium to be
[29:25.160 --> 29:30.400]  produced of course the old CIA Taliban didn't like that and so they came in had
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.120]  a staged war same thing with Iraq in 2003 on record paid off the major
[29:35.120 --> 29:40.760]  military to stand down then once the US got in they would stage many of their
[29:40.760 --> 29:45.400]  own IED attacks on our own forces and attack the Shiites and Sunnis to get
[29:45.400 --> 29:51.640]  them fighting with each other as a pretext to stay I'll be right back we're

[33:37.800 --> 33:44.360]  dancing to the tune of the Pied Piper of Western intelligence or they're being
[33:44.360 --> 33:49.880]  funded to carry out attacks through their chain of command by the very great
[33:49.880 --> 33:57.800]  Satan they claim they're fighting and nowhere is this better illustrated in
[33:57.800 --> 34:02.000]  the fact that the Taliban al-Qaeda were flown out the safety in the months
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.840]  during the quote invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001 early 2002 and
[34:07.840 --> 34:11.000]  that's all on record
[34:11.000 --> 34:21.520]  and it's also on record that in the months before 9 11 the BBC and other
[34:21.520 --> 34:30.240]  British news organizations reported that US special forces were seen on the
[34:30.240 --> 34:35.720]  border region of Pakistan and Afghanistan in a small town naming it
[34:35.720 --> 34:41.040]  guarding Osama bin Laden and that a month before that LeFigaro and other big
[34:41.040 --> 34:46.200]  papers in France reported he was at the American hospital in Dubai getting
[34:46.200 --> 34:54.440]  dialysis and then Bandar Bush the big buddy of the Bush family the ambassador
[34:54.440 --> 34:59.040]  to the United States from Saudi Arabia on Larry King live one week after the
[34:59.040 --> 35:05.840]  attacks you can pull this video up on YouTube and Larry King live was calling
[35:05.840 --> 35:11.440]  the host of it Larry King was calling bin Laden a coward and Bandar said how dare
[35:11.440 --> 35:15.760]  you call him a coward he's not a coward he is a comes from a great family and is
[35:15.760 --> 35:22.080]  a great man because they knew that CNN was aired in Saudi Arabia and the
[35:22.080 --> 35:26.240]  families like look our son CIA he'll play the bad guy for you he'll be a big
[35:26.240 --> 35:33.640]  hero here in the Muslim 80% Sunni country

[35:40.360 --> 35:45.320]  for you and Bandar said you do not talk about him that way in front of you
[35:45.320 --> 35:51.080]  that's how dumb they think you are they won't even talk bad about Osama bin
[35:51.080 --> 35:59.840]  Laden in front of Bandar Bush that's his nickname Prince Bandar of Saad Bandar

[38:49.760 --> 39:03.200]  after hour after hour on one subject here's a headline from prisonplanet.com
[39:03.200 --> 39:12.240]  new bill gives Osama kill switch to shut down the internet I say Osama I'm
[39:12.240 --> 39:19.960]  sorry new bill gives Obama kill switch to shut down the internet that was an
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.360]  actual Freudian slip I didn't do that on purpose I I see them both as CIA
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.760]  officers I mean that's who they are new bill gives Obama kill switch to shut
[39:29.760 --> 39:35.720]  down the internet you know it's come out that Bill Gates the CIA it's come out
[39:35.720 --> 39:46.160]  that the last two British prime ministers is MI6 Tony Blair and Gordon
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.440]  Brown you don't think they leave actual elections up to you little people oh they
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.480]  select and hype and give attention to who they want and then some of you go
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.280]  down and vote for them and oh you sure showed Bill Clinton with George W. Bush
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.520]  and oh then you sure showed George W. with Obama and you're sure gonna
[40:05.520 --> 40:10.440]  show him with Mitt Romney or whoever else you oh you're sure show them won't
[40:10.440 --> 40:17.040]  you yes you'll you'll show the bankers but see they're scared because we're
[40:17.040 --> 40:24.480]  actually showing the people that control paradigm and they're operatives like
[40:24.480 --> 40:36.320]  Chris Matthews don't like it new bill gives Obama kill switch to shut down
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.120]  the internet there's another one steel accuses Obama of exploiting oil spill
[40:40.120 --> 40:47.240]  for a political game that's like accusing a grizzly bear of killing
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.680]  caribou that's like accusing water of being wet steel accuses Obama of
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.440]  exploiting oil spill for political gain really you think so Psycho talk MSNBC
[40:58.440 --> 41:04.440]  Schultz calls for Obama to act like a dictator
[41:11.200 --> 41:19.080]  congressman Boehner says Obama exploiting crisis to push jobs killing
[41:19.080 --> 41:32.880]  energy tax and it continues
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.480]  senator mcconnell to be replaced by Rand Paul of all goes well says Obama
[41:39.480 --> 41:53.200]  concerned with taxing Americans not plugging the leak no kidding but let me
[41:53.200 --> 42:00.360]  go over some other news before I run out of time here and then I will go over the
[42:00.360 --> 42:05.800]  different angles of the oil spill and where I see that going then I'm gonna
[42:05.800 --> 42:10.480]  get into the MSNBC hit piece set to air tonight and it's really much to do about
[42:10.480 --> 42:15.920]  nothing they've been hyping it for three weeks solid on every show every hour
[42:15.920 --> 42:22.840]  every day so instead of having 500,000 viewers like Chris slimeball Matthews
[42:22.840 --> 42:27.520]  normally does I mean that's a joke in cable news he'll probably have 2 million
[42:27.520 --> 42:33.000]  tonight and they're gonna air it you normally has one or two of these
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.480]  documentaries a year I looked up some numbers on his last documentary when
[42:37.480 --> 42:41.440]  Ted Kennedy died they'd already produced it before he died because they
[42:41.440 --> 42:48.120]  everybody knew that was coming and that was aired more than 20 times so this
[42:48.120 --> 42:52.160]  will probably air more than 20 times and so it'll probably be seen I don't know
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.240]  15 20 million times I mean who knows first time it'll be seen by 2 million
[42:57.240 --> 43:01.600]  next time a million and they'll air it over and over again so basically the
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.280]  only way they can get people to see particularly important propaganda is to
[43:05.280 --> 43:11.200]  air it over and over and over again like a Kevin Frodo infomercial hoping that
[43:11.200 --> 43:15.520]  anyone surfing the cable dial the hundreds of millions globally that do
[43:15.520 --> 43:23.240]  get the cable packages that have MSNBC the Bill Gates propaganda channel
[43:23.240 --> 43:30.720]  Bill Gates slash general electric bomb making fake liberal channel I will be
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.600]  going over that because it is dangerous program we have the script and now
[43:35.600 --> 43:38.640]  he's foreshadowed it to the last two nights and it appears that that is a
[43:38.640 --> 43:42.600]  script that they did go with the script we got from inside sources that are
[43:42.600 --> 43:48.640]  concerned inside MSNBC just like law enforcement leaks us the Mayak and
[43:48.640 --> 43:53.360]  Homeland Security report just like we've been leaked the clergy response team
[43:53.360 --> 44:00.440]  reports and so many others they are saying that basically I'm calling for
[44:00.440 --> 44:04.320]  violence and I'm dangerous that's the government line that I'm calling for
[44:04.320 --> 44:07.640]  cop killing and overthrow the government because I say the government's
[44:07.640 --> 44:12.400]  illegitimate now you guys want to make it violent because you're losing the
[44:12.400 --> 44:15.640]  fight in the info war so you want to make it about violence I'm gonna break
[44:15.640 --> 44:19.400]  that down coming up in the next hour and later in the next hour I will open
[44:19.400 --> 44:26.160]  the phones up they're not open yet for first-time callers first-time callers
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.680]  who want to comment on the whole oil spill situation the puppet distraction
[44:31.680 --> 44:42.720]  Barry Sotaro aka Barack Hussein Obama but WikiLeaks founder has massacre video
[44:42.720 --> 44:51.400]  of course we reported on this a month ago when they released the helicopter
[44:51.400 --> 44:56.680]  massacre video from Baghdad that he has hundreds of other videos and documents
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.920]  we have connections into WikiLeaks I'll just leave it at that and we were just
[44:59.920 --> 45:06.160]  told it is massacre videos from Afghanistan and that it shows basically
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.760]  people giggling and laughing over the satellite connections from their bases
[45:10.760 --> 45:17.920]  in Virginia and in Arizona Nevada and other areas New Mexico piloting these as
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.840]  they to kill one person kill 140 plus men women and children to supposedly get
[45:22.840 --> 45:27.160]  one person and now they admit in the last month that oh we kill no-name
[45:27.160 --> 45:32.840]  people if we see you in Pakistan or Afghanistan with a gun and it's kind of
[45:32.840 --> 45:37.640]  like Texas everybody's got a gun you die we don't know your name you got a
[45:37.640 --> 45:42.280]  turbine on you're walking well that's what they wear there from the sun you
[45:42.280 --> 45:49.400]  got a gun you die very very simple it's like something like Terminator 4 where
[45:49.400 --> 45:57.600]  Skylab is up there and you know humans outside you die it's just part of the
[45:57.600 --> 46:01.240]  freedom by the way the AP did report Friday that they are gonna dispatch
[46:01.240 --> 46:08.280]  predator drones and then weaponize them in US cities so you run from the cops
[46:08.280 --> 46:16.720]  now how about a hellfire up your six wiki leaks founder has massacre video oh
[46:16.720 --> 46:20.400]  you made fun of us a year ago when we reported that they are training with
[46:20.400 --> 46:25.920]  Homeland Security to use predator drones the American people remember seven
[46:25.920 --> 46:29.400]  years ago they had a Fox news piece about hover drones that look like flying
[46:29.400 --> 46:34.440]  saucers but they have a fan in them it's a hovercraft that has face scanning
[46:34.440 --> 46:39.960]  cameras just like the license plate reads you now on most toll roads no no
[46:39.960 --> 46:43.520]  track or chip needed now just like we told you now it's happening again we
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.160]  just read the government documents that it'll fly up and face scan you and it's
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.120]  gonna have lethal and less lethal it's gonna have microwave cannon sound cannon
[46:52.120 --> 46:57.160]  and missiles and shotgun and so just a hover drone kills you it's all your tax
[46:57.160 --> 47:04.400]  money yes the balance of power is gone the founder said we needed guns for the
[47:04.400 --> 47:07.880]  balance of power against the central government well no they're now going to
[47:07.880 --> 47:12.920]  be mounted with nerve gas for you and your family you think the government's
[47:12.920 --> 47:17.200]  arrogant now sucking trillions a month out of you globally trillions a week oh
[47:17.200 --> 47:22.360]  no they've just gotten started wiki leaks founder has massacre video and I
[47:22.360 --> 47:26.840]  was driving home yesterday I took the family fishing for a few days a little
[47:26.840 --> 47:34.120]  time off was good to take some time off be more reflective get my bearings
[47:34.120 --> 47:45.200]  my moorings a little more tightly dialed in and I heard Fox News on my XM
[47:45.200 --> 47:49.720]  announcing that basically the founder Ricky leaks is some type of terrorist
[47:49.720 --> 47:56.080]  and he's being hunted by the Pentagon yes he's a runner and they've arrested
[47:56.080 --> 48:06.000]  the officer who released all these videos of course Daniel Ellsberg of the
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.960]  Pentagon Papers admittedly he was on MSNBC last week and said that there was a
[48:09.960 --> 48:15.840]  hit team dispatched to kill him at the time or incapacitate him and that a hit
[48:15.840 --> 48:20.400]  teams out for the founder of wiki leaks she's got all these videos and see you're
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.240]  not meant to see them shooting little kids in a van and then laughing about it
[48:25.240 --> 48:30.480]  you're not meant to see whole families killed because this is all planned for
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.040]  you and it's meant to be disconnected you're not meant to see that wiki leaks
[48:36.040 --> 48:41.160]  founder has massacre video this is up on prison planet comm info wars.com after
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.600]  several days underground the founder of the secretive website wiki leaks has
[48:46.600 --> 48:50.360]  gone public to disclose that he is preparing to release a classified
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.120]  Pentagon video of a US airstrike in Afghanistan last year that has left us
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.560]  many as 140 civilians dead most of them children and teenagers and an email
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.520]  obtained by the Daily Beast that was sent to wiki leaks supporters in the
[49:03.520 --> 49:10.040]  United States Tuesday Julian Assange the web sites Australian born founder also
[49:10.040 --> 49:13.760]  defends a 22 year old army intelligence specialist who's now under arrest
[49:13.760 --> 49:21.200]  in Kuwait on charges that he leaked classified combat videos as well as 260
[49:21.200 --> 49:27.640]  thousand state department cables to wiki leaks American officials said they are
[49:27.640 --> 49:31.760]  eager to determine the whereabouts of Assange who canceled an appearance last
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.240]  Friday in Vegas to discourage him from releasing any more classified information
[49:36.240 --> 49:40.680]  his website which is normally based in Sweden and promotes itself as a global
[49:40.680 --> 49:44.960]  resource for whistleblowers as recently as two weeks ago Assange who first gained
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.080]  global notoriety as a computer hacker was in his native Australia in April his
[49:50.080 --> 49:54.520]  website posted a copy of a classified Pentagon video of a 2007 American
[49:54.520 --> 49:57.920]  helicopter attack and Baghdad in which a dozen people were killed including
[49:57.920 --> 50:03.920]  Reuters reporters and see the message is you don't release homeland security
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.440]  reports saying that homeland security is really for gun owners veterans
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.240]  conservatives libertarians because those are you know while there's still cops
[50:16.240 --> 50:19.560]  and military we've got a sick among the American people it's only after we're
[50:19.560 --> 50:27.960]  done using them that they're the enemy of course when we get law enforcement
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.880]  documents we confirm they're real and then we erase the person's phone number
[50:31.880 --> 50:38.080]  and their email oh we erase it we don't even want it and of course the cops and
[50:38.080 --> 50:44.000]  people that send us material they there's an understanding that they're not
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.360]  going to talk either the problem is with this army intelligence officer is he did

[54:11.720 --> 54:18.000]  charlie wilson's war about the congressman it's a total fabrication
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.960]  it's absolute lie of course it's been declassified two years ago as a big
[54:24.960 --> 54:31.400]  number zensky also published a book the same year bragging that in 1979 the CIA
[54:31.400 --> 54:38.120]  created the mujahideen and all kind of and had them start attacking the
[54:38.120 --> 54:50.120]  bordering nations north of Afghanistan the belly of the USSR and then the
[54:50.120 --> 54:54.320]  Russians responded and came in and they were tyrants as well people always
[54:54.320 --> 54:57.920]  think of this side's good and that side's bad no how about both sides are
[54:57.920 --> 55:01.960]  completely evil because both sides say well we've got to be more evil than the
[55:01.960 --> 55:05.360]  other side we've got a we've got to engage in every dirty trick out there to
[55:05.360 --> 55:10.240]  beat the evil for the greater good and then you've compromised and it's all
[55:10.240 --> 55:22.840]  over that's how the road to hell is paved is compromise and the reason I
[55:22.840 --> 55:31.440]  digress off into that is no it doesn't even matter I was just going to go off
[55:31.440 --> 55:37.600]  into a whole story about charlie wilson's war and how in the movie with
[55:37.600 --> 55:43.920]  tom hanks they show him by the mid 80s funding it and that he was the guy
[55:43.920 --> 55:57.120]  behind it just total baloney total fraud and that the CIA didn't want to be
[55:57.120 --> 56:01.920]  involved and had to be shown by one little group of analysts it's just all
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.120]  lies on record it's all lies I mean brazinski's written all book about
[56:06.120 --> 56:15.800]  bragging about how they started the war with the Soviets but the reason I bring
[56:15.800 --> 56:20.880]  that up is in the film it shows the Russians coming in with their hind
[56:20.880 --> 56:28.480]  helicopters and their floggers and their other armored helicopters and just
[56:28.480 --> 56:34.760]  blasting whole villages of people and killing whole groups of children and
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.360]  chasing men women and children down murdering them indiscriminately and
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.400]  I'll never forget the Ithaca Journal about a year into the war that was
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.360]  interviewing members of the troops one of them was even named Gruckheimer
[56:48.360 --> 56:52.160]  remember it became a national issue and they said yeah we go into villages and
[56:52.160 --> 56:55.880]  we line the men women and children up and we kill every one of them and I don't
[56:55.880 --> 57:00.160]  like killing babies but we have to so we even kill babies and the Pentagon came
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.840]  out on Fox News and said well to be clear we only kill the babies in certain
[57:03.840 --> 57:10.520]  villages that was their clarification and so you watch that movie about Charlie
[57:10.520 --> 57:14.800]  Wilson's war and oh the Russians of the bad guys they fly in and bomb weddings
[57:14.800 --> 57:20.400]  and then meanwhile it's admitted that the CIA particularly likes to target
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.120]  weddings to kill a whole bunch of high-value targets at one time and they

[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.600]  i'm ashamed of the job i've done
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.080]  because i never intended
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.920]  to be this successful i just was angry about

[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.640]  uh... because
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.320]  i talk about how the globalist want a world government to carry out an orderly
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.000]  population reduction
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.680]  all i'm reading a state department of randoms all i'm reading is the nineteen
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:40.320]  ninety six u n biological diversity assessment all i'm reading is the times
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.560]  of london with the headline ultra rich meet
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.720]  in secret discuss overpopulation
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.600]  i mean we actually in this office read erin dikes and i
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.640]  the hundreds and hundreds of pages
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.120]  of the seventy six new vaccines
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.640]  being funded by the bellarmine the gates foundation
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640]  and upwards of half of them
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:09.640]  are for covert sterilization
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:15.560]  now let me be clear about you know the point of saying i'm ashamed of the job
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:19.720]  i've done
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:23.120]  i'm proud of the fact i've had a pure heart
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.960]  i'm proud of the fact that
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:32.360]  i've been like a bulldog and never let go
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:35.320]  i'm proud of the fact that my heart's been the right place but
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.640]  i can't help
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.560]  but look at
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.600]  all the opportunities i've had
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:45.240]  and the squandered opportunities to wake people up and the mistakes i've made
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:46.120]  and
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.720]  but then i understand that historically nobody's perfect
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:55.600]  none of us have all of the answers
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.800]  and then i've done the best i could
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.600]  and then i'm trying right now
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.840]  to really go to the next level to grow up
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:11.000]  and to be more focused and more serious and to really get in depth
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.760]  into every subject i cover
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.640]  instead of just grazing over the surface because
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.720]  i can't just make a pronouncement
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.680]  even if i've documented it a thousand times in the past
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:28.480]  on every tv show on every radio show in every article we write in everything we
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.000]  do in every film i make
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.380]  i can't just
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.040]  condense the info
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.000]  and make a claim
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.440]  without going back and pointing to all the proof we've put on
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:41.280]  because this information is so incredible
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:44.320]  people are going to have trouble believing it
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.720]  if we're able to show them the proof each time
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.600]  then no matter how outrageous it is
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:55.680]  it can be something that supercharges their awakening
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.200]  i know it's crazy that every top globalist openly writes books and make
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.520]  statements about forcibly sterilizing us
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:04.200]  covertly sterilizing us
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.920]  and bringing in an authoritarian world government
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.760]  to establish neo-futilism
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.800]  but that's what peter singer and dr peonka
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.680]  and and and holdren
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.520]  and
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.920]  paul urlick i mean that's all
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:30.480]  there's more of them than you can shake a stick at
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.080]  any direction you look once you understand this is going on it's all
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.320]  they talk about
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.160]  it's all they do
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.200]  the guys printed a bunch of news for me today that was on the websites that i
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.480]  hadn't even read
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.360]  setting it back to last night
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.640]  and there's got to be four five mainstream news articles about how great
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.520]  it is not have any children
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.200]  first it's only have one now it's don't have any
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.000]  and should there be taxes on having more than one kid and
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.480]  oh billa melinda gates you know i've gotten two hundred billion dollars for more
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.920]  themselves and others now they want four hundred billion others
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:06.440]  they want tax breaks for the elite to give their money to eugenics that's
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.240]  mainstream news today
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.320]  folks this is real
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:19.400]  and chris matthews writes a big hit piece msnbc and cover up of
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:24.760]  manifestly provable population control plan
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.200]  and msnbc the last two nights
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.600]  they've attacked me on multiple shows
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.160]  i found out
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.400]  chris matthews has been hitting me not after night so other shows in msnbc
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:41.480]  and and and on every show they say i'm going to cause violence
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:45.160]  i'm calling for violence i'm stirring up violence
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.880]  and that's in the script we got
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.800]  uh... that one of their people lead us because they're concerned
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.520]  uh... for the television program rise the right that's going to air tonight
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.520]  and i'm the finale of the program
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.280]  on the king of the crazies
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:04.280]  uh... in their words
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.400]  and they just said that i'm completely insane
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.920]  and there's no plan
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:16.960]  to reduce world population
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.040]  pat you can was on the panel
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.920]  i'm not attacking pat here
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.160]  but the issue is
[01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.960]  he was in the nixon white house
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:29.480]  and i've seen his name in papers concerning force population reduction
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:30.520]  that nixon
[01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.560]  and kissinger
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.560]  and george herbert walker bush were obsessed with
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.120]  pat you can and have actually written about this in the past
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.840]  and he wrote about this in death of the west and he knows fully about it
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.120]  and he sat there and kept his mouth shut
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.280]  during this
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.080]  he was in the white house at that a high level
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:53.040]  when state department random two hundred was secretly published
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.000]  and circulated the cia
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.120]  out of the orders of richard millhouse nexon
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.680]  and when george herbert walker was sent to china
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.360]  to sign the secret treaty for a one-child policy and that china would
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.880]  be given hundreds of billions
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.240]  uh... in
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.040]  tax incentives in the u s
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.560]  that is u s companies would be in the aggregate
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.120]  uh... and uh... lowered
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.040]  tariffs
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.040]  in the aggregate that would be just tens of trillions
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.840]  to move industry there
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.680]  if they would have a one-child policy and be a model for world government
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.120]  in the secret alliance
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.760]  between china the united states
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.040]  that's now been declassified
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.440]  or the two countries actually looked at nuking
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:43.000]  rusher together
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.160]  and of course it's now been declassified as the headlines have been everywhere
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:49.000]  that mccarthy was right
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.280]  the pentagon ran the soviet union basically
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.520]  uh... except for a short time on stalin broke away and kick trotsky out
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.760]  uh... then he came over here in front of the neocons that's on record
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.960]  and that they put them in power and that
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.920]  now satan was put in power by the cia in forty nine
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:11.120]  i mean that is all declassified now think of how monstrous and evil our
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:17.400]  government is
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.720]  now you got too many chinese you'll never be stable
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.680]  if you kill
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.960]  tens of millions of them and if you set up a one-child policy
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.800]  the money's gonna flow
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.760]  this is in forty nine
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.920]  and that's why the cfr says the chinese century
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.000]  uh... and and and how america's done
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.440]  because china is the model
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.400]  but i digress
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.120]  look i don't care if chris matthews demonizes me
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.960]  i don't care chris matthews

[01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:18.760]  what i was trying to say in so many words last segment is
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.760]  i am humbled
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:32.360]  by the incredible attention this broadcast has given worldwide
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:38.200]  and i am doing my very best to be a hundred percent accurate
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:43.160]  and to be as informative as i can be here each and every day i
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:49.640]  i want you to know that and i understand more and more the responsibility i have
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:53.240]  and i also want to ask listeners for your support
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.280]  whether it be by spreading the word about the broadcast
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:02.760]  uh or uh defending us uh when people lie about us
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:08.440]  uh financially supporting us by buying the books and videos
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:13.000]  because i realize that i'm committed to this 110 percent
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.680]  there's no going back i passed the point no return
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.640]  more than a decade ago but all of us have passed the point of return
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:25.080]  this new world order comes to kill steal and destroy
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:31.400]  it is tyranny incarnate it is evil and it's very essence
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.760]  it is set itself against everything good
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.520]  and transparent and wholesome and enlightened
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.400]  this global system competes with itself
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:50.360]  to be more wicked and more oppressive and i've always told people don't defend
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:56.280]  me when the mainstream media attacks uh move on
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:01.880]  stay on target stay on issues like the north american union globalization
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:07.240]  inflation tax illegal wars torture federalization of police
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:12.520]  stage terror genetically engineered food population reduction the danger of
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:16.760]  vaccines but more and more i realize
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.320]  that it's important to stay on target to continue to get issues out
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:25.400]  but that what i didn't want to happen has happened
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.560]  i never wanted this to be about alex jones
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.360]  i wanted it to be about the information
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:40.600]  and it is about the information but people love tribal leaders they love
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:45.640]  characters they love the hero archetype and
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:50.280]  so much of my message now which is just the reality of what's happening in the
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:56.040]  world is now bound up in my identity bound up in
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.160]  my name bound up in the symbol of what i am
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.880]  and how people perceive me
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.840]  and i like to screw around i like to play the part of characters and joke and
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.960]  have some fun i like to be lazy intellectually and get
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.920]  angry and yell and scream and that's certainly entertaining
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:23.480]  and part of what built this radio show but none of it was intentional
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:33.800]  and now i'm just trying to gauge the true success we've had in affecting
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.680]  the way that hundreds of millions of people see the world
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:42.920]  unlocking their minds taking the blinders off their eyes
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:49.400]  and now i am being directly targeted by the system and as gandhi said first
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.600]  they ignore you then they laugh at you then they
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:57.720]  attack you then you win but many people don't make it to the
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:28:03.400]  final process the idea makes it to the winning
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.840]  but many times the leader doesn't make it out
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:11.400]  in fact most of the time of the then they attack you face
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.600]  and to have chris mathews the southern property law center
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:20.280]  the adl the new york times time magazine newsweek the london guardian
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:26.120]  salon hundreds of other publications lying about me and saying that i'm
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.200]  basically calling for violence and that i want people to kill cops
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:35.800]  do you know why that's being done that is being done
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.480]  so when they kill me deader than a hammer
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.480]  it can be sold as well he deserved it he was messing with our precious
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.760]  protectors or when they stage a terror attack
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:52.440]  so it can be blamed on yours truly i've now entered that zone
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.200]  of intensifying danger and the funny thing is i'm not
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.440]  concerned about that in the least in fact it's invigorating
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:04.600]  and not an emotional level not at a adrenaline level
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:08.920]  but at a spiritual level it is extremely
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:16.760]  purifying satisfying deep down to know that i set out to fight
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.600]  corruption i set out to fight the scientific dictatorship
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:28.280]  i am disgusted at every level by tyranny and now i have the attentions
[01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:36.760]  of the dragon which means i have irritated the dragon
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.800]  which means the dragon is not invincible and if i've had this much success
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.480]  with all of my problems think of the success you can have
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:48.840]  so don't get caught up in thinking you've got to do a perfect job
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:55.560]  just engage the evil we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.960]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.040]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.800]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.640]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:23.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:27.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.560]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:34.760]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.680]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.480]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:44.440]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.320]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.200]  and again i talk about myself sometimes in relation to the new world order
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.440]  because that's how we all relate to the world is
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.440]  as individuals because i know the journey i've gone through is similar to
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.400]  the journey many of you have experienced you've
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:36.280]  experienced things that i haven't i've experienced things that you haven't
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:42.120]  individually but overall our journeys are very similar
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.680]  and together we can beat this new world order
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.320]  that's what my mission has been a testament to that if we take action
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:56.200]  against corruption we can win and the system knows
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.120]  that it's discredited the system knows that the people are aware
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.960]  of what it's doing the system knows that the population
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.840]  is waking up faster and faster that's why they're desperate
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:10.680]  to inject race into every issue or religion
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.760]  into every issue they need distractions and
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:19.320]  it's just like the movie the truman show as truman wakes up to what's happening
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:23.320]  they try to put more and more fear into him more and more of these fears that
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.240]  were inculcated into truman at birth
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:31.000]  they intensify those and at the final scene of the movie
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.720]  where he's trying to get across the little sea uh to the other side of the set
[01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:39.000]  in this controlled paradigm this controlled reality
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.760]  of the mind that he's in they turn the storm up on high
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.120]  and he has to risk his life and the boat even thumps over
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.800]  and almost kills him but that makes him an even bigger hero
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.760]  and the system at the end knows they can't kill him
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:56.600]  because the whole world is watching
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:00.520]  well my awakening has been similar to the truman show your awakening
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.040]  individually is similar to the truman show or the matrix these are
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.800]  archetypal examples of this but many of us do have to die
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:13.160]  in that little boat trying to get to the other side
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:19.160]  trying to get out of the matrix until the people do see the nature of the
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.000]  tyrants i mean look at this incredible news
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.280]  that rob Jacobson just brought into me a few segments ago
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:30.040]  the ipcc consensus on climate change was phony
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:35.080]  says ipcc insider the un's intergovernmental panel on climate
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.680]  change misled the press and public into believing that thousands of
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.640]  scientists backed its claims on man may global warming according to mike
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.560]  holman a prominent scientist climate scientists and ipcc insider
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.400]  the actual number of scientists who backed the claim was only a few dozen
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:57.080]  experts he states in a paper for progress in physical
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.280]  geography co-authored with student martin Mahoney
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.240]  now we told you this day one they just put two thousand five hundred scientists
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.680]  names on that said every scientist in the world agrees
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:16.280]  the science is set and then thousands of those scientists sent letters in saying
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:19.800]  take my name off i never was part of this this is a fraud
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:25.320]  and the un said no we won't well here's the actual paper
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:31.320]  climate change what do we know about the ipcc
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:39.160]  and it says without a careful explanation about what it means the drive for
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:44.040]  consensus can leave the ipcc vulnerable to outside criticism
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:47.880]  this is quoting from an internal ipcc report that they quote in here
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.800]  claims such as two thousand five hundred of the world's leading
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:56.760]  scientists have reached a consensus that human activities are having a
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:59.960]  significant influence on climate are disingenuous
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:05.160]  that particular consensus judgment as are many others in the ipcc report
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.520]  is reached by only a few dozen experts in the specific field
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:14.760]  of detection and attribution studies well we have the un report from seven
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.040]  months ago that got leaked which the un admits is their report
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:22.520]  from a decade ago where they said we've got to go out and literally finance
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.200]  the heads of these key universities in england australia
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:32.520]  new zealand canada the u.s. and germany to have them be the quote leaders
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:37.320]  of the movement and we're going to get global socialism
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:42.600]  out of this carbon tax i mean what an incredible document that came out
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.040]  we know exactly what's going on here
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:52.600]  and we have the former head of the ipcc told
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:57.240]  jessie ventura they got an interview with a santa
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.120]  bill santa it's amazing what a celebrity can do
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.800]  the people that will talk to ventura the word is on this new season it's

[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:32.120]  week after that and i digress i'm just remembering
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.200]  responsibilities i have like consulting for that show i got a
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.880]  bunch of questions i've got to answer side issue
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.000]  santa admitted yes there were a bunch of scientists
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.880]  in our report and we who do disagreed so we pulled them out
[01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:53.400]  on the inner panel not the two thousand five hundred fake list
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:58.920]  i mean you've got algore coming out and saying
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.840]  this is one hundred percent one hundred percent of scientists
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.680]  a green man mingle the warming is real and is in a real threat to humanity
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:10.200]  and that sea levels will rise and that both the arctic and arctic will
[01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:13.800]  completely melt in the next seven years he said that 10 years ago and again
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:17.080]  three years ago it never happens
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:23.320]  knowing it was all a lie just everyone agrees
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.080]  like saying everyone loves communism or everyone loves nazis
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:32.040]  just there's there's no questioning everyone loves them
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.160]  by the way i don't watch a lot of unfiltered television by filtered i
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:39.160]  end up you know watching videos online that people
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:42.920]  send me and i and my audience kind of i guess filters things because
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.640]  they're just sending me what they're watching or what they're into and it's
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.080]  all new world order i ended up watching probably two hours of
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:53.880]  television this weekend when i was there in the cabin
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.960]  with my kids on a fishing trip and they had satellite tv
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.160]  and i was trying to find stuff for the kids to watch because it was so hot
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:08.440]  during the midday uh you know to be outside fishing and swimming
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:14.040]  and i would try to watch pbs kids shows total brainwashing
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:17.240]  pro vaccine pro world government anti-family
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.000]  you know pro title on your parents i'd flip over to history channel
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  the humans are killing everything everything's bad then i went to a local
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  store they had a children's book about alligators
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.760]  for four dollars i bought it it was all about how humans are evil and killing
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.360]  all the alligators i mean it's just we are bathed in
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.520]  brainwashing it's just it's just everywhere
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:44.280]  you i mean it's just you can't go in a store to buy
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.440]  worms and see a couple of kids books on fishing
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.720]  and there was a book
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.920]  something alligator the big lizard was the name of it
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.720]  i actually own the stinking thing i meant to bring it in here and show it to
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:04.200]  you that's what i mean there's no way how can the public not wake up to this
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.840]  well there it's like it's like being a fish who is
[01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:11.240]  who is who is swimming in all of this propaganda there is so much of it
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.320]  that there's no way to even be able to recognize it when it's one inch away
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:18.440]  from your face but if you pull back and look at it you can see what it is
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:28.280]  clearly
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:31.560]  i said i'd take calls i said i get into the oil spill i said i get into
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:38.040]  chris matthews
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:44.840]  it's just pathomless more and more i realize that i just can't
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.360]  come to grips
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:56.200]  myself with how big this is how real this is
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:01.160]  the globalists know that if they present us something
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.000]  as if it's reality nine times out of ten people will accept it
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.360]  and so they've been introducing a more and more ridiculous version of
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:11.320]  reality a more and more obviously false
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.920]  version but because we bought into all the other previous
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:18.920]  versions of this matrix that's being built around us
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.600]  that now we're literally being inserted into the virtual reality through our
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:26.680]  iPhones and computers and electronics and all those false
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.560]  memes and information they're giving us that we're seeing
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:38.280]  humanity really being suffocated by this propaganda
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.840]  here are some of the headlines america
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:54.600]  america arrested searching for asama bin laden
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.200]  there's another one london guardian food prices to rise by up to 40 percent
[01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.600]  over an extra decade u n report warns
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:12.520]  and you notice that the globalist always poses the saviors
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:17.640]  for the crisis that they themselves create have you ever noticed that
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:22.200]  growing demand from emerging markets for biofuel production will send prices
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.840]  soaring according to oecd and the un food
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:29.000]  agriculture organization when it's the u n that's been pushing for biofuel
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.960]  the whole time that's part of obama's new energy plan
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:40.040]  steel accuses obama of exploiting oil spill for political gain ahead of the
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:44.200]  republican national committee well no kidding
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:49.240]  no kidding sherlock price increases
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:54.440]  fuel fears of food crisis that's the financial times of london article and
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.440]  again the un is going to save us from the problem that they've been
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.600]  tasked with organizing in state department memorandum
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:09.000]  200 alone it's a giant program for the un to create artificial
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.280]  food shortages and wars to reduce population
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:20.200]  nightmare vision for europe as e u chief warns democracy could disappear
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:26.040]  in greece spain and portugal e u began emergency bullion
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:31.080]  pound bailout of spain says democracy could collapse in greece spain and
[01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:33.880]  portugal unless urgent action is taken to tackle debt crisis
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:36.840]  the head of the european commission is warned and then what what are they
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.120]  talking about democracy means giving all your money
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.640]  uh... to the bankers because when you actually read it says
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:47.080]  that they're worried about popular uprisings by the people against the
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:51.720]  banks so democracy means keeping the people out of their government
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.760]  and making sure the banks can turn you on the slaves
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:57.960]  you've got to learn how to decipher what they're saying with the article goes on
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.520]  to say the public is going to overthrow us
[01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:03.720]  well the british ministry of defense of the pentagon in 2007
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:07.080]  both published a detailed report saying the banks are going to have sold all
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.520]  these derivatives it's a debt black hole designed to create a global
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.920]  government and when we implode it the public's going to start rioting as
[01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:18.040]  they go bankrupt and it's going to be our job to suppress them to bring in the
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.800]  new world order i mean i have mpr today calling it
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:26.360]  obama's new world order here it is here's the headline
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:31.160]  battle plan for a new world order
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:34.440]  their entire carbon tax plan was dead
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:37.880]  now obama says he's going to implement it through the epa regardless of what
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.760]  the senate does but praise the house legislation
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.040]  and said he's going to implement it because inaction is not acceptable
[01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.840]  now there he is blocking the dutch blocking the norwegian with their big
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.520]  skimmers that could have handled a lot of it
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:52.440]  not allowing a mass burn day one when the oil was contained
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.720]  and would have burned off at the surface there in one spot before it spread
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:00.680]  wouldn't let the counties and cities and states block the oil in the estuaries
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:06.200]  it's bp the top globalist biggest funder of carbon tax propaganda
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.000]  and bp says they're going to put 20 billion in a
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:16.520]  escrow account based on derivatives when bp is in the top five of hedge funds
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:21.400]  that's nothing for them over the decade 20 billion
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.120]  off the money the banks that own bp are going to get
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.280]  off of the carbon tax bp has invested
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.440]  more than 20 billion and watson's written articles about that in the past
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.400]  they don't care if their name gets destroyed they're in fact i said this
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.280]  last week and now it's been announced they're going to create new names and
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:42.200]  new subsidiaries dying core gets caught running giant child kidnapping rings
[01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:46.360]  they just changed their name they don't care
[01:46:49.240 --> 01:46:52.440]  us president pushes green energy yes
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:55.720]  windmills things that cost two jobs for every job they make
[01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:59.640]  things that are payoffs to his crony buddies
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:04.120]  bainer says obama exploiting crisis
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:11.960]  to push job killing energy tax you guys call watson there's a typo in that
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.720]  says thank you it says obama exploiting crisis to puss
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.000]  job killing energy tax
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.480]  uh and i know that's from bainer's own side i'm sure bainer has the mistake
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:28.040]  let's just fix it for him uh u.s senate republican leader mitch mcconnell
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:31.720]  oval office speech should be an opportunity to unite the country not
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.040]  call for new national energy tax here's another one
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.880]  obama to demand bp pay for oil spill damage
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.040]  they had a 20 meeting a 20 minute meeting it was all on teleprompters
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:49.400]  not a real meeting they just had that here's another article from the
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:55.720]  washington examiner bp was founding member of cap and trade lobby
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:58.120]  and i know we've already covered this at nauseam but it's interesting to see
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:01.160]  another article about it that boils down the actual facts i mean
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:04.680]  they are the greenie meaning mighty weenies
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.400]  i mean they are the ones they are the king daddies bp
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:13.000]  british eugenics petroleum
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.040]  look at this wow jets punch holes in clouds
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.520]  and create rain live science dot com aircraft can accidentally punch holes in
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.720]  clouds leaving a trail of snow or rain in their wake
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.480]  a new study finds oh it turns out all those trails you're seeing oh this
[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:34.200]  chemtrails now suddenly form lower yeah we we happen to have the pentagon
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.120]  document where they talk about how they put the chemicals in the jet fuel that
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:41.720]  are then dispersed by the jet engines oh yeah this chemtrail film i've got
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.240]  coming out in october or november i'm not sure yet it's all documented it's
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:51.080]  all a public secret we're not going with this film isn't about conspiracy
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:54.920]  theories folks but oh now there's all there there is some trails
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:00.680]  oh it's a hot day and you see a trail of two thousand feet that's quite normal
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.600]  turbo prop and jet aircraft that climb or descend under certain atmospheric
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.640]  conditions can invariably trigger what's known as cloud
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.760]  seating the technology is usually associated with schemes to
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:14.120]  control the weather oh
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.800]  however cloud seating can happen by accident as planes soaring through the
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:22.200]  mid-level clouds can leave behind odd shaped holes or
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.800]  channels in the clouds and cause narrow bands of snow or rain to develop and
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:29.720]  fall to the ground uh no these are chemical clouds that just hang up there
[01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:32.760]  holes punched in the clouds are phenomenon that has been recognized for
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.200]  many years and seen in photos around the world a front page feature on yahu
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:41.160]  carried the headline a halo over moscow after photos emerge of just such a hole
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:44.840]  in october and it's a big whitewash here's another one
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:49.080]  new concerns arise over body scanners la times this tells you exactly what we
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:52.440]  covered last year and this year they do not
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.880]  in the dutch and british studies find knives and weapons
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:59.480]  they aren't even as good as x-ray machines but
[01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:03.720]  cherdoff makes a bunch of money and it does biometrically scan your body
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.960]  for passive scanner systems even if you're wearing a mask
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.640]  they can then get your identity on the street and they want your naked images
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.840]  just for their enjoyment and to humiliate you and set the precedent
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.440]  that they dominate you but this admits it and says people
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:23.000]  can also hide bombs and their orifices so the government wants chest x-rays
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.280]  and they are going to do it they'll say we don't care if it gives you cancer
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:29.800]  we're going to chest x-ray it's all about being outrageous
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:34.440]  everything the government's doing now is about being outrageous
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:39.800]  aviation security experts say machines may miss items that metal detectors
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.240]  catch airline passengers may also be able to hide materials
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:46.680]  in their groiner body cavities
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:52.200]  there's another one coming soon unmanned aircraft all over us skies
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:56.120]  there's another one federal judge cites voting rights act to rig elections in
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:01.640]  new york yeah you now get six votes

[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:18.520]  back at the start of the yawn right
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:25.160]  began to thank Matt Drudge and I do want to thank him for the tremendous
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.720]  traffic he's sending info wars.com and
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:33.320]  prisonplanet.com well that's got the system hopping mad millions of new visitors
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:38.040]  a week to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com from Matt Drudge
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:42.920]  and he linked to Paul Watson's article about flick of a switch
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:46.920]  allows Obama to shut down the internet
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.920]  and that's actually what the national security strategy
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:55.240]  may 2010 report says now last year they had said
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.000]  cyber security gives him the power to shut the web off but now the White House
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.840]  says that in their own words so sure this is newsworthy information
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:10.120]  but to have it up on the Drudge report we would have probably had maybe 100,000
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.040]  viewers read that article on our website then hundreds of
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:16.840]  other sites would have posted it so all totaled
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.120]  you know quite a few would have seen it but now because Drudge links to it
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:25.000]  when Drudge links that then makes all the other media start reading it because
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.520]  I've been a national radio host offices I've been in national media studios
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.400]  I've been everywhere and you see the Drudge report open
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:36.360]  you know that so much of the Drudge reports traffic
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:41.080]  is media I mean it really sets the agenda
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:47.160]  and that's why the old line media is dying and the and and the new media
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:49.400]  like the Drudge report just gets bigger and bigger
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.240]  because Drudge will link to a clip of Herman von Roompi
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:59.000]  calling for world government and defining it as a banking dictatorship
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:03.240]  Drudge will link to Gordon Brown calling for world government
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:07.480]  he will link to Obama calling for it I mean you got Chris Matthews saying
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:10.200]  none of this exists out of one side of his mouth
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:13.560]  while all these world leaders and the UN are setting up world government
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.080]  well Drudge just says hey the emperors wearing no clothes
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.280]  that's what info wars.com is and present planet.com
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:23.880]  is we're like the three-year-old in the parade
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:28.200]  here comes the king butt naked no one wants to say he's naked
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  and the three-year-old steps forward and says the emperor is naked
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.280]  and so we appreciate the Drudge report
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:39.160]  because they're helping us reach a lot of new people
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:43.320]  I also want to thank coast to coast AM they've been instrumental in the last
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.480]  six and a half seven years having me on reaching tens of millions they have
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:51.240]  16 million listeners conservatively
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.960]  so they've helped us reach a lot of new people we're very thankful to coast to
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:59.080]  coast AM and George Norrie for his courage on that front
[01:56:59.080 --> 01:57:01.400]  and you can say what you want about Drudge you can say what you want about
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.920]  George Norrie say what you want about me you know we all
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.880]  are appealing to you know different types of audiences
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:14.680]  but we're all mavericks we're all you know covering things from our
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:19.960]  perspective and trailblazing and I just can't believe that I'm in
[01:57:19.960 --> 01:57:25.800]  company you know with people like Matt Drudge
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.320]  because of my message I mean it is an extreme message I mean
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:32.280]  we have this article out that I'm begging everyone to get to everyone they
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:36.680]  know MSNBC and cover-up of manifestly
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:40.200]  provable population control plan because that's the big
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.720]  you know the TV show tonight that airs uh what time is the stupid rise of the
[01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:48.680]  right air they've been hyping up like it's the new
[01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:52.040]  star wars movie coming out or something
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:57.000]  uh it ends saying Alex Jones thinks the government wants to kill us and in
[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.520]  TV newscasts for TV newscasts they've had building up to this
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.720]  they keep bringing up the fact that Alex Jones thinks the government wants to
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.480]  kill you I don't think anything Matthews and
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:10.840]  you're not stupid you worked in the White House with the bigger Brzezinski

[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:31.160]  well when i take three days off i've got a lot i want to say a lot i want to
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.760]  talk about but now we're going to take your calls
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:40.040]  john chad tim jim ruben and others will continue with open phones in the fourth
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:42.760]  hour today
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.000]  and i've only scratched the surface on the news
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.160]  coming up i will get to it i will play chris matthew's last night with pat
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.680]  Buchanan trying to demonize pat Buchanan to myself
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:58.920]  and some of the ways they came at us i want to analyze that
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:02.040]  and then i am going to get more into the oil spill and my take on it
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.960]  uh but let's go to john in ohio john you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.600]  hey alex you know any more as much as i'm reading and i was just like you i was
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.840]  basically kind of conservative libertarian when i was like 19 or 20 but
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:18.680]  the more i read and the more i've understand it i said this isn't the
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:22.680]  united states of america anymore this is the united colonies of great britain
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:26.840]  under that queen over there because she is basically her and her banking
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:29.800]  minions have been pretty much bought out our money supply
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:33.960]  1913 and they've consolidated more and more and more
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:38.360]  and now with barack obama in there who is by their law british subject
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:41.240]  she pretty much has us by the short hairs
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:45.560]  well we're going to get john colman back on who was in british intelligence
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.680]  uh and who was of course his constitutional lawyer
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.920]  and not the british people but the british empire system
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.440]  and that wealth the sun never settled the british empire when the british
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:00.440]  empire started getting resistance they just took their flag down but used their
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:03.640]  covert corporate governance that's what carol quigley at
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.080]  georgetown said that's what zygna brzezinski says
[02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:10.120]  that's what helmut schmidt the former german chancellor said
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:14.120]  that's what the japanese leaders i mean they all say
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.560]  the british corporate model dominates the earth
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:20.920]  you've got the israeli stripe in there because the founders of israel
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.880]  the roth childs are also a big part of the british empire
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:27.960]  uh but it but it is the anglo-american dutch interest
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.440]  created the model of covert corporate governance
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:36.520]  and that's what we're going into even deeper right now it's a great point by
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:41.240]  the way when's john colman on is he back on this week
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.240]  okay go ahead and finish your point caller um basically um alex i've been
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:48.440]  reading i i've read a lot of books i'm reading this new book about
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.120]  george the third where he said freedom of speech is a good thing every man in
[02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:56.600]  britain has the right to express themselves but only within the parameters
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.800]  of the law and so i read that i said this is what
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:04.200]  we're headed to it's limited freedoms limited everything and eventually what
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:07.960]  they want is no freedom at all it's a revocation of magdakarta and all these
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:11.160]  other you have a second amendment and the second
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.040]  amendment means under the law the government can ban it or restrict it
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:16.440]  down to nothing you have a right to free speech the
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:21.800]  speech the government says is okay and now we see open everywhere
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.440]  where the media every day says we need the police to be able to secretly arrest
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:29.400]  you and have you disappear you know just like in
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:36.120]  rome take him away take him to the dungeon no trial no nothing this is the
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:43.320]  cornerstone the fulcrum the heart around which all tyranny orbits is
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:47.000]  secret arrest no due process and they are promoting it
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.360]  as if it is mother's milk i mean how much more
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.960]  obvious does it have to get it's ridiculous alex and i just
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.720]  i think we have just woken up to it in time
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.400]  but most of us did not realize that in nineteen thirteen that they bought out
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.160]  our currency most of us didn't realize that in eighteen ninety three andrew
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:09.640]  carnegie wrote a uh... essay on the reunion of america with the british
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:15.640]  empire most of us didn't even realize that this neopagan bloodline that goes
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:18.920]  all the way from britain all the way back through france and all the way
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:22.600]  back through venice and god knows where it went before that this
[02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:26.200]  evil line of people they've masqueraded as christians for years
[02:04:26.200 --> 02:04:29.880]  but what they want to do is they want to institute some worldwide pagan
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:33.480]  religion and bring back these bad you're absolutely right when they knocked off
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:34.760]  their cousins
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:39.000]  in the french revolution they went to attend a week nine days of work they
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:42.440]  changed the months they want to overturn the existing order
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.040]  and you said it even if they're not the merovingian line
[02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.960]  the queen of england all of them on record say they believe that the merovingian
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.360]  line that they are
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:57.800]  the the the the the the progeny of jesus christ and mary magland
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.080]  they are lunatics who think they're god
[02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:04.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:05.560]  solar power generator
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:09.480]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:05:09.480 --> 02:05:13.800]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.640]  electric company allows you to have
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:19.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:21.240]  technology is coming
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:32.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:05:35.080 --> 02:05:38.840]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:41.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:32.440]  demonization piece we talked about it some last week when somebody inside
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.320]  msnbc was concerned sent us a script we've seen promos now for the rise of
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.280]  the right that's going to air three times today
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:44.600]  three times what at five seven and midnight uh eastern
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.840]  on msnbc and it's exactly what we thought it would be and more
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:52.120]  so that's coming up and i want to give you my skinny on the oil spill
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:56.840]  obama is now saying 20 billion to be paid by bp that they're going to pay all
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:58.840]  of it i don't believe any of that they're one of
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.800]  his biggest campaign contributors just like last year in the stimulus bill
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.240]  obama said i'm against ceo's getting bailout money
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.400]  then he pressured senator dodd and dodd released these emails
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:16.920]  uh from the white house to add a provision where retroactively all the
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:21.160]  big companies goldman sacks jp morgan chase uh
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.240]  warren buffett's uh wells fargo city bank all of them
[02:09:25.240 --> 02:09:30.760]  got to retroactively keep all the bonuses and bonuses going forward
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:37.080]  and that some small companies had to be under the regulations again unfair
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:41.720]  trade practices that's what the banking association
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:44.120]  is also said about the new banking bill that just passed
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:47.320]  here in texas our banking association the president of it said this is the
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:50.520]  groups that sold derivatives this is the big criminal mega banks
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:53.960]  we're healthy banks this allows them to take us over and what do you see federal
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.480]  regulators do filled with goldman sacks jp morgan
[02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.960]  uh former execs just who all hold stock in these companies like congress does
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:05.400]  many members of congress just gobbling up as fast as they can
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:13.640]  healthy banks and insurance companies uh and credit unions
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:17.400]  so when obama says i'm gonna get tough he knows you'll forget about this in six
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:21.080]  months a year uh you look for the taxpayer to pay
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:24.360]  for it and we know that's what green taxes mean
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:28.120]  you know green energy oh we need to have that carbon tax we need to have a
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:32.440]  fuel oil tax we'd have a wellhead tax a car tax
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:39.640]  a gas tax on on propane on natural gas that's what's in his plan
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:44.680]  he said my plan through the epa separate from the senate passing it is
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:48.680]  what the house passed that is cap and trade
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.240]  which is what bp always wanted and now you know the bp ceo dumped his stock at
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:55.800]  record levels you know goldman sacks that was
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:01.720]  sharing bp the head of bp was co-chairing
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:06.120]  the head of goldman sacks was co-chairing bp and the list goes on and on
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.280]  inside job inside job blocking the response by the states
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:13.640]  blocking the response by private corporations blocking the response by
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.920]  foreign governments letting the oil get into shore
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:20.280]  and then not capping it they're gonna let that thing leak
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:26.760]  until they get your money and the public's been sucked into whining about
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:30.120]  it oh i'm still angry do something obama do something and they're like
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:35.080]  you want us to do something we will are you sure we're gonna put a tax on you
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.880]  to bp that set up the carbon tax you will have you pay taxes to the subsidiary
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:43.800]  banks of bp that'll show him that's right you show him obama
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.720]  you get tough with him right now
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:53.000]  problem reaction solution they create the crisis the public gets all upset about
[02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:56.200]  it the media says what are they gonna do about it
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.120]  meaning the mainstream media the mainstream media
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:03.160]  says what are they gonna do about it to the government
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.920]  and the government says we'll put taxes on you and take all your rights
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.280]  kind of like obama had one of his people on fox news this morning one of his
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:14.760]  spokesman saying just like it 9-11 we didn't like it happening but we used it
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  to get freedom in america to protect the people from terrorist take all your
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:21.560]  freedom giving you your freedom the patriot act
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:24.520]  the new freedom initiative it's always has an orwellian name
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:29.880]  and and so they're they're they're not letting a good crisis go to waste
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:33.000]  let's go to chad in ohio chad you're on the air go ahead
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:37.160]  outstanding hey alex uh back in 2009 2009 of may
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.200]  i went to renew my license here in hawking county in ohio
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.200]  um they told me my license had been suspended by the state of north carolina
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.960]  so i had to call the state of north carolina i talked to them i said uh
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:51.080]  you know this is chad jerry's wild callings uh you know my license were
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:54.440]  suspended and i want to know why well they said you had a ticket of february of
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:57.160]  01 i said well i was stationed with the marine corps i was in the navy but i
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:00.360]  stayed with the marines at that time i said that's true i paid that ticket she
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:03.960]  looked it up she said yet you did i said so what's going on she said well
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:06.920]  the department of motor vehicles of north carolina gave you another traffic
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:09.720]  violation for driving 20 miles over the speed limit
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.000]  and i said you know i i've never been told about this that's what you're
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.200]  telling me is that for eight years in renewing my license twice in eight
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.640]  years you're just now telling me about this and uh she wouldn't tell me what
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:23.080]  was going on but i did my research and what i found out was about the real
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:27.320]  id act and um i i'm even a government employee
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:30.440]  and they're starting to well not starting but they're putting those boxes
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.920]  in the ceilings to where when you walk in a radio wave comes in hits your card and
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.560]  goes back but they're here ultimately the fact of
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.200]  it is is that the state of ohio is now issuing a national id card of course
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.640]  they went to a new enhanced uh drivers license yeah for those that don't know
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:48.360]  for those that don't know i get questions all the time
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.240]  about how did you get your driver's license because i famously got arrested
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.960]  refusing to thumbprint uh in austin texas in 1997 i had the executive order
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.720]  about how it was a national id card how they were going to use it for buying and
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.400]  selling how they were going to track everything we did they said ultimately in
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.080]  the executive order they're going to take our blood at the driver's license
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.040]  facility that's why they're getting you trained right now with cops
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:18.600]  and license plate reading cameras uh have already given everybody tickets for
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.960]  speeding and what they're now going to phase in is
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:25.640]  points on your license and most americans in the next year or two are
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.760]  going to be told you no longer have your driver's license
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:32.360]  you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines with interest
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:36.200]  for all these hundreds and hundreds of times you were caught speeding
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:41.720]  camera at point a said that you went from point a to camera at point b at an
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:45.960]  average speed of 81 miles an hour and so you're going to be given tickets
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:51.080]  and again the pentagon put in the the license plate readers 15 years ago
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:54.600]  for at least 10 years it's going into federal databases
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:58.040]  uh anybody who didn't have insurance one of my employees
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:15:04.040]  nine years ago didn't have insurance uh he was given a ticket he paid for it
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:06.920]  they don't care they suspended his license for a month
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.360]  they said you got to pay all these giant fines retroactively
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:14.280]  and come in and prove you have insurance now but the illegals are above the law
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.560]  they're released so this this cashless system
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:22.040]  is already in and they're already tracking the slaves everywhere they go
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.400]  and so that's probably how you got that ticket even though you don't remember
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:29.240]  being pulled over by a cop go ahead and and so now
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:32.360]  they're also saying under the real id and i have my texas driver's license i
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.240]  went ahead and got one because i couldn't get on airplanes i couldn't
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:38.600]  live you know i mean i'm inside nazi germany people ask why do i have my
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:42.040]  nazi papers well because i have to be able to move around in the resistance
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:44.760]  if i don't have it i'll get picked up even quicker because i'm not i'm not a
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.640]  legal alien who's above the law part of the program and it says usa texas
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:53.640]  and it's a national id card it's got national id barcode on the back and
[02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.680]  it's just a glorified federal id and it tracks everything i do
[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:03.560]  and this is my slave control card and they've now said
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.120]  that when your license gets suspended you're going to be automatically fired
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:10.600]  from your job and there's going to be tens of thousands
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.360]  of dollars of fines a month see they're not going to ever bust the illegals
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.920]  you're going to have to have an id card to have a job
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.520]  and if you haven't paid taxes they're not going to allow you to have a job and
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:25.240]  you've got to voluntarily go turn yourself in on a work release program
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:28.360]  for forced labor but it's to pay the taxes quote
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.720]  so it's not forced labor to the government this is high tech
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:35.480]  slavery everyone is going to enjoy it sorry go ahead
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:38.920]  oh well uh number one you're absolutely right uh our our driver's license here
[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:41.320]  in the state of ohio pay attention to people in ohio
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:44.920]  uh do say usa driver's license and they just started that within a year and a
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.520]  half again i didn't know any of this until 2009
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.960]  also in my county uh they started already putting uh what
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:55.720]  if they did uh they put the license plate scanners on the back of their cop
[02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.560]  cruisers and the sheriff cruisers i actually went in and i took a vietnam
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:02.920]  veteran two purple hearts in there with me uh asked them who
[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:06.280]  how who purchased those he told me the department of homeland security
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:10.520]  i asked him who uh are those for revenue don't bring a veteran in with purple
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.280]  hearts if those cops have been brainwashed that means you're bad
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.080]  it doesn't it's not good to be a veteran anymore according to their homeland
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.840]  security training that veteran is it is a potential terrorist
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:24.040]  who's trying to stop them from taking all the money to the banks but sorry go
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:26.440]  ahead no you're you're you're right brother well i'm the
[02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:31.560]  veteran too and uh terrorist terrorist yeah i i i wanted to take
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:35.080]  i just wanted him to know uh what was going on after if you ever knew about
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:38.840]  the real id act and and also i showed him my old military license because they
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:40.920]  never they never take it back from you they
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:44.120]  conveniently allow you to leave with it but what's happening is now in our
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:46.920]  federal uh even our federal government positions
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.960]  uh people are getting issued new driver new id badges
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:52.760]  and what they're doing is the government is setting up actual things in the
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:55.320]  ceilings to send off radio waves it's happening here in
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:00.200]  ohio it's it's a fact uh what it is it's tracking device just imagine if you
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:03.960]  were to go listen listen that's the whole point of course there's RFID in the
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:07.960]  passports in the driver's license and the government is putting readers up
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:10.360]  they were caught 12 years ago in san francisco
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:14.120]  uh with their uh because they had a a test there but some of their license
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:17.960]  that had it and now everywhere they ping and they read
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:23.320]  everywhere you're going sir so of course i mean you're a prisoner continue
[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.400]  well uh i decided to do something about it i'm i'm done tired of uh you know i
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:30.360]  never really out of my tv but i was naive for many of years of
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:33.400]  like i said i was in the military i've seen things that i probably
[02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:37.240]  shouldn't have seen and heard uh but that's beside the fact that the real
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:40.680]  fact that it is is that american people really need to stand up for themselves
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.080]  and actually do something uh a lot of apathy and people just talk
[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:48.520]  and uh so i decided to run for a state house representative
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.200]  and i'd love to give you my website yeah go ahead and give it to us so anything
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:59.480]  yeah it's www dot ricketts r i c k e t t s uh for state rep dot com
[02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:03.240]  and uh that's i'm running under a libertarian ticket uh uh the dem the
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.600]  republican party in in my county told me that the democrats are doing a pretty
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:10.200]  good job so that right there was a telltale sign that says hey
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:12.920]  uh there's serious issues in this in this county
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:16.760]  uh not only in this my county but there's a luminati set up everywhere
[02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:20.040]  and uh it's really time for people to uh just wake up
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:23.720]  we need some leadership honestly and uh i'm not going to be able to do it all
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:26.600]  myself of course not alex jones will not be able to do it all
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:30.520]  himself but the fact that it is as we need people just to get involved
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.200]  especially in ohio we do we do because again
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:37.960]  we're individually all being isolated and there's control grids being put in
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:43.000]  we must recognize this grid is being put in to rob the daylights out of us and
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.920]  militarily suppress us so this crime can be expanded
[02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:50.840]  and committed i mean look look at this article and i've seen the court documents
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:53.080]  we've been talking to bruno for the last week and a half
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:56.680]  we are change la organizer faces terrorist charge
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:00.680]  for facial expressions in court

[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:15.320]  silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[02:20:15.320 --> 02:20:18.600]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:22.680]  written by alex newman for the new american magazine
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:25.800]  dealing with the ways that the private fellow deserve network
[02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:29.480]  has a rigged economy here in the united states and i will get to that
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:34.360]  chris matthew's video from last night dealing with his hit piece
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:38.040]  but right now let's go ahead and talk to tim in oregon
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.680]  tim you're on the air welcome hello yes sir
[02:24:42.680 --> 02:24:45.640]  yeah i have a couple just a few quick questions i won't take a much of your
[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:48.520]  time i was curious and if you had any uh
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.520]  conclusive coverage on me will still like an internet database real-time
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:57.080]  evidence video or anything that anybody can now look up
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:59.880]  well i mean i mean there's video of it gushing
[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:04.600]  60 000 gallons a day they say now and them lying from day one
[02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:09.800]  saying it was a few thousand gallons than 10 000 and 20 000 and 30 000 and 40 000
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:14.760]  and 50 000 uh than 60 000 uh and there's the fact
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.800]  that i do anybody can pull up the mainstream articles that
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:24.440]  44 percent of bp stock uh was dumped by goldman sacks two days before a record
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:28.360]  dumping in just that stock uh and of course now it turns out that bp was
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.480]  being chaired at the time by the head of goldman sacks
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:36.920]  now you have the ceo of bp dumping 30 plus percent or over a third of his stock
[02:25:36.920 --> 02:25:40.280]  in bp you have the fact that they block their response you have the fact that
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:43.880]  bp's a top globalist company pushing carbon taxes
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:47.720]  uh you have the fact that obama now as we predicted a month ago
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:50.840]  is calling for his global carbon tax as a solution
[02:25:50.840 --> 02:25:54.920]  taxes on the american people to the very company bp that owns
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:00.920]  large stakes in the carbon trading scam uh but i mean there's your proof right
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:03.720]  there well no i'm i'm just necessarily looking for
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:07.640]  like ordinary citizens to just like look in and witness the devastation
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:11.400]  beef you know in real time i would say the devastation early well i mean they
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:16.200]  do have uh goons from haliburton bp trying to keep the
[02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:19.880]  media off public beaches over hundreds of miles of public
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:23.160]  beaches uh trying to stop americans from seeing the
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.840]  oil spill though from what i've seen it's bad but
[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:32.120]  a lot worse uh you know to come because most of it's still out in the ocean
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:38.600]  in those different currents so a lot of its media hype and
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:45.160]  and and i went to lubies yesterday they had big signs saying our food is from
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:48.840]  uh the north atlantic it's from alaska it's from the northern pacific it's
[02:26:48.840 --> 02:26:51.800]  from iceland uh you know it's from all these other
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.320]  places and most of the food's good in the gulf i mean it's just a bunch of hype
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:01.800]  i mean sure 50 million gallons sounds like a lot until you realize there's
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:05.240]  got to be trillions and trillions and trillions of gallons of water in the
[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:08.840]  gulf of mexico i mean the oil
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:14.360]  that's come out of this oil rig is not even a drop of oil in a swimming pool
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:18.200]  do you understand thank you for that perspective i appreciate that i also
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:22.760]  had a few other questions for you let them um if martial law takes place do
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.120]  you think it'll be a coast to coast thing like um from the pacific to the
[02:27:26.120 --> 02:27:29.240]  aurelantic or will be a state uh the state event
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.760]  okay we're under martial law police all over the country take blood without
[02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:36.440]  warrants at checkpoints all babies for 38 years have had their blood secretly
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:39.480]  taken at birth and put in a Pentagon database that's martial law the
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.320]  military has been trained for over 30 years in covert operations with local
[02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:48.520]  police to take on american gun owners that's martial law over 50 000 clergy
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:52.840]  have have been trained on what to preach to their flock to submit to government
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:56.840]  and to hand in their guns that's that's creepy you know martial law
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:00.680]  uh you know that's like the tv show v but it's not aliens infiltrating it's
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:05.880]  our own people i mean this is tyranny face-scanning cameras license plate
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.400]  reading cameras a government that that that secretly
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:15.080]  arrest citizens that's martial law so it's what increment of martial law will
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:18.120]  we be under will they have some hot martial law
[02:28:18.120 --> 02:28:25.560]  like Katrina uh where they confiscate guns and things like that
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:29.160]  i mean you know that's the question that is the question
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:33.400]  um so it'd be more of an event type of situation versus just a
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:38.520]  state-to-state sweep you're thinking well i mean they already have state-to-state
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:41.720]  sweeps uh they i've got all these squad car videos
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:44.680]  where they have a checkpoint they're searching people's papers and they
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:47.960]  happen to see a pocket constitution in the front seat and they take the woman
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:50.440]  off instead of being jewish like in nazi
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:54.280]  germany she's a patriot and the cops are so brainwashed
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.120]  they think george washington you know they think a constant constitution with
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:02.200]  george washington's face on it is as scary as satan
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:05.800]  uh and so what i'm saying is it's martial law
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:09.640]  when henry paulson in closed-door session of congress said
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:13.640]  martial law will be declared blood in the streets quote
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:17.640]  this is on record if you don't give us unlimited trillions
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:22.440]  so see martial law is when they launch illegal wars i mean
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:25.800]  nazi germany was under martial law by 1933
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:29.560]  when hitler fire bombed his own capital they didn't announce martial law it's
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:32.200]  called security they don't call it martial law in
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:36.440]  north korea it's just tyranny i mean do you see what i'm saying
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:40.360]  but they could set off a nuke and declare national emergency
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:44.600]  and maybe even use the term martial law just to throw it in our face
[02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:48.840]  uh so that would come after the globalist set off a nuke and blamed it on
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:51.880]  one of their made-up enemies i hope that answers your questions
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:58.120]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:46.600]  a couple short clips from msnbc where they're calling for obama to be a
[02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:50.120]  dictator because a dictator can get stuff done man on a
[02:33:50.120 --> 02:33:52.840]  white horse you know give us adolf hitler he'll fix

[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:16.280]  and upwards of 20 times total because i talked to msnbc they say it'll probably
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.200]  year 20 times and msnbc was completely deceptive
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:27.160]  but what do i do chicken out and not go on fox not go on cnn not go on msnbc
[02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:31.080]  i saw some people criticizing me even being interviewed for the piece uh you

[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:03.080]  alex newman of the new american alex you've got the floor for the next 22
[02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:05.240]  minutes we've got left in the sour i appreciate
[02:38:05.240 --> 02:38:08.520]  you coming on on short notice but i saw your article dealing with the
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:12.120]  redistribution of wealth and i know people understand the feds of fraud
[02:38:12.120 --> 02:38:14.920]  but your article speaking to the experts doing the research
[02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:22.760]  really in just uh ten pages or so condenses it down and easy to understand
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:26.360]  language and it's so important to get this information out to everybody
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:29.480]  because this is how this illegitimate new world order gets all its power as you
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:34.120]  know uh so walk us through this well thanks for having me on alex and
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:37.960]  yeah basically it's it's what you said it's this huge scheme
[02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.440]  and so what i did with this story i started by looking at uh
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.800]  basically real estate and the stock market and i started noticing that the fed
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:51.880]  was you know printing trillions of dollars and giving it to their friends
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:55.480]  at the banks and you know a lot of this is well known now from testimony in
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:58.600]  congress and stuff where he was admitting that they printed 500 billion
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:01.560]  dollars and gave it to foreign central banks so they could give it to their
[02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:05.480]  banks um and so what they did was they saw the
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:09.640]  banking sector was collapsing and so they printed the tons and tons of money
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:12.040]  and just handed it out to their friends
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:15.960]  and then when you start looking even deeper you see that this gets
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:19.480]  even worse than what's on the surface already terrible
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:22.840]  they the federal reserve bank of new york you can even check this out on their
[02:39:22.840 --> 02:39:26.040]  website actually at new york fed dot org they have
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:30.200]  information about these front companies that they created uh it was made in
[02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:33.160]  lane one made in lane two and made in lane three their
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:36.840]  llc's limited liability companies incorporated in delaware
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.400]  and essentially what the fed did was just printed money out of thin air gave
[02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:46.520]  it to these companies and the company started buying up garbage from
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:51.160]  companies like aig uh companies like bear stern
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.160]  and what this did was it just basically put tons of money in the pocket so
[02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:01.400]  banks like goldman sacks and jp morgan so imagine investors the the way i came
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:04.600]  across the story in the first place with a guy called william pit he's a
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:09.320]  developer and an investor down in florida and he started telling people
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:12.760]  that he hadn't he had uh sold some of his stock in the big
[02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.000]  financial companies and uh he had bought short positions on
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.360]  on city bank and bank of america and these kinds of things
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:24.840]  and he even bought some exchange traded funds that would
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:29.160]  go up in value as real estate and the financials went down
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.840]  and so instead of making a fortune which would have been
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:36.520]  the natural consequence of properly reading the market you know real estate
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:40.280]  was a huge mess the banks were a mess what happened was
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:43.720]  the fed started bailing them all out without any authorization from
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:47.320]  congress of course the constitution says congress should allocate money
[02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:51.160]  but what happened here was the fed just started bailing out all these companies
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.720]  and so investors who properly read the market who saw what was going on
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:40:59.240]  lost their money and insiders made a fortune because they knew what was
[02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.280]  going to happen they knew what actions the fed was going to take
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.160]  and then from there you can look at basically any segment of the economy
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:11.400]  and you see that it's being rigged by the fed or reserve
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:14.840]  for example the precious metals market a lot has come out
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.000]  in the last few months here but even before that we had alan green span in
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.720]  1998 he went to congress and he told them that
[02:41:21.720 --> 02:41:25.400]  as the price of gold rises the central bank is going to lease out increasing
[02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:29.240]  quantities so basically if the price of gold goes up the fed is going to keep it
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.720]  down by leasing out some of its gold
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.440]  supplies and so that's good for the fed it's good for the banks but it's
[02:41:38.440 --> 02:41:41.720]  obviously bad for the people it's bad for the government
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:46.760]  and then more recently too we had a commodities future trade commission
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:49.960]  meeting and there was some really explosive testimony
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:53.480]  there i was a little bit upset they didn't get more media coverage
[02:41:53.480 --> 02:41:59.960]  but you had for example andrew mcguire he was a metals trader in london
[02:41:59.960 --> 02:42:05.480]  and he came out and flat out said that the fed or reserve was through its
[02:42:05.480 --> 02:42:10.360]  agents jp morgan and so forth stopping the rise in the prices of gold and
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:13.000]  silver and that it was being insulated from
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:16.360]  many potential losses by the fed and the taxpayer
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:20.280]  so again you know we have this manipulation in the precious metals
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:24.120]  market you have the manipulations and stocks and bonds and the ways that
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:27.080]  they're bailing out the banks it's too many to count
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.160]  you have the fed giving the banks money and then the banks the commercial
[02:42:31.160 --> 02:42:34.920]  banks put the money back with the fed and the fed pays them interest
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:39.320]  you have the fed with interest rates extremely low right now obviously
[02:42:39.320 --> 02:42:43.000]  artificially and then what the commercial banks are
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.960]  doing they're taking this fed money at virtually no interest
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:51.160]  and they're buying us treasury securities with it so the taxpayer is basically
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:54.680]  funding profits for the banks because the treasury security
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:58.120]  they have a much higher interest rates than what the fed is charging right now
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:01.880]  for commercial banks to borrow from them so basically they're doing nothing
[02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:05.160]  and they're getting a huge bailout from the it's not even a bailout it's just a
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.520]  theft they're just taking money from taxpayers by doing nothing
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:12.600]  by taking money from the fed at almost no interest and just loaning it to the
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:16.040]  u.s. government and making a fortune off of the backs of people who pay their
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:20.280]  taxes so this is just in so many ways the fed
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:24.440]  is ripping off the american people and then when you get past the
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:28.200]  market manipulations the manipulation of stocks bonds gold
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:33.000]  silver all these things then you have the biggest manipulation of
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.840]  of all manipulations it's the manipulation of the money supply
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.200]  with their control of the money supply
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:43.400]  aside from being a debt trap which i'll get to in just a moment
[02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:48.040]  it creates the boom and bust cycle and it allows their friends to get rich
[02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:51.720]  while americans uh you know get in
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:55.640]  debt and well it's actually it's a permanent debt it's a debt that we can't
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:43:59.880]  ever pay back because when the fed loans out money
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:03.000]  you're stuck in a situation where you have to pay interest on that money
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:06.600]  but they never created the interest so i'm sure a lot of your
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:10.600]  your listeners are familiar with this already but but i mean it's you can't
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:13.880]  emphasize it enough it's not that if there was good
[02:44:13.880 --> 02:44:17.080]  people running the fed this would all be okay it's
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:21.880]  it's literally a trap it's a Ponzi scheme and it cannot continue indefinitely
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:25.000]  it'll work as long as they can keep finding new people to keep borrowing new
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.200]  money into the system so that people can pay off the old debt with the old
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:31.000]  interest but when people stop borrowing the money
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.920]  then you get a collapse and you know all this
[02:44:34.920 --> 02:44:38.600]  printing of money it's bankrupting americans through inflation when we
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:42.360]  originally got the fed the dollar was worth
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  something like our dollar today is worth something like five cents
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:49.160]  compared to the dollar when we originally got the better reserve and
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:51.800]  that's just all the theft against the american people
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:56.360]  and the money goes to finance big government it goes to finance the wars
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:45:02.440]  and it goes to finance this incredible wealth that the elite class has amassed
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:05.560]  by manipulating the system to its advantage
[02:45:05.560 --> 02:45:09.640]  it's you know it kind of leaves you at a loss for words we're
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.080]  in my opinion this is one of the single biggest issues that we need to solve if
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:17.160]  we hope to get america back on the right track because as long as we don't have
[02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:21.400]  honest money we're never going to have a proper economy and you can never say we
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.280]  have a free market because they're manipulating the
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:29.880]  market for money that's the most crucial basic thing in an economy and it's
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:32.440]  you know it's a central planning commission we know that central planning
[02:45:32.440 --> 02:45:35.480]  doesn't work but that's exactly what these guys at the
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:39.000]  federal reserve board are doing they they just arbitrarily pick an interest
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.240]  rate whatever they think is but they say that it's you know they're doing it in
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:46.760]  our interest that you know you can think whatever you want about that
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:51.640]  central planning
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:56.440]  are you still there alex
[02:45:56.440 --> 02:46:00.440]  okay well we were talking to our guests i was sitting there
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.440]  listening to him break everything down in an eloquent fashion
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:11.720]  reading along with his article and we lost him on his phone system
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:14.920]  or it might have been our phone system so we'll get alex
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:22.760]  newman back on with us here just as soon as we can again his article is fed
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:26.600]  manipulations in the crosshairs and while he's been talking i've been going
[02:46:26.600 --> 02:46:31.000]  over some of the articles i have u k u genesis demand we need a global
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:35.240]  initiative for population reduction we need a global debate on population
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:42.120]  now london independent corporate media follows government orders
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:52.920]  runs excuse me
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:58.040]  oh and it rains at pours lose our guests and suddenly
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:04.600]  i've got a parched throat here corporate media follows government orders
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:12.440]  runs defense for the ethridge assault we've been covering that up continuing
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.720]  on the carbon tax front Lieberman says pay one dollar a day
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:20.680]  for climate
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:27.720]  okay going back to alex alex we uh lost your phone line there please continue
[02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:32.440]  where you left off yeah so i mean there's we're
[02:47:32.440 --> 02:47:36.040]  literally in a really bad situation unfortunately the rest of the world is
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:40.440]  in this situation with us almost every country has a central bank that operates
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:45.160]  similarly to ours and you know some people think that the federal reserve is
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:48.440]  a government agent it's really important for people to understand that it's
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:53.640]  not what it is is the a banking cartel and i think cartel really is the best
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:57.720]  word to describe it because the way it's structured you have 12 regional
[02:47:57.720 --> 02:48:02.360]  federal reserve banks and each one is owned by its member banks that they're
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:05.560]  basically shareholders and the federal reserve admits to this recently when
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:08.520]  they were sued by bloomberg uh freedom of
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.200]  information request trying to figure out where that two trillion in emergency
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:16.440]  lending went uh the fed admitted the federal reserve bank of
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:19.960]  new york filed a supplementary brief saying that we're a private
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.080]  institution we're owned by private shareholders our board members are
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:26.520]  appointed by our private shareholders you can't force this to disclose anything
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:29.560]  we're not subject to the freedom of information act because we're not part
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:33.960]  of the government and so far the courts have not bought that
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:37.160]  argument so bloomberg is making some progress on the lawsuit they
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:40.120]  they won on appeal as well the fed appealed the decision
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:44.200]  and bloomberg was successful on the appeal but the fed is still refusing to
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:47.960]  hand over the document so that's one component of
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:52.680]  the it's estimated now at twenty seven trillion dollars in potential liabilities
[02:48:52.680 --> 02:48:57.160]  that the fed has put us on the line for and to put that number in perspective
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:00.600]  the u.s economy that our gross domestic product
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:03.880]  is in the neighborhood of 13 trillion so
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:07.560]  dummy this figure is so startling that comes out to about
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.040]  seventy five thousand dollars per person in the united states including
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:15.400]  children uh so if you can imagine yourself paying
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:20.040]  back seventy five thousand dollars for the actions of the fed which
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:22.920]  you know they had they haven't even benefited you if anything they
[02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.080]  they're helping to bankrupt you and now you're on the line to pay for it all
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:31.480]  so i mean this should really outrage people i i think like ron paul
[02:49:31.480 --> 02:49:34.920]  it's it's one of the most important issues for us to get our country back
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:39.160]  on track is to solve this better reserve mess we need to get rid of it and we
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:42.680]  need to institute sound money yeah without a question
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:46.520]  as gold and silver in my opinion are a good way to go and we can have a
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:51.480]  debate about where to go with money and i was listening to your interview the
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:55.960]  other day with uh it isn't peter joseph from zeitgeist
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:50:01.160]  yeah that was years ago oh was it yeah and i mean i don't think that we need to
[02:50:01.160 --> 02:50:06.120]  get rid of money it is argument about if we get you know the scarcity thing
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:10.440]  his argument is to have a global computer that decides everything and
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:15.640]  it is absolute dehumanization but it's always packaged uh that's what the
[02:50:15.640 --> 02:50:19.480]  collectivist always do is they package uh things as total
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:22.840]  liberation but what it brings is total enslavement
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:27.080]  that's why you have the new york times doing positive glowing reviews of him
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:30.360]  uh while separately saying i'm violent need to be arrested
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:33.880]  uh the the system gives that their seal of approval and uh
[02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:37.880]  goes into convulsions of fear dealing with me let's come back and talk more
[02:50:37.880 --> 02:50:41.400]  about yeah let's come back and talk more about
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:45.960]  your research and what it found with our guest alex newman from the new american

[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:10.200]  think again benzene a toxic gas emitted from crude oil
[02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:14.440]  and a known carcinogen is now airborne traveling hundreds even thousands of
[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:17.080]  miles inland whether you lived near the gulf or not
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:20.840]  benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to

[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:32.360]  the prison planet dot com article and it is one of the stories on the drudge

[02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:42.840]  times article epidemic growth of net porn cited briefing
[02:54:42.840 --> 02:54:48.200]  children in danger but when you actually read the national security strategy
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:55.400]  may two thousand and ten it echoes what cast sunstein and others have said
[02:54:55.400 --> 02:55:00.600]  its criticism of the government is effective and is discrediting the
[02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:04.680]  state the state is
[02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:09.400]  a structure owned by foreign hedge funds mainly
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:14.600]  i was reading the latest issue of vanity fair about one of the heads of the
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:17.640]  hedge funds is made over ten billion dollars
[02:55:17.640 --> 02:55:21.560]  just the last few years himself personally
[02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:26.040]  and they admitted what he's doing is illegal but said how great it was he
[02:55:26.040 --> 02:55:29.560]  was basically doing it and how fun it was and
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:33.960]  how it's all insider trading haha
[02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:40.760]  so a few hundred guys can have tens of billions in the bank
[02:55:40.760 --> 02:55:44.760]  we're gonna let them destroy our entire economy put us all in debt
[02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:47.720]  and then hire a bunch of paramilitary brainwash police
[02:55:47.720 --> 02:55:52.440]  to oppress us i mean that's the new world order
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:57.160]  just criminals looting everything and they've got their people in all the
[02:55:57.160 --> 02:56:00.680]  regulatory positions and so that's the end of it just accept it
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:05.560]  no i'm not going to accept it alex neumann you know the good news is
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:10.760]  30 plus years of people trying to audit the fed almost 30 a ron paul and his
[02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:14.600]  two different visits to congress when he was in there um
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:17.720]  and then got kicked out and then went back in the mid 90s
[02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:21.320]  you know he he almost had no cosponsors now he's
[02:56:21.320 --> 02:56:24.360]  got a lot of cosponsors he got it passed out of the house
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:29.560]  it's uh in the senate got derailed but the the system knows is the big to
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.120]  brazinski said a month ago that the people are now really awake
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:37.640]  to their structure and it's only a matter of time
[02:56:37.640 --> 02:56:42.440]  until they try to remove these parasites
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:46.040]  but the parasites are planning to maintain their control
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:53.000]  at a barrel of the of a gun yeah and like you said what's going on now in
[02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:56.440]  congress i think it's fascinating that we really have an opportunity right now
[02:56:56.440 --> 02:57:00.200]  people are so upset and knowledge about this
[02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:03.560]  i think it's i think a criminal syndicate is a good way to put it this
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:06.600]  better reserve people are really starting to understand
[02:57:06.600 --> 02:57:09.480]  it's a bipartisan issue now some of the fiercest
[02:57:09.480 --> 02:57:13.000]  critics of the fed have actually come from the democrat democratic party like
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  alan greyson in florida and i disagree with his view of
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:20.920]  how government should run and what its purpose should be but he he's done such
[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:24.680]  a good job of hammering on the fed and it just goes to show you that this is
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:28.360]  this isn't a partisan issue in any way this is an issue that should concern
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:32.600]  every american and every american who isn't on the dole of the big banks
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:35.560]  or the government should should be really concerned about this
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:39.320]  and you know polls are showing that 80 percent of the people now want the fed
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:43.240]  audited so now is really in our opportunity in america to
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:47.160]  to fix this problem to get rid of this you call in parasites and i think it's a
[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.720]  perfect description they're they're leaching off of the american people's
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:54.920]  labor and they're not contributing anything they're
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:00.280]  bankrupting us they create bubbles and this pyramid scheme it literally when
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:03.480]  it collapses it it it leaves them in control of
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:07.480]  everything plus interest which we can we can't ever pay back
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:11.320]  so i'm excited about the momentum now the the fed is being attacked from so many
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.160]  different angles of course they hired a lobbyist not to go to
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:18.920]  capital hill and protect their interests but but you know the american people
[02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:21.880]  are catching on now that lobbyists are not i think
[02:58:21.880 --> 02:58:25.800]  the the fed days are numbered here because as people realize
[02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:29.560]  what's going on and they can't keep it hidden anymore this this last economic
[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:33.640]  crisis really put it all out in the open congress has caught on to the scheme
[02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:37.000]  now and you know we don't have enough senators yet to get a proper
[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:41.800]  audit of the fed but we're gonna get it well said alex newman great job

[02:58:54.520 --> 02:58:58.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:02.280]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:05.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:59:05.880 --> 02:59:10.120]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:13.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:15.960]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:59:15.960 --> 02:59:19.880]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:23.400]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:26.520]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:29.640]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:29.640 --> 02:59:33.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar
[02:59:33.400 --> 02:59:37.080]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:48.680]  gotten into chris mathews i've mentioned it some of the big hit piece

[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:55.800]  and in the last few nights he's been foreshadowing
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:00:59.480]  you know that i'm this dangerous radical who's endangering everybody
[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:03.400]  so that's coming up right now let's go to ruben in connecticut
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:05.880]  ruben thanks for holding you're the best welcome
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:10.920]  hey thank you alex uh this uh long time listener for some color okay
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:16.520]  uh i was wondering if you guys have heard of aerogel or solid smoke
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:20.440]  which will be a perfect solution for the oil spill over there in the Gulf of
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:24.600]  Mexico if you go to youtube and type uh
[03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:32.520]  aerogel solution to gulf oil slick and have a video there of a guy showing how
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:37.160]  how aerogel folks up all the oil leaving the water intact
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.240]  it's an expensive solution but it's something well the other big thing is if
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:47.080]  you have 50 60 million gallons or more pouring
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.160]  in what factory can make or deliver
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.640]  60 million gallons of the aerogel i am familiar with a lot of the different
[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:58.680]  solutions they have i'm glad kevin costner systems
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:02.360]  the centrifuge has just got bought the bigger issue is
[03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:05.880]  within a year almost all of that oil is going to biodegrade
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:09.320]  i mean i can't tell you how many tar balls i've seen the texas coast
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:13.480]  with just all sorts of life living on it
[03:02:13.480 --> 03:02:17.640]  the bacteria eat it now it's terrible when it comes into your estuaries and
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:20.440]  kills your fisheries they should have blocked those
[03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:23.240]  up day one but the feds wouldn't let the states do it
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:26.920]  why were the feds doing that why do the feds
[03:02:26.920 --> 03:02:32.040]  want to exacerbate the crisis ribbon what do you think's going on
[03:02:32.040 --> 03:02:36.040]  well i think like you've mentioned before they're they're gonna take advantage
[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:41.080]  of any crisis that happens any catastrophe they're gonna take advantage
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:45.400]  of it and it's a sad thing it's a sad thing
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.480]  alex and i'm just hoping for the best you know i just threw out my two cents
[03:02:49.480 --> 03:02:52.840]  there you know people can check it out you know
[03:02:52.840 --> 03:02:56.280]  it's a guy on youtube that you know they manufacture all the
[03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:00.680]  air gel and it shows a good video and i think
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:03.720]  you know if you go if people get the word out
[03:03:03.720 --> 03:03:07.400]  maybe i hear you i hear you ribbon and i appreciate your call and i think the
[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:12.840]  oil spill serious but overall it's a distraction
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:16.680]  it's a distraction it's something that happens every day it's a soap opera
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:21.720]  oh why won't obama fix it don't worry he's got a tax on you that'll fix it
[03:03:21.720 --> 03:03:26.600]  but Lieberman says it's only a dollar a day
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:29.960]  per family just a dollar more and of course there's a lot more than that
[03:03:29.960 --> 03:03:33.880]  the power to taxes the power to destroy let's talk to mike and ohio
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:37.720]  mike here on the air hey thanks for taking my call the reason for my call
[03:03:37.720 --> 03:03:41.080]  today is i heard on youtube before the interview before
[03:03:41.080 --> 03:03:46.360]  lindsay williams did with george norrie last week he did an interview and he
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:50.920]  about gave some key information i've got high level sources that told me the
[03:03:50.920 --> 03:03:53.160]  same thing as what he was about to give up
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:57.720]  he said george your listeners would be amazed on who controls the military
[03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:02.200]  about gave it up i want to tell out to everybody in the listening audience
[03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:06.520]  that the federal reserve has taken full control of our military
[03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:09.960]  and our foreign policy it's already done obama has no
[03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:14.040]  saying it lindsay if you got if you get lindsay on again
[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:17.880]  please get him to answer that question he will he will verify what i say you
[03:04:17.880 --> 03:04:21.400]  know that's a good idea let's get an update from lindsay tomorrow or
[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:25.720]  friday let's set him up in the third or fourth
[03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:30.120]  hour again so people can call in and ask him questions we'll get him on
[03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:35.960]  we'll ask him that question but i've seen the head of the war college the

[03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:07.240]  great day to y'all boy this is uh something i've
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:11.080]  i've hearing you say something each time that i think is
[03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:15.240]  very important and i've really been uh trying to do it myself
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:19.160]  and that is not get distracted from from all the
[03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:22.440]  craziness that these people do i'm starting to just learn as i read
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:26.120]  the bible through that hebrews nine and other things that these people are just
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:30.360]  crazy and i'm learning what can i do and just stay focused on that and
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:33.080]  and i'm wondering what other people may be getting out of you know getting
[03:09:33.080 --> 03:09:36.120]  response out of you know just staying focused on like that fellow there he
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:39.800]  was great boy that guy alex man he really just like you you know i mean
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:42.600]  that was that was amazing stuff i'm kind of stuttering a little bit i know mark
[03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:46.040]  god bless you it's good to hear from you we've got to stay focused but we've
[03:09:46.040 --> 03:09:48.840]  got to decide what are the most important issues then
[03:09:48.840 --> 03:09:52.520]  and i'm sorry it's not the oil spill yes it's destroying some of the
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:55.400]  shrimpers lives yes it's hurting the gulf coast
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:10:00.040]  but compared to trillions a month being stolen by offshore banks
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:03.000]  that are destroying our bill of rights and constitution
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:08.120]  liberty is the engine of our freedom we'll bounce back from this oil spill
[03:10:08.120 --> 03:10:12.840]  if the government lets us bounce back if they hold bp accountable
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:16.120]  but i'm here to tell you bp has bought and paid for obama
[03:10:16.120 --> 03:10:20.360]  it's one of his chief contributors and when he says he's going to make them pay
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:23.880]  you watch they're gonna end up paying a paltry sum and they're going to make a
[03:10:23.880 --> 03:10:28.120]  lot more money on the carbon tax that they are progenitors of
[03:10:28.120 --> 03:10:33.080]  they are the main kingpins along with
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:39.080]  ken lay's company in ron that cooked this up in the 80s and 90s
[03:10:39.080 --> 03:10:42.520]  and their carbon tax situation that they've invested tens of billions of
[03:10:42.520 --> 03:10:46.280]  pushing in was in deep trouble and now this comes along
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:50.360]  and obama's trying to ram it through using the crisis and you've got bp and
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:54.280]  goldman sacks and the and the bp executive dumping their stock
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:58.040]  in the week before the spill and then obama not letting people clean it up it
[03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:01.240]  is very suspicious let's talk to george in
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:03.560]  connecticut georgia on the air
[03:11:03.560 --> 03:11:07.560]  hi alex i'm glad to talk to the truth network instead of the liars of
[03:11:07.560 --> 03:11:11.400]  this world um i wanted to make a quick suggestion since we're in another shock
[03:11:11.400 --> 03:11:14.440]  doctrine why don't we get Naomi Klein on so she can breathe
[03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:19.640]  uh evaluate how this uh might fit into the the categories plus all the liberals
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:21.720]  out there don't want to believe this stuff
[03:11:21.720 --> 03:11:24.680]  they can basically hear it from the from the horse's mouth
[03:11:24.680 --> 03:11:28.040]  and also gorge doll because he gets on this stuff a lot
[03:11:28.040 --> 03:11:32.280]  so that the liberals can no longer say oh well this is a right-wing conspiracy
[03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:35.560]  nonsense and one last thing i wanted to say is
[03:11:35.560 --> 03:11:39.160]  john uh john lear i saw i came across a
[03:11:39.160 --> 03:11:42.360]  online thing that was under john lear tells all about
[03:11:42.360 --> 03:11:48.760]  uh uh tells all part 12 which he explains who exactly created the age
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:53.560]  virus uh which is a dr donner for a uh i guess a
[03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:58.920]  division of the the navy s4 and he explains how it can be cured through
[03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:03.720]  some sort of uh chinese uh uh virus not virus but the
[03:12:03.720 --> 03:12:07.640]  something on a plant that can be used to to kill the virus
[03:12:07.640 --> 03:12:11.160]  so he had the documents in hand so here we have things to show
[03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:14.680]  they're trying to kill us and kill certain segments of society
[03:12:14.680 --> 03:12:17.880]  i'll leave the rest to you all right i appreciate the call
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:21.320]  let's talk to steven and florida you're on the air
[03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:27.000]  yeah hey alex uh two quick things on the gulf and macris mathews first of all
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:31.320]  far as i'm concerned the gulf situation and you've pointed out it's got inside
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:34.920]  job written all over it uh the fact that the feds won't allow the
[03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:38.120]  states to do what they want to do these companies that have the
[03:12:38.120 --> 03:12:41.880]  microbes to eat the oil and the others with the skimming technology now they
[03:12:41.880 --> 03:12:45.720]  have troops uh working with bp you know the whole
[03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:49.560]  thing it's about the carbon tax that's absolutely certain so
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:53.960]  that's my take on that well we knew was coming i mean what does a carbon tax
[03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:58.840]  and taxes on oil and gasoline how does taxing something get us off our
[03:12:58.840 --> 03:13:02.600]  dependence or not letting us drill in the us get us off our
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:05.480]  dependence or not letting us have the the safe
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:11.080]  overland pipelines from alaska uh which has more oil than saudi arabia
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:15.400]  they this is a monopoly they won't let us have our oil
[03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:18.200]  and so they're saying you want something to be done about the oil spill
[03:13:18.200 --> 03:13:24.520]  we'll just give you a carbon tax paid to bp how's that sound to you i mean bp
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:28.520]  owns large portions of the chicago carbon exchange
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:33.480]  uh the gore and blood carbon exchange with with al gore
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:37.080]  uh blood and gore no pun intended mr
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:41.640]  mr blood is the partner i mean they stand to gain from this we've got
[03:13:41.640 --> 03:13:47.400]  to kill this carbon tax and so it's about rewarding the criminal
[03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:50.600]  cartel that alex was just talking about that's what the whole thing make enough
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:53.080]  for slaves uh the other thing is you mentioned
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:56.200]  earlier with this hit piece by matthew that's airing tonight
[03:13:56.200 --> 03:14:00.200]  and then he says alex jones thinks that and of course his implication is you
[03:14:00.200 --> 03:14:02.680]  don't know what you're talking about but if you think about it alex that's
[03:14:02.680 --> 03:14:05.800]  double speed because actually that's what it is alex
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:09.720]  jones thinks he thinks critically based on the factual
[03:14:09.720 --> 03:14:13.640]  information that makes his conclusions basic and they don't want you and the
[03:14:13.640 --> 03:14:17.480]  rest of us to think they want us to all be the dumb down sheeple
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:23.000]  and just go blindly long and not think so yes you do think he's right about that
[03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:26.760]  god bless you steve i appreciate your call i'll get to david kevin kirk and
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:30.280]  others um towards the end of the hour if we have
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:34.680]  time but i've got to get to this news now
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:41.000]  it's coming to a crescendo we've had the southern property loss center within
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:46.280]  hours of richard ploskey in pennsylvania killing three cops
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:50.440]  saying that basically i told him to do it and then he was my fan
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:53.480]  we went and searched his name and found out he was attacking me
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:56.600]  he hated me because i don't get into racial issues
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:03.320]  and because i didn't hate jews on major nazi websites
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:07.320]  and then other newspapers picked it up and i did force a retraction with
[03:15:07.320 --> 03:15:11.720]  threats of lawsuits in five newspapers
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:15.960]  but since then a year and a half ago hundreds of news articles there were
[03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:21.960]  three or four today i saw say that i'm calling for violence
[03:15:21.960 --> 03:15:28.280]  and that i'm going to cause people to kill cops and that what i'm saying is
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:32.200]  going to cause violence when i speak out against violence and say
[03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:35.640]  that we're winning peacefully hearts and minds and that the
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:39.720]  establishment is going to stage terror attacks to be blamed on
[03:15:39.720 --> 03:15:44.360]  libertarians conservatives patriots people that are anti new world order
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:49.320]  anti war activist on the left in that control paradigm
[03:15:49.320 --> 03:15:52.520]  and we have the internal government documents that show this we have the
[03:15:52.520 --> 03:15:57.400]  internal government documents that show that they are scared of what we the
[03:15:57.400 --> 03:16:02.520]  people are doing and so i a week or so ago i got
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:07.160]  the transcript of the television program is going to air three times
[03:16:07.160 --> 03:16:10.680]  tonight and remember chris mathews is a joke he has
[03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:14.600]  about a half a million viewers that's the little leagues of cable tv
[03:16:14.600 --> 03:16:18.280]  blend backs the big leagues three million to four million
[03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:21.160]  and that's still not that big of an audience rush limbaugh's got 10 million
[03:16:21.160 --> 03:16:24.440]  a day coast to coast a m about eight million a day
[03:16:24.440 --> 03:16:30.920]  over 30 million uh to 35 million plus mostly limbaugh is 22 million a week
[03:16:30.920 --> 03:16:34.840]  coast to coast 16 million a week uh michael savage 10 million a week
[03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:40.360]  sean hannity 10 million or so a week i mean glenn back 14 million a week
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:45.160]  that gives you an idea talk radio is much bigger than cable tv it's just cable
[03:16:45.160 --> 03:16:49.400]  tv has got 400 500 channels talk radio does it
[03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:52.920]  what do you have two three choices in your channel talk radio if it's a big big
[03:16:52.920 --> 03:16:57.480]  city maybe five six choices most of that sports my point is is that
[03:16:57.480 --> 03:17:04.840]  chris mathews is a legend in his own mind this is really an exercise in
[03:17:04.840 --> 03:17:07.960]  being even noticed even being in the game
[03:17:07.960 --> 03:17:17.000]  at any level that's why chris mathews and msnbc are constantly
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.120]  demonizing anybody who's against government corruption
[03:17:20.120 --> 03:17:22.920]  that's why if you don't want the government running your health care
[03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:25.960]  and the insurance companies writing the legislation to rip you off
[03:17:25.960 --> 03:17:30.440]  you are a racist now to even a five-year-old
[03:17:30.440 --> 03:17:33.640]  you say i don't want government running my health care and they say you're a
[03:17:33.640 --> 03:17:37.880]  racist that's code word for the n word that's a quote
[03:17:37.880 --> 03:17:42.120]  anyone with common sense says that's ridiculous the only way
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:44.600]  that
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:53.000]  chris mathews can be relevant in any way is to make outrageous statements
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:57.000]  is to say if you don't like big government you're a racist
[03:17:57.000 --> 03:18:01.080]  if you believe there's a population control agenda which is admitted by the
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:03.800]  way we have a big article today detailing it
[03:18:03.800 --> 03:18:08.440]  you want to kill cops and the piece coming up tonight according to the
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:12.200]  script says you know jones isn't probably going to be
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:17.720]  out pulling triggers on cops but his followers certainly are
[03:18:17.720 --> 03:18:21.480]  so a half million people probably more because they've been hyping this for a
[03:18:21.480 --> 03:18:25.160]  few weeks are going to watch this and it still has that
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:29.400]  authority though of a guy in a suit with fancy teleprompters and a fancy
[03:18:29.400 --> 03:18:34.040]  set saying alex jones wants to kill cops
[03:18:34.040 --> 03:18:37.880]  and last night the night before he said similar things
[03:18:37.880 --> 03:18:44.040]  about how we're going to cause violence uh on his hardball show and so when we
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:47.800]  come back from break i'm going to play part of this exchange and then i'm
[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:53.000]  going to come back and play a clip of one of their other talk show host
[03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:57.560]  calling for basically obama to be a dictator and i saw the comments on the
[03:18:57.560 --> 03:19:02.840]  youtube saying yeah we need a dictator to clean this up
[03:19:02.840 --> 03:19:06.360]  a dictatorship is going to give us freedom
[03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:12.520]  a dictatorship is what it takes to fix america
[03:19:12.520 --> 03:19:18.440]  and in that human trait that mob psychology trait you see the real
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:23.240]  danger obama is dangerous and they they test ballooned him
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:26.680]  as a messiah as a savior to bring in tyranny
[03:19:26.680 --> 03:19:30.600]  but that cult of personality got shot down very quickly because
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:36.360]  people wanted instant gratification the real danger is the next savior
[03:19:36.360 --> 03:19:39.720]  they're going to bring into office after mr obama leaves the next two and a half
[03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:43.320]  years i predict he may still stage a terror attack and try to stay in
[03:19:43.320 --> 03:19:46.440]  anything's possible in world war three with iran he may end up being like
[03:19:46.440 --> 03:19:51.080]  roosevelt four or five tours who knows
[03:19:51.080 --> 03:19:55.240]  the point is the danger here is they're going to really start promoting
[03:19:55.240 --> 03:19:58.040]  dictatorship and i'm seeing this more and more
[03:19:58.040 --> 03:20:02.840]  uh if we just had a dictator they could fix it all
[03:20:02.840 --> 03:20:06.440]  hello this is alex jones with some important questions if you're going

[03:24:32.520 --> 03:24:38.600]  tea parties birthers patriot groups malicious
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:42.840]  their common cause a raging hostility toward the elected government
[03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:46.440]  of the united states and we are in deep tyranny
[03:24:46.440 --> 03:24:51.320]  deep deep deep their common fear that their personal
[03:24:51.320 --> 03:24:56.360]  rights and freedoms stand in imminent jeopardy
[03:24:56.360 --> 03:24:59.560]  tyranny is something that we've been warned from the very beginning by the
[03:24:59.560 --> 03:25:02.280]  founding fathers that you have to be on guard against
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:05.720]  their common enemy the president of the united states
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:09.400]  iraq obama we're either going to stop him
[03:25:09.400 --> 03:25:13.080]  or the united states of america is going to cease to exist
[03:25:13.080 --> 03:25:16.680]  from right of center to the farthest range they resent what they see america
[03:25:16.680 --> 03:25:20.040]  becoming tens of millions are ready to vote no
[03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:23.640]  to everything the new president proposes but for others
[03:25:23.640 --> 03:25:27.480]  the fight is bigger than bills in congress or election candidates
[03:25:27.480 --> 03:25:31.720]  in their own words they want to take their country back
[03:25:31.720 --> 03:25:34.760]  david corins washington bureau chief for mother joe's magazine and writes the
[03:25:34.760 --> 03:25:38.360]  politics calm dot com he writes for politics daily dot com
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:43.000]  pat pecan is of course pat pecan and you're one of the stars of this not
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:46.040]  because you're a current hero but because you were a pathfinder
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:50.360]  what i find stunning about this and i think liberals progressives people from
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:53.480]  the center left will be stunned and scared by what they see tomorrow night
[03:25:53.480 --> 03:25:57.080]  people in the right may find themselves yelling right on right on because a lot
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:01.080]  of this documentary is simply people on the right saying their thing from glen
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:05.080]  back to rush limbaugh to orally tates to all these people out there alex
[03:26:05.080 --> 03:26:08.680]  jones saying their thing it's a true documentary as you know
[03:26:08.680 --> 03:26:13.480]  what is it today that scares people about washington government to the point
[03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:16.360]  where some are arming themselves they're calling it illegitimate this
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:19.800]  government was elected legitimately uh... they're calling it a tyranny
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:23.640]  it's not right left anymore it sounds revolutionary these people all of them
[03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:28.200]  tea party militia and patriot groups truth
[03:26:28.200 --> 03:26:33.160]  now back up a few seconds um we're not saying that it's illegitimate because
[03:26:33.160 --> 03:26:36.600]  it wasn't elected we're saying it's illegitimate for the
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:40.440]  government to take over one-seventh of the economy
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.600]  and for to be written by the insurance companies to cut
[03:26:44.600 --> 03:26:49.560]  benefits and raise taxes we're saying it's illegitimate
[03:26:49.560 --> 03:26:54.120]  that obama's real name is buried sataro and he is an indonesian citizen
[03:26:54.120 --> 03:26:57.880]  and in an ineligible to be president
[03:26:57.880 --> 03:27:01.720]  not just being born in kenya the evidence all points towards that
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:05.720]  but it's a hundred percent he's a kenyan
[03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:08.840]  communist supporter and he supported
[03:27:08.840 --> 03:27:13.080]  odinga his cousin the muslim extremist who murdered a bunch of christians
[03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:16.840]  and that obama was involved supporting that and advising him how to do it
[03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:23.560]  and that he is a indonesian citizen but it's not just about obama
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:27.080]  the original tea parties were ron paul supporters sick of the wars
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:30.920]  sick of bush tripling government
[03:27:30.920 --> 03:27:34.280]  all these idiot obama supporters thought they were going to get free cars free
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:36.600]  houses free everything remember all that
[03:27:36.600 --> 03:27:40.040]  year and a half later they don't think that anymore obama's got a very low
[03:27:40.040 --> 03:27:44.360]  approval rating what are 60 of the american people
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:49.960]  that hate his guts are they terrorist obama is a puppet obama is a front man
[03:27:49.960 --> 03:27:53.000]  obama doesn't matter at the end of the day
[03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:57.720]  see they want to make this about left right they want to make this about obama
[03:27:57.720 --> 03:28:02.120]  none of what i told matthews people about serious issues is in the film
[03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:05.640]  everything's taken out of context like my quote
[03:28:05.640 --> 03:28:08.920]  and i gave their interviewee the documents the quotes
[03:28:08.920 --> 03:28:12.360]  about reducing our population between 80 and 90 percent
[03:28:12.360 --> 03:28:16.920]  and i went on to say some of their people say get rid of all humans
[03:28:16.920 --> 03:28:21.160]  some say get rid of 99 percent this is all on record this is in the news every
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:25.880]  day people calling for this this is what the globalist want
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:29.480]  this is what their new world orders in game is
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:33.880]  but let's let's finish up continue tates to all these people out there alex
[03:28:33.880 --> 03:28:37.480]  jones saying their thing it's a true documentary as you know
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:42.200]  what is it today that scares people about washington government to the point
[03:28:42.200 --> 03:28:45.080]  where some are arming themselves they're calling it illegitimate this
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:48.200]  government was elected legitimately uh they're calling it a tyranny it's
[03:28:48.200 --> 03:28:51.800]  engaged in treason anymore it sounds revolutionary these people
[03:28:51.800 --> 03:28:55.640]  all of them tea party if it's unconstitutional it's illegal
[03:28:55.640 --> 03:28:59.480]  truth uh birthers the whole isn't you don't get bankers mix in an awful lot of
[03:28:59.480 --> 03:29:02.840]  things well because they use the same language well they do but look look i
[03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:06.680]  mean i don't know these michigan militia guys i don't go out with them with them
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:10.120]  into the woods and things like that and i don't know if these guys with guns and
[03:29:10.120 --> 03:29:13.480]  things like that really represent a tea party which you gotta ask chris is
[03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:17.640]  how is it that a tea party that you describe in a one-hour documentary
[03:29:17.640 --> 03:29:21.800]  is very dangerous and in some ways threatening had a two-to-one approval
[03:29:21.800 --> 03:29:24.120]  record and the tea party was more admired and
[03:29:24.120 --> 03:29:27.880]  improving of than the democratic party and the republican party as of a couple
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:31.400]  of months ago where you've got it pretty close i think chris is the second
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:34.040]  part i think the first part would be like me doing a
[03:29:34.040 --> 03:29:37.640]  documentary on the civil rights movement and starting off with stokely car

[03:33:05.720 --> 03:33:11.240]  pat buchanan made the central point that they've had polls were as high as
[03:33:11.240 --> 03:33:17.160]  84 percent have more favorable comments about the
[03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:21.160]  tea party when asked versus 40 roughly supporting
[03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:27.640]  obama so two to one you've got a network like msnbc
[03:33:27.640 --> 03:33:32.120]  with its top shows with half a million viewers
[03:33:32.120 --> 03:33:36.600]  cnn just three years ago had three million viewers for larry king live now
[03:33:36.600 --> 03:33:39.720]  it's got a million their number one show has a million
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:43.160]  viewers no one is watching these people
[03:33:43.160 --> 03:33:48.200]  not only because they're tuning away from tv to the internet
[03:33:48.200 --> 03:33:53.080]  because they can get more depth and breadth of discussion and ideas
[03:33:53.080 --> 03:33:56.520]  and get off the phony left-right paradigm plantation
[03:33:56.520 --> 03:34:00.120]  but because they know these people have an agenda
[03:34:00.120 --> 03:34:03.960]  now paul watson wrote an article and pointed out
[03:34:03.960 --> 03:34:07.880]  that chris matthews has defended domestic terrorist
[03:34:07.880 --> 03:34:12.040]  while smearing americans as dangerous radicals
[03:34:12.040 --> 03:34:15.800]  matthews on video has said that he likes linen
[03:34:15.800 --> 03:34:20.120]  he likes saul elinsky he likes communism
[03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:24.280]  but then the tea party's hold up signs saying we don't want communism
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:29.240]  and he calls them nuts see that's how arrogant somebody like chris mathews is
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:33.000]  is he makes millions of dollars a year or is it three four million a year
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:36.920]  he sits up there he works for the big banks he wants to communalize your
[03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:40.760]  wealth so he can control it and then he tells you it
[03:34:40.760 --> 03:34:44.360]  doesn't exist and you're crazy that's why he has a half million viewers
[03:34:44.360 --> 03:34:47.400]  and so that's why he's got to air this three times today
[03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:51.880]  twice tomorrow and one time again every day for the next two weeks
[03:34:51.880 --> 03:34:55.800]  is what they're scheduling just just just just airing it constantly over and
[03:34:55.800 --> 03:34:59.560]  over again hoping they have an effect hoping if they sling
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:02.680]  enough mud up against the wall that it has some type of effect
[03:35:02.680 --> 03:35:05.880]  while chris mathews sits up there and says i control reality
[03:35:05.880 --> 03:35:09.240]  i tell you what's safe to watch i tell you what's safe to see
[03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:12.840]  and in that video clip last night he's like this is going to scare a lot of
[03:35:12.840 --> 03:35:16.520]  progressives this is going to scare a lot of main line
[03:35:16.520 --> 03:35:21.720]  liberals oh it's so scary these people want to overthrow the government
[03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:25.080]  chris mathews knows it's a foreign corporate takeover of the u.s.
[03:35:25.080 --> 03:35:30.040]  he worked for a u.s president he knows there's eugenics going on so does pat
[03:35:30.040 --> 03:35:33.400]  Buchanan he knows all of this is real now now
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:37.000]  now here's the key clip they say this alex jones
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:42.680]  is being legitimized by rand paul that's not really what they're worried about
[03:35:42.680 --> 03:35:46.680]  they're worried about my message becoming mainstream
[03:35:46.680 --> 03:35:51.000]  and they know that if people start talking about poison in the water
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:54.040]  and if people start talking about brainwashing on television that if
[03:35:54.040 --> 03:35:57.640]  people start talking about gmo food sterilizing them and if people start
[03:35:57.640 --> 03:36:02.200]  talking about world government and real issues that are there
[03:36:02.200 --> 03:36:06.520]  it's game over no one's going to care anymore hearing how scary the militia
[03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:09.480]  is and the federal judge has ordered their release
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:14.120]  it was all fake no one is going to because they're going to know
[03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:19.080]  the real killers the real control freaks are the people running our government
[03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:23.960]  this is a group of criminals to the max let's finish up with this clip
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:27.800]  i think you're mixing an awful lot of things because they use the same
[03:36:27.800 --> 03:36:30.200]  language well they do but look look i mean i don't know
[03:36:30.200 --> 03:36:33.960]  these michigan militia guys i don't go out with them with them into the woods
[03:36:33.960 --> 03:36:37.240]  and things like that and i don't know if these guys with guns and things like
[03:36:37.240 --> 03:36:40.360]  that really represent a tea party which you gotta ask christie pause again how
[03:36:40.360 --> 03:36:44.840]  is it that you see they're scared they want to be the government with the
[03:36:44.840 --> 03:36:47.240]  guns they want to be the government with men in black scheme ask
[03:36:47.240 --> 03:36:49.640]  they want to be the government face scanning you and making you have an
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:53.160]  idea to have a job but illegals are exempt they want to be the ones with all
[03:36:53.160 --> 03:36:57.080]  the force the monopoly of force it scares them the true americana
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:37:01.480]  of americans buying guns and training with it it it scares them that 20 plus
[03:37:01.480 --> 03:37:03.720]  million guns have been sold the last year and a half
[03:37:03.720 --> 03:37:07.640]  breaking all records it scares them that people are getting real
[03:37:07.640 --> 03:37:10.920]  and are not caring about the political correctness
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:15.240]  of basically wetting themselves every time christ matthew shows them a gun
[03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:17.640]  and i won't have time to play the whole piece but at the end of the eight minute
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.240]  piece christ matthew says they've got guns they're wearing guns
[03:37:23.240 --> 03:37:27.800]  well yeah how can they ban all guns if people start wearing guns everywhere
[03:37:27.800 --> 03:37:31.240]  then all the sheep go i thought guns are illegal you know the average sheep in
[03:37:31.240 --> 03:37:35.320]  austin texas i talked to the middle of texas they believe guns are illegal
[03:37:35.320 --> 03:37:38.360]  if they come to your house to clean your carpet or fix your toilet
[03:37:38.360 --> 03:37:42.200]  and they're not from texas i mean it's happened to me and they see
[03:37:42.200 --> 03:37:47.240]  a gun case they begin living in fear just like that christ matthew's
[03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:51.880]  uh reporter the producer of the show that came down here to interview me
[03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:56.680]  she saw a gun on the shelf over here and got and literally couldn't breathe and
[03:37:56.680 --> 03:38:00.200]  was hyperventilating started crying and i thought something was wrong with her
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:04.440]  because she couldn't talk for about 60 seconds it was
[03:38:07.160 --> 03:38:09.960]  and literally was in such terror she couldn't breathe and i was like what's
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:12.280]  wrong i put my hands on her what's wrong
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:18.040]  what's wrong i'm sorry
[03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:27.720]  and again she feels safe when she sees a guy in a swat team with a gun or a
[03:38:27.720 --> 03:38:32.200]  femacamp or you know checkpoints or body scanner she's like oh
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:35.480]  the government hurting us and lining us up and checking our papers that's
[03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:40.760]  freedom but she sees a slave with a gun
[03:38:40.760 --> 03:38:44.680]  and she goes into convulsions of fear her religion
[03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:48.120]  is being disarmed and weak and so these cloistered
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:52.360]  little elitist they have taught people to have a psychological
[03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:58.760]  revulsion of women that are women cars that are cars men that are men
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:03.480]  just red blooded americana everything that flag really symbolizes
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:09.160]  private property constitution real capitalism not crony capitalism they
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:12.200]  hate it
[03:39:12.200 --> 03:39:17.480]  they hate it they absolutely hate it because these are because if they were
[03:39:17.480 --> 03:39:21.240]  real world people they wouldn't be for tyranny
[03:39:21.240 --> 03:39:25.560]  go ahead and finish the club the party that you described in a one-hour
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:29.400]  documentary as very dangerous and in some ways threatening
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:33.080]  had a two-to-one approval record and the tea party was more admired and
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:35.960]  approving of than the democratic party and the republican
[03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:39.560]  party as of a couple of months ago where you've got it pretty close i think
[03:39:39.560 --> 03:39:43.000]  christ is the second part i think the first part would be like me doing a
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:46.360]  documentary on the civil rights movement and starting off with stokely
[03:39:46.360 --> 03:39:50.600]  car michael and h-rap brown and you know malcolm x and eladji
[03:39:50.600 --> 03:39:54.360]  muhammad and then you get around to whitney young and then yeah but more
[03:39:54.360 --> 03:39:57.400]  than a king was never a black nationalist he wasn't calling for
[03:39:57.400 --> 03:40:00.920]  separation let me go to eat david it seems to be what strikes me and doing
[03:40:00.920 --> 03:40:05.160]  this is the use look at that sign right there back
[03:40:05.160 --> 03:40:09.160]  it up about a second please for people watching on prisonplanet.tv it says
[03:40:09.160 --> 03:40:13.880]  vote out all incumbents crooks you've got every
[03:40:13.880 --> 03:40:18.360]  incumbent in every race whether it's florida
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:23.880]  kentucky pennsylvania hawaii colorada republican and democrat being voted out
[03:40:23.880 --> 03:40:27.240]  that's never happened before it's always one party's out of favor one party's
[03:40:27.240 --> 03:40:30.120]  in favor that's what they're panicked by
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:33.400]  you go to a tea party most the signs are both parties are bad
[03:40:33.400 --> 03:40:36.680]  we're bankrupt you know cut the size of government
[03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:40.520]  and that's why they hate the tea party so much because at its roots
[03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:44.360]  it's bipartisan at its roots it's transpartisan
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:47.400]  and so first they want to make it a republican issues they can divide and
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:50.680]  conquer then they want to radicalize it and demonize it
[03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:55.800]  and they want to be gatekeepers and say look this alex jones is too popular
[03:40:55.800 --> 03:40:59.720]  he's a kook he says the government wants to reduce your numbers
[03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:04.680]  when that is the stated state department u.s policy stated u.n policy
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:09.400]  and the stated white house science are who has written
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:13.080]  more than 10 books and booklets we own them all
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:16.760]  and here's the textbook he wrote eco science where it calls for drugging the
[03:41:16.760 --> 03:41:20.200]  water to sterilize you and calls for a planetary regime to do it
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:24.040]  and calls for uh you know basically forced abortion
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:27.480]  i mean i mean this is the white house science are this is they say we want a
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:30.760]  planetary government to then carry this out
[03:41:30.760 --> 03:41:36.680]  i mean look chris mathews is a dead political duck
[03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:41.160]  he wants to make this violent because he's losing the political fight
[03:41:41.160 --> 03:41:44.920]  and just like they told you the vaccines wouldn't hurt you and i said folks
[03:41:44.920 --> 03:41:49.640]  don't believe me don't believe mathews don't believe fox news they were up
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:52.360]  their line too and singing in i said go to the
[03:41:52.360 --> 03:41:57.640]  Walgreens go to the cvs go to the savans or vans or whatever it is
[03:41:57.640 --> 03:42:02.040]  or the ecord go to the pharmacy and say i want the insert
[03:42:02.040 --> 03:42:07.880]  that came with the shot bottle and you read it and it says causes geombarees
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:11.560]  other neurological disorders luke eric's disease
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:17.160]  brain damage sterilization reduced fertility and cancer
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:20.920]  read the stinking insert and you know what people just take the challenge and
[03:42:20.920 --> 03:42:24.440]  they read the stinking insert and they find out who's telling the truth
[03:42:24.440 --> 03:42:27.800]  and it ain't you chris slime ball mathews let's finish up with this clip
[03:42:27.800 --> 03:42:32.040]  here it is it's a reporting it is the use of the flag don't
[03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:34.680]  tread on me the great gadston flag from south carolina
[03:42:34.680 --> 03:42:37.640]  these people are referring to the federal government states which was
[03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:41.720]  honestly elected tell nobody questions the election of barack obami one with a
[03:42:41.720 --> 03:42:44.760]  good what's it's a good pause again well look
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:49.000]  honestly elected with four times the wall street money
[03:42:49.000 --> 03:42:53.080]  five times the goldman sacks money honestly elected held up as a messianic
[03:42:53.080 --> 03:42:57.000]  leader by the media knowing people were mad at their last puppet bush
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:00.600]  catapulting him in to break every promise uh look
[03:43:00.600 --> 03:43:04.440]  please continue they're saying he's not an american
[03:43:04.440 --> 03:43:07.800]  they're saying he's illegitimate this language i've never heard before
[03:43:07.800 --> 03:43:11.080]  well what's interesting to me about about the about the piece that you did was
[03:43:11.080 --> 03:43:14.120]  that you show the continuum between people
[03:43:14.120 --> 03:43:17.240]  dick armies of the world who you interview who was a member of congress
[03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:21.880]  you know libertarian conservative you know helping to stir up the tea party
[03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:24.840]  and then you have someone like alex jones who we just saw in that clip
[03:43:24.840 --> 03:43:28.120]  a radio talk show host who says he's not right says he's not left
[03:43:28.120 --> 03:43:31.880]  but he says that we are that basically there is a planetary
[03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:35.960]  elite that literally has a secret plan to kill
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:41.960]  80 to 99 percent of the population and you have ran paul going on his radio
[03:43:41.960 --> 03:43:45.480]  show every couple of months in which they talk about the threats to liberty now
[03:43:45.480 --> 03:43:49.640]  let's say ram paul believes the conspiracy theories of alex jones
[03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:53.960]  but by appearing on that show he is somewhat legitimating alex jones as a
[03:43:53.960 --> 03:43:57.240]  voice of the right why one look at dick army we all like i know dick army
[03:43:57.240 --> 03:44:01.400]  i that's enough army will not dissolve and then he will not disown the
[03:44:01.400 --> 03:44:05.000]  birthers he goes on to say well i mean
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:09.560]  his cousin odinga is a mass murderer on record with obama directing him
[03:44:09.560 --> 03:44:13.640]  to riot to be made prime minister they created that position for him
[03:44:13.640 --> 03:44:16.920]  he's from indonesia i've already covered i mean he is an indonesian
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:20.280]  citizen he is illegitimate you can't give up your
[03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:23.800]  us citizenship to be an indonesian citizen and then retroactively get your
[03:44:23.800 --> 03:44:27.960]  us citizenship back he never gave up the indian the indonesian to begin with
[03:44:27.960 --> 03:44:33.400]  what are we doing having a president who's got all these different names
[03:44:33.400 --> 03:44:36.760]  from indonesia
[03:44:36.760 --> 03:44:42.520]  but listen everybody msnbc and cover up of manifestly provable population
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:45.640]  control program a very important article
[03:44:45.640 --> 03:44:49.080]  and then we have another article we're hitting them from all sides msnbc
[03:44:49.080 --> 03:44:53.320]  goons assault tea party activists while pointing fingers at others
[03:44:53.320 --> 03:45:00.280]  for violence that video of msnbc people attacking a reporter with a knife
[03:45:00.280 --> 03:45:05.800]  is up on prisonplanet.com msnbc goons assault tea party activists while
[03:45:05.800 --> 03:45:09.400]  pointing fingers at others for violence and we show other videos of obama
[03:45:09.400 --> 03:45:13.560]  thugs beating people up and the media ignoring it and then meanwhile you've
[03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:16.280]  got last week chrismath you're supporting bill
[03:45:16.280 --> 03:45:19.720]  airs who murdered people and bomb police
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:23.320]  this little punk likes people that bomb police
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:26.920]  i'm up here saying non-violence let's fix this peacefully
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:30.680]  and this little punk is supporting the weathermen
[03:45:30.680 --> 03:45:36.120]  that bombed and killed and wounded and blinded more than 25 police
[03:45:36.120 --> 03:45:40.520]  that's how sick these revolutionaries are but now they're running the country
[03:45:40.520 --> 03:45:44.040]  they're the scumbag revolutionaries they know we're on to them
[03:45:44.040 --> 03:45:47.480]  so they want a dictatorship of their corrupt government
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:50.200]  and i've got all the mainstream news new bill gives
[03:45:50.200 --> 03:45:53.480]  obama kill switch to shut down the internet don't want to read it at
[03:45:53.480 --> 03:45:56.440]  prisonplanet.com go read it at drudgereport.com
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:45:59.560]  now i'm going there and i see a moment on the eugenics front
[03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:04.120]  but before we do that here uh let's uh go to the next clip
[03:46:04.120 --> 03:46:07.640]  by the way that's a small sampling that they're attacking me on every major
[03:46:07.640 --> 03:46:11.880]  show in msnbc why we're effective they know
[03:46:11.880 --> 03:46:16.360]  that if you go read the article msnbc and cover up a manifestly provable
[03:46:16.360 --> 03:46:19.240]  population control plan you're not going to be scared of their
[03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:23.800]  oil spill they staged no doubt of it now and you'll give up all your rights to
[03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:27.560]  them and all this tax money they know that if you
[03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:29.960]  realize just how evil these controllers are
[03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:32.440]  you're not going to be scared a little men in caves anymore and give your
[03:46:32.440 --> 03:46:35.480]  liberties up if you figure out who the real danger is like
[03:46:35.480 --> 03:46:41.000]  thomas jefferson warned us their party is over
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:44.600]  and as newsweek said i am the prophet of the tea parties
[03:46:44.600 --> 03:46:48.920]  they go to the tea parties msnbc told me this so did salon so did the new york
[03:46:48.920 --> 03:46:53.000]  times everywhere they go the majority of
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:57.080]  people say i'm here because of alex jones now you notice you don't see me at
[03:46:57.080 --> 03:47:00.200]  those tea parties i've been invited to a lot of them but i don't go
[03:47:00.200 --> 03:47:04.920]  because i'm busy a b i get their provocateurs then try to stir stuff up
[03:47:04.920 --> 03:47:07.880]  and you know run up and and and and it only takes two or three of them to
[03:47:07.880 --> 03:47:09.560]  claim you're not supposed to be here then they
[03:47:09.560 --> 03:47:13.240]  say i crashed it or something and and it becomes a media staged event there's a
[03:47:13.240 --> 03:47:17.400]  lot of co-intel pro out there also a lot of just jealous mentally ill people
[03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:21.160]  but in the final equation here ladies and gentlemen
[03:47:21.160 --> 03:47:25.160]  they're in a lot of trouble and they know they are uh so
[03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:30.440]  get it out there chris matthew supports terrorists that attack and kill police
[03:47:30.440 --> 03:47:33.320]  meanwhile he wants to say i'm calling for killing cops
[03:47:33.320 --> 03:47:37.240]  which he does later in this video and in the documentary coming out tonight
[03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:42.520]  according to the script we have now i want to turn to erin dykes now because
[03:47:42.520 --> 03:47:46.920]  i mean here's an article out of london independent uk eugenicists demand we
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:49.640]  need a global initiative for population reduction
[03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:54.200]  that's the london independent today i've got another one here Lieberman says pay
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:57.720]  one dollar a day for climate they've got the carbon tax back
[03:47:57.720 --> 03:48:01.800]  uh bp was founding member of cap and trade lobby they admit with the cap and
[03:48:01.800 --> 03:48:06.760]  trade it's to shut down society here's cnn money the 600 billion challenge
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:09.640]  bill gates melinda gates and warren buffett are asking the nation's
[03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:14.600]  billionaires to pledge to give at least half their net worth of charity
[03:48:14.600 --> 03:48:18.280]  if their lifetimes or at death if their campaign succeeds it could change the
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:21.320]  face of philanthropy then you study the philanthropy
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:24.440]  you find out both of them are eugenicists
[03:48:24.440 --> 03:48:27.720]  in fact pull up the headline world's ultra rich meat and secret to discuss
[03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:30.680]  population you find out that they're allowed to
[03:48:30.680 --> 03:48:34.520]  make their money tax-free keep it make more money
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:40.280]  as long as the interest on that money goes for eugenics and i wanted to call
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:42.440]  erin dykes in because it's part of research
[03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:47.480]  for our new eugenics slash kim trail film uh you have gone over the 70 plus
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:52.040]  programs at least 10 of them 30 plus at some degree but at least
[03:48:52.040 --> 03:48:56.040]  10 of them directly are about covert sterilization
[03:48:56.040 --> 03:48:59.400]  uh so erin dykes uh we're about to go to break but start going over
[03:48:59.400 --> 03:49:02.600]  your findings now from your deep research
[03:49:02.600 --> 03:49:07.160]  of these people uh i mean my analysis of the
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:12.360]  of the eugenics kingdom is it accurate oh it's it's so scary that it's accurate
[03:49:12.360 --> 03:49:16.840]  and all these all these computer people have been in the population reduction
[03:49:16.840 --> 03:49:21.400]  over the past half IBM was founded to track blacks and bill gates father's
[03:49:21.400 --> 03:49:24.840]  been involved with population IBM machines were used on the jews with the
[03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:27.160]  numbers everywhere you look you'll find all those
[03:49:27.160 --> 03:49:30.920]  computer companies deep deep deep into eugenics so it's all the more
[03:49:30.920 --> 03:49:34.520]  troubling that all of these programs are for sterilization
[03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:38.200]  contraceptives all mixed with vaccine and scary
[03:49:38.200 --> 03:49:43.400]  sounding uh nanotechnology which are all meant to enhance the vaccines
[03:49:43.400 --> 03:49:46.200]  so and these are some of these are vaccines that reprogram the brain so
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:49.160]  you'll behave yourself don't it's like the pod people it's body
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:52.840]  snatcher take this you'll be one of us now and they're openly saying they're
[03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:55.400]  laughing it doesn't matter if we don't want to take it they're just going to
[03:49:55.400 --> 03:49:59.160]  put it in the food and spray it on us ha ha ha yeah we know there's been ha ha
[03:49:59.160 --> 03:50:02.520]  i'm chris matthews i'm a big fat bastard excuse me
[03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:06.360]  i mean they've forced down a covert sterilization over the years
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:10.200]  sometimes it's been in vaccines and all of a sudden we're supposed to trust
[03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:13.320]  bill gates when he turns into a mad scientist and we've got hundreds of
[03:50:13.320 --> 03:50:16.760]  mainstream reports where they add sterilization compounds to the vaccines
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:19.640]  to sterilize yeah and it's always hidden in
[03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:23.640]  lied to african villages and they riot and they just do it anyway
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:28.040]  and now we have at least 10 programs for contraceptives or sterilization
[03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:31.560]  which can be covertly slipped into vaccines into foods
[03:50:31.560 --> 03:50:37.000]  water you name it because a lot of it is based on nanotechnology take this one
[03:50:37.000 --> 03:50:41.080]  a zeolite hydrogel nano mop for contraception
[03:50:41.080 --> 03:50:46.280]  it attacks the fructose in sperm to take away the energy to impregnate
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:50.200]  using nanotechnology stay there and then he talks about covert delivery
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:53.240]  methods oh the slaves aren't taking the shots
[03:50:53.240 --> 03:50:58.840]  i'm bill gates his little evil look you people are going to be exterminated
[03:50:58.840 --> 03:51:02.360]  you're not going to stop me

[03:55:13.960 --> 03:55:17.560]  today calling for global one-child policies erin keep going through the
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:21.800]  vaccines though i'm sorry well there's a lot of vaccine as well as a
[03:55:21.800 --> 03:55:25.960]  contraceptive stuff one of the scarier ones that has already been reported
[03:55:25.960 --> 03:55:29.000]  is they're going to use ultrasound as a long-term
[03:55:29.000 --> 03:55:33.480]  reversible male contraceptive uh but it effectively sterilizes you because you
[03:55:33.480 --> 03:55:38.200]  have to go back in uh they have a lot of uh but it's okay to ultrasound babies
[03:55:38.200 --> 03:55:41.640]  even though it's been linked to brain damage but it does fry your sperm
[03:55:41.640 --> 03:55:45.640]  but that's okay just do it to your baby's brain where the government
[03:55:45.640 --> 03:55:49.160]  i mean we have a scientific dictatorship attacking sperm

[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:19.000]  include a laser vaccine which will target alicia mania
[03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:23.640]  there will be a live virus with the self-destruct sequence and a new vaccine
[03:56:23.640 --> 03:56:28.120]  technology uh there will be nanoparticles that deliver
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:34.440]  pathogenic microbes another study is for a pollen
[03:56:34.440 --> 03:56:38.680]  mimicking nanoparticle which will deliver a vaccine
[03:56:38.680 --> 03:56:42.280]  upon contact with human sweat and deliver
[03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:45.400]  um you know that one targets the hair follicles
