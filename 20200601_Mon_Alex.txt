[00:00.000 --> 00:23.360]  If you thought Info Wars was in the zeitgeist before, this is one transmission you're not
[00:23.360 --> 00:29.960]  going to want to miss because I have extreme clarity on exactly what's going on, what the
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.320]  globalists are up to, what their next move is going to be.
[00:35.320 --> 00:41.640]  On the surface, we know why Antifa funded by the Communist Chinese, George Soros, and
[00:41.640 --> 00:46.760]  the criminal networks of Obama and Hillary have launched the attempts at civil war across
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.600]  the country that have so far been extremely successful.
[00:51.600 --> 00:57.280]  I can tell you that crime has exploded massively.
[00:57.280 --> 01:03.040]  In the last 24 hours, four people I know have been brutally robbed, broken into, or attempted
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.920]  to be robbed.
[01:04.920 --> 01:12.320]  Mr. Cargill of Central Texas Gun Works had thugs come and break into his facility, but
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.440]  they were unsuccessful at being able to steal any of the firearms.
[01:15.440 --> 01:17.720]  That's just down the street.
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.240]  He'll be joining us coming up in studio with exclusive surveillance camera footage that
[01:22.240 --> 01:24.920]  Fox News has asked for, but we're getting first.
[01:24.920 --> 01:27.360]  We appreciate him bringing that in.
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.240]  Remember this headline a couple years ago?
[01:29.240 --> 01:36.080]  Full page ad in the New York Times saying overthrow the government, Antifa, it begins.
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.440]  And then the next July, they said we're going to overthrow the government July 4th, start
[01:39.440 --> 01:40.440]  the riots.
[01:40.440 --> 01:46.880]  They actually had mainstream news say that I made this up and this doesn't exist.
[01:46.880 --> 01:49.080]  And that's because Trump said, is that true?
[01:49.080 --> 01:52.040]  And so they actually had articles written so they could show him to the White House
[01:52.040 --> 01:53.040]  Chief of Staff.
[01:53.040 --> 01:56.240]  I was told could come to them and say, see, Mr. President, it never happened.
[01:56.240 --> 02:02.560]  Well, is this attempt to overthrow the newly elected government happening or not?
[02:02.560 --> 02:03.560]  Is it?
[02:03.560 --> 02:06.600]  But that's the type of stuff we deal with.
[02:06.600 --> 02:13.360]  You know, I was sitting up here yesterday, reviewing hours of raw footage that the great
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.560]  crew got led by Savannah Hernandez.
[02:18.560 --> 02:22.120]  And I told her, I said, you need to stop going out there without the security.
[02:22.120 --> 02:23.400]  She said, well, that brings them down on me.
[02:23.400 --> 02:25.600]  And I said, well, I might have to get you in a lot of trouble.
[02:25.600 --> 02:27.400]  She said, well, I'm doing this on my own and you're not stopping me.
[02:27.400 --> 02:29.080]  I said, okay, whatever.
[02:29.080 --> 02:30.920]  Very dangerous stuff.
[02:30.920 --> 02:32.160]  And she saw people get beat up.
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.440]  You name it, went over and confronted full grown men and stopped them.
[02:36.440 --> 02:37.440]  It's powerful.
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.560]  But I'm watching footage and I go, what is this?
[02:43.560 --> 02:46.560]  This is them raiding a homeless camp under 35, isn't it?
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.720]  I know the homeless camp well, can't go downtown without seeing it.
[02:50.720 --> 02:51.720]  And they go, yeah.
[02:51.720 --> 03:00.320]  I go, is this footage not out yet of the homeless camp being burned?
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.040]  I said, you got to put that immediately and say, and if it burns homeless camp, well,
[03:04.040 --> 03:07.280]  they put out one little clip of the camp being burned.
[03:07.280 --> 03:14.360]  That's the number one clip on Twitter that we're 20 million views right now, okay?
[03:14.360 --> 03:21.040]  So we're going to premiere for you the actual burning of the homeless camp.
[03:21.040 --> 03:23.560]  Oh, there's not just one thing getting burned.
[03:23.560 --> 03:26.960]  It's anti-foot burning the whole damn thing.
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.040]  With mentally ill women like lying on the ground shaking while there's fires going off
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.840]  behind them, and I say that because a lot of those homeless are mentally ill down there.
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.600]  They basically burned an open air mental institution in the ground.
[03:38.600 --> 03:40.120]  We're going to show you all this coming up.
[03:40.120 --> 03:44.160]  We're going to have Savannah Hernandez and Zach, he's been here five years as a camera
[03:44.160 --> 03:45.160]  guy.
[03:45.160 --> 03:46.160]  I don't know if he wants his last name on there.
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.480]  We'll find out when he comes on, but he was down there.
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.700]  He's now been accused by the Twitter mob of he's the one that burned the homeless camp.
[03:54.700 --> 03:58.640]  Because when they're burning it, one old Marine who's homeless goes and says, how dare you
[03:58.640 --> 04:01.760]  anti-foot runs off like cockroaches when the lights turn on.
[04:01.760 --> 04:04.720]  They run up to Zach.
[04:04.720 --> 04:07.520]  Zach doesn't run because he didn't burn it down.
[04:07.520 --> 04:10.240]  And the guys start screaming saying, why have you done this?
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.520]  Because he just sees him as a protester.
[04:13.520 --> 04:21.040]  Top of Twitter, Alex Jones stages attack burns homeless camp.
[04:21.040 --> 04:27.640]  So that's the type of crazy we got going on, but I haven't even scratched the surface yet.
[04:27.640 --> 04:35.840]  We have so many exclusives here today that my head is officially blown.
[04:35.840 --> 04:45.240]  We have George Floyd exclusive Intel that is bomb shell to the max.
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.920]  You think him being a porn star quote is big?
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.160]  You think him knowing both the cops is big?
[04:52.160 --> 04:54.400]  We just solved the case.
[04:54.400 --> 04:55.400]  What's really going on?
[04:55.400 --> 04:58.920]  It's going to be broken here exclusively right now.
[04:58.920 --> 04:59.920]  Memorial Day is here.
[04:59.920 --> 05:02.000]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.600]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch
[05:05.600 --> 05:07.120]  of items are selling out.
[05:07.120 --> 05:10.600]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale.
[05:10.600 --> 05:13.680]  And then five items that weren't on sale, we got back in stock.
[05:13.680 --> 05:17.640]  They're also massively discounted as well for the Memorial Day special.

[05:45.480 --> 05:47.280]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[05:47.280 --> 05:51.080]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your
[05:51.080 --> 05:53.960]  family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[05:53.960 --> 05:55.640]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[05:55.640 --> 06:16.640]  We are all in this together.
[06:16.640 --> 06:23.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, with only 154 days out from the election, we are live and we are
[06:23.600 --> 06:29.720]  broadcasting worldwide in defiance of globalist tyranny, in defiance of their attempts to
[06:29.720 --> 06:30.880]  shut us down.
[06:30.880 --> 06:37.040]  It is the final countdown on this June 1st, 2020, Monday transmission.
[06:37.040 --> 06:38.040]  Okay.
[06:38.040 --> 06:42.120]  Let me just tell you what's coming up today.
[06:42.120 --> 06:52.120]  We have George Floyd, exclusive video, exclusive analysis, exclusive information that when
[06:52.120 --> 06:58.280]  I learned 30 minutes ago, we had and that Rob do's intrepid son who assume he's out
[06:58.280 --> 06:59.280]  of high school.
[06:59.280 --> 07:05.120]  Oh, he's got a golf scholarship or whatever, but we need to get him working in here, finding
[07:05.120 --> 07:06.920]  this hidden in plain view.
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.600]  That's going to come up at the start of the next hour.
[07:11.600 --> 07:16.640]  We'll release that next hour and quite frankly, it's so big, I'm going to have to go off air
[07:16.640 --> 07:20.840]  here in a moment with a special report I was already planning to air so I can just go make
[07:20.840 --> 07:25.000]  sure that this torpedo gets lined up and fired down the tube correctly.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.360]  The crew is great, but I just need to like say a few prayers over it and kiss it and
[07:29.360 --> 07:36.400]  write a little message on it because I'm serious, I'm going to say a little prayer over it because
[07:36.400 --> 07:43.640]  this is gigantor and again, because we're open and we're conscious and we're aware.
[07:43.640 --> 07:50.880]  We continue to break the huge exclusive Intel that devastates the globalist now as big as
[07:50.880 --> 07:51.880]  that is.
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.480]  It's a distraction.
[07:55.480 --> 07:59.720]  This morning I got up at 3am and couldn't sleep again and did deep research till about
[07:59.720 --> 08:08.440]  6am when I went for a hike and it absolutely hit me why they formulaically triggered these
[08:08.440 --> 08:13.920]  riots now, they had all sorts of incidents they could already use and it was to cover
[08:13.920 --> 08:20.640]  up the fact that the COVID-19 hoax has completely collapsed and it turns out that the German
[08:20.640 --> 08:30.440]  Interior Ministry, that's the third most powerful position in the German government, had a panel
[08:30.440 --> 08:40.720]  of top scientists that secretly reviewed COVID-19 for over a month and found it to be a hoax.
[08:40.720 --> 08:44.200]  And everything that's in the report you've already heard here, they count every regular
[08:44.200 --> 08:49.040]  death as that, the UN is directing it, why is the UN directing it, the Germans ask, this
[08:49.040 --> 08:55.000]  is top scientists, they got a big problem, because they're still integrity in our scientists.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.800]  In China, scientists do what they're told or they're killed so you get disasters.
[08:58.800 --> 09:03.480]  We've got big enough problems here but we still have a lot of integrity with our scientists
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.360]  and our doctors and our nurses and people and in law enforcement to a great extent.
[09:08.360 --> 09:10.600]  The West is virtuous, you think we're bad?
[09:10.600 --> 09:14.480]  Go look at other countries and then you're like, wow, we're really good.
[09:14.480 --> 09:21.480]  So this is so big that it's sending chills up and down my spine.
[09:21.480 --> 09:24.620]  I knew about this on Friday, I was going to come in and do a special report Saturday
[09:24.620 --> 09:30.720]  on it but I didn't because I was so busy dealing with the break-ins and the robberies and the
[09:30.720 --> 09:37.000]  buildings on fire and I've had people bow up on me and parking lots and threaten me
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.720]  and say, we're going to get you just because of who I am, it's bad.
[09:41.720 --> 09:45.160]  There's hours of footage of it, actually we put out live feed, we have our own live feed
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.600]  systems now banned on video, thanks for your support, we've built the infrastructure for
[09:48.600 --> 09:49.600]  this exact time.
[09:49.600 --> 09:55.720]  It is insane but we could sit here and cover the riots, we could cover George Floyd, we
[09:55.720 --> 10:02.120]  could cover the martial law and Trump saying that Antifa's a terror group, which they are,
[10:02.120 --> 10:09.120]  still a dangerous slippery slope but the COVID hoax collapsing but now they've already got
[10:09.120 --> 10:13.200]  us into the next reason to have the economy shut down and the next reason to the moralizes
[10:13.200 --> 10:17.440]  and the next reason to tell us America sucks in the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[10:17.440 --> 10:23.680]  the Atlanta newspaper, the Seattle Times, America is in a low ebb shaken by multiple
[10:23.680 --> 10:29.020]  blows and Trump adds to the distress, that's right.
[10:29.020 --> 10:35.520]  This is those people trying to strangle us politically and make us submit to their out
[10:35.520 --> 10:43.640]  of control tyranny but that's not even the tip of the iceberg, I already and so does
[10:43.640 --> 10:48.240]  Matt Bracken and many others know what's coming next in the playbook, just as sure as sun
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.600]  goes down at you know eight o'clock at night right now or eight thirty and you know sun
[10:52.600 --> 11:02.280]  comes back up at six thirty, like night follows day, I know what the next move is and if Trump
[11:02.280 --> 11:07.200]  and the military and the police and the people don't do the right thing we're going to be
[11:07.200 --> 11:17.360]  muscled in on by the chai comms and their collaborators and they are going to bring the country down.
[11:17.360 --> 11:25.800]  They'd like to do it the next two months so everybody better do the gut check and reach
[11:25.800 --> 11:33.560]  down and see if you got those wavos anymore because submission to this is enslavement.
[11:33.560 --> 11:39.160]  All the cakewalks, all the candy-assing, all the going along to get along, all the subservience,
[11:39.160 --> 11:44.920]  all the bowing, all of the following political correctness has made the establishment believe
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.280]  that you are done.
[11:48.280 --> 11:51.720]  The oven goes ding and the goose is cooked.
[11:51.720 --> 11:57.000]  I don't believe that, I don't think that, but they are going to make their full death
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.560]  blow move now and it doesn't just include attempts to kill the president, it doesn't
[12:03.560 --> 12:08.400]  just, no, no, no, they want to kill the whole thing and break them around and I know how
[12:08.400 --> 12:17.160]  they're going to do it and this is probably going to cause a giant war but the chai comms
[12:17.160 --> 12:20.960]  and all the people they're involved with just are spiritually so committed to destroying
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.480]  what's left of a once-christian nation that it truly is an act of Satanism, they can't
[12:25.480 --> 12:26.480]  help themselves.
[12:26.480 --> 12:30.600]  It's like Hitler couldn't just stop attacking everybody or the commies couldn't stop trying
[12:30.600 --> 12:31.680]  to take over.
[12:31.680 --> 12:38.360]  This is the same, they just can't help it, they're maniacs and so I'm going to tell you
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.520]  what's coming next and they're just trying to set the table for it right now and I'll
[12:42.520 --> 12:55.080]  break it down, last segment of this hour and then let's just do this, let's get Savannah
[12:55.080 --> 13:02.920]  Hernandez and Zach in here, bottom of the next hour, I know I was going to have them
[13:02.920 --> 13:06.440]  bottom of this hour but let's have them bottom of the next hour so we have time to line up
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.640]  all the videos and all that because it's bigger than just Twitter trying to say we stage burning
[13:10.640 --> 13:18.400]  down a homeless camp, it's bigger than their attack on M4s, it's the criminal will that
[13:18.400 --> 13:24.800]  Twitter has, chai comms funded to let foreign governments attack America, let foreign governments
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.480]  run all their propaganda but then not let the president tweet.
[13:29.480 --> 13:39.480]  So that's going to come up next hour and it's huge as well, it's amazing, you believe we
[13:39.480 --> 13:45.120]  caught Antifa burning down the homeless camp and our guys have just put out a short clip,
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.160]  we've got a whole camp being burned down and Twitter boosted a guy's tweet to the top saying
[13:52.160 --> 13:59.320]  we did it, wow, wow man but again they're going for broke ladies and gentlemen, there's
[13:59.320 --> 14:06.680]  nothing they won't do, you think Jack Dorsey is really a little wimp, a little beardy,
[14:06.680 --> 14:13.760]  acts all feminine, that's a cover, these are scientifically evil people committed to absolute
[14:13.760 --> 14:19.920]  destruction and as soon as you wake up to that you'll be able to defeat them but until
[14:19.920 --> 14:26.280]  you realize you're dealing with homicidal criminals, you don't have a damn hope, okay
[14:26.280 --> 14:29.760]  so that's all coming up and I'm just going to throw this out here because it's so critical
[14:29.760 --> 14:39.120]  as well, as you've noticed we've been a little busy and so I have not come up with new specials
[14:39.120 --> 14:42.160]  so I just doubled down because things are so insane, I just have a gut level feeling
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.760]  things are going to get so bad, I'm just emptying out our warehouses, I said I wouldn't
[14:45.760 --> 14:49.720]  go below 40% last year because in the actuaries it's hard for us to fund ourselves because
[14:49.720 --> 14:53.000]  we don't have enough markup to be able to cut it that much than fund ourselves but you
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.600]  know what, I just gut level, I think we should just sell out of everything we've got to get
[14:58.600 --> 15:02.640]  the funds in to operate right through this election so we are extending for at least
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.960]  another two days, 60% off across the board, flash sale, infowarstore.com, our biggest

[15:56.480 --> 15:59.480]  transmission now.
[15:59.480 --> 16:04.400]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[16:04.400 --> 16:08.040]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.240]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain
[16:12.240 --> 16:16.800]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches
[16:16.800 --> 16:19.600]  across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[16:19.600 --> 16:23.960]  So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.320]  and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going
[16:28.320 --> 16:33.280]  on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years, they're
[16:33.280 --> 16:37.800]  in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked
[16:37.800 --> 16:39.760]  off to be ready and it funds the info war.

[18:00.600 --> 18:29.400]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.440]  We are live on this June 1st, Monday Transmission.
[18:36.440 --> 18:42.960]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.960]  Where should we start?
[18:43.960 --> 18:47.880]  I'm doing the best I can.
[18:47.880 --> 18:51.360]  Let me just succinctly tell you what is coming up.
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.320]  The German Interior Ministry had a panel of top scientists that looked at COVID-19 in the
[18:56.320 --> 19:02.400]  last three months and they came out and said it is a total hoax that all the normal seasonal
[19:02.400 --> 19:07.320]  deaths from other things have been attributed to it and that it's just a cold virus and
[19:07.320 --> 19:14.000]  that it's destroyed civilization and society and that it was a, quote, a false alarm, a
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.400]  global false alarm, what the report says.
[19:16.400 --> 19:20.240]  Well, yeah, it's a crying wolf to shut down civilization.
[19:20.240 --> 19:27.320]  If you fire a gun to panic wild bison and make them stampede and run off the edge of
[19:27.320 --> 19:33.040]  a cliff, it's not a false alarm, it's a false flag.
[19:33.040 --> 19:36.520]  Now how ultra massive is that?
[19:36.520 --> 19:41.440]  And see, that's why they then triggered the race riots they already had ready to go.
[19:41.440 --> 19:43.520]  They've always got some event that they could use.
[19:43.520 --> 19:45.840]  It's constantly happening.
[19:45.840 --> 19:52.120]  The lockdown served to get people tightly wound ready to blow, sick of the police doing
[19:52.120 --> 19:56.280]  the wrong thing, making people, you know, stay in their houses for hoax.
[19:56.280 --> 19:58.600]  And then finally the detonator went off.
[19:58.600 --> 20:03.360]  All the Hollywood movies about race war, all the purge movies, all the pushing didn't work.
[20:03.360 --> 20:10.320]  Obama was trying it eight, nine years ago, didn't work.
[20:10.320 --> 20:15.040]  And so they had to lock us down, get us ready to know the cases would come up, know the
[20:15.040 --> 20:16.440]  cases would unfold.
[20:16.440 --> 20:21.080]  He had the jogger that was really case in places, he gets killed, trying to cause a
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.080]  race war with that.
[20:22.080 --> 20:23.080]  That didn't work.
[20:23.080 --> 20:25.120]  Now this didn't work because it's all white people.
[20:25.120 --> 20:28.280]  I've been all over Austin and I've watched the videos.
[20:28.280 --> 20:35.840]  During the day it's 90% white people out there trying to lead black people into an uprising.
[20:35.840 --> 20:40.800]  And days ago there were pallets of bricks being delivered in Dallas in places in the
[20:40.800 --> 20:44.000]  black neighborhoods and into the main shopping districts.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.720]  People said, oh, well that's just an accident.
[20:45.720 --> 20:53.640]  Now from Louisiana to New York to California, the pallets of blocks or bricks are being
[20:53.640 --> 20:56.320]  delivered.
[20:56.320 --> 20:57.880]  And they're just set down there.
[20:57.880 --> 21:02.160]  So Trump doesn't even need to declare a terrorist group, sure go ahead because they're politically
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.960]  trying to shut down speech, they're politically trying to intimidate people, they attack folks
[21:05.960 --> 21:09.600]  physically who've done nothing to them, that's the definition of a terror group, threatening
[21:09.600 --> 21:13.120]  violence or carrying out violence for a political or economic gain.
[21:13.120 --> 21:17.800]  They are the definition of it and they wear Cobra Commander outfits, they're terrorists.
[21:17.800 --> 21:20.120]  They're bad guys in masks.
[21:20.120 --> 21:25.600]  But under racketeering, under organized crime, they are out there coordinating with their
[21:25.600 --> 21:30.840]  radios, they have HQs, they're commanded by Alexander Soros on record.
[21:30.840 --> 21:36.100]  We got the secret documents two years ago and all hell broke loose Soros financing lawsuits
[21:36.100 --> 21:37.600]  against us since then.
[21:37.600 --> 21:38.600]  Well guess what?
[21:38.600 --> 21:39.600]  You old Nazi.
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.960]  We beat Hitler and we're going to beat you.
[21:44.960 --> 21:46.720]  Soros wants you to hate black people, folks.
[21:46.720 --> 21:49.000]  The Democratic Party wants you to abort black people.
[21:49.000 --> 21:55.200]  That's why they're financing all of this because they think they own black people and it's
[21:55.200 --> 21:59.520]  totally sick and it's totally evil and it's totally transparent.
[21:59.520 --> 22:06.400]  They want us to read the documents, 2015, Obama planned martial law in Maryland, anti
[22:06.400 --> 22:10.680]  foe was working with the police captains to order the police to stand down and let them
[22:10.680 --> 22:20.320]  loot and attack in a hope that black Marylanders, Baltimoreians and others would riot, triggering
[22:20.320 --> 22:26.400]  a nationwide uprising and that's why Democrat mayors and governors are promoting it and
[22:26.400 --> 22:34.080]  saying it's good and endorsing it because that's what they want to destroy the faith
[22:34.080 --> 22:39.560]  and confidence in the dollar to say America is a failed nation so that communist China
[22:39.560 --> 22:48.320]  and North Korea and more than anybody, Iran are all celebrating all of this and there's
[22:48.320 --> 22:55.720]  a big case, Paul Watson tweeted it out and we can pull it up, of a famous major league
[22:55.720 --> 23:01.400]  NBA player who said go out and attack the white stores, go out and loot, but when they
[23:01.400 --> 23:05.800]  came to his neighborhood, his gated community, which was full of people of all colors and
[23:05.800 --> 23:09.720]  tried to burn it down, he's like get out of here, I saw you attacking my house, what
[23:09.720 --> 23:14.360]  the hell, I'm black.
[23:14.360 --> 23:17.720]  You think people that are going to come loot your neighborhood be black or white or are
[23:17.720 --> 23:23.360]  good people and so they're going to not pass your house over and what happens when the
[23:23.360 --> 23:28.640]  civilization breaks down, we'll be just like all those third world hell holes where people
[23:28.640 --> 23:34.840]  riot and kill each other constantly, so everybody's fighting to get into America, everybody's
[23:34.840 --> 23:46.560]  fighting to get into this nation, to be oppressed, now I will tell you in the looting footage
[23:46.560 --> 23:54.400]  it's about 80% black, in Austin we shot the footage, in other parts of the country because
[23:54.400 --> 24:00.000]  the black folks are poor and they're told hey it's time to go out and loot, but when
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.600]  it's the leading the instigation and going out and pulling the police forces away, it's
[24:05.600 --> 24:13.120]  the antifa who are a bunch of Ivy League trash and university garbage, white people that
[24:13.120 --> 24:20.360]  are in a giant sociology experiment manipulating folks and you talk about evil, you talk about
[24:20.360 --> 24:25.440]  corruption, you talk about black people caught in the spider's web of the left that literally
[24:25.440 --> 24:33.720]  on record wants to kill them and they can't even break free from it because they've been
[24:33.720 --> 24:46.680]  in the bondage so long, it's disgusting and it's sad, it's very very dangerous, now I'm
[24:46.680 --> 25:04.720]  really controlling myself because in the last segment of this hour I am going to
[25:04.720 --> 25:08.360]  lay out the big master plan on what's coming next because we can analyze the riots and
[25:08.360 --> 25:11.760]  the looting and it's very interesting and it's very frightening and it's very concerning,
[25:11.760 --> 25:16.640]  we can argue that all day long and we're going to cover that because hell I have to,
[25:16.640 --> 25:22.000]  if they're successful saying I'm burning down homeless camps, I'm even in more trouble,
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.440]  that's all over the news right now that we went and burned down a homeless camp.
[25:25.440 --> 25:30.240]  The Democrats did it, we shot video of it so we're guilty, so I'm going to cover that
[25:30.240 --> 25:39.320]  some next hour so I can show you what really went on, but we know how all this connects
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.320]  together and what the globalist plan is from their own admissions and our own research
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.880]  and so I'm going to tell you what's coming next and really the normal leadership counts
[25:48.880 --> 25:54.440]  because you boost the show and you share it, but I'm really talking to the Pentagon and
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.600]  I'm really talking to the military and the police and the local constabularies because
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.040]  you're not where America used to be, you can't just sit back and laugh at all this and oh
[26:04.040 --> 26:08.720]  well we'll defeat the globalists and the commies, this is their real move and they've got a
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.800]  good chance of winning if you are arrogant about this and don't have decisive action
[26:13.800 --> 26:22.720]  so I am having to prepare a evacuation okay and I don't do this because I want to run
[26:22.720 --> 26:28.720]  but if Americans are so soft and so stupid that we can't stop this that's pure evil
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.760]  then we deserve what happens to us and we can't be helped and the very same globalist
[26:33.760 --> 26:38.880]  that wrecked and robbed Russia in 1917 are going to have their way with us in a way you've
[26:38.880 --> 26:47.480]  never imagined so the parties over folks unless the globalists are decapitated and I'm not
[26:47.480 --> 26:50.600]  the one that's going to do that and citizens shouldn't do that but now is the time the
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.000]  house of war we need Trump to decisively the military to take action now.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.720]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[26:59.720 --> 27:04.480]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot
[27:04.480 --> 27:09.640]  and then it finally dies she said well yeah when I grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.280]  there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.920]  that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.640]  around gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well
[27:24.640 --> 27:29.480]  that's what's going to happen with our economy it is in cardiac arrest this has been done
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.400]  by design and the UN the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to
[27:35.400 --> 27:40.520]  keep the economy closed so remember the depression that's coming and the third world collapse
[27:40.520 --> 27:47.880]  is all on the UN on Bill and Melinda Gates on Obama on Hillary on Biden on the Democrats
[27:47.880 --> 27:52.520]  we tried to stop it we tried to fight it you guys said you want to wreck America and the
[27:52.520 --> 27:55.320]  world and now you've done it congratulations.

[30:19.040 --> 30:32.680]  well we always knew the globalists would make their big move with concerted destabilization
[30:32.680 --> 30:37.360]  of the planet and I always knew it would be hectic when it all went down they launched
[30:37.360 --> 30:42.680]  their main assault man we're now in the hurricane we are in the typhoon and it's going to just
[30:42.680 --> 30:47.140]  get crazier from here on out and I got to tell you ladies and gentlemen if you're in
[30:47.140 --> 30:52.120]  denial about how evil these people are it's just going to hurt you bad only chance you've
[30:52.120 --> 30:58.840]  gots getting hardcore only damn chance we've all got is to stop caring about the house
[30:58.840 --> 31:03.400]  and the boat and the getting along with the neighbors that's all gone ladies and gentlemen
[31:03.400 --> 31:08.680]  we were fat and dumb and let them kill 60 plus million babies and now we're killing all
[31:08.680 --> 31:12.800]  the old people and now they're putting covid inside the nursing homes knowing that it's
[31:12.800 --> 31:19.520]  a bad pneumonia so they could get some death numbers I mean imagine the diabolical nature
[31:19.520 --> 31:24.080]  of just one of the things these globalists do and it's because there are a bunch of
[31:24.080 --> 31:30.360]  psychopaths that are totally cold blooded and they all get together in rooms and convince
[31:30.360 --> 31:35.520]  each other that what they're doing is normal or okay obviously it's going to blow up in
[31:35.520 --> 31:42.320]  their face obviously they're all going to be destroyed but in the process we're probably
[31:42.320 --> 31:47.600]  going to end up having major power outages starvation mass riots nuclear war is on the
[31:47.600 --> 31:54.440]  table I mean I'm somebody that can handle this stuff I'm pretty mentally tough okay
[31:54.440 --> 31:58.760]  and I'm literally looking at my children every day and already saying bye bye to them and
[31:58.760 --> 32:04.760]  just saying praying with them and just that's how bad this is ladies and gentlemen but I
[32:04.760 --> 32:11.000]  use the analogy of a dodo bird on Galapagos Island and they were gone in a couple years
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.040]  the western whalerships show up there's big fat dumb birds fatter than turkeys they've
[32:16.040 --> 32:21.440]  never been around a predator not no coyotes no wolves no weasels no humans and these
[32:21.440 --> 32:26.280]  dodo birds you'd hat one on the head with a club and the other dodo bird walk right
[32:26.280 --> 32:35.400]  up to you just didn't even have any instinct because they proven experiences are passed
[32:35.400 --> 32:40.960]  on by those that survived genetically encoding and there's a sixth sense that once animals
[32:40.960 --> 32:47.480]  begin to get hunted intact it takes a few generations normally for them to develop instincts
[32:47.480 --> 32:53.040]  and see we don't have it we're always told we're so bad America's been incredibly free
[32:53.040 --> 32:58.680]  compared to other nations and now we have no experience with communism and globalism
[32:58.680 --> 33:20.000]  and Islam and we are like dodo birds man stupid dumb conceded satisfied
[33:20.000 --> 33:28.400]  God help us and drudge has the headline Trump hides in bunker as protest rage that's the
[33:28.400 --> 33:34.800]  message the last putting out to go attack Trump's hiding in a bunker no that's where
[33:34.800 --> 33:43.680]  Trump directs the cog response let's go back to the headline calls governor's week fools
[33:43.680 --> 33:53.200]  and jerks and now we need slave reparations and now we have white people in Washington
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.280]  state in other areas the police department kneeling to black people and apologizing for
[33:58.280 --> 34:10.680]  being white that's pure communism total mental illness no that's that's that's one police
[34:10.680 --> 34:16.840]  chief kneeling for a prayer there's another video of white people kneeling along with
[34:16.840 --> 34:25.400]  the police apologizing to black people totally separate so this is all the mindlessness that
[34:25.400 --> 34:29.480]  goes on I mean if the white people kneeled down and said sorry we didn't work harder
[34:29.480 --> 34:32.680]  and let Margaret Sanger aboard all these people that I'd say oh that's reasonable but this
[34:32.680 --> 34:38.920]  is all again this perception ladies and gentlemen there it is videos up on info wars dot com video
[34:38.920 --> 34:48.000]  white people Portland cops take a knee that's forgiveness for racism the white people bow
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.040]  to the black people the idea is you bow down because my ancestors had to bow down even
[34:54.040 --> 35:00.440]  though only two percent of the south had slaves even though most American European immigrants
[35:00.440 --> 35:07.560]  came here after slavery if my grandfather committed a crime though I don't bow to you
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.800]  because he did something wrong this is about shared guilt you don't have to bow down to
[35:12.800 --> 35:17.720]  a political agenda it doesn't give those black people any future to bow down to them it's
[35:17.720 --> 35:27.760]  a it's a virtue signaling fraud it's a lie and it's not about being humble it's not
[35:27.760 --> 35:34.640]  about saying you're sorry it it's about buying into an agenda of getting on your knees not
[35:34.640 --> 35:39.480]  to the black people but to Nike that owns the slave factories in China and Amazon that's
[35:39.480 --> 35:43.760]  financing all this while they take all of our rights and all of our futures and all
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.640]  of our jobs and while they shut us all down they say though the new religion is bowing
[35:49.640 --> 35:54.120]  because you're bad because you're white and that's really what they just said Martin Luther
[35:54.120 --> 35:57.640]  King saw that he'd say this is the most evil thing I've ever seen you don't judge somebody
[35:57.640 --> 36:02.760]  on the content of their color but the content of their deeds which is common sense ladies
[36:02.760 --> 36:07.760]  and gentlemen which is what the abolitionist said you don't just say the black people are
[36:07.760 --> 36:12.040]  all bad you judge people on the content of their character and who they are and if they
[36:12.040 --> 36:18.440]  were given a chance to have an education and have a future how would they perform and it
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.240]  shows you people like Alan keys and countless others that got a good education travel the
[36:22.240 --> 36:26.080]  world are the smartest people out there but see the left made sure black people didn't
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.960]  get educations they made sure they couldn't have guns they made sure that drug dealing
[36:29.960 --> 36:34.840]  only happened in their neighborhoods those are the red light districts it's all been
[36:34.840 --> 36:40.280]  set up by them and now they're playing us all off against each other in the most sickest
[36:40.280 --> 36:49.480]  freakish thing I've ever seen but let me just stop right there I have footage from all over
[36:49.480 --> 37:00.120]  the country there's an article on info wars.com by Steve Watson that shows pallets of bricks
[37:00.120 --> 37:07.840]  and they're the same gray brick all over the country the same company the same 18 wheelers
[37:07.840 --> 37:12.720]  delivered and put right there in the districts by the stores and we have the documents where
[37:12.720 --> 37:20.040]  Alexander Soros runs similar things before and so all over the country they've been dropped
[37:20.040 --> 37:31.400]  off and prepared we don't need new laws to go after Soros is being a terrorist we have
[37:31.400 --> 37:36.920]  them in a giant mafia operation directing criminal activity as Bernard Couric the former
[37:36.920 --> 37:45.400]  New York police commissioner said and as the head of the justice department attorney general
[37:45.400 --> 37:51.320]  has said I mean this is organized crime ladies and gentlemen cut and dry open and shut with
[37:51.320 --> 37:58.440]  the documents with the proof indict them now go after them now but the justice department
[37:58.440 --> 38:06.120]  about 60% of them were put in by globalist and so they're all got anti for coffee mugs
[38:06.120 --> 38:11.440]  man half the FBI's got anti for coffee mugs I'm not joking there's articles on info wars
[38:11.440 --> 38:16.880]  that show all these senior FBI and attorney generals and with anti for coffee mugs and
[38:16.880 --> 38:24.720]  anti for literature who do you think funds this this is their domestic security force
[38:24.720 --> 38:30.360]  I was out there in Austin yesterday ladies and gentlemen and there were people wearing
[38:30.360 --> 38:37.000]  not the current communist Chinese uniform but the LARPing malice revolutionary youth
[38:37.000 --> 38:42.760]  brigade uniforms full grown men we have video of it it's in my live feed by the Capitol
[38:42.760 --> 38:46.760]  guys you find that later because I got a shot of it is up on the top of the vehicles they
[38:46.760 --> 38:51.640]  were throwing bottles of water and metal rods were clacking off the side my security guys
[38:51.640 --> 38:57.840]  were trying to make me get back in the vehicle and that commie looked right at me and he
[38:57.840 --> 39:02.280]  said we're gonna kill you he was right down there 10 feet from me looked up this big fat
[39:02.280 --> 39:09.080]  basement dweller he's wearing this larpher outfit and the malice youth brigade uniform
[39:09.080 --> 39:14.240]  he looked at me and said we're gonna kill you Jones well not without a fight you sack
[39:14.240 --> 39:21.400]  of crap because we're not the poor Chinese peasants under 5000 years of serfdom and the
[39:21.400 --> 39:24.840]  differences your dog manure to me so I don't want to have to wipe you off my shoes but
[39:24.840 --> 39:33.960]  I will it just went on and on and on and on and they're all wearing commie outfits they're
[39:33.960 --> 39:39.520]  all gonna get you they're all so tough they're all so powerful they're all such big men and
[39:39.520 --> 39:46.000]  they've all been promised a position of power over you in the gulags yeah it's about five
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.280]  minutes for timis for that video you'll use I'm videotaping driving by the crowd there's
[39:50.280 --> 39:58.200]  people in now outfits the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media
[39:58.200 --> 40:04.560]  and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression fact we're already
[40:04.560 --> 40:09.080]  into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical
[40:09.080 --> 40:15.280]  to understand that the longer the shutdown persist the worse it's going to be a month
[40:15.280 --> 40:20.880]  of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy
[40:20.880 --> 40:25.000]  that's what we always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self sufficient
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.160]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control
[40:30.160 --> 40:36.200]  they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades
[40:36.200 --> 40:41.160]  in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen because we're following
[40:41.160 --> 40:46.280]  the globalist blueprint and their battle plan and yes it's just hope it and yes it's scary
[40:46.280 --> 40:50.960]  but denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.960]  stop the denial and realize what's really happening I've hunted a lot of big game at
[40:55.960 --> 41:01.480]  long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say six hundred
[41:01.480 --> 41:07.160]  yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll still run fifty sixty seventy maybe
[41:07.160 --> 41:12.760]  a hundred yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through
[41:12.760 --> 41:17.280]  their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened they fall
[41:17.280 --> 41:23.160]  over and they die then you go back and haul them back in well that's what's going to
[41:23.160 --> 41:29.200]  happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've
[41:29.200 --> 41:34.440]  been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long horrible
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.720]  depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[41:38.720 --> 41:42.000]  a hundred million dead according to the UN and I believe their numbers because it's
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.440]  the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so to all the leftists that
[41:47.440 --> 41:50.720]  thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you
[41:50.720 --> 41:56.680]  bought into something bigger than what Hitler did one of the best nutrients nature has provided

[43:03.040 --> 43:08.560]  yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're into pedophilia yeah we're into world
[43:08.560 --> 43:15.640]  government yeah you're obsolete you are non-essential we are shutting your ass down yeah we told
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.840]  you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore you're
[43:19.840 --> 43:24.800]  gonna be the service economy and now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service
[43:24.800 --> 43:30.000]  economy and you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance

[43:40.520 --> 43:45.480]  understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you
[43:45.480 --> 43:50.880]  still can now is the time for action now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul
[43:50.880 --> 44:18.200]  Revere's you know you are you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:18.200 --> 44:34.280]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[44:34.280 --> 44:37.880]  all right folks let me tell you what we're gonna be breaking let me start the next hour
[44:37.880 --> 44:44.120]  in the video we're gonna be playing for you it's just went live on info wars dot com it's
[44:44.120 --> 44:52.080]  the top story on the site we're gonna pull that up and we're going to put that on screen
[44:52.080 --> 44:59.800]  for TV viewers and radio listeners here in just a moment video George Floyd tried to
[44:59.800 --> 45:08.320]  hide white powder during arrest this bombshell reveal corroborates corners report of Floyd
[45:08.320 --> 45:16.360]  dying of a heart attack and not asphyxiation and having a panic attack that caused him
[45:16.360 --> 45:22.040]  to die I still think that the Minnesota training is wrong one of the few Minneapolis St. Paul
[45:22.040 --> 45:26.760]  has training both cities do have choke holds that were banned in the late 80s by the LAPD
[45:26.760 --> 45:30.840]  because they did cause some deaths particularly in patients that were on cocaine or methamphetamine
[45:30.840 --> 45:35.720]  we're gonna be playing you that exclusive video that they released this is on ABC news
[45:35.720 --> 45:48.240]  you name it and you can see that he is dropping a baggie of white powder looks like cocaine
[45:48.240 --> 45:58.120]  methamphetamine MDMA fat little baggie that just went live on info wars dot com I still
[45:58.120 --> 46:01.920]  don't like the fact that he's got his knee on his crowded artery normally you have to
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.600]  hit both to kill somebody but it could it could definitely cause me to panic and have
[46:06.600 --> 46:12.280]  a heart attack now he knew both the police officers he made porn movies these these
[46:12.280 --> 46:17.720]  cops worked at this nightclub with him in security the whole thing really is shady and
[46:17.720 --> 46:24.200]  now you add this to it it's a big deal we're gonna air that footage and cover all that
[46:24.200 --> 46:33.760]  when we start the next hour and again it's not legitimizing this poor guy dying the media
[46:33.760 --> 46:38.680]  has seized on this event though to say that all the police and all white people deserve
[46:38.680 --> 46:43.240]  to have problems and black folks didn't even buy into this until the white liberals went
[46:43.240 --> 46:48.240]  out and you go to these events and I watch videos around the country and it's 90% white
[46:48.240 --> 46:57.040]  people and again I'm not demonizing white people but it's a giant manipulation ok let
[46:57.040 --> 47:03.080]  me do this that big story just broke on info wars dot com a global exclusive another big
[47:03.080 --> 47:06.720]  exclusive yesterday I'm up here reviewing footage and I go hey guys you know that's
[47:06.720 --> 47:12.160]  pretty powerful that antifa is burning down the homeless camp you'll want to put that
[47:12.160 --> 47:20.480]  footage up and they put a short clip of one guy having his stuff burned out we've got
[47:20.480 --> 47:25.480]  three different camera angles in 20 minutes we were at the homeless camp while Andy was
[47:25.480 --> 47:31.440]  just burning everything and people are begging him and he was punching him in the face and
[47:31.440 --> 47:36.000]  so Twitter really screwed up the left really screwed up when they said we attacked the
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.880]  homeless man we burned his bed we staged that you really screwed up we've got all the
[47:41.880 --> 47:47.440]  angles it slowed down and we've got you guys burning the homeless camp and again we have
[47:47.440 --> 47:52.720]  our own media platform with millions of people visiting a day so you can't just lie about
[47:52.720 --> 48:01.880]  us all day long imagine the media is saying my camera guy Zach who shot this footage is
[48:01.880 --> 48:06.360]  the guy that was burning people's mattresses because they burn it and then run away from
[48:06.360 --> 48:10.120]  the guy and then he runs up and starts yelling at the line of people who my camera guy's
[48:10.120 --> 48:14.480]  in the front of because he sees everybody's protesters that have come to his house where
[48:14.480 --> 48:19.560]  he lives under a bridge in downtown Austin so he runs up to my camera guy after they
[48:19.560 --> 48:25.040]  burn his stuff 50 yards away they all run off and they come over and get in his face
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.160]  and again this isn't about infor wars it's about the lies of the left Jack Dorsey had
[48:29.160 --> 48:35.760]  this pin to the top of Twitter top story today Alex Jones caught burning up homeless camp
[48:35.760 --> 48:47.840]  all because the homeless guy runs over to my camera guy who was the only person left
[48:47.840 --> 48:54.160]  from the group that ran off because he was there covering we're gonna air all that raw
[48:54.160 --> 49:00.000]  footage coming up next hour when Savannah Hernandez and Zach the camera guy join us
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.120]  in studio the evil criminals that have committed all these crimes I said this segment I had
[49:06.120 --> 49:10.000]  a message to Trump and a message to the Pentagon and a message to everybody else and I do intend
[49:10.000 --> 49:18.280]  to get to it let me have a gun shop owner that's a good friend of mine who had his shop
[49:18.280 --> 49:26.200]  broken into last night oh and I just don't think to tell you by the way he's black and
[49:26.200 --> 49:30.400]  I'm not gonna let this one's about what color somebody is I just thought oh they're trying
[49:30.400 --> 49:35.360]  to steal guns and then now Fox News is calling oh we got a black shop owner being attacked
[49:35.360 --> 49:44.880]  so Cargill's gonna be in studio with us coming up but this George Floyd tried to hide white
[49:44.880 --> 49:52.440]  powder during a rest I've gone and watch the porno movie he's in and I've gone and researched
[49:52.440 --> 49:57.680]  him and you know he was bombed out of his brain all the time on drugs and alcohol and
[49:57.680 --> 50:06.360]  he knew the two cops he worked with one of them at the nightclub and the whole thing's
[50:06.360 --> 50:11.600]  very suspicious and I think excessive force was used and I'm not happy the guy's dead
[50:11.600 --> 50:18.920]  I'm but but the media is seizing on this and covering this up CBS NBC all of them have
[50:18.920 --> 50:25.000]  that have have released as of yesterday the surveillance footage this is all over the internet
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.480]  no one noticed bigger than Dallas bigger than LA bigger than Chicago I mean bigger than
[50:31.480 --> 50:38.200]  Godzilla's brass balls because I went and checked multiple original footage that was
[50:38.200 --> 50:42.920]  released because I didn't want to put something out somebody doctor and it's it's him man
[50:42.920 --> 50:48.560]  with a bag of drugs and my point is he doesn't deserve to die of that but he could have died
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.960]  of that because you can you can cause brain damage shutting down one side of the crowded
[50:53.960 --> 50:58.880]  arteries you got to do both sides and normally kill somebody but it's still a bad move by
[50:58.880 --> 51:05.320]  the police and when I found out that it was their training nobody in the United States
[51:05.320 --> 51:09.680]  teaches this stuff this is MMA stuff that the police used to do a long time ago that
[51:09.680 --> 51:14.800]  they stopped doing so many deaths so I'm not defending it and the cops been charged but
[51:14.800 --> 51:23.600]  everything you see is about this America is in a low ebb shaken by multiple blows and
[51:23.600 --> 51:29.920]  Trump adds to the distress they want you to moralize they want the country collapsed because
[51:29.920 --> 51:33.680]  the globalist picked China to be dominant into the future and America to be done and
[51:33.680 --> 51:37.760]  we've pretty much gone to second place until Trump got in and like a race car driver he
[51:37.760 --> 51:42.320]  took us back into first place people say well who cares if we're first if China wasn't an
[51:42.320 --> 51:46.000]  authoritarian state it wouldn't matter if the United States wasn't first they're the
[51:46.000 --> 51:52.920]  worst state on earth killed way more than Hitler installing and combine and it's it's
[51:52.920 --> 51:58.040]  it's it's they're taking us over it's a cancerous authoritarian regime so I'll tell you what
[51:58.040 --> 52:06.160]  I'll do Savannah and Zach are coming in here at 15 after then we got Cargill and Owen Cargill
[52:06.160 --> 52:11.800]  and Shroyer in studio and I do want to open the phones up some too but I'll do my message
[52:11.800 --> 52:18.840]  on the big picture when we start at six after and I will do it it will happen I'll be completely
[52:18.840 --> 52:23.120]  frank with you people can notice sometimes even around here why my wife's like man you
[52:23.120 --> 52:26.840]  sleep a lot more than you used to and like I've always had this incredible energy and
[52:26.840 --> 52:30.960]  I do the problem is now my understanding is so much greater that now when I look at a
[52:30.960 --> 52:37.680]  problem it connects to everything and it's exhausting to say hey I've got a message for
[52:37.680 --> 52:41.920]  the president and the Pentagon because I know they got some smart people in there but they
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.640]  need folks to really cut through it all and admit really where we're at and I know people
[52:45.640 --> 52:51.040]  listen to me and it's stressful to know that I know all this stuff and I live this stuff
[52:51.040 --> 52:55.560]  and I know what's coming next and then just to open my brain up and look at all the angles
[52:55.560 --> 53:01.440]  of this I'm just like you man I want to run away and hide I don't want to do this I don't
[53:01.440 --> 53:06.200]  want to fight these people I didn't want to go downtown yesterday and have thousands
[53:06.200 --> 53:10.040]  of white liberals say we're gonna murder you we're gonna kill you f your family you don't
[53:10.040 --> 53:14.200]  have your children we're gonna put you in prison we're gonna shoot you we're gonna we're gonna
[53:14.200 --> 53:19.560]  put you in a camp because I couldn't believe all the sacks of garbage just the filth the
[53:19.560 --> 53:23.120]  dumbness that I mean we were driving back to the office and the crew and the security
[53:23.120 --> 53:30.920]  guys are like man this is who lives in our city this is who we're around it's shameful
[53:30.920 --> 53:35.560]  and all the videos I've watched of anti for beating up women and children and stabbing
[53:35.560 --> 53:39.480]  police in the neck and shooting and killing federal security guards whose names you don't
[53:39.480 --> 53:44.480]  even know because the media is a footnote all these dead beaten people all these businesses
[53:44.480 --> 53:50.200]  burned down all this crap had nothing to do with anything all injustice and nobody even
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.000]  knows these people's names because they don't matter because it's all George Floyd who was
[53:55.000 --> 54:04.320]  a drunken drug addict security thug who obviously had the MO of a drug dealer and I'm not glad
[54:04.320 --> 54:13.040]  he's dead but why would the cops do something like this well it turns out they knew him
[54:13.040 --> 54:17.880]  and they had disregard for him because I bet you money they worked with him or probably
[54:17.880 --> 54:22.600]  his bosses corrupt police is what I smell I think you all smell it too and everybody
[54:22.600 --> 54:27.000]  else I talked to in law enforcement goes as well so yeah a bunch of thug cops another
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.160]  thug what do you expect is gonna happen thugs act like thugs we're gonna go to break please
[54:31.160 --> 54:35.000]  don't forget we got the biggest mega cell going of the year 60% off black cell it's

[54:45.600 --> 54:52.760]  end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of everything
[54:52.760 --> 55:00.360]  that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen because
[55:00.360 --> 55:07.480]  it was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children never growing
[55:07.480 --> 55:13.720]  up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the
[55:13.720 --> 55:18.440]  history book show us just like the bible states every time Israel became corrupt evil and
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.720]  turned away from God they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to
[55:24.720 --> 55:30.200]  special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating
[55:30.200 --> 55:37.320]  that again today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage
[55:37.320 --> 55:41.960]  info wars has decided to fight for freedom info wars had great victory thanks to your
[55:41.960 --> 55:48.920]  support and your prayers memorial day is here it's one of the biggest sales of the year

[57:27.800 --> 57:35.880]  like purpose of humanity will and I hate how all these stupid attempted race riots funded
[57:35.880 --> 57:46.160]  by a bunch of demonic method white people are obscuring the fact that the falcon nine
[57:46.160 --> 57:50.760]  heavy lifter bigger than the Russians bigger than anything anybody ever imagined the heaviest
[57:50.760 --> 58:00.160]  lifter by far it was victorious and heavy lifted that giant payload into orbit that
[58:00.160 --> 58:10.480]  just puts another big check in Elon Musk not being a fraud
[58:10.480 --> 58:14.440]  Sam one of our other great camera people did some great interviews and breakdowns here
[58:14.440 --> 58:18.200]  here's a few minute boil down he just did and then I'm going to come back and try to
[58:18.200 --> 58:24.240]  address what's coming next and I really don't want to say this I don't enjoy saying alarmist
[58:24.240 --> 58:32.160]  things like this but I think everybody's figured out by now that I don't just say alarmist stuff
[58:32.160 --> 58:41.960]  to say it and I have so much not even anxiety but pain pain when I think about what's coming
[58:41.960 --> 58:46.760]  next to this country and I feel like a failure quite frankly people keep saying oh you're
[58:46.760 --> 58:54.960]  just a great job everything you said's coming true it's like like your grandpa gets cancer
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.920]  and they're going to die and they die and you feel good about that I don't feel good
[58:56.920 --> 59:08.600]  about this I feel sick I feel sick I don't take any pleasure thinking about how sorrows
[59:08.600 --> 59:12.360]  in the new world order they're all going to get it they're not going to get away with
[59:12.360 --> 59:16.120]  this but it doesn't matter they're already going to hell they're already sacks of crap
[59:16.120 --> 59:20.960]  there's no victory in the fact we're going to beat them except we got them off our back
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.600]  I mean I guess there is a victory to it I just it's so stupid to act like this and to go
[59:26.600 --> 59:33.520]  down this road let's let's let's go to Sam's report and then I'm going to come back and
[59:33.520 --> 59:39.880]  I'll I'll address the big picture please stay with us yeah man of course like it's our city
[59:39.880 --> 59:44.560]  so it's like why would we want to trash our own city you know like I get the whole message
[59:44.560 --> 59:48.880]  and everything but if this is just chaotic at this point you know like we're hurting
[59:48.880 --> 59:52.720]  each other by hurting each other's businesses here right you know so it's kind of pointless
[59:52.720 --> 59:57.840]  destroying each other's cars if we're getting the message out you know right on do you feel
[59:57.840 --> 1:00:01.960]  like maybe this is an effective way right now I don't know man it's like the opposite
[1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:05.560]  you know it just gives it like a whole bad view instead of us being peaceful you know
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:09.960]  lined up on a sidewalk you know holding hands or you know another kind of idea but this
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:13.160]  isn't the right way like violence is never the answer and it's kind of turned violent
[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:17.040]  at this point because we're getting in front of others lives you know by running into cars
[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:22.000]  and like so yeah I heard there was a car that was on fire somewhere that's that's pointless
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.560]  and meaningless and like you know maybe this person worked like three jobs to get like
[1:00:25.560 --> 1:00:29.520]  their car payments down you know so it's like yeah we're hurting more than causing
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:35.000]  we're good I moved from Miami and I've only been here for like less than two years but
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:40.520]  like all of this is like like these people just want to go back to their families and
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:47.480]  they're just like us they care but it happened over there not here so all of this is just
[1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:51.560]  pretty unnecessary like I said we could have lined up on the sidewalks and I just got here
[1:00:51.560 --> 1:00:56.960]  I just got off work I work at like St. Medical Center so it's like all of this is just like
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:01.840]  noise it's there's no meaning behind it like sure it's it's loud noise but it's like look
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:04.760]  how chaotic this is like people are trying to get home people are trying to leave Austin
[1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:09.440]  but we won't let them and I did it if there were to be peaceful sidewalks lined up and
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:14.400]  wow you know just imagine like they're so peaceful and so tranquil and like so quiet
[1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:18.560]  that's loud and that's what speaks louder than all this noise you have any message maybe
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:24.640]  for anyone who might be watching what's happening here tonight I would say like you know the
[1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:31.080]  first step to communism is socialism and that's all I can really say because we don't want
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:36.520]  to fall into these influences and these states of emotion you know when justice is being
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:41.560]  taken and we just have to give it some time while showing support for the families and
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:53.960]  the people who they lost because it's still a broken system that we need to fix the lockdown
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:02:00.480]  is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:07.760]  rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:13.920]  Gates Foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought
[1:02:13.920 --> 1:02:20.760]  off but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post-human world and now that we're
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:28.120]  inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its end game submission to this
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:34.360]  is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:40.640]  a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this this is
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:47.640]  your dignity your soul your future being born inside out this is a scientific dictatorship
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:03:16.120]  to full control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:23.280]  are live my friends we are broadcasting worldwide despite the fact that the forces of evil have
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:29.960]  done everything they can to silence us thanks to you the lone star steel burns brighter
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:39.000]  than ever the north star is alive and only your voice carries the light in the dark frigid
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:46.640]  terror of the night so no one came to defend the 62 million babies we aborted no one came
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:51.560]  to defend when all the old people had their houses taken by the IRS no one came to defend
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:57.480]  while communism was taught the schools and had a files were given attention with our
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:05.760]  children and so now the globalists have tapped on us like we were a piece of fruit or vegetable
[1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:16.560]  a cantaloupe and said I do believe that these people are ripe I do believe all the spoiled
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:22.960]  method trash that we've been breeding and preparing can boil out of their holes train
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:34.960]  in their community colleges run by their harbored high priest to overthrow America
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:42.080]  because there's a score to settle and the globalist want to conquer this nation now
[1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:48.280]  everybody told get in a group and go loot the Louis Vuitton shops of the Nike shops
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:55.240]  they're the useful idiots but we have the footage of the Antifa literal professors out
[1:04:55.240 --> 1:04:59.840]  telling people what to rob what to do directing the black people it's all incredible you talk
[1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:05.560]  about patronization talk about corruption I famously caught the head of handgun control
[1:05:05.560 --> 1:05:12.280]  incorporated for Texas giving black men $400 a piece after they testified that I'm a black
[1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:16.480]  thug and I'm going to kill you if you don't ban the second amendment and I walked outside
[1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:22.880]  he was paying them each the money and the Austin American statesman called me after
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:30.240]  I put that video out before YouTube existed I had to pay $30 something thousand for the
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:38.440]  500 600,000 people that linked to it and downloaded it the NRA linked to it and the statesman
[1:05:38.440 --> 1:05:44.120]  said to me they said are you a racist because if that was a white man paying off white people
[1:05:44.120 --> 1:05:49.080]  would you have talked about it and I said no the racism is hiring black men to go in
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:55.320]  and say yo yo I'm a thug I'm going to kill your white ass if you don't they literally
[1:05:55.320 --> 1:06:03.960]  said this if you don't ban the guns I think you was a black thug for for giving me gun
[1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:07.800]  I mean they literally and then they walk out there like Urkel voice thank you very much
[1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:12.880]  sir for the money and he's like paying him $400 a piece going 100 this little hunchback
[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:18.200]  oh man 200 we got to find that footage somewhere but but that's what I've been through that
[1:06:18.200 --> 1:06:28.920]  was 25 years ago we caught that footage front page of the statesman racist alex jones tries
[1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:36.280]  to frame blacks in payoff video and there was a whole congressional state hearing about
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:40.120]  it and henna hose of the head of the committee got knocked off the committee because of it
[1:06:40.120 --> 1:06:44.920]  because he got caught I mean the democrats are the ones that stage things they're the
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:51.400]  ones that that's why they're the top of twitter today jones caught burning down homeless camp
[1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:55.600]  we've got three different camera angles showing auntie for doing it but that's what they hold
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:01.440]  you staged it you're the homeland character never really watched homeland but it must
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:11.560]  be back because everybody walks up the street their democrats they go f you homeland man
[1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:15.440]  little newsflash I don't need to go burn down homeless camps and if it doesn't I don't need
[1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:19.360]  to go beat up women and if it doesn't I don't need to go stab police the neck and if it
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:26.560]  doesn't I don't need to go rob black businesses and if it doesn't but oh every time they get
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:36.080]  caught or they get declared terrorist oh alex jones he did it his Hispanic and Asian film
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:46.080]  crew did it you know they're white supremacists
[1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:50.760]  info wars did that right there that guy that got almost killed in Dallas I did that I robbed
[1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:55.920]  all the fedex trucks all the amazon trucks I burned down the black businesses myself
[1:07:55.920 --> 1:08:02.240]  in minnesota this is all footage of what info wars did our crew did all this I mean just
[1:08:02.240 --> 1:08:10.480]  watch showtime and homeland I mean they told you and if I never did anything wrong all
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:18.200]  right let's get serious ahead of the guest joining us here's my message I have looked
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:22.680]  at all the angles of this and we've asked what comes after russia gate hoax what comes
[1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:30.320]  after ukraine hoax what comes after all the cabin on me to hoax and the answer is civil
[1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:36.520]  unrest funding riots antifa and soros and all of them in full page ads have told us
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:42.720]  the plan we've covered this at nauseam and when I warned the president about it the
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:50.080]  media attacks me because they know we're over the target so here's here's what you need
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:57.240]  to know let's start at the beginning of the latest hoax when the headline today says german
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:09:01.480]  government confirms covid-19 a hoax it doesn't mean it's not a real virus doesn't mean it's
[1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:05.920]  not a bad demonia but it's the normal amount of deaths every year attributed from other
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:14.760]  things to it and so the german interior ministers own elite panel unanimously put a report out
[1:09:14.760 --> 1:09:20.120]  saying the responses of hoax the deaths are a hoax they're putting people in the column
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:25.920]  that died a gunshot wounds just like here heart attack you name it this is meant to shut down
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:31.680]  the economy and stop political unrest which is happening everywhere and so the more authoritarian
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:37.040]  a country north korea spain germany the more they had a lockdown so the swedes are going
[1:09:37.040 --> 1:09:41.040]  along with the socialism they love it no lockdown they're like hey everybody's accepting the
[1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:48.440]  takeover here no need for a lockdown here baby we're in full control it's anybody trying
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:52.360]  to get loose to the new world order gets the lockdown china's lockdown has been over for
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:10:00.400]  months so german official leaks report announcing covid-19 is a global false alarm close quote
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:06.720]  and it goes on in the report put out by the interior ministry elite scientific advisory
[1:10:06.720 --> 1:10:13.800]  panel the highest panel that the dangers of covid-19 was overestimated the people who
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:19.080]  died from coronavirus essentially those who would statistically die this year no more
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:25.040]  than 250,000 deaths from covid-19 compared to 1.5 million in germany during the influenza
[1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:31.640]  wave the danger obviously no greater than that of any other viruses and they explained
[1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:40.240]  that in germany 1.5 million died in 2017 2018 same thing happened here that was a bad year
[1:10:40.240 --> 1:10:45.360]  the 93 page report titled analysis of the crisis management has been drafted by a scientific
[1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:52.960]  panel appointed by the interior ministry and composed by external medical and composed
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:59.800]  by external medical experts from german universities the report was the initiative of the department
[1:10:59.800 --> 1:11:06.680]  of the interior ministry called unit km4 and in charge of the protection of critical industries
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:12.120]  this is also where the german official turn whistleblower steven cohen worked and from
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:19.480]  where he linked it in the media and it goes on with the report but we're being told by
[1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:28.760]  the UN yahoo finance master here to stay even after covid goes away now why does this tie
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:34.400]  into what's happening they know the covid hoaxes are falling apart they already had
[1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:38.200]  their race riot stuff ready for at the end of the summer august was when their go time
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.360]  was the hottest part all the rest of the people already been locked down they're going to
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:44.680]  be pissed they didn't want things to open up till august remember that with the democrats
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:50.640]  said they they unleash everybody in august you're not locked in your house anymore and
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:56.840]  then they'd use whatever the latest police thing was to go crazy but because the lockdown
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:12:01.800]  started and they went ahead and went with it now because the riots make you forget about
[1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:07.520]  covid and how it was a hoax and now the businesses are locked down the same corporations all
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:13.440]  the big ones lock everything down to create that image that things are still shut down
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:18.520]  then antifa goes attacks all the police departments and federal buildings so they all get encircled
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:24.000]  and then crime can explode further demoralizing people so the general public actually gets
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.200]  freaked out and says yeah trump sucks which is now happening because the crime rate is
[1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:37.040]  just off the bonkers right now so what's about to happen next I'll tell you and then
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:44.840]  our guests will be here what's coming next after this attacks on infrastructure using
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:49.800]  narco terrorist squads controlled by china in the deep state ms-13 controlled by Pelosi
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:57.160]  we're living in insanely dangerous times and I've told folks going back three months
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:01.120]  ago I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the covid-19 virus I'm worried
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:05.920]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:10.320]  has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:14.280]  the united states and it's even worse in the third world so I hope trump with his initiatives
[1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:19.440]  can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the covid-19 all the wars
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:23.760]  and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the time to get storeable

[1:15:37.020 --> 1:15:41.560]  camber people over the last five years and of course vanna hernandez are here in studio
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.240]  to to account for one of the top twitter stories out there that they went and they burned down
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:51.100]  a homeless camp i thought they covered it and showed it but you know how jack dorsi and
[1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:56.000]  twitter operates but let me just finish this statement on where we are and what's about
[1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:02.040]  to unfold here there's a multinational combine of corporations that want to dissolve nation
[1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:05.880]  states and they don't want people involved electing governments that get in the way of
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:10.560]  their larger global plans and they're very authoritarian that's the new order is and
[1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:16.400]  they want to get rid of the people being able to have any say it's that simple so communist
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:22.560]  china is their dream scenario and so they were given one sided trade deals the last
[1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:26.680]  fifty years they were set up as the golden child they were set up to have the new century
[1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:31.440]  the cfr the globalist david rockefeller they all admitted that the un was there to serve
[1:16:31.440 --> 1:16:38.000]  them this was their plan and along comes trump and balsana roe and others saying no to that
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.800]  and in just a few years it all turns around and the communist chinese are no longer in
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:48.840]  charge of everything and so we get russia gay if you're a bunch of globalists that are
[1:16:48.840 --> 1:16:53.800]  traders against the country you don't say we're traders you say hey the trumps with
[1:16:53.800 --> 1:16:59.640]  the russians which is a side group and it's the same thing now so they're financing the
[1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:05.360]  race war they're taking events that happen and they're hyping them up real events some
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:09.840]  of not real events and it's all on record they're doing this so i just want to say what's coming
[1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:21.200]  next and that is going to be things that are going to boggle the mind we know this globalist
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:27.240]  combine controls major narcotics rings much of the mexican mafia to mexico is now under
[1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:31.280]  the control of china because of the fentanyl and the opium being brought in similar to
[1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:34.800]  how two hundred years ago western elites took over china started doing the same thing back
[1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:41.360]  even though america wasn't involved in that and so they are planning and they are preparing
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:49.520]  to attack transformers and infrastructure and the grid and they are planning to attack
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:55.040]  the police so that when there's not essential services criminals feel free to rob which
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:00.400]  then again destroys people's confidence that's why you've got headlines all over the news
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:06.480]  saying america's done we're in a depression it's all over we're showing footage here i
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:16.760]  shot yesterday of people wearing malice uniforms that are out to bring down america this is
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:23.720]  truly sick so it's such a big deal that the german interior minister ministry had a report
[1:18:23.720 --> 1:18:30.880]  that covered response is over driven a hype a power grab but again this this rioting is
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:36.360]  the cover to cover up that last hoax and this rioting will be the distraction for an attempt
[1:18:36.360 --> 1:18:42.000]  to assassinate the president for taking down different power grids so so we're in a very
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:45.640]  very dangerous time and i think the justice department has had its own corruption its
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:50.280]  own issues nothing's perfect needs to understand that taking the gloves off and going up against
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:55.640]  the new world order and taking down the chinese communist networks and going after the leftist
[1:18:55.640 --> 1:19:01.120]  networks and really going after the head of the snake going after the specific mob bosses
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:06.280]  and leaders of this will cause a domino effect and collapse of confidence in the operatives
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:10.720]  beneath them so you can all day sit there and be afraid of the mainstream media that's
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:14.840]  going to come after you when you go after mob bosses but if you actually go after the king
[1:19:14.840 --> 1:19:18.280]  pens in the new world order it'll all collapse like a house of cards and we can turn this
[1:19:18.280 --> 1:19:22.840]  around very quickly if not you can see in the tea leaves the establishment is planning
[1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:29.480]  to go for broke so that's what i wanted to say and that's the next phase of this and
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:33.200]  if they can't get the power grid off if they can't shut down the economy further if they
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:41.400]  can't start a war by invading taiwan or hong kong then the globalist are going to try
[1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:45.400]  to steal the election with mail in ballots we know all of that and i know that people
[1:19:45.400 --> 1:19:49.480]  that are loyal to america and want freedom understand all this but the audience needs
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:53.880]  to know it and people on the fence the government need to know it and i think everybody's figured
[1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:59.960]  out by now that we're not making this stuff up okay this is people that really spend
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:03.960]  their lives our guest our our researchers all of us on what's really happening in the
[1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:14.560]  world and this is a new type of warfare we're all facing okay zack drucker and of course
[1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:20.560]  savannah and as are here before we go to break just in general savannah and then zack what
[1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:24.880]  would you call this period of time we're in right now i would say that it's definitely
[1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:30.480]  definitely a historic turning point for us right now everything that i witnessed is
[1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:34.160]  something that i'm witnessing for the first time in my lifetime and again it's a turning
[1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:38.320]  point because we've gotten to the point now where we've been lied to so much and now our
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:43.120]  whole entire nation is in chaos and people are finally standing up and realizing that
[1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:49.280]  they need to stand up for themselves defend themselves and yeah alex again i haven't done
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:53.840]  as much historical background and research as you have and i don't have that but just what
[1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:58.960]  i'm seeing now is insane to me and no but your view just a snapshot as an american about
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:04.400]  this is historic yes it is this is a real game changing time it's a turning point it really is
[1:21:04.400 --> 1:21:08.800]  especially after all of this covet nineteen on cents and everyone is waking up to and seeing
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:13.440]  that this is this is all a hoax we've all been lied to there are thousands and thousands of
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:18.800]  people in the streets in every single city and where all where's the mainstream media calling
[1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:22.720]  them disease spreaders where's the mainstream media saying that they're biological terrorists
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:26.240]  they're nowhere to be found exactly you leave your house you're a terrorist but oh they're
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:30.960]  communists they're burning down homeless camps they're good and that's okay exactly it's
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:37.040]  complete mayhem complete chaos and i don't know where we go from here but people are definitely
[1:21:37.040 --> 1:21:42.240]  waking up and starting to realize that they need to start utilizing their their second amendment
[1:21:42.240 --> 1:21:46.160]  and they need to utilize their first amendment as well and both of those things need to be protected
[1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:51.200]  and the american people are going to start doing that themselves and we've got a lot of footage of
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:57.680]  that coming up as well zack you have been we've all been accused but you particularly did you
[1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:03.440]  know you burned out a homeless camp apparently yeah that apparently all it takes is me to just
[1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:08.480]  look at the homeless camp in order for me to let it on fire so it actually just burst into flames
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:16.000]  as soon as we started recording exactly um so i mean honestly i think overall that something's
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:22.320]  going on um and i think the media is doing a really really really really giant job of going after
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:27.840]  all these events all this stuff and kind of pushing a giant narrative to kind of rile people up
[1:22:27.840 --> 1:22:34.000]  um i went down there on it honestly kind of on a whim we were all thinking about it i ended up meeting
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.160]  up with i was telling savannah don't go down there yeah savannah was i was actually surprised
[1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:42.800]  to see zack i like turned around and he was there i wasn't expecting you to be there at all yeah it
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:46.560]  was one of those things where i was actually gonna meet up with a couple of you showed up with gasoline
[1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:54.560]  and burn everything down yeah so i mean in a nutshell we were out i came around we saw a bunch
[1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:58.240]  of different bits of footage i actually have a whole gopro i recorded the whole thing so even
[1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:02.160]  though i have hd more cinematic footage i record everything on the and we've got it coming up we're
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:06.160]  not gonna tell people that you and savannah didn't burn down the homeless camp yeah so we're
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:10.880]  gonna show people who did it so we ended up walking up to the homeless camp uh as you see here
[1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:15.680]  i've got footage of the guy this guy with the hat here actually you can see it now it's zoomed in i
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:20.160]  slowed it down and this is my gopro footage you can see the hat the guy i we have no idea who this
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.040]  guy is first off um stay right there we're gonna come back if radio listeners will narrate this but
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.920]  the national media claims because we exposed anti for burning down a homeless camp that we did it
[1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:35.520]  and okay and that zack did it so we're gonna play all the footage we're all coming up we have the
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:41.200]  exclusive george floyd video i mean they they officially put out the squad car and then the
[1:23:41.200 --> 1:23:45.040]  surveillance footage but it shows him dropping this white bag of what looks like methamphetamine
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:51.920]  or cocaine that's on info wars dot com as well stay with us the united states is not communist china
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:57.520]  we don't have three million people in concentration camps we don't blow up churches we don't kill
[1:23:57.520 --> 1:24:02.640]  political dissidents and sell their organs but all over the news we see the un available
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:10.000]  indicates who mainstream corporate media praising communist china for their response and if communist
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.640]  china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling
[1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:19.680]  people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like san Antonio pass laws saying
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:25.120]  will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's calling it the european
[1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:31.360]  virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose big time because we
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.240]  the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab the
[1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:42.160]  resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:49.200]  censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker now it's official
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:55.520]  the united nations came out yesterday and said the covet emergency will last five years and the u k
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:00.960]  government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:06.720]  track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of ten people that you visit and
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:12.800]  if you go outside that list of ten you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:17.840]  this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters
[1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:24.240]  the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.000]  it was clear the globalist art authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:36.560]  straightjacket on us before they carry out their in game which is global depopulation so you see
[1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:43.840]  submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:49.920]  they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die i don't like coming to you every day on the radio
[1:25:49.920 --> 1:25:54.160]  and tv stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things
[1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:59.120]  but you notice almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:05.360]  everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.520]  if you have little kids because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:13.840]  people don't listen they go out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is
[1:26:13.840 --> 1:26:19.280]  the death of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century warfare
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:24.800]  carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to
[1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:29.440]  save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can
[1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:35.760]  dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was talking
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:41.680]  about it 25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.400]  the case but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:27:02.320]  got to stop them you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:19.360]  here is the original footage that last time i checked had 14 million views on one channel
[1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:25.520]  10 million on another 5 million on another of footage i'm up here yesterday in the morning
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.680]  reviewing raw footage i said hey them burning down the homeless people stuff's pretty viral
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:37.360]  why don't you put that on on twitter so they put it out and it goes viral and a day later it's got
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:43.520]  20 million views or more and so they start saying oh because the homeless guy runs up to zack everybody
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:47.920]  else runs away and he's just yelling how dare you do this he sees him as another protester
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:52.640]  and the media says that's us but you can see in the footage the people running up with the
[1:27:52.640 --> 1:27:57.280]  stuff burning it but turns out savannah and the rest of the crew had shot antifa burning more of
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:02.000]  the homeless camp so we're going to show you that exclusive footage here in a moment but here's the
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:27.920]  raw super viral video
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:37.840]  yeah those are supposed to be believed out but but maybe that that last f bomb got out there but
[1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:40.800]  it's okay the democrats can cuss on all their channels we're just not supposed to be cuss on
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:45.120]  ours so so savannah you guys are being shot with rubber bullets while this is happening everybody
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:51.440]  else has run away from the guy that's why they came over to zack yes so drew greg and i were trying
[1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:55.840]  to make our way over to the situation see what was happening and we were getting shot by rubber
[1:28:55.840 --> 1:29:00.640]  bullets so we ended up having to retreat and zack got this footage but i went over there directly
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:04.800]  after that after everything kind of cleared out and he was also screaming at my camera too he was
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:08.880]  screaming at all of the cameras anyone he could to get his message across of you know why are you
[1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:13.520]  doing this why are you burning down my home and my footage the audio was corrupted but i did find
[1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:18.160]  another clip of it but the guy this homeless man he was screaming in support of the apd he was saying
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:22.960]  the police are the ones that keep us safe you people get out of here you're burning down my home
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:27.040]  and i was asking a lot of people as well are you guys from austin are you from the city and they
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:30.800]  were saying no sure so he was yelling at us because you were the only ones that didn't run away
[1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:34.640]  exactly and he was the only like we were the only ones who would get his message across and he knew
[1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:39.680]  that and that's why he was going up to any camera he could see and saying his message by the way
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:46.400]  before we go to drew's angle of this and and greg's angle of this and and and the video before
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:51.520]  showing antifa grabbing their stuff bringing it over let's go to savannah 10 minutes before up on
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:56.560]  i-35 the highway shut down and this white dude comes up nicely and says i support black lives
[1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:02.240]  matter but let me please cross he gets cold cock loses his glasses you bow up and stand up to these
[1:30:02.240 --> 1:30:22.480]  guys we're gonna play this clip right now here it is so the white nerd walks up and says i worship
[1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:26.720]  you because you're black i'm sorry i'm white can i just please not shut the highway down and the
[1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:32.800]  guys beat him up and they keep beating him now he's trying to find his glasses will the beat
[1:30:32.800 --> 1:30:36.800]  now imagine if the national news was showing this we have hundreds of attacks black on white
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:43.440]  we could show you women being beat up uh old people now savannah sees this and stands up to him
[1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:47.680]  think about this a female reporter stands up to what like a six foot three thug
[1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:52.960]  look like six five six seven how big was that guy
[1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:57.920]  he was tall he was pretty tall the NBA player you're not short
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:03.920]  well he may be an NBA player but his punches aren't that good
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:09.120]  but still he's punching the guy hard as he looks like he's canned for no reason so little
[1:31:09.120 --> 1:31:13.280]  and you interviewed the white nerd he's like i worship you i'm white i'm bad i love you here
[1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:19.840]  my master oh please oh slave die it's like you want to comment on this man i'm just so upset at
[1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:25.520]  the state of our world right now that we keep pulling out our phones and watching our fellow
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:30.240]  americans get attacked i don't give a damn about your political party if i see someone getting punched
[1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:35.040]  like that it is not in my nature and it should be in nobody's nature to stand by and watch this
[1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:39.760]  happen and it's disgusting to me that info wars is being blamed right now for the fact that the
[1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:45.120]  homeless people their camps are getting burned down when info wars was the only people who stood up
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:51.040]  for those that were getting beaten out there nobody else stood up but i did and i'm a part of info
[1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:55.040]  wars so there you go what do you want to say to the democrats saying you burned that place down
[1:31:55.040 --> 1:31:57.840]  you know we're gonna sue them right they're laughing i threaten to sue them they're laughing
[1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:02.560]  on sue me sue me eff you i can't wait for you to see them alex because again who's over there
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:08.080]  standing up for what's right no one out there except for info wars we were the ones out there
[1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:14.240]  for 12 hours trying to get the exam people's message across that it's okay yeah you know what alex i
[1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:18.800]  interviewed a black business owner and she goes it's fine if these looters and rioters burn down my
[1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:23.360]  small business because i understand the cause this is the mentality of these people and it's
[1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:27.760]  disgusting and i stayed out there for 12 hours to get this footage and get these people's message
[1:32:27.760 --> 1:32:32.080]  across and we can't even play this because he's like if he's like if you bitch i'm exactly and i
[1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:36.560]  was i was fully ready to get punched in the face alex but he didn't punch me in the face and i got
[1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:41.200]  lucky in this circumstance but these looters and rioters are taking over our country and everyone
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:45.680]  is just standing by while their fellow american gets attacked and it's disgusting this business
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:51.200]  woman this female business owner just got freaking attacked by plywood and someone stood there and
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:57.600]  took that video why the hell are people not standing up for what's going on wow i'm glad
[1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:02.080]  syphanna was hard to get on air she wanted to be a video editor a few years ago but now now
[1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:08.000]  i'm done alex this is like i'm trying so hard not to to curse but i'm so disappointed by my
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:13.120]  fellow americans right now and i'm so disappointed by gun owners who aren't standing up right now
[1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:17.440]  and going out to these cities and offending themselves but not only are they not standing
[1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:22.160]  up they're saying you and zack burned down a homeless camp yeah that twitter put that to the
[1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:27.760]  top i mean they have no shame zack yeah i mean and the worst part about it is that we go out there
[1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.000]  strictly to just cover it we will all we want to just want to burn it down we want to we want to see
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:36.240]  what's going on yeah and that's the problem is that is that it turns into this thing where
[1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:40.800]  where on my holy my main concern about the whole thing was that the fact it was just
[1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:45.600]  everybody there was doing it because it was cool it was because it was everyone was taking
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:49.600]  selfies thing it was the pop they were burning down the cars and taking selfies i have yeah
[1:33:49.600 --> 1:33:54.640]  i have videos of this girl like getting down getting selfie shots with the fire behind her back
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:59.280]  yeah it's like madness and and so that's the thing that i wanted to see i wanted to see
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:04.000]  how far people would go and how far when the camera is in front of them what's going to happen so
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:10.400]  when i show up and see the car getting smashed a moment i pulled up they got more hyped up about
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:14.960]  it and that was the whole thing was it that's the thing how the left celebrates violence against
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:18.800]  innocent people and then when they get caught burning down a homeless camp we have that footage
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:24.080]  coming up they point at you and say you did it they won't even take responsibility for what
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.880]  they're doing elix and you know what else i was there earlier look here's palace of bricks set out
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:33.440]  and then tea fucks kept coming up to me and calling me and all the epis got to do is get the
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:37.040]  surveillance footage who delivered that you find out who made the order you arrest them right there
[1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:41.120]  sorry go ahead no so and this is what ntifa does they kept coming up to me throughout the day i
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:44.800]  wasn't really doing interviews because i didn't want to get attacked and mob and tifa kept coming
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:49.760]  up to me all day and calling me an agitator and trying to start stuff and i said no and this this
[1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.760]  group of people ended up mobbing me and i talked them down and i said i'm here to get your story
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:58.480]  across please continue with your protest but ntifa is the one that was following me around and trying
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:03.280]  to agitate these people and make them violent this is ntifa let's be clear it's all a bunch
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:06.880]  of white methods and nothing against white people but it literally they're what's and he was like
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:11.760]  nine percent white right all i saw was white people who were attacking me yet at the at these
[1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:16.560]  rallies and protests except for that black guy i mean he didn't attack me but obviously yeah well
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:21.680]  he was the guy they manipulated into this it's ridiculous it's we need to stand i'm not lionizing
[1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:26.000]  white people i understand what we saw i mean i mean i mean uh even the black don't worry you're
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.440]  gonna have the floor keep going here i'm sorry no it's so fun i was just even saying uh we're
[1:35:29.440 --> 1:35:32.880]  ever at the blockade right before that kid got punched in the face and they were trying to
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:38.000]  like catch us on fire that started with a white father and his young little kid yeah it was like
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.880]  10 years old what happened 11 years old you can see it i have a on my my hd compilation b-roll you

[1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:08.080]  start with a couple it'll start on unfortunately with a couple of white people trying to get the
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:13.280]  party started and then everyone gets riled up and then next thing you know you've got cars on fire
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:17.680]  you've got and i guarantee that guy's an academic i bet he's an acc professor yeah the funniest part
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:21.360]  like the little the the car got smashed look at this look at this homeless woman's asleep while
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:27.920]  they're burning her house yep it's just a mess and it's crazy and when that guy screamed in front
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:32.960]  of my face it was it shook me to the core and i mean at the end of the day like he was mad at
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:36.640]  everybody and i was the only one who stood there and watched the whole thing and that's why i got
[1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:43.120]  screamed at that people wanted and now twitter jack dorsi says you did it jack you burned it down
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:50.240]  jack jack attacked it he didn't folks it took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization
[1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:56.880]  to build up the world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as
[1:36:56.880 --> 1:37:01.920]  this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence to the third world
[1:37:01.920 --> 1:37:07.200]  and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and that the general public is going to go
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:13.200]  into deep deep debt to the mega banks they're not going to have medical ID cards forced inoculations we
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:21.840]  are now in a giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:26.720]  place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights rediscover our
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:32.800]  constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:38.080]  shut your business down shut your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already

[1:38:54.480 --> 1:39:00.080]  maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host at info wars or the researchers or the
[1:39:00.080 --> 1:39:05.680]  journalist it's you the listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the arena and
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:11.280]  it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special
[1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:16.480]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:21.360]  the real state of the world not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the council
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:26.560]  on fine relations the boulder burden group the debuts group and other clubs we're pushing
[1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:33.840]  for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans poor humans by humans
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:39.040]  not a world where the establishment hate themselves protect their hate onto us and decide
[1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.160]  we're gonna have a post human world i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:50.080]  and i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god i'm always excited about info wars
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:53.920]  live products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they fund the info
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:00.000]  war in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:09.200]  development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential
[1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:16.640]  oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:23.200]  bunch of thick gross you go but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i like
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:28.320]  to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it right
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:34.400]  in your eyes but i just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well so this
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:38.560]  is a real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:44.080]  that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:45.840]  this is a big winner
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:53.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:40:53.680 --> 1:41:03.280]  this is the end
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:14.320]  all right so savannah hernandez is here we got zack over here who's on fire
[1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:19.280]  and what's crazy is we've got the raw footage for radio listeners will just hear the audio for
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:23.760]  tb viewers we always forget the tb viewers actually a small part of who we are that's
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:26.800]  why they thought they could take us off air but we had hundreds of radio stations that's the main
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:32.160]  audience but radio listeners we have live feeds them for wars dot com forward slash job we have
[1:41:32.160 --> 1:41:37.200]  banned our video you got to see this because if anybody knows anything about this place we've got
[1:41:38.720 --> 1:41:42.800]  the luck of the irish and a lot more and god's on our side the forces with us but
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:47.680]  when it comes to calculation and pre-planning it's not going on around here and it's just
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:52.160]  seed of your pants getting the job done and to see this morning i woke up at like you know
[1:41:52.160 --> 1:41:59.680]  345 the morning by 6 a.m i'm getting media calling did you stage it it's all it would say like did
[1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:05.280]  you did you burn them and i'm like and all of a sudden i'm like find out top of twitter that you
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:10.320]  guys are burning down homeless camps even though you can watch the footage we put out you see the
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:14.880]  antefer running over with the mattresses grabbing it but then i learned you guys had more footage
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:21.680]  what is it like that to be blamed with a crime of attacking homeless people by anti for sympathizers
[1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:26.800]  that are bragging all over the news it's time to burn everything down well honestly it's really been
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:33.360]  it's been surreal because it's been fast and the first thing i had to do was realize that i mean
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:38.240]  the only way i'm going to ever deal with the situation is to pull and come through the footage
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.440]  so just like i found the fact that they guys that started the mattress fire are sitting there
[1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:47.760]  hanging out watching the fire beforehand and there they are hanging out um and this is the
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:51.840]  type of stuff by the way i was focused on this exactly describe it we're going to roll the footage
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:56.720]  that clears your name please continue yeah so in a nutshell i mean listen i've been working here
[1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:02.880]  for a long time ever since 2016 um politically i've always stayed the same i've been with the
[1:43:02.880 --> 1:43:07.760]  same girl this entire time i seem pretty neutral they're very neutral i'm very unbiased i try to
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:12.480]  keep journalistic integrity the best i can you know you get the deal with a lot of different
[1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:16.800]  topics and things but yeah we're not a cult you don't agree with a lot of stuff and yeah exactly
[1:43:16.800 --> 1:43:20.800]  i mean it's it's about an open debate it's about getting the actual information that's like the
[1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:27.440]  whole point and that's why we're out there and so to see this happen and to see that it was going
[1:43:27.440 --> 1:43:32.800]  to get swung the other way is not something i'm not used to you know between friends i've lost
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:37.680]  over social media that have no idea who i am and just assume that just because i work here
[1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:42.560]  that it's just an immediate nail in the coffin people just don't understand and so that's why
[1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:46.880]  i knew that i just needed to be focused on making sure that people saw what really happened
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:53.280]  and so this footage shows you know this is me walking up uh raw gopro right here you can see
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:58.160]  that this is us basically approaching the fire as it was lit this is in the homeless camp for
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:02.880]  radio listeners under i-35 at 7th street yep right next to the police station and you can see
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:06.560]  well you can't really see it's dark back here but in the back corner right behind right in front
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:11.840]  of where this guy in the gray shirt is is actually the four guys that threw the mattress on top later
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:15.840]  on you can see more of the homeless camp just right there yep and the gentleman the homeless
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:20.000]  gentleman that actually is really upset about the whole thing uh you'll see when this cameraman
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:23.920]  goes by so they're already burning part of it and they need some more fuel so they start grabbing
[1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:28.320]  the homeless camp and it's actually because he's upset curious he's upset he's like here he comes
[1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:33.360]  he comes in he's mad the first time this is the first time i capture him being really so he tries
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:37.760]  to stop them burning down his stuff yep and then i have a zoomed in shot at him just pointing at all
[1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:42.160]  the protesters right now saying screw you get out of here it's my house because if you want to battle
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:48.640]  the elite you don't burn down homeless people this is not the castle exactly and and so i mean
[1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:53.600]  that this is so dramatic footage it's crazy and it was so where do you get his mattress and burn it
[1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:58.160]  because you know twitter said you did so yeah so and this is me walking away from the whole situation
[1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:02.800]  and just trying to talk to meanwhile rubber bullets are being fired right yeah well this is prior to
[1:45:02.800 --> 1:45:07.520]  that so this is just prior about a minute or so i walked away uh you can add a little bit audio
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:12.640]  here while he talks but um yeah and it's just this is just raw audio just the crowd yelling and
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:17.840]  screaming and i think i was trying to meet up with um greg and drew at this point yeah because we
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:21.920]  we're all getting separated as well and the maniac savannah that had just took on like a six foot
[1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:26.800]  seven black dude yeah and we're all getting like fireworks are being thrown all night people are
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:32.080]  starting dumpster fires near the gas station like it's madness out in these streets people are posing
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:38.080]  for selfies while they're screaming profanities at the police like it's just insane and so
[1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:42.480]  we're getting separated throughout this whole entire thing and that is why two is that because
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:48.800]  the only person who's up there able to get this footage because me greg and drew were back behind
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.040]  getting sprayed by rubber bullets yeah what's actually funny this shot right here uh which
[1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:57.600]  i'm taking hdm zooming in through it and i just had an itch i was like something's going on over
[1:45:57.600 --> 1:46:01.520]  there that i don't really know i can't really see it and that's when you could see that i start
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:05.680]  realizing i'm i think i'm going to go walk over there and so i tried to wait wade my way through
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:10.400]  the crowd this is amazing footage by the way for tv viewers and i see it radio listeners can't
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:18.400]  tightening up on basically whatever was going on and that is when around this time there's drew
[1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:22.800]  and you could see he was kind of checking it out there really wasn't much going on
[1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:29.360]  and i kind of stuck around and then i noticed as i was standing here that's some antifa guys
[1:46:29.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  will walk into my shot in just a couple of seconds and this is the point where you supposedly burned
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:40.880]  down the camp yeah we're going to see the loving antifa the little angel cakes yeah because originally
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:44.320]  i was they've got all the media people out here there's another guy just randomly throwing some
[1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:49.840]  stuff on so people were piling on eventually and yeah from there you start to see that a crew
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:54.720]  had three guys on the left will come in there's that there they are so they start to show up
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:47:00.640]  i'm looking at the footage and i'm just trying to film the camp here so you could see the camp
[1:47:00.640 --> 1:47:04.240]  is right next to this fire so here's a couple yeah a lot of these people are just like in the
[1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:08.080]  other footage they're sleeping they're going about the regular night yeah the city's burning
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:14.240]  around them and here's the antifa guy he starts to pull his buddies over this is a young beauty
[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:19.280]  assistant professor yeah who knows who these guys are it's too very and this guy i've recognized
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:24.400]  many times with these old lovers and we can't identify anyone because everyone had masks on
[1:47:24.400 --> 1:47:27.840]  for skinny jeans everything else yeah these guys are in every rally in every video so
[1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:32.080]  they get very recognizable after a while and there's the guy trying to pour water bottles
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:37.040]  into the fire to try to stop it there's more guys there's a veteran and then soon enough in
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:40.960]  about three seconds you see the hands go up on this antifa guy because he's all pumped about
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:50.240]  the mattress here it comes oh so there's antifa hd proof throwing and now he gets mad and now we
[1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:56.000]  have Greg shooting footage from in front and this turns into us burning it down yep and then right
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.480]  here at this point he's so upset he's out of out of his mind upset i haven't been anywhere near the
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.520]  guy as you can clearly see and then i'm the only one who stands around except for the girl ironically
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.760]  in yellow waiting for the moment that she could take her selfie in the background which is so
[1:48:10.880 --> 1:48:17.040]  so telling of society right there and in that shell she's why don't want to reverse her signal
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:24.400]  but i want to go buy that guy a week in a hotel honestly i was planning to do today was go find him
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:28.480]  and interview him yeah we were talking about that earlier well after you burned him on this thing
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:33.440]  that's what i plan on doing today because again let's go let's go to the source who is actually
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:36.640]  there because the people on twitter right now saying that info wars started this fire they
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:40.080]  weren't at they were not there so who is there let's go to the homeless man and let's go to the
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.560]  source and ask him who burned down but we just showed the footage building and we should we show
[1:48:44.560 --> 1:48:49.920]  uh drus footage of this too and we just showed it's not you burning it down yeah it's a skinny
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:54.640]  jeans you know group of gay models nothing against that this right here actually this is more of it
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:58.960]  i want to say this is juice footage right here this might be his livestream actually
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:01.760]  and yeah that just shows that we were hanging out across the street and you could see the
[1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:05.920]  fire is being started right there and we go oh man it's time for us to skip ahead and see what's
[1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.760]  going down yeah that was so it just shows from all points and angles and there i am even injured
[1:49:11.760 --> 1:49:16.240]  shot yeah so we were way away and again this is bigger than it was we're not just doing this to
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:21.280]  defend ourselves this is the top story on twitter at least it was a few hours ago 20 something million
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:27.200]  views of our video and the top thing is alex jones burns up veterans mattress and it's all
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:35.360]  lie it was dirty filthy disgusting antifa trash and then they went after poor zack who's a great
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.280]  guy in poor savannah and it's not about us being victims but we're not going to take it lying down
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:43.200]  but if we didn't have band on video if we didn't have info wars dot com we didn't have these great

[1:52:54.240 --> 1:53:01.040]  because it was only the mirage of safety movies and partying and living like children
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:06.720]  never growing up never caring about other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny
[1:53:07.440 --> 1:53:12.160]  just like the history books show us just like the bible states every time israel became corrupt
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:19.440]  evil and turned away from god never brought into captivity because their people sold out to special
[1:53:19.440 --> 1:53:25.120]  interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again
[1:53:25.120 --> 1:53:32.720]  today compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:37.520]  to fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers
[1:53:37.520 --> 1:53:53.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:04.240]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:10.480]  jones no i get really stressed out every day before i do the show now and this didn't used to
[1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:15.040]  happen 20 years ago i'm like let me find enough cool stuff to cover that's interesting now it's
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:22.000]  just like what the hell there are so many tapes today out of we'll play on next segment a few of
[1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:26.560]  of just a family has an american flag on their business they get torched a guy's got an american
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:31.600]  flag they get beat up women getting beat up and again there's something about men beating up women
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:39.280]  there's all this footage will show next segment of women getting beat up men uh by thugs and
[1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:45.680]  it's so lawless it's so dangerous and it a lot of its racial attacks on whites how and the media
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:50.320]  just promotes it meanwhile cnn got torched and blown up that only got covered one day they shut
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:55.600]  that down really fast savannah they did and a lot of people too were just like you know this is so
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:01.760]  ironic because this was the creation of cnn they have stoked so much division and so much anger
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:06.800]  and fear into society and that was the result of it so it kind of like can you guys roll that b
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:10.960]  roll of cnn we showed where they're taking it over that is so dramatic sorry go ahead no i mean
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:16.960]  it's definite it's not i wouldn't even say karma but it's what they created and it came back to bite
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:22.320]  them in yeah exactly it's not even karma it's like frankenstein makes the the monster it kills it
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:29.440]  yeah and the ultimate irony is when don don lemon is like having huge diatribes on on air about how
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.760]  everyone needs to like go to the streets and then they do and they end up burning down their own
[1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:38.000]  headquarters so he basically invited them to burn it's like all the celebrities who are funding
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.520]  and letting um all these people out of jail right now all these thugs who are looting and riding
[1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:47.360]  and then they're like oh my gosh like the the looters made it to my gated community and they're
[1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:51.440]  burning down my house i can't believe this is happening right now this is ridiculous watch
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.400]  and has that you tweeted it too and so did so did uh cernovich i meant to cover that today there's a
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:00.160]  famous NBA player for this name but he's like literally go burn and they're gonna wait you're
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:04.720]  at my house what the hell yeah he's like no no i'm not here not my house go to your own city and do
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:10.080]  this and it's just so ironic and again like crissy teegan she donated to get these looters and
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:14.480]  riders out of jail so let's take the looters and riders to crissy teegan's house and see how i just
[1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:18.640]  want to tell the riders i don't want to fill out the paperwork please don't come to my house because
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:24.240]  let me tell you're coming to the guns at navarone man i mean you don't want to come there definitely
[1:56:24.240 --> 1:56:27.920]  not gonna go too well yeah i mean i don't want to kill a bunch of people but if you come to hurt
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:33.280]  my family you're dead so and see that's what the left of the globalists want they want to kick
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:37.600]  off this chain reaction yeah and i think and it's funny too you know that's another thing too about
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.360]  why it was so tragic that it was doing with the homeless camp it's like yeah i get it it's across
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:47.440]  the street from the police station you know i do i understand that but it's also one of many other
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:50.640]  places that have police station by the way let me interrupt you they but they finally put it up
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:58.240]  there it is chris martin palmer burn that bleep down burn it all down they just attacked our
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.720]  sister community down the street it's a gated community they tried to climb the gates they had
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:07.920]  to beat them back they destroyed a starbucks and now in front of my building get these animals
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:13.200]  the f out of my neighborhood go back where you live what do you think you're doing chris palmer
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:18.080]  sorry go ahead you know what else do i'm sorry to butt in but i took footage of a store being
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.480]  looted on six street apparently this is a small business incredible footage it's a black owned
[1:57:22.480 --> 1:57:27.360]  business so a lot of people on twitter are really upset and i said this is what you guys are supporting
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:30.880]  this is the reality which tweet is that because that was from yesterday and we'll get him to put it
[1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:35.120]  up what tweet was that what was the name of the tweet we'll pull the video up um if the name of
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:39.280]  the business is private stock i'm not sure what the tweet says but i mean you guys i mean the audio
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:43.680]  all of it is just incredible the looting you got yeah i was right there right when they started
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:48.480]  and it was the best looting i've seen yeah there it is because they just pour in in mass and then
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:55.040]  pour out yeah they looted like two minutes yeah and this is that's the whole point is the hypocrisy
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:00.960]  of it it's like we we're in a situation where you're rioting and you're protesting because of
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:06.000]  this injustice yet it's the most hypocritical point of view you're all only going after homeless
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.320]  people and you're only looting black owned businesses it's like small owned businesses and small owned
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:15.280]  businesses it's madness and more than 50 percent of the people aren't even wearing they're you know
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:20.400]  comorotavirus mandated man exactly anyone not wearing a mask is a demon but now these are heroes
[1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:26.000]  yeah exactly all smiles look at this footage by the way the crews do an incredible job pulling
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:32.480]  this up as fast as we're moving here all right so when we come back we've got a bunch to cover in

[2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:15.440]  about 50 60 clips i mean it's totally insane let's roll the jewelry store in Bellevue that ended
[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:20.800]  up being broken into and looted and then we'll go to the looting of cbs calling for getting the
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:31.840]  vicarins carts set up with rocks uh white suburbs uh looting belvedere square we've also got looters
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:40.320]  completely ransacked square mall it just goes on and there's hundreds of these videos here it is
[2:00:43.680 --> 2:00:47.200]  what's up with mattresses like they're attacking to get the mattresses they just burn the homeless
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:01:03.280]  guys mattresses so this is how you battle the establishment by the way all these idiots pulling
[2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:06.640]  up their cars doing this they're gonna get indicted because it's all getting picked up on
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:22.880]  a security camera you're gonna have a lit ass night tonight
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:40.320]  the white folks go out the anti-funds say protest get whitey and then this is what it
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:44.320]  right down to civilization and the globalists are hoping somebody starts shooting these people
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:49.200]  and that's the most frustrating part too alex is as soon as one of these people gets shot
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:53.440]  it's going to be turned into to making them the victim it really is
[2:01:57.200 --> 2:02:03.200]  yes none of this has to do with the man that was shot and killed or the man that was run over or
[2:02:03.200 --> 2:02:12.160]  the man that had a cop on his neck do you want to get that and you've got the leftist again
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:17.120]  like the so-called white intellectuals always leading it these are literally university professors
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:21.840]  running all this yeah here's footage of a cigar shop people looting it and then the guy shows up
[2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:25.440]  with his guns love my shade to go through the window and they just open the door
[2:02:28.880 --> 2:02:37.520]  i don't even know what to make of 2020 anymore complete chaos you know they tried to loot target
[2:02:37.520 --> 2:02:42.640]  here in austin yesterday but the police shut it down real quick really quick they didn't do that
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:48.720]  much damage really yep
[2:02:54.160 --> 2:02:59.520]  there's so much other footage here but but just both of you guys where do you see all this going
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:09.200]  i mean honestly i see it getting worse if this continues like this i mean the next narrative
[2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:13.840]  probably will be that we're now going to be in phase two of coronavirus lockdown because everyone's
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:18.720]  going to say that these which is so ironic because we've been going to rallies all this time and i
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:24.480]  still have yet to see a report of a coronavirus patient that came out of our uh you know open
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:28.720]  texas rallies that i've oh exactly man in this entire time but yeah exactly but it's a permanent
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.160]  state of martial law exactly out of corona into race war back into corona yeah so i think the economy
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:38.720]  shut down and everybody goes bankrupt it's a loop and then yeah on top of it it's like yeah
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:44.960]  we opened up stores it was like black friday all over austin and they they needed the new narrative
[2:03:44.960 --> 2:03:49.600]  to kind of keep things in check so i feel like that's word we're just leading to the next situation
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:53.440]  where and again it makes everybody further racially devives exactly what the globalist want
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:03:58.640]  exactly alex and that's what this has all been about is racial division because if you look up
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:06.000]  to what led up to this we saw almed arbery bryanna taylor jimmy fowling got cancelled for his um
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:11.120]  snl clip from the early 2000s for blackface then we saw the central park video then it was george
[2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:16.080]  floyd so it was just more and more and more racial division and you know alex you asked where we're
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:20.800]  going to be going next or what happens now what happens now is a lot of people are going to learn
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:24.800]  the hard way that when you attack someone in their vehicle you get run over a lot of people are going
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:30.000]  to learn the hard way that when you attack someone's home or business owner who's a gun owner
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:33.440]  you're going to get shot and you're going to get killed and you're not going to be the victim
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:38.880]  and america is not going to defend you because this is not defendable behavior at all so a lot
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:43.680]  of people are going to learn the hard way because they're so dumb that they're going to die because
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:48.320]  of their dumb actions yeah that's where we're going next yeah and people need to pay close
[2:04:48.320 --> 2:04:52.160]  attention they really do like they need to pay it really really close attention this footage is
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:04:57.280]  always going to be cut up there's so many versions of hd's if different well look how they blamed you
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:01.280]  you guys saying you had burned up a homeless yeah we haven't even shown some anus full footage
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:05.440]  where they they were the ones burning even more up yeah i mean even with george floyd
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:12.640]  there was one of the protesters they were trying to portray him as getting hit by a cop car and if
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:17.280]  you watch the footage they smashed the cop car they're riding on top of the cop car the cop is
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:22.160]  freaked out he drives away and the guy falls off the cop car and you know this is a perfect example
[2:05:22.160 --> 2:05:25.920]  too of what's going on right now with the whole us burning the mattress thing this is a perfect
[2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:31.520]  example of social media and how quickly and how easily people are manipulated and people just
[2:05:31.520 --> 2:05:36.400]  want to jump on to the next thing that is going to further cause division and war in america
[2:05:36.400 --> 2:05:42.000]  absolutely people do not want us to be together people don't these people are not doing this because
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.920]  they want to come together for george floyd they're jumping on any story they can to further divide
[2:05:45.920 --> 2:05:50.160]  america because this is what they want and this is political at this point too and they've been
[2:05:50.160 --> 2:05:54.800]  taught they all go to community college that a communist revolution is going to empower them
[2:05:54.800 --> 2:06:01.920]  well move to north korea now let's hit this exclusive on info wars dot com that we broke
[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:07.600]  towards the end of the first hour video george floyd tried to hide white powder during arrest
[2:06:07.600 --> 2:06:13.920]  let's go ahead and roll that video for tv viewers he also fought inside the police car we're not
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:18.640]  singing deserve to die but here's how he worked with both these police officers at the nightclub
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:23.360]  now it's both of them it was all very very very incestuous i don't mean they were having sexual
[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:29.200]  kids and they were all very close to each other uh and boom there is the white powder uh he's
[2:06:29.200 --> 2:06:34.000]  reportedly they said he died of a heart attack not of affixiation i'm not defending what the cop
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:39.200]  did the guy says he can't breathe but a lot of experts say he had a heart attack because he was
[2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:42.560]  panicking and i get it being put in handcuffs or cops sitting your head will do that i'm not
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:47.840]  defending it but this again we're learning the rest of the story they waited a long time to release
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:53.680]  uh this camera footage this is on cbs abc all but none of them are pointing out what's on the raw
[2:06:53.680 --> 2:07:04.240]  video that he's pulled it out of his back pocket boom on the ground and the cops don't even pick up
[2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:08.080]  on that they take him over he fights in the car we've got footage of that i guess we can play
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:13.920]  in a moment get that ready uh zack what do you make of this yeah i mean it i mean no matter what
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:19.280]  they're fighting getting man right here yeah that's i mean i mean i did not want to be arrested
[2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:26.160]  yeah for sure i think that's clear and it's it's i mean this footage is it's i don't really know
[2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:30.160]  if this changes any of them any more of the narrative just because of the fact that i mean
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:37.520]  the cop obviously knew the guy he obviously knew that this guy the the cop felt better than him
[2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:43.440]  for sure and obviously this guy might have been going through some things and was probably trying
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:50.400]  to avoid it but at the end of the day you know they're gonna want it's because of the the knee on
[2:07:50.400 --> 2:07:55.040]  the neck more than anything else i think but the cops indicted so this whole thing that will
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:07:59.600]  yeah go beat up a white lady outside her business because she's white that that too wrong don't make
[2:07:59.600 --> 2:08:04.160]  her right that none of that makes any sense does it make white people newsflash want to be nice to
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:08.400]  black people on average it makes white people become racist yeah it just it makes me feel like
[2:08:08.400 --> 2:08:14.400]  you know if you what are you going after what like what what agenda is there by burning it all down
[2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:19.120]  at the end of the day it's like i'm people with j o and again why they call the cops on
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:22.640]  yeah because he was bombed out of his brain past the fake 20s i'm sorry the guy's dead
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:29.120]  but i know don't resist the police if i don't want to get hurt really bad i mean yeah well
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:34.320]  that's what this comes down to to alex is people want to break the law and then when the police come
[2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:39.280]  and try to arrest them they resist and then they get hurt at the end of the day if you do not
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:44.320]  resist arrest you're not gonna get killed and that's a fact well exactly and at the left takes over
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:48.080]  and organizes the police to come take our guns i'll organize people will fight they're now the
[2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:53.120]  enemy let's get organized let's boom you know but i'm not it's it's not the cop who i hate though
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:08:57.760]  it's the corruption giving them the illegal order yeah but this was the illegal order somebody called
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:03.120]  on him he was reportedly drunk out of control passing fake 20s they fought to get him in
[2:09:03.120 --> 2:09:08.800]  and they put him down they put their knee on him a combination of drugs and that killed him
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:12.560]  and now we've got riots all over the country yeah and the generalization of the fact that this
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:18.000]  man had prior history of being violent the cop he had prior history of having aggressive behavior
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.520]  with all sorts of different um assailants it wasn't just about one black man and he worked
[2:09:23.520 --> 2:09:27.680]  with that guy so they had a past relationship that they don't even address and we don't humanize
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:32.800]  all the other people exactly so they make it one blanket every cop is bad but this guy was clearly
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:39.040]  the one truly terrible and he's been indicted yes all right guys well thanks for clearing up that we
[2:09:39.040 --> 2:09:42.720]  didn't order you to go down there and burn down the homeless camp it was anti-fuckers they're
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:47.840]  terrorists thank you so much great job now it's official the united nations came out yesterday
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:54.160]  and said the covid emergency will last five years and the uk government said you must all
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:59.440]  carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing
[2:09:59.440 --> 2:10:04.480]  and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:10.960]  list of 10 you'll be permanently detained yes ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:15.520]  where they let the criminals out of jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers
[2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:21.680]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner from the beginning of my research it was clear
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:27.120]  the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group they have to put this electronic straight
[2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:34.160]  jacket on us before they carry out their endgame which is global depopulation so you see submitting
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:40.960]  to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they

[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:25.040]  about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and
[2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:29.040]  then every day when i kept hearing you and dr grove and those commercials i said you know what i'm

[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:54.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:12:14.800]  all right two great american patriots are with me now michael cargill and elin shroyer
[2:12:15.760 --> 2:12:20.720]  and both of these guys are living right here in austin texas one of the main epicenters of the
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:28.240]  protesting and rioting and bizarreness going on and i just tell it like i see it um the instigators
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:37.120]  are about 90 white middle aged men and women university types trying to foment stuff and
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:41.520]  then to the actual looting and stuff it's about 50 50 different racial groups doing it and there
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:46.080]  are white people being racially attacked there's so many videos i i'm not trying to inflame people
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:51.200]  but if you want to talk about racial attacks i don't like seeing this this guy die of george
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:56.640]  floyd it looks bad but i don't like seeing why people get beat up either racially it's very upsetting
[2:12:56.640 --> 2:13:00.560]  but that's what the media knows they're doing they're trying to create this flashpoint but separate
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:05.920]  from that i've got a call from four different people in the last day now with cargill i didn't
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:09.520]  get a call like i got sent a message by another friend saying hey you know cargill's they tried
[2:13:09.520 --> 2:13:14.000]  to rob his place i've had three other people i know that have had their garages their houses
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:18.800]  robbed in one person mugged downtown and it was because of what color they were so this is very
[2:13:18.800 --> 2:13:23.360]  very dangerous this is all sorrows fun and we've covered it but michael cargill owns central texas
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:29.680]  gunworks he's 12 years u.s army uh patriot uh studied criminal justice at troy state university
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.000]  he he he trained me when michael still carries a good friend of mine everybody knows him that's a
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:39.760]  routine listener but then i learned from his facebook this morning that he they had tried to rob him
[2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:45.200]  now another gun shop did get robbed no one knows this yet we're not going to say the name but just
[2:13:45.200 --> 2:13:49.680]  know that's how bad it is that when the police are having to guard their own facilities and the
[2:13:49.680 --> 2:13:55.120]  national guard surrounding the capital crime is super high and the media well the government's
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:59.200]  not going to tell you because they don't want the criminals to know they're winning but this is a very
[2:13:59.200 --> 2:14:05.760]  dangerous destabilization of the country right now ahead of the election so michael cargill and
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:10.000]  owens shroyer with us a little bit of the next hour then jerry solente takes over then owens back but
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:15.440]  a good to see you mr cargill yes sir absolutely good to see you mr shroyer corona shake uh
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:20.960]  where do you want to start with what happened to your facility down the road or with the big picture
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:25.920]  yeah alex this this is just crazy we're really in some crazy times you know these guys uh they
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:32.160]  actually six of them spent you know a few minutes just trying to break into this to the store they
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:37.600]  shot up the store they actually fired rounds uh inside the the metal door they broke the glass
[2:14:37.600 --> 2:14:43.680]  they fired three shots one hit the ground one hit the ceiling uh they tried to shoot up the the lock
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:50.000]  and everything and just so the headline should be texas gun store shot up by thugs yes absolutely
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.640]  absolutely show that footage in slow motion and we can't keep going and so uh they they made an
[2:14:54.640 --> 2:14:58.080]  attempt they tried to ram the door they tried everything possible to get inside the shop and
[2:14:58.080 --> 2:15:03.680]  we missed them by 30 seconds another 30 seconds and we would have them so luckily you know i i think
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:08.400]  god was looking out for him because i should have just come in live saying our good buddy cargill's
[2:15:08.400 --> 2:15:14.080]  office just got shot up and ran by thugs right and so you almost showed up yeah we almost got there
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:18.960]  got there in 30 seconds and we almost had him and and it was not just us you know quite a few gun
[2:15:18.960 --> 2:15:24.480]  stores uh in in austin area were actually hit last night we were lucky we were able to stop them they
[2:15:24.480 --> 2:15:28.320]  didn't get anything they didn't get inside the the store at all our our countermeasures actually
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:33.120]  worked so i'm grateful for that but then some other gun stores weren't as lucky as we were uh some
[2:15:33.120 --> 2:15:40.000]  guns you know some places lost quite a few dozens of guns quite a few dozens and they shot into your
[2:15:40.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  building oh yeah they shot into the building so i'm glad i my employees were not inside at the time
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.160]  you know because you know they could have one of my employees could have gotten shot this is getting
[2:15:50.160 --> 2:15:55.440]  insane i mean have you gotten calls from friends and family about the crime increasing yes and
[2:15:55.440 --> 2:15:59.520]  things that it's it's increasing all over the country and just like you said alex uh what it is
[2:15:59.520 --> 2:16:04.880]  is you have national guard you're pleased they're they're concentrating on you know their buildings
[2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:08.400]  you know state buildings and stuff like that their infrastructure they're not worried about you know
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.480]  private businesses so we have to and it goes back to the law it's up to us yes explain that to people
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:16.480]  because it is up to us to make sure that we take care of ourselves you're gonna have to take care
[2:16:16.480 --> 2:16:21.440]  of yourself you have to take care of your family it's going to be up to you and so you know you
[2:16:21.440 --> 2:16:26.960]  got to arm yourself you know this is we're this is this is for real here it this is this is it
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:32.080]  this is what we train for this is what we've been talking about you know from day one for 20 years
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:37.040]  ago this is what we're getting ready for because it is upon us right now police are not going to
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:40.480]  come and save you you're gonna have to come and save yourself by the way i've never slept with
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:48.480]  the rifle out i do it now because it's on absolutely but we'll keep going and so um this is this is
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:53.120]  it's madness you know with the the protests around the country i just don't understand alex i don't
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:59.840]  understand you know why they indicted the cop yes within day so he did something wrong i mean
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:06.160]  he's indicted so let's let you know let's let everything you know work out were you expecting
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:12.080]  though to have your shop robbed we were prepared we were we were actually watching the place that
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:18.080]  night um they caught us just as someone taking a break and they just got lucky lucky for them
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:22.160]  it was lucky for them because another 30 seconds would have someone taken a break
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:27.520]  and they came back they we saw them before the alarm went off and then we started rolling in
[2:17:27.520 --> 2:17:31.600]  that direction and if it wasn't for that we would have caught them another few more you know just
[2:17:31.600 --> 2:17:36.800]  a few seconds well don't these dumbasses know how dangerous is to hit a gun shop very because we
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:41.200]  have countermeasures we're prepared we're prepared to respond i'm i'm prepared to respond because i
[2:17:41.200 --> 2:17:44.800]  don't know how long it's going to take long for something to get there so it's not a matter of if
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:50.240]  it's a matter of when it's going to happen and notice you are in a much better position today
[2:17:50.240 --> 2:17:55.200]  than some of the other gun stores out there because you took those precautions that's right
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:17:58.800]  and you have to you have to lock your stuff up you have to you know put it behind i know you
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:02.720]  can't get into it and give it away but a major gun store got robbed last night that's right so what
[2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:07.680]  they got they got away with you said 40 guns about 40 guns well what were you told and so
[2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:12.320]  about 40 guns are out there on the streets and uh not only just one gun store you know multiple
[2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:17.120]  gun stores were actually hit federal farms lices dealers so the atf is on it you know they're
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:21.520]  they're looking for these guys they're and it was the same i saw guys case in my house two days ago
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:27.760]  yeah no the left has uh they've they've activated their local terror cells in all and all they're
[2:18:27.760 --> 2:18:32.240]  launching everything hundred percent all all activities that they've been coordinating and
[2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:36.880]  you know the scary thing about this alex you know i was sitting here with you what was this 48 hours
[2:18:36.880 --> 2:18:42.480]  ago and and it was me and and tim and we said hey you know the cops don't make hundreds of arrests
[2:18:42.480 --> 2:18:46.720]  within the next six hours there's going to be looting and and riding in this town sadly that
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:52.240]  was easy to predict and it ended up happening and so for us to be the mayor is endorsing this
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:56.080]  yes people people are getting they're starting to realize how personal this is getting though
[2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:00.160]  with people showing up at their houses showing up at their businesses this isn't just showing up at
[2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:03.920]  some other going to stand their fair banks house and going everybody's and so i want people to
[2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:12.400]  understand um this is why john brendan needed to have his security clearance removed two years ago
[2:19:12.400 --> 2:19:19.200]  he has continued to use well he's behind this databases that he gets access to that he can
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:25.440]  give access to to locate and track your address your phone number they've got us all on maps
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:30.400]  they really do now and they hand feed that down to these people now it's a lot easier to go into a
[2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:35.200]  you know boutique or some store that doesn't have armed security or there's nobody there
[2:19:35.200 --> 2:19:40.240]  that could even defend it it's a lot easier to do that and say show up at somebody's house where
[2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:44.400]  they know they're going to be met with a firearm uh so i don't know if it'll ever get to that point
[2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:48.160]  but that's the next level but here's alex you were talking about this too what are they going to do
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:52.000]  next you know it's so easy these people are so easy to predict now alex we i don't know how we
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:57.040]  didn't see this coming they're gonna attack how do you how if you're the mainstream news how do you
[2:19:57.040 --> 2:20:01.920]  come out of a fake pandemic how do you come out of a pandemic that you just faked well that's easy
[2:20:01.920 --> 2:20:09.280]  race riots race war and so why do they come out of this with mass shooting 100 bonafide guaranteed
[2:20:09.280 --> 2:20:14.640]  oh you're right a mass shooting a white supremacist now the good news is oh yeah the good news is
[2:20:14.640 --> 2:20:18.000]  because the schools and everything are out of session and sports leagues they don't really
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:21.360]  have anywhere to get away with it so that's going to be interesting is what venue are they
[2:20:21.360 --> 2:20:25.920]  going to choose to have a mass shooting and then blame whoever they want because this stuff will
[2:20:25.920 --> 2:20:30.160]  boil over probably within a month i would guess it's it's going to boil over or it's going to
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:34.000]  be coming all out civil war i don't think we're there yet so they're going to i've never had this
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:38.640]  many calls about people getting robbed i mean it's it's bad i mean you can i'm sure michael can
[2:20:38.640 --> 2:20:42.320]  tell us in the next segment i mean you can't even buy a guns or ammo anymore it's getting tough it's
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:47.840]  hard you had your mega family with us we're about feudalism in the ancient world from asia to europe
[2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:53.360]  from africa to latin america was the most common form of government you had a ruling class the
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:58.000]  nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:05.280]  subsistence starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:11.040]  people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:17.440]  kept them again at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive they would never try to
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:22.320]  challenge the entrenched elite well now all the big google owners and the rockefellers and the roth
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:27.040]  childs the jeff bezos is the world they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:34.560]  helicopters and private jets living the life laughing at you shut down going bankrupt into
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:40.800]  third world starving to death their religion is power and control and they are pressing that
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:46.240]  advantage against us we must break free from these monsters i was talking to my wife tonight and i was
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:52.640]  saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:57.920]  before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said well yeah when i grew up in Omaha
[2:21:57.920 --> 2:22:02.720]  Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head
[2:22:03.280 --> 2:22:08.160]  and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:14.000]  walked around gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  that's what's gonna happen with our economy it is in cardiac arrest this has been done by design
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:25.120]  and the un the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated it hyped it and tried to keep the
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:31.040]  economy closed so remember the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on
[2:22:31.040 --> 2:22:38.320]  the un on billa melinda gates on obama on hillary on biden on the democrats we tried to stop it we
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:42.720]  tried to fight it but you guys have said you wanted to wreck america and the world and now
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:50.240]  you've done it congratulations we're living in insanely dangerous times and i've told folks
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:53.920]  the one back three months ago i'm not buying storeable food because i'm worried about the
[2:22:53.920 --> 2:22:58.240]  covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now
[2:22:58.240 --> 2:23:02.480]  it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:06.800]  collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and it's even worse in the third world so
[2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:11.520]  i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud and the
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:17.120]  covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on now is the time
[2:23:17.120 --> 2:23:22.640]  to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're in easily totable bags it's high
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:26.960]  quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds the info war so we
[2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:31.920]  have storeable food available again infowarstore.com or call toll free triple eight two five three
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:35.840]  three one three nine whatever you do get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you
[2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:41.440]  dependent on them they do not want you to be self-sufficient get your storeable food at infowarstore.com
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:50.160]  right now while you still can you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:50.160 --> 2:24:03.760]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show
[2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:10.960]  by the way folks people have noticed over the last 24 years i've been on air that i don't just get
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:17.280]  up here and say alarmist stuff for no reason this is communist china and corrupt multinational
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:21.600]  corporations that believe they can overthrow the u.s government our government's got problems i've
[2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:26.320]  been anti-corrupt police i'm the guy that's against violating posse common taught us in our rights
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:31.200]  i'm not against cops being anti-police state means you're against unconstitutional things
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:36.160]  that are dangerous and so of course now that we've got trump and we're trying to turn the
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:40.560]  country back on we're trying to kick out the foreign powers of course i'm for law enforcement
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:44.800]  as long as they're in their constitutional role because they are duly sworn to protect and defend
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:48.480]  us but at the end of the day it's our job to protect ourselves they're just there to respond
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.400]  after the crime's committed if they have a chance to stop the crime they're duly supposed to do
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:57.680]  something just like we are under common law and so michael cargill really lays this out well
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:02.000]  in the interviews he does with us but uh i said where do you want to go next with this and he had
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:06.240]  a point we'll get to in a second but oh and i want listeners understand we're not in the normal season
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:11.920]  here and and america's got its problems all day long but man the chai comms are the most evil
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:16.320]  people on the planet what they've done to their own people what they've done to the Uighurs all
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:21.520]  they think people need to just they need to get the facts that this is a globalist takeover and
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:25.920]  trump is arresting the chinese spies trump is going after him this this country's fighting for its
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:32.960]  life right now yeah alex i think the problem is the corruption that we're dealing with is so complex
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:39.280]  and this world is so complex and it's so well disguised and it can morph in an instant and we're
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:45.040]  so enslaved to the television media they can yeah like we're smart and we can barely get yeah it's
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:50.160]  like and they can do a three-card money on us at any given time and so the biggest problem i think
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:54.480]  that americans are having is we can't even be honest with ourselves and if you can't even be
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:58.240]  honest with yourself about what's going on in this country right now then how are you going to face
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:04.720]  the larger issue of china stealing the prosperity of united states inner cities and politicians
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:09.440]  and business owners selling out that potential prosperity for america design other countries
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:15.360]  to make us control so if they can't if they how are they going to possibly grasp that reality if
[2:26:15.360 --> 2:26:20.160]  they can't sit here and look at this and say okay yeah antifa has been a terror cell in the united
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:24.560]  states for four years yeah you know what there's a lot of black races out here beating white people
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:29.840]  hey there's police officers that are clearly out here not doing a very good job and you know what
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:33.680]  this is some some bad incidents we've had with police maybe there's a way we can fix this guess
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.240]  what these are all issues and maybe we could deal with all of them but we're not even honest about
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:43.200]  any of them we can't even we can't even sit here and face them alex why why are police constantly
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.080]  in our businesses why why do the police always pull people over why do black people feel like
[2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:52.640]  they're targeted by the police what is really at the stake of that is it the war on drugs is
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:57.600]  it that there's more crime in inner cities where there's impoverished people we all know this but
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:01.760]  it's the meat it's the left trying to go out and stir this up i agree so let me ask again what's
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:07.360]  coming next i agree a mass shooting yeah i think they're wound up and i and i think attacks on
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:11.840]  infrastructure cargill what do you think's coming next it's it's election time so you know all all
[2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:15.680]  the cards are on the table they're trying anything they possibly all bets are off that's right so you
[2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:20.400]  have uh you know without coronavirus at us and we're now we're all in a flux right now so it's
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:26.560]  like now you know what's gonna happen what we should do is hey let's uh you know let's cause some
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:31.680]  type of a disruption or something like that you got now you have law enforcement or military on our
[2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:36.960]  streets right now that are overstepping their bounds our soldiers they spent time in iraq and
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:42.000]  Afghanistan done things that you you know that no one wants to know about and now here we are
[2:27:42.000 --> 2:27:46.240]  we have the same soldiers right here on our streets right now doing the exact same thing
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:50.720]  there's a video of them man rolling down let's roll with audio roll it right now at the beginning
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:28:03.920]  there rolling let's watch that from the start here it is
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:10.560]  look at this they just keep coming
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:36.080]  so again the left knowingly has conjured this to hope things get out of bounds to trigger a real
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:41.280]  revolt what you're saying what in what country are we in we're you know this is the united states of
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:46.960]  america we have a constitution here you you don't have the authority to tell a family or anyone to
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:50.800]  get inside their house they're on their property you don't have that authority but covid created
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:54.240]  that idea yes and now we're talking about you know what they're they're gonna come out next and
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:58.880]  they're gonna say hey we need the police need more they need more equipment they need more
[2:28:58.880 --> 2:29:04.080]  more um you know more tactical equipment you know they need bigger equipment tanks and stuff like
[2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:06.880]  that that's what's going to come next and then they're going to come with some type so the left
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:11.040]  knows what they've done oh yeah they know exactly what well that's the argument you say oh designate
[2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:15.360]  antifa is a terrorist but what the left gets controlled they'll designate gun owners a terrorist
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:20.880]  my issue is use the the racketeering laws against them and by the way antifa will just morph into
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:26.480]  the next alphabet soup uh you know front soros group you know whether there's come they'll
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:30.080]  they'll just morph into the next you know no i agree so how do we thread the needle cargill
[2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:34.640]  man i don't know we we're just gonna have to we need to train ourselves and get ready for this
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:38.960]  you need to make sure you that's the bottom line is that if the citizens are armed the criminals
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:42.400]  won't be able to break down society and bring in martial law that is absolutely correct you know
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:46.080]  you got to get all the things that you need to protect yourself and also your family get your
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:50.320]  firearms get some ammunition and make sure that you're training your proficient and all listen
[2:29:50.320 --> 2:29:55.040]  i'm a pretty confident guy and you and you train me from i could still carry years ago but i'm not
[2:29:55.040 --> 2:29:58.480]  the type of guy that you normally carries a gun i'm carrying one now because you can just tell
[2:29:58.480 --> 2:30:03.440]  let's go time it is and you should be you you you have to in the time that we are right now
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:07.600]  where you have people that are you know just showing up at your home you know unannounced
[2:30:07.600 --> 2:30:11.440]  i mean that is just crazy you know i shouldn't have to sit there and watch my cameras i shouldn't
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:16.240]  have to do this but that's where we are today uh that's that's just what's happening right now i
[2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:20.080]  carry this right here that i got from central texas gunworks all the time that's right that's
[2:30:20.080 --> 2:30:23.680]  right and and now's the time to talk to your neighbors isn't it yes you need to know your
[2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:28.480]  neighbors uh i actually i've trained all my neighbors uh that's good years ago gotta talk about that you
[2:30:28.480 --> 2:30:33.280]  talked about that on there yeah years ago we i brought them into my house we sat down we talked
[2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:37.200]  about you know security plans talked about what happens inside the home if someone was to break
[2:30:37.200 --> 2:30:41.760]  into your house talked about your alarm system monitoring things upstairs on the second floor
[2:30:41.760 --> 2:30:45.280]  and all that stuff and that's normal people think that is weird it is not no no we spent
[2:30:45.280 --> 2:30:50.880]  time about insurance about the yard about the car about grandma how about security yeah absolutely
[2:30:50.880 --> 2:30:55.840]  make sure you use your alarm system make sure you have cameras use those cameras how how what
[2:30:55.840 --> 2:30:59.200]  what are you gonna do if something happens in the middle of the night you know you need to see
[2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:02.880]  what's going on you don't want to run outside your door to investigate what you need to do is
[2:31:02.880 --> 2:31:06.640]  have a little safe room a little area where everyone's to meet you want to accidentally shoot one of
[2:31:06.640 --> 2:31:10.720]  your loved ones right right in my closet my bedroom i've got cameras right there around the house
[2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:14.480]  i got instant access pistol safe i can just look at what's going on right because you don't you
[2:31:14.480 --> 2:31:18.080]  you don't know how many people are involved in all this stuff it happened with my parents with three
[2:31:18.080 --> 2:31:22.480]  and four people that tell that story three or four people actually tried to do a home invasion
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:28.480]  of my my parents house uh my parents had to secure themselves in the bedroom uh they actually got a
[2:31:28.480 --> 2:31:32.080]  ladder climbed onto the second floor of my parents house while they were sleeping at four o'clock in
[2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:36.240]  the morning and they crawled through the master bathroom window because that was the only window
[2:31:36.240 --> 2:31:42.240]  that was open at four o'clock in the morning and so my dad actually woke up heard the noise saw the
[2:31:42.240 --> 2:31:46.400]  light went into the bathroom shot this guy right in the face stopped him he fell right outside the
[2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:51.760]  door and died right outside the on the ledge there and people just don't get how dangerous to this till
[2:31:51.760 --> 2:31:55.680]  it happens to them very dangerous and my parents never thought in a million years that someone
[2:31:55.680 --> 2:32:00.160]  would would actually try to climb on the second floor of their home the house they lived in and
[2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:05.120]  for over 20 years but your dad was like the guard dog he was yes and you don't you don't expect that
[2:32:05.120 --> 2:32:09.360]  you don't think that you wake up in the middle of the night uh you when you fire a gun that flash
[2:32:09.360 --> 2:32:13.920]  is going to blind you this is going to take a couple seconds to get your bearings um the ringing

[2:36:46.480 --> 2:36:53.360]  distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an l could say 600 yards even if you hit
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:37:00.160]  them right in the heart they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe a hundred yards they've got that adrenaline
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:04.880]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down
[2:37:04.880 --> 2:37:11.760]  they realize what's happened they fall over and they die then you go back and haul them back in
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:17.600]  well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:24.240]  show is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:28.880]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably over
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:33.440]  a hundred million dead according to the UN and i believe their numbers because it's the very UN
[2:37:33.440 --> 2:37:37.840]  that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that thought it
[2:37:37.840 --> 2:37:41.760]  was their revolution to get rid of trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something

[2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:37.200]  that keep scrolling down for what's going on the brainwashing of the left believing anything

[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:20.880]  busy dealing with all the rioters uh so they're not able to move away from that area so they know
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:25.040]  that hey they're busy so that's their time to go in this is the guy shooting your front door how
[2:39:25.040 --> 2:39:28.960]  many times yeah so he fired three shots at the front door tried to break you try to shoot the
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:33.440]  lock he tried to shoot the uh the bottom of the door you know we had rounds go through hit the
[2:39:33.440 --> 2:39:38.080]  floor rounds hit the ceiling uh yeah these guys and they had bags they were thinking they were
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:42.640]  you know getting ready to go in and just grab a bunch of guns and run out but no we have the
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:46.480]  place is secured you know we have good countermeasures and and everything worked everything worked
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:52.160]  like but other gun shops got hit last night so what happens once the criminals get the guns
[2:39:52.160 --> 2:39:57.440]  now you have guns on the street you have uh at least about three dozen guns are on our
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:01.760]  austin streets right now in texas and we don't know what's going to happen with those guns
[2:40:01.760 --> 2:40:06.960]  in the hands of criminals no laws will stop that without getting into the the shop others were
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:11.600]  mentally robbed the one you know about how did they get in how did they get them the police
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:15.520]  didn't respond do you know anything else i just you know with like i said with law enforcement
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:20.000]  being busy you know they can't cover everywhere they can't respond as quickly as possible and in
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:24.640]  that area you had a lot of different places that were hit last night and so police just couldn't
[2:40:24.640 --> 2:40:30.240]  get there in enough time and so now we have uh three dozen guns or more out in the streets
[2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:36.080]  and now you have protests we have stolen guns this is going to be a good night tonight in austin
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:41.520]  texas how long michael do you think this is going to keep going crazy this is going to keep going
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:48.800]  until uh we have our our mayor our our your local city governments got to you know let the police
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:52.480]  do what there's you know they need to do when it comes to these riders and by the way that same
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:40:57.520]  mayor tried to close you a month ago yes tried to shut us down because he tried to have a code
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:02.400]  enforcement law law enforcement and also the fire marshal come down and shut us down and tell us
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:05.840]  that we were not in the central and you told them no and then the governor came out and signed an
[2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:10.800]  order saying you were right that's right cargill's cargill you're always at the center of everything
[2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:14.480]  i am too but how are we doing what's going on so is that one what's going on with us here
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:18.320]  like the three musketeers or something or just no but how are we always at the center of everything
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:22.880]  just men that take action it's really not even that dynamic it's just men that want to take action
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:27.280]  men that care about the future of this country oh except we're being overrun all we're doing staying
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:31.040]  no that's right yeah we're alpha dogs and we're leaders of the pack and we're not you know we're
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:34.960]  not followers and we're making sure that hey we're gonna stand up and say this is enough enough is
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:39.520]  enough and this is what we're gonna do to stop it you know alex and speaking of law enforcement
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:46.320]  i want to point out the fact that uh and by the way the new york police are pissed today because
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:50.320]  they found out and they were wondering why and and i and i said this the other day and i kind of
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:53.760]  stand by this to be honest because i don't know what other option the police have at this point
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:58.960]  police did not sign up to be a punching bag for rioters and that's what they're being asked to
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:03.760]  do right now they're not being asked to kneel and so i'm dead serious like i wouldn't want black
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:08.640]  people or anybody brown kneeling before me because of the color they are since when is this i mean
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:12.400]  this is insane i mean i don't think cops should turn their badge in because they're bad people i
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:17.520]  think cops would turn their bad because they are not punching bags they're they're being told to
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:22.480]  sit out here and take these rioters take the bricks at their head take the projectiles take the
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:27.280]  fireworks and have soft action and now they find out this is going to tick them all off alex i'm
[2:42:27.280 --> 2:42:34.320]  telling you keith ellison's son a member of antifa ilhan omar's daughter supporting antifa former
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:40.240]  governor of minnesota yeah the mayor of new york's daughter arrested all so all the democrat local
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:49.280]  politicians kids are in with the rioters and now you know why they're telling police to go lightly
[2:42:49.280 --> 2:42:56.080]  because their children are rioting with the mob and so believe me police are going to be pissed off
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:43:00.880]  about this and again hey i'm against police brutality i want to end the war on drugs you don't
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:06.160]  even provide we all know that oh and this is a communist takeover but let's go on to the next
[2:43:06.160 --> 2:43:10.080]  level of this alex because i think this will there'll be a mass shooting or something these are the
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:13.520]  craziest times ever there'll be a mass shooting oh no everything's accelerating they just faked
[2:43:13.520 --> 2:43:16.800]  a pandemic we'll get back to that in a minute but so there'll be a mass shooting or something
[2:43:16.800 --> 2:43:21.040]  we'll detract from the riots and then it'll all calm down but then in about two or three months
[2:43:22.080 --> 2:43:26.400]  the officer i forget his name chauvin or whatever he's probably going to get acquitted
[2:43:26.400 --> 2:43:32.000]  for this murder yes because it's going to come out that floyd uh was severely intoxicated
[2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:37.120]  and died of a heart attack not asphyxiation and the i guarantee you the cops are sitting on police
[2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:41.120]  footage right now that they can't release of the resisting of the arrest and the original
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:46.880]  arrest it's in the car yeah you see the fight going on so imagine when that sparks off imagine
[2:43:46.880 --> 2:43:53.040]  when round two of this sparks off in july or august then it's i mean then it's really going to be you
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:58.480]  better be this subject of covid being a hoax it changes the subject i agree so how do we bypass
[2:43:58.480 --> 2:44:02.960]  this cargo i don't know but it's crazy how you you have new york city which was ground zero for
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:08.560]  covet 19 and now you have people you know in thousands when you looked at you know new york
[2:44:08.560 --> 2:44:13.760]  city last night you would thought it was new year's eve there's so many people that's right
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.640]  nobody's allowed to go out until this and now all your heroes hey right it's remember you had me on
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:22.800]  air it was like three weeks ago how i'm getting banned everywhere attacked for organizing anti
[2:44:22.800 --> 2:44:28.720]  lockdown riots now they're all promoting damn riots right right what about social distancing all that
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:32.240]  stuff they were talking about you know one to shut us down because the social well let's just say
[2:44:32.240 --> 2:44:36.640]  this the economy shutting down has already created death and third world depression here
[2:44:37.280 --> 2:44:40.560]  and they want to just change the subject when the depression totally comes home
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:46.640]  into a race war but but that's but see alex that's a formulaic thing that they've done because think
[2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:51.120]  about it how many people have been out of work for the last three months how many of these
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:55.840]  riders haven't got a paycheck can't pay their rent it was all done on purpose no they were
[2:44:55.840 --> 2:44:59.280]  clearly getting the riding ready we said that was coming next and so see and this is what you
[2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:03.520]  think mass shooting comes next i think i think attacks on infrastructure i think it's going to
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:08.160]  be both but here's what here's what we're not seeing done correctly and i don't even know what
[2:45:08.160 --> 2:45:12.880]  the president can do he's so his hands are so tied in this deal but look oh yeah folks are mad
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:18.080]  that he's in a bunker that's where you run well that's not a system yeah the trumps is staying out
[2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:22.720]  of this right now because what is he supposed to do in fact john john is over there he's mad at
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:26.880]  trump and i'm not blaming him bring him a wireless mic run the boom what should trump do is john i'm
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:31.360]  not mad at you i'm asking somebody get john a mic but here here's here's what i think trump you
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:37.120]  don't get john a mic i'm gonna smash i'll answer that question first alex trump needs to go after
[2:45:37.120 --> 2:45:42.080]  the deep state running this whole damn thing obama needs to be behind bars i'm sick of this
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:47.280]  damn thing i don't arrest former president says he committed damn treason they would kill trump
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:51.440]  dinner than a hammer tomorrow if they could why do we play games with these commies i'm sorry i'm
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:55.600]  sick no no that's it you're right we're in a war we're not in a normal situation and that's what
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:45:59.520]  it comes down to is we've been brought into this so get you're gonna get by the way obama did you
[2:45:59.520 --> 2:46:04.560]  see obama's new piece no no no no no what was it obama right and wrote a new piece today how we
[2:46:04.560 --> 2:46:09.280]  need more activism we got to get back out in the streets yeah more community organizing more new

[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:43.360]  my only friends the end of our elaborate plans the end of everything that stands the end
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:51.440]  the safety the delusion it's all over ladies and gentlemen because it was only the mirage
[2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:57.840]  of safety movies and partying and living like children never growing up never caring about
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:04.320]  other people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history book show us just
[2:49:04.320 --> 2:49:08.880]  like the bible states every time israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from god
[2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:15.440]  never brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were
[2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:21.680]  infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved we are repeating that again today compliance
[2:49:22.240 --> 2:49:28.240]  and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided to
[2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:32.960]  fight for freedom info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:41.520]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:49.040]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the bill
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:56.400]  millen the gates foundation in full control many will submit through fear others will be bought off
[2:49:56.400 --> 2:50:02.560]  but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post-human world and now that we're
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:09.840]  inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its end game submission to this
[2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:17.120]  is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:23.360]  hell that cannot be imagined until you actually experience in this this is your dignity your
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:30.240]  soul your future being poured inside out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:40.240]  of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:50.240]  so
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:59.040]  well michael cargill had armed men attack his gun shop in south australia last night
[2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:05.200]  other gun shops got raided by criminals others got attacked we came to say their names it's not
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:13.120]  public yet next segment john who runs the boom has been upset at trump he'll be popping in with us
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:16.000]  he's the cleared war on trump now but seriously cargill
[2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:24.320]  what else do you want to impart the listeners about where we are you know it's it this is the
[2:51:24.320 --> 2:51:30.720]  time that you this whole pandemic thing really upset me because when people were trying to
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:36.640]  purchase firearms you had the atf the nicks delaying people from the transactions for over
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:41.840]  30 days you have things that are happening right now that should not be happening you have uh
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:45.760]  our different eight government agencies that are just violating the law the brady law and things of
[2:51:45.760 --> 2:51:50.240]  that nature you when you walk into a gun store to buy a gun and you get delayed you should only
[2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:54.480]  be delayed three business days you should not be delayed 30 days or two they're violating the law
[2:51:55.200 --> 2:51:58.960]  and so yeah and so that you know things like that because the law says if they can't
[2:51:58.960 --> 2:52:02.880]  do it then it default turns off right right so after three business days you get the gun
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:08.080]  and so that that's how it should happen and we shouldn't be 20 days out 30 days out
[2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:12.400]  and you're still waiting to see if you can get your firearm it that's not what the law says
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:16.960]  and so you you're going to have out of this pandemic out of these the protests that we're
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:20.640]  having right now these riots you're going to have some type of legislation come out they're
[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:24.720]  going to give themselves some special powers to be able to do something you've already seen it
[2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:31.840]  happen with uh the you know given special powers to what the fbi to be able to you know look at your
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:37.120]  your browsing information and so more stuff without a warrant yeah more stuff will come out
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:41.280]  do those dumbasses that were trying to break in your business playing like they were all gangsters
[2:52:41.840 --> 2:52:44.800]  realize that you were like 30 seconds away from the end of their world
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:49.040]  they know they had they didn't have a clue didn't have a clue uh they better hug their
[2:52:49.040 --> 2:52:56.080]  mothers tonight and thank the lord that i didn't make their make it there 30 seconds earlier and
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:53:00.480]  i think all the people writing and looting and protesting need to be thanking their lucky stars
[2:53:00.480 --> 2:53:04.160]  that this isn't really popped off yet and i don't think any none of us wanted to
[2:53:04.720 --> 2:53:08.080]  but no exactly i don't have anything to prove these people keep looking for a fight man they're
[2:53:08.080 --> 2:53:12.640]  like well it won't even be us i mean look we're i mean if they want to come here it'll be us but
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:17.360]  it'll be the business owners alex it'll be it'll be the police eventually a police officer is going
[2:53:17.360 --> 2:53:21.120]  to step up and say you know what i'm going to stop you from looting this he's going to shoot him and
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:25.280]  it's going to be another national discussion and the media will make so many deaths it won't get
[2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:30.240]  picked up and and the media see this is what is really upsetting me alex we want to point the
[2:53:30.240 --> 2:53:34.320]  fingers at all these people the police or white people or these people okay you know what everybody
[2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:39.920]  has issues look at look at the damn media they just faked a pandemic and they're going to get
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:44.240]  away with it they literally faked a pandemic man they took away everything they took away
[2:53:44.240 --> 2:53:49.680]  people's livelihoods everything they're they took away their decades to turn this they took away
[2:53:49.680 --> 2:53:54.320]  their confidence just to walk outside their house and breathe air i mean there's a total
[2:53:54.320 --> 2:53:59.680]  crime against humanity and what is the truth alex the truth is it came out of a bio research lab
[2:53:59.680 --> 2:54:04.960]  in wuhan china obama transferred the material foul cheap and by the way yeah when it got out it was
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:09.920]  really bad it went directly to italy because there's a direct trade there between fake uh you know
[2:54:09.920 --> 2:54:13.840]  italian purses they claim are made in italy even though they're really cheap chinese products but
[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:18.720]  they make them and so they had direct flights going there okay there was an outbreak once it mutated
[2:54:18.720 --> 2:54:22.240]  after about a month it was barely deadly at all now people get it they don't even have a damn
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:26.960]  symptom but the media won't tell you any of that because they faked a pandemic and now they're getting
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:31.760]  their real roots what do you make of the german interior ministry saying it's all a hoax this is
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:36.240]  big ooh you know what i make of it alex i make it the same thing i've made of everything for
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:41.520]  for a long time now and that's you know what we told you before everyone else when are you
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:46.480]  gonna start listening when is trump's administration gonna start listening to info wars who is
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.880]  yeah alex honestly like we're so on the cutting edge it almost hurts it's like it almost makes
[2:54:50.880 --> 2:54:56.880]  you sick it's kind of like you know being on like a one track roller coaster and you know you know
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:01.120]  you're about to go down that hill and it's your stomach's gonna drop i mean that's like it that's
[2:55:01.120 --> 2:55:06.080]  like what it is for us all the damn time and it's a bit it's it's almost nauseating alex i'm gonna
[2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:11.760]  be honest it's it's nauseating half the time knowing what we know and and and seeing no action let's
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:17.280]  not be mean imagine being the average person in his administration's like 70 and they just came
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:20.800]  from a different world they cannot believe we're at least a little bit younger so we can deal with
[2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:25.440]  us they just they just can't deal with it man they just can't understand it or even honestly and
[2:55:25.440 --> 2:55:28.720]  same thing with the people out here on the streets riding and everything they can't deal with it
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.280]  either man they don't they don't have a clue i feel bad for them well imagine if they successfully
[2:55:33.280 --> 2:55:38.720]  shut down civilization what they'll be thinking about but let's come back let's come back with
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:44.000]  this video we've been talking about with mr. cargill and mr. shorty memorial day is here
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:48.400]  it's one of the biggest sales of the year and we were already running a huge sale but we're
[2:55:48.400 --> 2:55:52.080]  having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out but all the items we have left
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:57.520]  in stock are still on record sale and then five items that weren't on sale we got back in stock
[2:55:57.520 --> 2:56:03.120]  they're also massively discounted as well for the memorial day special so here it is super male

[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:34.480]  day again thank you all for watching we appreciate your support your financial support but it's also
[2:56:34.480 --> 2:56:38.000]  supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:40.560]  again thank you all for your support we are all in this together
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:57.200]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:57:00.560 --> 2:57:07.200]  all right john is operating the boom camera right now and he's mad at trump he said trump's in a
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:14.080]  bunker what is he doing during this whole crisis and i hear you that's because his quote advisors
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:20.080]  are divided obviously what happened this poor black guy we're not for it with the media hyping it
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:26.080]  that's a fraud all the racial attacks on any side we're against it and we've got michael cargill here
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:31.440]  of central texas gunworks that gave us the dramatic footage of guys thugs last night shooting up his
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:37.520]  business trying to break into it other places got robbed others uh were pulsed attacks almost no
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:43.040]  coverage of this which shows you how bad things really are but john go ahead and turn your mic on
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.480]  that we're not a cult here and you know trump's not perfect why are you angry at president trump go
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:54.960]  ahead does he got a good copy we got you i want to know why he's allowing them to burn down a church
[2:57:54.960 --> 2:57:59.520]  like a hundred yards from the white house and then not doing anything about it doesn't
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:03.360]  doesn't that seem like well that's another thing we had a bunch of churches burned because they had
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:08.960]  services with the whole covet night i mean i mean i hear you so what should this is that the secret
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:14.480]  service here's a problem is the secret service jurisdiction and i'm and listen i get once we
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:18.320]  get rid of jurisdiction we got a big problem but i'm just saying how is it the secret services
[2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:24.000]  jurisdiction i just think it's dangerous to let them get that close to the you know pretty much
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:31.280]  the most protected place in the country and uh it just it encourages them nationwide well i think
[2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:35.840]  that's going to be more in the dc mayor though you know i think i know i think i know the answer
[2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:40.320]  though if there if any of this falls on on trump or or the people inside the white house with them
[2:58:40.320 --> 2:58:44.080]  i know what their approach to this is their approach to this this is how they think and this is what
[2:58:44.080 --> 2:58:48.400]  i'm let everybody act bad and then i'll make them look bad but it's but it's it's really it's it's
[2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:53.200]  more than that it's it's two things and they're placating to the liberal media and that's what
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:57.760]  makes me so mad about this the first thing they say is we can't go after obama we don't do that to
[2:58:57.760 --> 2:59:01.840]  us presidents well iris run to that they would do that to trump in a heartbeat they'd put a bullet
[2:59:01.840 --> 2:59:06.560]  in trump's head tomorrow if they could why are we giving them any of the graciousness they would not
[2:59:06.560 --> 2:59:11.120]  give to trump and then here's the second one which they could always say and always get away with
[2:59:11.120 --> 2:59:16.560]  it won't work anymore they say if you arrest obama they will riot well guess what they're already
[2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:22.320]  rioting so what is holding trump back from arresting obama and brennan and clapper and combi and
[2:59:22.320 --> 2:59:28.240]  right i agree until trump takes action against the deep state it only encourages let me ask cargo
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:35.040]  this michael what's the next escalation i've asked oh and that i mean not acting i get hoping they
[2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:40.240]  just go away hoping this stops obviously trump's trying to be a good president but it the left
[2:59:40.240 --> 2:59:45.040]  just only escalates so in a way it becomes a dereliction of duty if trump doesn't take action
[2:59:45.040 --> 2:59:49.120]  but then what is that action to not look like a dictator because when folks are trying to create
[2:59:49.120 --> 2:59:54.640]  civil war and marshal law and all this you respond to the only way to respond to it would be something
[2:59:54.640 --> 3:00:00.320]  very draconian yeah you know the corona virus is over that's all done so now we moved on to riots
[3:00:00.320 --> 3:00:03.600]  and now they're gonna have to just like oh and said they're gonna have to escalate it to something
[3:00:03.600 --> 3:00:07.600]  else there's gonna have to be some type of mass incident where there's a shooting or something
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:12.000]  like that some kind of mass incident is gonna stay someone to drive a truck through a protest or
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:19.760]  something so so so what do you but i mean so as what should trump do well this is not a it's not
[3:00:19.760 --> 3:00:23.440]  a whole bunch you can do you're gonna have to unfortunately at this point we're gonna have
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:28.160]  to bring in national guard which i don't like and you're gonna have to you know shut it down
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:31.840]  and stop this if the local law enforcement are not doing it the mayors are not allowed and then
[3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:36.400]  they're exactly in the globalist are hoping national guard goes too far and shoots at women
[3:00:36.400 --> 3:00:42.400]  on their porches right man not a good move not a very not a good mood at all not a good mood at all
[3:00:42.400 --> 3:00:46.480]  so do you think so do you think the move for trump is to really take the bully pulpit and
[3:00:46.480 --> 3:00:50.640]  place the blame on democrat leadership which is totally act i think that's the answer just to
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:55.760]  say hey look i'm sorry us cities are burning i know you're upset but look at the mayor of chicago
[3:00:55.760 --> 3:01:00.480]  lightfoot who said stay indoors or we'll arrest you until people started looting and burning things
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:04.560]  and and and riding then nobody got arrested or you can let the people handle it you know once
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:08.240]  the people are tired of you know putting up with this stuff and then hey you don't have to worry
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:12.080]  about them coming after your guns anymore because everyone's gonna want a gun people and that's
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:16.720]  what we're already seeing we're seeing people right now that have never wanted gun never wanted a
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.760]  gun at all they're now walking into a gun store saying hey i want to learn how to shoot i want
[3:01:21.760 --> 3:01:25.440]  to purchase a firearm and and that's what i'm seeing happening right now well and we were
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.920]  about to say in california i mean because they vote against guns now they're all getting their
[3:01:29.920 --> 3:01:33.760]  business is looted they probably want guns more than anybody i was about to say uh michael what's the
[3:01:33.760 --> 3:01:39.600]  parallax for you because that's what i mean i i know a lot of liberals that are like apologizing
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:44.240]  going okay i bought a gun you're right what are we doing i'm like i'm i'm telling you the bill
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:49.840]  rights constitution is is common sense protection but now that may be eroded but i agree with you
[3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:54.160]  what do you think the inverse of this is or the blowback now that people see the police can't
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:59.600]  protect you you're what you're saying you're going to see and i'm already seeing this i there
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:04.560]  are people that argued with me they would just staunch against firearms all together didn't
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:10.400]  want to have anything to do with a gun whatsoever i'm seeing them right now call me contact me
[3:02:10.400 --> 3:02:14.960]  send me a message on facebook twitter whatever and they're saying hey i'm interested in getting
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:21.520]  you know this type of gun here at 22 a 45 a glock 19 um an ar-15 i need to get myself a smith
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:26.480]  and weston m and p you know sport too i need to get something for home protection what do you
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:30.320]  think the best gun is to get you know for home protection should i get a handgun should i get
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.640]  a rifle should i get a shotgun i'm saying you need to get an ar that's going to be the best thing
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:40.960]  get yourself an ar make sure you got at least you know a few thousand rounds and because that's
[3:02:40.960 --> 3:02:44.640]  the only thing that's going to protect you and by the way i had house my parents had liberal
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:49.840]  friends were major newspaper editors my dad had like a gun safe you know a gun closet in one
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:53.600]  area they could see them they would get scared of those guns i just feel good that you're there
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:58.480]  with that ar-15 or m4 absolutely like like what since when do we not trust citizens with guns
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:04.640]  we should you know and i'm i'm actually personally i'm more uh proficient with the an ar than i am
[3:03:04.640 --> 3:03:09.600]  a handgun you know i tell us about the particular ar you got oh yeah absolutely so this right here
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:15.840]  this is it's it's for the people you know that complain about firearms in the first place so
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:20.400]  this one i'm going to flip this sucker over you can shine down on this uh it's a snowflake
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:26.080]  it's a spikes tactical uh with a has a little snowflake emblem on it you know so those people
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:30.880]  that were you know they're afraid of guns uh just that's nice they gave him one for him that little
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:36.560]  unicorn yeah got a little unicorn on it i like all those snowflakes out there so hey snowflakes
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:40.800]  have a second amendment too that's right and you are seeing snowflakes now get gone so we're
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:47.040]  seeing a lot of snowflakes now they're getting guns now isn't that crazy is that not crazy why do you
[3:03:47.040 --> 3:03:51.840]  think they they think to fight us they got to get guns don't don't they get they just joined us
[3:03:52.640 --> 3:03:57.200]  yeah well you you like i said you have people that are they're wanting to get that training now
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:02.880]  they want to learn uh the basics uh of of fire on morning i see that's a really pretty rifle yeah
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:08.320]  they want it you know they want to learn all that stuff get all that stuff out there that's no flake
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:13.360]  i'll actually want a snowflake rifle because like you know all the greek helmets and stuff
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:18.000]  aren't cool but a little unicorn that's kind of cool that suits you alex can i come get a little
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:22.640]  unicorn gun absolutely i bought a few guns from you yeah yeah you have you got a ton of guns from us
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:29.440]  well it's a ton if you knew how much i got a little too many but you know it's it's funny that
[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:33.760]  you mentioned that alex and i know that i know that michael feels the same way based on his
[3:04:33.760 --> 3:04:39.120]  testimony earlier when he talks about protecting his store what was the first thing he said he
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:42.960]  didn't mention the guns that could have potentially been stolen he said i want to make sure my
[3:04:42.960 --> 3:04:46.480]  my employees are safe i got to make sure that the people in there are safe you know i got to
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:51.280]  protect them you know you have that same mindset here you know you you hire security you make sure
[3:04:51.280 --> 3:04:55.760]  that we're safe here i i have the same measurement i the reason why i come every day on air to the
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:05:00.640]  war room with this pistol at my hip is because if something happens here i want to protect the crew
[3:05:01.120 --> 3:05:05.760]  i mean and we're in a dangerous climate let's not lie we're in a we're in a war for america i
[3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:09.680]  know that's right that's right that's right i mean we're not trying to put put a picture on this
[3:05:09.680 --> 3:05:14.960]  like it's it's an epic folks it's epic no turn the tv on everything i have to tell you yeah the real
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:18.000]  people that on the front line you have your your private security those are the people that are

[3:05:21.360 --> 3:05:25.760]  from those guys that are working downtown well we now know before we got security two years ago we
[3:05:25.760 --> 3:05:29.760]  had a lot of harassment a lot of problems since we did they went away we learned it was all coordinated

[3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:51.760]  buying storeable food because i'm worried about the covid-19 virus i'm worried about the food
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:56.720]  shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's
[3:06:56.720 --> 3:07:01.360]  already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the united states and it's
[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:05.680]  even worse in the third world so i hope trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but
[3:07:05.680 --> 3:07:10.960]  with the election fraud and the covid-19 all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:16.400]  else is going on now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years they're

[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:49.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:08.480]  waging war on corruption it's gerald solente you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:16.080]  it's getting me a dog hello hello great being on the alex jones show and what a time it is
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:23.760]  oh how sad what's going on my love so as you well know i had forecast the greatest depression
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:35.440]  let's see it was a year ago march on david night show and of course it was escalated because of the
[3:09:35.440 --> 3:09:45.840]  COVID crisis the hysteria crisis that was created by politicians and now of course COVID is out of
[3:09:45.840 --> 3:09:59.280]  the news and the riots and protests from the killing of george floyd are now the major news
[3:09:59.280 --> 3:10:08.000]  the convergence of these two issues are beyond what anybody could predict
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:15.200]  people say i'm a futurist i sound no futurist there are too many wild cards
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:24.560]  whether they're man-made or made by nature and we just saw two wild cards played
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:32.240]  one of course is the COVID hysteria while it was made by whoever the
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:35.760]  prostitutes built it up into something way larger than it is
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:46.160]  you look at the numbers and the news from around the world and you can see how deadly
[3:10:46.160 --> 3:10:56.960]  the COVID crisis is in terms of the amount of people that it's going to kill
[3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:06.160]  people going hungry pandemic effectively 54 americans without food this just came out yesterday
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:12.880]  a record number of americans face hunger this year as the catastrophic economic fallout
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:19.120]  as the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic
[3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:24.000]  looks to leave tens of millions of people unable to buy enough food to feed their families
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:33.520]  this is prestitute bs it's not the catastrophic economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:43.040]  it's the catastrophic economic fallout caused by low-life pieces of garbage scum crap
[3:11:44.160 --> 3:11:51.200]  called politicians poly ticks many ticks sucking the life and blood out of us
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:57.520]  the deaths of the coronavirus as we've been reporting in the trends journal since it
[3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:06.160]  should hysteria broke out adds up to a bad flu season in terms of the amount of people
[3:12:06.160 --> 3:12:09.680]  that's killed in the united states and around the world
[3:12:12.400 --> 3:12:19.920]  the politicians closed down the economy and now of course with the black people out on the
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:25.280]  streets and who did this affect the hardest when they closed down things and by the way
[3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:30.480]  more people died in proportion blacks and Hispanics than any other group
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:34.640]  and now they're out of work
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:48.640]  the hospitality sector is dead now you have one city and one state after another
[3:12:48.640 --> 3:12:58.560]  being locked down and as you see the violence whether it's dr poll Craig Roberts
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:08.320]  whether it's alex jones or whether it's the financial times which i subscribe to
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:13.760]  politicians blame outsiders for us riots
[3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:21.600]  the internet has chastened christened him umbrella man a video shows him wearing a gas mask
[3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:28.000]  strolling along the windows of an auto supply store in minneapolis and knocking them out with a
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:37.280]  hammer and one after another and of course they're blaming it on who most likely it is
[3:13:37.280 --> 3:13:45.680]  is the antifa antifascist activists antifuture antivia
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:49.280]  it's out of control
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:14:00.880]  this is going to be worse than it was when i was a youth well almost back in the late 1960s
[3:14:00.880 --> 3:14:11.840]  actually i was 22 years old 1968 when the riots demonstrations broke across the country
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:22.560]  but it was very different back then it was no depression going on people were still working
[3:14:22.560 --> 3:14:32.480]  as bad as it was and now they've closed down the global economy these little slimy low life
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:41.200]  pieces of garbage crap who made this stuff up social distancing the new york cops
[3:14:41.200 --> 3:14:51.360]  arresting people are finding them i should say but not socially distancing well there's no social
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:15:06.000]  distancing going on as these riots and protests are going on stand six feet away wear a mask we'll
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:14.080]  we can and the morons are going to swallow it just like they hile hitler marched to musilini
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:23.280]  and salute stalin they follow quomo bow down to gruesome nuesome look up to a conty in italy and
[3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:34.320]  asan ches in spain a merkel in germany and follow their orders the global economy is in the greatest
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:44.400]  oppression with now these riots and protests escalating around the united states this is
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:55.840]  going to be a summer that will be remembered in history it can be changed and one of the ways of
[3:15:55.840 --> 3:16:01.200]  doing it people say to me salenti you say what's going on but you don't give solutions that's not
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:09.440]  true i get many of them open up the economies as soon as possible get people off the streets and back
[3:16:09.440 --> 3:16:20.880]  to work start a new program work progress administration get the people off the streets
[3:16:20.880 --> 3:16:32.320]  and rebuilding our third world infrastructure and most of all push for peace we need a real peace
[3:16:32.320 --> 3:16:39.840]  movement i'm not talking only about the wars abroad but the civil war that's going to break
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:51.200]  out in america the covid war and the civil war our new trends journal will be out tomorrow
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:59.040]  and the artwork done by anthony frida two gas tanks you buy you know those two gallon ones being
[3:16:59.040 --> 3:17:09.360]  poured over and everything on fire in media and politicians pouring the gas on it dividing us
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:24.080]  dividing us causing hysteria the covid war and civil war 2.0 if we don't unite for peace and
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:37.440]  harmony and real justice and beauty we're gonna go down hard and fast we'll be right back stay
[3:17:37.440 --> 3:17:43.440]  tuned now it's official the united nations came out yesterday and said the covid emergency will
[3:17:43.440 --> 3:17:49.760]  last five years and the uk government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be
[3:17:49.760 --> 3:17:54.400]  arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a
[3:17:54.400 --> 3:18:00.320]  list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently

[3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:13.280]  jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner
[3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:18.400]  from the beginning of my research it was clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group
[3:18:18.400 --> 3:18:24.080]  they have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game which is
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:32.000]  global depopulation so you see submitting to them is death the only way to stop them is to expose
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:40.400]  them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy wake up or die as men age

[3:21:33.680 --> 3:21:39.200]  is a year that no one could have predicted it'd be so out of control as we are right now
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:46.160]  now this lockdown of the governments locked down by the governments of businesses around the world
[3:21:46.800 --> 3:21:54.880]  is devastating just as i say just as these psychopaths start wars with no exit strategy
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:22:00.400]  they started the covid war and all bragged about calling it the covid war with no exit strategy
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:11.440]  and now with the killing of george floyd by that cop in pencil in minnesota i mean yeah
[3:22:12.240 --> 3:22:20.000]  minneapolis it's going to be much worse again because the people that are being hit the hardest
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:25.200]  or at the lowest level throughout the crisis lower income people have struggled more with
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:31.600]  unemployment food scarcity low wage jobs that don't allow them to work from home and that
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:37.760]  off a few financial and physical protections the findings by you ready
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:47.040]  the census bureau echo growing evidence of accumulating mental harm among americans
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:52.800]  nearly half of americans reported the coronavirus crisis is impairing their mental health
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:56.720]  health according to the keiser family foundation poll released in april
[3:22:57.680 --> 3:23:03.520]  the survey by the american foundation for suicide prevention found people are experiencing anxiety
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:09.840]  and sadness more often than before the pandemic and they are talking about mental health issues
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:15.760]  more frequently researchers have projected that without intervention the country is poised to
[3:23:15.760 --> 3:23:23.600]  experience horizon suicide substance abuse and overdose deaths again the language they use here
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:33.440]  they're experiencing anxiety and sadness more often than before the pandemic it's not the pandemic
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:46.240]  it's the politicians blame the politicians for what they've done they've destroyed the global economy
[3:23:46.720 --> 3:23:52.480]  again this is unprecedented with all of these states closing down
[3:23:52.480 --> 3:24:02.720]  where alex jones is over there texas arizona georgia missouri minnesota have all declared
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:10.080]  statewide states of emergency over the ongoing protests is from insider dot com
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:22.480]  one after another so now the businesses were closed down already because of the slimy low life
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:25.920]  moronic politicians that decided to do it
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:33.760]  and now states of emergency closing them down even further
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:44.800]  and who is it going to hurt the most you know the lower income you are the harder hits
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:47.040]  and it's just a fact
[3:24:49.920 --> 3:24:54.320]  and why is there violence like this why is there police violence people violence
[3:24:55.680 --> 3:24:57.360]  the fish rots from the head down
[3:24:57.360 --> 3:25:06.240]  now i don't like that kadafi i want him out of there said the nobel piece of craft prize winner
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:12.880]  obama i don't like that guy uh who's saying i want him out of there i'll make up a story
[3:25:12.880 --> 3:25:20.880]  of why he should be killed and all the throne said george w bush i want that guy malosevich
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:33.440]  out of there said clinton i want that guy solomony out of there said trump
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:41.360]  so violence could happen at the top it just sweeps down
[3:25:41.360 --> 3:25:49.040]  and again that's only the way i see it in the model of the trends journalists think for yourself
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:55.440]  and i have to say we've been on top of this right from the start
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:02.480]  knowing what was going to happen and how bad it would be and we warned about these riots and protests
[3:26:04.160 --> 3:26:07.680]  go back and read them we said a flashpoint incident
[3:26:07.680 --> 3:26:15.680]  would trigger it and now that flashpoint incident has when people lose everything and i'm nothing
[3:26:15.680 --> 3:26:21.440]  left to lose they lose it and now of course with the agents provocateurs making it worse
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:27.520]  they do it all the time name the country you know people forgot particularly those liberals
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:32.800]  it was a thing going back in the late 1990s i was believe it was 1999
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:38.080]  when uh slick willy clinton was uh president
[3:26:40.160 --> 3:26:44.880]  the battle of seattle hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets you know what
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:51.120]  they were protesting the world trade organization they're going to have a meeting there because
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:57.760]  they knew we'd lose all our jobs and there you sort these guys you know in great shape
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:03.600]  lean and mean all dressed in black can't see their face
[3:27:05.920 --> 3:27:07.200]  smashing windows
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:21.440]  that's where the focus went not on all the people that were demonstrating peacefully
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:29.280]  but for the agents provocateurs and that's what's going on
[3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:42.480]  the covid hysteria created by the prostitutes has not killed the two million people
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:47.360]  that another little slimy piece of garbage crap over there in the uk
[3:27:47.360 --> 3:27:56.400]  the f you know what k the guy ferguson from the imperial college the imperial college
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:03.600]  imperial far greater than us the slimy little piece of crap said two million of us would be
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:11.040]  dead by the virus and they keep quoting that lousy slimy nothing little college
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:19.440]  of more disaster ahead and another little jerk fouchy
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:27.120]  jaw that's what fouchy means in italian jaw the jaw boner
[3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:39.280]  that sell in fear and hysteria the expert another lying little piece of stupid crap
[3:28:41.120 --> 3:28:49.600]  they closed down our economy for nothing because their power hungry and they've destroyed it
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:58.480]  German officials leak report denouncing corona as a global false alarm
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:09.760]  not printed in the mainstream media a fact this isn't native this isn't a conspiracy theory
[3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:19.120]  suck a burg or gorsi dorsi your other little all your little boys were the first ones to
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:29.360]  close down the economy we're gonna have everybody work from home the meek little geeks not a man
[3:29:29.360 --> 3:29:43.760]  among you all based on your lies and now look what you've done you've destroyed america
[3:29:45.840 --> 3:29:47.520]  at levels we haven't seen
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:56.480]  the coveted war and now civil war 2.0
[3:30:01.920 --> 3:30:09.440]  i'm a visionary i've written books trends 2000 trend tracking a magazine now since 1991
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:15.520]  i'll put my work up against anybody's just show me what you got if you don't have the data that i
[3:30:15.520 --> 3:30:22.320]  have in the compilation i don't want to talk to you but i can tell you this but we're going to see
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:30.880]  next is unprecedented in world history and we come back we're going to talk more about it
[3:30:31.840 --> 3:30:40.480]  in the meantime who you can support it for wars the panic that has been orchestrated by the global
[3:30:40.480 --> 3:30:47.440]  corporatist media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're
[3:30:47.440 --> 3:30:52.400]  already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world but it's critical
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:58.720]  to understand that the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of
[3:30:58.720 --> 3:31:04.320]  shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what
[3:31:04.320 --> 3:31:08.560]  we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the
[3:31:08.560 --> 3:31:14.400]  globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of
[3:31:14.400 --> 3:31:21.440]  this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:26.960]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan
[3:31:26.960 --> 3:31:32.080]  and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them carry it out is a
[3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:37.600]  thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening info
[3:31:37.600 --> 3:31:44.960]  wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom but worldwide maverick spirit
[3:31:44.960 --> 3:31:50.560]  it's not just myself or the host at info wars or the researchers or the journalists it's you the
[3:31:50.560 --> 3:31:56.000]  listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the arena and it's the amazing guests
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:02.240]  and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special because we're not putting a filter
[3:32:02.240 --> 3:32:07.600]  in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about the real state of the world not
[3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:11.920]  the establishment of talking points that are put out by the council in front of relations the boulder
[3:32:11.920 --> 3:32:18.320]  burden group debos group and other club we're pushing for a pro human future where we build a
[3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:25.520]  planet and beyond based on humans for humans by humans not a world where the establishment hate
[3:32:25.520 --> 3:32:31.040]  themselves project their hate onto us and decide we're gonna have a post human world really excited
[3:32:31.040 --> 3:32:36.480]  to know that info wars has your support i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god
[3:32:38.800 --> 3:32:44.640]  what info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth
[3:32:44.640 --> 3:32:52.000]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is the battle for the future of humanity
[3:32:52.560 --> 3:32:59.360]  and now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet
[3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:06.880]  and now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which side
[3:33:06.880 --> 3:33:12.640]  you're on living and denial having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness will only deliver
[3:33:12.640 --> 3:33:19.280]  you into misery destruction and finally death and this is a spiritual death we're talking about
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:26.480]  not just a physical death the delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:30.880]  and we have come so far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order
[3:33:30.880 --> 3:33:37.120]  decide to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our souls
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:44.960]  the united states is not communist china we don't have three million people in concentration camps
[3:33:44.960 --> 3:33:50.800]  we don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs but all of the
[3:33:50.800 --> 3:33:58.400]  news we see the un available indicates who mainstream corporate media praising communist china for
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:03.520]  their response and if communist china shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses
[3:34:03.520 --> 3:34:08.400]  and asks robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it cities like
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:14.080]  san Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say chinese virus well now qualmo in new york's
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:20.240]  calling it the european virus these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose
[3:34:20.240 --> 3:34:25.280]  big time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:31.520]  power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and info wars dot com spread those links and
[3:34:31.520 --> 3:34:36.320]  jam it down the censors throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:47.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:50.880]  quomo who forced people that were in hospitals to go into the nursing homes who had covet 19
[3:38:51.840 --> 3:38:59.360]  the dictator an arrogant boy along with his little brother christy on the cotton news network
[3:39:00.240 --> 3:39:04.640]  two little boys born on third base and thought they had a home run they'd be nowhere
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:14.400]  nowhere if daddy wasn't mario hey qualmo come over here and put a mask on me you're making
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:20.960]  up this mass crap oh by the way he did an interview and he left his mask on the desk after he told

[3:39:27.920 --> 3:39:37.120]  wear a mask i won't go into places no one will be humiliated by it because i also read the data
[3:39:38.240 --> 3:39:43.840]  it's not good for you they don't work like they say they did
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:50.400]  and the centers of disease control flip flopped on it when they got pressure
[3:39:50.400 --> 3:39:59.760]  they're seeing you transjournal anyway so we heard the german official leaked reports
[3:39:59.760 --> 3:40:10.400]  denouncing corona as a global fault salam they went on to say you know what a fact that it was that
[3:40:10.400 --> 3:40:17.280]  the dangers of covid were overestimated probably at no point the danger posed by the new virus
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:23.680]  go beyond the normal level and it's a fact you got it right there and info and then there's
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:33.440]  one that just came out today another conspiracy theory oh this one came from reuters new corona
[3:40:33.440 --> 3:40:41.280]  virus losing potency top italian doctor says the new corona virus is losing its potency and has
[3:40:41.280 --> 3:40:49.280]  become much less lethal as senior italian doctor said on sunday in reality the virus clinically
[3:40:49.280 --> 3:40:59.360]  no longer exists in italy said alberto zangrilo ahead of san rafael hospital in milan
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:09.280]  the swabs that were performed over the last 10 days showed a viral load in quantitative terms
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:15.760]  that was absolutely infinitesimal compared to the ones carried out a month or two months ago
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:25.920]  he told rai television infinitesimal and that's what we have a bunch of infants telling us what to do
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:36.000]  and then you see in italy you go to pompe they're taking temperatures of everybody
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:42.320]  every way you walk in they're taking temperatures they're complaining that people aren't social
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:52.800]  distancing when you see how easy the people follow someone again it's no surprise why
[3:41:52.800 --> 3:42:00.560]  they hile hitler march to mueslini and salute styling the italians were the first ones to
[3:42:00.560 --> 3:42:08.320]  buckle under it was ashamed of them but again good and bad comes in every nationality race creed
[3:42:08.320 --> 3:42:15.600]  color look at that slime of fouchy he's italian not on a main so too was mueslini you know so
[3:42:15.600 --> 3:42:28.480]  good and bad comes in everybody so now this doctor goes on to say we've got to get back to being a
[3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:39.440]  normal country someone has to take responsibility for terrorizing the country they terrorized the
[3:42:39.440 --> 3:42:51.280]  country and they're terrorizing us intelligent people i know i just had a conversation with
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:58.080]  somebody i said look i know the data here i'm not i'm not i'm not involved in politics well i am i
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:03.840]  said okay that's fine that's fine end of the conversation if you line yourself with a poly
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:09.840]  tick the light you like to suck the life out of you knock yourself out no conversation here
[3:43:13.280 --> 3:43:22.160]  if we don't fight for freedom liberty love joy and beauty as i was saying earlier i'm a visionary
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:30.000]  that's my business we have now entered the greatest depression it's gone worldwide the numbers are
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:38.480]  there and now an outbreak of what may become a civil war in the united states but it's not
[3:43:38.480 --> 3:43:45.920]  only in the united states it's global emerging markets collapsing countries going deep into
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:55.440]  recession there were outbreaks before this happened india chile bolivia peru columbia
[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:06.560]  south africa france hong kong lebanon one place after another when people lose everything and
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:12.960]  have nothing left to lose they lose it and now this violence is going to start spreading across
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:20.960]  borders and then you're going to hear some low-life pieces slimy crap politician like a clinton
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:29.840]  or an obama or a murderer bush we got to get over there and stop that government from doing
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:36.800]  what they're doing to their people we're going to send americans over there to kill them like we've
[3:44:36.800 --> 3:44:44.480]  done before but this time it won't work if we don't stop this history is repeating itself
[3:44:45.040 --> 3:44:52.880]  go back to the 1930s currency wars trade wars great depression world war
[3:44:54.800 --> 3:45:01.600]  fast forward now 2020 currency war trade war greatest depression
[3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:11.840]  world war three and it'll be the end the world the war to end all wars as einstein said they'll
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:16.320]  be using sticks and stones to fight the fourth world war he didn't know what they used to fight
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:23.520]  the third so support info wars do what you can to support peace and of course subscribe to the
[3:45:23.520 --> 3:45:35.840]  trends journal the history before it happens
