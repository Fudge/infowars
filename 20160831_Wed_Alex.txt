[00:00.000 --> 00:23.600]  We are on the March the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:23.600 --> 00:33.360]  I want to choose my words very very carefully here and I want everything I
[00:33.360 --> 00:38.000]  say to really cut through all the establishment propaganda and this
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.640]  information this is probably one of the most profound important things I've
[00:43.640 --> 00:54.480]  ever said in my 21 years on air it is completely confirmed that this country
[00:54.480 --> 01:01.800]  has been taken over by foreign multinational corporations who want to
[01:01.800 --> 01:10.360]  pull up the ladder and end the free market system of prosperity and reestablish
[01:10.360 --> 01:22.960]  a form of feudalism and what's profound about that is it's fact not
[01:22.960 --> 01:31.240]  exaggerated not embellished we have been hit by 21st century warfare we have
[01:31.240 --> 01:42.880]  been conquered but just as profound the world is awakening look at the Briggs
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.400]  it look at other nationalist movements across the planet identifying that
[01:48.400 --> 01:53.040]  unelected multinationals through fraudulent trade deals that are actually
[01:53.040 --> 02:04.840]  takeover agreements have seized our nations by fraud and by stealth but that
[02:04.840 --> 02:11.720]  itself is not the profound statement I was about to make it's this in the
[02:11.720 --> 02:22.480]  worldwide resistance to this drudge report Matt drudge Nigel Farage Alex
[02:22.480 --> 02:37.040]  Jones Donald Trump are now the undisputed defenders of the nation state now
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.320]  that isn't a statement to sound arrogant or powerful it's something I don't even
[02:41.320 --> 02:45.440]  want to be in this position it makes my stomach tie up in knots and I'm somebody
[02:45.440 --> 02:53.680]  who's never choked on air we're now approaching a point where it's so surreal
[02:53.680 --> 02:57.760]  and even the mainstream media admits we're the leaders of the opposition
[02:57.760 --> 03:02.920]  that like that's just crediting know what what it's just crediting of is that
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.360]  people are hungry for freedom and hungry to resist tyranny and other men have
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.800]  just stood there and done nothing and been bought off and gone along with this
[03:12.800 --> 03:19.000]  the exciting news is we're having a huge effect that I never in my wildest
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.080]  imaginations going on air 21 years ago thought that I thought I would raise the
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.560]  alarm and then men who were better than me smarter than I more focus with more
[03:29.560 --> 03:37.200]  resources would come to the call to save the country and instead listeners
[03:37.200 --> 03:42.000]  supported us and supported others in the movement and so now the profound
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.520]  statement is without any doubt everybody looking at it prime aphasia on its
[03:47.520 --> 03:53.360]  face we are the resistance and that means you are the resistance you are the
[03:53.360 --> 04:05.400]  power of info wars dot com you are the power of drudge report dot com and we
[04:05.400 --> 04:14.640]  are the resistance now that said everybody's really getting upset right
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.640]  now and they should because homeland security is announcing that they're
[04:18.640 --> 04:27.680]  taking over the control of the elections and that's because we blew their
[04:27.680 --> 04:35.880]  operation wide open a month ago everybody knows again we launched move to
[04:35.880 --> 04:40.280]  get trump come out and point out election fraud and trump took the ball
[04:40.280 --> 04:45.680]  cross the goal line big time in sudden death overtime and they are in full
[04:45.680 --> 04:52.560]  panic right now full panic they're basically declaring martial law over
[04:52.560 --> 04:56.640]  the internet and infrastructure that's what they say in this new executive
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.040]  action this is big we forced them to move their hand Virginia state officials
[05:01.040 --> 05:04.960]  in Richmond say that there are now 40 confirmed cases of hepatitis a that are
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.840]  connected to strawberries used at tropical smoothie locations across the
[05:08.840 --> 05:13.120]  state these berries were imported from Egypt and they contain the hep a virus
[05:13.120 --> 05:16.800]  and they say that other states are affected as well officials encourage
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.200]  anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at a restaurant
[05:20.200 --> 05:24.320]  within the last 50 days to watch for symptoms of hepatitis a now this news
[05:24.320 --> 05:28.160]  comes as president Obama is planning on ramming through the passage of the TPP
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.080]  in coming days the TPP that would irrevocably compromise the safety of
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.720]  our food supply here in the US and immediately open up the floodgates of
[05:35.720 --> 05:40.000]  seafood poultry dairy fruit and vegetable imports to the country while we
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.240]  currently inspect only 2% of all food imports the TPP would also allow foreign
[05:45.240 --> 05:49.680]  companies to compromise food safety decisions and force us inspectors to
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.440]  make new assessments very quickly there are no resources or even a basic
[05:53.440 --> 05:57.120]  agreement in place to make sure that our food supply is safe I'm Margaret

[08:49.160 --> 08:54.160]  about 98% on target out about six months ago on what the globalist would do
[08:54.160 --> 08:59.800]  with our elections now we've gotten into completely crisp focus have a 100%
[08:59.800 --> 09:03.600]  blueprint on what the new world order is going to do
[09:03.600 --> 09:12.280]  first off I want to address a big issue your first because I'm just now
[09:12.280 --> 09:18.120]  completely recognizing this is a humble person and a lot of other people are
[09:18.120 --> 09:26.560]  realizing it and so is the enemy info wars is at the center of resistance to
[09:26.560 --> 09:31.600]  the world corporate takeover known as the new world order we know that but it
[09:31.600 --> 09:37.560]  is at the absolute center of the zeitgeist and that means you the listeners
[09:37.560 --> 09:41.400]  the viewers the people that spread the word the folks that give us the tips you
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.240]  are the heart you are the blood you are the eyes you are the brain you are the
[09:44.240 --> 09:47.800]  bones you're the muscles you're the feet you're the hands you're the fingers
[09:47.800 --> 09:52.080]  you're the nose you're the ears you're the hair you're you're everything you
[09:52.080 --> 09:59.400]  are the info war what's crazy is no one else thought to launch an info war
[09:59.400 --> 10:03.080]  against the globalist or even call it info war no one thought to go get the
[10:03.080 --> 10:06.680]  technologies they were using against us and information warfare and turn it
[10:06.680 --> 10:11.720]  around but load the munitions with truth that's even more powerful and so
[10:11.720 --> 10:20.320]  it's very humbling but it's the truth that drudge report it's like fingers on
[10:20.320 --> 10:32.880]  a hand that you form a fist with drudge report info wars Donald Trump Ron
[10:32.880 --> 10:40.360]  Paul to a certain extent helping lay the groundwork and a constellation of other
[10:40.360 --> 10:50.720]  news organizations and sites and our military it's very awake forms the
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.480]  resistance against the new world order and the counter narratives we're putting
[10:54.480 --> 10:59.320]  out against them are so accurate and so truthful there's no way their system
[10:59.320 --> 11:05.360]  can stand when it's faced with that the probe pedophilia publication salon I
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.560]  mean they are literally pushed by the figure of the pedophiles are good people
[11:10.560 --> 11:14.880]  they're they're mainlining they attack drudge almost every day and they say the
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.760]  drudge factor in 2016 providing rumors scandals and chatter the press is all
[11:19.760 --> 11:22.400]  too eager to eat up and they go on to admit that drudge is setting the
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.760]  narrative no drudge is setting the narrative of common sense which
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.320]  everybody else can see he just has a giant platform to break it down and has
[11:32.320 --> 11:37.680]  the courage to do it and they can't stand it that's why George Soros's memos
[11:37.680 --> 11:42.800]  are now public via the latest hack where he wants UN federally controlled police
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.440]  to shut down the internet for patriots and only let his organization operate
[11:47.440 --> 11:57.720]  that's word for word they have to try to shut us down and it shows really how
[11:57.720 --> 12:02.520]  weak they are that their entire giant media system worldwide and the Pope and
[12:02.520 --> 12:07.280]  the Saudi Royals and the kitchen sink and the Mexican president all these other
[12:07.280 --> 12:13.680]  people attacking us and we're winning the fight for public opinion because we're
[12:13.680 --> 12:21.320]  just promoting common sense and no matter how much they demonize us it just
[12:21.320 --> 12:27.240]  bounces off or even makes us stronger now now that said there's a reason info
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.480]  wars is so successful and it's because we have a memory and we have common sense
[12:33.480 --> 12:38.840]  and it's a great responsibility but when I got up this morning and went info
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.960]  wars.com then drudge report.com I instantly knew what I had to do come in
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.480]  and play the words of Obama and Jay Johnson and others to show you how
[12:49.480 --> 12:58.720]  they're deceiving you. Ladies and gentlemen, Homeland Security is
[12:58.720 --> 13:05.560]  announcing that it is moving to completely take over the elections and
[13:05.560 --> 13:12.560]  guess who's going to have Homeland Security authority in the elections?
[13:12.560 --> 13:24.240]  Guess. The multinational body that founded the United Nations and that
[13:24.240 --> 13:32.080]  basically controls the security agreements in the European Union. The
[13:32.080 --> 13:41.000]  security directive of the OECD that is the technical name of the reorganization
[13:41.000 --> 13:50.320]  project that took place after World War II known as the Marshall Plan. This is
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.240]  when you get down to the bottom layer of what actually runs things. The foreign
[13:54.240 --> 14:01.840]  global multinational system is coming in to run our elections. Now before they
[14:01.840 --> 14:05.160]  let the Associated Press and five other trusted establishment media groups
[14:05.160 --> 14:10.080]  announced the fake numbers whenever they stole elections because we've called it
[14:10.080 --> 14:15.640]  and Trump's called it and we've talked about it. They are being forced now to
[14:15.640 --> 14:20.240]  openly call it infrastructure protection which Homeland Security always said
[14:20.240 --> 14:27.320]  they would do. I told you 15 years ago when they first gave it cabinet level
[14:27.320 --> 14:35.560]  status that Homeland Security was going to openly basically make law by
[14:35.560 --> 14:40.800]  regulations and you'd have to have approval from them to build a barn in
[14:40.800 --> 14:47.960]  your backyard, have a farm, have a job. How did I know that? I watched the C-Span
[14:47.960 --> 14:50.800]  hearings when they were founding Homeland Security. I watched what Governor
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.640]  Ridge said they were going to do and they are now going to run our elections. Now
[14:54.640 --> 15:02.080]  remember Obama said, Alex Jones, you know, Donald Trump, you know, well back
[15:02.080 --> 15:06.800]  then they wouldn't say my name. The Texan, the creature in Texas says that
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.920]  media. The feds aren't involved in elections. Locals run it. Oh really the
[15:13.920 --> 15:18.640]  feds aren't involved in elections. They always were telling the media what
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.080]  returns to put out. Trying to steal elections. Sometimes they weren't
[15:23.080 --> 15:29.160]  successful. Now they're coming in with the you in. That's what this is to run it.
[15:29.160 --> 15:36.200]  And I covered this in great detail last week from Reuters. Reuters. OSCE. That's
[15:36.200 --> 15:43.560]  the security agreement of the OECD. Right's group. Oh, it's a Right's group.
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.560]  Just like all Soros's groups are. Request 500 international observers to
[15:47.560 --> 15:54.640]  monitor US presidential vote 10 times what they did in 2012. And now this from
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.240]  WorldNet Daily, Washington Exam. It's all it's on DrudgeReport.com. It's all been
[15:59.240 --> 16:07.200]  announced openly. Homeland Eye special declaration to take charge of elections.
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.400]  Jay Johnson, the Department of Homeland Security began considering declaring the
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.400]  election a critical infrastructure, which means they're over it and law is
[16:15.400 --> 16:19.800]  suspended under executive orders. We're going to cover all of this in great
[16:19.800 --> 16:25.880]  detail. And we told you it was coming.
[16:26.880 --> 16:32.840]  The internet's handed over October 1st to the UN. Fox News has been coup day
[16:32.840 --> 16:36.800]  taught internally, so they won't challenge fraudulent returns. You see them
[16:36.800 --> 16:43.360]  moving, folks. This is the big one. Trump is way ahead in many polls, neck and neck,
[16:43.360 --> 16:48.200]  even in their fake polls, LA Times polls, he's ahead. They know he's the next
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.480]  president. They're going to try to block it. This is bigger than 1776, because
[16:52.480 --> 16:56.480]  there's seven and a half billion people. We've been overrun by globalist. There's
[16:56.480 --> 16:59.640]  all these weapons systems. The globalists are starting wars with Russia right
[16:59.640 --> 17:06.280]  now. This is an over the top moment, never before seen in history. And I'm
[17:06.280 --> 17:09.760]  sitting here with chills up and down my spine because I have the detailed
[17:09.760 --> 17:13.800]  analysis and breakdown. And I wrote reports. I'm just going to stop right
[17:13.800 --> 17:16.560]  there. I told you I had to take off some time over a month ago and write reports
[17:16.560 --> 17:19.880]  for people. I wrote reports on what I believe they would do. And I got it to
[17:19.880 --> 17:23.920]  the right people, obviously. And I'm telling you exactly what I said is
[17:23.920 --> 17:30.000]  happening. And I'm just like, I'm like doing the work nobody else will do. And
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.560]  I'm not even bragging, but I'm telling you at this point, folks, when it comes
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.960]  to strategy against these people, I mean, I'm right there at the top. And I'm
[17:38.960 --> 17:44.640]  just like, this is insane. That there aren't other men out there that were
[17:44.640 --> 17:50.120]  fighting this. There's Drudge and Joseph Farah and, you know, Donald Trump's got
[17:50.120 --> 17:52.960]  the will to do it. God bless him. Incredible stamina and courage. But I'm
[17:52.960 --> 17:55.600]  just letting you know the list is how important you are and how historic this
[17:55.600 --> 17:58.200]  broadcast is, you understand. Because we're going to do what other people aren't
[17:58.200 --> 18:03.800]  going to do. Common sense. We're going to play J. Johnson first. This is what
[18:03.800 --> 18:06.800]  Homeland Security Director says about Trump and he is going to run the
[18:06.800 --> 18:12.760]  election. I'm going to skip this break. This is so beyond bombshell. This is
[18:12.760 --> 18:18.520]  hydrogen bomb level over the top. He's come out and said you're disqualified.
[18:18.520 --> 18:22.840]  Obama said you're disqualified. You're not allowed to run. You're evil. You're bad.
[18:22.840 --> 18:27.800]  You're un-American. Everything they are. And then they're going to run the
[18:27.800 --> 18:34.440]  election with the corporate group that did the reconstruction of Europe that's
[18:34.440 --> 18:37.200]  funded and run by the Rothschild's Rockefellers and the Globalists, a
[18:37.200 --> 18:42.160]  private combine. I mean, this is the shadow world government, the organization
[18:42.160 --> 18:48.240]  of economic and cooperative development. Use the new world order. It's the IMF.
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.760]  It's the World Bank. It's the WTO. It's the TPP. It's the tentacles. It's the
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.760]  group. It's totally sacred. It's dispatching. It's security services.
[18:57.760 --> 19:05.720]  That's Interpol and Spooks to run our election. It's beyond the UN. The UN is
[19:05.720 --> 19:09.080]  just these little fact totem that it transfers sovereignty to and then it
[19:09.080 --> 19:15.320]  runs, but it's still a front and a fake debating club. This is unbelievable, but
[19:15.320 --> 19:19.640]  I predicted it. You haven't predicted months ago on air. I know the enemy. I
[19:19.640 --> 19:23.360]  know their operations. This is all I do is study them, and I'm not bragging. I'm
[19:23.360 --> 19:30.320]  saying you need to know you are getting the Death Star Plans, period. This is it.
[19:30.320 --> 19:37.520]  And the thing is coming around and it's going to be clear to fire in the next
[19:37.520 --> 19:42.920]  few months. Total world government tyranny is coming in. They're planning a
[19:42.920 --> 19:46.160]  financial collapse after this. That's evident. They're trying to prop up the
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.120]  German banks. They admit they're preparing martial law. Troops in the
[19:49.120 --> 19:53.680]  streets. Germans are already getting the food off the shelves. I mean, you can
[19:53.680 --> 19:58.600]  just see it. They're just running the jihadis in as fast as they can. Oh my
[19:58.600 --> 20:04.400]  God, help us. I don't mean that in vain. I mean, God help us. This is incredible.
[20:04.400 --> 20:09.520]  I'm sure now they're making their big move. This is it, folks. They're going to
[20:09.520 --> 20:12.320]  start wars. They're going to plunge stock markets. They're going to turn
[20:12.320 --> 20:22.560]  paramilitary lose. You decide what side you're on with God right now. The photo
[20:22.560 --> 20:26.560]  on drudgerport.com says it all. It's behind me on screen that we can pull
[20:26.560 --> 20:29.920]  back and show folks them in their big fake Homeland Security situation room
[20:29.920 --> 20:34.120]  where they're spying everybody and all the rest of it, and they're going to run
[20:34.120 --> 20:38.000]  the election. Of course, they were always doing it, but Obama said they
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.800]  weren't. So let's play J. Johnson. This clip is talk about projection. This is
[20:42.800 --> 20:50.080]  it. I believe this that this J. Johnson a few months ago. I believe that it's the
[20:50.080 --> 20:55.360]  responsibility of those of us in national security and Homeland Security
[20:55.360 --> 21:01.120]  when a leading candidate for office proposes something that is irresponsible,
[21:01.120 --> 21:05.400]  probably illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to national law on American
[21:05.400 --> 21:08.840]  and will actually hurt our efforts at Homeland Security and national security.
[21:08.840 --> 21:14.360]  We have to speak out. And he went on to say Donald Trump is disqualified and
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.240]  shouldn't be president. They're the ones doing all this. They're the ones to
[21:17.240 --> 21:19.600]  violate our laws. They're the ones opening our borders. They're the ones
[21:19.600 --> 21:23.240]  involved in all these camps. They're the ones and now everything they say about
[21:23.240 --> 21:27.560]  us is what they're doing and they're going to run the election. But remember
[21:27.560 --> 21:36.400]  going to get Roger Stone on the line. Remember Obama said that the feds aren't
[21:36.400 --> 21:42.640]  involved in elections. He said, what is election fraud? Ha ha. Like it doesn't
[21:42.640 --> 21:47.240]  even exist. This is the complete arrogance of these people. Look, I know you can fix
[21:47.240 --> 21:50.560]  the elections. I know you can get away with basically any crime you want. I get
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.640]  all of that. But you can't go on forever globalist. You're doing it in front of
[21:54.640 --> 21:57.760]  everyone now. And just because you're planning to try to shut down the
[21:57.760 --> 22:01.240]  Internet and have some type of civil emergency to cover your butt, it's not
[22:01.240 --> 22:07.520]  going to work. You people are crazy. And just because you've been put in by the
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.040]  New World Order because you got chips on your shoulders or whatever, just because
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.880]  you call people that want free elections racist doesn't make it so Obama. And
[22:15.880 --> 22:19.720]  you're not allowed to steal elections Obama for Hillary just because you're
[22:19.720 --> 22:26.680]  part African. The political correctness is over. Let's go ahead and play Jay
[22:26.680 --> 22:31.080]  Johnson. This is the guy who's absolutely should recuse himself. He is
[22:31.080 --> 22:36.080]  disqualified. It's a conflict of interest, the most brazen of which we haven't seen
[22:36.080 --> 22:42.040]  in a few months since Loretta Lynch was meeting with Bill Clinton illegally on
[22:42.040 --> 22:47.120]  the airplane. So here's Jay Johnson as the secretary of Homeland Security. I have
[22:47.120 --> 22:53.360]  avoided responding to the political season and what candidates have said
[22:53.360 --> 22:58.640]  running for president. However, I believe that it's the responsibility of those of
[22:58.640 --> 23:03.120]  us in national security and Homeland Security when a leading candidate for
[23:03.120 --> 23:09.200]  office proposes something that is irresponsible, probably legal, unconstitutional,
[23:09.200 --> 23:14.480]  and contrary to international law, un-American, and will actually hurt our
[23:14.480 --> 23:18.440]  efforts at Homeland Security and national security. We have to speak out.
[23:18.440 --> 23:23.200]  And that's Trump wanting to vet Muslims coming in. Oh, you're not checking their
[23:23.200 --> 23:27.680]  IDs and stop them. Well, I can't get in without them checking my passport. Now,
[23:27.680 --> 23:31.880]  this is the guy that's going to run the elections and I told you they're going to
[23:31.880 --> 23:35.000]  try to steal the election because Trump in so many real polls and scientific
[23:35.000 --> 23:42.880]  polls is really ahead. They know this. I told the world, watch. They're involved.
[23:42.880 --> 23:45.760]  They stole it from Sanders. They tried to steal it from Trump and Trump has
[23:45.760 --> 23:49.040]  common sense. He comes out. He's on his own research. He says exactly that and
[23:49.040 --> 23:53.880]  they flip out and say Trump's a cuckoo. We're not going to have the UN and the
[23:53.880 --> 23:59.920]  EU overseeing our election. That's Reuters. And guess who advises them?
[23:59.920 --> 24:06.480]  Soros. We have his own emails. So here is the clip from Obama making fun of
[24:06.480 --> 24:10.640]  myself and Trump saying election fraud. What's that? And saying the feds aren't
[24:10.640 --> 24:16.960]  involved as they move to quote take over the election to take charge of
[24:16.960 --> 24:21.200]  critical infrastructure. That's called martial law when the party in power
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.840]  takes control of the election. This is up. But don't worry, the UN's here to
[24:25.840 --> 24:32.000]  certify it's okay. They admit they're watching Trump and making sure he doesn't
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.640]  try to stop illegals from voting. This is a foreign takeover of America. This is
[24:35.640 --> 24:44.680]  treason emboldened, emblazoned in flame. You are watching history people. Let's
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.160]  play at the Club of Obama. Of course the elections will not be raked. What does that
[24:49.160 --> 24:59.680]  mean? The federal government doesn't run the election process. States and cities
[24:59.680 --> 25:04.960]  and communities all across the country. They're the ones who set up the voting
[25:04.960 --> 25:11.040]  systems and the voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a
[25:11.040 --> 25:21.240]  conspiracy theory that is being propagated across the country, including
[25:21.240 --> 25:30.640]  in places like Texas, where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of
[25:30.640 --> 25:36.400]  voting booths, that's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. And the
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.560]  implies we're saying Texas will be stolen. We're talking about nationally the feds
[25:39.560 --> 25:43.560]  involved. Homeland Security's always been involved the last 15 years. Now they've
[25:43.560 --> 25:47.640]  got 10 times the monitors. They're bringing in foreigners to come do their
[25:47.640 --> 25:53.760]  dirty work. This is like a spy novel on PCP. It's happening. It's in Reuters.
[25:53.760 --> 25:59.560]  They're seizing control. And I tell you what I think Trump has to do right now.
[25:59.560 --> 26:01.720]  We're going to put together the informational videos. You can call
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.120]  them ads, but they're not. They're just support of the First Amendment and the
[26:04.120 --> 26:08.280]  right to vote, where we show Obama saying feds don't run elections and then
[26:08.280 --> 26:11.640]  cut to them announcing that the feds are taking over the elections. And then
[26:11.640 --> 26:15.680]  Trump warning of this and being proven right. I mean, the UN and the EU
[26:15.680 --> 26:19.480]  bureaucrats are going to be here running our elections. Roger Stone at this point,
[26:19.480 --> 26:24.880]  this is so incredible that this is actually happening. This appears like
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.680]  they're completely panicking. They seem completely wild-eyed and desperate. I've
[26:29.680 --> 26:33.880]  never seen such lies. I've never seen such cheerleading in the media for other
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.560]  media to get more intense in lying. Trump is acting presidential, going to New
[26:38.560 --> 26:42.000]  Orleans, going to Louisiana, going to Mexico today to meet with the Mexican
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.680]  president. What in the world is going on here? How can the party in power announce
[26:47.680 --> 26:51.880]  an emergency and seize control of the election, which we already know they were
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.560]  trying to mess with? Sir, what are the words to describe this? Sure. Well, first
[26:56.560 --> 27:01.720]  of all, let's address, Alex, what the president said. We don't even know what
[27:01.720 --> 27:05.480]  election theft is, what voter fraud is. Let me, let me illuminate the president.
[27:05.480 --> 27:11.320]  It is manipulation of the computerized voter machines in wide use in this
[27:11.320 --> 27:17.240]  country, the so-called Daibold or PES machine. We have an authoritative
[27:17.240 --> 27:21.120]  Stanford study that shows that these machines were rigged against Bernie
[27:21.120 --> 27:27.040]  Sanders. We have a study by a Harvard Princeton professor at Powell showing
[27:27.040 --> 27:33.000]  that the machines can be rigged in seven minutes or less. We have a CBS video
[27:33.000 --> 27:40.120]  showing how a $15 device you can buy at Radio Shack or Best Buys can be used to
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.160]  hack these machines and vote multiple times. CBS, not exactly a part of the
[27:45.160 --> 27:51.800]  conservative alt media. So the president is saying in essence, well, he ignores
[27:51.800 --> 27:56.560]  the technology and we're supposed to rely on the integrity of those in the
[27:56.560 --> 28:02.560]  political process not to rig the election, even though it is technologically
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.440]  very possible. Here's what's happened, Alex. Donald Trump has raised this
[28:07.440 --> 28:11.200]  question and more and more Americans are asking whether we're going to have an
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.800]  honest election. This is the establishment's attempt to put a cap on this.
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.520]  I reminded of Ronald Reagan who said the most dangerous words in the English
[28:21.520 --> 28:27.880]  language. I'm from the government and I'm here to help you. You're right. There is
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.760]  no significant role. We need to watch the watchers because that's where this
[28:32.760 --> 28:35.920]  election... And you said that over a month ago. You said, Alex, I'm more concerned
[28:35.920 --> 28:39.920]  about Homeland Security. You said Loretta Lynch and Jay Johnson on this show. We
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.120]  got to find the clip because it's so powerful and show the date because it's
[28:43.120 --> 28:46.720]  just this is this. We are so on target. I'm not even bragging. I just can't believe
[28:46.720 --> 28:51.680]  how on target Drudge is, Trump is, you are, we are. I mean, we are on target. That's
[28:51.680 --> 28:55.320]  why they're crapping their pants. Right. And I think your listeners need to get
[28:55.320 --> 29:01.240]  acclimated. Anytime a speaker or an analyst or somebody in the news or
[29:01.240 --> 29:06.560]  someone who supports Hillary says the words conspiracy theorist or conspiracy
[29:06.560 --> 29:11.320]  theory, that person is lying. Whatever they're telling you is a lie. You see,
[29:11.320 --> 29:16.560]  they can't refute that these machines are hackable. They can't refute that they've
[29:16.560 --> 29:20.480]  been hacked in the past. And they say Donald Trump's disqualified. He's not
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.920]  allowed to be president. The guy running the machines is saying this to us that
[29:23.920 --> 29:26.160]  just let Hillary off. Stay there, sir. You're gonna have the floor when we come back.
[29:26.160 --> 29:28.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, he has a lot of the breaking news,
[29:28.760 --> 29:31.600]  but this is just incredible that this early, I knew Homeland Security was gonna
[29:31.600 --> 29:35.000]  be involved, dealing it. But now they're just like, we have to protect it from
[29:35.000 --> 29:40.040]  hackers. The Russians want to steal it. If Trump wins, the Putin did it. Oh,
[29:40.040 --> 29:42.160]  and let's not forget, I said who's leading the resistance against the New
[29:42.160 --> 29:45.320]  World Order. Front and center, it is Vladimir Putin, because he's a
[29:45.320 --> 29:48.760]  nationalist, folks. He's not in our business. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[29:48.760 --> 29:55.880]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:55.880 --> 30:04.160]  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that
[30:04.160 --> 30:08.080]  they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
[30:08.080 --> 30:12.160]  these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights,
[30:12.160 --> 30:16.480]  governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the
[30:16.480 --> 30:20.240]  consent of the governed. That whenever any form of government becomes
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.560]  destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to
[30:24.560 --> 30:31.000]  abolish it and to institute new government. Independence isn't a day. It's a
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.520]  mindset, an attitude that says, I will not be your dependent. I will not be your
[30:35.520 --> 30:40.440]  slave. Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with
[30:40.440 --> 30:45.360]  gradual infringements. When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent you
[30:45.360 --> 30:51.280]  become their slave. Slaves are never safe. You won't get rich by being a slave.
[30:51.280 --> 30:56.000]  Guard your liberty, regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[30:56.000 --> 31:02.440]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Dyke. More than two years ago, Infowars first told
[31:02.440 --> 31:06.400]  you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy. I've
[31:06.400 --> 31:10.240]  told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies
[31:10.240 --> 31:15.000]  can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of
[31:15.000 --> 31:18.800]  the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the
[31:18.800 --> 31:23.320]  water. They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the
[31:23.320 --> 31:27.680]  Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[31:27.680 --> 31:33.160]  you how to prepare yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information
[31:33.160 --> 31:36.960]  has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[31:36.960 --> 31:41.560]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever
[31:41.560 --> 31:45.520]  concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real
[31:45.520 --> 31:49.360]  deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any
[31:49.360 --> 31:55.080]  optimum health regimen. Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com

[33:02.360 --> 33:13.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. So get ready
[33:13.120 --> 33:16.800]  for the propaganda. You're gonna see it tonight on the news, because it's put up
[33:16.800 --> 33:20.680]  by the White House, regurgitated by media matters, and then loaded the
[33:20.680 --> 33:27.960]  teleprompters from CNN to MSNBC to ABC to NBC. The Russians are gonna steal the
[33:27.960 --> 33:32.280]  election with hackers. They've already started planting these fake seeds, but
[33:32.280 --> 33:38.560]  Homeland Security is gonna go in there and save us from it by sitting over the
[33:38.560 --> 33:47.080]  tabulation. Oh, and by the way, we're gonna use spooks from the most secretive
[33:47.080 --> 33:55.280]  organization there basically is. This is Reuters reporting this. The OSCE, the
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.800]  Security Services Directive Agreement, of the Marshall Plan. Let me say what the
[34:00.800 --> 34:04.960]  Marshall Plan was. Stuff like putting a million Germans in a concentration camp
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.280]  and letting them starve to death. I mean, it was hardcore martial law in Germany
[34:09.280 --> 34:17.000]  and other areas for many years. This is the actual guts of the shadow
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.880]  Robert Barron World Government. And here's Reuters. 500 monitors, 10 times what
[34:21.880 --> 34:27.760]  they had in 2012 with Justice Department power. And I have mainstream news saying
[34:27.760 --> 34:33.640]  the UN to run our police now. Here's this. Obama Administration and UN announced
[34:33.640 --> 34:39.160]  global police force to fight extremism. Wait for it in the US. They're looking at
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.280]  starting a civil war, boys and girls. The entire setup's there. And I know I've
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.960]  been harping on this forever, but this is really happening. I'm gonna go to
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.080]  Roger Stone here because, again, he's the guy that got Donald Trump over the years.
[34:53.080 --> 34:56.080]  Really pushed him to run. Donald, of course, did it himself, former head of his
[34:56.080 --> 35:00.000]  campaign. He knows the amount of Donald Trump. But now it's so clear that Donald
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.440]  Trump is a patriot, is a champion, is a nationalist, and the whole global crime
[35:04.440 --> 35:10.200]  syndicate is doing everything they can to stop it. US News and World Report has
[35:10.200 --> 35:14.600]  articles out about what happens if he dies, then the elections canceled. Very
[35:14.600 --> 35:21.560]  creepy stuff. They are telegraphing threats. This is an over-the-top time to
[35:21.560 --> 35:27.640]  be alive. And just finishing up here, Jay Johnson says, I'm going to disqualify
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.200]  Trump, and now he says, I'm going to run the election. And Obama says, there's no
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.760]  such thing as election fraud. What's that? Besides, the feds don't run elections. As
[35:36.760 --> 35:41.040]  he comes in with executive action, infowars.com, Washington Examiner, World
[35:41.040 --> 35:45.280]  Net Daily, Breitbart, but it's all directly linked to them. Homeland Eyes
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.680]  special declaration to take charge of elections. And now you see the internet
[35:48.680 --> 35:52.320]  being censored. You now see patriots being censored. You now see leaked memos
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.760]  or real Soros planned for federally controlled police themselves directed by
[35:55.760 --> 36:00.200]  the UN. And libertarian and patriot conservative sites not allowed to
[36:00.200 --> 36:06.120]  operate in the web of the future. Kicking us off the web, putting us into
[36:06.120 --> 36:12.600]  non-electronic gulags. Going to Roger Stone, I want to talk about how we stopped
[36:12.600 --> 36:18.440]  this, what we do. For me, Roger, this signifies very, very serious desperation.
[36:18.440 --> 36:23.440]  Even their tweaked polls in the LA Times show him a point or more ahead. A lot of
[36:23.440 --> 36:27.800]  the algorithms, as you know, show him winning handily. I know you like to be
[36:27.800 --> 36:31.920]  a pessimist just to be safe, but am I wrong in saying they're panicking right
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.000]  now? And doesn't this backfire when they all say you're disqualified, you can't be
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.160]  president? And then they come in after Donald and others, as I said earlier, we
[36:40.160 --> 36:44.480]  need to raise this early before they came in and took it over. We raised it, now
[36:44.480 --> 36:50.280]  they come in. This looks like they've really stepped in it, Mr. Stone. Give us
[36:50.280 --> 36:54.840]  your expert analysis. Sure, Alex, what all of this means to me is that they have
[36:54.840 --> 36:59.400]  every intention of trying to rig this election, and they're now trying to put
[36:59.400 --> 37:04.920]  the best possible face on it, dress it up. I think Trump has signaled them very
[37:04.920 --> 37:11.120]  strongly that if he is robbed, he does not intend to walk away. If there is hard,
[37:11.120 --> 37:17.000]  core admissible evidence of a rigged election, that he's going to dispute the
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.600]  election. So they're trying to dress up the results. And you were building an
[37:20.600 --> 37:24.680]  army, and we are building an army, to have exit polls and analysis they know
[37:24.680 --> 37:29.320]  we're serious. Interestingly enough, the only hacking that's going on is the
[37:29.320 --> 37:36.440]  hacking of us. Yesterday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Brown wrote to the FBI
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.520]  demanding that they investigate me in the Russians, which is laughable. Told you
[37:42.520 --> 37:47.880]  that was coming. Regarding whether we have obtained certain Democratic Party
[37:47.880 --> 37:53.560]  documents through hacking, let's be clear. There is no evidence that the Russians
[37:53.560 --> 37:59.400]  have hacked anyone yet. The DNC documents that indicted Deputy Wasserman
[37:59.400 --> 38:04.040]  Schultz, and showed that Hillary stole the nomination from Bernie, came from
[38:04.040 --> 38:10.120]  crucifer two in the original hacking, and then were authenticated by WikiLeaks.
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.440]  No Russian involvement. And Guzo for one was not Russian. Well, look, look, we've
[38:14.440 --> 38:17.880]  now, it's been confirmed that it's actually U.S. intelligence agencies
[38:17.880 --> 38:20.680]  actively doing this because they know there's a foreign takeover of the
[38:20.680 --> 38:25.400]  country. And this is amazing. I mean, this is extraordinary piece in the
[38:25.400 --> 38:30.120]  financial times yesterday, documenting the involvement of the Ukrainian
[38:30.120 --> 38:37.320]  billionaire, Victor Pinchok, his ties to the Clinton campaign and the fraudulent
[38:37.320 --> 38:44.520]  campaign used to smear Paul Manafort, the ledger that alleges payments to
[38:44.520 --> 38:51.400]  Manafort, a forgery by Ukrainian intelligence. Yes, there's foreign
[38:51.400 --> 38:57.320]  interference in our elections, but it's not by the Russians. It's by the paid
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.680]  allies like Soros, like the Ukrainians. Sure, that's a Soros operation. Ukraine
[39:02.680 --> 39:06.120]  is their new headquarters. They've taken it over. They're stealing the gas, stealing
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.560]  the money, stealing the bonds, looting everything. And what did Soros say? He
[39:09.560 --> 39:14.600]  goes, I want to take over Ukraine to get a new Marshall plan that'll fund my
[39:14.600 --> 39:18.440]  operations. He doesn't even hide it. He bankrupts it. He gets the new Marshall
[39:18.440 --> 39:24.680]  plan and then takes over. And really, what's extraordinary here is the
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.640]  hotspot of the Clinton people saying Trump is in bed with Putin when it's the
[39:29.640 --> 39:35.160]  Clintons who sold Putin the control of our uranium production. It's the
[39:35.160 --> 39:40.680]  Clintons who have done favors for the oligarchs who are supporting it. And by
[39:40.680 --> 39:44.760]  the way, even the Huffington Post is reporting this. It's strange they're
[39:44.760 --> 39:48.600]  even telling the truth. I mean, Hillary gets $35 million from the Russians to get
[39:48.600 --> 39:52.200]  one-fifth our uranium. That's treason. Can you imagine you've
[39:53.400 --> 39:56.840]  Trump did something like this? Well, what's amazing here is that your
[39:56.840 --> 40:02.680]  activities, my activities, the folks at stopthesteal.org, the folks who watch
[40:02.680 --> 40:07.400]  info wars, the watchers of Breitbart and Daily Caller and so on, we are under
[40:07.400 --> 40:13.160]  their skin. They attacked you by name last week, the Democratic candidate for
[40:13.160 --> 40:18.120]  president. They attacked me the week before saying that I am a right-wing
[40:18.120 --> 40:25.960]  conspiracy theorist. No, I'm a conspiracy realist, ideal in facts. And the fact is
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.240]  they are prepared to steal this election. They are prepared to rig these machines.
[40:31.240 --> 40:37.480]  The Clinton Foundation is a slush fund and more precisely a vehicle for the
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.680]  facilitation of multi-billion-dollar bribes in which everything in our foreign
[40:42.680 --> 40:48.280]  policy was essentially for sale. So to the extent that there's foreign
[40:48.280 --> 40:53.720]  interference in our elections, it is by Victor Pinchup. Absolutely. And it's
[40:53.720 --> 40:55.880]  admitted. So let's stop right there.
[40:55.880 --> 41:02.520]  This isn't tuning our horn. It's letting the listeners understand this and know this.
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.360]  Infowars.com, Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, a constellation of
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.600]  other groups who deserve credit as well, WorldNet Daily, Daily Caller, Breitbart
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.840]  in a big way. They always try to demonize us and act like we're discredited
[41:16.840 --> 41:19.240]  because they're actually so scared of our narrative because it's actually
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.560]  historical and accurate and what CENTCOM knows is true and what generals all
[41:23.560 --> 41:28.040]  over the place like Flynn and others know. I mean the entire military basically
[41:28.760 --> 41:33.320]  now knows there's a foreign takeover. They get it. They are linking up. They're
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.040]  aware of what's happening and I really think that the folks up top who stole
[41:38.040 --> 41:42.120]  in the country are starting to realize how much trouble they're actually in and
[41:42.120 --> 41:45.240]  how many crimes they've actually committed. As more emails come out that
[41:45.240 --> 41:48.840]  Hillary wasn't just selling access to the president through her foundation,
[41:48.840 --> 41:54.120]  but to the Chinese president. That is a whole nother level of insanity. I mean these
[41:54.120 --> 41:58.200]  people are crazy. Look at how she kept stuff on her private server.
[41:58.200 --> 42:01.320]  Knowing it would be hacked. I mean it does seem like they're incredibly
[42:01.320 --> 42:05.240]  reckless, Roger Stone. What do you make of their position right now and the fact
[42:05.240 --> 42:07.960]  that they tried to demonize you and I and Drudge and others?
[42:08.680 --> 42:12.840]  Trump took all these messages in truth and his own ideas, busted through it all,
[42:13.560 --> 42:18.440]  and now they're in panic mode because everything we've said has been legitimized.
[42:18.440 --> 42:22.440]  The extremists are now the gold standard. We're not the extremists. We're what's left
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.520]  of America. We understand what's happening. So all I'm letting the listeners know is
[42:26.520 --> 42:31.000]  this is the brain trust. Why are they panicking so much? Where do we go next, Roger Stone?
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.880]  Well notice the entire campaign of personal vituperation, personal attacks. You see when
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.280]  they can't refute your arguments and they're worried that you're starting to communicate
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.160]  the truth about how they intend to steal this election and about how the mainstream media
[42:47.160 --> 42:53.160]  is entirely one-sided, you get attacked personally. They've attacked you, they've attacked me,
[42:54.040 --> 42:59.160]  they attack Stephen K. Bannon, manufacturers. They're doing incredibly dirty things behind
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.480]  the scenes right now folks, just so you know. And it's all personal. One of my very close
[43:03.480 --> 43:09.560]  associates, Christian Josie, longtime conservative activist, hacked as soon as he came to work for
[43:09.560 --> 43:17.240]  me. His email, his bank accounts, his social media contacts, all he did was go online and
[43:17.240 --> 43:24.360]  tell the truth. Bill Clinton is a serial sexual predator and Hillary has acted as an accessory.
[43:24.360 --> 43:28.760]  So they're bullying, it's not working. What do they do next? How do these slime bags,
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.200]  these cornered rats, how do, what do they do next? Well, I think it's very clear they're
[43:34.200 --> 43:38.840]  going to continue the war of personal attacks. They're going to try to make Donald Trump into
[43:38.840 --> 43:45.720]  Barry Goldwater in 1964. He's mentally unstable. He's unfit. You predicted that. Now the main
[43:45.720 --> 43:51.000]  drama is he's mentally ill and Hillary obviously is mentally ill. Yeah, it's very clear that
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.200]  anything they say about Trump turns out ironically to be true about their own candidate. Folks will
[43:56.200 --> 44:02.200]  be able to get Trump's measure in these debates. They'll be able to see whether or not he is capable
[44:02.200 --> 44:07.720]  of the big job. He's been very disciplined on the campaign trail. He's been on offense.
[44:07.720 --> 44:14.600]  She's on defense. The polls are closing quickly nationally. There's a little lag in the key
[44:14.600 --> 44:21.000]  states, but the whole point here is this is a viable race. The media is going to be telling us now
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.120]  for the next 60 days. It's over. Trump's a loser. It's going to be a slant landslide.
[44:26.120 --> 44:33.480]  They're trying to set an expectation level for the subsequent rigging of the elections.
[44:33.480 --> 44:38.760]  Read the Stanford study. Read the Princeton study. Read the study by Professor Robert
[44:38.760 --> 44:45.400]  Petrakes at Ohio State Community College. These are learned men. These are not right-wing cooks.
[44:45.400 --> 44:50.920]  They will all tell you how easy it is to rig these machines. Sure, Roger. I understand you
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.280]  do probably 20 interviews a day. I mean, you're killing yourself. You're amazing and you're
[44:54.280 --> 44:57.800]  educating our audience, but our audience is extremely educated on all this. We're talking
[44:57.800 --> 45:02.120]  strategy here with you, my friend, with the actual soldiers, the sergeants, the captains,
[45:02.120 --> 45:05.880]  the colonels, the generals. In so many cases, I mean, literal generals, as you know,
[45:06.440 --> 45:12.680]  that understand we understand they understand we're on target. This is real analysis, real info.
[45:13.560 --> 45:18.840]  We're sitting here in a big basically war encampment around the big table in the tent.
[45:18.840 --> 45:22.760]  Strategy, our strategy, the enemy strategy. We don't have to hide our strategy. We wear it on
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.360]  our shoulder. Tell the truth. But I mean, do you agree with me that the enemy is floundering right
[45:28.360 --> 45:34.600]  now and really making desperate moves, revealing their open plan to bring in multinationals to
[45:34.600 --> 45:40.280]  oversee the election with the Justice Department and the Homeland Security that say they're not
[45:40.280 --> 45:45.080]  going to let Trump be president? This is so naked. Let's talk about that. And then what do we do if
[45:45.080 --> 45:52.040]  they do try to steal it in the battleground states? Well, I think this has several parts, Alex.
[45:52.040 --> 45:56.760]  First of all, they are going to have the full force and budget of the federal government to try
[45:56.760 --> 46:03.480]  to pull off this ruse. And as I said, we have to watch the watchers. So that's the real announcement.
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.120]  Homeland security run by foreign multinationals is announcing they're going to steal the election.
[46:08.120 --> 46:11.240]  I mean, that's all this is they're now announcing. They're going to come in and steal it.
[46:11.960 --> 46:17.240]  And I've now determined that the data center to count all the votes nationally is based
[46:17.240 --> 46:27.480]  in Spain, in Spain, not in the United States. There is there is going to be an ongoing effort
[46:27.480 --> 46:33.720]  to create an expectation level so that the they can pull off the steal more smoothly.
[46:34.280 --> 46:39.240]  The campaign of personal attack and by tupperation is going to continue. It's not going to matter,
[46:39.240 --> 46:43.800]  Alex. I'm not running for president. You're not running for president. She is running.
[46:43.800 --> 46:49.880]  Look, it's an honor to be a lot about attack by total scum. But let's be clear. George Soros is
[46:49.880 --> 46:56.840]  giving the the trainer, misfit David Brock, a man who would make Joseph Goebbels proud when it
[46:56.840 --> 47:02.680]  turns to lies and disinformation, 30 million dollars to go on Twitter, to go on Facebook,
[47:02.680 --> 47:08.680]  to to spread disinformation about us personally, but about this election, about the Clinton
[47:08.680 --> 47:14.840]  Foundation and so on. We have to rely on volunteers. That's why I beseech patriots.
[47:14.840 --> 47:18.680]  Go to stop the steal.org. We need you to volunteer.
[47:18.680 --> 47:21.880]  Trump is building an army. We're building an army. And let's be clear, folks,
[47:22.440 --> 47:26.280]  we're not bragging. We want you to understand this is the equivalent of the X wings going down
[47:26.280 --> 47:31.320]  the trench towards the Death Star. This is history. This is for all the marbles. This is at the
[47:31.320 --> 47:36.440]  highest levels. We are engaging them. I haven't even plugged this hour. Everyone must go to
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.880]  infowarstore.com and get a Hillary for prison shirt at cost $9.95. That includes shipping.
[47:41.880 --> 47:46.520]  Everyone must go there and get a Bill Clinton rape shirt for $19.95. That helps funder operation,
[47:46.520 --> 47:51.320]  helps fund Roger out in the no spinning his own money. We are totally committed, folks. I am
[47:51.320 --> 47:56.120]  ready to go through whatever I have to. Okay. And they've threatened me well. Don't worry.
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.840]  I am 110 percent committed. I've never had private security. I got it right now. Okay.
[48:00.840 --> 48:05.160]  That's the level. In fact, we can show Twitter one of the security guys. He actually runs a
[48:05.160 --> 48:09.160]  large security company and works for one of the top former generals, but I'm going to stop right
[48:09.160 --> 48:15.320]  there. Just understand, ladies and gentlemen, debt. You can go to my Twitter and show folks a cue.
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.200]  This is what we're dealing with. This is real. This isn't going to see in the movie The Godfather
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.680]  where the Mafia is doing stuff. This is real. This is multinationals conquering the country.
[48:24.680 --> 48:29.320]  We need your financial support. You need selenium. We have the best bioavailable form, super low
[48:29.320 --> 48:35.480]  price 1995. Nobody's got this to speak 50 bucks. Okay. Totally organic. Most of synthetic. You
[48:35.480 --> 48:39.400]  need to get the supermail vitality. You need to get the vitamin mineral fusion 20 percent off.
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.120]  You need to get supermail vitality. You need to get lung cleanse. You need to get the bone and
[48:44.120 --> 48:49.080]  joint formulas. You need to go and get strategic relocation. You need to buy the videos. You need
[48:49.080 --> 48:52.200]  to support us. You need to send the links out. You need to spread the word. You need to go to
[48:52.200 --> 48:59.400]  stone zone. You need to go to stone cold truth. Got a new website. You need to understand this is a total war.
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.840]  Stone cold truth.com. This is a total commitment that you want to be an American. You want to
[49:04.840 --> 49:08.760]  fight the new world order. You want somebody to march on Washington. We're marching with Donald
[49:08.760 --> 49:14.040]  Trump. We marched in Cleveland. We marched in Philadelphia. We're battling in the streets.
[49:14.040 --> 49:18.360]  Communist spitting and hitting us and saying we should die. We are and I'm not bitching. I want
[49:18.360 --> 49:23.240]  to fight. I love it. The point is that we're committed. We're doing everything we can peacefully.
[49:23.240 --> 49:27.000]  We're going through hell and I love it because this is the animating contest for liberty. But
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.880]  I'm just saying we need you to realize you are the guts and the heart and the blood of this
[49:31.880 --> 49:37.720]  operation and the brains and the eyes and the soul and the will. And so I want Mark coffers
[49:37.720 --> 49:41.800]  against these enemies because I can tell I mean it's a lot of it's a lot of crap going on. I mean
[49:41.800 --> 49:49.080]  they are really serious. We're fighting hardcore mafias that brag about 500,000 kids dying under
[49:49.080 --> 49:53.640]  the Clintons and Iraq being a good price to pay. These are demons that no one's ever called. We're
[49:53.640 --> 49:58.440]  calling them. We know who they are. We've built the platforms to fight them. We are fighting them.
[49:58.440 --> 50:04.840]  We need you to support us. Get Stone's books at m4warstore.com. Get them on his website. Spread
[50:04.840 --> 50:10.520]  them. But you understand this is war bonds. This is 21st century war and we are soldiers on the
[50:10.520 --> 50:17.160]  front lines. Roger. Yeah, we need we need hardcore volunteers. If you can't help us in the exit polls,
[50:17.160 --> 50:24.200]  if you can't be a poll watcher, send us $25. Send us $50 help fund the operation because when this
[50:24.200 --> 50:30.360]  election is yours, aren't cheap people. It's not enough to say we were robbed with no evidence.
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.960]  But if there is admissible evidence that this election was stolen, then there will be widespread
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.400]  civil disobedience in the these bastards. No, we're not going down and props not going out.
[50:41.400 --> 50:46.600]  Stay there, Roger. This is epic. Roger Stone's our guest one final segment with him. Then we've got
[50:46.600 --> 50:51.160]  a lot of other guests joining us in analysis. But if you just tuned in, I'll recap the huge news.
[50:51.720 --> 50:55.640]  Homeland security, basically under civil emergence, he's going to take over the election.
[50:55.640 --> 51:01.640]  Obama said they're not involved though. Whoa. All orders going to affect immediately.
[51:01.640 --> 51:07.000]  Curfews began at 6pm and will be strongly enforced. Long breakers will be dealt with swiftly and

[52:04.040 --> 52:09.800]  contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[52:09.800 --> 52:14.440]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants. They know water treatment plants
[52:14.440 --> 52:19.000]  are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out. Protect your family's water supply

[54:14.520 --> 54:26.520]  World government thing established. Donald Trump at 2.30 today is going to be meeting with the Mexican President Central and flying up to Arizona. The guy is a war machine against tyranny, the stamina that is just totally presidential.
[54:26.520 --> 54:55.480]  They look at this guy that doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, exercises, fuels himself on red meat. A pure Americana and they just are pulling their hair out. Roger Stone is our guest. I cannot stress enough now is the time to spread the word. The world is listening. How obvious is it with Obama saying there's no such thing as election fraud. The feds aren't involved. And then the feds announced basically a civil emergency over critical infrastructure to protect the election and are coming in to take it over.
[54:55.480 --> 55:20.440]  Because they're worried about hackers when they're the ones, the federal government and others that have been caught stealing elections. We've had die-bold chief engineers testify to Congress on this. So just what Roger Stone, so astute, listen to him. He said a month ago on this show, repeatedly, watch the watchers, watch homeland security, watch J. Johnson or Red Elinge, watch if they send a bunch of people in. That's who'll steal it.
[55:20.440 --> 55:37.400]  And now they, oh, they want to protect it all of a sudden. And that shows they're making this risky move because they know Trump is pulling ahead. Five minutes left. Thank you for your time, Roger Stone. Other points you'd like to add.
[55:37.400 --> 56:04.360]  Yeah, I think we're at a crucial juncture here in which they're trying to set the narrative in advance so that they can get away with stealing this election. Look, you have a number of events that are going to royal this race. I am absolutely convinced that Julian Assange and the folks at WikiLeaks have the equivalent of political dynamite that they intend to drop on the Clintons between now and the election.
[56:04.360 --> 56:20.360]  So now suddenly David Brock, media matters for America, correct the record, which should be distort the record. Now suddenly we're questioning the credibility of Assange. He's a conspiracy theorist. He's a nut, even though no one...
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.360]  Even though these are admitted documents that prove Hillary is commanding the media.
[56:24.360 --> 56:35.360]  Right. So where the documents came from is really immaterial. It's what the documents say because none of these leaks have ever been questioned in terms of their authenticity.
[56:35.360 --> 56:40.360]  Well, even real liberals like Greenwald are coming out and saying Hillary's a complete monster because she is.
[56:40.360 --> 56:48.360]  These emails are the equivalent of the Watergate tapes. They're indelible. They're out there and they're going to come back.
[56:48.360 --> 56:50.360]  They're worse. They're worse. They're more powerful.
[56:50.360 --> 56:57.360]  They're more powerful. What do they do then when these come out? Start a new war? I mean, how are they going to try to distract from all this, Roger?
[56:57.360 --> 57:04.360]  Well, first of all, they're friends in the mainstream media will attempt to minimize it. You can already see the drumbeat now questioning...
[57:04.360 --> 57:05.360]  It's Russians. It's Russians.
[57:05.360 --> 57:16.360]  Right. It's Assange. He's releasing the truth to help the Russians. I want to know what the truth is. I mean, Putin's not a dumb man. He understands that Hillary's word is no good.
[57:16.360 --> 57:20.360]  He knows that Hillary is a liar. He knows that no negotiation he has...
[57:20.360 --> 57:23.360]  Hillary loves failed states and is evil.
[57:23.360 --> 57:30.360]  And he knows that Trump is for a period of daytime. Trump wants peace. Trump is the peace candidate.
[57:30.360 --> 57:36.360]  And that's horrible. So they say he wants nuclear war. He wants peace, so he wants nuclear war. She wants war, so she's good.
[57:36.360 --> 57:44.360]  And he, frankly, would like to have a period of hard-headed negotiations after which we could coordinate our activities with the Russians.
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.360]  Exactly. And he knows China is the one screwing us over, not the Russians.
[57:49.360 --> 58:02.360]  Well, like Nixon, he's prepared to play them off against each other in the best interests of the United States as opposed to the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, which is bending over for them.
[58:02.360 --> 58:16.360]  Getting back to Trump and his view on Russia, I mean, you're saying, obviously, from just your research, obviously, not from talking to him, that he would like to work with Russia. That would be great. Imagine a world, the globalist, for 100 years, the Robber Barons have always tried to stop us from linking up with Russia.
[58:16.360 --> 58:19.360]  Doesn't that make perfect sense?
[58:19.360 --> 58:29.360]  Well, look, economic opportunity is what got them out of the gulag, and capitalism works. That's why they have to use it to reform their system.
[58:29.360 --> 58:32.360]  Putin is a nationalist. Trump is a nationalist.
[58:32.360 --> 58:37.360]  Hold on. 70 seconds. I know you have another interview, but do five more, and we'll let you go. Roger Stone's our guest. I'm Alex Jones.
[58:37.360 --> 58:41.360]  The feds are announcing. Well, Obama's announcing he's taking control of the election.
[58:41.360 --> 58:49.360]  He's taking control of the election. Obama. The same people that no billed Hillary. This is unbelievable. I just, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[58:49.360 --> 58:59.360]  Brainforce. It's completely different. Try a bottle of it. Rob Doe joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brainforce did.
[58:59.360 --> 59:07.360]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[59:07.360 --> 59:16.360]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brainforce right there. I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind of clears up.
[59:16.360 --> 59:29.360]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[59:29.360 --> 59:39.360]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brainforce. I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brainforce and came in.
[59:39.360 --> 59:49.360]  You will find Brainforce and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:21.360]  Another time. In the age of wonder. It's incredible. Another world. Another time.
[1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:26.360]  They thought nobody would look at their own dossiers. They thought nobody would resist them.
[1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:39.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:48.360]  For a corporate eugenics-based world government to ever take control that has to do so by stealth, their own Banff Canada 2007 documents, say by stealth we must keep this secret.
[1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:56.360]  With world leaders meeting, with corporate leaders. You can't put that genie back in the bottle.
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:09.360]  And if you're receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. I've said for decades here. I know they're ridiculing me and attacking me, but I know when their plans start going into place, my credibility will explode.
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:20.360]  But that isn't what matters. The time bombs were already planted politically. A lot of them. And so you can't even kill the messengers at this point.
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:27.360]  Going back to Roger Stone, how do they set up the world government, the UN takeover of the internet next month?
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:37.360]  George Sorrell saying only his groups will be able to be on the web. All this megalomania of these narcissists and borderline personality disorders and sociopaths and psychopaths.
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:46.360]  I mean, look, there were a lot smarter crazies like Hitler and Napoleon that got their butts kicked. I really smell defeat and almost death on these people.
[1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:55.360]  I just hope they don't take us all with them. But what about enclosing any other final points, Roger Stone, of StoneColdTruth.com?
[1:01:55.360 --> 1:01:58.360]  I just think history is against them is what I'm saying.
[1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:09.360]  Well, this explains the uptick in the bully boy tactics. I mean, three people who work for me have now been hacked. These same three people tell me that they believe they're under around the clock surveillance.
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:17.360]  A dark car with smoked windows outside their homes. These are just IT people. The death threats have tipped up sharply.
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:25.360]  I got a nice email this morning. He said, the Clintons have killed many people who get in their way. You are next. Very nice, very heartwarming.
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:30.360]  Yeah, they don't see the black cars around anymore because a few times, you know, things happen.
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:34.360]  Well, you live in an open carry state. I do not.
[1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:38.360]  Somebody pulls on the black car. I mean, I go over and start talking to them. But yeah, go ahead.
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:47.360]  The greatest single mistake of those who are running the country and indeed the world was when they allowed the legalization and the widespread of the Internet.
[1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:56.360]  We have found each other. We are together. We're in touch. Now when they talk about regulating the Internet, that means shutting it down.
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:03:01.360]  That means censoring. His own email says he wants to shut us down. Stoned. Too late. Too late.
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:07.360]  We know how to find each other and we're ready to march. The toothpaste cannot be put back in the tube.
[1:03:07.360 --> 1:03:13.360]  So what do they do? Hopefully they just, hopefully they back off and are smart, but they're not going to. What do we do when they try to steal the election?
[1:03:13.360 --> 1:03:18.360]  We shoot a whole show on this. If they steal the election, Alex, I predict to you they will not be able to hold on to it.
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:24.360]  I agree. They're going to, they, not we, they are going to cause a constitutional crisis.
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:31.360]  And by the way, you were the number two in command taking it away. I mean, who knows who really won from, from Gore? I mean, you're somebody that does this.
[1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:37.360]  Well, in that case, we don't really know who won that election. It's actually impossible to decipher.
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:44.360]  And therefore a war of tactics and superior strategy awarded that election to George W. Bush.
[1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:46.360]  And that's why they're so scared of you.
[1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:49.360]  Well, the fact that he then led us into the Iraq war is one of the greatest.
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:53.360]  No, I know you hate him and you've gone public ever since then. I mean, you're from, you're from marijuana legalization.
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  You're more of a libertarian. I mean, you're a good guy.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:04:01.360]  I'm still asking my God for forgiveness for what I've done for the Bushes. I was blind, but the scales.
[1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:06.360]  And look at how they're in bed with the Clintons. So you're really battling the Bushes now. You're, you're trying to get your soul back.
[1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:13.360]  Right. Cause it's the same criminal combine. This is the Bush Clinton crime family. Read my books.
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:18.360]  No, I agree with you. And you don't say that. I'm talking about Roger Stone. I love him. I really, I mean, this is a great guy.
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:24.360]  Because he is so accurate. He doesn't tell you what you want to hear. He really tells you what he really thinks is going on.
[1:04:24.360 --> 1:04:30.360]  And nine times out of, you know, I mean, I'd say nine, nine times out of 100, he's dead on. I agree with you.
[1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:34.360]  They're not going to, if they steal this, it's their undoing. They will not be able to keep it in their hands.
[1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:40.360]  Agreed. Alex, we'll see you next week. Absolutely. Or anytime you want to pop in, Roger Stone, anytime.
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:47.360]  StoneColdTruth.com, get us books at m4store.com and get the Bill Clinton rape shirt he designed at m4store.com as well.
[1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:53.360]  Thank you so much, Roger. Great to be here. If you're going to punch the Clintons in the nose politically, why not go all the way?
[1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:59.360]  And we've done that here. We are all in 100% commitment.
[1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:05.360]  Italian authorities are so concerned with their youth joining the ranks of ISIS, they've decided to pay them not to.
[1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:11.360]  According to The Washington Post, half a million young Italians are about to receive free money to stay away from terrorism.
[1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:18.360]  Europe is in a free fall, struggling to counter the threat of ISIS and other groups that are aggressively recruiting in Western Europe.
[1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:25.360]  But Italy says they're keeping their kids away from terrorism by giving more than half a million 18-year-olds a voucher for $500.
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:31.360]  The voucher will allow the recipients to visit museums, go to concerts, even see movies at reduced prices.
[1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:34.360]  It sends a clear message, the program director said. He goes on to say,
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:39.360]  A welcome for those who reach the age of 18 and a reminder of how crucial culture is.
[1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:43.360]  They imagine terror. We answer with culture. They destroy statues. We love art.
[1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:51.360]  The cultural battle that he explains does not include curbing the mass influx of refugees into Italy from the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:58.360]  Those refugees who carry those dangerous ideologies he's trying to combat, I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowars.com.

[1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:30.360]  And why did I have a liner cut where I say I'm leading a frontal assault? Because I plan to make a big spectacle, no matter what happens to me.
[1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:48.360]  I want people to see the enemy drawn out. I'm a gambit. I've chosen to play myself as a pawn if need be, even though I may be destroyed, to take the king in the end.
[1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:57.360]  Basic strategy, the enemy doesn't even play it because they're so arrogant and they're used to attacking on a sleek zombie population.
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:06.360]  But large portions of the population are not in a zombified trance. And that's who I am trying to communicate with.
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:19.360]  To mobilize them. To believe we can resist the new world order. And to know that we can take action.
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:27.360]  And that's what we're doing right now. History is taking place.
[1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:36.360]  Shop it down.
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:44.360]  The human spirit is being reignited. What an unbelievable interview yesterday with Nigel Farage.
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:50.360]  One blind spot we have here at M4 Wars is we'll have huge breaking news on our own show and then I make a big deal out of it because we're so humble.
[1:09:50.360 --> 1:10:03.360]  And that's why I've been telling the listeners and viewers that M4 Wars is so successful at changing the global narrative and exposing the new world order, the corporate tyranny, the crony capitalist system.
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:09.360]  I don't get up here and say, hey, by the way, we're the tip of the spear, you're the tip of the spear, just as hyperbole. I say it because it's true.
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:18.360]  And I'm always in the last few years been too humble to say it, but we need to say it to understand the nature of the war we're in.
[1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:21.360]  So I want to salute you. I want to commend you. I want to thank you.
[1:10:21.360 --> 1:10:32.360]  We've been playing with this voice changer piece of equipment so that members of the media or whistleblowers can call in and speak without their voice being recognizable.
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.360]  Is that hooked up and ready yet, guys? Good it is.
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:54.360]  I want to open the phones up because one of the biggest groups we get contacted by is people in mainstream media. And I mean inside Rolling Stone, inside MSNBC, inside CNN, inside Fox News, inside everything.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:11:02.360]  A lot of times they get mad because I can't call them back or whatever. And a lot of times they're reporters, they're researchers, they're journalists, they're writers.
[1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:10.360]  And they get pissed like, this is really important. Alex can't call me. Sometimes they're prominent people. And I'm just like, man, there's stacks of this coming in. Just give us the information.
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:18.360]  And we will not say who you are. In fact, we delete the stuff out of the email once we get it or the things like that. And we have all sorts of procedures.
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:25.360]  Not that we're perfect. Nobody is. And we're under major attacks. God knows what's going to happen. Just pray for us.
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:32.360]  But in fact, will you guys bring me our local number? I don't have a copy of it in the studio. Thanks.
[1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:36.360]  I want to open the phones up so members of the media.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:45.360]  I forget about the idea for this last week, but it's a great idea. Can call in and actually talk about what you witnessed, talk about what you've seen, talk about what you've been told to do.
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:56.360]  Because when you see every newspaper in the country every day doing nothing but attacking Trump and they don't even put in another op-ed saying something nice about Trump.
[1:11:56.360 --> 1:12:04.360]  When the coverage is a hundred to one. And I mean that when I say it. I mean, it's a hundred to one against Trump. Totally distorted.
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:14.360]  You know you're dealing with the country in deep trouble. And you're dealing with a power structure that is in full panic who has robbed us up one side and down the other.
[1:12:14.360 --> 1:12:27.360]  So here's your chance. You can call right into our phone system and it is absolutely anonymous. You can go on air and you can give us a brief account of what you're witnessing.
[1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:39.360]  Maybe you agree with the system. And you'll obviously be able to call in, but we'll be able to tell when we take the call if you're really a media person because you'll be well spoken, focused and have information.
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:50.360]  We're not obviously vetting and saying all these are a hundred percent real media calls. But the point is, is that if you've got whistleblower information about the media and you want us to expose that.
[1:12:50.360 --> 1:13:06.360]  See they've got all these government quote protections around tyranny now in the name of national security, but there's nothing that says people in the media can't whistleblow even though the media is operating as the propaganda force of these offshore multinationals that have hijacked the country.
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:27.360]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539. And that's 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. If you don't want to voice change yourself and you're with the media, maybe you think they won't notice who you are or whatever, I don't think that's probably a smart move.
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:39.360]  You can call the network number or maybe you can call in on your own system. A lot of folks have voice changers on their phones. You can do that as well. And that number is the standard number 800-259-9231.
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:47.360]  But 877-789-Alex is the number to call in. We'll be taking your calls coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:14:07.360]  If you just joined us, the globalists have made a critical error. They have been operating their ongoing takeover program as if they were still in the 1980s or 70s.
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:23.360]  And I believe that they've had air superiority with the dinosaur collaborator media discrediting or attempting to discredit or spinning true independent media that's exposing their crimes.
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:37.360]  And they met an even bigger error in a string of them when I came out over a month ago and had a special message to Donald Trump dealing with election fraud. I personally talked to him as well, obviously. And he didn't so much do what I told him to do.
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:43.360]  He already concurred and absolutely was on the same page and was already right there with me or even ahead of me.
[1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:53.360]  But I encouraged him to basically ignore some of the people telling him not to go with that and to go all the way because if they stole it from Sanders and they try to steal it from him nakedly in the primaries,
[1:14:53.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  and they've got a history of it that Homeland Security was going to go in and probably bring in UN observers to make sure he legals and people could vote and change the debate away from election fraud to retail voter fraud,
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:15.360]  which is individuals cheating rather than the computers being hacked. And I said, you got to do it while you're still way ahead in the polls.
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:26.360]  It's going to start stealing the polls, obviously, and saying you're behind. That's standard tactic. You need to go now with this information so that when you're actually still ahead, you talk about the fraud.
[1:15:26.360 --> 1:15:38.360]  You'll be ahead all the way through. But they're going to put out the fake polls that you're way behind to actually create that perception. And obviously, Trump was right there.
[1:15:38.360 --> 1:15:46.360]  And Trump did it. That's why they're so scared of it. I mean, they are having to put on adult diapers over the sky. Okay.
[1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:52.360]  And obviously, Trump has his own experts that were telling him the same thing. He's really smart. He understands how things operate.
[1:15:52.360 --> 1:16:01.360]  They already tried to steal it from him. He stood up and contested it. So he got it. Sanders didn't. So he lost it.
[1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:10.360]  And then Trump comes out two days after I talked to him. And after I put the message out, I talked to him that day.
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:16.360]  And then I came in. I called Rob Jacobson up. He was on that weekend. I said, we're shooting a video of a message to Trump.
[1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:26.360]  Surely a message to the people. I've already delivered the message to Trump that day. But we're going to put this video out, explaining this to people and showing the fraud that's already happened and the fact,
[1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:31.360]  you know, the history of fraud and the fact that Trump has to build an army to fight election fraud, which he's now doing.
[1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:38.360]  And that's why they are in a conniption fit to send in their federal army to say, no, we're the feds in the UN. We say we didn't steal it.
[1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:51.360]  Don't listen to the KKK slash Russian Trump people. You talk about conspiracy theory. That is ridiculous. Russia can barely operate its country and feed its people under economic sanctions.
[1:16:51.360 --> 1:17:00.360]  The idea that Russia is pulling my, let me tell you what's pulling my strings, my conscience and my commitment to this nation.
[1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:07.360]  We've already been conquered by globalist multinationals. We're not being conquered by the Russians.
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:12.360]  The same globalist that have conquered us are trying to reconquer Russia right now.
[1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:17.360]  Just like the Germans, the Nazis attacked the United States and the Russians, same deal.
[1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:23.360]  But this time it's not Uncle Joe Stalin who was evil. So you kind of go, what do I do? It's not, it's not, they're not.
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:32.360]  This is so incredible, ladies and gentlemen, think about this. Russia kicked all these oligarchs out that had been managing the communists for 80 something years.
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:37.360]  Putin starts arresting them. They're always Rockefeller and Rothschild fronts. The Rothschild sue over it.
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:44.360]  It comes out in court. The British high court goes, this actually proves everything they said about you. You're horrible.
[1:17:44.360 --> 1:18:01.360]  Imagine a judge standing up to Lord Rothschild. You can go read the articles and saying this case actually proved not just that your case of slander and libel fails against these newspapers, but this really shows what you did to Russia.
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:08.360]  The exact same people are gang raping this country right now.
[1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:18.360]  So of course Russia is sitting there watching it. The globalists occupy the US, use all our force against them while they're screwing us over.
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:23.360]  The Russians are just bleeding out, flopping around on the ground. The New World Order is just running.
[1:18:23.360 --> 1:18:26.360]  All these desperate jihadis, all over the planet, slaughtering people.
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:31.360]  These stabilizing us. They're breaking our families down. They're bankrupting us. They've imploded our borders.
[1:18:31.360 --> 1:18:43.360]  We are falling just like 1917 and Russia people. They're going to come after everybody. You understand how screwed we are? This is not a game. This is not a radio show.
[1:18:43.360 --> 1:18:53.360]  The reason all the former brass expelled by Obama listen to this show because it's the only place they can tune in and hear something that resembles the truth.
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:59.360]  Not because they're learning anything from me. They already know it.
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:12.360]  Even current generals tell me and others, and my father when he was in a meeting with some of them, that this show is basically 100% accurate on what's going on.
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:26.360]  It's not hard to be 100% accurate. The very same Robber Baron families that took over Russia and were financed in 1917 are literally gang raping us right now.
[1:19:26.360 --> 1:19:35.360]  And Trump knows all this. Trump gets it. He's going, we got these globalist New World Order people. We got the Chinese. We're cleaning you out.
[1:19:35.360 --> 1:19:43.360]  And they know what Trump said. He's going to arrest Hillary. Oh, yeah. You know what? It's on, folks. You know why Trump's so confident?
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:51.360]  He knows what's going to happen that they try to pull some big coup thing, counter coup against this. I'm telling you, folks, we're sitting on top a mountain of TNT right now.
[1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:59.360]  And nobody's blinking. We're going in, through, and beyond.
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:10.360]  Today, I became a biophoton woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas five-seat oil in my morning one-world-way drink and was still happy and energized at 3pm.
[1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:15.360]  Normally, I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today I felt energy and very clear.
[1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:22.360]  My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She said my eyes look bright and I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon.
[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:29.360]  I told her there was a magical oil that enabled my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant. She said, I want some.
[1:20:29.360 --> 1:20:36.360]  A second one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful, abundant energy.
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:45.360]  I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt. The combination of one-world-way and five-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life.
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:50.360]  The kind that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus. And I'm 64.

[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:14.360]  I got no friends because they read the papers. They won't be seen with me. I'm feeling real shot down. I'm feeling mean.
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:20.360]  Yeah, maybe back in the 70s when he wrote that song, the papers attacked you. People didn't want to be seen with you.
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:30.360]  Now when the papers attack, you know, people want to be seen with you because America and the world is waking up to globalist occupation.
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:41.360]  And that little genie can't be put back in that little bottle.
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:55.360]  I got no friends because they read the papers. They can't be seen with me. And I'm getting real shot down. I'm feeling mean.
[1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:00.360]  No more with the nice guys.
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  I remember when they would have all these articles, even a local paper saying, Jones is crazy. He claims there's secret army drills happen.
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:11.360]  I had video of the black helicopters and drills. I wasn't against the military. They would also say that.
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:15.360]  I was just like, no, these drills are going on. Stop denying you're doing them.
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:19.360]  And Clinton was doing it, not to train people, but to acclimate the public. The trip's on the streets.
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:26.360]  Clinton was thinking about martial law. It's come out. I've interviewed Thomas Sanchez, the head of emergency management in Kingsville,
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:33.360]  the San Antonio police chief at the time, Ali Philippus and others. When they were approached to ask, would they support Clinton in a martial law takeover?
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:40.360]  And of course, all that did was educate the Delta Force, who they had going around trying to sell everybody on this,
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:47.360]  because who better than these strong, you know, patriot, really smart soldiers to do the corruption?
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:52.360]  There's nothing new under the sun. That's what Julius Caesar would use, would be like famous war heroes to go corrupt people.
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:57.360]  They redid it in the HBO special, Rome, where he hires the war hero, got to go do the corruptions.
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  He goes, you're getting them so cheaply, I need to have you do all my corruptions.
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.360]  But as they thought they were corrupting people, they were only educating everyone.
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:12.360]  So good luck with your plan for gun confiscation. Good luck for your plan with civil war.
[1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:23.360]  I tried to prime a race war, just like they used civil unrest in Ukraine to overthrow it. This is George Soros' quantum garbage.
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:28.360]  Now, let's go to these clips again and be just joining us, because we've had dozens and dozens of callers call in, but no media yet.
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:33.360]  It's media right now, folks. Only media that want to talk about what it's like working in establishment media,
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  or maybe you disagree with me in your establishment media.
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:41.360]  You know, media banners can call in, but they never do anything real. They're also scripted so controlled.
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:47.360]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:52.360]  And folks calling in who aren't media don't want to skip to the other folks that are, so please don't call right now if you're not media.
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:27:01.360]  Now, continuing. Here is Obama a month ago, before Hillary named the name that not be named.
[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:06.360]  Oh, that's out of Texas. Oh, I mean, the feds aren't involved in elections.
[1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:10.360]  Now they're announcing the feds' Homeland Security, Obama.
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:14.360]  Jay Johnson to take over elections is being announced.
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:17.360]  Homeland Eye's special declaration to take charge of elections.
[1:27:17.360 --> 1:27:21.360]  The Department of Homeland Security being considered a declaration of the election as a critical infrastructure.
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:31.360]  And now says they want to do it. And they're already over it bringing in UN and EU, OECD.
[1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:37.360]  Watchers. Let's go ahead and go to Lord Obama.
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:43.360]  Of course, the elections will not be rigged. What does that mean?
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:47.360]  The federal government doesn't run the election process.
[1:27:47.360 --> 1:27:56.360]  States and cities and communities all across the country, they're the ones who set up the voting systems.
[1:27:56.360 --> 1:27:57.360]  Oh, really?
[1:27:57.360 --> 1:28:03.360]  Voting booths. And if Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory.
[1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:05.360]  I thought those didn't matter, they said.
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:06.360]  Bernie Sanders.
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:14.360]  Being propagated across the country, including in places like Texas.
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:22.360]  Where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths.
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:26.360]  Oh yeah? They're so arrogant that they think they're going to win Texas. They're stealing everything.
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:30.360]  Okay, now. Now suddenly Homeland Security is going to run the elections though.
[1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:34.360]  Because people now know it's mainstream media that announces who wins, the fraud's out, people are watching.
[1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.360]  So now they're going to come in for more legitimacy.
[1:28:36.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  It's not AP now, and CNN, it's Jay Johnson. When the wall of the ledgers is at meeting with Clinton on an airplane, she's running her elections.
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:52.360]  So let's go ahead now and go to this other clip. This is Jay Johnson projecting onto Trump everything he is.
[1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:55.360]  The guy that's going to run the elections says you can't have Trump, he's disqualified.
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:28:58.360]  There's no conflict of interest, he shouldn't recuse himself.
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:01.360]  And again, I'm a Chinese jet pilot. Here it is.
[1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:10.360]  As the Secretary of Homeland Security, I have avoided responding to the political season and what candidates have said running for president.
[1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:12.360]  There's no money.
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:27.360]  However, I believe that it's the responsibility of those of us in national security and Homeland Security when a leading candidate for office proposes something that is irresponsible, probably legal, unconstitutional and contrary to international law.
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:29.360]  Un-American.
[1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:35.360]  And we'll actually hurt our efforts at Homeland Security and national security. We have to speak out.
[1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.360]  And he goes on a deep nice Trump. Why don't you then have feds oversee elections?
[1:29:40.360 --> 1:29:44.360]  Well, I've actually met a lot of the feds. They're actually more awake in the public. They're totally freaked out.
[1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:49.360]  I'm not defending all the stuff they do, but I mean, they got to bring foreigners in.
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:29:55.360]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex J. Johnson, the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:59.360]  Oh, my God.
[1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:09.360]  Virginia state officials in Richmond say that there are now 40 confirmed cases of hepatitis A that are connected to strawberries used at tropical smoothie locations across the state.
[1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:15.360]  These berries were imported from Egypt and they contain the Hep A virus, and they say that other states are affected as well.
[1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:23.360]  Officials encourage anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at a restaurant within the last 50 days to watch for symptoms of hepatitis A.
[1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:28.360]  Now, this news comes as President Obama is planning on ramming through the passage of the TPP in coming days.
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:33.360]  The TPP that would irrevocably compromise the safety of our food supply here in the U.S.
[1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:43.360]  and immediately open up the floodgates of seafood, poultry, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports to the country while we currently inspect only 2% of all food imports.
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:51.360]  The TPP would also allow foreign companies to compromise food safety decisions and force U.S. inspectors to make new assessments very quickly.
[1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:56.360]  There are no resources or even a basic agreement in place to make sure that our food supply is safe.
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:31:25.360]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:35.360]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[1:31:35.360 --> 1:31:42.360]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary spike-GRX herbal processing technique.
[1:31:42.360 --> 1:31:49.360]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:59.360]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit InfowarsLife.com.
[1:31:59.360 --> 1:32:06.360]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:12.360]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:21.360]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:29.360]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:37.360]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:46.360]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:53.360]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:58.360]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:08.360]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. Just let me think.
[1:33:08.360 --> 1:33:14.360]  That's right. Thoros is shutters now.
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:28.360]  Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[1:33:28.360 --> 1:33:31.360]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:35.360]  You decided, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in longer.
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:39.360]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and depression.
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:49.360]  Where once you had the freedom to object and don't think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and selecting your submachine.
[1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:53.360]  How did this happen? Who's to blame?
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:58.360]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others. They will be held accountable.
[1:33:58.360 --> 1:34:04.360]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:11.360]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror and disease?
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:18.360]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[1:34:18.360 --> 1:34:24.360]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Suttler.
[1:34:24.360 --> 1:34:35.360]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:46.360]  There is a war. There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[1:34:46.360 --> 1:34:54.360]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[1:34:54.360 --> 1:35:03.360]  In the movie, V for Vendetta, towards the end, when the police inspector is meeting with V in a disguise, he doesn't know it's V till the end.
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:10.360]  He says, why didn't you do something about this before? Why didn't you take action? Why didn't you stop this?
[1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:20.360]  This false flag bioweapon attack. Why did you expose it? He said, I was waiting for you, inspector. I was waiting for you.
[1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:29.360]  Very powerful movie. I really admire the Wachowski brother and sister for their work because it really says it all, doesn't it?
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:38.360]  That movie is so powerful. I'm waiting for you. You're waiting for me.
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  And again, it's the men at the police understand the larger criminal conspiracy of the globalists, which they write books about. They think we're dumb. It's over.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:55.360]  That's why they want to have a war with police. That's why they try to corrupt the police.
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:06.360]  Because then they can come in multinationally and purge the police and be big heroes and have these truth and reconciliation commissions that UN has and then bring in total tyranny.
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:11.360]  And then the police are going to sit back and allow the persecution of patriots just like YouTube.
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:21.360]  If you just joined us, a woman who's a feminist, a pretty big feminist, does a feminist journal, a publication, runs groups.
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  There's a horrible example for women, in my view.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:34.360]  There's an Asian guy with a hula girl tastefully dressed on his dashboard just for fun, you know, happy thing.
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  Not degrading Hawaiians.
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:44.360]  Any more of you had a bobblehead of a cowboy or something. I mean, it's just something fun to be, hey, you're in my cab.
[1:36:44.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  She bullies you for six, seven minutes, cusses at him, tells him she's going to basically ruin his career, put him on Gawker.
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.360]  I can't wait to hurt you. I can't wait to hurt you.
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:37:04.360]  The YouTube Community Guidelines Organization concurred and removed Laura Southerner's YouTube channel.
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:11.360]  She's challenging it because she said this woman's a bully when she's clearly a bully.
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:21.360]  So speaking out against their bullying, and that's the YouTube diversity team, Gil White.
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:24.360]  I bet Gil White's white.
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:33.360]  I'm not bashing white people, but I'm telling you, the worst social justice word is the most commissariate, abusive, getting off on it, race-baiting.
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:41.360]  Controllers are the white college students that George Soros sends that do the chance, deck the halls with dead cops.
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:50.360]  And then when one of the black teenagers actually shoots a cop, they get killed, their life's ruined, the Soros piece of filth just scurries off into the dark.
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:38:00.360]  Those are the people that grand juries need to start inditing, indict the asses of these college students that are calling for murder.
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  They're organizing crime. If I did that, I'd be arrested like that.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:07.360]  By the way, I don't call for it because I want to bring everybody together.
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  But I'll say this, I must have my other shoes in my mouth off about physical stuff.
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:24.360]  But the New World Order obviously knows, I mean, if you think we've begun to fight so far with the hacks and everything and risking our lives and not carrying what you do to us,
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:29.360]  can you imagine if you actually ever take the gloves off for real? I mean, you people are crazy.
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:36.360]  There won't be anywhere in the world you can hide, nowhere, ever.
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:45.360]  You have successfully pissed off more than 10 million veterans who are below the age of 55.
[1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:51.360]  They're almost all becoming experts on who you are and what you do.
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:57.360]  And they aren't people that are bloodthirsty. They just are hoping we can fix things peacefully.
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:11.360]  If we can't, you're going to last as long as a bottle of red wine in a hobo encampment.
[1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:18.360]  And I don't take any pleasure imagining rotting demonic piles of filth dying.
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:23.360]  I just want you out of my life. I want you to go back to the catacombs where you came from.
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:29.360]  I mean, I don't like, my life isn't about some pissing contest to beat the New World Order just because I want to beat you.
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:38.360]  I want you off our back. Understand that? And I'm committed and I've put my will and my spirit, everything I've got against you.
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:42.360]  And you can feel it, can't you? Because here's the little secret.
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:48.360]  Good people have more will and more guts and more spirits than you evil people do any day.
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  And you know that. That's why you've always been trying to brain damage us at birth and make us as stupid as possible while you don't give vaccines to your kids
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.360]  until you hope your little stunted demon kids can beat us in the real world. It's not happening.
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:10.360]  And the fact that we're aware of who you are, you realize that we've got our arm like Beowulf around your arm.
[1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:17.360]  And we're not letting go. So you take us wherever you're taking us. You see, you're going with us.
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  It's like that intro we had earlier. Maybe we should play it again in the next segment.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you. You understand that? Yes, you've taken me down.
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  You've taken my family down. You've hurt me. And I'm going to hurt you right back.
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:39.360]  But here's the thing. I'm hurting you a lot worse than hurting me and you know that, don't you?
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:44.360]  Because I will never back down to you people. And you see, this is just the beginning.
[1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:51.360]  Just like tyrants fall every time you are going to fall.
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:59.360]  And you're going to be an example to everyone else on how to not be a scumbag.
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:03.360]  And I'll be honest with you more and more because the epic energy that's rising right now, I get tears in my eyes.
[1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  It's not even tears of sadness or pain. It's tears of joy. Of joy.
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:17.360]  Because since the foundations of this earth were laid down, this contest was meant to happen.
[1:41:17.360 --> 1:41:25.360]  And this contest has happened over and over again. But we are in a time of the greatest contest this species has ever faced.
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  And we're entering the crucible right now. And I am so humbled to be at the center of the crucible.
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:45.360]  And I'm going to tell you, our listeners and our viewers and our affiliates and the station managers and our sponsors and everyone,
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  you are just as important as Donald Trump or Matt Drudge or myself. That's something Matt Drudge.
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:55.360]  I've learned to tell reporters all the time they're independent for decades. You're just as important as the New York Times.
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:00.360]  You're just as important as the Washington Post. You matter. You're important. I tell my crew that.
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:04.360]  It's not arrogance. We need to realize we're more important. They're sold out, known liars.
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  We want to tell the truth. Damn it. We hate it when we make a mistake. We want to be honest. I want to be good.
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  Because it feels so good to be good and to be closer to God. And Lord knows I take the Lord's name in vain.
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:27.360]  I cuss. I do bad things. It's just who I am. I lust after women. I eat too much. I do it all.
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:31.360]  But you know, at the end of the day, my soul is pointed towards God like a North Star.
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:39.360]  It's not pointed towards wanting to screw people over, wanting to dumb people down, wanting to pray and have big, huge hordes of poor people.
[1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:49.360]  What the hell is that? We don't need to be ruled by that. But we have to wake up to it if we're ever going to change it.
[1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:54.360]  We've got a news reporter, Julio in Illinois. We're going to go to him in a moment. I actually know this reporter.
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:59.360]  He's leaked a lot of stuff to us over the years. Worked in TV, radio, you name it.
[1:42:59.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  And so he's the only reporter that has the courage to call in. We've got hundreds of calls coming in now.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.360]  No reporters are calling. You send this stuff, whatever you're scared to call in. We even have a voice changer.
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:13.360]  No need to change Julio's voice. Julio's been calling him for 10 years since he was a college student.
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.360]  But since I'm in the interest of time, I'm not going to even belabor this.
[1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:22.360]  Buy the Hillary for presidency shirts at cost. Spread the word. Buy available.
[1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:25.360]  Selenium, everybody needs it. It's amazing. Talk about an energy booster.
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:29.360]  Electrochemical goes with the X2, makes an iodine.
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:37.360]  20% off the great vitamin mineral fusion amino acid fruit punch drink we have that's so again, absorbable.
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  Great for your kids to drink. Send them to school with it. You name it.
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:47.360]  We need to fund the operation. That's where everybody knows. I mean, I can just sit there and say, send me donations, whatever.
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:52.360]  The point is we need funds to fund this operation. We're doing it. We're expanding in the face of the enemy.
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  We're all in. I want to thank you for your support. I want to play a few clips here first, though.
[1:43:56.360 --> 1:44:06.360]  We've had Dr. Drew, five plus years on CNN, one of the top rated shows in that crap house that is headline news.
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:12.360]  And he's not even really a conservative from my research, more like a libertarian.
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.360]  He's not really worried about Hillary. She does look bad.
[1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:19.360]  And the two drugs she's on, Cuban and an armored thyroid counterbalance and it'll kill you.
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:22.360]  I mean, what the hell's going on with her doctors? I'd like to talk to Hillary.
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:32.360]  Three days later, you're fired for paying out your contract. Get out of it. Get your stuff and get out.
[1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:37.360]  And all these other doctors. Now, Obama's former doctor.
[1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:43.360]  Infowars.com has it. He'll report it as well. Clinton should have neurological exam.
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:51.360]  The clip we play of two weeks ago with her in Nevada, where she's sitting there and this person just says something.
[1:44:51.360 --> 1:45:03.360]  Keep talking. You're all right.
[1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:08.360]  That isn't a bag lady. I don't mean bag ladies, but I mean, she's gone.
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:15.360]  I don't have a PhD in psychology, but I've talked to folks that do. They go, yeah, she's clearly disassociating.
[1:45:15.360 --> 1:45:21.360]  Psychotic doesn't know what freaking planet she's on and she's got a handler going, you're all right, continue.
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:30.360]  And then she pushes into her act. The woman is under judgment. She's cursed.
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:39.360]  That's a sick part of me. Hope she gets in because it's only on what people up is they're going to put Trump in and blame him for everything and then implode everything already planning it.
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.360]  But they know how slick he is and he'll be able to deal with it. Ah, man.
[1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:48.360]  Justice be done, man. The habits fall. I'm trying to get Trump in, but no one should be bored right now.
[1:45:48.360 --> 1:45:52.360]  We got front row seats.
[1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:56.360]  What could potentially be Armageddon?
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:10.360]  And guess what? Even if you lie to yourself and think you're in the cheap seats, the nosebleeds, every man, woman and child, I don't care where you're from or what color your skin is, your blood's red and your soul is on the line.
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  And you're in the arena. That's the big secret. People think they can set outside things and they're in charge and they can comment. No, everybody's in the arena.
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:32.360]  So now Obama's former doctor says she's a neurological exam. This is on CNN. Here it is.
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:40.360]  Trump has said, Dr. Shiner, he'll release his medical records if and only if Hillary Clinton releases hers.
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.360]  Now, she did release a two-page letter from her doctor with real doctors to New York fake.
[1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:45.360]  Not her doctors to New York fake.
[1:46:45.360 --> 1:46:48.360]  Some of the things you mentioned, cholesterol, things like that. It also talked about
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  Not her year, not her year in December 2012 when she had a concussion and a blood cut in her brain.
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:47:04.360]  And in this, the letter says she had follow-up testing in 2013, which revealed complete resolution of the effects of the concussion as well as total dissolution of the thrombosis.
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:09.360]  Mrs. Clinton also tested negative for all clotting disorders. Is that enough?
[1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:14.360]  No. There are a number of questions I have. First of all, she's also 68 years old.
[1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:21.360]  And I think while I think that medical letter was well written and was very professional, unlike Dr. Bornstein's, it's not enough.
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:26.360]  For example, she is on Coumadin, a medication to prevent blood clots.
[1:47:26.360 --> 1:47:27.360]  Red poison.
[1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:31.360]  And you have to monitor that. And it says that she's being monitored regularly.
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  I'd like to know how well she is being controlled. That's a difficult drug to use.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:45.360]  Also, I think she should have had a neurological examination, a thorough neurological examination in 2016.
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:52.360]  We know what happens to football players who have had concussions, how they begin to lose some of their cognitive ability.
[1:47:52.360 --> 1:47:56.360]  I think both of them should release their records.
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:03.360]  Which is what Dr. Pachynic said, who, by the way, has been friends with Hillary Clinton.
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  The guy's not a Republican. He says she has to go.
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:11.360]  Here's the baseball fox. And it just gets serious with medical records and things.
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:16.360]  Hillary Clinton had a brain tumor removed as the info.
[1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  And they think it's growing back.
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:21.360]  Three years later.
[1:48:21.360 --> 1:48:27.360]  She's not long for this world.
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:29.360]  She wants to talk about my black heart all day?
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  This lady, give me a break.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:33.360]  I'm ready to stand before God right now.
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:37.360]  Not an arrogant way.
[1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:41.360]  But I know I love God.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:43.360]  If I've done bad things and God turns him away, I don't blame God.
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:45.360]  You think God's going to turn me away?
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  You say, I've got a dark heart. Lady, give me a break.
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:52.360]  I might involve the murder of hundreds of thousands of Christians like you.
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.360]  All right. We've got news reporters calling in.
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:56.360]  I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:00.360]  I'm going to go to Mike and PA first, report for daily newspaper and PA.
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:08.360]  Then we're going to go to Julio in Illinois. You're on the air. Go ahead, Mike.
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:10.360]  Alex, how's it going?
[1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:12.360]  Good, brother. Go ahead.
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:14.360]  Great.
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  You know, I go into the office every day and sitting there and just listening to my editors and the other reporters just going off constantly about how much of a war monger Trump is, how insane he is.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  I just kind of sit back and laugh to myself as I listen to them talk, kind of keeping some things to myself, but definitely it reaches points where I just start breaking out laughing when they start talking.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:50:03.360]  I mean, I lately have been bringing up some of the health issues and they just think that I'm making these things up and I print off articles, mainstream articles, pretty much anything I could find and hand it to.
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.360]  I'm like, look, I'm not making this stuff.
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:10.360]  She's had a bunch of brain surgeries. She's falling down. She doesn't know who she is in her own WikiLeaks.
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:19.360]  She wants Parkinson's medication. She's on weird blood thinners and stuff they haven't used in 40 years. Medical doctors are getting fired.
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:24.360]  Talk about it. What do you think is going on with her?
[1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:33.360]  Honestly, I think she is breaking down. I think that she probably does have Parkinson's or something similar to that.
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:53.360]  And she, I think she's realizing and the people around her are realizing that she doesn't have much time and they need to do whatever they can to get her in so that they can get the plan continuing down the road, even if she's not around to be a part of it.
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  That's right. That's what Dr. Bachanik told us today. He's coming on the next few days. The word is they're already preparing cane.
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:04.360]  And again, I have guests on that don't make stuff up. I mean, if they say they've got the intel, they've got it.
[1:51:04.360 --> 1:51:12.360]  And Hillary is not long for this world. I mean, that's, and I'm not threatening her. The media will say, we have this deal where we talk about her campaigns disintegrating.
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:18.360]  It's like her blowing away and they go, oh, the news. He wants to, that's her head being blown off. I don't wish any harm against Hillary.
[1:51:18.360 --> 1:51:23.360]  They want me to say that because then they can green light taking me out. That's kind of how this works.
[1:51:23.360 --> 1:51:29.360]  If I thought it would save the world for Hillary to have something bad happen to her, then I would be honest about it.
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:33.360]  I don't want anything physical to happen to her. She's just a front puppet, but a very nasty one.
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:39.360]  But I do want to see her prosecuted so we can roll up all the foreign assets that are controlling her.
[1:51:39.360 --> 1:51:43.360]  But getting back to your newsroom, that's what I see around leftist is this hype.
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:46.360]  Have you seen the New York Times, Washington Post? They write articles this week.
[1:51:46.360 --> 1:51:53.360]  And last week saying we need to be more unimpartial and more hateful. And so what if we're lying about Trump?
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:52:04.360]  He's bad. I mean, I've never imagined I'd see articles from the New York Times calling for more vitriol and lashing the media for not being more hateful.
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:06.360]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:14.360]  I tell you what, though, the newspaper, the Patriot News, which actually won a Pulitzer a few years ago.
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:16.360]  No, it is. Yes.
[1:52:16.360 --> 1:52:24.360]  Coverage of the Sandusky 10 Live. There's a column that's John Mycic that's on there.
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:33.360]  Every single day he has an anti-Trump column. It's like he's the anti-Trump beat.
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:41.360]  But if you go on the comments section and look at the comments that people are writing, people are not buying it at all.
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:49.360]  I mean, 10 to 1, it's anti. Just saying, you know, this is a total joke.
[1:52:49.360 --> 1:52:55.360]  Oh, I know liberals who are good people who don't like Republicans because of, you know, abortion and wars or whatever.
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:58.360]  And I get, you know, the war stuff. I hate Republican establishment.
[1:52:58.360 --> 1:53:03.360]  But they're like, yeah, I've never opened the New York Times up and every article is like foaming at the mouth.
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:07.360]  The Washington Post, CNN, foaming, foaming.
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  I mean, they have just totally dropped any pretense of objectivity.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:14.360]  And I mean, who knows what's going to happen? Let me ask you this question.
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:23.360]  When you're talking all these reporters and writers around you, are they in a bubble or do they understand that this has become an incredible spectacle?
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:33.360]  Well, here's another thing. The political reporter who sits right across from me the other day, she's like, do you know what the alt-right is?
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:46.360]  And I just started laughing. And she started watching the Washington Post video that they made of what their quote-unquote, what the alt-right is.
[1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  And I said, well, look at these people they're talking about. Nigel Farage. He's not extreme. These people are not extreme.
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:04.360]  These are sane people. Talking about how horrible right far it is, you are so...
[1:54:04.360 --> 1:54:17.360]  Every point that she brings up is 100% mainstream leftist talking points that she brings up. And that's what she writes about politically.
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:19.360]  It's amazing.
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:27.360]  Well, that shows how disconnected they are. I mean, when you've got Greenberg and all these other people coming out that are like real liberals,
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  respected guys that expose Bush and now Obama's doing bad and Hillary is they're exposing him.
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:37.360]  These are good liberals. These are the good liberals I grew up around. I mean, I'm a libertarian. I'm not a right-winger guy.
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:43.360]  The issue is, they're so committed to hating Republicans, they'll do anything for the Democrats.
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:47.360]  I wonder if they're ever going to wake up from their trance. I mean, what does she say when you pull her down?
[1:54:47.360 --> 1:54:55.360]  This is WikiLeaks. This was the hero of the left just six, seven, eight years ago. Why do you now hate him?
[1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:05.360]  Well, you know, and I look back, I was pretty involved with the anti-war movement going to protests and just looking at these people.
[1:55:05.360 --> 1:55:11.360]  And some of these sane people I see were in newsrooms being part of the protests.
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:17.360]  I'm like, where are these people now? Where have they gone? Do you not realize?
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:23.360]  Look at the list of the people who are supporting Hillary. This is something that I brought up the other day.
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:33.360]  Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Duckheim, Michael Chertoff, the right wing of all right wing.
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:39.360]  The ultimate, the ultimate war mongers, the ultimate war pigs.
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:48.360]  Yeah. And their comeback is, well, Dick Cheney supports Trump. So that's their only comeback. Oh, Dick Cheney supports it.
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:54.360]  Well, all I know is this. Trump is an unknown quantity to a certain extent. I'm not going to claim, I know he's perfect.
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:56:03.360]  But we know what we've got here with Hillary. And the fact that people claim their anti-establishment, this is the time then to stand up against the establishment.
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:09.360]  Great points, Mike. Thank you so much. And you can tell that's a real reporter, smart guy who's sitting here and you're talking to him.
[1:56:09.360 --> 1:56:14.360]  You can tell probably a classical liberal, you know, a real nice guy that's smart and wants everybody to have freedom.
[1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:23.360]  And he's just looking at all these fascist reporters acting completely insane and throwing total objectivity out the window and distorting what Trump says.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:26.360]  He's just like, man, this is crazy. This is crazy.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:34.360]  Julio, who I know is a radio host and also a newspaper reporter, he's called in for years. Julio, what is your take on all this?
[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:39.360]  Why do you think the Homeland Security is, quote, taking over the election?
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:42.360]  Well, just look at the polls, Alex, and I hope you're doing well.
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  Look at the polls of corporate media and how much the people distrust corporate media here in the state.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:57.360]  It's not a surprise to me to see Homeland Security doing this. Being in Chicago, it's the third largest market in the country behind Los Angeles and New York City.
[1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:06.360]  And a lot of these reporters I've had experience as an intern and then moving back to Chicago recently and working as a radio news reporter for a statewide news agency.
[1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:13.360]  A lot of these reporters in Chicago on the TV side are quite comfortable, high salaries.
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:22.360]  They're worried about pushing the envelope and getting canned by the most stations in Chicago are owned and operated by the big networks.
[1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:29.360]  And Dr. Dre was a message. It doesn't matter how your ratings are. You even say you want to help Hillary. You're fired.
[1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:36.360]  Yeah, it's unbelievable to see the bias. I've covered the Republican debate in Vegas back in December.
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:38.360]  I've covered the Illinois presidential prize.
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:41.360]  You were a big detractor of Bush. I protested Bush with you.
[1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:50.360]  It's amazing to see and to talk and verse with some of these reporters or even hearing them. Mostly I'm silent when I cover some of these events.
[1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:55.360]  Because I like a sponge. I want to absorb everything I hear from sources.
[1:57:55.360 --> 1:58:05.360]  It's amazing to hear the bias from some of these reporters, how they're working with their editors, working with their news directors, working with other reporters
[1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:12.360]  or opposing news organizations to do what they can to support their particular candidate.
[1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:15.360]  In this instance, in the presidential primary, it's Hillary Clinton.
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:24.360]  I was about to say, I've never seen such coordination between media to lie. They get together with the unified BS of the day. It's crazy.
[1:58:24.360 --> 1:58:35.360]  Another reason that is Alex is because a lot of these stations, despite them, is here in Chicago in high-rise buildings. Beautiful, beautiful buildings.
[1:58:35.360 --> 1:58:39.360]  Stay there. Come back in 70 seconds, Julio. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:52.360]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:15.360]  One in three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:25.360]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:23.360]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:43.360]  But the globalists that are on their last leg decide to push this thing. All it takes is a few good men and women that will push it all the way. All the way and never stop. All the way. You can't lose.
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:01:05.360]  Yeah, they call us walking corpses. Unholy living dead. They'd like to lock us up. Pull us in the pretty pins. I don't want to be in your dungeon. I don't want to be in your globalist hell.
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  There's no mystery. Why I'm in misery.
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:27.360]  Let's go to Julio in Illinois news reporter for statewide news agency. We'll stop right there. Finish your points Julio. Very informative. Go ahead.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:41.360]  So a lot of the stations in Chicago and throughout the big markets across the country are so dependent on newswire services. I worked at a small radio station in Wyoming and smaller markets. That's all they can get is newswires.
[2:01:41.360 --> 2:02:00.360]  They're repeaters. They're repeaters. They're repeaters, Alex. And so when you have agency French press, or you have Reuters, or you have, you know, Associated Press, or you have even these big markets, Fox, NBC, et cetera, et cetera, turning out the same types of garbage, the same types of bias reports.
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:11.360]  They get picked up all over the country just based off of the budget constraints by so many of these news organizations, big market, media market, small market.
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:23.360]  And then Drudge comes along or Info Wars comes along and listeners send us videos, their own articles. That just creates an alternative and more and more radio stations, TV stations are actually tuning into that alternative view.
[2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  That's what they say. Oh, don't go to Drudge or Info Wars. That's discredited, but that doesn't work anymore. So Julio in 30 seconds, how do they counter that? They shut the web down.
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  Well, of course, they shut the web down. They station by up more and more stations, fire the departments, and then keep turning and burning the same type of garbage.
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:53.360]  I had an interview with the largest news wiring service in the country recently. And during the interview I talked about, I, you know, we just started shooting the breeze about the election.
[2:02:53.360 --> 2:03:01.360]  I asked, what do you think about this nationalist trend? We see it in France with Marie Le Pen. We see it in Britain and the UK with Najafaj.
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:07.360]  We're seeing, we're seeing sort of a new dichotomy in politics and it's happening right here in the States.
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:16.360]  It sort of happened a little bit with the Tea Party, but it's now flourishing with Donald Trump and this guy from the largest news wiring service in the country told me to my face.
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:25.360]  Yeah, but here in the States, it's more of the racist far right. And, you know, we think that, you know, going in here.
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:30.360]  That's all they've got. Listen, Julio, I have met you several times. I've seen your work. You've leaked this great info.
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:36.360]  I actually, we ought to talk to you about working for Info Wars. Would you want to move down here to Texas?
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:43.360]  Uh, you know, I'm in a position now where I can do more independent stuff with love to contribute in any way possible.
[2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:48.360]  All right, listen, I got your number years ago. We've talked, hung out in DC, you name it, in Chicago.
[2:03:48.360 --> 2:03:53.360]  But send me your info right now. Give me your number. I'm serious. I'm wanting to hire a few more reporters.
[2:03:53.360 --> 2:03:57.360]  I was just thinking, I just clicked, this guy's always done great reports. You're not saying, of course, your full name right now.
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  There's probably fire from your job, but we ought to just hire the real reporters. That's what we're trying to do here.
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:07.360]  Uh, Julio, we'll talk to you very, very soon. Give us your info. I'm going to have Rob do call you.
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:12.360]  And even if you don't move down here, we can have your auxiliary and, you know, pay us somewhat of a salary to be up there in Chicago.
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:19.360]  But Julio's a go-getter. He's a smart guy. We need to, we need that guy. That's why I need you to buy the products, the t-shirts.
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:21.360]  Well, I'm selling those at cost. So I guess not those.
[2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:32.360]  Uh, the vitamin mineral fusion, 20% off the great organic mustard seed based selenium bio true selenium exclusively at infowarslife.com.

[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:44.360]  And you see what we have here is these great reporters and crew and researchers.
[2:04:44.360 --> 2:04:54.360]  Infowarslife.com or call toll-free 888-2533-139. We've got more reporters like JT Cowd, uh, Ruffin, uh, Colorado News.
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:59.360]  We'll be back. Stay with us straight ahead. Dr. Corsi's joining us.
[2:04:59.360 --> 2:05:05.360]  Italian authorities are so concerned with their youth joining the ranks of ISIS, they've decided to pay them not to.
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:11.360]  According to the Washington Post, half a million young Italians are about to receive free money to stay away from terrorism.
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:18.360]  Europe is in a free fall, struggling to counter the threat of ISIS and other groups that are aggressively recruiting in Western Europe.
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:25.360]  But Italy says they're keeping their kids away from terrorism by giving more than half a million 18-year-olds a voucher for $500.
[2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:30.360]  The voucher will allow the recipients to visit museums, go to concerts, even see movies that reduce prices.
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:33.360]  It sends a clear message, the program director said.
[2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:39.360]  He goes on to say, a welcome for those who reach the age of 18 and a reminder of how crucial culture is.
[2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:43.360]  They imagine terror. We answer with culture. They destroy statues. We love art.
[2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:51.360]  The cultural battle that he explains does not include curbing the mass influx of refugees into Italy from the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[2:05:51.360 --> 2:05:55.360]  Those refugees who carry those dangerous ideologies he's trying to combat.
[2:05:55.360 --> 2:05:59.360]  I'm Margaret Hell reporting for info wars dot com.
[2:05:59.360 --> 2:06:03.360]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[2:06:03.360 --> 2:06:09.360]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:14.360]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[2:06:14.360 --> 2:06:22.360]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:30.360]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:33.360]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:37.360]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:43.360]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:46.360]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:50.360]  And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.

[2:06:55.360 --> 2:06:58.360]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[2:06:58.360 --> 2:07:03.360]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[2:07:03.360 --> 2:07:09.360]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:16.360]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:25.360]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:36.360]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimental grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:42.360]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed. No needles, no injections.
[2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  Don't take my word for it. Try it for yourself. Discover the secret. Secret 12.

[2:07:55.360 --> 2:07:59.360]  InfoWarsLife, Secret 12.
[2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:10.360]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:18.360]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:43.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:51.360]  Well, Dr. Jerome Corsi is joining us. He is a, is it two-time or three-time number one New York Times bestseller?
[2:08:51.360 --> 2:09:01.360]  And he has the new book out, Always Definitive, Partners in Crime. If there's somebody writing the reality-based narrative in so many elections, it is Dr. Corsi.
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:07.360]  They fear this man as much as they probably fear somebody like Matt Drudge, and that's hard company to keep.
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:13.360]  I don't think there's probably anybody on that fraternity, but Jerome R. Corsi, PhD, really an expert on the economy.
[2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:20.360]  I want to ask him, just selfishly, separately about the Germans clearing the store shelves. Government says get ready for civil emergency.
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:25.360]  That was last Friday, got almost no coverage. That was a government announcement.
[2:09:25.360 --> 2:09:32.360]  What's happening with all these sorrows emails coming out? Worse than I even thought about the UN taking over the internet.
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  Now it happens next month. I mean, it's like my worst concerns have now been, like, magnified and are happening.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:48.360]  I'm wondering from Dr. Corsi what he sees coming up next, but Dr. Corsi is an expert on the economy, so we'll also get his take on that.
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:52.360]  If that going over his bio, he's a PhD from Harvard in political science.
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:57.360]  He is currently a senior staff reporter at WorldNet Daily where he works as an investigative reporter, WND.com.
[2:09:57.360 --> 2:10:02.360]  He's an expert on political violence and terrorism and works as a consultant on a lot of clandestine areas.
[2:10:02.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  In 81, he received a top secret clearance for the agency for international development where he assisted in providing anti-terrorism training to embassy personnel.
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:18.360]  25 years beginning in 81, he developed working and banks throughout the United States and around the world to develop financial services marketing companies
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:26.360]  to assist banks in establishing broker dealers and insurance subsidiaries to provide financial planning products, so he revolutionized that whole area.
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:30.360]  And services, including working for Trump, I would add as a consultant, to their retail customers.
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:34.360]  He is a noted financial services speaker. That's really where he's the most prestigious.
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:39.360]  Not just as a writer, but obviously the average listener doesn't know that because they're not into, you know, banking.
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  And he's published many, many books, many of them, New York Times bestsellers, WND.com, Twitter.com, etc.
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  Wow, where to begin? Obviously the economy, his book, so many fronts, but the clips.
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:57.360]  I've already played them twice, so I won't play them again or maybe later.
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.360]  Obama says a month ago, what's election fraud? The feds don't run elections.
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:09.360]  Well, we know they've been caught, the party in power before directing voter news services in the media, the way the announcements are supposed to go.
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:18.360]  But now Homeland Security and J. Johnson are announcing special executive action to defend the infrastructure and come in and quote, protect it.
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:24.360]  And as Roger Stone said a month ago, watch if Homeland Security comes in to protect the machines. That's the fix.
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  It's like prophecy. It's happening. So this is simply over the top. And then I have Reuters from last week, where the Organization of Economic Cooperative Development,
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:40.360]  that's really at the heart of globalism from the Marshall plan.
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:53.360]  It's OSCE, this multinational NATO Interpol group, is going to oversee with 10 times the people they had last time, 500 monitors are elections.
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:58.360]  So Obama's gone from the feds aren't involved to bringing foreigners in.
[2:11:58.360 --> 2:12:09.360]  I mean, this is so sensational with George Soros' emails saying have the UN run a local police that it's like I'm a dog in a butcher shop.
[2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:17.360]  It proves everything. It's surreal though. Dr. Corsi, I've thrown a big gestalt out there. Where do we begin? I mean, this is crazy.
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:27.360]  Well, I think you're exposing the heart of the corruption that we're facing here, Alex. I mean, to begin with, you know, you don't have an unbiased source when you've got
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:33.360]  Department of Homeland Security coming in with J. Johnson to supervise the elections.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:47.360]  I mean, it's like saying the IRS is an unbiased source when it won't give out any 501c3s to conservative groups or that the Department of Justice is unbiased when it won't prosecute Hillary Clinton,
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:57.360]  even though it's clear that Hillary Clinton is extremely careless with her classified emails as Secretary of State.
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:09.360]  This bias of the corrupt Obama administration and the corrupt Clinton administration, I think, is going to be frightening, but Alex, you've got the globalists scared to death of Donald Trump,
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:21.360]  and they're running as fast as they can to get to the finish line to put in global government and to eliminate fundamental freedoms Americans experience under the Constitution as fast as they can.
[2:13:21.360 --> 2:13:29.360]  Let me ask you this. Obviously, you've got a lot of really high-level contacts. When they have no fewer than 20-plus articles last month in The Economist,
[2:13:29.360 --> 2:13:37.360]  The Financial Times of London, The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, all the globalist organs saying globalism with Brexit is in deep trouble.
[2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:47.360]  If one more domino falls, if Hillary doesn't win, we're done. Red-level panic, do anything, get her in. I mean, it seems like they're in a panic.
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.360]  Is that a put-on or why are they acting suddenly so scared?
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:59.360]  Well, I think Alex, globalists are scared. I think, finally, people are waking up. I mean, you've done a tremendous job of getting the message out.
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:03.360]  Well, don't get me. You've done the job really documenting it for decades.
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:17.360]  We've all been fighting this battle to get the people of the United States and around the world to realize that one world government is enslavement. It's enslavement by the transnational corporate structure
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:25.360]  and their power brokers in both the Democratic and Republican Party to force the United States into a European Union.
[2:14:25.360 --> 2:14:32.360]  You're also going to see tremendous articles and pressure about Obama panicking that he's not going to be able to get this trans-pacific...
[2:14:32.360 --> 2:14:35.360]  What they're saying, they admit TPP's in deep trouble.
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  Deep trouble. And, you know, what the Brexit, I think, shows is that despite the elites, despite the Ryan, Paul Ryan and McConnell's, you know, with the charade of the Republican Party as a conservative party, which, at its core, it is not,
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:15:08.360]  they're worried to death that they're going to lose control over the populations which dare to vote against the Brexit. And we're seeing the same thing now, the drumroll, you know, the Trump is going to lose, give up, don't vote.
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.360]  It's all over. Hillary's already won.
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  Tokyo rose stuff.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:24.360]  Yeah, exactly. Precisely. All propaganda, all aimed at discouraging those of us who know that the populism that's building around the world is a pushback against the enslavement.
[2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:32.360]  So let me ask you this, then, as one of the architects of defeating this over 40 years, and as you told us, you know, no, Trump's for real. I've been talking to him for 40 years.
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:39.360]  He knows everything we know and more. He's obviously anti-new order. It's why they're crapping their pants. Americanism, not globalism will be our credo.
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:43.360]  I see them losing either way. If they steal it, they lose.
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:53.360]  Authoritarianism won't prop this up in what's left of our open society. Their whole program relies on self as their own documents from BAM Canada that you put out and others put out.
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:16:01.360]  So what do they do? I mean, I don't want to be overconfident here, but it does seem that the tide has really shifted. The tables have turned.
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:11.360]  Well, I mean, I expect, I expect, you know, a massive, violent kind of effort before this is over. I mean, there's going to be either a war, there'll be an assassination attempt.
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:24.360]  There'll be some, you know, thing to frighten the American people into thinking the only way we can survive as a nation is if we let the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice and the IRS rule the nation.
[2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:35.360]  And they will rule it, not for justice. They're going to rule it for the Clinton elite, for the Obama elite, for the elite and the GOP as well.
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:44.360]  Believe me, these GOP and the Democratic Party, I'm not two parties. They are two wings of the same party. And that's what Donald Trump is.
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:51.360]  Donald Trump is the real deal. I've known Donald Trump. I've talked to him. He truly does believe in America.
[2:16:51.360 --> 2:16:56.360]  I've been on the phone with you before when you had to get off like 10 years ago and Donald Trump was calling up.
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:16:58.360]  You had to go, Donald Trump's calling up.
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:10.360]  I remember that too. Yeah, that's right. You know, Donald Trump is a, he's a really sincere guy. If you get to know Donald Trump, it's part of what gets him into trouble with the media.
[2:17:10.360 --> 2:17:18.360]  That's where he gets all this energy. He's in the epic battle. He knows it. He's told me, he said, use the energy. He goes, it's so good. I mean, he just loves it.
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:26.360]  Well, in fact, he dares to say what is on his mind to say whether it's politically correct or not. And look at the moves he's taking.
[2:17:26.360 --> 2:17:36.360]  He's going to go to Mexico. He's daring to now start calling out Hillary and Bill Clinton on the foundation. And I wrote this book because I think the foundation is the...
[2:17:36.360 --> 2:17:43.360]  Let's talk about the book because you've been writing it over the last year. Now it's here. It's all coming out. The Chinese president pay to play.
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:53.360]  I mean, this is incredible. If they don't, if somebody doesn't indict her, it seems like the sky's the limit because other people are going to be involved in espionage and say, hey, you did nothing to Hillary.
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:18:03.360]  Well, and I wrote the book to point out that the crime here is not just pay to play, but it's enormity. Enormity is using a foundation for personal gain.
[2:18:03.360 --> 2:18:14.360]  And anyone who's contributed a dollar to the foundation can go to a state attorney general and at that state attorney general file a criminal complaint against the Clinton administration.
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:17.360]  And doesn't Trump have standing because he got bullied in the giving money too?
[2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:25.360]  Trump has standing to go to the New York Attorney General. Good luck getting the New York Attorney General to pay any attention. That's the problem.
[2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:29.360]  Again, you've got Democratic Party politics wiring the situation.
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:33.360]  And if an attorney general in Texas starts doing the right thing, they indict him.
[2:18:33.360 --> 2:18:46.360]  Precisely. Or any state, any one state can close down the Clinton Foundation internationally because it can demand until their criminal investigation is finished that the foundation not functioned into fraud anybody else.
[2:18:46.360 --> 2:18:56.360]  And that's a key point that my book, Partners in Crime, showing now that Clintons have used the White House to enrich themselves, which they have.
[2:18:56.360 --> 2:19:00.360]  It's been their only job and they have $100 million each network.
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:06.360]  It can be shut down by ordinary citizens demanding their state attorney generals investigate.
[2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:11.360]  And so people should do it now. And no one loses who does it because it draws attention to it.
[2:19:11.360 --> 2:19:15.360]  What do you make then? We're about to go to break and come back and answer this. We can start answering it.
[2:19:15.360 --> 2:19:21.360]  What do you make by the fact that they have all these other secret bank accounts in the foundation and they don't report out of Canada?
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:24.360]  I'm sure it's well more than $200 million.
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:31.360]  And also pass through accounts with Secret Shell Corporations, WJC.
[2:19:31.360 --> 2:19:40.360]  That's what you're an expert on is banking. So when we come back with Dr. Jerome Corsi, we're going to talk about, look, if they brought in six, seven billion at the foundation and 69 billion in their global initiative.
[2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:43.360]  And we're not talking about $200 million.
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:46.360]  These people that stole George Washington's China.
[2:19:46.360 --> 2:19:49.360]  I mean, these are the white trash of the white trash.
[2:19:49.360 --> 2:19:58.360]  They are the Creme Dollar Creme. They were brought into power by people that wore white, pointy, cheat head outfits.
[2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:20.360]  These people are jokes.
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:34.360]  All orders going to effect immediately. Curfews begin at 6 p.m. and will be strongly enforced.
[2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  Lawbreakers will be dealt with swiftly and justly.
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:04.360]  Dr. Watter Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[2:21:04.360 --> 2:21:07.360]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[2:21:07.360 --> 2:21:10.360]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:17.360]  Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:25.360]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[2:21:25.360 --> 2:21:30.360]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body.
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:36.360]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:39.360]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:45.360]  Now add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:50.360]  and you have a winning combination to confer health and energy like never before.
[2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:58.360]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit sacredseedoils.com. That's sacredseedoils.com.
[2:21:58.360 --> 2:22:01.360]  Honey, I'm really worried about our retirement funds.
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:07.360]  Oh, me too. We lost so much value in the recession and the stock market. I'm worried we won't have enough to retire.
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:11.360]  Jim next door told me that he had set up a new kind of IRA with a gold silver group.
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:17.360]  He said how simple and safe it was. It's a private storage IRA and we could have real gold and silver in our hands.
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:20.360]  Really? You mean we can actually see it and touch it?
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:25.360]  Absolutely. Jim said we could have all the benefits of an IRA to help build our retirement income.
[2:22:25.360 --> 2:22:31.360]  Bottom line, we would own a real tangible asset and we would have the security of knowing we're protected no matter what the economy does.
[2:22:31.360 --> 2:22:32.360]  What do you think?
[2:22:32.360 --> 2:22:37.360]  I think we need to find out how to get our own private storage IRA. We need to call the gold silver group right now.
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:45.360]  Are you ready to protect your future? Call 800-421-3432 now to find out how easy and safe it is to set up a private storage IRA
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:50.360]  with gold silver group and find out how you can qualify for up to $700 in free silver.
[2:22:50.360 --> 2:22:54.360]  All transactions are privately delivered and fully insured. Please call us now.
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:59.360]  800-421-3432.
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:03.360]  This is Dan Pillon. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:08.360]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[2:23:08.360 --> 2:23:12.360]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:16.360]  Call 800-34 No Tax to finally get free of IRS debt.
[2:23:16.360 --> 2:23:20.360]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:43.360]  Call 800-34 No Tax. That's 800-34 No Tax or my website, danpillon.com.
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:57.360]  Free to Medicare patients. Go to nomask.com. That's N-O-M-A-S-K.com.
[2:24:20.360 --> 2:24:24.360]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up here in a moment.
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:28.360]  I'm having trouble describing how crazy all this has got.
[2:24:28.360 --> 2:24:38.360]  I mean, again, the new WikiLeaks, the new DCLeaks, Hillary selling access to the Chinese president.
[2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:43.360]  I didn't even think of that. She is selling access to the Chinese president.
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:51.360]  I didn't even think of that. She is so amoral. She's just selling to anybody. It's all massive felonies.
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:56.360]  And Dr. Jerome Corsi is an expert not just on the banking, but on the federal laws.
[2:24:56.360 --> 2:25:01.360]  His new book, Partners in Crime, is now on sale at Amazon. You name it.
[2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  Get it at bookstores. Very important. This book goes to the very, very top.
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:07.360]  We're going to talk about the book more in the next segment.
[2:25:07.360 --> 2:25:14.360]  But continuing, Dr. Corsi, and folks can also follow you there on Twitter.
[2:25:14.360 --> 2:25:21.360]  We've got that up on screen for TV viewers. You were interrupted by the break getting into the types of crimes they're committing.
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:24.360]  All these banking laws. I mean, I've talked to lawyers.
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:30.360]  If I set up some legal foreign shell corporation and try to put a little bit of money in there to avoid taxes,
[2:25:30.360 --> 2:25:32.360]  they'll probably come after me even though I'm following the law.
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:37.360]  It looks like the Clintons are just engaged in whatever they want. It's wild.
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:42.360]  You're exactly right, Alex. And what they've done, the Clintons have also set up these shell corporations.
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:51.360]  They've got WJC, which is a good Clintons initials. WJC LLC and WJC investments.
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:57.360]  And both of these two companies function to just pass money through.
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:26:05.360]  You couldn't even tell where the money came from or where it's going, because these bank accounts are what money launderers and drug cartels.
[2:26:05.360 --> 2:26:09.360]  The Clintons are using the same vehicles for the Clinton Foundation.
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:11.360]  They're using classic money laundering strategies.
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  Yes, classic. In fact, these would be immediately suspect under any banking laws.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  Is it just the red flag of red flags?
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:25.360]  Yes, it absolutely is. You don't have a former president operating a shell corporation to pass through account.
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:28.360]  That's what money launderers do, what terrorists do.
[2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:32.360]  And then they've got money coming in through local corporations.
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:34.360]  They have a Clinton Foundation in Canada.
[2:26:34.360 --> 2:26:37.360]  They've got a Clinton Foundation in Ireland.
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  And often these are not even registered.
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  The Clinton Foundation only got a determination letter initially to build the library.
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  The Clinton Foundation decided that it was going to raise money for AIDS.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:54.360]  It decided it was going to go into all these other structures.
[2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:58.360]  I can't see how the Clinton Global Initiative is a charity at all.
[2:26:58.360 --> 2:27:02.360]  The money contributed to it, the philanthropy, gifts, and awards.
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:03.360]  These are very rare.
[2:27:03.360 --> 2:27:07.360]  So here's the bottom line. It's one of the biggest criminal operations ever in our face.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:09.360]  A, why do they think they can get away with it?
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:12.360]  B, where does this go?
[2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:21.360]  I first got on this with Charles Ortel, who is a good friend of one of the top financial analysts in New York on Wall Street.
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:29.360]  And Charles said to me, you've got to look at the financial, the auditors financial statements filed with the Clinton Foundation because they're absolutely fraudulent.
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  So they list gross sums, the amount of money that came into the, they don't say where it came from.
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  They don't account for the speeches.
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  We have no idea where the speech money was paid for.
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:44.360]  If you or I did this, we would be indicted within what, six months?
[2:27:44.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  Oh, sooner.
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  I mean, this is so patently obvious.
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:59.360]  Money disappears. The money that the United Nations in Geneva says they give to the Clintons for AIDS is different every year than the amount of money the Clintons report.
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:02.360]  I mean, the financials don't even reconcile.
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:03.360]  Why are they so arrogant?
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:06.360]  What does it show about their brains that they would do?
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:09.360]  These are the kind of financials that are criminal files.
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:14.360]  These are the financials that you use to hide money, just like a pass-through account.
[2:28:14.360 --> 2:28:22.360]  It's a giveaway that you're trying. That's how I caught, I did the initial reporting on HSBC, that it was money laundering.
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.360]  Again, as I said, your real rock star status isn't even politics people know you for.
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:29.360]  It's you're an expert in banking. You were the first guy to go over HSBC.
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  And by the way, Comey from the FBI worked as a board, on the board of directors for HSBC.
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:37.360]  People are all tied together.
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:41.360]  Lorena Lynch gave HSBC, the attorney general, once she was in New York.
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:43.360]  So they're clearly using it.
[2:28:43.360 --> 2:28:47.360]  Yeah, they're clearly using the techniques. These are money laundering.
[2:28:47.360 --> 2:28:49.360]  That's the whole point of partners in crime.
[2:28:49.360 --> 2:28:54.360]  You've got to look at this as a criminal enterprise, money laundering drug.
[2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:56.360]  I understand you're documenting it's a fraud.
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:29:00.360]  We know that you've done a great job of writing the book, but we're going to break it.
[2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:01.360]  We'll come back and give you the floor.
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:04.360]  But the psychology, Dr. Corsi, why do they think they can get away with it?
[2:29:04.360 --> 2:29:06.360]  Is it because they think they're invincible?
[2:29:06.360 --> 2:29:11.360]  They think they're smarter than everybody else and that they have the political power to push everyone off.
[2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:15.360]  And they'll never be investigated. They'll never be prosecuted.
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:17.360]  Criminals always think they'll never get caught, but they're smarter.
[2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:20.360]  So it's the criminology. It's the arrogance of a criminal.
[2:29:20.360 --> 2:29:25.360]  Absolutely. And they get away with it, which is what we've got to put an end to.
[2:29:25.360 --> 2:29:29.360]  Absolutely. I don't want this woman having the nuclear buttons when she's so damn arrogant.
[2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:32.360]  I mean, these people, folks, if you study criminology, of course you went right to the heart of it.
[2:29:32.360 --> 2:29:37.360]  I've only read, you know, seven or eight books on it, but it's like criminals love to get wilder and wilder.
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:41.360]  And they love to do all this stuff, try to get caught. We don't need this woman running the country.
[2:29:41.360 --> 2:29:44.360]  We're going to come back, go through the book. I've got a lot of key questions.
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:47.360]  Your phone calls, get it. Partners in crime, available everywhere.
[2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:49.360]  By Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[2:29:49.360 --> 2:30:09.360]  They're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:09.360 --> 2:30:19.360]  These berries were imported from Egypt and they contain the Hep A virus and they say that other states are affected as well.
[2:30:19.360 --> 2:30:23.360]  Officials encourage anyone who consumed a smoothie with frozen strawberries at a restaurant within the last 50 days to watch for symptoms of hepatitis A.
[2:30:23.360 --> 2:30:28.360]  Now this news comes as President Obama is planning on ramming through the passage of the TPP in coming days.
[2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:33.360]  The TPP that would irrevocably compromise the safety of our food supply here in the U.S.
[2:30:33.360 --> 2:30:39.360]  and immediately open up the floodgates of seafood, poultry, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports to the country
[2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:43.360]  while we currently inspect only 2% of all food imports.
[2:30:43.360 --> 2:30:51.360]  The TPP would also allow foreign companies to compromise food safety decisions and force U.S. inspectors to make new assessments very quickly.
[2:30:51.360 --> 2:30:56.360]  There are no resources or even a basic agreement in place to make sure that our food supply is safe.
[2:30:56.360 --> 2:30:59.360]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[2:30:59.360 --> 2:31:06.360]  More than two years ago, Infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:11.360]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ
[2:31:11.360 --> 2:31:19.360]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[2:31:19.360 --> 2:31:22.360]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[2:31:22.360 --> 2:31:29.360]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:36.360]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[2:31:36.360 --> 2:31:42.360]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:44.360]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:50.360]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[2:33:17.360 --> 2:33:27.360]  Well, it's the time of the season when the blood runs high.
[2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:31.360]  Thought it was a room course. He's our guest. He'll be a jam-packed fourth hour, obviously,
[2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:33.360]  with a day of nights a day.
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:36.360]  I've got a lot of news I want to cover without a course. He answered phone calls.
[2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:38.360]  I want to take, obviously, with your questions for him.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:42.360]  He's got the new book out, Partners in Crime, where you go right back to him in a moment,
[2:33:42.360 --> 2:33:47.360]  but I mean, I run a business that deals with credit cards and companies,
[2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:55.360]  and, man, we've had all sorts of stuff going over the years with the feds and investigations and banks and proving stuff.
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:58.360]  Like, if we have some big sale of a new film, there's a bunch of money in the account.
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:03.360]  I got to go in and do all this stuff, and people actually come out and look at the DVDs and know it's real.
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:08.360]  And then, meanwhile, I watch the Clintons with billions of dollars just do whatever they want.
[2:34:08.360 --> 2:34:11.360]  I'm very offended. I mean, talk about discrimination.
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:17.360]  These people do whatever they want, whenever they want. It's crazy.
[2:34:17.360 --> 2:34:19.360]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:21.360]  I've got a whole list of questions I want to go over without a course.
[2:34:21.360 --> 2:34:26.360]  Before I go any further, you can see that info wars along with WorldNet Daily and Drudge
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:29.360]  and other great patriots are telling the truth.
[2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:34.360]  I mean, these Soros emails coming out are word for word what we've said.
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:36.360]  Quite frankly, they say this stuff in public, too.
[2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:39.360]  It's almost like, oh, it's a leak, so it's even more special.
[2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:43.360]  People actually pay attention to the leaks instead of Soros' own statements.
[2:34:43.360 --> 2:34:47.360]  It's very frustrating, but I'm glad that these emails that people are actually looking at them,
[2:34:47.360 --> 2:34:50.360]  because they basically just repeat what this monster has said.
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:55.360]  We need your support more than ever. We need you to send out the videos, the articles.
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:57.360]  That's how we're having this big effect.
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:00.360]  We're in a total war. You're in a total war.
[2:35:00.360 --> 2:35:03.360]  And we've got the new bio-truth selenium that's from the mustard seed.
[2:35:03.360 --> 2:35:05.360]  It's organically extracted.
[2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:10.360]  It's in a cold process, so it doesn't lose. It's bioavailable.
[2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:14.360]  It's bioavailability. We believe from the research and Dr. Grimps research,
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:16.360]  this is the very best selenium out there.
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:20.360]  It's involved in all your major electrochemical processes in the body.
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:24.360]  It goes incredibly well with iodine and vitamin C, obviously, synergistically.
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:26.360]  If you don't have selenium, you die.
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:33.360]  And there's all the big studies go look at them about what selenium does to lifespan and fertility and everything.
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:35.360]  If you don't have selenium, don't touch a missing link.
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:37.360]  It's available at infowarslife.com.
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:40.360]  It's our first run. It's selling out very, very quickly.
[2:35:40.360 --> 2:35:42.360]  And your purchases make the broadcast possible.
[2:35:42.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  We also have Hillary for Prison shirts that I normally sell for a $19.95 that are best sellers.
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:50.360]  We've sold $100,000 of them.
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:54.360]  And then Hillary came out and said, I have this dark heart. I'm evil. I'm bad.
[2:35:54.360 --> 2:35:58.360]  I said, that's it. It's dark heart special, $9.95 including shipping.
[2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:01.360]  Shipping's $5. The t-shirt costs us like $5.
[2:36:01.360 --> 2:36:04.360]  That cost Hillary for Prison delivered to your door.
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:06.360]  Give them to friends. Give them to family.
[2:36:06.360 --> 2:36:09.360]  This creates solidarity. It creates a meme.
[2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:11.360]  They hate this.
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:14.360]  Now, I like to say it supports the broadcast, but it doesn't because it's at cost.
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:19.360]  But when you buy Super Mel Vitality or the Lung Cleanse or our Vitamemeral Fusion,
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.360]  Fruit Pudge Multivitamin that's so organic, so great for your family.
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:25.360]  It funds our operation. Thank you for your support.
[2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:31.360]  InfowarsLives.com is the nutraceuticals for the supplements. InfowarsStore.com is the umbrella site that has
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:35.360]  everything from water filtration to documentaries and t-shirts, you name it, books.
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:40.360]  And of course, you can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:44.360]  Okay, Dr. Jerome, of course, he's our guest. I want to go to calls in about 10 minutes.
[2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:46.360]  I've got a few questions I want to ask.
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.360]  But sir, you've been polite, pausing for me to customarily interrupt.
[2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:54.360]  I get so excited like a little dog jumping up and down on the trail here.
[2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  But other key points, Dr. Corsi, that people should be made aware of
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:00.360]  and that your book basically breaks down.
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:07.360]  Well, I point out how the, not only is the accounting fraudulent, which it tremendously is,
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:12.360]  there's no detail. You can't figure out where the money came in.
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:15.360]  The speeches are not accounted for.
[2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:19.360]  But also the idea that the Clinton Foundation is doing good works needs to be attacked
[2:37:19.360 --> 2:37:25.360]  because I point out that in some of these programs, fewer than 10% of the money
[2:37:25.360 --> 2:37:28.360]  goes to the charity for which it was given.
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.360]  So that's another scandal. I saw the headline 97%, even mainstream media admitted last week.
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:37.360]  You're saying it's worse. The money, she puts it out of one pocket into the other.
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:39.360]  So that's a whole other scandal.
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:44.360]  Right, and it afforded, meanwhile, the Clintons are flying around in private airplanes there,
[2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:48.360]  living in five-star hotels paid for by the foundation.
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:50.360]  But you've got as a complete scam.
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:56.360]  I point out, you know, the drugs that were delivered, the HIV drugs delivered to Africa,
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:02.360]  were fraudulent. They were purchased from a company in India that made discount drugs
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:04.360]  and they were defective.
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:05.360]  Unbelievable.
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:10.360]  The delivery system, there's an office in the warehouse district in South Boston
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:12.360]  that runs the Clinton Health Initiative.
[2:38:12.360 --> 2:38:16.360]  I went to that office. There's no sign on the outside of the building.
[2:38:16.360 --> 2:38:18.360]  You've got to find out how many people work there.
[2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:22.360]  None of the financial reports detail what those people do, who they are, how many...
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:26.360]  So let's be clear, they're giving one, two, three percent of the money to charity
[2:38:26.360 --> 2:38:28.360]  and even when they do that, it's BS.
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:34.360]  Right, and to find out who worked in this office that runs the biggest program,
[2:38:34.360 --> 2:38:39.360]  the Clinton Health Initiative, the largest program, this little office in South Boston,
[2:38:39.360 --> 2:38:43.360]  I had the interview of the guy who delivers soda to the office.
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.360]  There's no one who would talk to me. There's the only sign on the door.
[2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:48.360]  There's some 20 people up there working or whatever.
[2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:51.360]  They didn't know what they did. You know how much soda they drank.
[2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:54.360]  That's the problem. There's no reporting.
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:58.360]  The money in Haiti that was stolen by the Clintons.
[2:38:58.360 --> 2:39:04.360]  Federal reports, I cite some of these investigative reports after the Haiti disaster,
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:08.360]  who are the pennies on the dollar went to the Haiti people.
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:13.360]  The money was stolen by the Clintons. It was stolen by Beltway organizations
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:17.360]  with ties to the Clintons. It's been a big scam.
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:24.360]  This is why people need to file criminal complaints with their state attorneys general.
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:32.360]  As I point out, in Partners in Crime, you've got money being solicited by these Clinton criminals
[2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:35.360]  to say, we're going to stop earthquake victims.
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.360]  We're going to help in Haiti, earthquake victims in India, AIDS in Africa.
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:42.360]  No, that's all just playing on misery.
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:46.360]  That's all using your sympathy to steal your money from you
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:51.360]  in a classic money laundering scheme where it's shell game.
[2:39:51.360 --> 2:39:55.360]  So I go back to square one and the book breaks it down, Partners in Crime.
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:59.360]  This is like a thousand, a million times what Nixon did.
[2:39:59.360 --> 2:40:01.360]  Why are they so emboldened?
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:06.360]  All these emails of Soros saying, have the UN take over the Internet, shut down conservatives,
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:09.360]  arrest everybody, have the UN run our police.
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:13.360]  I mean, this is worse than I ever thought it was. These people are nuts.
[2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:16.360]  Alex, I just published, I went into the Soros documents
[2:40:16.360 --> 2:40:22.360]  and so I found that Soros funded a group, an African American advocacy group
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.360]  called Color a Change and they ran a campaign against the advertisers
[2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:33.360]  that succeeded in getting Glenn Beck off Fox and then getting Papu Cannon off MSNBC.
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:37.360]  And the Clinton, I mean, the Soros documents brag about this.
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:41.360]  Alex, if your show had been on a cable network,
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:45.360]  Soros would have launched a campaign against your advertiser.
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:46.360]  That's why we sell fund, absolutely.
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:48.360]  We even have them go after our suppliers.
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:52.360]  That's, I tell you what's scary about this is, they've got so much humance.
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:57.360]  I know you've dealt with intelligent stuff that they like to know all sorts of stuff
[2:40:57.360 --> 2:40:59.360]  and even go after suppliers that aren't even listed.
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:02.360]  I mean, they are literally up my, you know what?
[2:41:02.360 --> 2:41:07.360]  And they will continue to be with the IRS, with the banking officials.
[2:41:07.360 --> 2:41:10.360]  All the investigations you get are not by accident.
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:11.360]  Oh, I know.
[2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:14.360]  What the Soros documents prove is they brag about this
[2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:17.360]  in their internal board meetings and when they're funding spending.
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:22.360]  Well, let's talk about Fox. I mean, I was told by Fox executives that I met with the Waldorf story in Cleveland
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:23.360]  and already knew this.
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:24.360]  They said, no, you're absolutely right.
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:27.360]  There's a coup made up Roger L stuff.
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:29.360]  Okay, hug the girl, whatever.
[2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:32.360]  The point is this was the takeover in case they sell the election.
[2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:34.360]  They don't want Fox there to call it the other way.
[2:41:34.360 --> 2:41:38.360]  Fox isn't perfect, but they're taking it down, folks, because it's better than singing in, obviously.
[2:41:38.360 --> 2:41:45.360]  And it's just a bellwether of where we are that media matters three years ago and Politico said run by the White House.
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:48.360]  We're going to infiltrate Fox and take it down.
[2:41:48.360 --> 2:41:49.360]  They did it.
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:51.360]  I mean, that is so outrageous.
[2:41:51.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  Dr. Corsi.
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:58.360]  Well, they're, again, going against your advertisers, getting the regulators to look at your taxes, to look at your bank accounts.
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:07.360]  I mean, what partners in crime is all about is that the clients have figured out a way to run a foundation where they steal the money.
[2:42:07.360 --> 2:42:09.360]  And they know that they control the IRS.
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:11.360]  They know they control the banking organizations.
[2:42:11.360 --> 2:42:13.360]  They control the Department of Justice.
[2:42:13.360 --> 2:42:24.360]  So they'll never be investigated while they, you know, this is the global elite stealing the resources it needs to perpetuate their privilege in their.
[2:42:24.360 --> 2:42:25.360]  I agree.
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:32.360]  So in a football game with every major globalist foundation and every publication saying we're in red level emergency, our plan for all garments falling apart.
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:37.360]  I think it was like what Wall Street Journal today and Washington Post were just saying, we're dead.
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:40.360]  You know, American driven globalism is over.
[2:42:40.360 --> 2:42:44.360]  Well, it's not American driven, it's globalist hijacking us, using us.
[2:42:44.360 --> 2:42:47.360]  Are they playing possum or are they really in this much trouble?
[2:42:47.360 --> 2:42:51.360]  Well, what they're worried about is people are catching on.
[2:42:51.360 --> 2:42:54.360]  The American public is realizing that the economy has been stagnant.
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.360]  The middle class is losing their homes.
[2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:58.360]  They're losing their jobs.
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:03.360]  We've got 94 million people in America that are considered useless by the left.
[2:43:03.360 --> 2:43:06.360]  The African Americans have been abused for decades.
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:10.360]  Let's be clear, the left makes people dependent and then talks crap about them all day out.
[2:43:10.360 --> 2:43:11.360]  They're worthless.
[2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:12.360]  Yeah, because they're worthless.
[2:43:12.360 --> 2:43:16.360]  They have, you know, all that Hillary Clinton wants is African American votes.
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:18.360]  All she wants is Latino votes.
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:22.360]  Now, Obama has done nothing for the African Americans in this country.
[2:43:22.360 --> 2:43:25.360]  You know, the crime rates, the rates of.
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:27.360]  The climate doubled.
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:30.360]  You know, look at Detroit.
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:33.360]  We do want every major city in the United States to be Detroit.
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:36.360]  And you have the United States as a whole move towards Detroit.
[2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:38.360]  Then put Hillary Clinton in office.
[2:43:38.360 --> 2:43:41.360]  So let me ask you this, Dr. Corsi, the new book, Partners in Crime.
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:43.360]  How do they strike back?
[2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:47.360]  Obviously, what do you expect for the next 69 days today till the election?
[2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:48.360]  November 8th.
[2:43:48.360 --> 2:43:50.360]  What do you expect to happen?
[2:43:50.360 --> 2:43:51.360]  What do you think about the polls?
[2:43:51.360 --> 2:43:54.360]  Obviously, internal polling shows Trump ahead in most polls.
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:56.360]  Even the LA Times have been sees a point ahead.
[2:43:56.360 --> 2:44:00.360]  They do these fake polls where they do 15% more Democrats than Republicans and Reuters
[2:44:00.360 --> 2:44:03.360]  say, oh, my gosh, he's got 12 point lead as a three point deficit.
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:07.360]  I mean, looking into your tea leaves in like a two or three minute synopsis,
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:12.360]  as a general of these wars, General Kenobi, what do you expect them to do next?
[2:44:12.360 --> 2:44:14.360]  Well, there's going to be some unexpected wars.
[2:44:14.360 --> 2:44:16.360]  There's going to be another terrorist attack.
[2:44:16.360 --> 2:44:19.360]  There's going to be possibly even an assassination attempt.
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:22.360]  So they're going to October surprise false flags.
[2:44:22.360 --> 2:44:25.360]  False flags and manipulating the new.
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:28.360]  Could they activate their jihadi forces they brought in?
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:29.360]  They could.
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:30.360]  We could have that.
[2:44:30.360 --> 2:44:35.360]  And we could also have more diversions like this Huma Abedin thing with Wiener.
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:37.360]  I mean, who cares?
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:41.360]  But again, it's sympathy for Huma Abedin, stories about sex.
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:44.360]  The Democrats know that they'll survive sexual scandals.
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:46.360]  They think they will.
[2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:51.360]  I think some of the rape stories that Roger Stone has brought forth in his book are very,
[2:44:51.360 --> 2:44:53.360]  very damning to the Clintons.
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:56.360]  But there's going to be a false flag manipulation of the news.
[2:44:56.360 --> 2:45:03.360]  And I caution the Trump Organization and the Secret Service to be especially vigilant
[2:45:03.360 --> 2:45:04.360]  with both candidates.
[2:45:04.360 --> 2:45:08.360]  We don't need any political violence in the remainder of this campaign.
[2:45:08.360 --> 2:45:12.360]  It would be extremely detrimental to our cause of freedom
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:16.360]  because the Globus would just use it as another attempt to grab power.
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:18.360]  That's what's going to happen.
[2:45:18.360 --> 2:45:20.360]  Also, fear tactics.
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:26.360]  You're going to have the Clinton people trying to put Donald Trump as a madman,
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:28.360]  trying to say he's going to take this away from you.
[2:45:28.360 --> 2:45:30.360]  He's going to take that away from you.
[2:45:30.360 --> 2:45:31.360]  Don't listen to it.
[2:45:31.360 --> 2:45:37.360]  Donald Trump is the last real hope we have to preserve any freedom in this country.
[2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:42.360]  And the possibility of losing the First Amendment, the Second Amendment,
[2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:46.360]  the Fourth Amendment, you go on with Hillary Clinton is real.
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:48.360]  There will be no religious freedom.
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:51.360]  There will be no gun freedom, no Second Amendment.
[2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:52.360]  These are serious.
[2:45:52.360 --> 2:45:55.360]  And by the way, they've always denied they want our guns.
[2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:59.360]  I've seen the Washington Post, Rolling Stone, all of them.
[2:45:59.360 --> 2:46:01.360]  They go, yeah, we're going to ban every gun and take them from you.
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:04.360]  And they'll leave it and add stuff like your kids belong to us, by the way.
[2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:08.360]  There's this sickening arrogance and this wild-eyed authoritarianism
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:11.360]  even to the street-level minions of these people.
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:18.360]  With the Soros is doing the intellectual propaganda disinformation techniques of saying,
[2:46:18.360 --> 2:46:21.360]  no, they're not Muslim terrorists who are unbedded.
[2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:22.360]  They're refugees.
[2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:25.360]  They have to be under the UN law.
[2:46:25.360 --> 2:46:26.360]  This is propaganda.
[2:46:26.360 --> 2:46:29.360]  This is disinformation, constantly done.
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:33.360]  You know, it's the police who black lives matter.
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:34.360]  The police are racist.
[2:46:34.360 --> 2:46:38.360]  Police are doing their jobs by and large throughout America.
[2:46:38.360 --> 2:46:41.360]  The African-American communities depend on the police.
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:45.360]  And the cops pulling back is what's caused a thousand-plus black people to be shot.
[2:46:45.360 --> 2:46:46.360]  Look at Chicago.
[2:46:46.360 --> 2:46:51.360]  I mean, look, the fact is, statistically, a couple hundred black people get shot by cops a year.
[2:46:51.360 --> 2:46:52.360]  It's totally made up.
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:55.360]  And I'm not even defending police, but you're absolutely right.
[2:46:55.360 --> 2:46:59.360]  It's a total George Soros-funded red herring.
[2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:02.360]  Well, the average cop has a nightmare job.
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:06.360]  They want them to quit their job and put a social justice warrior in that position.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:13.360]  While behind the scenes, the Soros and the Clintons steal billions of dollars from which
[2:47:13.360 --> 2:47:15.360]  they fund this leftist agenda.
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:17.360]  And it's not even a leftist agenda.
[2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:21.360]  They'll abandon the left as soon as they get power in the globalist.
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:23.360]  This is about the fact that you don't.
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:26.360]  Ninety-four million people to the extreme globalists are worthless.
[2:47:26.360 --> 2:47:27.360]  They're not needed.
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:28.360]  Absolutely.
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:29.360]  So let me ask you this because you're one of the top experts.
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:30.360]  I'm not kissing your rear end.
[2:47:30.360 --> 2:47:31.360]  It's true.
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:33.360]  Dr. Jerome Corsi in the new book, Partners in Crime.
[2:47:33.360 --> 2:47:36.360]  You were on the top experts.
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.360]  We really tells it like it is.
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:42.360]  Historically, looking at this situation, what do you think our chances are?
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:44.360]  Because I see a lot of positive things.
[2:47:44.360 --> 2:47:45.360]  I see a lot of negative things.
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:48.360]  And I'm constantly thinking, my God, it's worse than we thought.
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:50.360]  I mean, what can we do?
[2:47:50.360 --> 2:47:51.360]  Where are we?
[2:47:51.360 --> 2:47:52.360]  What's our position right now?
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:53.360]  We have to keep fighting.
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:55.360]  We have to keep bringing the truth out.
[2:47:55.360 --> 2:47:58.360]  We have to tell reporting every day is, you know, we're doing.
[2:47:58.360 --> 2:48:00.360]  Get these stories out there.
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:01.360]  Document them.
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:03.360]  American people are waking up.
[2:48:03.360 --> 2:48:06.360]  Donald Trump, I've known for 40 years.
[2:48:06.360 --> 2:48:09.360]  He always looks like he's losing and then he wins.
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:10.360]  He's a Tomcat.
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:11.360]  He fights.
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:14.360]  But he, you know, and the press hates him.
[2:48:14.360 --> 2:48:16.360]  They're constantly against him.
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:17.360]  He's constantly threatening.
[2:48:17.360 --> 2:48:18.360]  Because he is a loner.
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:21.360]  I mean, he's done the whole thing his own way before in business.
[2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:23.360]  And done tremendous things for New York.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:27.360]  I mean, look at the, going back to the Commodore Hotel, which is now the Grand Hotel.
[2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:29.360]  You know, the Javits Center built on land.
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:30.360]  He got it.
[2:48:30.360 --> 2:48:33.360]  He loves to take old crappy things and make them beautiful.
[2:48:33.360 --> 2:48:35.360]  He's done tremendous things for New York.
[2:48:35.360 --> 2:48:36.360]  He'll do tremendous things.
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:38.360]  He will go to Detroit and rebuild it.
[2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:39.360]  These people.
[2:48:39.360 --> 2:48:44.360]  And they're afraid because he'll rebuild it in a way that will bring back jobs, will
[2:48:44.360 --> 2:48:45.360]  bring back people.
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:47.360]  Trump cares about people.
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:49.360]  I've seen it in his employees.
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.360]  I've seen it in the people who live in his projects.
[2:48:51.360 --> 2:48:54.360]  I've seen it in people who work for him.
[2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:59.360]  Well, I know a great number of them love Donald Trump because he does care about people.
[2:48:59.360 --> 2:49:03.360]  You're not going to find anybody who really, you know, loves Hillary Clinton except George
[2:49:03.360 --> 2:49:04.360]  Soros.
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:06.360]  Her rallies are going to have 250 people to it.
[2:49:06.360 --> 2:49:12.360]  The only people supporting her are the globalists who want to, you know, contain this elite
[2:49:12.360 --> 2:49:17.360]  power structure over the news, filtering, oh, you can't be told this story.
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:18.360]  No, sure.
[2:49:18.360 --> 2:49:19.360]  Sure.
[2:49:19.360 --> 2:49:22.360]  What about the fact that he was here in Austin and they had 20,000 people in the deal?
[2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:26.360]  Our reporters were there three hours early, had to park two and a half miles away and walk
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:32.360]  in and Texas Monthly said he didn't have big crowds and it wasn't capacity.
[2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:33.360]  You'd think it was.
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:36.360]  I tried even though I had passes to get in.
[2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:41.360]  I couldn't get in and I was invited backstage because it was miles of traffic.
[2:49:41.360 --> 2:49:44.360]  I got there two hours before and then Texas Monthly lie.
[2:49:44.360 --> 2:49:46.360]  I mean, Texas Monthly didn't usually do that.
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:48.360]  Texas Monthly's written fair pieces on me.
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:50.360]  It's like they're all in Dr. Corsi.
[2:49:50.360 --> 2:49:53.360]  They said that the Trump didn't have big crowds in Texas.
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:56.360]  And they're going to demonize everybody.
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:49:58.360]  They're going to do the propaganda.
[2:49:58.360 --> 2:49:59.360]  But that's what I'm saying.
[2:49:59.360 --> 2:50:00.360]  How are they so lockstep?
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:04.360]  How are they getting the media that was always horrible to be 10 times more deceptive?
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:07.360]  The media is in the bag for them.
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:09.360]  Artisan media in the bag for them.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:11.360]  But it was capacity doctor.
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:14.360]  Two and a half mile lines and they said no one was there.
[2:50:14.360 --> 2:50:16.360]  Read political.
[2:50:16.360 --> 2:50:19.360]  Read any of the groups that are really in the bag.
[2:50:19.360 --> 2:50:21.360]  You know, these daily newsletters they send out.
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  They've got the themes.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:24.360]  They've got the structure.
[2:50:24.360 --> 2:50:28.360]  They're communicating as they did in all these newsnet e-mail.
[2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:30.360]  Oh yeah, we had media call in.
[2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:31.360]  That's what they said.
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:32.360]  They said they all coordinate what they showed.
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:33.360]  So you come out.
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:35.360]  Okay, Hillary Clinton.
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:37.360]  Obvious health problems.
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:40.360]  Medications that are, you know, old medication.
[2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:42.360]  Post concussion syndrome.
[2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:46.360]  You're going to see, I think the potential are falling down or get confused and not be able to answer.
[2:50:46.360 --> 2:50:49.360]  Mainstream media says no, nothing to see here.
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:52.360]  It's only a white right wing conspiracy.
[2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:54.360]  No, she's got serious health problems.
[2:50:54.360 --> 2:50:55.360]  Even Obama.
[2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:58.360]  You saw the Secret Service County runs up and says it's okay.
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:00.360]  And he has the pen, the doctor.
[2:51:00.360 --> 2:51:02.360]  And she looks completely insane.
[2:51:02.360 --> 2:51:05.360]  Yeah, I mean, and you can see her losing it.
[2:51:05.360 --> 2:51:08.360]  You know, these little seizures Hillary's having.
[2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:10.360]  The falling down.
[2:51:10.360 --> 2:51:12.360]  These are serious issues.
[2:51:12.360 --> 2:51:14.360]  And the mainstream media is covering it up.
[2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:16.360]  Just like they are the Clinton Foundation.
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:18.360]  But I think the facade is cracking.
[2:51:18.360 --> 2:51:23.360]  You see the New York Times saying the Clintons have got to close down the Clinton Foundation.
[2:51:23.360 --> 2:51:24.360]  That won't solve.
[2:51:24.360 --> 2:51:25.360]  I agree.
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:28.360]  I'm even seeing like a Washington Post out of this sea of lies.
[2:51:28.360 --> 2:51:30.360]  The Washington Post goes.
[2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:33.360]  Hillary really should have stood up for the gay people.
[2:51:33.360 --> 2:51:34.360]  Trump did.
[2:51:34.360 --> 2:51:35.360]  She lost an opportunity.
[2:51:35.360 --> 2:51:36.360]  Then we go to the gay prime president.
[2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:37.360]  We hate him.
[2:51:37.360 --> 2:51:38.360]  He wants to kill us.
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:39.360]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:51:39.360 --> 2:51:44.360]  Hillary saying that Donald Trump, you know, disabused a gold star parent.
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:49.360]  When Hillary Trump came back in Benghazi, we had the bodies coming back from Benghazi.
[2:51:49.360 --> 2:51:53.360]  Our ambassador, the others who died there and Hillary saying was caused by a movie.
[2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:56.360]  She's lying to their, to their parents.
[2:51:56.360 --> 2:51:58.360]  She says, what difference does it make?
[2:51:58.360 --> 2:52:00.360]  What difference does it make?
[2:52:00.360 --> 2:52:04.360]  We got Bill Clinton abusing women and Hillary abusing their victims.
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:08.360]  Her first court case was defeating a guy she knew was a rapist of a seven year old.
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:09.360]  I mean.
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:14.360]  Yeah, Apollo Jones that he paid 800 and some thousand dollars to settle a rape case with.
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:18.360]  And yet, you know, Hillary says she's for women.
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:20.360]  I gotta be honest with you.
[2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:21.360]  It's crazy.
[2:52:21.360 --> 2:52:22.360]  It's like they say he flip flops on immigration.
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:24.360]  He always said it's too hard to be legal.
[2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:26.360]  We're going to make it easier to be legal.
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:28.360]  But if you're a felon, we're kicking you out.
[2:52:28.360 --> 2:52:30.360]  Got a lot of bad folks coming in from Mexico criminals.
[2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:32.360]  And then they turn into all Mexicans or criminals.
[2:52:32.360 --> 2:52:36.360]  And now they say it's a flip flop when all he's doing is repeating what he always said.
[2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:39.360]  Except, you know, Donald Trump is brilliant.
[2:52:39.360 --> 2:52:41.360]  He's always been able to get the unearned media.
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:45.360]  He's very tough for these people to get because Donald Trump's used to New York.
[2:52:45.360 --> 2:52:47.360]  He's used to the media abuse.
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:49.360]  And unearned means he doesn't pay for it.
[2:52:49.360 --> 2:52:50.360]  And that's right.
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:54.360]  And the final analysis, everybody's talking about Trump and they will to the end.
[2:52:54.360 --> 2:52:59.360]  And if they're all talking about Donald Trump right to the end, it's his agenda.
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:00.360]  He's going to win.
[2:53:00.360 --> 2:53:05.360]  And it's going to be massive because I think you're going to find just like in the Brexit vote,
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:07.360]  they're going to tell you, oh, don't vote.
[2:53:07.360 --> 2:53:09.360]  Hillary's going to win.
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:10.360]  It's all useless.
[2:53:10.360 --> 2:53:11.360]  It's all done.
[2:53:11.360 --> 2:53:12.360]  It's all done.
[2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:14.360]  Donald Trump's dropping out next week.
[2:53:14.360 --> 2:53:20.360]  And the truth is they're scared to death because they see what's going to happen starting in the next two months.
[2:53:20.360 --> 2:53:24.360]  And that is people are going to wake up and they're going to start paying attention.
[2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:26.360]  And they're going to say Donald Trump is the real deal.
[2:53:26.360 --> 2:53:28.360]  Well, the algorithms show that.
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:31.360]  I mean, if people want anti-establishment, he said, I'm going to take a few phone calls.
[2:53:31.360 --> 2:53:33.360]  The book, Partners in Crime, available.
[2:53:33.360 --> 2:53:36.360]  Where's the best place, Dr. Corsi, for people to get this?
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:37.360]  Oh, thanks.
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:38.360]  It's available at all the bookstores.
[2:53:38.360 --> 2:53:42.360]  It's available at BarnesandNoble.com, Amazon.com.
[2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:45.360]  WND Superstore has copies that are signed.
[2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:47.360]  It's available everywhere.
[2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:48.360]  And thank you.
[2:53:48.360 --> 2:53:49.360]  I very much appreciate it.
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:50.360]  Hey, we're all in the same war together, brother.
[2:53:50.360 --> 2:53:51.360]  God bless you.
[2:53:51.360 --> 2:53:52.360]  Let's take a few calls here.
[2:53:52.360 --> 2:53:54.360]  Alex is calling in from Mexico.
[2:53:54.360 --> 2:53:57.360]  Trump set to meet the next 30 minutes with a Mexican president, which I think is a great move.
[2:53:57.360 --> 2:54:00.360]  Just like going to New Orleans was when Hillary wouldn't.
[2:54:00.360 --> 2:54:01.360]  Alex in Mexico.
[2:54:01.360 --> 2:54:03.360]  You're on the air with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:04.360]  Go ahead.
[2:54:04.360 --> 2:54:05.360]  Hello, guys.
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:06.360]  Good afternoon.
[2:54:06.360 --> 2:54:14.360]  Well, first, let me say really quick that Soros own Mexican media is going absolutely nuts.
[2:54:14.360 --> 2:54:19.360]  And they're accusing Mexican president of helping Donald Trump.
[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:26.360]  So I would have to ask you why would the Mexican government invite Donald Trump?
[2:54:26.360 --> 2:54:30.360]  I was about to say, Fox says you're not welcome here because he's a globalist selling Mexico out.
[2:54:30.360 --> 2:54:34.360]  Mexico has always been better than other Latin American countries about not selling its sovereignty.
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:36.360]  Under the NAU, it ends.
[2:54:36.360 --> 2:54:37.360]  And that's what I would be.
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:38.360]  I was Trump.
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:40.360]  I'd tell the Mexican people, hey, my country's mine.
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:41.360]  Yours is yours.
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:43.360]  We can work together, but we're being conquered by globalists.
[2:54:43.360 --> 2:54:45.360]  That's a great point, Dr. Corsi.
[2:54:45.360 --> 2:54:51.360]  Why did the Mexican president say two weeks ago I would meet with Trump and now Trump ran down there in a very honorable, respectful way?
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:56.360]  Well, I suspect that we better have double the security when Trump is down there.
[2:54:56.360 --> 2:54:58.360]  Oh, they admit the cartels are coming after him.
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  And secondly, I think that, you know, Donald Trump, the Mexican government may think they can embarrass Trump or that they can pull some stunt that will make Trump look bad.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:12.360]  And I'm sure the, you know, the New York Times would, by the way, is owned by Carlos Slim.
[2:55:12.360 --> 2:55:13.360]  Who runs a Mexican.
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:15.360]  Carlos Slim is in business with Soros.
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:17.360]  He's in business with the Clinton Foundation.
[2:55:17.360 --> 2:55:21.360]  Sure, but I mean, maybe they are Trump, but maybe they're hedging their bets because they know he's the guy.
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:22.360]  No, I don't.
[2:55:22.360 --> 2:55:24.360]  I think the main plan is to embarrass Trump.
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:28.360]  The narrative come out of this.
[2:55:28.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  Oh, like he was hated in Mexico.
[2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:30.360]  Look at this pathetic pig.
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:33.360]  Everybody sees the courage to go down there.
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:35.360]  Well, and I think that's what he's walking into a trap.
[2:55:35.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  Trump is communicating beyond the media.
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:41.360]  That's what scares the media so, so much.
[2:55:41.360 --> 2:55:44.360]  The New York Times knows it's losing its impact.
[2:55:44.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  The Wall Street Journal even is losing.
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:48.360]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:50.360]  I was asking, why are they so scared of Trump?
[2:55:50.360 --> 2:55:55.360]  I've never seen anyone, they're this, they're 50 times more scared of him than anybody I've ever seen.
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:55:57.360]  Well, they've almost won.
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:04.360]  They've gotten, they got, you know, one back Soros paid to get gone, but attack the advertisers, get him off.
[2:56:04.360 --> 2:56:05.360]  Sure, big rolled over.
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:06.360]  Pat Buchanan.
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:08.360]  I mean, it goes, this goes on and on.
[2:56:08.360 --> 2:56:09.360]  They've gotten the concern.
[2:56:09.360 --> 2:56:11.360]  They've told me if I don't roll over, it's over.
[2:56:11.360 --> 2:56:12.360]  I said, pull the trigger.
[2:56:12.360 --> 2:56:16.360]  I have done a single thing, not one interview with this book on Fox.
[2:56:16.360 --> 2:56:17.360]  Fox is boy.
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:20.360]  No, no, that's how you know we're two minutes to midnight.
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  They are shutting everything down, my friend.
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:25.360]  It's great to be here at the end with you being honorable, isn't it?
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:38.360]  Well, you know, look, I think Alex, we're going to win because I just can't believe that, you know, this great nation is going to roll over and let these globalists steal our freedoms and enslave us.
[2:56:38.360 --> 2:56:42.360]  Fundamentally, the American people, I think are out there and waking up.
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:43.360]  They're looking around.
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:46.360]  They're realizing they can't, you know, they're paycheck to paycheck.
[2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:47.360]  They don't even know they're going to keep.
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:48.360]  Exactly.
[2:56:48.360 --> 2:56:50.360]  And look how presidential Trump is.
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:53.360]  I mean, this guy is, I got to say, he's amazing.
[2:56:53.360 --> 2:56:57.360]  Well, and Trump is seriously in going to he has created jobs.
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:56:59.360]  Latinos look, African Americans look.
[2:56:59.360 --> 2:57:03.360]  Trump has employed more African Americans and more Latinos.
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:05.360]  He's done more for the minorities.
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:10.360]  Yeah, that's why Jesse Jackson, you know, gave him that award 20 years ago, that all the Democratic candidates put together.
[2:57:10.360 --> 2:57:13.360]  Hillary doesn't deploy, you know, African Americans.
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:16.360]  She's not deploying Hispanics, Hillary.
[2:57:16.360 --> 2:57:17.360]  Absolutely.
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:20.360]  Alex, have a quick comeback from Mexico with Dr. Corsi.
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:21.360]  Go ahead.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:22.360]  Quick comeback.
[2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:23.360]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2:57:23.360 --> 2:57:31.360]  I was thinking if the Mexican government maybe sees the things for which they are and they're not seeing Mr.
[2:57:31.360 --> 2:57:40.360]  Trump going second in the polls and that is why maybe they invited him because they see Hillary going down in the polls.
[2:57:40.360 --> 2:57:43.360]  That's what I think the courts, he usually has the inside baseball.
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:47.360]  This president has criticized him, but maybe he realizes what's going on.
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:49.360]  I mean, look, sovereignty is the way to go.
[2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:51.360]  Our countries aren't perfect, but you go with globalists.
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:57:52.360]  They will exploit you.
[2:57:52.360 --> 2:57:53.360]  They will screw you over.
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:54.360]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:57:54.360 --> 2:57:57.360]  I'm going to come back and take a few final calls from John and Mexico and JT code others.
[2:57:57.360 --> 2:57:58.360]  Dr. Corsi's got to go.
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:57:59.360]  Partners in crime.
[2:57:59.360 --> 2:58:01.360]  We got 60 seconds left for you to finish.
[2:58:01.360 --> 2:58:02.360]  So go ahead.
[2:58:02.360 --> 2:58:04.360]  Well, it's just been a great pleasure and honor to be with you again.
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:12.360]  I think the, you know, the whole purpose of partners in crime and the Clinton Foundation is to expose that these people are criminals.
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:23.360]  And that the Soros gang, the Clinton gang, even the mainstream media, you know, will go to any length to antagonize sponsors,
[2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:27.360]  to keep, suppress the truth, to keep a conservative message out.
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:29.360]  They don't want the First Amendment.
[2:58:29.360 --> 2:58:30.360]  They don't want the Second Amendment.
[2:58:30.360 --> 2:58:36.360]  That's right, they're coming after our funding so everybody fund us. Get the book, buy stuff at infowarstore.com, spread the word.
[2:58:36.360 --> 2:58:38.360]  It's how you win the war in 21st century warfare.
[2:58:38.360 --> 2:58:39.360]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[2:58:39.360 --> 2:58:41.360]  My great pleasure. Thank you.
[2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:44.360]  We'll be back with the fourth hour of your phone calls.
[2:58:44.360 --> 2:59:00.360]  70 seconds away.
[2:59:14.360 --> 2:59:16.360]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[2:59:16.360 --> 2:59:17.360]  It's got four and a half stars.
[2:59:17.360 --> 2:59:19.360]  People really love it.
[2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:20.360]  Read about it.
[2:59:20.360 --> 2:59:29.360]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[2:59:29.360 --> 2:59:33.360]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[2:59:33.360 --> 2:59:39.360]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:51.360]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[2:59:51.360 --> 3:00:01.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:10.360]  2 a.m., folks, and the hitman knows he's been cheated.
[3:00:10.360 --> 3:00:19.360]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[3:00:19.360 --> 3:00:23.360]  What if you had a chance to know the outcome before?
[3:00:23.360 --> 3:00:27.360]  What if you had a chance to not do it and actually learn from history?
[3:00:27.360 --> 3:00:32.360]  Headlines up on dredgerport.com.
[3:00:32.360 --> 3:00:35.360]  Donald Trump has landed in Mexico.
[3:00:35.360 --> 3:00:38.360]  Did he go ahead and meet with the president?
[3:00:38.360 --> 3:00:41.360]  Did he jump back on an airplane?
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:46.360]  And do three more campaign stops tonight.
[3:00:46.360 --> 3:00:51.360]  And they say he's not presidential material.
[3:00:51.360 --> 3:01:02.360]  Hillary Clinton can hardly walk when the bullet hits the bone.
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:05.360]  Oh, you will come to know.
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:09.360]  Globalists are going to find out when they finally engage the American people.
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:12.360]  The bullet's going to hit the bone.
[3:01:12.360 --> 3:01:19.360]  You're going to take all of our strengths, weakness, our kindness for weakness.
[3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:27.360]  In other words, just trying to give you a fair shot before we tear your arms out of your sockets politically.
[3:01:27.360 --> 3:01:32.360]  The real predator doesn't attack its own species.
[3:01:32.360 --> 3:01:34.360]  It has a governor.
[3:01:34.360 --> 3:01:39.360]  And you little pissant globalists don't have one of those.
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:45.360]  But history always offers up dumbasses that think they can set up their tyrannies.
[3:01:45.360 --> 3:01:53.360]  And when hundreds of millions of people are gone and dead, you'll be part of the ash heap of history.
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  Now, that's down one possible route.
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:57.360]  I hope we don't go that way.
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:01:58.360]  But I'm committed.
[3:01:58.360 --> 3:02:02.360]  I know you are beaten.
[3:02:02.360 --> 3:02:03.360]  I'll tell you what's scary, though.
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:06.360]  They've been really arrogant up until now, and that's why we've been really having an effect.
[3:02:06.360 --> 3:02:10.360]  They just now figured they put their arm in a wood chipper.
[3:02:10.360 --> 3:02:13.360]  They just now aren't being as arrogant.
[3:02:13.360 --> 3:02:15.360]  They've got some smart people.
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:17.360]  We're going to have some stuff to deal with.
[3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:22.360]  Don't make any mistake, but they're done.
[3:02:22.360 --> 3:02:24.360]  We've already got big blows in.
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:26.360]  We've already stabbed them a couple of times.
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:28.360]  They may get us.
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:30.360]  We got children.
[3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:33.360]  The globalists don't have cultural children, spiritual children.
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:34.360]  They don't have progeny.
[3:02:34.360 --> 3:02:35.360]  They're not in the life.
[3:02:35.360 --> 3:02:36.360]  They've got one life.
[3:02:36.360 --> 3:02:38.360]  That's why they don't want to lay it down.
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:39.360]  They want other people to lay it down.
[3:02:39.360 --> 3:02:43.360]  No, you're going to have to lay your life down for this.
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:45.360]  And so are we.
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:49.360]  But you see, escape is not our plan.
[3:02:49.360 --> 3:02:52.360]  You finally figured that out, didn't you, when you threatened us?
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:53.360]  Oh, you threatened us.
[3:02:53.360 --> 3:02:55.360]  Oh, my God, don't come get us.
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:00.360]  We don't want to make it easy for you, but we'll do anything to stand against you.
[3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:08.360]  Metaphysically, though, you're going to have to give ounce for ounce, pint for pint, gallon for gallon,
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  as much blood as we do.
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.360]  And we're ready to give the blood, just like we've given the energy and the time and the focus.
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:18.360]  Look how weak you are.
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:20.360]  Look how lazy you are.
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:21.360]  Look at you.
[3:03:21.360 --> 3:03:25.360]  Look at what you are.
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:33.360]  That's why you're preparing this hell for all of us because you're preparing your own kingdom that you will inherit, not us.
[3:03:33.360 --> 3:03:36.360]  John in Mexico, a lot of calls from Mexico.
[3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:38.360]  All of that, we should get calls from Mexico tomorrow.
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:43.360]  A lot of Mexican listeners, they had the flu down there and all that, phones were loaded, great intel.
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:47.360]  Go ahead, John, in Mexico, what's your view on all this?
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:48.360]  Hello, hi, Alex.
[3:03:48.360 --> 3:03:51.360]  Thank you for everything you and your team do, exposing corruption.
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:59.360]  My question is, how could a country like Mexico, which is a crown jewel in the New World Order, free itself from globalist control?
[3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:05.360]  You're talking about a country that is already run by the international megabacks where there is no Second Amendment
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:12.360]  and where the ex-minister of finance of Carlos Salinas is currently the head of the OECD.
[3:04:12.360 --> 3:04:13.360]  Absolutely.
[3:04:13.360 --> 3:04:15.360]  Here's the deal.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:21.360]  Mexico has more oil and more resources in the entire United States, one of the richest areas in the world other than some areas of Africa.
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:27.360]  Africa is per capita, per square inch is more than anybody else, but of course in the poorest, it's just like it's metaphysical.
[3:04:27.360 --> 3:04:30.360]  And then the crazy, evil Middle East gets all the money.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:32.360]  I mean, it's just, it's really twisted.
[3:04:32.360 --> 3:04:35.360]  Stay there, I'm going to come right back to you because you mentioned this, exactly.
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:37.360]  Mexico heads up the OECD that runs the whole deal.
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:42.360]  And it's because Mexico has more billionaires per capita than the other country in the world because it's got its people enslaved.
[3:04:42.360 --> 3:04:47.360]  And Mexico was starting to struggle out of that 10 years ago, so they started the big drug war down there.
[3:04:47.360 --> 3:04:53.360]  So, the globalist target countries that have the potential for strength, people can make jokes and say,
[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:56.360]  Mexico, potential for strength, absolutely it does.
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:04:58.360]  It has nationalism and they're not cowards.
[3:04:58.360 --> 3:04:59.360]  We'll be back.
[3:04:59.360 --> 3:05:05.360]  Italian authorities are so concerned with their youth joining the ranks of ISIS, they've decided to pay them not to.
[3:05:05.360 --> 3:05:11.360]  According to the Washington Post, half a million young Italians are about to receive free money to stay away from terrorism.
[3:05:11.360 --> 3:05:18.360]  Europe is in a free fall, struggling to counter the threat of ISIS and other groups that are aggressively recruiting in Western Europe.
[3:05:18.360 --> 3:05:25.360]  But Italy says they're keeping their kids away from terrorism by giving more than half a million 18-year-olds a voucher for $500.
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:30.360]  The voucher will allow the recipients to visit museums, go to concerts, even see movies that reduce prices.
[3:05:30.360 --> 3:05:33.360]  It sends a clear message, the program director said.
[3:05:33.360 --> 3:05:38.360]  He goes on to say, a welcome for those who reach the age of 18 and a reminder of how crucial culture is.
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:41.360]  They imagine terror, we answer with culture.
[3:05:41.360 --> 3:05:43.360]  They destroy statues, we love art.
[3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:51.360]  The cultural battle that he explains does not include curbing the mass influx of refugees into Italy from the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[3:05:51.360 --> 3:05:55.360]  Those refugees who carry those dangerous ideologies he's trying to combat.
[3:05:55.360 --> 3:06:24.360]  I'm Margaret Hall reporting for infowors.com.
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:26.360]  When it runs out, you start dying.
[3:06:26.360 --> 3:06:30.360]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[3:06:30.360 --> 3:06:33.360]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:35.360]  It works like an antioxidant.
[3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:38.360]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[3:06:38.360 --> 3:06:40.360]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[3:06:40.360 --> 3:06:42.360]  It's in powder form.
[3:06:42.360 --> 3:06:44.360]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[3:06:44.360 --> 3:06:45.360]  I take this.

[3:08:09.360 --> 3:08:14.360]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:14.360 --> 3:08:16.360]  I got meetings to go to.
[3:08:16.360 --> 3:08:22.360]  The woods are lovely dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep to quote a famous poem.
[3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:27.360]  I want to get a brief preview of what David Knight chomping a bit to take over has got to cover.
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:29.360]  I hit a few more calls.
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:33.360]  But everybody knows 10 years ago, they said, this show is depressing.
[3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:35.360]  You're talking about how we're way behind.
[3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:36.360]  All this horrible stuff is happening.
[3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:40.360]  I was telling people the truth about what was happening so we'd take action not to demoralize you.
[3:08:40.360 --> 3:08:45.360]  Now we're having victories and it doesn't mean the tide won't turn again.
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:52.360]  But this is the type of wargaming and real life action that changes the world.
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:59.360]  And I don't think this to be cliched or to be virtue signaling when somebody calls it from Mexico.
[3:08:59.360 --> 3:09:05.360]  But I'll tell you, it is a paradox that I talk to people from Mexico.
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:13.360]  And when we take calls from Mexico, they're probably on average the most informed people that I talked to.
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:18.360]  And then look at how Mexico is a hellhole.
[3:09:18.360 --> 3:09:21.360]  Well, that's what you get when you're next door to the New World Order.
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:25.360]  The U.S. has been captured.
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:29.360]  Mexico has this colonial history, but it's also got people that'll fight.
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:33.360]  Mexico for a long time wouldn't let multinationals take it over till the 80s.
[3:09:33.360 --> 3:09:34.360]  That's now happened.
[3:09:34.360 --> 3:09:37.360]  And so it's just all part of the same exploitation.
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:41.360]  They don't want to merge us with Mexico to empower Mexico or merge us with Canada.
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:46.360]  They want to merge us to create a new political system where we're all enslaved.
[3:09:46.360 --> 3:09:51.360]  And so the caller brings up how Mexico is heavily involved in global government.
[3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:53.360]  But I'd say it's really weird, actually.
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:59.360]  Per capita, Mexico, when it gets to the New World Order for its population of only 150 million,
[3:09:59.360 --> 3:10:04.360]  130 million is one of the most powerful groups in the New World Order.
[3:10:04.360 --> 3:10:06.360]  And I've tried to figure it out.
[3:10:06.360 --> 3:10:10.360]  I guess it's the money laundering, the drugs, the system they've got, a feudalism.
[3:10:10.360 --> 3:10:11.360]  I don't know.
[3:10:11.360 --> 3:10:16.360]  Let me ask the caller, then I'll go to David Knight.
[3:10:16.360 --> 3:10:18.360]  You guys are typing something on screen, too.
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:19.360]  It says Mexico independence.
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:21.360]  Or what are you saying?
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:22.360]  Oh, yes.
[3:10:22.360 --> 3:10:24.360]  It says September 16th.
[3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:25.360]  Yeah.
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:27.360]  John, I mean, you really brought up a lot of points.
[3:10:27.360 --> 3:10:32.360]  The average caller would know that I was mentioning the world government body earlier that nobody even knows the name of.
[3:10:32.360 --> 3:10:34.360]  You were pointing out Mexico is at the heart of that.
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:36.360]  So what do you think is going on?
[3:10:36.360 --> 3:10:38.360]  What do you think is happening?
[3:10:38.360 --> 3:10:45.360]  Well, I'm a trained attorney and those of us who have time to worry about Mexico becoming a full-fledged colony again are few.
[3:10:45.360 --> 3:10:53.360]  Mexico usually racks between the 13th and 15th economy in the world, but now has more billionaires in a few western European countries.
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:11:02.360]  And little of this has worked for the interest of the vast majority of the Mexican people, most of whom do not realize that they are slowly being turned into slaves of a group.
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:04.360]  They have no role in it.
[3:11:04.360 --> 3:11:08.360]  Let's be clear. The Mexican people are per capita.
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:11.360]  Mexico for your population has more billionaires than anybody else.
[3:11:11.360 --> 3:11:12.360]  So what does that say?
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:14.360]  Judge Street by Street, Mexico is incredible.
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:18.360]  It's produced more well per capita than any place in South Africa.
[3:11:18.360 --> 3:11:20.360]  So again, it's a paradox.
[3:11:20.360 --> 3:11:22.360]  What's going on?
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:25.360]  Well, I think you just touched the nail on the head.
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:28.360]  I think it's the result of abuse and concentration of power.
[3:11:28.360 --> 3:11:31.360]  And also there's a couple of things that I'd like to point out.
[3:11:31.360 --> 3:11:37.360]  There's education is incredibly poor and the control of the media has been going on for generations.
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:45.360]  Just this morning, I made a post on a mainstream newspaper and it was deleted within maybe 30 minutes.
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:48.360]  And it was pro-Trump and it was anti-globalist.
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:54.360]  And this is the third time this has happened to me just this week in mainstream media in Mexico.
[3:11:54.360 --> 3:11:56.360]  A few minutes more, sir.
[3:11:56.360 --> 3:11:59.360]  I mean, it's great to have you call in and break this down.
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:05.360]  Well, I guess sadly we're not surprised, for example, by the New York Times unfair releases or Carlos Lim's influence thereof,
[3:12:05.360 --> 3:12:09.360]  nor sadly even by rigged elections or embezzlement of foundation monies.
[3:12:09.360 --> 3:12:18.360]  This has gone on for so long here and there is such a distance between the powerful and the unpowerful here in Mexico
[3:12:18.360 --> 3:12:22.360]  that it really is a uphill battle against globalism.
[3:12:22.360 --> 3:12:25.360]  So that's why I wanted to pose that question to you.
[3:12:25.360 --> 3:12:32.360]  I mean, I mean, your question, but Mexico, that's what I was thinking earlier, is the model of modern neo feudalism.
[3:12:32.360 --> 3:12:33.360]  Is that it?
[3:12:33.360 --> 3:12:42.360]  Like the Mexican neocolonialists working for the New York banks, they have been the most successful at squeezing the most out of their people.
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:44.360]  I would definitely agree with that.
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:49.360]  However, I think a silent majority would agree with the Brexiters and with the nationalists.
[3:12:49.360 --> 3:12:51.360]  And I think...
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:52.360]  I want Mexico to be powerful.
[3:12:52.360 --> 3:12:53.360]  I want it to be wealthy.
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:55.360]  I want to have a great neighbor.
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:12:59.360]  Instead, it's just crazy how it's kept in poverty.
[3:12:59.360 --> 3:13:06.360]  Well, I think part of the solution might be in James Pinkerton's article today in Breitbart, which is titled Globalism Hits the Brick Wall.
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:09.360]  Now, what would Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton do?
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:12.360]  And I'll quote, the goal isn't socialism or anything like that.
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:19.360]  Instead, the goal is the widespread distribution of private property facilitated by conscious national economic development.
[3:13:19.360 --> 3:13:25.360]  Can you imagine if they gave real free market to Mexico or Venezuela or anywhere?
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:28.360]  I mean, Venezuela was rich before they brought in socialism.
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:29.360]  They threw that out the door.
[3:13:29.360 --> 3:13:32.360]  Can you imagine if you gave real private property to Mexico?
[3:13:32.360 --> 3:13:35.360]  How wealthy that place would be in 20 years?
[3:13:35.360 --> 3:13:45.360]  A lot of people joke here that Mexico is very close to the US, but very far from God.
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:49.360]  I'm right. All right, good to hear from you. Great points.
[3:13:49.360 --> 3:13:53.360]  We need people like that guy to like follow videos and speak out because that is so true.
[3:13:53.360 --> 3:13:54.360]  And it's sick.
[3:13:54.360 --> 3:14:00.360]  I mean, the wealth is unlimited people, but you can't have kingpins, el-hefe's running it.
[3:14:00.360 --> 3:14:03.360]  And look, the elite want to sew it up.
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:08.360]  They don't want you to have access to free market because they can't compete with it.
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:10.360]  We got a lot of phone lines here.
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:11.360]  If you want to take them, that's great.
[3:14:11.360 --> 3:14:12.360]  I apologize if I don't get to them.
[3:14:12.360 --> 3:14:14.360]  I've got to go to business meeting right now.
[3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:16.360]  But epic things happening.
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:21.360]  I mean, obviously you heard the show today where I talked about what we've known for a while, but it's really true.
[3:14:21.360 --> 3:14:24.360]  Info wars is at the heart of the resistance.
[3:14:24.360 --> 3:14:26.360]  And we need to say that because we need your prayers and support.
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:29.360]  We're under sickening behind the scenes attack.
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:31.360]  And I told people it's beyond a movie.
[3:14:31.360 --> 3:14:33.360]  I mean, it's been God's taking me through it.
[3:14:33.360 --> 3:14:34.360]  It's been very painful.
[3:14:34.360 --> 3:14:37.360]  And we've made it through it.
[3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:39.360]  And it's just another waves are coming.
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:44.360]  But it's still, I cannot believe the effect we're having.
[3:14:44.360 --> 3:14:46.360]  It is biblical day but night.
[3:14:46.360 --> 3:14:48.360]  I'm going to turn it over to you and leave right now.
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:49.360]  Go ahead, my friend.
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:50.360]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:14:50.360 --> 3:14:56.360]  And of course, we continually see you being called out increasingly by people even up to the level of Hillary Clinton.
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:14:58.360]  They have ignored you for a while.
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:02.360]  You kind of, you know, were very effective, but they didn't.
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:05.360]  As you pointed out earlier in the show, they would just refer to you as that guy in Texas,
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:10.360]  or they would say the dark corners of the Internet or the vast right wing conspiracy.
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:14.360]  Now they're calling you out by name, but you're talking about what's happening in Mexico
[3:15:14.360 --> 3:15:16.360]  and the kind of colonialism that we're seeing there.
[3:15:16.360 --> 3:15:19.360]  We're going to talk about what's happening here in America
[3:15:19.360 --> 3:15:24.360]  and the kind of colonialism of the connected and the billionaires,
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:28.360]  the kind of chronic capitalism that we've seen operating throughout the third world,
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:32.360]  throughout central and South America, throughout the Muslim world,
[3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:35.360]  throughout everywhere, essentially except America.
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:37.360]  Now it is coming here.
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:42.360]  If you want to get successful in America, what you do is you get political patrons like the Clintons.
[3:15:42.360 --> 3:15:44.360]  And of course, this all came home to roofs yesterday.
[3:15:44.360 --> 3:15:53.360]  This report that was up on the dredge report from Breitbart showing Bill Clinton saying he's going to rebuild Detroit using Syrian refugees.
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:54.360]  And I looked at that picture.
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:16:01.360]  I looked at this guy on the right who kind of looked like, it looked like a profile of Groucho Marx from this particular picture.
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:06.360]  Guy doesn't look like it that much in other pictures, talking to Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative.
[3:16:06.360 --> 3:16:07.360]  And he was somebody that I didn't know.
[3:16:07.360 --> 3:16:13.360]  And I thought, who is this guy that is pushing so hard for refugee resettlement here in the United States?
[3:16:13.360 --> 3:16:15.360]  And why is he pushing that hard?
[3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:16.360]  There you can see the picture of him right there.
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:18.360]  Why is he pushing that hard?
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:26.360]  And as I started looking at it, I realized this is a story of unbelievable takeover of our country.
[3:16:26.360 --> 3:16:33.360]  It's not just refugees coming in and taking blue-class factory jobs or middle-class jobs.
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:34.360]  So they're H-1B visas.
[3:16:34.360 --> 3:16:38.360]  No, they're coming in and they're taking over our entrepreneurship.
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:40.360]  They're taking over American businesses.
[3:16:40.360 --> 3:16:44.360]  They're taking that role and shutting us down using their connections in Washington.
[3:16:44.360 --> 3:16:47.360]  This guy's company, Chabani Yogurt, is a good example of this.
[3:16:47.360 --> 3:16:54.360]  And when you look at the small town, Twin Falls, Idaho, which as you may not have connected the dots,
[3:16:54.360 --> 3:16:58.360]  was the place that we heard of back in June where you had that five-year-old girl
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:04.360]  who was raped by a group of juvenile refugees in that city.
[3:17:04.360 --> 3:17:06.360]  It was covered up by the media.
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:09.360]  It was covered up by the local government.
[3:17:09.360 --> 3:17:11.360]  And you say, why were they doing that?
[3:17:11.360 --> 3:17:13.360]  Eventually, the truth did come out.
[3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:17.360]  And yet, the reason for that is because you've got this guy coming in
[3:17:17.360 --> 3:17:21.360]  and putting in the world's largest yogurt factory in a very small town.
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:26.360]  And you've got massive applications of money going in to buy up the media there.
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:29.360]  Now, we're going to talk at the bottom of the hour to Lee Strandhan,
[3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:34.360]  who's been doing a series of investigative reports in Twin Falls, Idaho.
[3:17:34.360 --> 3:17:37.360]  He's going to give us eye-witness reports about what's been going on there.
[3:17:37.360 --> 3:17:40.360]  Of course, there's been a series of reports that have been ongoing.
[3:17:40.360 --> 3:17:42.360]  But one of the things that you have to understand,
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:46.360]  we talked about this on the Nightly News last night in a YouTube video
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:52.360]  that's up on Alex's channel, revealed foreign Fed member behind refugee push.
[3:17:52.360 --> 3:17:58.360]  This guy, who remains a Turkish citizen, actually sets on the board of the New York Fed.
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:04.360]  And of course, the New York Fed is the preeminent Federal Reserve Bank organization.
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:06.360]  There's 12 of them throughout the country.
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:10.360]  But they're the ones who have the preeminent position, the first among equals.
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:12.360]  They're the ones who make the calls.
[3:18:12.360 --> 3:18:19.360]  This guy, who started out with a massive influx of money from the Small Business Association, $800,000.
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:21.360]  Hey, you know what?
[3:18:21.360 --> 3:18:24.360]  I started a business with my wife.
[3:18:24.360 --> 3:18:28.360]  My father and both of my grandfathers had businesses.
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:36.360]  They never got a cent, never a cent from the federal government to start their businesses or to expand their businesses.
[3:18:36.360 --> 3:18:42.360]  Politically connected people like this foreign billionaire, Hamdi Yulukhaya,
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:45.360]  are able to come in and get nearly a million dollars to start their business.
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:47.360]  And then what did he do?
[3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:52.360]  He went out and he bought both New York Senators and a large lobbying firm in Washington
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:56.360]  to get himself into the Michelle Obama School Lunch Program,
[3:18:56.360 --> 3:19:02.360]  where after a couple of years of liberally applied grease in the form of currency,
[3:19:02.360 --> 3:19:05.360]  he was able to get the school lunch program to say, hey, we're going to get rid of meat.
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:10.360]  And we're just going to start substituting his yogurt in the school lunch program.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:11.360]  Isn't that nice?
[3:19:11.360 --> 3:19:12.360]  Isn't that nice?
[3:19:12.360 --> 3:19:15.360]  And so we're going to take a look at what's happening there.
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:18.360]  But before we go to that, he's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:23.360]  When I look at this situation here of Homeland Security saying they're going to take over the elections,
[3:19:23.360 --> 3:19:28.360]  I knew when I saw this being put out there, hey, we got a couple of election boards that have been hacked,
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:30.360]  but don't worry that nothing has really happened.
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:35.360]  I told my wife when I saw that I said this is a false flag that is being set up.
[3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:38.360]  You know, we've had, of course, they can hack it.
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:40.360]  They've hacked all the federal employee personnel records.
[3:19:40.360 --> 3:19:44.360]  They've hacked the Federal Reserve notes, meeting notes,
[3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:50.360]  and they have actually hacked the NSA, stealing the NSA's hacking software and selling it on the Internet.
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:51.360]  So, of course, they can hack anything they want.
[3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:59.360]  But the simple solution to this is to simply have paper ballots and people observing the election.
[3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:06.360]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:27.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Of course, this is August 31st. This is the day 271 since Hillary Clinton has had a press conference.
[3:24:27.360 --> 3:24:34.360]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump has had 16 press conferences. He had about two press conferences a month.
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:41.360]  Hillary Clinton hasn't had one since last December before the first primary votes were held. Think about that.
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:51.360]  Think about the private, quiet, closed fundraisers that she has. Where the tickets are anywhere from $33,000 to $100,000 per person.
[3:24:51.360 --> 3:24:59.360]  She speaks to small groups. Nigel Farage said he's used to going at grassroots level, going around to small, cold rooms where he's talking to 50 people at a time.
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:10.360]  You know quite frankly, you see that all the time. Back in North Carolina I was involved in politics. Even the big name national politicians that would come through would speak to very, very small rooms.
[3:25:10.360 --> 3:25:22.360]  It's very unusual to see more than just a few dozen people in a room. Even when a big name politician with national status comes through, Donald Trump is speaking to football stadiums.
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:28.360]  Now, Hillary Clinton is speaking to small rooms, but small rooms so that people have a great deal of cash to give her.
[3:25:28.360 --> 3:25:32.360]  In the next segment, we're going to be talking to Breitbart reporter Lee Stranahan.
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:40.360]  And he's going to be talking about how this crony capitalism is manifesting itself in a very troubling way in Twin Falls, Idaho.
[3:25:40.360 --> 3:25:47.360]  The largest yogurt factory in the world. How did he get there? How did he build his business? It's a tale of crony capitalism.
[3:25:47.360 --> 3:25:53.360]  It's a tale of being connected to the Clintons. And so we're going to be talking to him in the next segment.
[3:25:53.360 --> 3:26:01.360]  Before we get back to the news and I want to talk about what's happening in Brazil because I think it truly is a harbinger of what we may be looking at here in this country.
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:07.360]  I want to point out to you that we've got a couple of specials. We've got 20% off vitamin mineral fusion drink.
[3:26:07.360 --> 3:26:18.360]  That's at infowarslife.com. While supplies last, a very easy and tasteful way to get your supply of vitamins and minerals is much easier than taking a slew of pills.
[3:26:18.360 --> 3:26:24.360]  Tastes great and you can get one month's supply out of that little container. Again, that's 20% off.
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:32.360]  Also, get your Hillary for Prison t-shirt at cost. You know, when Hillary called out Alex Jones and said he had a black heart, he said,
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:37.360]  okay, I'm going to run a black heart special, Hillary for Prison, at infowarsstore.com.
[3:26:37.360 --> 3:26:41.360]  We're just going to double down, folks, because the truth is on our side.
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:48.360]  Just $9.95 to support the operation and take a stand against Hillary Clinton to tell people that you know she is a corrupt criminal.
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:55.360]  And finally, our initial run of bio-true selenium is beginning to run low at infowarslife.com.
[3:26:55.360 --> 3:27:04.360]  Take a look at that essential nutrient and the form that it's in. It's 100% organic. It's pressed from organic mustard seed.
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:11.360]  Very important source of an essential nutrient that you need in your life and your family's life.
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:16.360]  That is bio-true selenium. It is our initial entry and it is beginning to run low.
[3:27:16.360 --> 3:27:23.360]  Now, what we have just learned is that the Brazilian president has just been ousted in an impeachment vote.
[3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:32.360]  This is on the Drudge Report. Washington Post says Brazil's Senate ousted Dilma Rousseff as president today voting overwhelmingly to impeach her.
[3:27:32.360 --> 3:27:38.360]  The culmination of a protracted process, it was not even close. It was 61 to 20 to impeach her.
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:46.360]  And the reason I think this is very important for us is because I reported on this back when there was the GOP primary in Utah.
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:52.360]  The GOP in Utah paid $80,000 to bring in a voting machine company called Smartmatic.
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:57.360]  They are the biggest voting machine, electronic voting machine company in the world.
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:01.360]  And guess where this started, okay? And who started it?
[3:28:01.360 --> 3:28:07.360]  Smartmatic began in Venezuela with close ties to Hugo Chavez.
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:11.360]  Many people believe that they're responsible for his luck on the elections there.
[3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:20.360]  But there have been reports of corruption and rigged elections throughout Central and South America, including the Philippines and including Brazil.
[3:28:20.360 --> 3:28:33.360]  We looked at the Philippines and other places. In some cases, 25% of the votes were lost without any record to be able to backtrack that.
[3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:39.360]  So we look at the fact that Homeland Security is saying, well, the electronic machines are hackable. Of course they are.
[3:28:39.360 --> 3:28:46.360]  Everything is hackable. There's not any. Even then I say, as I pointed out, their hacking software was hacked.
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:54.360]  How's that for recursive programming? Their hacking software was hacked and put on the Internet for sale in their face.
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:28:57.360]  They've hacked the minutes of the Federal Reserve, as we pointed out.
[3:28:57.360 --> 3:29:03.360]  That is incredible insider information that can be exploited financially. So of course, everything is hackable.
[3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:10.360]  But there is a very, very simple solution. And the US government knows it. They did it when they had elections in Iraq.
[3:29:10.360 --> 3:29:16.360]  They would validate people. They would come in. They would have the election on one day. You'd get your paint, your thumb painted purple.
[3:29:16.360 --> 3:29:20.360]  So you couldn't vote a second time. You don't extend this out forever.
[3:29:20.360 --> 3:29:25.360]  North Carolina is one of the worst cases. Voting is going to start in just a few days in North Carolina.
[3:29:25.360 --> 3:29:29.360]  In North Carolina, they have the longest voting period of anybody.
[3:29:29.360 --> 3:29:37.360]  And as I've said many times, my brother-in-law knows someone who went to the polling place because they don't require any photo ID.
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:41.360]  They said, you've already voted and so has this other person at your address who was his dead mother.
[3:29:41.360 --> 3:29:48.360]  What we're going to have if we don't go back to honest, simple elections with paper ballots and human monitors is fraud.
[3:29:48.360 --> 3:29:50.360]  That's how she got in.
[3:29:50.360 --> 3:29:56.360]  The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:21.360 --> 3:30:28.360]  Now this news comes as President Obama is planning on ramming through the passage of the TPP in coming days.
[3:30:28.360 --> 3:30:33.360]  The TPP that would irrevocably compromise the safety of our food supply here in the US
[3:30:33.360 --> 3:30:39.360]  and immediately open up the floodgates of seafood, poultry, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports to the country
[3:30:39.360 --> 3:30:43.360]  while we currently inspect only 2% of all food imports.
[3:30:43.360 --> 3:30:51.360]  The TPP would also allow foreign companies to compromise food safety decisions and force US inspectors to make new assessments very quickly.
[3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:56.360]  There are no resources or even a basic agreement in place to make sure that our food supply is safe.
[3:30:56.360 --> 3:31:14.360]  I'm Margaret Howe reporting for Infowars.com.
[3:31:27.360 --> 3:31:34.360]  Supermail vitality and so many others, but I am most proud of the product we're now launching today
[3:31:34.360 --> 3:31:40.360]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[3:31:40.360 --> 3:31:44.360]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[3:31:44.360 --> 3:31:51.360]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[3:31:51.360 --> 3:31:54.360]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[3:31:54.360 --> 3:31:57.360]  That's InfowarsWives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[3:31:57.360 --> 3:31:59.360]  Take action now before we sell out.
[3:31:59.360 --> 3:32:06.360]  Yeah, first of all, I want to say, secret 12, that's two Supermail Brainforce Prostigar Silver Bullet.
[3:32:06.360 --> 3:32:09.360]  I use them all. They're phenomenal. They work. Buy them, folks.
[3:32:09.360 --> 3:32:10.360]  Thank you, brother.
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:12.360]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[3:32:12.360 --> 3:32:18.360]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine products.
[3:32:18.360 --> 3:32:20.360]  Welcome to the Infowars.
[3:32:20.360 --> 3:32:25.360]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Infowar at the same time.
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:30.360]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, Casio FX, Mason, and I.
[3:32:30.360 --> 3:32:32.360]  Right. Let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[3:32:32.360 --> 3:32:35.360]  What are the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life?
[3:32:35.360 --> 3:32:36.360]  What products are you taking?
[3:32:36.360 --> 3:32:44.360]  Everything from Supermail to Brainforce to Winterson, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[3:32:44.360 --> 3:32:48.360]  So I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.
[3:32:48.360 --> 3:32:53.360]  Visit infowarslife.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourselves.

[3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:24.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[3:33:24.360 --> 3:33:27.360]  And joining me in this segment is going to be Breitbart Journalist.
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:29.360]  He's actually the lead investigative reporter at Breitbart News.
[3:33:29.360 --> 3:33:34.360]  He's the founder of CitizenJournalistsSchool.com, Lee Stranahan.
[3:33:34.360 --> 3:33:39.360]  And he's had a series of articles about what's going on in Twin Falls, Idaho.
[3:33:39.360 --> 3:33:41.360]  He said, well, why Twin Falls, Idaho? It's a very small town.
[3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:43.360]  It's got less than 50,000 people.
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:48.360]  Going back to August 10th, he had this story, Twin Falls Refugee Rape Special Report.
[3:33:48.360 --> 3:33:51.360]  Why are the refugees moving in in the first place?
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:55.360]  Two recent sexual assaults by Muslims in this community of about 50,000 people
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:58.360]  have made national headlines and raised a wider question.
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:02.360]  Why are the refugees in Twin Falls there in the first place?
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:06.360]  Well, the answer to that is Chobani Yogurt.
[3:34:06.360 --> 3:34:10.360]  The world's largest yogurt factory and the man behind it.
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:16.360]  And his story is an amazing story of how you can get ahead in the world today
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:20.360]  if you are a friend of the Clintons, if you buy influence with them.
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:23.360]  But, you know, as we look at this, and again, there was a lot of pushback
[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:27.360]  when this story was originally reported of the first rape of the little girl,
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:31.360]  five-year-old girl, who was raped by three other juveniles, reportedly.
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:34.360]  And there was a lot of pushback. There was pushback in the mainstream media.
[3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:37.360]  There was pushback in the local media. There was pushback in the local government.
[3:34:37.360 --> 3:34:41.360]  We've got Slate calling the Dredge Report and Infowars out.
[3:34:41.360 --> 3:34:43.360]  They said the Dredge Report trumpeted the Infowars story
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:47.360]  with headline Syrian refugees rape little girl at Knife Point in Idaho.
[3:34:47.360 --> 3:34:51.360]  They said, oh, this is just a bunch of unsubstantiated rumors.
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:54.360]  I had the mayor there attack the family on Facebook.
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:34:57.360]  Well, the truth will eventually come out.
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:35:01.360]  And one of the people who has been at the very epicenter of this, again,
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:04.360]  is lead investigative reporter for Breitbart News, Lee Stranahan.
[3:35:04.360 --> 3:35:07.360]  He's joining us on the line right now. Thank you for joining us, Lee.
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:09.360]  Yeah, David, thanks very much for having me.
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:12.360]  Give us an idea of why, you asked the question,
[3:35:12.360 --> 3:35:15.360]  why are the refugees and Twin Falls there in the first place?
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:19.360]  Can you answer that in your story? Tell us why they're there in the first place.
[3:35:19.360 --> 3:35:23.360]  Well, the short answer is cheap labor and local oligarchy.
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:25.360]  Let's be clear on what's going on here.
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:26.360]  Yes.
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:32.360]  And also, let's be clear that what's going on in Twin Falls is not unique to Twin Falls.
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:37.360]  This is really what's going on across the country and around the world.
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:40.360]  But it's going on across the country in the United States.
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:47.360]  The most interesting about Twin Falls is that I think it provides a real microcosm of the problem.
[3:35:47.360 --> 3:35:52.360]  This provides a real microcosm of the problem with globalism.
[3:35:52.360 --> 3:36:00.360]  And the impact that it has in areas from lawn order to public health to jobs and wages
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:02.360]  across the country.
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:06.360]  And so I've been embedded up here in Twin Falls for about a month now.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:08.360]  I'm going to be up here another couple of weeks.
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:13.360]  And really, because I think it hits on so many important issues.
[3:36:13.360 --> 3:36:18.360]  And often when we talk about these things on a national or international level,
[3:36:18.360 --> 3:36:22.360]  I think it's in a sense too abstract for people.
[3:36:22.360 --> 3:36:24.360]  You can get it, right?
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:29.360]  But when you see it at a ground level, the way things are working,
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:34.360]  in a town that is, like you say, about 50,000 people,
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:39.360]  it really comes into very, very sharp focus what we're up against here
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:47.360]  with this combination of big institutions, business, government, media,
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:52.360]  and even religion working on a local level.
[3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:54.360]  The same thing that we're seeing on a global level.
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:56.360]  So that's one of the things that's interesting.
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:36:58.360]  And they have a great activist community up here.
[3:36:58.360 --> 3:37:02.360]  One of the things about Twin Falls is they're actually doing something about it.
[3:37:02.360 --> 3:37:05.360]  People like my friend Julie DeWolf is up here.
[3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:11.360]  There's a group up here called We The People that have been really at the forefront
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:13.360]  in keeping this story alive.
[3:37:13.360 --> 3:37:18.360]  The sexual assault, the rape happened back on June 2nd and was buried.
[3:37:18.360 --> 3:37:22.360]  And I didn't even gain, I was covering the political conventions.
[3:37:22.360 --> 3:37:25.360]  And so I didn't get to it till the beginning of August.
[3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:29.360]  And other people were doing a great job, the activist up here,
[3:37:29.360 --> 3:37:33.360]  a number of other writers, you guys were on it.
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:39.360]  And the thing I've been really blessed to be able to do
[3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:45.360]  is to spend the time to do a deep dive in it and really start to look into the issues.
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:49.360]  And boy, I'll tell you, one thing that's very clear is the citizens of Twin Falls,
[3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:52.360]  the regular people, not the activists, just people living their life,
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:55.360]  they realize that they're being starved for information.
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:38:00.360]  They realize that the local media is the fixes in with that local media.
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:01.360]  And let's talk about that.
[3:38:01.360 --> 3:38:06.360]  That's a massive influx of capital from Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway,
[3:38:06.360 --> 3:38:12.360]  $11 million into this tiny town in order to buy the media, essentially.
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:15.360]  I think it's one of the reasons, I'm a conspiracy theorist, of course,
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:20.360]  but when you have that kind of influence there, you can suppress these stories.
[3:38:20.360 --> 3:38:23.360]  And they did that with the rape of that little five-year-old girl.
[3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:26.360]  And then, as you pointed out in your series of stories,
[3:38:26.360 --> 3:38:29.360]  because we've had the second rape happen in August,
[3:38:29.360 --> 3:38:33.360]  and that was the rape by a refugee who had been profiled
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:38.360]  as one of the shining examples of upstanding citizens that are being brought in.
[3:38:38.360 --> 3:38:41.360]  And he was profiled by this very same media,
[3:38:41.360 --> 3:38:45.360]  and then he turns around and allegedly rapes a 33-year-old, mentally retarded lady.
[3:38:45.360 --> 3:38:48.360]  Yeah, he molested her, he molested her.
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:50.360]  He was planning to rape her, he said.
[3:38:50.360 --> 3:38:52.360]  But she fled.
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:54.360]  And so that's an interesting part of the story,
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:57.360]  but I think it's also, as we look at this other story,
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:39:00.360]  what surfaced yesterday with Breitbart in Detroit,
[3:39:00.360 --> 3:39:03.360]  you've got Bill Clinton with the Clinton Foundation,
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:07.360]  the Clinton Global Initiative, and this guy who owns the yogurt factory there,
[3:39:07.360 --> 3:39:09.360]  that massive presence there.
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:13.360]  $450 million to start it, the world's largest yogurt factory.
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  He's now expanding it with another $100 million.
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:20.360]  So this thing continues to grow, and he's bragging about how he's got
[3:39:20.360 --> 3:39:24.360]  3% of his employees, there are refugees, they speak 11 different languages.
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:27.360]  I told my wife, I said, you know, he says,
[3:39:27.360 --> 3:39:31.360]  I've got translators for these 11 different languages, they're 24-7.
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:35.360]  And I said, it would be a lot cheaper, wouldn't it, just to teach them English.
[3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:39.360]  But he wants these people to be captive to him, doesn't he?
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:41.360]  That's right, we're probably to hire Americans,
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:43.360]  that's another wacky idea that I'd have.
[3:39:43.360 --> 3:39:47.360]  But maybe, I don't know, maybe like the veterans I've interviewed
[3:39:47.360 --> 3:39:50.360]  who applied and couldn't get a job there.
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:53.360]  Let's think about that irony for just one second.
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:57.360]  We have these global interests who start wars,
[3:39:57.360 --> 3:40:01.360]  like the war in Iraq, let's use that as an example.
[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:04.360]  A war that was supported by Bush and Clinton,
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:08.360]  not to be a conspiracy theorist, but that's just a fact, right?
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:13.360]  Then the war creates a situation where you have refugees,
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:17.360]  does that make sense? They've started a war, ruined the country.
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:19.360]  Now people want to flee the country.
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:24.360]  Then those people come to this country and take jobs
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:28.360]  that veterans of that war can't get.
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:30.360]  Think about that, and you're exactly right.
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:32.360]  The reason, it's not just wages,
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:35.360]  because the obvious thing is people go, well, they can pay them less or whatever.
[3:40:35.360 --> 3:40:38.360]  And that's true to some extent.
[3:40:38.360 --> 3:40:43.360]  They're not as likely to rise to the ranks
[3:40:43.360 --> 3:40:47.360]  and want more pay they need to work.
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:49.360]  But the other big issue is control.
[3:40:49.360 --> 3:40:52.360]  And there's also the issue that there's financial incentives.
[3:40:52.360 --> 3:40:58.360]  There's a pamphlet that the local refugee center put out.
[3:40:58.360 --> 3:41:01.360]  And they tell you, I did a story on it.
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:04.360]  It's really amazing. It was a really easy story to write, David.
[3:41:04.360 --> 3:41:09.360]  I just did copy and paste from the brochure.
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:13.360]  And the brochure was literally saying things like,
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:18.360]  if someone's from Afghanistan, be careful not to ask about their wife
[3:41:18.360 --> 3:41:20.360]  because they might seek revenge.
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:23.360]  That was the kind of thing they were saying in there.
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:28.360]  And they're telling employers, don't look if a person's from Eritrea,
[3:41:28.360 --> 3:41:31.360]  don't look them in the eye because they won't like that.
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:35.360]  Or all these things. And you'd think it would be easy just to say,
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:37.360]  hi, you're in America now.
[3:41:37.360 --> 3:41:41.360]  Chill. People are going to ask about your wife and look at you.
[3:41:41.360 --> 3:41:43.360]  And some people won't look at you.
[3:41:43.360 --> 3:41:46.360]  And some people won't ask about your wife and just chill.
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:49.360]  This is America. That's life. Get used to it.
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:52.360]  But instead, they have to tell the employers how to get used to it.
[3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:57.360]  And you mentioned the media here, the local newspaper.
[3:41:57.360 --> 3:42:02.360]  I got more interested in them when they did a editorial attacking Breitbart and me.
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:06.360]  As you may have noticed, Breitbart has come under some attacks
[3:42:06.360 --> 3:42:08.360]  for some reason the past couple of weeks.
[3:42:08.360 --> 3:42:09.360]  Exactly.
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:11.360]  Ever since Steve Bannon took over the Trump campaign,
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:13.360]  Hillary Clinton's talked about us.
[3:42:13.360 --> 3:42:15.360]  And she loves you guys as well.
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:17.360]  It's a badge of honor, isn't it?
[3:42:17.360 --> 3:42:19.360]  It's a badge of honor, isn't it?
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:20.360]  It sure is.
[3:42:20.360 --> 3:42:25.360]  But the local newspaper did an editorial that attacked me by name
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:28.360]  and attacked Breitbart. They said, well, I'm not a journalist.
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:30.360]  And I'm an activist.
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:34.360]  And I don't see any contradiction between being a...
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:36.360]  If they want to label me that way, great.
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:40.360]  I'm an activist who's done better journalism than the local paper.
[3:42:40.360 --> 3:42:41.360]  Let me put it that way.
[3:42:41.360 --> 3:42:44.360]  You know, Steve, they want to call me that. That's fine.
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:47.360]  You know, Lee, I think that we got to get rid of this idea
[3:42:47.360 --> 3:42:50.360]  that the mainstream media is perfectly objective.
[3:42:50.360 --> 3:42:54.360]  That is their main tool of deception to say that they don't have an opinion.
[3:42:54.360 --> 3:42:58.360]  I would rather, and I have always gotten my news from people who are up front
[3:42:58.360 --> 3:43:00.360]  about the fact that they have a point of view, that they have an opinion.
[3:43:00.360 --> 3:43:02.360]  If they don't understand what their bias is,
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:05.360]  then they're either ignorant or they're lying to you.
[3:43:05.360 --> 3:43:06.360]  Everybody has biases.
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:09.360]  Even the stories that you choose to report,
[3:43:09.360 --> 3:43:12.360]  that is an indication of what you're interested in
[3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:14.360]  or what your bias is or what your point of view is.
[3:43:14.360 --> 3:43:16.360]  So I think that whole idea...
[3:43:16.360 --> 3:43:21.360]  I can watch Rachel Maddow and I know where she comes from.
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:25.360]  So I can use that filter or whatever and she does a lot of very factual...
[3:43:25.360 --> 3:43:28.360]  She lays out facts a lot of the time and I can go,
[3:43:28.360 --> 3:43:32.360]  okay, well she's saying this, you know, Alex is saying that or whatever
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:36.360]  and I can just compare and figure things out on my own
[3:43:36.360 --> 3:43:37.360]  and I think most people can.
[3:43:37.360 --> 3:43:41.360]  What we learned about the local media is that they're owned by a company
[3:43:41.360 --> 3:43:45.360]  that was financed by Warren Buffett, head of Berkshire Hathaway,
[3:43:45.360 --> 3:43:47.360]  who's out on the stump for Hillary Clinton, right?
[3:43:47.360 --> 3:43:51.360]  We know that Warren Buffett is out on the stump promoting Hillary Clinton.
[3:43:51.360 --> 3:43:53.360]  And the other thing that's very interesting around town
[3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:58.360]  is Berkshire Hathaway Realty is a major player here in town.
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:02.360]  You see them doing commercial real estate and local real estate.
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:07.360]  So this little economic boom that's been created by the globalist here,
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:11.360]  gee, Warren Buffett's kind of making some money off of that, you see?
[3:44:11.360 --> 3:44:15.360]  And so the reason they're attacking me and Breitbart
[3:44:15.360 --> 3:44:20.360]  and you guys and anybody else reporting on this is real simple.
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:22.360]  We're bad for business, right?
[3:44:22.360 --> 3:44:23.360]  That's what it is.
[3:44:23.360 --> 3:44:27.360]  They're concerned that us raising these issues
[3:44:27.360 --> 3:44:31.360]  or the local activists raising these issues is bad for business.
[3:44:31.360 --> 3:44:34.360]  Now, it's bad for their business maybe, right?
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:36.360]  Because you got to remember when the factory was put up,
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:39.360]  it's the world's largest yogurt factory here.
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:42.360]  It was put up with tens of millions of dollars,
[3:44:42.360 --> 3:44:46.360]  about $54 million in government incentives.
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:48.360]  So it wasn't like they just built it on their own.
[3:44:48.360 --> 3:44:49.360]  Exactly.
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:52.360]  This is like the Olympics where cities compete, right?
[3:44:52.360 --> 3:44:54.360]  They want the business.
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:58.360]  And so the city council here bent over backwards
[3:44:58.360 --> 3:45:02.360]  or possibly a better analogy is they bent over forwards.
[3:45:02.360 --> 3:45:04.360]  Or bent over the taxpayer forward.
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:05.360]  Exactly right.
[3:45:05.360 --> 3:45:09.360]  And again, you know, it's the kind of thing we see all the time
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:12.360]  where big businesses, and I don't care whether it's Walmart,
[3:45:12.360 --> 3:45:16.360]  which is very American, they get all these incentives.
[3:45:16.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  And I'll tell you what happens.
[3:45:17.360 --> 3:45:20.360]  One of the things, this story in Twin Falls,
[3:45:20.360 --> 3:45:23.360]  a lot of it is about unintended consequences.
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:30.360]  So that girl got raped because they brought in refugees as cheap labor,
[3:45:30.360 --> 3:45:36.360]  which happened because they had economically wanted to get this yogurt factory here
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:41.360]  and the guy who runs the yogurt factory is a major booster of the refugee program.
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:45.360]  And when I say booster, I mean working with the Clintons,
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:48.360]  working with Chuck Schumer, and working with Republicans,
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:50.360]  like the Republican governor here, butch Otter.
[3:45:50.360 --> 3:45:51.360]  Yes.
[3:45:51.360 --> 3:45:54.360]  And going to Davos and telling getting commitments,
[3:45:54.360 --> 3:45:59.360]  he set up a tent foundation to bring in refugees saying they're the best.
[3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:01.360]  And that's what he was doing with Bill Clinton when they were talking about Detroit.
[3:46:01.360 --> 3:46:04.360]  They said, hey, we got all these empty homes, we can give them to the refugees.
[3:46:04.360 --> 3:46:06.360]  And they're great employees.
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:11.360]  Today or tomorrow on Breitbart, that goes into more detail about some of this stuff.
[3:46:11.360 --> 3:46:15.360]  Hamdi Alakai, who is not, let me, I just want to make this clear, he's not a U.S. citizen.
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:16.360]  That's right.
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:17.360]  That's fine, but let's be clear.
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:20.360]  And yet he's on the New York Fed board.
[3:46:20.360 --> 3:46:25.360]  I'm sure that doesn't, anyone who listens to the info wars, that doesn't mean anything.
[3:46:25.360 --> 3:46:32.360]  But and he's working with John Podesta's group with Center for American Progress,
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:37.360]  quoting, doing a report that quotes the IMF, the International Monetary Fund.
[3:46:37.360 --> 3:46:40.360]  Again, that won't mean anything to listeners of info wars.
[3:46:40.360 --> 3:46:44.360]  But I mean, I'm saying that facetiously, but here's the thing.
[3:46:44.360 --> 3:46:48.360]  The people who listen to you guys, the people who listen to Breitbart,
[3:46:48.360 --> 3:46:51.360]  they know who the IMF, the people who read Breitbart, they know who the IMF is.
[3:46:51.360 --> 3:46:54.360]  They know what the Fed is and what that means.
[3:46:54.360 --> 3:47:00.360]  Most people are busy with their lives and kids and jobs, right?
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:05.360]  So they don't know, if I say, well, they did a report with Podesta and the IMF,
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:08.360]  they don't understand the implication of that.
[3:47:08.360 --> 3:47:11.360]  The implication is these guys all work together.
[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:15.360]  This is a group of people, guys and gals with Thurgillary in there.
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:17.360]  They all work together, right?
[3:47:17.360 --> 3:47:23.360]  And they're all jetting off to Davos and doing Huffington Post editorials and everything else,
[3:47:23.360 --> 3:47:24.360]  working together.
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:32.360]  But at the same time, like I say, you end up with this situation where we really wanted to do in Twin Falls,
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:38.360]  was look into the causation and then the ripple effect that this has had throughout the city,
[3:47:38.360 --> 3:47:41.360]  and then show how that's worked in other places.
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:45.360]  Now, Hamdi Ulykai is not a U.S. citizen.
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:48.360]  In 2000, let me back up one second.
[3:47:48.360 --> 3:47:53.360]  So he became friends with Chuck Schumer because he's got another factory in New York.
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:55.360]  That's where his first factory was, yeah.
[3:47:55.360 --> 3:48:02.360]  Chuck Schumer urged him to be part of the federal school lunch program.
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:06.360]  And I'm going to avoid getting details on that right now because I don't want to be confusing.
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:13.360]  So Chuck Schumer buddies up to Hamdi Ulykai and vice versa because it's good for Hamdi's business
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:19.360]  and it's good for Chuck's political career now and for the constituents in New York.
[3:48:19.360 --> 3:48:25.360]  So what they do is, in 2013, when Chuck Schumer was part of the gang of aid pushing for open borders,
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:31.360]  guess who becomes a special guest and visits with President Obama in the White House
[3:48:31.360 --> 3:48:34.360]  to promote comprehensive immigration reform?
[3:48:34.360 --> 3:48:36.360]  That would be Hamdi Ulykai.
[3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:38.360]  So think about that.
[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:42.360]  We have a non-U.S. citizen, which is, again, that's fine.
[3:48:42.360 --> 3:48:47.360]  But pushing for immigration reform in America,
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:52.360]  when it's an issue that he clearly, he's not a citizen, pushing for that,
[3:48:52.360 --> 3:49:01.360]  I would not expect to go to Australia and push for more immigration to Australia because I'm not Australian.
[3:49:01.360 --> 3:49:03.360]  It's just mind-boggling, yeah, exactly.
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:08.360]  How does he have the authority to go in and tell us how many people we should bring into our country
[3:49:08.360 --> 3:49:09.360]  that aren't Americans?
[3:49:09.360 --> 3:49:14.360]  He's not even an American and he's sitting on the Fed board where they're making economic policy.
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:17.360]  But the New York Fed is the center of the Fed.
[3:49:17.360 --> 3:49:20.360]  And this guy is there and he's a Turkish citizen.
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:22.360]  And we have a story coming at Breitbart.
[3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:25.360]  My colleague, Michael Patrick Lay, he's been great on this.
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:26.360]  Now think about this.
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:30.360]  We contacted Giovanni and asked him a simple question.
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:34.360]  We're just confirming that he's a U.S. citizen or not.
[3:49:34.360 --> 3:49:39.360]  Forbes reported, and I link to it, Forbes reported he's not a U.S. citizen.
[3:49:39.360 --> 3:49:44.360]  Their response, now you think that's an easy question, right? No comment.
[3:49:44.360 --> 3:49:46.360]  No comment.
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:49.360]  I bet they don't want to hear it.
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:54.360]  Yeah, but he brags on his Ted Foundation that he is a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York.
[3:49:54.360 --> 3:49:55.360]  That's exactly right.
[3:49:55.360 --> 3:49:56.360]  And he brags about that.
[3:49:56.360 --> 3:49:58.360]  So here's what happens.
[3:49:58.360 --> 3:50:02.360]  The White House needs these dog and pony shows.
[3:50:02.360 --> 3:50:09.360]  You know, immigrants, businessmen, successful entrepreneurs also support comprehensive immigration reform.
[3:50:09.360 --> 3:50:11.360]  So he's out there.
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:12.360]  You can look this up.
[3:50:12.360 --> 3:50:13.360]  It's on C-SPAN.
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:14.360]  He makes his statement.
[3:50:14.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  Steve Case from AOL makes his statement.
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:17.360]  These other guys.
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:18.360]  And they come out.
[3:50:18.360 --> 3:50:19.360]  So the U.S.
[3:50:19.360 --> 3:50:24.360]  So what's in it for the government is their little puppets in the dog and pony show.
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:25.360]  Oh, look.
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:26.360]  How do you look?
[3:50:26.360 --> 3:50:27.360]  He's a successful immigrant.
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:28.360]  He's a successful entrepreneur.
[3:50:28.360 --> 3:50:34.360]  But what they don't tell you is that part of his success is that Chuck Schumer, two weeks ago,
[3:50:34.360 --> 3:50:36.360]  he's again, conspiracy theory, right?
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:37.360]  He goes to the White House.
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:38.360]  He makes the statement.
[3:50:38.360 --> 3:50:42.360]  Two weeks later, the White House comes out and says, guess what?
[3:50:42.360 --> 3:50:45.360]  We'd like Greek yogurt, not any yogurt.
[3:50:45.360 --> 3:50:47.360]  Greek yogurt, which is what Trobani yogurt is.
[3:50:47.360 --> 3:50:48.360]  Yeah.
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:50.360]  To become part of the federal school lunch program.
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:53.360]  And he basically owns the Greek yogurt segment.
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:54.360]  He's got more than 50%.
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:50:59.360]  And stay with us. We'll be right back with Lee Stranahan, Breitbart lead investigative reporter at...
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:02.360]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[3:51:02.360 --> 3:51:06.360]  Most basic diseases are caused by yeast in the gut and metals in the liver.
[3:51:06.360 --> 3:51:08.360]  And we all have a bit of both.
[3:51:08.360 --> 3:51:13.360]  The garlic in Extendivite has a yeast killing effect in the gut while also helping the sulfur
[3:51:13.360 --> 3:51:15.360]  enzyme in the liver get rid of the metals.
[3:51:15.360 --> 3:51:19.360]  Extendivite just may improve your overall health.
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:24.360]  Products like Extendivite are the only way we're going to get our society healthy.
[3:51:24.360 --> 3:51:28.360]  And if you're waiting for the government and pharmaceutical care to solve your health problems,
[3:51:28.360 --> 3:51:31.360]  you're going to have a long disappointing wait, I think.
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:36.360]  Extendivite is a complete formula for extended life in the new millennium.
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:38.360]  80 can be the new 60.
[3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:43.360]  Extendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a two month supply.

[3:53:50.360 --> 3:53:53.360]  That's 866-389-0620.
[3:53:53.360 --> 3:54:06.360]  Again, 866-389-0620.
[3:54:24.360 --> 3:54:30.360]  He is in Twin Falls, Idaho, looking at what's happening with the refugee situation there.
[3:54:30.360 --> 3:54:35.360]  And of course, the billionaire who is an advocate for bringing in refugees has just pointed out,
[3:54:35.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  here's a guy who is speaking at the UN meeting with President Obama telling us
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:44.360]  that we need to bring in more and more refugees.
[3:54:44.360 --> 3:54:47.360]  As we saw this article that was up yesterday on Breitbart,
[3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:55.360]  Bill Clinton meeting with Hamdi Yulukhaya and he is saying, hey, let's fill Detroit with refugees.
[3:54:55.360 --> 3:54:58.360]  We've got 10,000 empty homes, let's just bring these guys in.
[3:54:58.360 --> 3:55:02.360]  They're better than the people who are already there, black and white.
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:05.360]  And it's interesting, if you look at the proposals that Hillary Clinton has,
[3:55:05.360 --> 3:55:09.360]  she's proposing to bring in more than the current population of Detroit
[3:55:09.360 --> 3:55:11.360]  in terms of just refugees alone.
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:14.360]  We don't have any way to vet who these people are.
[3:55:14.360 --> 3:55:19.360]  We go into the country, we start a war, and then we bring in the angry people into this country
[3:55:19.360 --> 3:55:22.360]  without being able to vet them, saying they're refugees.
[3:55:22.360 --> 3:55:24.360]  There's other ways to help them.
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:27.360]  One of the ways might be to stop the war we started.
[3:55:27.360 --> 3:55:29.360]  Before we go back to Lee and finish up,
[3:55:29.360 --> 3:55:32.360]  I want to tell you about a couple of specials that we have here at InfoWars.
[3:55:32.360 --> 3:55:34.360]  Of course, that's the way we support ourselves.
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:41.360]  It's the way that we keep ourselves independent of the kind of levers that they apply
[3:55:41.360 --> 3:55:44.360]  in terms of pressure to the mainstream media.
[3:55:44.360 --> 3:55:47.360]  We sell directly, we sell products that will help you,
[3:55:47.360 --> 3:55:49.360]  and that helps us to keep our operation going.
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:52.360]  Right now, we have a sale on vitamin mineral fusion drink mix.
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:55.360]  That's at infowarslife.com, 20% off.
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:59.360]  That's one month's supply of essential vitamins and minerals
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:04.360]  in a very easy to swallow, liquid format, and also very tasty.
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:07.360]  Again, that's vitamin mineral fusion drink.
[3:56:07.360 --> 3:56:11.360]  It has all the essential vitamins and minerals that you're going to need
[3:56:11.360 --> 3:56:14.360]  for supplementation in an easy to swallow, tasteful drink.
[3:56:14.360 --> 3:56:18.360]  Also, we have discounted the Hillary for Prison t-shirts
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:21.360]  as part of our Black Heart Special.
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:22.360]  Take this, Hillary.
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:25.360]  We're going to give these things away at cost.
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:29.360]  You can get them at 9.95 at infowarsstore.com.
[3:56:29.360 --> 3:56:34.360]  This is a great way to send the message that you know exactly where Hillary belongs.
[3:56:34.360 --> 3:56:36.360]  The big house, not the white house.
[3:56:36.360 --> 3:56:40.360]  Let's go back to Lee Stranahan, who is in Twin Falls, Idaho,
[3:56:40.360 --> 3:56:46.360]  as you were talking about how easy it was for him to get not only yogurt
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:50.360]  in Michelle's school lunch program, but specifically the kind of yogurt
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:53.360]  that he sells, that he has a market dominance in.
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:56.360]  Of course, he did that with just eight months of lobbying,
[3:56:56.360 --> 3:57:00.360]  but with massive amounts of cash being spent in Washington.
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:04.360]  He started out his business with an $800,000 small business loan,
[3:57:04.360 --> 3:57:07.360]  but he put in $700,000 worth of lobbying
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:10.360]  through the cornerstone government lobbying firm.
[3:57:10.360 --> 3:57:13.360]  And it got some pretty good results for him, didn't it, Lee?
[3:57:13.360 --> 3:57:16.360]  Yeah, I mean, he's been doing, it's over $700,000 over years,
[3:57:16.360 --> 3:57:19.360]  over about six years now, when all this stuff started.
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:22.360]  And again, this can't be emphasized enough.
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:23.360]  You hit it.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:26.360]  But Chuck Schumer, see, here's the thing.
[3:57:26.360 --> 3:57:30.360]  They're not subtle about the puppet show.
[3:57:30.360 --> 3:57:32.360]  They're not subtle about it.
[3:57:32.360 --> 3:57:37.360]  But they know that most people won't even do one layer of research down.
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:38.360]  Does that make sense?
[3:57:38.360 --> 3:57:39.360]  Yeah.
[3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:41.360]  Just most people are just, again, I get it.
[3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:43.360]  People are busy and they can't research everything.
[3:57:43.360 --> 3:57:46.360]  So they see the guy come out at the White House
[3:57:46.360 --> 3:57:48.360]  and they go, okay, well, it seems like a business guy
[3:57:48.360 --> 3:57:51.360]  is in favor of this comprehensive immigration form.
[3:57:51.360 --> 3:57:55.360]  They don't read The Hill, which is an inside the Beltway publication.
[3:57:55.360 --> 3:57:58.360]  So they missed The Hill saying two weeks later,
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:02.360]  oh, by the way, the White House wants to push for Greek yogurt
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:04.360]  being part of the school lunch program.
[3:58:04.360 --> 3:58:09.360]  They don't read the local Albany paper that says,
[3:58:09.360 --> 3:58:12.360]  you know, Chuck Schumer is doing this and promoting this.
[3:58:12.360 --> 3:58:14.360]  We're running out of time, Lee.
[3:58:14.360 --> 3:58:16.360]  Tell people, you're going to be there for a while.
[3:58:16.360 --> 3:58:18.360]  You're doing a whole series of investigations
[3:58:18.360 --> 3:58:21.360]  on what's going on with the refugee situation in Idaho,
[3:58:21.360 --> 3:58:23.360]  the fact that they are replacing Americans
[3:58:23.360 --> 3:58:26.360]  from the worker all the way up to the CEO.
[3:58:26.360 --> 3:58:28.360]  You're going to be there for a while.
[3:58:28.360 --> 3:58:30.360]  You're with Breitbart News. This is Lee Strenahan.
[3:58:30.360 --> 3:58:32.360]  Join us tonight at 7 central APM Eastern
[3:58:32.360 --> 3:58:34.360]  for the Info Wars Nightly News. Thank you so much, Lee.
[3:58:34.360 --> 3:58:36.360]  You're awesome. Thanks very much.
