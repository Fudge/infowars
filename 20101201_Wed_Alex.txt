[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.520 --> 00:30.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.760]  well I got some really bad news last night from Congressman former
[00:36.760 --> 00:41.480]  Congressman Bob Barr's office that runs a major watchdog organization
[00:41.480 --> 00:46.520]  investigating government abuse and tyranny and they filed Freedom of
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.280]  Information Act request dealing with this on the reports that came out last
[00:52.280 --> 01:00.120]  week that the Department of Homeland Security and its subsidiary of minimum
[01:00.120 --> 01:06.800]  wage goons aren't just putting Congress people in Hollywood folks that they
[01:06.800 --> 01:12.040]  don't like on no fly list that's come out for years as part of political
[01:12.040 --> 01:18.920]  persecution but that they have been basically listing people in the media
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.720]  reportedly who have been critical of DHS sticking their hands down people's
[01:23.720 --> 01:29.480]  pants fondling one-year-old children fondling women's breast ripping
[01:29.480 --> 01:34.880]  piercings out of people's breast and genitals the list goes on and on but
[01:34.880 --> 01:39.280]  that they're actually putting you on a domestic extremists list so they can
[01:39.280 --> 01:44.320]  then surveil you and spy on you so they're committing the crimes with
[01:44.320 --> 01:47.960]  churned off and alfons de motto and the rest of them of being government
[01:47.960 --> 01:52.760]  officials previously and then ordering clearly former Homeland Security had
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.440]  churned off is guilty of this and then lobbying and ordering the naked body
[01:56.440 --> 02:03.960]  scanners and then becoming the heads of those companies to make millions of
[02:03.960 --> 02:08.840]  dollars individually billions total in the aggregate of the thousands and
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.680]  thousands of more machines are indeed ordered as they've already ordered them
[02:12.680 --> 02:16.120]  but if they're completed and delivered if these contracts aren't canceled so
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.760]  billions of dollars is at stake here you better believe this out-of-control goon
[02:20.760 --> 02:28.880]  government will use its secret police and its frontline groped down police to
[02:28.880 --> 02:34.480]  intimidate and not just enforce the submission at airports but on trains
[02:34.480 --> 02:39.200]  buses highways malls they've announced that they will now be our new federal
[02:39.200 --> 02:43.400]  minders and they're training them to violate us in the airports but now to
[02:43.400 --> 02:49.480]  roll them out on the streets but you heard me right this is the headline up

[03:43.120 --> 03:48.080]  it because of the new enhanced down-your-pants rapedowns then Michelle
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.480]  who works here had just flown back with her family from a visit to Colorado her
[03:53.480 --> 03:58.960]  20-month-old baby daughter a little cupcake and her eight-year-old who I've
[03:58.960 --> 04:01.920]  known for years she's worked here five years I knew the eight-year-old but she
[04:01.920 --> 04:05.960]  was a toddler basically and they tried to have men grab them she said no so
[04:05.960 --> 04:12.160]  women grab their genitals a man did fondle Michelle and drudge picked up the
[04:12.160 --> 04:16.040]  video and it started a catalyst and then he ran with our stories every day for
[04:16.040 --> 04:21.960]  about a week or two until the media picked up and the frenzy began so
[04:21.960 --> 04:31.880]  reportedly they have list of people and media the Forbes magazine writer said

[07:02.280 --> 07:06.560]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[07:06.560 --> 07:09.920]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.840]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[07:13.840 --> 07:18.040]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[07:18.040 --> 07:22.480]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[07:22.480 --> 07:27.240]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:27.240 --> 07:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:31.040 --> 07:34.640]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.640 --> 07:39.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[08:04.600 --> 08:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.360 --> 08:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.880 --> 08:30.160]  Alex Jones we first started reporting on it last Wednesday on national opt-out
[08:30.160 --> 08:36.120]  day that the system didn't want to give the American people who in the vast
[08:36.120 --> 08:41.560]  majority of polls are completely against the TSA radiation scanners and the
[08:41.560 --> 08:45.920]  hands down the pants they didn't want to give us a chance to stand up and win
[08:45.920 --> 08:52.280]  and have a victory so they ran a hoax on record now days after we reported on it
[08:52.280 --> 08:58.600]  and Gizmodo reported on it Drudge reported on it all on that Wednesday we
[08:58.600 --> 09:02.360]  all basically simultaneously broke at the same time from our listeners taking
[09:02.360 --> 09:09.320]  photos and reporting to us that at major international airports JFK LaGuardia
[09:09.320 --> 09:18.040]  Denver Dallas where they have the scanners in place they stood down they
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.720]  turned them all off and didn't even do pat downs they went back to the old
[09:21.720 --> 09:28.880]  ones if they even did that it was just people racing through and now that has
[09:28.880 --> 09:32.240]  been confirmed by the Associated Press and many other publications that
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.120]  indeed they did stand down nationwide in the airports that have put them in now
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.360]  this is a big deal this is a serious criminal act if you believe Homeland
[09:45.360 --> 09:51.600]  Security and their subsidiary TSA that they've got to stick their hands down
[09:51.600 --> 09:56.400]  grandma's pants they've got to radiate your two-year-old they've got to lift
[09:56.400 --> 09:59.880]  your dress up and take your blouse off in front of people you've got to take
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.440]  your colostomy bag out and they'll just rip it right out of you that's on record
[10:04.440 --> 10:10.920]  or your urology bag this is on record mainstream news meanwhile TSA on
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.720]  records hiring child molesters stalkers rapist that's all come out and they say
[10:15.720 --> 10:20.080]  that that doesn't bar them well Stalin emptied out the prisons of hardened
[10:20.080 --> 10:24.360]  criminals to be his secret police they were the ones that would stand behind
[10:24.360 --> 10:29.080]  the military with guns and make them go fight Stalin was a bank robbing criminal
[10:29.080 --> 10:34.600]  ex-con so of course they're filled with ex-cons and little petty power trip
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.920]  people and this is going to be the new federal police force for America long as
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.120]  you weigh 400 pounds and hate freedom you get the job and I'm not bashing folks
[10:44.120 --> 10:47.440]  that are overweight I'm a bit overweight myself been way overweight before it
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.120]  just it's bizarre that it seems to be a job prerequisite to to look like
[10:52.120 --> 10:56.080]  Baron Harkin and her job of the hut to get one of these jobs I think they're
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.880]  discriminating against people that are underweight or normal weight but but
[11:00.880 --> 11:08.600]  side issue here side issue they need to be criminally investigated but how does
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.640]  the government investigate itself they always claim national security well you
[11:11.640 --> 11:15.080]  have state grand juries federal grand juries go after them congressional
[11:15.080 --> 11:19.080]  hearings we need them now we need to start calling Congress and the new
[11:19.080 --> 11:22.800]  Congress coming up and demanding I'm gonna call Rand Paul I'm gonna call Ron
[11:22.800 --> 11:26.360]  Paul I know he already wants hearings dr. Paul I know that he's already
[11:26.360 --> 11:30.440]  introducing a bill to point out that they have to follow the law and that
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.480]  groping and radiating people is illegal but we need hearings and we need to cut
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.280]  the funding of this agency we need airports to throw them out which they're
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.640]  already doing because there's no law they're just having the airports invite
[11:44.640 --> 11:51.440]  the vampires in we demand that if they want to put a a a a obese army of
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.160]  control freaks somewhere stick them on the southern border let them actually
[11:56.160 --> 11:59.640]  deal with the Mexican military in a real threat and the drug cartels and the
[11:59.640 --> 12:04.360]  coyotes and all the crime pouring across the 28,000 murders in the last two
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.120]  years that's a higher death rate per year than the height of the Vietnam War let
[12:08.120 --> 12:15.440]  them deal with that but DHS on record now and this is confirmed we've got all
[12:15.440 --> 12:19.400]  the mainstream news articles posted TSA turns off naked body scanners to avoid
[12:19.400 --> 12:23.880]  opt-out day protest and we have links in this article by Paul Joseph Watson this
[12:23.880 --> 12:27.480]  is from the 25th last week to all the mainstream news articles confirming it
[12:27.480 --> 12:34.120]  but Rob do and Aaron Dykes I sent them to interview somebody in the Dakotas
[12:34.120 --> 12:37.760]  they were flying back to be with their families through Denver on opt-out day
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.680]  where Michelle a month ago one of my employees had herself by a man grab her
[12:43.680 --> 12:48.720]  genitals there at Denver her 20 month old daughter and her eight-year-old
[12:48.720 --> 12:52.040]  daughter but she demanded a woman do it to them because they said we're gonna do
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.440]  it she simple demands not gonna grab them think about this she was at the same
[12:57.440 --> 13:01.480]  airport a month ago that kicked off it was the straw that broke the camels back
[13:01.480 --> 13:04.560]  on this whole TSA revolt that even the New York Times admits is the biggest
[13:04.560 --> 13:12.640]  story of the year so far supernova big important the people rebelling and my
[13:12.640 --> 13:18.120]  guys last Wednesday flew back to Austin from Denver all of the scanners were
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.680]  shut down no pat downs they weren't even hardly wanting anybody a few people they
[13:22.680 --> 13:27.400]  did it was like going back you know six seven eight years ago racing through the
[13:27.400 --> 13:34.800]  lines no lines now if the terror threat is so big at the airports it is a
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.160]  serious crime that they're saying they got to stick their hands down grandma's
[13:38.160 --> 13:42.680]  pants got to put you in a radiation bather because al Qaeda is gonna hit
[13:42.680 --> 13:46.840]  and there's zero tolerance and everybody's got to go through it being
[13:46.840 --> 13:51.520]  trained to be slaves and then so that we don't have a chance to stand up and say
[13:51.520 --> 13:54.360]  no and show the power of the American people they don't want to give us a
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.480]  victory like George Washington at Trenton that first victory they don't
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.240]  want us to realize the power we have so like Sun Sue's Art of War they were
[14:03.240 --> 14:07.480]  gonna lose so they were treated and then ran the hoax and the TSA website
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.320]  laughed at people and said there were no protest no one stood up everybody loves
[14:12.320 --> 14:16.040]  it and they posted a photo of little girls saying thank you for keeping us
[14:16.040 --> 14:24.720]  safe to the TSA a total criminal fraudulent lying hoax the TSA stood down
[14:24.720 --> 14:28.960]  they say there's an imminent threat going on right now to blow up airplanes
[14:28.960 --> 14:32.080]  and they've got to do this and they stood down and they stood down on
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.120]  Thanksgiving and the day after and right through the weekend and now they
[14:35.120 --> 14:39.680]  brought them back up Monday and are even molesting you know one of the
[14:39.680 --> 14:46.800]  singers of the black-eyed peas you name it so they're back and that's what a
[14:46.800 --> 14:50.200]  criminal does they rob your house when you're not there they rob your house
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.520]  when you're not ready well see see see they they back off so we can't stand up
[14:54.520 --> 14:58.240]  against them so we can't find them like Charlie in Vietnam they run into the
[14:58.240 --> 15:01.880]  bushes and then as soon as we go back to our business they come out and start
[15:01.880 --> 15:07.640]  tyrannizing us now I'm gonna get to the biggest news after man cow leaves us at
[15:07.640 --> 15:12.960]  the bottom of the hour man cow Muller Eric Muller big syndicated host on talk
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.160]  radio networks W ABC New York you name it I go on his show every Wednesday and I
[15:19.160 --> 15:21.920]  wanted to invite him on here today because I heard him telling the exact
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.480]  same story he flew with his two daughters and his wife on opt-out day out of
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.880]  Chicago he flew to the Macy's parade he wanted to be part of it and he flew four
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.160]  times through airports with scanners it was all turned off this is confirmed
[15:35.160 --> 15:40.920]  then coming up Bob Barr has got a four-year request there's this leaked DHS
[15:40.920 --> 15:45.280]  memo that drudge report prison planet Alex Jones Matt drudge are being listed
[15:45.280 --> 15:48.760]  as domestic extremist and being surveilled Bob Barr is on the case

[16:20.800 --> 16:24.200]  what we've done here these are people that you know they couldn't be cops they

[16:28.000 --> 16:32.800]  smiling happy kids saying molest me on the TSA website I'm reminded of what I

[17:08.760 --> 17:12.720]  awful they turned off the machine the fixes in and I'm curious about the
[17:12.720 --> 17:18.560]  way they're treating people like like we're all terrorists you also went on
[17:18.560 --> 17:22.840]  Fox News and told your story and countless other reporters have
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.280]  documented it including people in my office yeah and I am aware of that and
[17:27.280 --> 17:33.400]  of course immediately the reporter oh oh well I mean everyone else and I'm
[17:33.400 --> 17:37.440]  live on TV in New York Alex they saw me with my cute little fighter girls they
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.120]  weren't expecting me to say anything I got a good looking family oh but
[17:41.120 --> 17:46.480]  everyone else says it's fine no folks it's not fine it's the Fourth Amendment
[17:46.480 --> 17:52.400]  women are being molested kids are having their photos taken naked
[17:52.400 --> 17:56.080]  pedophiles are doing this this is creepy this is wrong this is the Fourth
[17:56.080 --> 18:00.480]  Amendment but but no one else has said anything yeah that's because they turn
[18:00.480 --> 18:04.960]  off the machines and I hit look Alex I fly every weekend you fly all the time
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.400]  as well to do your investigative journalism I haven't seen you say six or
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.440]  seven years ago I was getting like this I fly every weekend this is
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.040]  Thanksgiving I went to the airport ready for a fight I had my cell phone on
[18:18.040 --> 18:21.960]  everybody you know I was recording everybody go right through go right
[18:21.960 --> 18:26.000]  through go right through and then they say no no protest there was nothing to
[18:26.000 --> 18:32.680]  protest it's a giant hoax but if they say Al Qaeda is about to kill us any
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.680]  minute then haven't they then enabled this now I mean basically I guess they're
[18:37.680 --> 18:41.200]  working for Al Qaeda I mean if the threat is so imminent they just
[18:41.200 --> 18:44.960]  completely stood down for political reasons then I guess they're terrorist
[18:44.960 --> 18:49.360]  well look they this has never been this has never been about Al Qaeda this has
[18:49.360 --> 18:52.480]  always been about you and I in our comfort zone and they're going to be
[18:52.480 --> 18:55.600]  doing this pulling us out of our cars doing this a week earlier I had my
[18:55.600 --> 19:00.880]  cheeks spread and my junk got groped and it felt like a full-on homosexual
[19:00.880 --> 19:04.400]  molestation session at the airport and then the guy says hey have a nice
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.400]  flight like I'm supposed to smile at him the radiation going through our bodies
[19:08.400 --> 19:12.360]  is dangerous with these x-ray machines and I also love how they don't change

[19:18.000 --> 19:22.920]  thugs yeah they've got gloves to protect them but they've felt up 20 people
[19:22.920 --> 19:27.360]  before they change them they're gonna put that that flesh-eating bacteria those
[19:27.360 --> 19:31.840]  crabs on you that's right that's right it's okay that we have crabs and you
[19:31.840 --> 19:34.640]  have to you have to wonder when you go to get an x-ray at the airport right or
[19:34.640 --> 19:37.320]  you go to get an x-ray at your dentist they run out of the room and put on a
[19:37.320 --> 19:43.040]  big lead mask get these belts these government pit bulls they sit there by
[19:43.040 --> 19:47.440]  these x-ray machines all day you know I just I wonder are they fit in the herd
[19:47.440 --> 19:51.040]  what what is their game here and the game is tyranny and the game is they
[19:51.040 --> 19:54.680]  want more power Eric Muller stay there man cow is our guest we're gonna come
[19:54.680 --> 19:57.680]  back and get his ideas on where this should go and what do you think some
[19:57.680 --> 20:02.360]  drudging iron listed I guess is terrorist what is the number one secret to
[20:02.360 --> 20:06.160]  all your health problems I'll give you a hint Dr. Alexis Carroll kept chicken
[20:06.160 --> 20:09.760]  heart tissue alive for 28 years in a test tube he said the cells remain
[20:09.760 --> 20:13.440]  youthful so long as the metabolic waste were washed away but when waste were
[20:13.440 --> 20:17.400]  allowed to accumulate in and around the cell the cell would age and then die so
[20:17.400 --> 20:21.120]  the key to radiant health is cellular cleanliness and the key to keeping the
[20:21.120 --> 20:25.360]  cells clean of chemicals free radicals and heavy metals that we are bombarded

[24:51.240 --> 24:54.760]  really put ourselves in the headline because this is about
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.000]  the government trying to persecute journalists and go after free speech
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.200]  the other latest article out of prisonplanet.com
[25:02.200 --> 25:07.720]  bob bar investigates tsa stand down on national opt out day
[25:07.720 --> 25:11.160]  that's the big crime by these scallywags
[25:11.160 --> 25:16.200]  eric mancal moeller syndicated talk show host who travels a lot for television
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.040]  you name it gets the routine groping you saw the stand down for those that just
[25:20.040 --> 25:23.400]  joined us on that national opt out day that's now been confirmed my office
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.480]  witnessed it in denver you saw it in chicago and new york and other places
[25:27.480 --> 25:30.760]  you flew that have the scanners total stand down
[25:30.760 --> 25:34.920]  do you think this is as dangerous as as i think it is or what are your thoughts
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.680]  about it now coming out that there are tsa memos out
[25:38.680 --> 25:42.760]  calling us domestic extremists and specifically now there's four year
[25:42.760 --> 25:46.360]  investigations by bob bar and his group into
[25:46.360 --> 25:49.960]  matt drudge being spied on alex jones drudgereport.com
[25:49.960 --> 25:54.040]  i mean this sounds like the soviet union let me let me say this uh... as you
[25:54.040 --> 25:57.560]  talk about drudge and your site which is excellent alex
[25:57.560 --> 26:00.760]  uh... the one you're missing which i think is one of the most powerful sites
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.560]  now is breitbart.com uh... breitbart is to the obama
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.560]  years i believe what drudge was to the clinton years in america but
[26:09.560 --> 26:12.920]  you know alex i don't think there's ever been anything
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.480]  that the government has done that has made me angrier
[26:17.480 --> 26:21.560]  and i i love these people the mainstream media look
[26:21.560 --> 26:25.160]  nobody's reading the new york times nobody's reading these newspapers
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.400]  abc cbs nbc people aren't watching
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.120]  and they're blaming the new media but it's not the new media what it is
[26:34.120 --> 26:38.440]  look americans didn't suddenly decide we hate american cars
[26:38.440 --> 26:42.280]  the japanese built them better we didn't suddenly wake up and
[26:42.280 --> 26:45.800]  and then say oh we're not gonna watch tbs anymore no
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.200]  uh... we realize that they have veered into the world of propaganda
[26:50.200 --> 26:55.480]  it's it's it's junk we didn't give up our horses because we didn't like horses
[26:55.480 --> 27:00.120]  cars were better and man cow will tell it like it is so
[27:00.120 --> 27:03.480]  you get high ratings man cow dot com gets millions of visitors
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.400]  they can't compete with the truth but but the the point that i wanted to make
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.560]  is see this this uh... these newspapers are going to go for bailout money
[27:11.560 --> 27:13.960]  they're gonna you understand they're going to go to this is why they're not
[27:13.960 --> 27:18.520]  that was announced last year that exactly so so they're not reporting this
[27:18.520 --> 27:21.560]  this is a huge story if we lose the fourth amendment
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.160]  if we allow them to do this i also wonder it's amazing to me because
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.680]  occasionally you know if there's a justin beaver story or
[27:28.680 --> 27:31.720]  something i'll go online and need a few seconds of a song
[27:31.720 --> 27:34.920]  for my radio show i'm not going to go by a justin beaver cd
[27:34.920 --> 27:38.200]  or whatever it is you know the black i'd be as you mentioned earlier they can
[27:38.200 --> 27:42.200]  shut those sites down instantly but isn't it amazing how helpless we
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.760]  we are against wiki leaks we can't do anything about wiki leaks
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.200]  uh... and i i have wondered you and i talked about this earlier today alex
[27:50.200 --> 27:54.200]  if this isn't uh... to make hillary clinton look awful
[27:54.200 --> 27:57.880]  notice how obama really hasn't reacted about wiki leaks
[27:57.880 --> 28:01.000]  uh... and he's thrown hillary under the bus you really have to wonder if this
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.400]  isn't to destroy hillary clinton to guarantee that obla obla
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.720]  goes unchallenged no listen listen your gut is right i talked to nsa sources
[28:09.720 --> 28:12.920]  like lane madson six months ago and he said
[28:12.920 --> 28:16.840]  this guy's a useful idiot he's being handled by george soros he gave the
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.000]  connections he's up there on the hill i got it from other sources he said watch
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.800]  they're going to release even more on the state department
[28:23.800 --> 28:28.440]  and they're going to release stuff on banks that aren't allied with soros
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.000]  to try to cause a world meltdown so this inner group of central bankers
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.840]  can take over and then it can be blamed on wiki leaks and now
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.120]  six months later it's all coming true
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.320]  try to try to download a beetle song illegally and see how quick they can
[28:43.320 --> 28:46.280]  catch you uh... and yet wiki leaks they can't do anything
[28:46.280 --> 28:48.680]  about it as i said you know it's like that that character from
[28:48.680 --> 28:51.480]  gone to the wind i don't know nothing about personal babies
[28:51.480 --> 28:55.560]  they don't have they don't know they can't stop wiki leaks give me a break
[28:55.560 --> 29:00.760]  this is a setup and uh... look the media is not reporting the big story
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.520]  which is yeah complete molestation of the citizens
[29:04.520 --> 29:07.640]  photographs of us naked our children being molested
[29:07.640 --> 29:11.320]  these are government thought this is this is the private army
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.520]  that our president you know barry when he was running for president this is what
[29:14.520 --> 29:18.440]  he talked about he wanted a private army this is part of the private army
[29:18.440 --> 29:21.400]  army and he said we need a domestic security force
[29:21.400 --> 29:28.200]  just as big just as strong as the u.s military in america in fact let's pull
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.720]  up that quote you can just youtube it's in the computer obama calls for
[29:31.720 --> 29:36.360]  domestic uh... military force and he just stay there stay there stay there
[29:36.360 --> 29:38.840]  man cal i do ten more minutes with us because i want to
[29:38.840 --> 29:42.120]  get your view on where all this is going and talk about
[29:42.120 --> 29:46.520]  uh... just the brazen activities of the tsa but more on wiki leaks

[36:21.800 --> 36:25.240]  body uh none because it builds up and they admit these
[36:25.240 --> 36:29.160]  things have 50 times what they previously claimed that's right no
[36:29.160 --> 36:31.720]  radiation is good for the human structure
[36:31.720 --> 36:34.920]  i've got five-year-old daughters i had to fly
[36:34.920 --> 36:38.600]  through four different uh checkpoints over a weekend
[36:38.600 --> 36:42.360]  and i'm not going to let them get four full body x-rays
[36:42.360 --> 36:45.880]  in a weekend i mean this is this is madness
[36:45.880 --> 36:49.080]  and and so you know and they're not going to take naked pictures of my
[36:49.080 --> 36:51.480]  children and they're not going to fondle them
[36:51.480 --> 36:54.600]  under the guise of uh well we have to find the terrorists
[36:54.600 --> 36:58.600]  we know who the terrorists are let's start profiling these maniacs
[36:58.600 --> 37:01.640]  okay i'm sorry if your god is telling you to uh
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.000]  strap bombs on your children or strap a bomb on yourself you're not praying to
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.960]  god okay uh and these we need to profile just
[37:09.960 --> 37:14.600]  as they do but man count to be specific i mean it came out on fox news and amour
[37:14.600 --> 37:18.360]  al-alaki the number one guy under ben laden is hanging out secretly at the
[37:18.360 --> 37:21.640]  pentagon with the secretary of the army two months after 9 11 when he's on the
[37:21.640 --> 37:25.480]  most wanted list it turns out in every case the fbi is
[37:25.480 --> 37:29.240]  protecting and enabling uh this latest nut ball
[37:29.240 --> 37:33.480]  out in oregon wanting to blow up the christmas tree the guy out at ford hood
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.880]  he was being handled by alaki the underwear bomber was helped on the plane
[37:37.880 --> 37:41.560]  by the u.s state department this is confirmed they're using
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.280]  this threat and enabling this threat as the homeland security reports admitted
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.320]  last year to go after we the people well alex listen i have traveled the world
[37:51.320 --> 37:55.880]  i've been to syria been into jordan uh look there there are a group of people
[37:55.880 --> 37:59.400]  on the planet that want us dead and uh it's not all of them
[37:59.400 --> 38:02.920]  but they're muslims they're islamo fascists they do exist
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.280]  however uh look governments have always created fear or let fear happen or let
[38:08.280 --> 38:12.200]  bad things happen so that we will give up our freedoms do i think that our
[38:12.200 --> 38:15.800]  government look you talk about this guy hanging out the airport who
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.720]  who were the men in suits that allowed the underwear bomber i mean let's wait
[38:19.720 --> 38:22.840]  wait wait that don't don't cut me off alex let let me go through this
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.280]  because i'm pieces together in my head let me go through this can i go ahead
[38:26.280 --> 38:30.520]  okay so men in suits show up and let the underwear not the underwear bomber that
[38:30.520 --> 38:33.160]  was at the shoe bomber the underwear bomber it was both of them it was both
[38:33.160 --> 38:37.560]  of them and they were both run by a locky right he has he has no id but they
[38:37.560 --> 38:42.280]  insist white men in suits insisted he get on the plane
[38:42.280 --> 38:46.520]  the head of homeland security turd off is in charge of these x-ray machines
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.400]  and because of the underwear bomber from last christmas in the shoe
[38:51.400 --> 38:57.000]  now a year later we need x-ray machines and turd off making money on them
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.400]  i mean this is a scam and then the head of the visa scam and then the head of the
[39:01.400 --> 39:05.800]  visa department got in trouble that the undersecretary of uh state
[39:05.800 --> 39:09.720]  mr kennedy and said look i was ordered by an unnamed us agency i'm not going to
[39:09.720 --> 39:14.680]  say this was associated press to help him get on the plane
[39:14.680 --> 39:19.880]  yeah wow you know and and look folks uh the democrats like
[39:19.880 --> 39:23.880]  blame the republicans the republicans like blame the democrats and i want to
[39:23.880 --> 39:26.680]  tell you i've i've been behind the scenes of all of these people
[39:26.680 --> 39:30.200]  they're all in on it you saw the head republican painter walk around the
[39:30.200 --> 39:33.400]  checkpoint uh you know they don't have to go through
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.000]  the tsa these people don't have to have health care
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.600]  so i really would like some of these people i thought huckabee had a good
[39:40.600 --> 39:44.840]  line the other day on fox which is obama and his family should should submit to
[39:44.840 --> 39:47.800]  this to see what the american people are going through of course they don't have
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.320]  to go through any of this but this is for us this is for the sheeple this is for
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.280]  the lemmings this is for the slay obama is going to be on private jets and i'm
[39:56.280 --> 40:00.680]  going to die a lion i'm going to fight well look we're winning this thing and
[40:00.680 --> 40:04.760]  as long as we realize we won the battle we've got to continue to win the next
[40:04.760 --> 40:08.840]  battle in the next and the next it's whoever wants it most and the tsa is
[40:08.840 --> 40:11.880]  already starting to back down no doubt they're going to stage some new event
[40:11.880 --> 40:16.840]  or help some new drugged out lunatic uh like a shoe bomber on a plane who
[40:16.840 --> 40:20.440]  thought you light plastic explosive which you can't do
[40:20.440 --> 40:23.800]  no detonators they are finding mentally ill
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.240]  nut balls and opening the door for them
[40:27.240 --> 40:30.680]  and protecting them and that's the bottom line i'm not denying
[40:30.680 --> 40:35.320]  eric that there aren't some uh you know islamic radicals out there that that
[40:35.320 --> 40:39.560]  you know that do want to wage war all i'm saying is in every case i research
[40:39.560 --> 40:43.320]  and look at it's always private corporations or big government
[40:43.320 --> 40:48.840]  opening the door protecting uh handling funding these people because we're
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.320]  the real target of this new world order uh i really
[40:53.320 --> 40:56.520]  appreciate you coming on with this finishing up with wiki leaks though
[40:56.520 --> 40:59.160]  uh and and shifting gears into that before i get back into these latest
[40:59.160 --> 41:02.520]  developments on tsa and it's huge folks uh with homeland security now
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.640]  persecuting uh and investigating as terrorist
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.720]  an extremist anybody that's criticizing them again you don't like naked body
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.280]  scanners we're going to fondle you uh and oh you want to write news articles
[41:14.280 --> 41:18.040]  about us uh that we're hiring criminals and molesters
[41:18.040 --> 41:21.800]  we're going to put you on a terror list more intimidation more bullying but
[41:21.800 --> 41:25.560]  getting back into wiki leaks you look at how this pushes the world
[41:25.560 --> 41:28.600]  closer to war you look at how it destabilizes pakistan
[41:28.600 --> 41:31.720]  that shows they're secretly working with the us behind the scenes
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.960]  uh you notice how it emboldens uh uh certain central banks to shut down
[41:37.960 --> 41:41.560]  other banks and now asanj has announced he's going to be going after select
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.240]  corporations exactly what my government and nsa sources
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.800]  told me was coming next from asanj and i agree with you we know hillary she's
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.600]  horrible but was about to run against obama the sorrows crowd put obama in
[41:54.600 --> 41:59.000]  they don't want that and so i agree with you the way the media spun this they're
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.520]  going after hillary clinton uh where do you see this going now with interpol
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.000]  issuing an arrest warrant for asanj well i mean you know look they're saying
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.680]  he's a rapist and a molester uh some of what i've read hints that uh you know
[42:12.680 --> 42:17.080]  dr evil himself sorrows is the man that's funding wiki leaks
[42:17.080 --> 42:21.000]  where does this guy get all of his money uh and and again i just want to say to
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.640]  your listeners alex obama and our entire
[42:25.640 --> 42:29.720]  hennigan and our white house everybody's come out and said well what can we do about wiki leaks
[42:29.720 --> 42:34.600]  and yet i know because i'm always looking for a different sound for my radio
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.600]  show and i'm sure you do too download a beatle song and see how long they can
[42:38.600 --> 42:41.720]  put it put up a web here you go folks put up a website where you're giving away
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.000]  beatle's music uh find out how long it takes for them to
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.640]  shut you down i mean this is a joke so so you have to you have to ask yourself
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.000]  why would our government let wiki leaks continue
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.200]  and why hasn't obama come out strongly against it
[42:56.200 --> 43:00.600]  and look at who it who would uh who it really slams it slams hillary clinton
[43:00.600 --> 43:03.720]  no monica crowley a friend of mine she was nixon's assistant
[43:03.720 --> 43:06.440]  she's written some great books she's a brilliant woman
[43:06.440 --> 43:09.080]  she came out and had some inside information that hillary was going to
[43:09.080 --> 43:12.520]  quit the state department and then in several months announced that she was
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.920]  going to run for the presidency obama and his camp has been very
[43:16.920 --> 43:21.800]  deft remember remember just two years ago how unbeatable the clinton machine
[43:21.800 --> 43:25.000]  was oh we've even had the washington post two weeks ago
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.560]  tell obama to step down and have another democrat run because they know
[43:29.560 --> 43:34.280]  uh he literally is is is taken out the garbage nobody wants him he is a
[43:34.280 --> 43:38.360]  political dead duck so now everybody's saying boy well i
[43:38.360 --> 43:42.360]  guess hillary would be better than obla blah so look they're they're letting
[43:42.360 --> 43:45.160]  this i mean this is just my theory but they're letting this information come
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.960]  out it looks horrible for hillary the head of wiki leaks funded by george
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.920]  soros and you know obama's the one to him obama's the you know the antichrist
[43:54.920 --> 43:58.040]  that soros worships so they're gonna take out hillary
[43:58.040 --> 44:01.480]  and forget this this idea that hillary is close to obama
[44:01.480 --> 44:05.400]  this is the old case of keeping your enemies closer no no i'm gonna stop you
[44:05.400 --> 44:09.800]  i was there man cal destroy her man cal hold on i want you to say that but i
[44:09.800 --> 44:12.680]  got to put this in here now it's in the obama deception
[44:12.680 --> 44:17.080]  you're welcome it's like 15 minutes into it uh to play it on your show
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.120]  whenever you'd like you're welcome to play a few minutes of it
[44:20.120 --> 44:24.760]  while remember when when hillary and obama were neck and neck
[44:24.760 --> 44:27.880]  and she started to pull ahead of him for a few days then they were going to have
[44:27.880 --> 44:31.480]  a secret meeting in georgetown outside dc or n dc
[44:31.480 --> 44:35.400]  and then the media for two days ran around looking for him in dc
[44:35.400 --> 44:39.800]  they put all of the press corps for obama on a plane said he was coming this is
[44:39.800 --> 44:45.480]  on cbs news and on cnn locked the door and kidnapped him shanghite him
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.200]  literally conked him on the head figuratively and took him to chicago

[54:26.840 --> 54:30.760]  i just want to expose the tyrants and save free speech on this country
[54:30.760 --> 54:36.280]  are we going to allow homeland security to spy on and list people as domestic
[54:36.280 --> 54:39.880]  extremist if if they say no to having hands stuck down
[54:39.880 --> 54:44.120]  their pants and if they report on that or they say no about being radiated or
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.800]  they point out how tsa's hiring rapist and molesters and
[54:47.800 --> 54:52.360]  stalkers and control freak criminals and and saying it doesn't bar them from

[55:19.560 --> 55:23.160]  for a while so i don't know if yesterday's terms they were shut down
[55:23.160 --> 55:26.760]  will be allowed through today but let's go completely hog wild haven't done this

[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:23.560]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.560]  we're going to be discussing coming up in the next hour the nature of the
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.080]  control grid how we've been domesticated from the
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.080]  natural true state of human beings into this control grid how it's been
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.000]  scientifically engineered we're being farmed
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.360]  there's so many great political researchers and minds out there and i
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:46.120]  just discovered a fellow who's very well known it seems but i wasn't aware of
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.240]  so a big body of work he'll be joining us tell you about that special guest
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.360]  coming up at the start of the next segment
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.000]  but the situation with the tsa is only getting bigger it's not going away
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.320]  mother kept in glass cage for almost an hour by tsa for
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:06.280]  resistant for resisting over breast milk they wanted to x-ray her breast milk
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:12.040]  which admittedly damages the quality uh and she read to them the tsa guidelines
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:14.360]  and they said we don't care so for close to an hour
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.400]  they locked her up in a glass cage and yelled at her
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.880]  it's all but part of humiliation like having uh a dunce hat put on you or
[01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.480]  made to go in the corner it's all basic child psychology
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.680]  they admit this they admit that they're feeling you up and
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:31.560]  squeezing you hard to make you go through the scanners
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.160]  and they admit that they're training a cadre a domestic army for the streets
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.600]  of america it's all admitted
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.200]  this is such a key issue as i said over a month ago and people didn't get it
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.640]  we were driving it beating the war drum for liberty
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.920]  and driving the story out into the mainstream
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.120]  that's why google is banning us and shutting us down and
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:57.240]  trying to keep us out of the news feeds now let me read to this article
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.040]  watch dog probes dsh spying department of homeland security spying on drudge
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.600]  over tsa report that let me cover that after the break let me get to this first
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:11.400]  because it all integrates together bob bar investigates tsa stand down on not
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.480]  national opt-out day again bob bar investigates tsa stand
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.600]  down on national opt-out day get this out to everyone we're
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:23.080]  going to bring these crooks to justice we've got them
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:27.080]  body scanners out of use invasive pat downs curtailed
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.480]  in political ploy as tsa mox critics on their own blog
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.080]  exposing fact that security is nothing more than theater
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.880]  these are bullies training us to be dominated a civil liberties watch dog
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.200]  group has filed a freedom of information act
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.040]  request in an attempt to shed more light on the tsa's efforts to disrupt a day
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.800]  of protest aimed at full body scanners and invasive
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.120]  pat downs by largely curtailing their use for one day
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.560]  only last week it was actually three or four days from my research
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:01.560]  the foi request also seeks to determine whether the tsa
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.960]  regards the leaders of the protest movements as domestic extremists
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.800]  following the leak of a tsa memo indicating it to be the case
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.840]  in a major publication we've got linked in canada
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.840]  from their source the non-partisan non-profit organization liberty guard
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.120]  led by former congressman bob bar is demanding
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.880]  internal tsa directives and communications pertaining to the opt-out
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.480]  grassroots protest day that took place on november 24th
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:30.440]  and if they try to not release it and claim its anti-terror then i guess
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:34.360]  they're saying we're terrorist while it was expected that the protest on the
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.200]  eve of thanksgiving would be widespread causing delays and extensive
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.720]  uh cues at airports and security lines
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.840]  in reality the majority of travelers experience no problems
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.520]  because they shut it down everywhere the tsa and the corporate media immediately
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:52.040]  implied that this was proof positive that the public were not concerned about
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.400]  the new tsa procedure just move along nothing to see here
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.120]  and that contrary to numerous opinion polls the majority
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.760]  supported the rape downs and body scans the tsa even mockingly suggested that
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.240]  quote on their own website what some protesters threatened as an opt-out day
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.120]  turned into a tsa appreciation day however it soon became apparent that the
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.520]  reason there was so little protesting taking place
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.040]  was because the tsa had roped off most if not all
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.480]  of its naked body scanners and apparently instructed its agents
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.920]  to tone down the level and severity of the rape downs
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.760]  the new jersey star ledger subsequently reported that the majority of new
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.960]  york's full body scanners my guys flew through denver none of them were on
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.400]  was idle throughout much of the day depriving most passengers of the chance
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:42.680]  to opt out of the controversial screening procedure even if they had wanted to
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.400]  at the nation's busiest airports at lana heartfield there was quote limited of
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.760]  any use of the controversial full body scanners the lana journal constitution
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.800]  reported all right i'm going to shift gears to the really big news
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.560]  in detail coming up after this break i mean now they're sending the secret
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.680]  police after us folks we got to stand up against this
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.880]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:07.880]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.320]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.200]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:21.720]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.320]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:29.240]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.760]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.880]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.920]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:22.120]  so think about this in america
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:28.600]  in our country the tsa tells you there are vicious terrorists that want to kill
[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.680]  you any minute and every time we look at the shoe bomber the
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.720]  underwear bomber you name it it's run by and we're all a locky
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.800]  admitted pentagon being protected total front guy
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.880]  state department helping getting them on the plane with the underwear bomber
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.400]  british government helping get the idiot shoe bomber on the plane didn't have a
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.240]  detonator for the plastic explosives tried to light it out of his gourd looks
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:56.040]  like a crazy homeless person the same story over and over and
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.920]  over and over again and then they're telling you it's
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:02.120]  such a big threat they know you're going to protest and stand up
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.240]  with civil disobedience they don't want to give you a chance
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.000]  to show your power they understand psychology and so they just
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.280]  shut it down get rid of the scanners rope them off
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.440]  no pat downs boom you're through and they knew the opt-outers
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.880]  we're going to be flying back the day after thanksgiving friday and saturday
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.560]  and so our intel and it's also in a lot of news articles they've confirmed
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.600]  that they weren't doing it the day before thanksgiving
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.040]  thanksgiving friday or saturday some airports started
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:37.560]  phasing it back in sunday they all had it back by monday two days ago
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:42.120]  it's all not just security theater you think they want to do this to make you
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.640]  feel safe they could care less 300 plus thousand die from bad drug
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.680]  interactions over 200 000 die from botched surgeries
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.800]  and flesh eating bacteria every year in our hospitals
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.520]  uh you know thousands and thousands die uh from allergic responses to food
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.400]  we looked up the numbers over a hundred die a year
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.920]  from bee stings several hundred from waff stings do we have little
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.760]  little people running around in blue suits to feel like protect us in body
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:10.200]  armor from bees oh bees kill over a hundred we've
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.360]  got to stop it we've got to keep you safe it's all just terrorist
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:18.520]  boogie man it's it's it's similar to statistically
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:23.640]  what is it maybe two people die a year on the coastlines of the united states
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.760]  from shark attacks guys in fact search the numbers
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.840]  yearly shark attack deaths worldwide i believe it on average is 14
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.360]  some years this is highest 20 some it's only five i've pulled them up before
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:43.720]  but the average is 14 pull up uh yearly deaths from shark attack
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.000]  it'll be 12 or 14 i've seen different numbers but
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  everybody i know almost everyone i know when i go to the beach with friends
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.440]  or family they're scared to swim out more than a hundred yards
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:59.400]  because they know tiger sharks and sand tigers get caught off the texas coast
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.040]  i could care less i hope there's one out there i want to see it
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.000]  you know i've been uh snorkeling and scuba diving before in a
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.360]  you know seven foot nurse shark comes up everybody is like swimming towards the
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.560]  boat and fear i'm like swimming towards it wow
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.080]  and of course it runs then oh my gosh something's swimming at me
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.560]  and i'm not some tough guy ladies and gentlemen the chances of a tiger shark
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.800]  or even a great white shark attacking you is incredibly low unless you're
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:31.880]  wearing a black wetsuit and on top of a surfboard that's most the attacks
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.760]  because you look like a big gigantic fat seal a black seal
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.520]  that's why great whites normally grab you bite a leg off and then let you go
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.840]  but people bleed out out in the water and usually die
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.160]  i mean i'm swimming out there in the Caribbean and i see a five foot hammer
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.200]  head down 200 feet i mean i'm going to try to get down as
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.320]  far as i can and look at it and what's the hammer head going to do when it
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.800]  sees something coming towards it it's going to go run
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.800]  you ever seen a dog a big dog runs out from its house and barks at you if you
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.840]  run it's going to attack you but if you stand your ground
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:12.520]  99 percent of dogs are going to run unless they're a trained police attack dog
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:16.920]  which is one out of a thousand blow it up for me uh what's the number of
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.200]  shark deaths every year let's see if my memory's right
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:26.200]  what do they say it is uh that number says five but that was in 2000
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:33.240]  uh from 2000 2007 it was five i've seen the numbers of 12 to 14 per year
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:37.480]  whatever you got six and a half billion people you got billions and billions of
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.040]  people going in the water over and over again
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.080]  and uh what was that source that said five
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:51.560]  it it doesn't matter the point is five 12 14 what's the difference
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.520]  what was the source university of florida okay so the university of florida
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:01.320]  says five a year i've seen 12 and 14 the point is
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.800]  but most adults including some of my family
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.800]  will not i mean
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:16.760]  in the Gulf of mexico i will go out at night uh on a float uh if it's a
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.440]  beautiful starlet night my dad will do it with me when he travels with us to
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.480]  the beach you're not going to catch my mother doing it now there is something
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.320]  you should worry about at night and that's barracuda they get confused and
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.720]  think you're a little fish see a ring or something on your finger in the
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.280]  moonlight there's also more jellyfish at night
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.160]  so if it's jellyfish season you don't want to do it but
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:42.360]  but the issue here uh is it's imaginary and terrorists are the same way
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:48.680]  this turban bearded man this magical creature that wants to kill me
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:52.200]  come on folks it is completely manufactured you're like well what about
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:57.560]  9 11 well that was as phony as a three dollar bill
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.600]  but let's say the real bona fide type of terrorism
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.280]  where some angry palestinian for having their land taken or whatever
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.320]  tries to blow somebody up i mean what's your chance
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.800]  if you're not in the west bank uh you know trying to be engaged in in in in
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.680]  war-torn tourism which some people do you're not going to get killed
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.040]  and and i've seen the statistics in israel you got a better chance at israel
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.560]  of dying in a car wreck than you do being killed by terrorists are people
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.680]  scared driving their cars no so people are scared to death of sharks they're
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.640]  scared to death of men with beards and turbans
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.800]  they're scared to death of things that the media and the mind controllers
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:45.320]  put into you as a unsubstantiated delusional automatic emotional response
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.560]  okay
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:53.080]  because it's got big teeth it's got big scary black eyes
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:58.360]  oh my gosh it looks like a monster so what having your leg bit off by a shark
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.320]  is probably a lot less painful than being thrown out of a car when it rolls
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.680]  over you and what's the chances it's going to
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.760]  bite you it's got to be billions to one
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:14.680]  unless you're wearing a black wetsuit on a big black dark surfboard
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.480]  off the coast of san diego or santa cruz
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.000]  and then it's still got to be one out of a billion i mean what every couple
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.640]  years you hear about somebody off the coast of california getting gobbled by
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.040]  a shark
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:34.600]  now if if people are chumming dumping blood and rotten fish in the water
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.480]  that's why a lot of people that do get attacked off the coast of australia
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.320]  they're out there spear and fish if you got a bag full of four or five fish
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.000]  that are still alive with blood coming out of them from the spear gun
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.880]  and and a big hammerhead or a big tiger shark comes along or a big great white
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.800]  that's 20 feet long comes along and it sees you swimming around down there
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.600]  he can't help it he smells blood it looks delicious
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.120]  he's smelling fish blood he sees you as a big fish that's bleeding
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:05.160]  you're going to get attacked
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.360]  i was reading statistics a few years ago when i was looking into this
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.600]  with stingrays especially the big varieties there's several big species
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.960]  and remember the crocodile hunter who got killed a few years ago when he
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:26.120]  swam up to a giant stingray and got above it and it flipped out and flung
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:31.080]  its stinger up into his heart now that's a case of being killed by
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.360]  shark you know how number one that stingrays in the shark family
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:38.360]  number two stingrays if you statistically look kill many more times
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:43.640]  every year what great white sharks do or sharks all together and you know why
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:50.360]  because they think you're a shark that's a tiger shark that likes to eat them
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.480]  they think you're a tiger shark so you come over to try to grab them they're
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.520]  going to kill you are you scared of a stingray though
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.440]  no because they're not big and scary they don't have big giant teeth
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:04.680]  so a lot of this is our primitive instincts uh being manipulated okay i'm
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.360]  done i apologize i'm ranting here but we've got to
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.920]  make this the number one search term today spying on drudge
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.520]  because the media will pick up on this and learn that there is an
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.360]  investigation by bob bar of dhs spying on drudge
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.960]  myself and others here's the article
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:30.680]  watchdog probes dhs spying on drudge over tsa revolt
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:36.440]  foia request investigates whether critics of the tsa are being listed as
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.360]  domestic extremist a freedom of information act request
[01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.280]  filed by former congressman bob bar seeks to discover
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.960]  whether the department of homeland security has been keeping tabs on the
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.840]  drudge report and other prominent media outlets
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.320]  who have been spearheading a nationwide revolt against invasive tsa
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:00.840]  airport measures the foia request filed by bars legal
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.400]  guard organization pdf linked demands that the transportation
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.000]  security administration and agency of the dhs
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.760]  turn over all information related to matt drudge the drudge report
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.520]  along with other media personalities and websites that have been at the center
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.960]  of the tsa controversy including alex jones
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.040]  john tiner and prisonplanet.com tiners don't touch my junk
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:28.520]  oh he may be an extremist don't grab my genitals
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.240]  oh you're you're an extremist let's get tiner back on this who he thinks about
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.320]  being uh it looks like listed as a terrorist basically
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.120]  domestic extremist he wants they do that they can investigate you
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:45.000]  domestic extremist in reference to a reported tsa memo that was leaked last
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.840]  week which according to doug hagman officially addresses those
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.840]  who were opposed to or engaged in disruption of the implementation of the
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.800]  enhanced airport screening procedures as domestic extremists
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.160]  call watson i want him to add a caveat here they're already threatening 11
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.520]  thousand dollar fines so of course they're listing us as this
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.320]  let's add you know that for further intimidation
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.160]  they're listing uh uh uh 11 000 made up fines as well
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.840]  which then you actually read they can't even do
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.120]  numerous confirmed memos originating out of the federal or state
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.640]  law enforcement agencies such as the infamous myac report have listed
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.640]  conservatives and libertarians as domestic extremists
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.400]  and even potential domestic terrorists for opposing big government
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:31.400]  and supporting constitutionally minded campaigns and causes
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.360]  bar's attempt to discover whether the federal government is
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.800]  treating critics of the tsa as domestic extremists is key
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.720]  in light of tsa chief john pistols announcement yesterday
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.720]  that all travelers flying u.s airspace would be checked against a government
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.240]  watch list before they're given permission to board an aircraft a system
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.520]  some have likened the communist style internal checkpoints
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.440]  you get it they're talking about not letting you fly if you don't let them
[01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.240]  grab your genitals and radiate you we'll be right back stay with us this is key

[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:55.080]  to bob Chapman and he and he's like saying you know what you're probably
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.120]  going to see a little bit of a pullback here this summer
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:02.440]  but that might mean gold will pull back down to 1450 to 1500 dollars
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.480]  amounts because we're going to be coming off of a high that's much greater
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.600]  than that you know i i don't have a crystal ball i don't know for sure where
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.640]  things are going to go but for sure people should be getting into gold and
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:14.760]  silver hands down the best deal we have is the 97
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.880]  dollars for the silver dollars three of your videos
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.160]  but uh you know the Lakota nation silver rounds walking liberty halves at 1284
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.760]  british sovereigns at 369 uh frank's right now at 294
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.040]  we have the creature from juckle island book if you haven't read that yet we put
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:35.400]  a silver dollar there too we're delivering that for 31 bucks
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:39.240]  i mean there's just a lot of things that are going on the bottom line is alex
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.000]  is people that are sitting in u.s currency better take note right now
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.920]  because there's a big trouble heading to us and we've already seen a great
[01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.240]  portion of it and we will see a lot more of it
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.680]  people need to be getting into gold and silver at this time absolutely and at
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.360]  those prices on many of those deals you're actually losing money but you know
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.840]  you want to create relationships with customers
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.680]  so that's why you do it but on a few of those deals i i happen to see the
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.480]  internal you know emails that you send me from the company
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.160]  on frank's and sovereigns that you bought when it went down you're selling it
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.240]  when it's high but at the old price three to four percent markup
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.080]  what business can operate on that ted is incredibly
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:23.880]  uh just incredibly competitive and he has funded jenesis my show
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.400]  genesis is the place mitis is the place uh to financially
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:32.840]  support this is the place to get your golden silver the move
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.560]  to physically hold golden silver uh because we know that the jp morgan
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.680]  and others are are short on it a hundred to one that's even
[01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.520]  you know bloomberg ap we're going to play a video towards the end of the next
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.960]  hour where they actually break all this down uh but
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:51.240]  by physically holding it if millions and millions more people start
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:54.280]  physically holding it there's no way they can suppress it and that's what's
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:58.200]  been happening is india and china and other places the general public even
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.040]  the peasants move to hold silver and gold
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.480]  that's what's exposing the fact that it's been artificially held down
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.240]  uh against these fiat currencies here's the toll free number to call
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.280]  and take advantage of all those specials and more just tell them it's the alex
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:15.800]  jones radio special or you will pay a little more the regular prices are
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.760]  very competitive but these radio specials are exclusive
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:22.040]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.560]  eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.160]  again have you missed that number eight hundred six eight six
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:32.360]  two two three seven ted anderson thank you so much for joining us
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.960]  yeah thanks a lot alex again folks eight hundred six eight six
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.240]  two two three seven last week uh i saw one of this
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:46.120]  guys youtube videos and it turns out he's very well known
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:50.520]  we've got uh an it guy named matt here in the office who's a huge fan
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:55.000]  i'd heard him say a few months ago you ought to get stefan molly new one
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  because he agrees with a lot of your you know same analogies and world views but
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.160]  is very articulate uh and and and puts it in a very polished
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:07.480]  uh but but but also simple way to understand and i kind of listened to him
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.680]  but then wandered on off because we're always bouncing guest ideas around and
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.520]  i saw this youtube video i even forget the name of it what is it jaren i sent it
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:18.120]  to you last week the story of our enslavement
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.640]  that was like 10 minutes long and uh going from memory
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.680]  and it really laid it out you know i've talked about the domestication the
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.240]  prison planet how they train us from birth
[01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.840]  basically imperial slave conditioning to be submissive
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:36.680]  while they trained their top minions to be brutal and hateful and and animalistic
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.600]  we're trained to be submissive and people think oh well that civilization
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:46.280]  that's not civilization that is a hive corporate
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.800]  communal uh collectivist uh borg i mean literally something out of star trek
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.240]  i'm not a trekkie but i've you know i've i've i've seen some of the tv shows with
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.440]  the uh you know with the borg you will be assimilated
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:02.120]  that's what this whole tsa thing's about so he's a canadian philosopher blogger
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.080]  sas author and the host of uh free domain radio
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:11.080]  he's stefan uh malinou he's the author of a whole bunch of different books he's
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:15.000]  written on uh truth the uh tyranny of illusion
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:19.320]  and he's out in phoenix and talk at the 2010 freedom summit
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.760]  and we've got a links up on info wars dot com to his
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:26.760]  website as well so i'm excited to have him for most of this hour
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.040]  or all of this hour and most of the next hour the last 15 minutes or so i'm
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:34.360]  going to blitz through all the other news i haven't gotten to the food safety
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:39.000]  bill that's like the patriot acts the opposite of patriotism and freedom
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.800]  big developments there a lot of other economic news
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.320]  we're going to spend uh about an hour and 15 minutes
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.240]  uh with him uh today and obviously this won't be the last time
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.880]  the stefan malinou uh visits us great to have you on with us sir
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.120]  thanks alex it's great to be here really instead of just playing your youtube
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.560]  video uh i thought i'd just get you on to kind of
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.280]  give you the floor for the rest of this segment then i've got my questions and
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.520]  comments to run through your world view and how you describe
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:12.360]  these globalist farmers uh who are literally farming us
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.080]  as a commodity as a human resource i mean they openly say this about us
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.560]  uh all this huxley wrote about it i mean you're not the first to notice this and
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.120]  won't be the last but you articulately really uh have a deep
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.440]  uh you know peering view beneath the surface so
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:35.160]  so give us your boiled down uh synthesis of this
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.920]  sure i'd be happy to i began to sort of notice this uh i took a graduate degree
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.560]  in history from the university of toronto i began to sort of notice this
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:45.560]  in one day i was looking at in my in my room i was
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:48.680]  looking at a map of the world and it really struck me
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.880]  that while i was thought i was looking at countries that were defined by
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.960]  by cultures and religions and ways of thinking i thought you know what i'm
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:59.960]  really looking at is farm that the boundaries of farms you know like when
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:03.320]  you fly in an airplane you look down you see those checkerboard
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.160]  fields laid out beneath you that that's really what the world is because what
[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.000]  demarks one country from another is the borders
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.760]  of tax ownership and it began to really sort of play with this idea which then
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.400]  bore fruit in this video that we really should be viewed as
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:23.560]  human livestock and it is the most advanced form of human livestock to live
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:26.440]  in a democracy because in the ancient world
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.280]  slaves were directly owned like you own people and they weren't very productive
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:33.400]  because they were so depressed and alienated all the time
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.000]  and then you went through the roman model which was slightly more removed
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.560]  where you owned people but you taxed them a little bit and then you went
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:44.040]  through the feudal model where you didn't own people directly but they
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.760]  had to pay you off in order to work the land
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.160]  but there was this amazing development in the 19th century 18th and the 19th
[01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:54.920]  century where the ruling classes realized that if
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:00.200]  they allowed us to choose our own job then we would be as productive as
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.640]  could be imagined this was really the beginning of the industrial revolution
[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:07.160]  and so that in the same way that a farmer will plant his crops further
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.320]  apart in order to have them be more productive
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:13.000]  and he won't crowd his animals too much together we've been granted a certain
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.280]  amount of economic and political liberties not because
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:20.440]  our rulers have those values in the abstract or as a principle
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.560]  but because it gives us the illusion that we're free which makes us more
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.480]  energetic in the pursuit of our careers and the generation of wealth
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:31.320]  but the problem is that the more economic freedoms you get
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.680]  the greater the productivity of the working classes
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.120]  the greater the growth of the political parasite class
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.800]  it's sort of like if you uh it's sort of like putting a direct blood line into
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:44.600]  a tumor it just makes the tumor grow and grow
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:48.920]  and so what's happening is the smaller the government that you start with
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.640]  the larger the government that you end with and I think that's
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:55.400]  the case with the american experiment which is a noble but tragic experiment
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:58.680]  where they said let's start with the smallest possible government that we
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.800]  could get and I think they did a great job of creating a small government
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.520]  delineating it with the bill of rights and constitution
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.440]  but what happened what has happened is is the amount of economic
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.680]  freedom and productivity that was generated by that liberty
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:17.240]  has created a massive tax base that has swelled the political and parasite
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.520]  classes to the point where what started off as the smallest
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.200]  government in the world has now turned into the very largest government in
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.720]  history and the very largest government that anybody could conceive of
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:30.760]  and that I think is the central tragedy of what has occurred people who fight
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:33.800]  for freedom don't know that they're laying down the ground
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:38.600]  for sowing the seeds for future tyranny and until I think we understand
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:42.360]  the degree to which we are we have an allegiance not
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.360]  to a political leader or even to an ideology but to a tax bomber
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:49.080]  once we understand that we can begin to really work
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.280]  towards a free society but I think until we see that
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.240]  we're just kind of playing games in our cages
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:02.360]  now you're welcome to continue breaking down your view of this paradigm I've
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:06.120]  got quite a few questions and avenues of
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.400]  discussion looking at at what you're talking about from
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.440]  different angles but please continue before I get to my
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.920]  questions well let's let's take it up to the present
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:18.600]  price because I do sort of truth is that if I try to break down
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.120]  the news if you look at what's going on right now
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:25.480]  there's a budget deficit commission that's going on and the results of it
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.720]  were all perfectly predictable the the dependent classes
[01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:32.760]  all right how is it that they turn up against each other right direct human
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:35.800]  ownership is very unprofitable because the moment you start pushing guns in
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:39.160]  people's faces they go limp like intellectually and they're not
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:42.520]  creative they don't be on they won't want to be entrepreneurs and so on
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.520]  and so what you have to do to rule human beings is you have to set them
[01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.600]  against each other and the best way to set human beings against each other
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.280]  if you're a human farmer is to not own them directly but to take from the
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:00.280]  productive classes and create a dependent class and the dependent class
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:03.480]  is rich and poor it's the military industrial complex
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.840]  it's school teachers who are dependent upon the government for their summers
[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:10.600]  off and their job security and their pensions it's welfare people on welfare
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.680]  and so on they're all dependent upon the state and so the moment that people like
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:19.400]  you and I begin to say we're not free the entire paradigm is not free we do
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.640]  not have the liberties we think we do we're only granted
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.680]  certain liberties that we're more productive for others the moment we
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:29.720]  begin to talk about a peaceful nonviolent non-coercive solution to
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.000]  social problems rather than hurting people around and pointing guns at them
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.640]  and selling off the unborn to anyone that they can find in order to fund
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.880]  the bribery of the voters in the present the moment we start talking about that
[01:47:41.880 --> 01:47:45.720]  the dependent class is not to attack it right and you can see that
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.400]  very clearly Ron Paul it happens it's just about anybody
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:52.840]  who raises their voice and a cry of freedom in this land that we get attacked
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:55.320]  by the people who are dependent upon the state
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.640]  and the real tragedy i believe is that the only people who really care about
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.520]  the poor the only people who really care about education
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.760]  are people who are striking at the root of the violence of a state and system
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:09.960]  because as we can see right now this budget deficit commission completely
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.960]  predictable what happens is the ruling classes take care of
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.160]  their own and they only create a dependent class to
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:20.040]  maintain their hold over everyone and to make sure that the group of people
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.520]  who are going to attack anyone who talks about freedom
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.200]  so when they're talking about deficit reduction deficit cutting do they talk
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:29.800]  about repudiating the debt to foreign governments and international bankers
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.680]  of course not because that's the class they're designed to protect
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:37.240]  what happens is the dependent classes are shown to be completely
[01:48:37.240 --> 01:48:40.920]  spent so they're going to cut welfare they're going to cut medicare they're
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.400]  going to cut medicare they're going to cut social security to the point where
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:46.440]  people are going to go through extreme and extraordinary
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.040]  and then they're going to use those people that have been displaced as a
[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:54.920]  political weapon saying if you want to get the welfare checks
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.400]  and the walmart goodies back again you've got to politically go for even a
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:02.680]  bigger government to rob what's left of the middle class
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.800]  which the ruling elite from my view has decided
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.120]  to basically clamp down on that no that's right and and what happens is
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.880]  the the fruit of violence are always disastrous
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.560]  always disastrous so what happens of course is that freedom gets blamed
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.240]  for it right so for some reason people think that the recent
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:25.080]  great recession at the housing bubble the tax bubble of the savings alone to the
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:29.800]  80s that all of that resulted from some sort of free market enterprise as if
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:33.160]  the government didn't run the entire currency as if the government didn't
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:36.600]  have you know millions of regulations and massive amounts of taxation and
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:39.560]  hurting people around the gunpoint all over the place and throwing millions of
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.240]  people in jail that is not a free society and so all of the
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.080]  disastrous that accrued the violence the government had the handy scapegoat in the
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:51.480]  name of freedom and that of course is the real tragedy people are somehow blaming
[01:49:51.480 --> 01:49:54.440]  voluntary peaceful human interactions for all of these massive
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:58.680]  disasters as if you and i could run up at 13 trillion dollar debt on our own i
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:02.520]  mean it's just astounding but the dependent classes are going to get
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:07.080]  really badly treated in this next round and uh it is going to be used as
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:11.000]  an excuse to attempt to extend the power and control because
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.840]  the disease is masquerading as it sounds pure
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.800]  well i agree with you uh stefan malinu is our guest we're going to come back
[01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:23.960]  from break and i'm going to go through some notes that i've written about
[01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:28.920]  uh the basic thesis that he just put out that i completely agree with because
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.600]  and the globalists themselves have basically described it in very similar
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.440]  terms and where stefan's talking about how he
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:41.240]  just noticed this himself and and and i've had that happen to me so so many
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.240]  times i will notice something and think about it and then later read globalist
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.240]  publications where they are saying exactly what i thought but
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.800]  then from their farming perspective so it's just
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.760]  incredible how obvious all of this is and it's
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:51:01.240]  hidden in plain view we'll be right back stay with us
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.680]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:08.120]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:11.880]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:14.680]  than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.960]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.840]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:23.960]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds

[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:15.000]  coming up to about 20 30 minutes we'll open the phones up
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.520]  a lot of other key news coming up but going through his
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.240]  analogy which isn't really even an analogy it's how the world works
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.720]  of countries being farms being plantations
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.720]  since we broke up from being just small bands tribal bands
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:36.360]  where people pretty much just elected uh who their chief would be because they
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:39.560]  could hunt the best and lead the best and then it moved into the witch
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.560]  doctors and a lot of con artistry and things that grew from there into the
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:48.040]  control grid that we see today i want to throw these points out at
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.520]  stephan the issue is if you go back to the
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.280]  renaissance there was a major resistance against tyranny
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:57.880]  and the system saw that where people had actually
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:03.960]  broken through and forced freedom that it created prosperity so they said wait
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:07.240]  a minute we're at war with the french or we're at war with the english or we're
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.120]  at war with the dutch or the spanish if we allow more
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.160]  freedom in our country more industry will come here
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:19.080]  more people will immigrate here who are developing new sciences and and
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:23.000]  manufacturing things so it was a competition but now the decision has
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.280]  openly been made to establish world government openly
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.320]  to establish world government you know run by these robber baron elite
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.080]  families who don't want to free market so that no one can run
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:40.600]  state to state nation to nation so there's no competition
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.200]  between the farms and so everything can basically be run
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.480]  like north korea and that decision has been made
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.640]  because the the elites openly say the future doesn't need us
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.560]  people aren't just cheap they're valueless to the globalist now
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.200]  they want to phase out and get rid of at least
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:02.200]  80 percent of us they have the robotics they have the life extension
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  uh... they don't want to share the world in the future with us
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.560]  they have pure disdain for us especially the
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:13.800]  uh... hog like uh... domesticated class so what do you think of those
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.720]  statements i just made well i'm not uh... to up on the depopulation
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:21.000]  stuff but i will i certainly agree with you that there is a uh...
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.320]  that there's the ruling elite does not like competition to attract
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:28.920]  the best livestock so an example of this which we're all pretty aware of is what
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:33.240]  just happened in iraq i remember it was about 10 or 15 years ago iran
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.760]  dropped its corporate tax rate to 13 and a half percent which was hugely
[01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:40.280]  lower than just about anywhere else so of course everybody goes swarming
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.200]  all over there and microsoft and other companies intel i think that i've
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.400]  had quarters there and the irish economy boom and everyone was like
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.080]  oh ireland is going to be the next european tiger of economic productivity
[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.800]  and so on and i remember even saying at the time it's like well
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:56.360]  that's just gonna allow them to have a bigger government which will and so
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:59.960]  they'll probably be one of the first to go bankrupt and that of course exactly
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:03.160]  what happened they've now gone bankrupt and the EU is putting in as a
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.000]  condition of the bailout of ireland that they increase
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.280]  their corporate tax rate because they don't want to lower their own they don't
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:13.720]  want ireland to be low so yeah there is a cross
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:17.240]  pollination of control mechanisms which is partly what the european currency
[01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:20.040]  the euro was all about now everybody's dependent
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.040]  on each other and so they're beginning to dictate cross-border wise
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:27.880]  that's lowering the competition and and destroying the last capacity for the
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.160]  threat of freedom in europe
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:34.920]  continue continue uh yeah well i think the same thing is going to happen to
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.120]  spain spain has an economy that is absolutely enormous
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.560]  relative to ireland it's close to happening in england
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:45.880]  england of course is slightly ahead of us in messing up the dependent classes
[01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:49.560]  by cutting their funding and so when spain goes down
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.360]  there's going to be a great challenge because the euro is going to face
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:55.400]  massive undertow it's going to be devalued relative because everybody's
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:59.000]  going to see you want to know what what european what the european economic
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.120]  situation looks like all you have to do is imagine
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.400]  an operating room or an er right it's got like
[01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:09.320]  20 or 30 patients in it and they're all bleeding but some of them are bleeding a
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:12.360]  little bit more than others so what the doctors are doing is they're
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.160]  hoovering the blood out of the ones who are bleeding the least
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.280]  and they're pumping it into the ones who are bleeding them up well of course the
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.080]  only end product of all of that is all the patients are going to die
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:24.760]  and that of course is not remarked upon in the media it's just something that
[01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:28.040]  can't be talked about that's always you forgot one part of the equation we're
[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:31.000]  going to come back in one minute and finish up with it you forgot one part
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.320]  of that great analogy because there's a there's something else going on in the
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:43.640]  hospital er triage area where all this blood is running out on the floor
[01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:52.120]  thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today

[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.960]  we're talking about the nature of human society on this planet i want to get
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:34.520]  into what stefan author researcher what his views are on where
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.800]  society's going on its current path versus
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:44.040]  his ideas to reverse that trend and where he would take us you know if he
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:48.280]  was king and obviously he's a pretty much an anarchist so he didn't
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:51.320]  want to be king but he'll king for a day what would he do
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:54.200]  stefan malinu is our guest this is a short segment
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.080]  long segment coming up if you want to talk to stefan or bring up
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.840]  any of the news items we've discussed today the toll free number is 800
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:08.600]  25 at 9 9231 800 25 at 9 9231 open phones in this third and final hour
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:12.200]  today stefan for stations that just joined us gave
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:18.120]  a great analogy of what's happening in greece
[02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:24.200]  what's happening right now over in ireland and how it's now
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:26.760]  spreading out to germany and england and the united states
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:33.720]  you've got a bunch of people in a er and you've got greece and other nations
[02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:37.560]  like ireland that are bleeding to death and they don't fix the wounds the system
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:41.160]  stays the same but they take blood from the other countries that aren't
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:45.320]  bleeding as bad yet and they're pumping it in uh to the countries that are
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.680]  bleeding out but they're not fixing the wounds so it's just pouring out
[02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:52.920]  now the system knows that why then are they not even closing the wounds
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:58.360]  changing the system because parasitic parasitic vampires i mean
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:01.880]  stefan called them parasites earlier that's what a mosquito is it's a it's a
[02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:06.120]  you know uh blood sucking insect these globalists
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:11.000]  are there in the hospital bloated fat goblin like creatures
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.080]  literally sucking all the blood running down the channel rails
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.880]  into their mouths so that's what's happening uh what's your review on that
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:23.800]  stefan well i think that's right uh an analogy that i thought of that i think
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:27.320]  makes the most sense is uh you know the if you've ever seen the indian indiana
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.880]  jones films in the very first one he's in the treasure room and all these goals
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.960]  and and the jewels and all of the riches of the ancient world
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:40.600]  and he grabs what he needs and then he sees a huge door begin to slide down
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.760]  slowly and he he grabs what he wants and he runs out and he rolls out and he
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:48.120]  just reaches back to grab his hash before the door comes down
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:52.680]  well it's been clear really since the 1960s and 70s and 1970s
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:57.080]  and going off the gold standard or the remains of the gold standard
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:03:02.040]  that the system is not going to last and the system is so close to the end now
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:05.880]  that expecting rational long-term coherent behavior from the ruling class
[02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:09.960]  at the moment is is not really uh it's not really very rational
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.720]  and so what's happening is because the system is is shutting down the system
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.000]  is reaching its end game people are just trying to grab as much as humanly
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.280]  possible before you know like indiana jones just grab as much as you
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:23.160]  that's a great point we see this in every society
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:26.200]  as the ship burns people are just grabbing goods
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:30.280]  and jumping off there's an acceleration uh it's kind of like
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:33.960]  exterminators talk about when you spray cockroaches with poison they start
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.840]  mating you know trying to reproduce it
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:41.560]  there's like a wild party that goes on the brink truck explodes in the poor
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:44.440]  neighborhood blowing hundred dollar bills up into the sky
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:47.400]  you don't expect people to sit around and wonder about their retirement they
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:51.240]  just run out like crazy like a shock feeding frenzy grab whatever they can
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:54.680]  and every policy that i've seen introduced over the past few years
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:58.360]  is just a massive cash grab that involves huge transfers of wealth
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.480]  from the private to the public sector uh some of it going to the dependent
[02:04:01.480 --> 02:04:04.760]  classes to continue to buy their relationships but most of it blowing
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.800]  up with a few farmers and the rulers and if you really analyze what is going on
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.640]  it is all about private public sector transfers or
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.800]  peaceful violent sector transfer and because the
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:21.160]  public sector is so dwarfing and engulfing and destroying
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.680]  our government's always cancer cancer generally grow to destroy the host and
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.360]  that's the same thing the government you can very clearly see
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.520]  that it is overwhelming the body politics that the number of public sector
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:36.200]  jobs that have been created over the past 10 years versus what have been created
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.120]  in the private sector is vastly greater in the public sector
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.800]  the unsponded liability of the public sector pensions
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.960]  are staggering i mean the past it's impossible to pay back stay there let's
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:51.080]  let's go through where you see this system going on the other side and then
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.680]  ideas you've got to turn it around we'll be right back with our guests stay with

[02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:23.960]  stephan maladu is our guest he's joining us from a hotel room in
[02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:27.240]  phoenix arizona he's gonna be talking at the uh 2010
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:31.320]  freedom summit there we're having back on in the next few weeks via video link
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:34.600]  when he's back home uh in canada
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:39.080]  and he joins us now if you just tuned in listeners we've been talking about the
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:43.720]  fact that we live on a plantation that we're seen as human resources and
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:49.000]  i went over the fact earlier that the globalists have decided they don't
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.400]  need us anymore they have said they want to dramatically
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.240]  call the numbers of people they don't want nations
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.080]  competing with each other anymore you know sub ruling classes they are forming
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:05.560]  one giant global corporate hive borg controlling oligarchy
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:09.480]  that is eugenics based that wants to cut off our resources
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:14.200]  through a neo feudalistic uh system and the un and their
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:17.720]  memorandums in the 1996 biological diversity assessment
[02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:22.520]  they call it modern feudalism they say feudalism is better for the environment
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:26.600]  so they are clearly trying to reinstate an even older form
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:32.040]  and more abusive form of tyranny uh and you know the cycle of history shows
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:34.600]  that when you do have liberty it produces incredible wealth
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.160]  but then it grows a big corrupt government uh so talking to stefan
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:43.480]  stefan uh again we were getting into these impossible to pay back
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:47.160]  debts from the domesticated population most the money's been siphoned off to
[02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:49.480]  the ruling class the banks are all making super
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  record profits consolidating power but the howling
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:58.680]  welfare class uh is now being forged into an army against the middle class
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:03.560]  from your research why does the ruling elite hate the middle class so much
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:07.000]  because clearly they do it's their ancestral enemy
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.360]  right right i think that's a great question uh it's it's hard to say for
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:13.640]  sure because they don't exactly publish this stuff too openly
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.360]  my guess would be that the parasite always hates
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.760]  the host because the host reminds the parasite that he's a parasite
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:26.280]  so the fact that the ruling classes who are driven by
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:30.920]  you know egomania grandiosity narcissism and a kind of madness i mean these
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:34.120]  people are going to be classified as insane in the future in the same way that
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:38.120]  we look at the nazi eugenics is insane so they seem perfectly reasonable at the
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:41.560]  time to most people and so the fact that there are free
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:45.720]  and productive and happy and voluntary people in the world
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.880]  reminds the ruling classes of what desperate sociopathic parasites they
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.920]  really are and it just reminds them of that and so i
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:55.640]  think that's one of the reasons that they hate them because it
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:59.000]  it pricks their vanity in the fact that they think that they rule the world
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.280]  but they're actually dependent upon joe six back who goes to work
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.960]  and produces something of value for a living rather than just moving well i
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:09.320]  totally agree with you assessing their psychology reading their own writings
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:13.960]  and i believe it's a delusion that they dream of not having a surround
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.800]  and having a high-tech robotic society that serves
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.160]  a tiny you know superior ruling class that
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.000]  so many of these people have written about that
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.160]  that that that's really their own self-hate the fact that they hate the
[02:11:29.160 --> 02:11:32.200]  general population so much the fact that they try to dumb the
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:38.200]  population down and that's on record shows their disdain for the host
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:41.160]  yeah and i think that they understand that deep down they're never going to
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:45.640]  achieve the kind of happiness and peace of mind and contentment and love
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:48.600]  and good relationships that free people have they just
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:52.680]  you know the masters secretly hate the slave dancing and singing and having a
[02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:55.080]  good time down at the end of the plantation
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.800]  because they're sort of stuck in their lonely house and they
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:01.880]  think that the masters need the slave but the slaves don't need the masters
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:05.080]  fundamentally and so i think there is a lot of hatred and
[02:12:05.080 --> 02:12:09.640]  recognition that it is not a life well lived to pray upon your
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:13.720]  fellow man and to brutalize and manipulate and sell off their future
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:16.120]  and destroy the brains of their children through
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.440]  miseducation that is not a life left well lived and i strongly believe
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:24.120]  in the endless power of the human conscience and that we all know deep
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:28.120]  down whether what we're doing is right or wrong and so deep down they know all
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:31.400]  of that but they don't want to deal with it and change their lives so they
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:34.920]  project all of that hatred onto other people all of that self-hatred gets
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:38.680]  funneled out under other people and it's like a bird attacking a mirror
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:42.040]  but thinking it's something else it's a tragic tragic state of mind in a sense
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.560]  we almost have to free the masters from themselves i know that that sounds
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:49.160]  perhaps a bit over compassionate but they in the long run or at least their
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:53.160]  descendants will be a lot happier if we pry these leeches off the neck of
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:57.880]  humanity they can actually grow their own two legs stand on their own two feet
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.440]  well you're absolutely right you know a painter produces paintings a
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:07.480]  philosopher produces philosophy uh the globalist
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:13.880]  you know cobbler makes shoes the globalist engineer societies
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:17.960]  so that they can continue on with their
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:24.680]  basic predatory parasitic power trip but this is all coming to an end and
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:27.720]  they've engineered it they believe they're going to get total power out of
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:31.160]  it but more and more of the indicators i see
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:35.720]  show that this is actually giving free humanity and those that do love true
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.200]  liberty a very good chance of routing these people
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.640]  but as ron paul has said over and over again as we come to this crisis point
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:49.560]  people that do love liberty have to be more active than ever
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.640]  because historically we tend to slip into even greater degradation
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:59.080]  after a system comes to an end it's very rare that we go to new heights so
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.000]  a briefly where do you see an ending what's your time frame
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.440]  and uh b what are your ideas to to not go over the edge of the cliff
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.200]  yeah i mean about five years ago i said five to 15 years and i still stick by
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:15.800]  that uh we're definitely entering the last few years of the existing system
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:19.880]  and it could even be shorter than that the the reason that it's going to go
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.240]  towards freedom and liberty is the exact same reason that you and i are having
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:25.720]  this conversation you and i only know each other
[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:28.200]  because of the internet because we're not going to be guests on the main
[02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.400]  street media at least not this main street media
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.840]  and so the internet is like the it's like the printing press right the printing
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:38.600]  press fragmented the unity of tyrannical christendom
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:42.360]  from the dark age it through new lights new interpretations
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:46.600]  new reasoning new evidence new philosophies into the world it resurrected
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:50.280]  the ancient greek philosophers and spread them across europe which gave people
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.360]  a new new process thought and it resurrected roman law which led to
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:57.880]  more secular cities which led to the growth of the industrial revolution
[02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:01.480]  the internet is exactly like the guttenberg press
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.000]  uh of the 14th and 15th century it is spreading thought
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.560]  outside of owned and regulated and state dominated channel
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:14.440]  and so the information that is going out it is much simpler to believe in peace
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:18.360]  than it is to convince yourself that violence predation and war are somehow
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.400]  good for humanity we have the simplest message the
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:24.200]  non-initiation of force the respect for property rights
[02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:27.320]  we have the simplest most consistent and clear message
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.520]  we've been right all along eindrand was right the
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:33.960]  Aristotle and Socrates were right when they talked about the immorality and
[02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:37.480]  destructiveness of an immoral life and so the fact that we have a clear
[02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:40.440]  message a consistent message a message that people can
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:43.480]  finally hear outside of state sanctioned channels
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:47.400]  is irresistible and it's going to turn the tide as long as we keep talking as
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.000]  long as we keep communicating so the system is going to come to an end
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.880]  but there is a level of communication we can now
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.400]  pass messages through the prison walls to each other and we are not there's
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:00.920]  going to be a big death row that's why they're moving worldwide to censor the
[02:16:00.920 --> 02:16:04.920]  web while they're trying to demonize peaceful resistance
[02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:08.680]  why the system is really trying to stage more terror attacks and
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:13.000]  stage more crises but yes liberty will win
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:17.320]  the only question is will it come sooner or later how painful is this going to
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:20.200]  be i think it's going to be less painful than we
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:23.080]  think i like what you have said many times in your show
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.480]  alex about get to know your neighbor get to know the people around you develop
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:31.320]  horizontal relationship because we so often get focused on our vertical
[02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:34.600]  relationships right looking up at the people who are dominating us
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.680]  looking down at the parasitical class that is feeding from us
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:42.600]  the way to substitute hierarchical authority is with horizontal
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.360]  relationship and the more that you get a hierarchical society
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.640]  the more those horizontal relationships tend to be undermined and destroyed or
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:52.040]  we don't look out to each other as much anymore
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:55.480]  developing these horizontal relationships if you have a firm
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:58.440]  community if you have a good circle of people around you
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.040]  you do not need to be your illness you do not need to be your poverty you do not
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.640]  need to be your isolation so you don't need to run to a government it is
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:09.880]  developing slave on slave love which sounds like a great movie
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:13.320]  but it's developing slave on slave love that will free us from the tyranny
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:18.120]  well exactly but going to walmart and buying useless crud is not fulfilling
[02:17:18.120 --> 02:17:22.840]  going with your neighbor on a camping trip or bass fishing
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:28.600]  or to the coast is fulfilling i mean society is so unfulfilled all the
[02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:32.920]  social studies and psychological studies show
[02:17:32.920 --> 02:17:37.080]  and then people think well i need more crud i need more garbage i need
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:41.720]  or some people i know who've never had big success never met hollywood stars
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:45.320]  never met government people never met scientists you know they imagine that
[02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.920]  they're unfulfilled because there's some floating island
[02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:52.920]  valhalla that they haven't attained as somebody who does know a lot of famous
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.120]  people and stuff i can tell you that is not going to fulfill you folks
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:59.000]  having your own property loving your neighbors
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.320]  being involved being able to control your own destiny being
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.840]  being given the responsibility to control your own destiny
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:11.320]  that is going to make you fulfilled and strong to a point i'm so fulfilled i'm
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.720]  so happy i've got so many ideas it's i'm so
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:20.200]  fulfilled it's almost torture stephan because i can't implement
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:25.160]  all the ideas burning in my mind well but i think that people can sense
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:27.560]  happiness and i think that we want to be
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:31.160]  gateway through which people can see the freedom peace and happiness of the
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:34.040]  future we kind of have to demonstrate how a free
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:36.920]  society looks like in our own personhood in our own
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:41.080]  interactions and then people i think will get that desire for it because a
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:44.920]  lot of people aren't open to reason but they are open to an example and i
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:48.120]  think people learn empirically that way and i think that's how
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:51.320]  we communicate most i agree that's why the co-intel pro and government
[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:54.520]  operatives try to tear down anybody who's positive
[02:18:54.520 --> 02:18:58.680]  and talks about how we can win together they want all this infighting and
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:03.160]  dissension and negativity when really uh... we have incredible power when we
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:07.800]  use it and the parasites know that yes and we of course have numbered them
[02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:11.480]  vastly and do we really all we have to fundamentally do with they know
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:15.560]  to free them from this ten thousand year old ridiculous pyramid that we should
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:19.880]  have outgrown when we threw out leeches for dealing with your illness
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:24.600]  well you're absolutely right and i i think back to the vampire analogy
[02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.040]  vampires have to have helpers count dracula has
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:32.040]  renfield and and that's what the welfare class is
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:39.160]  they are this quasi undead self-propelled stomachs eating at mcdonald's and i'm
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:42.520]  not saying i'm perfect either folks the point is i can recognize it i can
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:44.920]  recognize what's wrong in me and what's good in me
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:47.960]  and we've got to reach out to the renfields
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:52.200]  and and and and try to somehow you know uh get them to realize the
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:55.960]  the trance they're in stefan stay there i want to come back

[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.760]  technocracy in the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Newt Gennrich,
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:26.600]  David Rockefeller and many others so we better hope

[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:38.280]  elites are out of control we're having too much sucked off of us
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:43.080]  it's time to stand up and say no there's been a huge development on the google
[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:46.520]  censorship front but i'm not going to get to it till our guest leaves us at
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:53.240]  about 45 after huge development but i'm just going to say this
[02:24:53.240 --> 02:24:57.800]  google has backed down i've never seen anything like this before
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:01.240]  uh but again it shows the power that you have out there but i'll go over it
[02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:05.160]  coming up uh just amazing information uh now we
[02:25:05.160 --> 02:25:10.040]  got a bunch of callers here for Stefan and this only happens
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.400]  about once a year but the phone system then shut down at
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.320]  genesis it's having a few problems but five phone calls got through but that'll
[02:25:17.320 --> 02:25:21.720]  be it because the system shut down uh we've got our own phone system here this
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:25.320]  happens maybe once a year but hopefully these calls will work
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:29.560]  if not we'll give them our number here uh kevin in canada you're on the air with
[02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:32.920]  our guest and you're welcome to talk about anything you want go ahead
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:36.440]  hey alex thanks so much for accepting my call i'm a first-time caller
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:40.440]  um you talked a lot about the economic state in the united states and what you
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:44.440]  see happening for for the united states you and gerald flante
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:49.000]  and many others have said um you see a terror attack happening you see the
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.440]  banks shutting down and the american people being blamed for it
[02:25:52.440 --> 02:25:55.640]  my question is do you see a similar circumstance
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:59.480]  happening for canada for instance do you see the banks shutting down you see
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:03.400]  there being a terror attack and if you do see this happening for canada
[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:07.080]  do you see this happening this year or the next year okay well an attack on
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.200]  england an attack on france an attack on japan
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:13.720]  it's used globally to take everybody's liberties
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:17.720]  even the governments that aren't aligned with each other use 9-11 to crack down
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:20.680]  on their population stefan you take that question
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:23.880]  yeah that's a good it's a great question there are several indicators in the
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:28.200]  canadian economy that are even worse than the american economy our housing
[02:26:28.200 --> 02:26:31.000]  bubble is larger than the american housing bubble
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.640]  bubble was when it first for catheter death is is huge in canada
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:39.240]  one of the major differences between canada and the united states of course
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:43.080]  is that canada relative to the u.s has almost no military
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.560]  industrial complex one of the huge challenges of dismantling
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.440]  and a sort of violent empire a an imperialistic empire which america is
[02:26:52.440 --> 02:26:56.440]  to a large degree in canada is almost not is that you have all of these
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:59.560]  troops you have all of this weaponry you have all of these people who've been
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.360]  trained to take orders and to point their guns at people that some guy in a
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.880]  green hat tells them so dismantling that is huge
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:10.840]  one of the reasons that england i believe developed
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.760]  such socialist leanings after the second world war i mean what a crazy
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:18.600]  tragedy to spend your youth and your blood fighting
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:21.720]  national socialism and then to impose socialism
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:24.440]  at the end of the second world war well the problem is that you have an
[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:29.080]  enormous number of people who are not very fit to work in the free market
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:31.880]  they have been working for the government either directly or indirectly
[02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:36.440]  they have been received it's created a bunch of lazy dumb down people who
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:40.760]  think it's a moral responsibility to be intellectually lazy
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:43.960]  what do you call that phenomenon stefan where people
[02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:48.520]  actually revel in being slobs revel in not caring about life
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:52.600]  they're only alive one time and they think anybody that talks about how magic
[02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.000]  life is is a joke yeah i mean i think that to me that
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.160]  was most of my peers in graduate school i don't know what to call it technically
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:04.840]  so canada's not going to have to worry about dismantling the empire the u.s
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.120]  is going to have to worry about dismantling the empire and what to do
[02:28:08.120 --> 02:28:11.880]  with the hundreds of thousands of mentally scarred troops uh who have
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:14.600]  substance abuse problems these people got to go somewhere and they're going to
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:16.920]  come home and they're going to be a huge problem to manage
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:21.320]  absolutely let's uh let's go to another caller i mean i mean i basically agree
[02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:24.600]  with uh what stefan was saying there kevin good question
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:30.200]  kathryn in new york you're on the air hello hey welcome
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:34.760]  oh thank god you can hear me um okay i'm going to try like really hard to
[02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:38.760]  contain my excitement because i'm just so glad that you guys are talking about
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.920]  stuff that i've been saying like pretty much my whole entire life
[02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:48.440]  um and i guess my my question or my dilemma actually
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:51.720]  because you know again you guys were just saying it about
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:55.640]  from stefan just mentioned about horizontal relationships i mean again
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:29:00.520]  like that's pretty much um where i feel pretty trapped i guess you could say
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:05.240]  is because um like i didn't grow up in a family
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:09.480]  like like i mean like i literally felt you know i've known this stuff my whole
[02:29:09.480 --> 02:29:13.000]  life and that my my own family basically was like they kind of like
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.080]  you know really pinned against one another and all i've tried to do is
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.680]  we've been trained by the social engineers men against women women against
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:24.760]  men black against white uh catholic against you know
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.680]  protestant muslim against jew jew against muslim
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.440]  and and and again they use that to compartmentalize stay there kathryn
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.920]  we're gonna come back and get stefan's take on what you were saying
[02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:41.480]  then i've got the big google news uh in our fight with those guys trying to
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:46.440]  censor us we've got a victory on one front not on the other front yet
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:51.640]  google search term google evil we'll be right back stay with us
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:55.480]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:30:00.360]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:06.520]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:10.760]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:13.720]  agenda uh they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:30:13.720 --> 02:30:16.920]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:21.320]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:26.200]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:30.760]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:33.800]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:37.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:30:37.080 --> 02:30:40.120]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:43.560]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:47.000]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc

[02:32:11.720 --> 02:32:15.400]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:19.560]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:23.240]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:27.640]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:32:27.640 --> 02:32:31.560]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:34.920]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:32:34.920 --> 02:32:38.680]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:29.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:33.640]  stephan mullenew is our guest and i'm trying to jam in a few more calls for
[02:33:33.640 --> 02:33:36.040]  him but i gotta get to all this other news so please have your question or
[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:39.800]  comment ready kathryn crystallizing boiling down
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:43.080]  what you're saying or what your question or statement is i mean just
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:46.360]  elaborate briefly on what you were trying to say
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:50.600]  um it's basically about the horizontal relationships and i i mean
[02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:55.800]  in a nutshell there isn't anyone to have a horizontal relationship with because
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:59.480]  like i feel like you know everybody's been so brainwashed to keep
[02:33:59.480 --> 02:34:03.880]  everyone else in line and every time i try to wake them up
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:07.640]  they're like injecting me verbally with something to put me back to
[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:11.400]  no i know a lot of times if you're nice to somebody under you
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.800]  they'll subconsciously think you're weak and then try to dominate you
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:18.680]  uh and i and i mean i learned this growing up not that i'm some perfect
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.400]  person i mean after somebody attacks me then i become very vicious very sneaky
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:28.440]  very aggressive but i i was never envious of wealth and power and beauty i
[02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:31.880]  always admired it but so many of the quote underclass
[02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:35.720]  they just hate anyone who has a penny more than them
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.320]  and they hate and disdain those under them that have a penny less
[02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:44.440]  and it's like their worth is some type of false template or hologram in their
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:48.600]  mind of kind of like baseball cards they've collected
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:52.520]  instead of just being an awe of the magic of consciousness
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:56.280]  and the human experience on this incredible planet hurtling through deep
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:59.160]  space but i hear what you're saying katherine it's very
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:03.960]  very frustrating humans are hierarchical at their base because we were
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:07.960]  meant to admire the strongest the most loving the most dynamic
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.360]  those with the most charisma in our tribes but we were in small enough groups
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:15.880]  that that empowered the whole group to emulate the strong
[02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:19.800]  and to honor the pure if you go back to really ancient societies
[02:35:19.800 --> 02:35:23.640]  then as they became bigger the parasite con artist class
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:27.080]  comes in whether it's the Aztecs the Babylonians the ancient
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.520]  Visigoths it every culture does the same thing stefan what's your view on that
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:36.840]  yeah i agree if if you if people can't see you you just have to get bigger you
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:40.840]  have to get bigger and bigger until people can see you i'm the kind of guy who
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:44.440]  i want to take on the biggest goliath because the greater the enemy
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:47.720]  the greater the pride of victory and we are going to win
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:51.800]  but people can't see you over the shadow of goliath so you just have to
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.880]  here put on your heels make a podcast make a blog write a book
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:00.600]  call into shows until people can see you and then i think that they will join
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.640]  you and i think we should all be proud of taking on
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:07.080]  the greatest and oldest tyranny in the face of the world because there's going
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:10.200]  to be much honor when we win and the fact that it looks sometimes
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:13.400]  hopeless the fact that we look so small relative to the goliath that we're
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:17.320]  fighting just makes our courage all the greater and i hope that helps
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:20.760]  exactly here's a relationship example and this has been well documented in
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:24.280]  psychological studies and just in common sense
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:29.000]  some of the easiest women say you're 20 years old in college or working
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.720]  some of the easiest women to pick up for a date
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:38.200]  are the most beautiful bombshells and that's because most people are
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:43.480]  intimidated by them a but b people are mean to good-looking people
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:46.520]  people i mean i'm not super great-looking now because i'm like 30
[02:36:46.520 --> 02:36:49.480]  pounds overweight and getting to be middle-aged but when i was
[02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:53.560]  you know 15 20 25 i mean i was super good-looking
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:57.880]  and i always wondered why and as i got older i understood it
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:37:01.720]  why normally people that would see themselves as ugly hated me so much
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.080]  it was because i was seen as archetypally good looking
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:09.640]  and uh but but the same thing is for why do you see so many guys who aren't
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:12.440]  really super handsome with beautiful women
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:15.880]  well they've got a good personality they've got other things that are beautiful
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:20.600]  uh and they're also learn the secret that the better look in the woman the
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:23.960]  easier they are to pick up for a date i mean i'm not
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:27.880]  stephanie see where i'm going with this that that none of it we're not confident
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:31.720]  in ourselves yeah i think that's right i think that
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:35.800]  we look as we're looking at history not at the future you know we need to shoot
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:38.840]  it's like a grappling hook you know you see in those flying movies they shoot
[02:37:38.840 --> 02:37:42.280]  this grappling hook up to the top of the parapet and then they pull themselves
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:44.760]  up we don't need to look back at everything
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.800]  that's been lost we don't need to look back at all the disasters that have
[02:37:47.800 --> 02:37:50.280]  occurred we don't even look into the near future
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:54.120]  where this transition is going to occur we need to shoot our hopes like a huge
[02:37:54.120 --> 02:37:57.160]  grappling hook and climb up to a future that may be a
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:00.680]  generational way but we can still get there if you focus on the immediate
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.200]  you will lose heart because they have the aircraft carriers they have them
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:07.560]  nuclear weapons they have the prisons they have the currency
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:11.160]  but if you shoot your hopes over the present into the future
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:14.440]  that gives you propulsion and that allows you to spread hope to others
[02:38:14.440 --> 02:38:20.120]  yeah we've got to leave we've got to lead and and the pentagon admits now 90
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.080]  percent of their operations are info war there is a war on for your mind
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:29.000]  they know that if they can't dominate your mind they've lost it doesn't matter
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:32.680]  what weapon systems they have
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:36.600]  the state is an effect of a delusion called the inconsequence of the citizens
[02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:39.960]  then as soon as we drop that loss of confidence as soon as we drop that
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:43.400]  inconsequentiality the state shrinks to nothing in our minds
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.160]  stefan do you agree with me and i foresaw this almost five weeks ago
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:50.760]  that the tsa is bigger than just saying no to them dominating us and putting
[02:38:50.760 --> 02:38:54.520]  their hands down their pants the social engineers know this is about the next
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:58.920]  level of tyranny being searched in our homes our roads the shopping malls
[02:38:58.920 --> 02:39:04.760]  our our our offices and they know that our resistance to this
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:08.840]  is a symbol of us getting our will back and our strength
[02:39:08.840 --> 02:39:13.080]  and and and and standing up to them and that if we stand up to them on this
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:16.440]  and have victory we'll stand up on everything and have victory
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:20.600]  and that's why they're so scared everything that the state does every
[02:39:20.600 --> 02:39:23.960]  expansion of state power is a trial balloon and if we
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:27.320]  shoot it down they withdraw and they go someplace else
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:32.200]  and so yeah i think the containment i think that recognizing that the tsa it
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:35.480]  was inevitable that they were going to end up groping people and body scanning
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:38.840]  because that's what the government does they take a reasonable idea like
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:42.440]  security and turned it into a tyranny every single time so
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.960]  yeah every expansion of state power is a trial balloon to see what people will
[02:39:45.960 --> 02:39:50.280]  accept absolutely uh let's talk to shon and ohio
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:53.560]  you're on the air with our guests go ahead
[02:39:53.560 --> 02:39:58.600]  hey what's up worldwide transmission what's on your mind i just uh the google

[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.680]  i've got to spend some time on this to explain it uh our people will misunderstand
[02:40:12.680 --> 02:40:15.400]  it uh if i if i don't you know communicate it maybe
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.280]  because i'm not a good communicator but uh the point is is that i'm going to get

[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:00.360]  liberty people show anybody that wants us to post their columns if it's
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:04.040]  online with uh you know basically the liberty movement exposing the globalist
[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:07.800]  and and and if i read over it looks like it's well researched and factual
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:11.400]  we'll start carrying your work but uh anything for our guest
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:16.760]  yes uh psychologically what i i i think that we're going to win especially on
[02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:20.520]  the uh what i think is the most important issue which is the federal reserve
[02:41:20.520 --> 02:41:25.480]  the the the war chest that the globalists create for themselves
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:28.680]  with this concrete scheme that is our money system
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:31.800]  is if we attack that everything else will crumble
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:36.200]  but the problem that i have alex and uh step on it and see if you can address
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.760]  this when the that issue is won i think there is going to be a
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:45.000]  financial collapse in this in this country and i think that
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.720]  inevitably the people who looked at us as the conspiracy theorists and the ron
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:52.440]  paul supporters are going to say hey wait a second
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.000]  uh you are the guy that pushed for the collapse of the end of the fed and now
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.600]  look what happened when when i and that's what i've been saying that for years
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:03.800]  no no no no they did that during the great depression
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:07.560]  the bankers suck you dry they they vert they vertically integrate the money
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:10.920]  when it implodes they allow opposition to come in and blame it on them
[02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:14.360]  they're already blaming rand paul who's never been in office for the depression
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.960]  that's coming saying he caused it because he wants to audit the fed
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:21.880]  great points appreciate the call steven comments
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.880]  well yeah look it's entirely right that the power to print your own money the
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:29.080]  power to type whatever you want into your own bank account is not something
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.920]  that people are going to give up likely you can't have war and oppression
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:36.760]  without fear currency fundamentally or at least it's very very very limited in
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:40.600]  what can be achieved so it is absolutely essential that currency be
[02:42:40.600 --> 02:42:43.560]  privatized and that there's competing currencies and that
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:47.880]  violence is not used it is as simple as to make the case against the fed is as
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:51.080]  simple as making the universal moral statement
[02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:55.000]  that counterfeiting is immoral and it doesn't matter whether you're a guy in a
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:58.520]  suit in a big office or you're a guy in a basement in his underwear it is
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:02.200]  immoral to counterfeit money and government is a subject to
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:05.320]  virtue and vice and good and evil as anybody else
[02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:09.320]  because counterfeit destroys what people really saved
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:14.200]  and it gives unfair trade advantage to the insiders
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:17.400]  yeah and it's a terrible tax on the poor it's the it's the most brutal tax on
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.240]  the poor inflation anybody who's on a fixed income anybody who's spending a
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.720]  large proportion of their income on the essentials gets completely destroyed
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.640]  by absolutely well said well said rushing through calls here we'll have
[02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:34.280]  you back soon look forward to it let's go to matt in the uk you're on with
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:39.240]  stefan malinu go ahead hi alex and then good afternoon and that's near stefan
[02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:41.720]  my first point is from a british point of view is
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.000]  when you mention about the fat slobs in the uk by the way
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.360]  get your facts right on the first point of view is not everyone's a fat slob in
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:51.880]  the uk is basically when alex isn't mentioned about this well not
[02:43:51.880 --> 02:43:56.280]  everybody's a fat slob in the u.s but i am no no i mean i'm not saying
[02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:59.880]  everybody's a fat slob in the uk hey well it's not at all
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:03.960]  you're not at all what i was saying is i was mentioning an intellect like myself
[02:44:03.960 --> 02:44:08.280]  is in the uk um there's people are hardworking like myself
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:13.320]  and and uh and as you're working and things like that and we keep that the
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:18.200]  the uk going uh basically my point is is basically i know that new world order
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.560]  are going to cripple this country and the bankers get
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:24.840]  absolute trillions of millions of pounds which they are doing now on the bell
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:28.120]  in island doubt is um look we're living in a
[02:44:28.120 --> 02:44:31.960]  terry even the uk the u.s doesn't know this and we've got um
[02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:36.680]  secret police in this country oh you do yeah i want i want i like to take on that
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:41.400]  it uh what do you think of that well i mean look if you look at the uk the
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:45.640]  u.s europe australia it's the exact same system it's a corporate
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:49.400]  form of governance and i appreciate your call matt i'm out of time with bill
[02:44:49.400 --> 02:44:52.280]  rashid eric and others because i've got to get to the other news
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:59.800]  but uh that final question uh from matt in the uk what's your view on that
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:04.200]  step on well i sorry i do think that uh the u.s the uk is going to go through
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:07.400]  the same kind of fiscal crunch as everyone else i completely appreciate
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:10.520]  and agree with you there have to be hardworking people
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:14.680]  in the uk who are producing goods and services that people want
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:18.040]  in the same way that you have to have livestock on a farm otherwise it's not a
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.320]  farm so the fact that you have a ruling class means that you have productive
[02:45:21.320 --> 02:45:24.680]  and energetic and creative people all we have to do is pry them off your necks
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.120]  and let you flourish and the world can become a much better place
[02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:32.760]  absolutely well great work you're doing and i just really appreciate the great
[02:45:32.760 --> 02:45:35.480]  youtube videos that you're putting out and i look

[02:46:04.920 --> 02:46:08.360]  videos here as well very very informative and
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:15.400]  thought-provoking information okay i've got some other congressional news
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:18.600]  and some economy news i want to get to and
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:22.200]  also maybe get to a few of these calls that are still holding
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:28.440]  like uh what was it shon in ohio i had a question about uh google google the
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:31.160]  parent company of youtube in the last two weeks
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:37.320]  banned prison planet news stories from showing up in google news feeds they
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:41.160]  delisted us and nothing changed in our servers
[02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:44.680]  nothing changed now we send them out they just delisted us and gave us no
[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:48.440]  notice and a lot of that's because of the tsa
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.200]  obviously we're leading the fight on that front
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:56.360]  and bob bar is now investigating uh tsa and homeland security investigating
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:59.480]  myself and matt drudge that's the effect we're having here
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:02.840]  ladies and gentlemen because of you spreading the word and we're all doing
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:06.200]  this together i want to continue to point that out
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:10.440]  it is your actions that are having this effect then separately we were given a
[02:47:10.440 --> 02:47:16.760]  community guidelines violation by youtube a subsidiary of google a few
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:20.440]  weeks ago banning our video collateral murder
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.680]  that showed a short clip of the apache helicopter killing some journalist
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:30.520]  youtube's official channel had the video russia today associated press cbs news
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:35.400]  i've already talked about all this just just recapping for new listeners
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:39.080]  and so we went into the community violation because we got more of them
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:43.240]  the site would be shut down that one site with 75 plus million
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:48.520]  views on it and accelerating growing faster and faster
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:52.120]  230 plus million views conservatively the last two years on the other channels
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:55.400]  combined just on youtube one platform we're using
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:48:00.920]  that's a small part of what we do but not inconsequential
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:04.360]  and that's where we reach the average yuppies and young people and and you
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:08.520]  know folks that are kind of sucked into the board hive mind
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:13.240]  we got a notice and we and we went and counter claimed and said this video is

[02:49:43.240 --> 02:49:46.120]  and normally in a few hours after the notice because as soon as you go into
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:49.000]  your account it tells you we're shutting your account down and then it
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.160]  gets shut down when you visit the site it didn't happen
[02:49:53.160 --> 02:49:57.320]  that's like obama deception getting removed
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:02.680]  and it's said removed by user we didn't remove it
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:06.680]  it had like five million views at the time it has like eight million on that
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:10.920]  one channel alone or is it nine million it's about to be nine million
[02:50:10.920 --> 02:50:14.520]  guys uh go to youtube and type in the obama deception please just type in the

[02:50:17.960 --> 02:50:21.560]  be technical here i want to be exact and
[02:50:21.560 --> 02:50:24.600]  that's just one version over 30 million on youtube alone and
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:31.240]  google views on that one video and
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.080]  they erased it and then we made a big protest and they just put it back
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:38.840]  up and they said that couldn't be done so they're playing all sorts of games
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:42.040]  with us and this is a psychological warfare tactic
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:45.960]  keep messing with us keep taking stuff down keep until you get tired of
[02:50:45.960 --> 02:50:49.240]  hearing about it and don't respond and protest them
[02:50:49.240 --> 02:50:52.600]  and then they win so that's all that's happening but we're gonna update our
