[00:00.000 --> 00:27.840]  It's February 21st, the year is 2020, it is Friday, 255 days out from the election.
[00:27.840 --> 00:39.080]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Our very existence is because of your support in defiance of
[00:39.080 --> 00:47.560]  the post-humanist technocrats' operations. Well, this is going to be a transmission
[00:47.560 --> 00:53.200]  that no one should miss. I am going to try to zen out as much as I can and just cover
[00:53.200 --> 00:58.560]  this news. When we come back, we have a raft of informative, important guests, four of
[00:58.560 --> 01:06.920]  them. I also intend to try to jam some calls in. We have the most important coronavirus
[01:06.920 --> 01:13.800]  information yet that we're going to be breaking down. I've done a deep analysis of it that
[01:13.800 --> 01:21.200]  is all coming up here today. Mike Adams joins us at the bottom of the hour with the big
[01:21.200 --> 01:31.320]  new developments. Please understand this is a participation sport for the future of humanity.
[01:31.320 --> 01:35.880]  If you don't tell people about Bandod Video and ImpleWars.com for its last show, the enemy
[01:35.880 --> 01:45.840]  will win. If you do take action, we will win.
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.920]  In June of 2019, two million Hong Kongers took to the streets to protest the communist
[01:51.920 --> 02:01.960]  Chinese government. Men, women and children all united against communism and thousands
[02:01.960 --> 02:08.640]  of young protesters willing to be martyrs. It was a serious problem for Xi Jinping's
[02:08.640 --> 02:19.560]  regime. The protests grew and the world watched. Everyone asking, how will China make this
[02:19.560 --> 02:30.960]  go away? On October 1st, the communist Chinese celebrated the 70th anniversary of their revolution.
[02:30.960 --> 02:39.000]  No end in sight for the growing protests. A couple weeks later, on October 18, the Bill
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.120]  and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with John Hopkins and the World Economic Forum, hosted
[02:45.120 --> 02:53.280]  Event 201, a high-level pandemic simulation based on the coronavirus, wherein they concluded
[02:53.280 --> 03:02.480]  that it could kill 65 million people. A couple weeks after that, on Halloween, the controversial
[03:02.480 --> 03:11.320]  5G network was fully test-fired for the first time in Wuhan, China. Scientists have warned
[03:11.320 --> 03:20.440]  us that 5G causes flu-like symptoms. Weeks later, the coronavirus outbreak begins in
[03:20.440 --> 03:32.680]  Wuhan, China. And the protests in Hong Kong abruptly come to an end. Are they related?
[03:32.680 --> 03:39.120]  China was not prepared for President Trump's trade war. And by most accounts, Xi Jinping
[03:39.120 --> 03:47.720]  was losing ground. Massive levels of sulfur dioxide gas was detected on the outskirts
[03:47.720 --> 03:55.960]  of Wuhan, causing many to ask if they are burning bodies. A staffer from a funeral home
[03:55.960 --> 04:06.040]  in Wuhan claims that her funeral home alone has cremated and estimated 4,725 bodies suspected
[04:06.040 --> 04:15.360]  of dying from the coronavirus since January 22. Experts tell us the virus was weaponized
[04:15.360 --> 04:24.160]  in a lab. And while nobody disputes this fact, the mainstream media hide it. The numbers
[04:24.160 --> 04:30.080]  are now beginning to show themselves outside of China. And in a short time, we will all
[04:30.080 --> 04:38.680]  know the true impact of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak of 2020. But so far, it does not look
[04:38.680 --> 04:58.960]  good at all. For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:58.960 --> 05:16.520]  I started working at Infowars. I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars.com, but
[05:16.520 --> 05:32.080]  Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests, Telomere and Telomere
[05:32.080 --> 05:47.600]  so I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an
[05:47.600 --> 05:49.120]  elite supplement.
[05:49.120 --> 06:05.760]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should
[06:05.760 --> 06:23.040]  try it.
[06:23.040 --> 06:29.800]  Try to February 21, 2020. I am your host, Alex Jones. Thank you for joining us. Thank
[06:29.800 --> 06:39.520]  you for passing on the fact that the pro-human anti-technocrat resistance lives at Infowars
[06:39.520 --> 06:45.160]  and it lives in your hearts, in your minds, in your actions. We will be victorious if
[06:45.160 --> 06:52.440]  you take action. If you do not take action, a true nightmare future awaits us all. There
[06:52.440 --> 07:00.920]  can no longer be any doubts about those facts. Let me get right in to the most important
[07:00.920 --> 07:11.480]  information because everything else happening can be dealt with if we have this basic power,
[07:11.480 --> 07:18.040]  which is the power of free expression. Now, we can see the seduction by big corporations
[07:18.040 --> 07:24.160]  and governments of the Internet, where for its first 20 years or so of it being popularized
[07:24.160 --> 07:29.320]  and being used on mass scale, it had been around for decades before that, but by the
[07:29.320 --> 07:35.560]  time it became popularized in the early 90s to the mid-90s, whatever was most popular,
[07:35.560 --> 07:39.480]  whatever people voted up, went to the top. And you'd usually get really good answers
[07:39.480 --> 07:45.160]  from whatever was at the top of Google and other systems. And it was a thing where we
[07:45.160 --> 07:50.480]  communicated together and we promoted Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and we put our content
[07:50.480 --> 07:58.640]  on YouTube. It's about you. But as soon as they had gathered us all together, as soon
[07:58.640 --> 08:08.840]  as they'd gotten us under their control, then they enslaved us to the one central AI grid
[08:08.840 --> 08:14.880]  that is now setting the parameters of being able to have access to the Internet and waging
[08:14.880 --> 08:20.440]  war against the pockets of the still free Internet and monopolistically buying up all
[08:20.440 --> 08:28.200]  their competition. This is a post-freedom worldwide tyranny. It is the great threat
[08:28.200 --> 08:35.240]  of the current time we live in and existentially into the future. It is the challenge not just
[08:35.240 --> 08:43.440]  of our time or our age, but of the entire human condition. The decision has been made
[08:43.440 --> 08:50.720]  by the technocrats that the carbon-based form of human life is obsolete and that they, the
[08:50.720 --> 08:59.560]  social Darwinists, are going to end the species and transmute themselves or transcend into
[08:59.560 --> 09:10.400]  a silicon body. That is the official religion of the Satanist in Silicon Valley. And you
[09:10.400 --> 09:15.600]  hear them openly saying it. I told you about it 20 years ago. It was in their white papers.
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.560]  Now they're public about it. And I've been around some of these people. And I know people
[09:20.560 --> 09:28.080]  that know them very, very well. And I'm just going to leave it at that. I mean, Mike Judge
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.480]  made Silicon Valley. Mike Judge is a famous engineer. He was the head engineer over the
[09:32.480 --> 09:44.160]  F-18. The man has probably 180 IQ. We're good friends. But the point is that he's witnessed
[09:44.160 --> 09:53.880]  it. He's seen how they are. Yeah, you didn't know Mike Judge was the main manager on the
[09:53.880 --> 09:59.640]  F-18 avionics computer systems before. Demons and Butthead before King of the Hill. But
[09:59.640 --> 10:15.120]  listen, I'm digressing. It doesn't matter. The headline for the live show today at infowars.com
[10:15.120 --> 10:22.680]  is Twitter announces social credit score for users. Just like that, they said we're going
[10:22.680 --> 10:29.760]  to have a point system that the community decides, Maoist, on how many points you have right
[10:29.760 --> 10:34.240]  out of black mirror. But see, black mirror was only mirroring what China already had
[10:34.240 --> 10:41.400]  and what the plan was. Predictive programming to condition you to show you the dystopia
[10:41.400 --> 10:54.400]  that's already been planned as it's being rolled out. And so it's all being announced.
[10:54.400 --> 11:00.480]  And at first, oh, just conform, support transgenderism, support sexualization of children, don't
[11:00.480 --> 11:06.400]  criticize vaccines, don't support Trump, don't support the Second Amendment. That's just
[11:06.400 --> 11:12.320]  what you've got to do today to conform. But it's always more, more, more. See, that's
[11:12.320 --> 11:21.840]  the thing about a noose is it gets tightened around your neck. And so you need to know
[11:21.840 --> 11:28.480]  who the social engineers are and where they're really taking you. They're waging war on logic,
[11:28.480 --> 11:35.120]  reason and common sense because what they're selling post human nightmare dystopia is so
[11:35.120 --> 11:42.000]  horrible that they need you psychologically and spiritually demoralized and sabotaged
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.920]  so that you can't even have any hope of knowing which end is up. You're being stunned like
[11:48.920 --> 11:54.720]  a spider does before it ties up its prey and lets it slowly liquefy for a few days before
[11:54.720 --> 12:01.720]  it sucks you dry. Now describe this as how most spiders species operate. It's how the
[12:01.720 --> 12:06.800]  globalists operate. So I liken them, their spirit animal to being a spider. The center
[12:06.800 --> 12:14.360]  of that web down that dark hole, spider will grab a fly, put enough venom into it to paralyze
[12:14.360 --> 12:21.240]  it, tie it up. And then it'll come and inject more venom to begin liquefying and it'll come
[12:21.240 --> 12:26.920]  over and put it's one, one of its eight legs on the fly or on whatever the insect is and
[12:26.920 --> 12:33.360]  feel for the heartbeat. And it waits right to the moment that the heart is stopping and
[12:33.360 --> 12:47.120]  the soul is leaving. That hand goes. Delicious. And that's exactly how Satan operates. Once
[12:47.120 --> 12:53.240]  you down on your knees, paralyzed, destroyed, when it lowers itself down in the dark and
[12:53.240 --> 13:04.360]  comes and looks at you with its eight eyes and says, no one's coming to save you. So
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.640]  they tie you down with the political correctness first. You're like, oh, these webs aren't
[13:09.640 --> 13:14.120]  that bad. I can still do stuff with these on me. Plus that spider is scary over there
[13:14.120 --> 13:18.400]  in the corner. I can see its eyes glinting in the dark. I don't want to have it come
[13:18.400 --> 13:26.320]  and eat me now. I'm going to let it eat me later. And that's what takes us to this point.
[13:26.320 --> 13:34.240]  The best intelligence, real human intelligence is on the ground. And it's when you drive
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.600]  into a town and you see four or five restaurants and you see the one that's got the parking
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.360]  lot full of cars and people coming out, giving each other high fives and the chimneys got
[13:44.360 --> 13:50.520]  smoke coming out of it. You smell good cooking red meat. You see other ones got a few cars.
[13:50.520 --> 13:55.600]  One has to be one car. You don't go in the place that has one car. You go in the place
[13:55.600 --> 14:01.480]  that's full because you know the knowledge of the crowd. You don't know that town, but
[14:01.480 --> 14:09.840]  you know people and they want good food and they want good prices. So see, I don't need
[14:09.840 --> 14:15.080]  to read secret government documents or think tank reports. I can watch how they operate.
[14:15.080 --> 14:18.360]  Not what they say, but what they do. And I know exactly what they're doing. Well, it
[14:18.360 --> 14:22.200]  turns out there are a couple big white papers that just came out that I read this morning
[14:22.200 --> 14:27.400]  that I'm going to cover when we come back, where they describe the whole plan to take
[14:27.400 --> 14:32.440]  over the Internet and censor everybody and how they plan to only take a few people out
[14:32.440 --> 14:37.720]  at first and have you not stand up for them and then take everybody off in the end. Now,
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.760]  you've already seen this happen. We already know that's what they're doing. But here they
[14:40.760 --> 14:46.320]  are admitting it's not about their made up hate speech. It's not about them carrying.
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.920]  It's about total control and it's major U.S. universities doing it. And President Trump
[14:53.920 --> 15:01.320]  knows that Georgetown University and George Washington University and Berkeley and Stanford
[15:01.320 --> 15:07.200]  and Harvard and Yale and the University of Texas and the list goes on are working around
[15:07.200 --> 15:12.520]  the clock to gag Americans and to set up a system of bullying and control where you're
[15:12.520 --> 15:17.760]  going to have your bank accounts, everything taken once they get control, but by approximation
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.320]  and they admit it all. Talk about a criminal dossier or the plan that you blows out of
[15:22.320 --> 15:26.440]  the back of a car that bank robbers are going to hit the bank next week. You know, you've
[15:26.440 --> 15:38.880]  got it. We've got the very blueprint of their plan and we can meet them. The question is,
[15:38.880 --> 15:44.160]  do you want to realize the plan and realize their manipulation and then overpower it by
[15:44.160 --> 15:50.720]  simply not following it? Or do you want to get down on your knees and let that spider
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.320]  come and have its way with you? As for me, I'm going to pull my sword and I'm going to
[15:55.320 --> 16:00.560]  go with that spider in the dark and out the hell out of it now. I'm here with Scott. You
[16:00.560 --> 16:05.560]  see him founder of OMG tax. Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who
[16:05.560 --> 16:11.640]  have a problem with the IRS. My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove
[16:11.640 --> 16:15.800]  wage garnish and sometimes in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt. Some
[16:15.800 --> 16:19.840]  of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise. Can you
[16:19.840 --> 16:27.120]  give us an example of somebody you help? Can I ever? We have taken a $500,000 liability
[16:27.120 --> 16:32.320]  with the IRS. Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known
[16:32.320 --> 16:37.640]  as non-collectible status with the government. If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you
[16:37.640 --> 16:43.640]  want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG tax right now for a free tax
[16:43.640 --> 16:59.600]  saving consultation. Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112. If you are trying
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.440]  to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and we'll
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.840]  never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little too much
[17:09.840 --> 17:15.960]  until it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my
[17:15.960 --> 17:21.000]  problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.320]  problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[17:27.320 --> 17:32.040]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.520]  and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire
[17:37.520 --> 17:43.920]  program may be covered. Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call

[18:00.520 --> 18:05.520]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world. A lot of people that never deliver.
[18:05.520 --> 18:13.480]  Well, I'm here to tell you, M4 Wars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades
[18:13.480 --> 18:18.240]  because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at
[18:18.240 --> 18:24.400]  M4 Wars. And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen. So right now, humanity's awakening,
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.080]  it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible. But there's major obstacles coming down the
[18:29.080 --> 18:34.560]  road and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on M4 Wars is
[18:34.560 --> 18:39.040]  to tip the spear. As your financial support, we make it really easy at M4WarsStore.com.
[18:39.040 --> 18:45.080]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now with our reporters doing triple
[18:45.080 --> 18:49.080]  the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it. And Owen and the rest of the crew
[18:49.080 --> 18:54.080]  will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during this election year that's so critical, but
[18:54.080 --> 18:59.080]  they need the financing to put them in the field. Go to M4WarsStore.com and fight for
[18:59.080 --> 19:05.080]  your own future. This should really be easier than it is. I'm
[19:05.080 --> 19:10.840]  not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out the way forward. Things that I've discovered
[19:10.840 --> 19:16.440]  that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will
[19:16.440 --> 19:23.680]  see how amazing it is. And then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[19:23.680 --> 19:30.080]  and will help us and it's symbiotic. My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because
[19:30.080 --> 19:35.000]  it's the good halogen, fluoride is the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.480]  and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like 8 years
[19:40.480 --> 19:48.000]  ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in StockX2, 40%
[19:48.000 --> 19:54.440]  off right now at M4WarsStore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it. It's amazing. Discover
[19:54.440 --> 20:22.240]  the benefits and it funds the M4, a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[20:24.440 --> 20:35.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from the M4Wars.com
[20:35.480 --> 20:47.840]  studios, it's Alex Jones. Raising the alarm, exposing the post human technology plan and
[20:47.840 --> 20:57.840]  as the days get darker, as we enter the storm, humanity will fully awaken and we will overcome.
[20:57.840 --> 21:07.840]  The question is, how rough is it going to be first? Thank you for joining us.
[21:07.840 --> 21:13.680]  All right, we know they're setting up a global social credit score and we know that Big Tech
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.040]  has moved to China and is aligned with the authoritarians there but also the authoritarians
[21:18.040 --> 21:26.600]  here that set up Communist China as this incubation facility for tyranny, animal, human, cloning,
[21:26.600 --> 21:31.240]  unlimited death torture, killing of Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, anybody who believes in
[21:31.240 --> 21:44.320]  God, just a true dehumanization prison. But now, Twitter, if the leader of the Senate
[21:44.320 --> 21:47.840]  says, hey, people are at my house saying kill me, it's terrible, here's a link to the video,
[21:47.840 --> 21:52.240]  Twitter please do something, they just suspend Mitch McConnell's Twitter and let the people
[21:52.240 --> 21:58.120]  that are at his house saying we're going to murder you and stab you in the heart, do it.
[21:58.120 --> 22:04.280]  That's reeducation camp, where people that attack other prisoners in the camp, they get
[22:04.280 --> 22:09.880]  food, they get promoted, those that say it's wrong, they get tortured to death. America
[22:09.880 --> 22:15.000]  is now a giant open air reeducation camp. Oh, it's private companies, it has nothing
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.800]  to do with it. 90 plus percent of the Internet is now those four companies and now they're
[22:19.800 --> 22:25.160]  working with banks and the ADL, the Southern Property Law Center, to openly say you don't
[22:25.160 --> 22:31.960]  tow the line, you criticize Bloomberg, you're a senator, Ted Cruz. You say look, Bloomberg's
[22:31.960 --> 22:39.840]  own publication says vote for him. That's campaign finance manipulation. And the head
[22:39.840 --> 22:49.000]  of the ADL says you are an anti-Semite. Using that against Ted Cruz who's pro-Israel, but
[22:49.000 --> 22:56.440]  that's what the left is doing. And now, Rick Wall's true news, very mild criticism of Christian
[22:56.440 --> 23:03.480]  Zionism and stuff like that, that's banned. But the head of the ADL made a special thing,
[23:03.480 --> 23:12.520]  Nick Fuentes banned. Very, very mild stuff compared to the racial stuff, the left spews.
[23:12.520 --> 23:20.200]  It doesn't matter. The point is now it's everybody. And so Twitter is testing new ways to fight
[23:20.200 --> 23:27.320]  misinformation, including a community-based point system. So see, in Nazi Germany, if
[23:27.320 --> 23:32.040]  you were a group the Nazis didn't like, you had to wear different things. Jews had to
[23:32.040 --> 23:39.040]  wear yellow stars. But now the left and the ADL under the head of it said, I'll play
[23:39.040 --> 23:44.680]  Eclipse in a moment when their spokesperson said everything must go through us. And they
[23:44.680 --> 23:50.880]  even called for Zuckerberg's arrest saying he hasn't let us run his company. I've never
[23:50.880 --> 23:55.480]  heard of such authoritarianism. And then the Jerusalem Post came out and said white nationalist
[23:55.480 --> 24:00.160]  Nick Fuentes banned. He's not even a white nationalist. He thinks bashing white people
[24:00.160 --> 24:06.960]  is wrong. But did the Jerusalem Post write about Israel? Having laws against Jews marrying
[24:06.960 --> 24:11.480]  non-Jews, I mean, if there's any place in the world has race mixing laws, it's Israel.
[24:11.480 --> 24:16.840]  Hey, I believe groups have a right to countries and a group to be homogeneous if they want.
[24:16.840 --> 24:22.840]  Only other country probably more homogeneous is China than Israel. If Chinese want to be
[24:22.840 --> 24:27.560]  Chinese, that's their issue. All I'm saying is this idea that if you're white and you're
[24:27.560 --> 24:32.600]  bad, well, the Jews are white, most of them, as you got some Africans. I mean, again, this
[24:32.600 --> 24:41.440]  is the weird juxtaposed world that the head of the ADL and others think we're so stupid.
[24:41.440 --> 24:48.480]  Jonathan Greenblatt. When did Jonathan Greenblatt do an ADL story about Israel having laws that
[24:48.480 --> 24:54.560]  if someone is in the country working and they're not a Jew, they can't date a Jew? I mean,
[24:54.560 --> 25:00.920]  last time I heard that Hitler had a law that if you weren't an Aryan, you couldn't date
[25:00.920 --> 25:07.160]  an Aryan or marry one. Arnold Schwarzenegger's brother was a product. Arnold was born after
[25:07.160 --> 25:15.360]  World War II, but his brother, who died in a car wreck, he was an approved SS marriage,
[25:15.360 --> 25:22.160]  approved SS baby. So Austria and Germany, they had approved marriages there. Well, Israel
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.600]  has approved state marriages. I'm not even an enemy of Israel. I'm just saying Greenblatt
[25:28.600 --> 25:34.440]  can't have it, the K can eat it too. Dick Point says, man, whites are getting targeted.
[25:34.440 --> 25:38.080]  There's days at colleges that whites can't be on the campus. We're being told we're
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.520]  inherently bad. That sounds like the opposite of Martin Luther King, Jr. And Greenblatt's
[25:42.520 --> 25:47.360]  running around going, I want him off the air right now. I want Alex Jones. In fact, at
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.600]  their ADL summit, they just said, I'm the public enemy number one. Hell, they say I'm
[25:52.600 --> 26:02.040]  an anti-Semite. Does Greenblatt really speak for Jews? No, not the Jews. I know. What an
[26:02.040 --> 26:07.600]  authoritarian. What a monster. But let's see, Twitter now is literally run by the ADL, Southern
[26:07.600 --> 26:12.240]  Poverty Law Center and Media Matters. They have a consortium and they tell you what you
[26:12.240 --> 26:25.400]  can and can't say. Meanwhile, the left pro-HIV California Senator wants to exempt LGBT pedophiles
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.760]  saying that if it's a gay sex with a child, it's okay. Then they, by the way, they passed
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.240]  the law. You can spread HIV and kill people. You don't get in trouble in California. It's
[26:34.240 --> 26:40.640]  called a gift. Gift givers, gift receivers. It's a holy sacrament of the Satanist. I'm
[26:40.640 --> 26:43.800]  not kidding. You can't make this up. And again, I'll probably have the ADL attack me because
[26:43.800 --> 26:48.320]  I don't want people with HIV to give blood. They literally say, no, we're going to give
[26:48.320 --> 26:55.520]  blood, too, and you're going to take it. You're going to take that gift. I'm not making this
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.000]  up, folks. You can't make this up. So it's all here. And so people think there's another
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.720]  white paper. That's what I was mentioning. Leftist study calls for banning small clusters
[27:05.720 --> 27:11.240]  of right wing thought criminals to avoid inflaming the entire hive. And the study breaks down
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.520]  how to do it incrementally so they don't resist so that when one gets banned, others won't
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.680]  defend them, hoping that they won't get banned. Well, that's what they did to us and everybody
[27:20.680 --> 27:24.840]  else. People said, oh, how, oh, Alex, how are you taking? I said they're coming for you.
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.160]  We need to band together and say no to this and follow lawsuits and speak out and have
[27:29.160 --> 27:33.320]  Trump take action and Congress take action. And we need to do something. They're coming
[27:33.320 --> 27:37.200]  after everybody. But see, others are like, oh, we better not promote that person now
[27:37.200 --> 27:41.560]  or this person, their band, and the list gets bigger and bigger. And then when you get banned,
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.240]  there's no one left to stand up for you. Remember the thing from Nazi Germany? First, they came
[27:45.240 --> 27:47.960]  for this group. I wasn't part of that group. So I didn't do anything. Then they came for
[27:47.960 --> 27:51.040]  this group. And I wasn't part of that group. So I didn't do anything. Then they came for
[27:51.040 --> 27:56.160]  that group. And I wasn't that group. Finally, they came for me. There was nobody left. This
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.440]  is a formula. And we have major university papers on how they're doing it. But we know
[28:01.440 --> 28:08.200]  they're already doing it. And then now Senator Cruz is evil, because he doesn't like Bloomberg's
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.520]  plan to take the guns. And because Bloomberg happens to be Jewish, we just have to say,
[28:12.520 --> 28:16.760]  well, you know, obviously, Senator Cruz has got to be arrested. I mean, he talked about
[28:16.760 --> 28:23.480]  someone that is above the law. This is bizarre. This is the left using America that defeated
[28:23.480 --> 28:31.280]  the Nazis to then project on us that we're Nazis so that we must bow. Or we're the ones
[28:31.280 --> 28:39.120]  who are the Nazis. Just unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, but that's where all this is
[28:39.120 --> 28:43.600]  going. So when we come back, I'm going to play some clips of the ADL celebrating this
[28:43.600 --> 28:50.240]  reign of terror and evil over America. Corruption has come. Evil has come. Oppression has come.
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.320]  The annihilation of all that our First Amendment America stands for is here. Will you band
[28:55.320 --> 29:01.880]  together and say no or be taken out? One at a time, fellow patriots. My name is Todd
[29:01.880 --> 29:06.240]  Savage, founder of black rifle real estate dot com. Like you, I was a prisoner of the
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.800]  out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom. Today we live
[29:10.800 --> 29:15.640]  on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children
[29:15.640 --> 29:19.320]  without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us. If you're ready to flee the city
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.840]  to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our black rifle real estate team is here to help go
[29:23.840 --> 29:29.480]  to black rifle real estate dot com. That's black rifle real estate dot com. Hunters,

[29:58.080 --> 30:06.120]  All right, folks, here's the bad news. We've already sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle
[30:06.120 --> 30:10.600]  with the patented nano tech silver that's documented to knock out viruses and bacteria
[30:10.600 --> 30:15.320]  unlike anything else. But we do still have it in the three ounce in the one ounce for
[30:15.320 --> 30:21.400]  limited time. The good news is we have the super blue toothpaste and the super silver
[30:21.400 --> 30:26.520]  toothpaste both that have the nano silver in them as well. The super blue has tea tree
[30:26.520 --> 30:31.320]  that's also antiviral and antibacterial and high quality iodine. And then of course the
[30:31.320 --> 30:35.920]  whitening has the nano silver. But on top of that, it has the above sea coral calcium
[30:35.920 --> 30:40.760]  that remelanorizes the teeth. And so it's just the best toothpaste you're going to find.
[30:40.760 --> 30:44.920]  Period. It has the nano silver and we still have supplies of it though it'll sell out
[30:44.920 --> 30:50.600]  at current rates in about two weeks. But despite that, I'm keeping it at sale at 50% off so
[30:50.600 --> 30:54.120]  everybody can protect themselves with this high quality product. You've never used it
[30:54.120 --> 31:02.840]  before. Get yours today infowarstore.com infowarstore.com real stuff, man. We're talking about the
[31:02.840 --> 31:06.800]  real deal here and I love Trump all day long. But man, I tell you, he sits there and lets
[31:06.800 --> 31:11.800]  these big tech people keep running rough shot over him. Everybody I mean, I've got a problem
[31:11.800 --> 31:15.520]  and we'll just take the Trump rallies over. That said, about two months ago, I came with
[31:15.520 --> 31:20.160]  a plan that I haven't launched yet. We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands
[31:20.160 --> 31:25.160]  of stickers, 20 different stickers, impeach the Democrats, save the second amendment,
[31:25.160 --> 31:29.200]  defend the first amendment infowarstore.com. And it looks like duct tape, but it's just
[31:29.200 --> 31:32.680]  a regular sticker. You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally and you instantly
[31:32.680 --> 31:36.200]  take over without even disrupting things. People say, why are you doing this? What's
[31:36.200 --> 31:40.440]  happening when you go? Well, we're being censored. You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[31:40.440 --> 31:43.640]  And Dr. Pachennick, let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet.
[31:43.640 --> 31:49.800]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence
[31:49.800 --> 31:55.200]  and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all silence. And you know what's
[31:55.200 --> 32:00.320]  most disturbing to people? Silence. Silence.
[32:00.320 --> 32:04.520]  Since the beginning, secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas. Now we're bringing

[33:03.520 --> 33:25.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming
[33:25.040 --> 33:36.120]  to you live from the front lines of the Info War. So the head of the Anti-Defamation League
[33:36.120 --> 33:40.700]  has jumped the shark and come out and said Ted Cruz is an anti-Semite. We're pointing
[33:40.700 --> 33:45.440]  out that Bloomberg has spent $500 million buying up the media and has Bloomberg his
[33:45.440 --> 33:50.840]  own publication with his name on it, propagandizing for him, violating campaign finance reform.
[33:50.840 --> 33:53.880]  I know when I was going to run for Congress 20 years ago, they said, you got to quit your
[33:53.880 --> 33:57.760]  radio show because you can't have your own media all when you run for Congress. I said,
[33:57.760 --> 34:00.880]  well, then I'm not going to do it. That was in the newspapers at the time. I said, well,
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.200]  I'm not going to do it. I just follow the paperwork. But oh, that's anti-Semitic. Well,
[34:05.200 --> 34:10.320]  now look at these headlines. Twitter is testing new ways to fight misinformation, including
[34:10.320 --> 34:16.720]  a community-based point system where the community of leftist vote only trusted communists and
[34:16.720 --> 34:21.800]  then you get flagged and then you get banned by the community. Oh, Twitter didn't do it.
[34:21.800 --> 34:28.000]  That's the Communist Chinese social score. Look at this one. UK racist sexist may be
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.520]  denied healthcare. They're going to look at what you say and do online. You pay into the
[34:31.520 --> 34:35.440]  national healthcare, but now you're not going to get the healthcare. That's your social
[34:35.440 --> 34:41.280]  credit score. Here's another one. Rapper denied entry to Planet Fitness for questioning transgender
[34:41.280 --> 34:46.480]  children in a rap song. How dare you say we shouldn't target children with chemicals
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.520]  that destroy them? Oh, no. How dare you? Well, now Planet Fitness is watching what you say
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.560]  and part of these databases with the Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL, you can't come
[34:55.560 --> 35:02.200]  in. So that's where all of this is coming from. And here's another one. Leftist study
[35:02.200 --> 35:07.560]  calls for banning small clusters of right-wing thought criminals to avoid inflaming entire
[35:07.560 --> 35:13.160]  hive. Here is the actual report. We already knew they were doing this. This is the plant
[35:13.160 --> 35:18.360]  banned people incrementally so others don't stand up for them so that no one ever unifies
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.640]  and then that way they can pick us off one at a time. And everyone's done a great job
[35:21.640 --> 35:26.480]  of laying down to it and going along with it. That's in the Journal of Nature right there
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.040]  for you. Mike Adams didn't back down. Matt Drudge supported us during the ban. We appreciate
[35:31.040 --> 35:35.520]  Matt Drudge. Most other people just put their tails between their legs and crapped all over
[35:35.520 --> 35:42.080]  themselves. YouTube bans Christian broadcaster true news for hate speech. Of course, Nick
[35:42.080 --> 35:50.480]  Fuentes has been banned as well. So this is the reign of terror, but the key here is they
[35:50.480 --> 35:56.720]  admit the major university studies. Georgetown, George Washington University, we've got them
[35:56.720 --> 36:07.920]  right here, that they are targeting people incrementally so that you don't stand up for
[36:07.920 --> 36:13.960]  them and then you're next. And they have a whole battle plan to ban millions of people.
[36:13.960 --> 36:17.200]  And it's already happening. They're shadow batting. They're suppressing you. AI is watching
[36:17.200 --> 36:21.960]  you. And that's why Trump has failed so miserably on this front. It's not private companies
[36:21.960 --> 36:26.920]  just doing what they want. It's AI. It's ADL. Southern Probably Law Center hired in
[36:26.920 --> 36:30.920]  mass to go into interfaces and even read your private messages. I first told you that a
[36:30.920 --> 36:35.920]  year ago. Now it's mainstream news. Jordan Peterson videos, Alex Jones videos privately
[36:35.920 --> 36:41.720]  sent on WhatsApp on Facebook and others are banned because they're reading what you do.
[36:41.720 --> 36:46.720]  Machines flag it. And then an ADL Southern Probably Law Center trained spy looks into
[36:46.720 --> 36:52.360]  your private messages. You're pissed at the NSA, read your messages, right? This is the
[36:52.360 --> 36:56.080]  ADL and Southern Probably Law Center and media matters. And they're even running education
[36:56.080 --> 37:00.080]  in the public schools. Let's play a few of these clips that Mike Adams has huge breaking
[37:00.080 --> 37:06.480]  news. We're gonna go to him. But here is anti-semitic conspiracy theories censored with AI algorithm
[37:06.480 --> 37:10.880]  says ADL. But then we're going to play a clip of sauce for a Cohen. There's spokesperson
[37:10.880 --> 37:16.360]  at the ADL meeting three months ago saying, we're gonna arrest tech heads that don't do
[37:16.360 --> 37:24.120]  what we say. Wow, you do what we say, or we're going to arrest you. That doesn't sound scary
[37:24.120 --> 37:30.240]  or authoritarian does it. But that's where we are the battle over who controls the AI
[37:30.240 --> 37:37.360]  now. And the groups threatening each other. This is so dangerous. It's not just an American.
[37:37.360 --> 37:43.720]  So here is the head of the ADL who just attacked Ted Cruz's anti-semitic yesterday celebrating
[37:43.720 --> 37:50.160]  true news and others being taken off YouTube. Here it is. We work with with Google on using
[37:50.160 --> 37:56.520]  AI to try to interrupt cyber hate before it happens. We work with YouTube to get them
[37:56.520 --> 38:00.720]  to change their algorithms. So it lessens the likelihood that a young person is going
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.480]  to run into some of these anti-semitic conspiratorial videos. We work with Facebook on trying to
[38:06.480 --> 38:12.880]  use a redirect method. So when you search for Holocaust as a hoax, you get directed to
[38:12.880 --> 38:18.920]  like a Yad Vashem page. So there are different ways they can tweak their algorithms and adjust
[38:18.920 --> 38:25.280]  their products. So they think not only about free speech, not only protect a user's right
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.600]  to free speech, but protect a user's right to not be harassed or hated. They have done
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.680]  some good things to deal with very specific cases by taking swift reaction when people
[38:35.680 --> 38:42.880]  perpetrate online bullying or online harassment. So you have a right to not see this. By the
[38:42.880 --> 38:47.040]  way, Hitler killed a bunch of Jews. I'm not denying that. But if a crazy person wants
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.080]  to sit there and say that, that's their right. Let's see, there's no end to this. Now it's
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.040]  Ted Cruz. He criticized Bloomberg. Well, I guess all the other people on the stage, including
[38:54.040 --> 38:59.680]  Bernie Sanders or anti-semitic, because they tore Bloomberg a new butthole, excuse my French.
[38:59.680 --> 39:01.920]  We got Mike Adams with us a little bit in the next hour. We're going to him in a moment
[39:01.920 --> 39:07.440]  with huge news. Let me just finish up with this. Here's Sacha Baron Cohen on Yours Truly,
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.480]  Speaking from the ADL script at the ADL's national function.
[39:10.480 --> 39:17.360]  And that trigger outrage and fear. It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist
[39:17.360 --> 39:25.040]  Alex Jones billions of times. It's why fake news outperforms real news because studies
[39:25.040 --> 39:30.880]  show that lies spread faster than truth. And it's no surprise that the greatest propaganda
[39:30.880 --> 39:36.880]  machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history, the lie that
[39:36.880 --> 39:43.640]  Jews are somehow dangerous. As one headline put it, just think what Goebbels could have
[39:43.640 --> 39:52.520]  done with Facebook. On the internet, everything can appear equally legitimate. Breitbart resembles
[39:52.520 --> 40:00.760]  the BBC. The fictitious protocols of the Elders of Zion look as valid as an ADL report.
[40:00.760 --> 40:06.280]  You know, I'm going to say something. I think Rosenblatt and Sacha Baron Cohen have Aspergers,
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.800]  which is a trait of people that are highly intelligent. And the British royal family
[40:10.800 --> 40:16.400]  has it, but it's in Brady. I mean, these poor guys just don't get it. They're saying we're
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.080]  coming for your speech. We're going to get you. The left saying white people are bad.
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.520]  Get them. And then we see people like Cohen and Rosenblatt promoting it. And I've been
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.080]  pro-Israel. I believe Israel has the right to exist. I know a lot of nice Jews that don't
[40:29.080 --> 40:33.280]  agree with this. And I get that Israel has been under attack. That doesn't give Cohen
[40:33.280 --> 40:39.040]  and Greenblatt the right to then say, I'm an anti-Semite on national television when
[40:39.040 --> 40:43.160]  it's like they're saying you're going to be an anti-Semite. You're going to attack us.
[40:43.160 --> 40:49.640]  So when you do, we'll get a bunch of money from Jews.
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.120]  You know, I don't think Rosenblatt or Cohen's grandfathers fought Hitler and almost both
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.320]  died. I almost don't exist because of Hitler. I know Hitler was bad, but that doesn't mean
[40:57.320 --> 41:04.040]  these guys are good. They're dangerous and they're sick. And there's something's wrong
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.480]  with these guys. They don't represent Jews. And Jews even let them know they don't represent
[41:07.480 --> 41:12.480]  Jews because that's crazy talk. You just heard him say that I'm the learned elders
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.960]  of Zion crap. Let's play some more clips. He goes on to say if you believe in replacement
[41:17.960 --> 41:21.560]  migration, it's made up. You should be arrested. Let's play this one though. Here's, he says,
[41:21.560 --> 41:28.400]  we need a purge. Here he is about purging. There is such a thing as objective truth.
[41:28.400 --> 41:34.960]  Facts do exist. And if these internet companies really want to make a difference, they should
[41:34.960 --> 41:42.800]  hire enough monitors to actually monitor. Work closely with groups like the ADL and the NAACP
[41:42.800 --> 41:51.360]  insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms. Purge means pogrom.
[41:51.360 --> 41:58.440]  Okay. Well, thank you. You want to purge me? Thank you. Take people's health care away.
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.720]  That's what the ADL's pushing for in England. Just let me die. Kill me. Okay. I deserve
[42:02.720 --> 42:06.440]  it. I'm white. Kill me. I'm sorry. Sasha, you're superior to me. I bow to you. You're
[42:06.440 --> 42:11.160]  my king. What do I have to do? I worship you. I worship you. You're superior to me. Here's
[42:11.160 --> 42:14.960]  another one. Sasha Barrett Cohen. Arrest them. Let's play this clip.
[42:14.960 --> 42:22.800]  And maybe fines are not enough. Maybe it's time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs
[42:22.800 --> 42:30.080]  of these companies you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections.
[42:30.080 --> 42:39.360]  You already facilitated one genocide in Myanmar. Do it again and you go to jail. Do it again.
[42:39.360 --> 42:44.040]  You go to jail. How many Muslims of live stream killing people all the time? They never hear
[42:44.040 --> 42:47.960]  about it because it's just covered up. And Zuckerberg censored massively. It's not enough.
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.880]  Cohen is telling Zuckerberg, you give me that now. But it's not really him. It's Rosenblatt.
[42:52.880 --> 42:59.440]  Rosenblatt's literally like Dr. Evil even looks like him. He's Hitler.
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.920]  Before I started working at Info Wars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Info Wars.com,
[43:04.920 --> 43:09.360]  but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com. And there's one product that's offered at
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.800]  InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements. And that's DNA Force Plus. Now,
[43:14.800 --> 43:18.160]  I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[43:18.160 --> 43:24.360]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA. So I started to look into the science and what
[43:24.360 --> 43:30.880]  telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[43:30.880 --> 43:36.320]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an elite
[43:36.320 --> 43:41.400]  supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements
[43:41.400 --> 43:48.240]  for telomere support and they came and they went. But DNA Force Plus is still there. It is the
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.080]  elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[43:53.080 --> 43:58.920]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:58.920 --> 44:06.720]  There can no longer be any doubt. This coronavirus is serious on multiple levels. It's very
[44:06.720 --> 44:12.280]  communicable. It spreads very, very fast. It is killing a lot of people. And the Chinese
[44:12.280 --> 44:16.880]  Communist government has covered up just how bad it is. And the Lighthouse is now openly
[44:16.880 --> 44:24.080]  challenging them, show our Trump's top scientist. And so is Senator Cotton. My friends, now is the
[44:24.080 --> 44:30.480]  time to get prepared. 2020 is not a year to play games with. The globalists are trying to create
[44:30.480 --> 44:36.320]  economic collapse, race riots. We don't know how bad this virus is going to get here. That's why
[44:36.320 --> 44:42.960]  listeners to InfoWars need to be prepared. And InfoWarsStore.com has the products that make
[44:42.960 --> 44:48.400]  your life better and make you healthier. We have the last of the immune gargle selling out as we

[46:00.800 --> 46:05.360]  We know that the globalists are in trouble. Humanity is waking up to their tyranny,
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.880]  how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world. But we know
[46:10.880 --> 46:16.160]  they're going to strike back. And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode
[46:16.160 --> 46:22.000]  third-world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.680]  and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant cloud and pivot program.
[46:27.680 --> 46:33.600]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government
[46:33.600 --> 46:40.560]  inner coronavirus. This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to
[46:40.560 --> 46:46.160]  be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before. But this fight against
[46:46.160 --> 46:52.880]  tyranny is neck and neck. So spread the word about band.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[46:52.880 --> 47:11.200]  That is so important. You are at the center of the resistance. You are our only hope.
[47:22.880 --> 47:39.120]  So there's a major fight going on worldwide over who controls the internet and who gets
[47:39.120 --> 47:44.240]  to censor what instead of saying, hey, we don't censor. It's a major capitulation of the West
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.600]  and our values. It'll leave the destruction of humanity. We don't turn it around. It's why I've
[47:49.600 --> 47:59.360]  launched Operation Win2020.com and more than 3,000 people have gone to Operation Win2020.com
[47:59.360 --> 48:08.160]  and signed up to get sent 20 free bumper stickers that cover the mouth and save the First Amendment.
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.360]  You go to a Trump event with this song. People are going to say, why are you doing that? Well,
[48:15.360 --> 48:19.440]  then you pull it off and talk to them about it. It really is a great conversational starter.
[48:20.400 --> 48:26.000]  And we're also putting a bunch of 20 free stickers in every order at infowars.com. But
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.480]  whatever you do, please on your email, please on your private text messages while you still
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.640]  can. They're now censoring those. Outrageous. Imagine if the NSA did that. Share the link.
[48:36.640 --> 48:49.040]  infowarsstore.com or triple 825-33139, triple 825-33139. You can call and we will also send you
[48:49.040 --> 48:55.360]  a pack of 20 stickers free. You can buy 100 pack that cost a 500 pack or a 1,000 pack as well.
[48:55.920 --> 49:00.000]  And please don't forget we have high quality swirble food in stock. It takes 10 to 14 days to
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.040]  deliver it because they got a package that they're working 24 hours a day. Most of the other food
[49:03.040 --> 49:08.320]  suppliers have already sold out or selling old crap. The food orders are going up, not down.
[49:08.320 --> 49:14.080]  It's pretty frightening. And to join us now, the next three segments is Mike Adams of naturalnews.com
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.560]  who along with Dr. Francis Boyle, the author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law and World Treaty
[49:19.280 --> 49:25.200]  has been at the very tip of the spear. Again, you revise your assessments as you learn more.
[49:25.200 --> 49:30.560]  We've never revised that it was manmade. We've never revised that it was released.
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.920]  But we've looked at, was it Canada where they were working on a weaponized version of it? Was
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.040]  it stolen by this Chinese operative who now died mysteriously? Well, it turns out hiding in plain
[49:41.040 --> 49:49.360]  view, and we had Dr. Boyle on about this yesterday. Lab made coronavirus triggers debate. This is
[49:49.360 --> 49:58.800]  the scientist major journal November 2015 pointing out that a U.S. university produced the exact
[49:58.800 --> 50:04.720]  virus, a chimera that we're now dealing with. And that's why other groups, Indian research facilities
[50:04.720 --> 50:08.960]  and others universities have come out and said this is edited. You can see where the gene editing
[50:08.960 --> 50:14.000]  happened. It's got the scars. It's got the points where it was put in. There's no debating.
[50:15.280 --> 50:21.760]  And so it's here. And so you've had Senator Cotton saying, stop the cover up. You've got the White
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.680]  House saying they want to know if China is covering it up. It turns out in 2015, China bought this
[50:25.680 --> 50:32.400]  from a U.S. university. It's all right here. And we have reports of U.S. government put a stop to
[50:32.400 --> 50:38.800]  all funding. And you have watchdog groups in mainline news saying don't do this. So now did the
[50:38.800 --> 50:44.880]  Chinese release it? Or like mouse pox number 20 years ago, internationally, mouse pox that will
[50:44.880 --> 50:54.880]  kill 98% of humans the way it's engineered. If it gets out between 90 and 98%. Scientists ask,
[50:54.880 --> 50:59.440]  why is the code to this being given out on the internet? Because the globalist are hoping
[50:59.440 --> 51:03.520]  that it gets proliferated to terrorist produces it, or they want plausible liability.
[51:03.520 --> 51:06.960]  That's what's happened. What do you do when there's fingerprints on all this? Well, you hand it out.
[51:08.880 --> 51:13.520]  That's what you do. You hand it out. So then no one knows where it came from. That's the only
[51:13.520 --> 51:18.880]  thing that this could be done for. So joining us is Mike Adams for the next 30 minutes or so, Mike.
[51:18.880 --> 51:24.880]  I appreciate your time. Looking at this, this is the smoking gun as Dr. Boyle said. We've been
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.720]  right about it manmade. We've been right about a cover up. We've been right about China using it
[51:28.720 --> 51:34.160]  as a crackdown. The cases are exploding. People are dying on the cruise ships. Definitely deadly.
[51:34.160 --> 51:39.520]  Definitely moving very fast. Spreads very easily, very communicable. The passage in.
[51:40.720 --> 51:44.480]  What is your best approximation now? Because we've been dead on with the knowledge we had.
[51:45.200 --> 51:48.320]  Looking at this university, looking at that university, but now we're honing in.
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.960]  What? What the hell's going on? Give me your main approximation, your main analysis,
[51:52.960 --> 51:59.520]  then we'll walk through the nuts and bolts of it. Well, for starters, we're all going to end up at
[51:59.520 --> 52:04.320]  risk. And many of us killed by government incompetence when it comes to these ministries of health,
[52:04.320 --> 52:08.480]  such as Japan's Ministry of Health that allowed thousands of potentially infected people to
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.840]  walk off the Diamond Princess cruise ship right into Tokyo and fly to dozens of major cities
[52:13.840 --> 52:20.080]  all around the world with no protection whatsoever. The US State Department under objections from the
[52:20.080 --> 52:25.360]  CDC just flew infected passengers back to the United States on a charter jet where those
[52:25.360 --> 52:30.640]  infected passengers shared the same airplane with non-infected passengers. And we just found out
[52:30.640 --> 52:38.480]  today that 11 more are now infected. They're in Omaha. So that's like 12 monkeys. I mean,
[52:38.480 --> 52:44.480]  literally creating incubation petri dishes. Yeah, basically, they slapped some plastic with duct
[52:44.480 --> 52:48.960]  tape in a section of the airplane and then pretended that was a quarantine. Well, look,
[52:48.960 --> 52:53.360]  the air on the airplane is circulated across all the seats, all the passengers, just like on the
[52:53.360 --> 52:58.080]  cruise ship, they're sharing the same air. And yet you've got so much government incompetence at this
[52:58.080 --> 53:03.040]  point where you have the Surgeon General of the state of Florida still insisting that this isn't
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.400]  airborne and refusing to release any numbers of how many have been tested in Florida, saying that
[53:08.400 --> 53:12.800]  they can't release that information. It's insane. Well, don't give it up to incompetence, Mike.
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.320]  We know that they refuse to send out the scan of the virus weeks ago so people couldn't tell
[53:16.320 --> 53:20.960]  where it came from. There's clearly a cover-up going on. Clearly a cover-up. And by the way,
[53:20.960 --> 53:26.000]  I had my staff meticulously transcribe your interview with Francis Boyle from yesterday or
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.560]  the day before. We've got the full text of that interview posted at Natural News right now,
[53:30.560 --> 53:35.840]  and everybody is free to copy and paste and share that full transcript. It's quite lengthy,
[53:35.840 --> 53:40.800]  but I've bolded the really important parts of that interview. I read through it twice. I listened
[53:40.800 --> 53:45.840]  to it. It was a bombshell interview. Most importantly, out of that interview, Francis Boyle
[53:45.840 --> 53:52.080]  is essentially accusing Dr. Fauci and the NIH of being war criminals engaged in biological weapons
[53:52.080 --> 53:56.720]  research against humanity. And that's right there in the interview. It's not me saying that.
[53:56.720 --> 54:00.960]  That's Francis Boyle warning about that. And as you know, he's called for the mass arrest
[54:00.960 --> 54:05.520]  of all these so-called scientists who are working on these biological weapons against humanity.
[54:05.520 --> 54:09.600]  And I have to concur with that. It's time to shut that down. And by the way,
[54:09.600 --> 54:14.960]  getting about censorship, the big text censorship, it goes hand in hand with this,
[54:14.960 --> 54:20.000]  where those of us who are proven accurate, who are telling the truth, who are one to two weeks
[54:20.000 --> 54:24.320]  ahead of the mainstream media, we are being censored, even though we are the ones helping
[54:24.320 --> 54:27.760]  people get prepared. Mike, Mike, Mike. You've been one month ahead. You've been one month ahead.
[54:28.480 --> 54:35.040]  Absolutely. Yeah, this whole time. You know it. But see, by censoring us and then highlighting
[54:35.040 --> 54:41.200]  the fake news media, the big tech giants are making sure that the world is unprepared for this.
[54:41.760 --> 54:45.760]  That's why I'm concerned. Everybody can feel it. I feel a sucker punch here.
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.880]  Well, look, I mean, this is going to get way worse because of the censorship. Right now,
[54:52.880 --> 54:58.480]  people all across America need to know that there are thousands of Americans who are under
[54:58.480 --> 55:05.840]  an observation by state authorities in the state of Washington alone. It's 779 people being observed
[55:05.840 --> 55:11.840]  by the state, basically being told to watch out for symptoms. But the state of Washington refuses
[55:11.840 --> 55:18.880]  to test more than 26 people. They've only tested 26 out of 779 numbers now. So give me your best
[55:18.880 --> 55:24.880]  approximation. Clearly, a lot of people are dying now. China covered it up. How bad because your
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.640]  approximations have been dead on? You've got resources in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and you're
[55:28.640 --> 55:33.440]  an engineer. You talk a lot of medical folks. Well, what's the real numbers? That's the approximation.
[55:33.440 --> 55:40.880]  Dead reckoning. Best guess right now in China, over 30,000 dead, over 300,000 infected, and probably
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.760]  hundreds dead outside of China, including the new deaths that have been reported in Iran,
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.560]  a new infection now confirmed in Lebanon. We've received rumors of over 20 deaths at a hospital
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.640]  that's got infections in Iran. Total coverup there, of course. There are deaths in Japan, in Taiwan,
[55:56.640 --> 56:01.200]  in Singapore. They're welding doors shut. They've got mass graves. They've got mass fires. They've
[56:01.200 --> 56:06.960]  got mobile cremation vans, all this confirmed. And you've been a month ahead on something. You were
[56:06.960 --> 56:12.160]  like a week ahead on the cremation vans and the cremation vehicles. It's just crazy how you're
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.880]  reporting it. We're reporting it. Zero hedge is doing a great job. And then we don't ever get
[56:16.880 --> 56:21.200]  celebrated. We get attacked because we told the truth. And by the way, animals are dropping dead
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.000]  everywhere all over China. And now we're learning Japan, South Korea. This could be the big one.
[56:26.720 --> 56:31.600]  South Korea exploded overnight, literally doubling the number of infections in one day.
[56:31.600 --> 56:36.720]  It's now over 200 infections in Korea. We're seeing exponential growth outside of China,
[56:36.720 --> 56:40.960]  even as China is fudging the numbers and trying to pretend that there are fewer infections.
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.360]  I mean, the moment doesn't make you drop dead or have a heart attack or be having convulsions.
[56:45.360 --> 56:50.000]  What the hell is this? Because it's like they say in the papers, it's so many different viruses
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.680]  from different animals together, and it's mutating like a super weapon. Yes. As Francis Boyle explained,
[56:55.680 --> 56:59.840]  this is a chimera from three different viruses. But look, the big news, and we got to get to this
[56:59.840 --> 57:06.800]  more after the coming break, but Dr. Anne Shucha from the CDC is now warning about a surge warning
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.560]  all US hospitals prepare for a surge in coronavirus patients in the United States of America.
[57:12.560 --> 57:17.680]  This is straight out of the CDC. It confirms what CDC director Dr. Redfield said the other day,
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.960]  and Dr. Nancy Messonnier also from the CDC said community outbreaks are coming in America.
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.240]  Hospitals had better get prepared. And Mike, let's add this. We're about to start the second hour.
[57:28.880 --> 57:32.480]  All right. What happened five weeks ago before we were really even focused on this,
[57:32.480 --> 57:37.440]  you were starting a report on it. We, you and I both, we got sustained hack attacks,
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.000]  fake bankruptcy filings, attempts to take down the side stuff we've never seen before by
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.800]  shadowy groups ahead of this. They tried to take us out ahead of this, which tells you something
[57:46.800 --> 57:53.600]  big is coming. With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural
[57:53.600 --> 58:00.160]  that it starts to crack and take damage. Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's
[58:00.160 --> 58:06.000]  time to start taking care of your skin. With the Infrawar super silver cream, you can keep your

[58:56.160 --> 59:02.560]  and world population control organizations. They openly had meetings and led by Julian Huxley,
[59:02.560 --> 59:10.000]  Aldous Huxley's brother, decided to repackage themselves as transhumanist. Now in the year 2020
[59:10.000 --> 59:16.880]  to set the precedent that people can be turned into cyborgs, that robots can be given rights,
[59:16.880 --> 59:23.840]  you name it. They are intimidating and arresting people all over the world who simply misgender
[59:23.840 --> 59:31.200]  someone. So the ultimate crime will be even asking what someone is if you can't even tell
[59:31.200 --> 59:36.960]  what they are. This is the ultimate Kafka-esque mind control and there's several big articles up
[59:36.960 --> 59:43.040]  on infowars.com that break this down. UK teen fine under house arrest for asking trans police
[59:43.040 --> 59:49.760]  officers gender UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay 1000 pound fine.
[59:49.760 --> 59:59.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:36.320]  Make no mistake. We are making the plunge into destiny in 2020. The anti human technocrats
[1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:41.200]  are moving on all fronts. We're still on air. Thanks to you. We're still fighting together
[1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:48.560]  for a pro human future. Here is the full transcript. It's on info wars.com and it's on
[1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:53.760]  natural news.com will also post it to news wars.com. That doesn't get censored as bad as
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:01:00.240]  natural news.com or info wars.com full transcript of smoking gun bombshell interview. Professor
[1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:06.880]  Francis Boyle exposes the bio weapons origins of the COVID-19 coronavirus. Absolutely amazing.
[1:01:06.880 --> 1:01:12.080]  So glad that Mike did that. That was historic interview. We should try to get Dr. Boyle on
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:16.240]  the Sunday show if we can or an emergency broadcast tomorrow. This is a short segment long
[1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:22.080]  segment coming up Mike. Get some stations don't carry this for five minutes. So let's give you
[1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:27.360]  your big announcements next segment. But all this is important on why what Boyle talked about so big.
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:32.240]  He just went and did research. It's hiding in plain view in the scientists and others five years ago
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:37.200]  saying what the hell are major universities doing selling China this exact time era. This is smoking
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:42.960]  gun. So then I asked the question Mike. Who's setting up who. Why did they do this now. Now
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:49.520]  why do you think it popped out. What's behind this. Well first of all it's clear that this was
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:54.400]  engineered as a weapon against humanity. As Professor Boyle said in the interview and I
[1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:59.760]  verified I purchased the full PDF of one of the papers that he was referring to. And sure enough
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:05.200]  in that paper it says that this this is designed to enhance human to human transmission to make it
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:10.240]  spread as quickly as possible. That's in the science paper. That's not even just a meta analysis
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:18.080]  that's in the paper. Furthermore this this class of beta Corona viruses has no lineage that links
[1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:23.520]  to this. In other words it's not a random mutation found in nature. Anything that you find in nature
[1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:29.360]  has a hierarchy kind of a viral family lineage. You know like a family tree that you can trace
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:34.800]  the different. It doesn't have a history. That's right. This is bred. This is created. This is
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:40.160]  engineered and and still in the mainstream media the lying to us about it. Now yes it was probably
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:45.680]  engineered by a variety of scientists in a number of labs around the world. We have a worldwide
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:50.800]  bio weapon engineered genetically engineered outbreak right now. That's right. Well that's
[1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:55.040]  right. They're building weapons against humanity and they got out. We don't know exactly how they
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:02:59.840]  got out. I think it was now released on purpose in China. Start over when we come back at some
[1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:04.400]  stations again. But obviously Xi Jinping's in trouble. He's been embarrassed. He wants to go
[1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:10.800]  into Taiwan. This is perfect time. Well yeah and they know this tends to kill the elderly and I've
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:15.680]  pointed out globally almost every nation every government is bankrupt unless they can find a
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:20.960]  way to kill off a lot of the elderly citizens who are collecting entitlements. You know I mean
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:26.080]  the only way to make the U.S. government solvent is to frankly eliminate most of the elderly who
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:32.080]  are collecting social security. This is definitely what Bloomberg says. He says to fix the Ponzi
[1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:40.560]  scheme because they inflated the money. Kill old people. Well BS man. Yeah and again this a virus
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:46.160]  cannot be traced exactly back to who who launched it. That's why they handed it out. Clearly why the
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:50.160]  hell would they sell this to China and others. That was under Obama because the globalist wanted
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:55.600]  to release this later. Oh and by the way it is true. You asked me about this. Is it race specific.
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:03:59.840]  My initial answer was I didn't have information at that time. I've done additional research.
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:05.680]  It's absolutely. It has a higher propensity for infectiousness and mortality in Asian people.
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:11.520]  There's no question about that now because of the ACE2 inhibitor and especially South Chinese Han
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:16.880]  people and Japanese people. In fact it's the most infectious in Japanese people which is
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.400]  right there. I'm going to give you the form and come back. All right. Race specific evidence.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:25.200]  The fact they admit it's manmade. The fact that it was cooked up in the U.S. University will go
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:29.200]  over the fact that it's been a bit controversial five years ago that they made this thing and
[1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:33.280]  then now Bill and Bill Gates have patented something along these lines for the vaccine.
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:39.840]  What is the big plan. We are smart enough to counter it. We together can defeat it.
[1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:44.800]  When this was all launching five weeks ago. We've never seen hack attacks. Denial of services.
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:48.640]  Then dirty tricks like it and everybody else I know got hit. Not just Mike Adams or Info Wars.
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:53.600]  You know a war starts when the artillery opens up on your ass. Stay with us.
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:05:04.480]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements. Ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion are both

[1:05:53.040 --> 1:06:09.920]  individually or 50 percent off when you get them together at infowarstore.com the answer to 1984
[1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:24.640]  is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I have been on air since 1995. That's 25 plus years
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:35.440]  and I've never covered news this science fiction. But you know it is the year 2020.
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:45.040]  We are in the future. We're here. Mike Adams natural news dot com engineer owns a major
[1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:51.680]  testing lab has businesses in China in Hong Kong Taiwan. He's been the cutting edge along with
[1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:56.640]  Dr. Francis Boyle the author of the US biological weapons treaty and world treaty.
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:05.840]  And it's all in mainline papers that five years ago Obama allowed this to be sold to China this
[1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:11.440]  very kind of virus. It was a big controversy lab made coronavirus triggers debate the scientists
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:18.880]  you go into the actual papers it's it's this major in the universities come out
[1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:23.760]  and scan and they go yeah you can see the marks where they cut in the HIV delivery system you
[1:07:23.760 --> 1:07:28.800]  can see the other viruses this thing doesn't have a pedigree it's not like a german shepherd or a
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:36.320]  chihuahua oh that's a chihuahua it's like a it's a chimera like the Greeks would say part snake part
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:43.600]  goat part lion I mean it's ridiculous it's like a a Porsche on the front of an f-150 pickup it's
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:49.760]  just you're like what the hell is that well now that's all confirmed and you've got the federal
[1:07:49.760 --> 1:07:55.120]  government admitting that it's super contagious and spreading you've got uh the fact that it is
[1:07:55.120 --> 1:08:00.000]  race specific coming out and and now they say Japan's the yep it'll be the new epicenter it's just
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:04.240]  racing through because they're from Chinese derivation but even more not the mean thing but
[1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:13.360]  more inbred more more uh less genetic code that's that's that's that's that's that's variant
[1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:17.200]  the perfect target for race specific bio weapons and that's in the news now that's
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:25.600]  racing through the Japanese uh so Mike let give us a synopsis on this right now because this is
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:31.120]  just unbelievable well the the term what you're describing the lack of genetic diversity is called
[1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:37.840]  genetic homogeneity now these uh delusional left-wing nutbags will think that I'm calling
[1:08:37.840 --> 1:08:42.800]  Chinese people homos when I say homogeneity because they they don't know what words mean and they
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:46.720]  don't understand anything about science and by the way let me just say I'm tired of this cult
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:54.000]  criminal Jack Dorsey leading this left-wing lunatic uh cult of of sensors and moderators who think
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.880]  they have a monopoly on the truth and now they're going to have a social score that's run by these
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:03.920]  left-wing lunatics they don't have a monopoly on facts they are living in a delusional world
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:08.240]  of mental illness okay that's what they are and Jack Dorsey should be arrested you're right it's
[1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:12.800]  called homogeneous which which caught which causes more disease because there's less genetic
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:19.760]  diversity right less genetic diversity exactly now look so America has a lot of genetic diversity
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:23.920]  because of our history so we have you know many different people from many different countries
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:29.360]  of origin different skin colors different uh DNA background and so on and we know that hybrid vigor
[1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:36.160]  in plants or in mammals is stronger yes yes but the Chinese culture is very homogeneous in terms
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:42.160]  of its genetic code and so if one person in China is susceptible to this then they all are
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:46.800]  and that's exactly where we stand right now and it turns out if you look at the ace two inhibitors
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:51.280]  chart of how many receptor sites are typically found that's right specific this is smoking
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:58.800]  gun right now we need a drum roll here explain this so the the people at least risk according to
[1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:07.120]  this chart are for example white people living in utah and then the next least risk is uh western
[1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:12.000]  european sort of white people from europe and then above that a little higher risk are people of
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:18.560]  african descent and a little bit higher risk is people of south asia such as uh india and the
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:24.160]  middle east and so on and then at the highest risk is asian people and the very highest is japanese
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:29.280]  so this tells you every time remember you talk about bill gates and the vaccine agenda and the
[1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:36.960]  depopulation agenda who did they always target they always targeted africans uh indians uh people
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:42.000]  from third world nations and so on and that's exactly what this let's be clear there's a giant
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.400]  history of secret testing against these particular grips i mean the the holy grail is a race specific
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:56.080]  bio weapon yes and look obama obama apologized for the nih running government funded medical
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:11:02.560]  experiments on prisoners in guatemala okay so the united states has run medical experiments
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:09.440]  on on on black people not just tiskegee but i'm talking about yeah guatemala prisoners of medical
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:16.240]  hillary apologized for rock soldiers before peru yeah exactly look the the history is well known
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.560]  i'm sorry to be so kind of excited i i'm i'm you should be that this is insane this is insane
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:28.800]  it's totally insane it's criminal it's anti-humanitarian and the united states has a history of doing
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:33.760]  this and it continued under obama i don't know that trump is fully aware of what's happening yet
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:39.600]  but he needs to lock oh i don't think he is but clearly gg ping bought it he's using it
[1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:43.760]  i had this weird feeling that was targeted japan like a week ago and i knew that they came out of
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:49.760]  the chinese they're even more genetically uh uh non-diverse and then now they say it's gonna wreck
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:56.640]  japan oh it's gonna wreck japan look uh there was a doctor iwata who came out in japan he was on
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:01.680]  the ship the diamond princess he walked off that ship filmed the video sounded the alarm said
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.400]  it's insane you've got people on that ship who don't know anything about infectious disease
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:10.480]  they're wearing gloves and dealing with patients and then with those gloves on the air is always
[1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:16.080]  circulating and yeah the air is recirculated but people were just walking across the containment
[1:12:16.080 --> 1:12:21.440]  zone versus the green zone versus the red zone and he said the whole ship was run by incompetent
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.560]  bureaucrats and it turns out people are dying on the ship and they just look oh my god it's insane
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:30.800]  and this is let's go back though to the genetic i mean they now know it's race specific they explain
[1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:37.840]  the code that's in the in the virus well yeah look the code is the s proteins the glycoprotein
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:43.680]  affects all of this what it what it means is that this was absolutely engineered and it's going to
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:48.880]  be very very hard to defeat because you see the world governments are attacking this as if it were
[1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:54.560]  sars which is a totally different beast sars isn't really infectious until you start to show symptoms
[1:12:54.560 --> 1:13:00.720]  this is a thing that's mutating this is a stealth virus it was designed for stealth spread which is
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:06.000]  why you're getting super spreaders in places like south korea one woman went to that church in south
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:11.440]  korea one woman has spread it to now over a hundred people and who knows how many of those hundred
[1:13:11.440 --> 1:13:17.360]  people are spreading it to tens wow so who really stands to gain from this mic i mean the globalist
[1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:22.880]  stand again the globalists have won a depopulation they wanted an economic reset they wanted a medical
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:29.840]  martial law force vaccination and total censorship overall speech online this coronavirus delivers
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:34.400]  every agenda the globalists have been demanding and pushing toward they're gonna they're gonna
[1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:39.680]  remember china has killed 400 million of their own girls they're the only country in the world
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:43.920]  that says they want to depopulate so they would play along with this as a reset to even hurt the
[1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:47.840]  world economy which they admit it's bringing down to then embarrass trump and nationalists i don't
[1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:51.520]  see trump ever pulling the trigger on this even though it looks like it's an obvious
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:56.560]  race specific bio weapon we sold it again major university sold in 2015 to the chinese government
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:01.280]  that's on record i don't i don't even know what trump what trump's celebrating right now he hasn't
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:07.440]  gone after big tech i mean the the the censorship is irreconcilable with basic human freedom we
[1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:14.320]  cannot make you right as i said this myself we call it censorship it's ai surveillance in real time
[1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:19.680]  with third party groups adl southern barbie law center in your computer in your private messages
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:24.720]  literally surveilling us it's completely illegal if the italian mafia did this we'd all hunt them
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:29.920]  down and kill them they're angels compared to this this is unbelievable so it's it's outright
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:34.960]  fascism by the left and it has real implications life and death implications when it comes to this
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:40.880]  pandemic when you've got again the independent media is weeks ahead of the mainstream media on this
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:45.120]  we have the facts we're doing the research we can read the studies the average mainstream media
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:49.600]  journalist has no clue about anything related to science they they still think carbon dioxide is
[1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:54.240]  a polluted for god's sake they don't understand they're not worried about genetic engineering
[1:14:54.240 --> 1:15:00.800]  human animal hybrids toxic waste dumping aerosol secret engineering nuclear leaks that the left
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:07.120]  says nuclear power is wonderful no they're insane they're they're totally insane and they say that
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:12.000]  that it's okay to medically modify children with puberty blocking chemicals now and if you

[1:18:08.240 --> 1:18:13.200]  pattern over and over again i've been on radio for 25 years i've had storeable food for a long time
[1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:18.080]  and i learned very quickly a lot of these companies they're fine during normal times during a crisis
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:22.160]  they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory they'll still take your orders that's
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:27.440]  why about 11 years ago i found my patriot supply now the biggest most trusted company out there and
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:31.200]  i became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand they actually give it
[1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:34.800]  delivered to you on time they do what they're gonna say they're gonna do because they want you as a
[1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:38.800]  customer over and over again and they're good people now they were saying seven to ten days
[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:42.240]  before shipping because they've got the food but they got a package at record level orders

[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:20.400]  taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and then every day i have
[1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:26.960]  stacks of news articles just like today uk k team find under house arrest for asking trans police
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:33.680]  officers gender and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:41.040]  ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:47.360]  that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason you get fined and
[1:19:47.360 --> 1:19:53.200]  you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part
[1:19:53.200 --> 1:20:02.560]  of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it you're listening to the alex
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:19.440]  jones show i was just given a new article during the last break it's on info wars.com by kit daniels
[1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:25.280]  feminist we must abolish the family to have a feminist future advice is promoting it on hbo
[1:20:25.280 --> 1:20:31.680]  before i read the article i knew what i would see surrogacy don't just abort your baby only have one
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:39.600]  with a surrogate don't have a man involved end the family everything we see is post-human
[1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:47.040]  everything we see is weaponized evil it's none of this world folks no scientists could look at this
[1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:54.960]  and analyze it and say it's it's not human the attack we're not sure exactly who they are what the
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:59.920]  group is the bible is pretty clear about it and we're seeing it manifest we've got to come together
[1:21:00.480 --> 1:21:04.480]  we've got to stop fighting over what color we are we've got to get down to brass tacks and defend
[1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:09.120]  our genetics and work this out my condoms i'm going to let you host the next eight minutes because
[1:21:09.120 --> 1:21:18.400]  i'll interrupt this is so huge confirm bio weapon confirm spreading high lethality um where's the
[1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:23.840]  left it's obviously very specific that's admitted i don't think the u.s released it we did sell it to
[1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:29.920]  china but again gg ping has said they have too many people this makes him a victim it's face saving
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:35.040]  you've got the floor for the next eight minutes take over yeah it's very clear that first of all
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:41.040]  china has infiltrated universities in the united states and they purchased at least one sample
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:45.440]  that's relevant to this from a university in the united states according to francis boil in the
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:50.240]  interview just the other day so universities take money from china and then they give up their
[1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:54.400]  intellectual property to china china has also infiltrated the state governorships and they've
[1:21:54.400 --> 1:22:00.720]  infiltrated congress how many i would interrupt i'm gonna leave the room so i won't but we said
[1:22:00.720 --> 1:22:05.360]  this 20 years ago 10 years ago it's all over the news harvard yale chai com run they're arresting
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:09.600]  the heads of the science departments it's up so trump is taking action on that front sorry go ahead
[1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:14.640]  yes he is yeah and look china's taken over hollywood how many movies now are funded by china where
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:20.640]  china gets control over the scripts i have no doubt china has influence over netflix and influence
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:27.280]  over amazon movie studios as well as everything that's going on in terms of of regulators and
[1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:33.360]  technologies such as 5g china has been pushing its its huawei 5g technology into the united states
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:38.080]  which is nothing but a surveillance grid that's going to feedback all this information to china
[1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:44.640]  it's a it's a nationwide surveillance spy grid for china all right so china has infiltrated
[1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:51.360]  everything in the united states and i'll say this on the record communist china must be defeated
[1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:57.520]  for humanity to have a future and yes you can quote me on that that's right it's public enemy
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:23:02.560]  it's got more uh to use it to japanese term godzilla's got to take that out it's got to fall
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:10.720]  it is so so whether this virus was an accident or a deliberate release if this takes down the
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:17.200]  communist chinese regime then that's at least one good outcome out of a catastrophe that will
[1:23:17.200 --> 1:23:21.680]  sadly cause a lot of suffering as well but look people are suffering under communism every day
[1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:28.320]  china is engaging in chemical warfare against the united states by shipping fentanyl how tens of
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:34.080]  thousands of deaths every year in america caused by china's chemical warfare against the united
[1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:40.720]  states so regardless of how this happened it is an important thing for the future of humanity
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:45.600]  to take down communist china we have no future if we don't but let me get to some breaking news
[1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:51.440]  out of asia this is only in the asian press remember what happens is i work very late because
[1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:56.400]  my offices in taiwan of course are up at that time and they're scanning the chinese media
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.640]  and then they're sending me highlights and breaking news translated back into english of course
[1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:07.680]  since i don't read chinese but uh here's here's a big one the biggest one from last night there are
[1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:15.520]  multiple patients now in china who have been cured of the corona virus sent home from the hospital
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:21.600]  and then suffered a new outbreak 10 days later of the exact same thing corona virus comes back
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:27.440]  so unlike in normal diseases where the viral load disappears once you cure it your body
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:32.800]  overcomes it the viral load goes to basically zero kind of a dormant state in the body that
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:38.560]  can happen with hepatitis c for example or hepatitis a very commonly or other other viral
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:44.720]  diseases you know like chickenpox for example it goes away but this one in some people comes back
[1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:51.360]  with a vengeance on its own without any reexposure to anyone else so so the thing is here alex and
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:57.920]  what your audience needs to understand and the cdc gets this even if you cure people and send them
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:04.880]  home they can get reinfected on their own 10 days later and then they can start spreading it again
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:10.880]  this has never been seen before in anything that has spread this widely never before and i believe
[1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:15.200]  it's a characteristic of the weaponization the genetic engineering of this system now when
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.000]  we talk about hospitals let's get to the cdc and what's happening in america and i know alex you
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:26.400]  can interrupt me at any time wherever necessary but i'll just go ahead with the cdc these hospitals
[1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:30.800]  the warning to the us hospitals is that the infections are coming now what we've learned
[1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:36.800]  over the last few days is that the death rate is relatively low if you get good health care
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:41.520]  if you get into the hospital and you've got fluids ivy fluids and you get some anti
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:46.640]  viral drugs and you could also use antiviral herbs as well basically the drugs are modeled
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:53.680]  after the herbs by the way but if you get antivirals your survival rate in a good setting like a
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:26:00.000]  first world hospital may be as high as 98 percent but what happens is when the hospital beds get
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.920]  occupied the hospitals are flooded and then people are sent home and they don't get good health care
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:10.960]  or you have these these shanty town hospitals built in china overnight that aren't really a
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:17.600]  hospital just quarantine death zones death camps then then the death rate goes to 15 17 maybe 18
[1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:24.240]  percent so if you talk about america you've got 980 000 hospital beds in the entire country
[1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:29.520]  about 75 percent of those beds are currently occupied which means you've got less than a
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:34.480]  quarter of a million hospital beds in the entire country so the first let's say quarter of a million
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.120]  people to get infected might be able to go to the hospital but the real number is way smaller
[1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:46.160]  because those hospital beds aren't biocontainment rooms so the number of biocontainment rooms i.e.
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:51.600]  isolation rooms in america is probably fewer than 10 000 i mean that that might even be
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:56.800]  a generous number it's probably only 5000 i don't know the number but it's small once you go beyond
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:03.680]  that then the hospitals get flooded the hospital staff start to get infected the doctors and nurses
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:07.920]  are infected people start to get sent home hey we're out of space we don't have any more beds
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:14.560]  that's when the death rate starts to go to 15 17 18 percent so if if you are going to get sick from
[1:27:14.560 --> 1:27:20.560]  this you know satirically stated it's good to get sick in the first wave in your country because you
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:25.520]  sure don't want to get sick after the hospitals get flooded and this is the concern in the united
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:32.720]  states the cdc in my view my best assessment the cdc is already aware of hundreds of cases of infections
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:37.440]  in the united states of america right now well mike there's no doubt about that you made incredible
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:43.040]  points but the biggest thing here is i'm gonna coin the term this is a zombie virus i'm reading
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:46.880]  the medical reports you're not just saying this you said it three weeks ago now it's confirmed
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:53.440]  it's coming back virus has never mutate and then come back your body defeats it or doesn't
[1:27:54.080 --> 1:28:00.000]  so it's the weaponization this thing has so many things built into it it has phases in the body the
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:06.560]  perfect weapon to weaken you and then mutate to its next level and then kill your ass i mean this is
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:12.960]  they know it's by a weapon this is epic remember that the virus that has a super high fatality
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:16.800]  rate doesn't spread very well because it kills the host quickly this one is designed to keep
[1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:22.720]  you alive and spreading and kill maybe 15 percent so that's why this is such a dangerous way so
[1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:28.400]  it incubates for a long time lets you shed it lets you spread it with no signs and then you think
[1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:33.680]  you've beaten it but then it is it mutating again is how it gets on later it's not mutating it's the
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:38.800]  same dna but it's coming back in your body if there's a second wave in infected patients after

[1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:06.240]  trump all day long but man i tell you he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:11.680]  shot over and everybody i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take the trump rallies over that
[1:32:11.680 --> 1:32:17.200]  said about two months ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:22.480]  hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:27.040]  amendment defend the first amendment info wars dot com and it looks like duct tape it's just a
[1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:31.120]  regular sticker you put it over your mouth you go to a trump rally and you instantly take over
[1:32:31.120 --> 1:32:35.040]  without even disrupting things you will say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well
[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:39.040]  we're being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and dr pacinic i'm let me
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:43.520]  just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant you've taken
[1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:49.360]  the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon
[1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:55.840]  you have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence
[1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:01.840]  silence
[1:33:01.840 --> 1:33:09.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:19.840]  music
[1:33:19.840 --> 1:33:31.840]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:37.440]  spiro scurus journalists investigators about to join us here in just a few minutes i really appreciate
[1:33:37.440 --> 1:33:44.640]  him coming on mike adams of natural news is here with us thank god for frances boil the
[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:49.120]  author of the u.s biological weapons conventions he went and found where they were five years ago
[1:33:49.120 --> 1:33:53.840]  debating in the news that the exact same kimi revirus have been made and sold to china we can
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:58.800]  debate this all day and i don't like to speculate either to you or not saying who's behind it
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:04.080]  the clearly communist china stood to gain its face saving let's them take over taiwan let's
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:08.720]  them cover up the fact they just lost the trade war mike adams gut level who do you really think
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.520]  behind this we are speculating here we're just asking questions of citizens because they'll say
[1:34:13.520 --> 1:34:19.120]  oh they said this no we're just saying who could be behind it who stands to gain from a kimono
[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:23.440]  as they would say in any federal court well i know this is not the answer you're looking for but
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:28.560]  scientists are behind this and this is science out of control and in fact it was on your show in
[1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:34.160]  2012 eight years ago that i warned about this in a piece called stop out of control you're right
[1:34:34.160 --> 1:34:39.760]  it's mad scientist it's mad science mad science yep and and you know they play god with the crops
[1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.680]  genetic engineering of the crops and they they splice in you know poison and they're playing
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:50.560]  games with the atmosphere yes exactly the scopex project funded by bill gates to pollute the atmosphere
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:57.040]  to block the sun look this is science out of control rather than science being used for humanity
[1:34:57.040 --> 1:35:04.080]  so i don't know which government insane person decided to release this or what they're thinking
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:09.840]  or what globalists paid them off we don't know those answers but we do know that science has gone mad
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:15.440]  and that science is now the greatest threat to humanity when applied to biological weapons
[1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:20.720]  and things that can kill us i mean this is science killing humans okay all in the in the name of
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:27.120]  science funded by taxpayers NIH funding almost 700 million dollars in funding public citizen
[1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:32.720]  just put out a report that talks about all the funding on coronavirus most of its NIH funding
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:38.640]  paid by taxpayers so when you send a check to the IRS you just funded the coronavirus that may kill
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:44.160]  you by the way because science has has gone out of control on this planet i'll have more updates
[1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:48.720]  for you next week alex i appreciate you having me on but we got to stop this madness all right

[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:47.680]  covering but it's probably just best for you to introduce your news to us here and and and some
[1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:51.760]  of the original reporting and research you've done on the coronavirus and and what you really
[1:37:51.760 --> 1:37:56.960]  think's going on because the headlines are incredible un troops featured in military
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:04.640]  world games in wuhan china weeks before coronavirus outbreak nearly 10k military personnel from 110
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:10.560]  nations in wuhan china weeks before coronavirus outbreaks some weird activity there beforehand
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:16.080]  so you can give us an idea of what you think's really going on thanks for joining us hi alex thank
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:20.640]  you for having me on and i'd like to also thank your incredible team and the viewers for getting
[1:38:20.640 --> 1:38:25.360]  this information out there and not just towing the the narrative we always got to look into
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:31.440]  other possibilities now as you know the official story which is extremely flimsy is that the
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:36.560]  coronavirus outbreak originated from a food market in wuhan china now as more and more experts
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:41.280]  come out like the author of the u.s. bio warfare act professor boil was smoking gun evidence
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:46.400]  that the coronavirus known as covet 19 has been weaponized we need to explore and investigate
[1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:51.600]  all possible sources of this outbreak now of course it's extremely important to note that the
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:57.040]  existence of the level four bio weapons lab located not far from the food market in wuhan china
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:02.000]  which is now ground zero for this outbreak would be an obvious place to start investigating
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.640]  of course even the south china university of technology produced a study saying that the
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.360]  coronavirus could well have leaked from this lab which does have a history of leaking in the past
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:17.440]  but the level four lab there in wuhan is not the only possible source of the outbreak as far as
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:22.320]  i'm concerned in regards to the research that i've done and others have done on this as well
[1:39:22.320 --> 1:39:27.280]  and i just weeks before the first reports of the virus a pandemic exercise called event 201
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:33.440]  simulating a global coronavirus outbreak was held in new york city you guys covered it amazing work
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:38.880]  now the un participated in this event so did the world health organization the world economic forum
[1:39:39.520 --> 1:39:44.880]  the american and chinese cdc the media major banks vaccine manufacturers and of course the bill
[1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.440]  and linda gates foundation all participating in this event about six weeks before the coronavirus
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:55.600]  outbreak simulating an actual coronavirus outbreak now just this fact alone jumps out at me and i'm
[1:39:55.600 --> 1:39:59.920]  sure many others out there that what are the chances that basically a un simulation of this
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:04.800]  pandemic coronavirus outbreak happens right before the actual outbreak now i'm sure your
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:09.040]  viewers are all aware of this but what many people are not aware of and what nobody's really talking
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:13.920]  about at this point which i cover in two reports for activist post calm is that on this exact same
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:21.200]  day on october 18 2019 the military world games were held uh in wuhan china and they they did their
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:25.840]  opening ceremonies uh there were it's basically like the olympics for the military they had nearly
[1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:31.680]  10 000 athletes from all over the world in fact from 110 different countries well that would either
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:37.520]  be the perfect cover to release it on them to spread it among military forces around the world
[1:40:37.520 --> 1:40:44.240]  or for a foreign military to come in and spread it wuhan of course absolutely and that's that's
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:49.360]  what my reports explore now i'm not saying i know that this is a fact for sure but this is
[1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:54.080]  as you stated what would be the perfect cover for it yeah obviously this should be looked into
[1:40:55.920 --> 1:41:02.880]  absolutely now in this event there was a large group of chinese military troops who had the
[1:41:02.880 --> 1:41:08.880]  blue helmets on who had the un helmets on and they dedicated about a five six minute segment
[1:41:08.880 --> 1:41:13.920]  of the opening ceremonies to this so you have essentially two un events taking place at once
[1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:19.520]  one in new york city simulating the coronavirus outbreak the one in wuhan where what is now ground
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:26.320]  zero so pretty pretty amazing events unfolding as this information comes out now this would have
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:31.920]  provided as you said the perfect cover and i spoke to a former cie operative and whistleblower
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:36.960]  verne lion about this possibility recently and he stated that you can never rule out agency
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:41.440]  involvement no matter which agency which country now we can go through process of illumination to
[1:41:41.440 --> 1:41:47.840]  see who would have access to a bioweapons program like this now he also stated that it would have
[1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:54.400]  been very easy for any country involved to slip in five to ten operatives along with their teams
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:00.560]  there was the us alone had sent over three three hundred athletes which doesn't include the support
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:06.960]  personnel that would be accompanying them now and if this isn't shocking enough as reported by
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:11.360]  jennifer zang blog who is a journalist and activist she's been doing an amazing job obtaining
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:17.760]  information from china translating it to english she reported that prior to the military world games
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:23.680]  they were holding in china a 30 day 30 day countdown to the military world games where they
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:31.360]  were conducting emergency type drills including the outbreak or infection of a novel coronavirus so
[1:42:31.360 --> 1:42:36.480]  lots of coincidences taking place here in regards to wuhan and others we can get into further
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.360]  that's to give journalists with the activist post is here with us
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:46.880]  we're going to be going over all of this when we come back and then i'm going to continue on with
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:52.160]  alan key should have told you he was come on former ambassador to the united nations he's coming up
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:55.760]  and then dr nick baggage who exposed this whole thing first
[1:42:57.040 --> 1:43:02.160]  almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food but i know for a fact from
[1:43:02.160 --> 1:43:07.040]  sources to tell them people oh we've got it get your order in two weeks for delivery we follow
[1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:11.680]  this pattern over and over again i've been on radio for 25 years i've had storeable food for a long
[1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:16.480]  time and i learned very quickly a lot of these companies they're fine during normal times during
[1:43:16.480 --> 1:43:20.960]  a crisis they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory they'll still take your orders
[1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:26.080]  that's why about 11 years ago i found my patriot supply now the biggest most trusted company out
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:29.840]  there and i became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand they actually
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:33.200]  give it delivered to you on time they do what they're going to say they're going to do because they
[1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:37.120]  want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people now they were saying seven
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:40.720]  to ten days before shipping because they've got the food but they got a package at record level
[1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:46.400]  orders now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus so get your
[1:43:46.400 --> 1:43:51.280]  orders at an infowarstore.com get the best deals get it delivered first they're in our system it goes

[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:09.520]  like nobody else i just i'm just pointing out what i see it's just not buying it
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:21.920]  going back to our guest obviously wuhan and all the weirdness going on in china using this gg
[1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:28.080]  ping is a way to crack down is very obvious but getting past the journalism hat gut level
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:32.240]  what do you think the wuhan virus is and what do you think's really going to happen with it
[1:48:34.080 --> 1:48:41.600]  well on a gut level i would say just based on history and and what we're looking at right now
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.800]  with all the evidence that's coming out it it appears that obviously we're not being told
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:52.160]  everything that's taking place everything points to this being weaponized at some some level at
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:58.880]  some point as you correctly pointed out yes china is using this to crack down and personally i am
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:03.280]  more concerned about what the governments around the world will do in response to this
[1:49:03.280 --> 1:49:08.800]  more than the virus itself at this point of course you know we do have some cases here in the us
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:12.880]  there are thousands of people who are i agree with that i think the vaccine they're going to push
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:17.600]  they go oh it's a two years oh it's 18 months oh it's a year away they're going to have that thing
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:23.760]  in three four months well if this is in fact a bio weapon that means that it has been reverse
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:29.040]  engineered and that they would likely have a vaccine already on on the books on the table
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:32.960]  of course they're not going to roll that out because then that would expose well yes this is a
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:37.840]  bio weapon we have been working on this and then the vaccine manufacturers would not get those big
[1:49:37.840 --> 1:49:43.680]  fat contracts with the governments and funny enough johnson and johnson who participated
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:50.320]  in event 201 did recently secure a large contract with the federal government to partner with them
[1:49:50.320 --> 1:49:57.520]  to develop a vaccine for this now we did see that china recently rolled out some new laws there
[1:49:58.400 --> 1:50:03.520]  it was they they try to make it sound like it's to make their vaccine programs safer
[1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:10.720]  and of course included into that is a mandatory vaccine program in china which did take a
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:16.240]  effect on december 1st which just so happens to be the same day that the first reports of this
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:24.720]  outbreak began now going further into you know who could be behind us who is involved let's
[1:50:24.720 --> 1:50:30.240]  saying that it is a bio weapon of course you have to look at what the events leading up to this
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:35.760]  event 201 and this military world games there in wuhan is very significant it would provide the
[1:50:35.760 --> 1:50:40.720]  perfect cover for anyone to get in there any intelligence operation to go in and conduct
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:46.160]  a mission you know we have to go through process of elimination of who would have access to these
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:54.160]  biological contagions and as professor boil pointed out recently here on your show the us it appears
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:59.440]  sold china the coronavirus so just through that process of elimination alone right there i mean
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:05.280]  you have to look at who who has the means and who benefits and going into who benefits well
[1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:10.800]  china has the number one economy in the world right now and now they're at a standstill it's
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:15.760]  grind to a halt so that opens up a vacuum they're at the top of the number one position and the us
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:22.800]  is poised to take this position at any way they can we see that the us is already importing a poultry
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:29.200]  they plan on importing because into china because china is also battling a bird flu virus and they've
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.080]  had to kill off large large portions of their chickens so you know we there's a lot of other
[1:51:34.080 --> 1:51:40.720]  things at play here we have to look at uh uh how way or how way the the 5g technology company
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:45.360]  has a headquarters there in wuhan and now they're you know everything's locked down there under
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:51.360]  to me it just looks like a huge excuse for an orgy of just people are playing dominoes they
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:57.280]  beat the table up what does that do it just seems like a big gg ping power exercise the virus is
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:02.960]  obviously real spreads fast is engineered scary as hell but then watching the state response is just
[1:52:03.520 --> 1:52:09.920]  like an orgy of power grabbing well absolutely it certainly is and we have to question the
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:14.160]  the actual numbers you know the numbers that china is putting out okay they have
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:20.880]  you know reported what a little over 2000 deaths at this point uh 2200 deaths there now they have
[1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:27.920]  locked down 760 million people in china that's roughly a little bit more than 10 of the entire
[1:52:27.920 --> 1:52:33.760]  world's population this is the biggest martial law drill in history absolutely and and that this is
[1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:38.720]  something that we need to take note of here in our in our countries around the world you know i
[1:52:38.720 --> 1:52:44.160]  people say they always think that it can't happen to them until it does but uh going moving on into
[1:52:44.160 --> 1:52:51.040]  other possible outcomes we see the chinese government has already removed 600 billion dollars in cash uh
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:56.640]  from circulation and it just so happens that they're ready to roll out their own digital
[1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:02.720]  cryptocurrency their own uh central bank digital currency to replace cash yeah this to me looks like
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:08.880]  a giant central government communist power exercise except the virus is weaponized it is
[1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:16.240]  manmade that's all confirmed that just adds to the craziness i'm sure you're aware that new scientists
[1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:23.360]  reported lab made coronavirus triggers debate five years ago and then we've got the papers all right
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:28.720]  here where they produced it in the u.s. it's the same virus and sold it to them this is just crazy
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:35.200]  it certainly is and again we have to you know recognize the players involved in this leading
[1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:41.040]  up to this all of the coincidences or synchronicities you know leading up to this and the un being
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:46.880]  involved uh at at the same time in both events event 201 they're in new york city and being
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:52.320]  involved in the world military games there in wuhan china now to me this is something that
[1:53:52.320 --> 1:53:57.840]  is extremely important because we know uh that the you know you guys have exposed a lot of it here
[1:53:57.840 --> 1:54:03.840]  the un programs for like agenda 21 and the 2030 agenda of global governance and we've seen the
[1:54:03.840 --> 1:54:10.080]  major central banks pushing this hard through climate change and digitizing currency leading
[1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:16.400]  up to 2020 now here we are 2020 less than three months into it and this is already you know one
[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:26.160]  of the most wild years in memory sparrow other other points other what's the next big story
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:32.240]  you're working on right now well i'm actually i'm getting ready to uh interview professor
[1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:38.560]  francis boyle here later on today and then i'm also going to be covering uh doing an interview with
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:44.400]  jennifer zing coming up here soon people can look for that she is of course the the citizen
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:50.320]  activists and journalists who is obtaining a lot of information from china directly it was her blog
[1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.800]  that posted the information about the 30 day countdown leading up to the military world games
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:01.920]  there in wuhan china and the drills the emergency drills that they were having before this took
[1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:08.160]  place which did include uh infections of a novel coronavirus so this that's right and then bill
[1:55:08.160 --> 1:55:13.600]  millen gates had the drill a month before that it's incredibly obvious this is scripted the
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:20.400]  ends we're not sure of but it's scripted the un praising ji ji ping and stuff that hasn't
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:25.600]  been done since hitler uh this whole thing stinks to high heaven trump trump praising it the whole

[1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:53.920]  if you understand why the globalist why the servants of satan hate info wars it's because
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:59:01.680]  we're awake we're alive we're passionate and we're not giving up that's why it's critical for those
[1:59:01.680 --> 1:59:07.360]  of us that are aware of the new world order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they
[1:59:07.360 --> 1:59:14.160]  persecute us and they lie about us that's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags
[1:59:14.160 --> 1:59:18.880]  the globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:24.880]  they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:32.320]  innocent it is up to us who are awake not the sheep and not the wolves but the sheepdogs to stand
[1:59:32.320 --> 1:59:39.360]  firm and resist these wicked tyrants they fear the fact that we are awake they fear the fact
[1:59:39.360 --> 1:59:46.160]  that we are alive they fear the fact that we love god and that's all we ever have to know
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:53.760]  is that god is in charge you're listening to the alex jones show

[2:06:39.120 --> 2:06:46.400]  of roger stone that nobody else has and i was talking to the lawyer involved just like a
[2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:50.400]  four-minute break as i was running a little promo video i'm like what do we do with this they're
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:56.160]  like well what do you think you do with it because that's the thing about being in charge it's the
[2:06:56.160 --> 2:07:02.160]  responsibility you have to make decisions let's just say this war that's going on against america
[2:07:02.160 --> 2:07:07.920]  and the intimidation the bullying is just so over the top and they throw so many punches that
[2:07:09.760 --> 2:07:13.920]  they hopefully just give up but we're not we're actually winning and coming through the fight
[2:07:13.920 --> 2:07:19.520]  like mahamad Ali in the 12th round and we're going to win in the end there's going to be a
[2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:27.360]  heavy price to pay but it's worth it um as soon as i'm in the show today i will go deal with this
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:33.600]  video and the footage i've seen of of the incredible persecution of roger i um you know he's been a
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:40.240]  co-host of this show in the war room and we're right in the middle of the site guys but i was sent
[2:07:40.240 --> 2:07:44.400]  by lawyers this video just like 20 minutes ago and they called me over that's why i aired a tape
[2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:47.760]  before alan keys was coming on i would have gone right to him i'd run over and watch it and i was
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:53.520]  like what what what the hell is this um just just giving an idea of the harassment trump has gone
[2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:58.560]  through or roger stone's gone through we've been through a lot but those guys because they're old
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:02.800]  friends it's it's just been insane and they're not victims they're not a little wimp saying oh i'm a
[2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:09.280]  victim you just need to know it's unbelievable behind the scenes the left has pulled out every
[2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:16.640]  stop there is no chivalry there is no decency there is nothing but total insanity so let's shift
[2:08:16.640 --> 2:08:21.040]  gears just just know that i'm going to respond to what i was saying i'm just going to process it
[2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:26.560]  and i'm not complaining because i'm a decisive person but when you're getting this much information
[2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:31.680]  at a certain point i i've got to process this stuff i i've got to be able to think about it a little
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:38.320]  bit but with great power comes great responsibility spiderman says just being great power and great
[2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:44.080]  responsibility we're joined by the former head us ambassador to the united nations allen keys who
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:47.920]  i've really been wanting to get on the show more often we're really glad to have him from his great
[2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:52.000]  tv studios and all of a sudden new york or maryland or tennessee he's got him all over the place
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:56.000]  he's the best-selling author american conservative political activist pundit
[2:08:56.720 --> 2:09:02.720]  with former ambassador doctoral graduate of harvard university his family are great patriots
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:07.840]  i am tv dot us loyal to liberty dot com i'm just going to stop right there and
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:12.720]  just because we've got a bunch of topics i want to cover with him the abandonment of natural law
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:17.600]  the neglect of constitutional authority but i want to just ask him as a historian and as a
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:23.040]  father and as a patriot who's lived a lot of years and seen a lot since the reggae administration
[2:09:23.040 --> 2:09:27.120]  what would you call sir this period in history that we're in right now
[2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:36.560]  well i i think we're we have come to the crisis of american self-government a crisis that was
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:44.320]  predicted really since the very beginning the founders were thinking about this kind of crisis
[2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:51.280]  when they were putting the constitution together we had one crisis that they were assuming would
[2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:58.320]  come during the course of the civil war i think this is now a crisis that looms over us it would
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:03.680]  have come earlier i think because there was a period during the course of the 20th century
[2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:10.000]  when the advances of communism and nazism and all these other forms of socialist totalitarian
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:18.080]  tyranny were marching through european societies and were putting pressure on all of the western
[2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:23.440]  countries including those like the united states and to a certain extent great britain that were
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:30.720]  the fruits of the enlightenment thinking that then led to the surge of self-government of
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:37.120]  by and for the people as lincoln put it but i think that because of the excesses of those regimes
[2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:44.960]  and hitlers unleashing and the japanese unleashing of global war we got the impression with the
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:50.560]  success of the united states that somehow or another we had overcome that crisis but that's
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:59.040]  what we believed evil was defeated but it wasn't it wasn't i think in point of fact it was paused
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:08.800]  in a different way because a lot of the underlying philosophy that had fed the rise amongst the elites
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:17.040]  in europe of various forms of totalitarian minded socialism and and what we now understand to be
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:23.760]  fascism nazism and so forth and so on the collective and repressive totalitarian form of government
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:31.600]  that essentially sees an elite taking charge in the name of some utopian vision of the future
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:38.000]  moving in one direction or another but in a way that represses all the ideas of god and doubt on
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.640]  alienable right you might as it always produced nightmares it never produces anything good
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:50.080]  it has never produced anything good in fact it has produced uh what i fear will be the end result
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:56.560]  of what is happening to us right now the first thing it produces is massive death because you
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:12:04.000]  have entered into a period where people adopt a very literal understanding of the ends justify the
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:10.720]  means uh and the ends often are ends that require that you essentially cleanse the population you
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:16.320]  know we talked about ethnic cleansing this is ideological cleansing and i think a lot of the
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:22.160]  things that are now being put in oh we're going through big tech is just they've announced social
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:27.520]  credit credit scores on twitter and if you're a quote racist that you don't get health care in the
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:35.600]  uk it's just it's absolutely dangerous it's like textbook see i think one of the things that we
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:41.920]  absolutely have to start to focus on particularly among grassroots americans because we're under
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:49.920]  a forefront assault on everywhere you look we're in a war coming at us but i think they have one
[2:12:49.920 --> 2:12:58.080]  main and serious objective and that main and serious objective is to undermine our confidence uh
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:02.720]  in the underlying premise of our way of life they want to demoralize us their main mission is
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:08.880]  demoralization the rights and they mean to get rid of it so so how do we stop i totally agree
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:14.400]  they want to demoralize us how do we stop that well the first thing you do if you want to avoid
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:22.160]  being demoralized uh is you focus you focus on what is the essential point uh because when you're
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:27.680]  faced with that kind of an assault part of the assault is just to distract you from the main
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:34.880]  point of the assault exactly decide what that main point is and i think that main point is to overthrow
[2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:40.000]  first of all our confidence in the truths that this country was founded on starting with the
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:46.080]  premise of god and doubt on alienable rights which then overthrows our confidence in our own
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:54.000]  capacity to govern so that we then start looking for some kind of human which they're quite prepared
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:00.080]  to offer in the form of these totalitarian minded elites who will come along we have the money we
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:05.360]  got the ideas we've got the utopia just sit back and we'll do it for you bloomers says he goes i'll
[2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:12.960]  run your life just give me power no that's what we're looking at but they're also i think mobilizing
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:19.600]  to put to box us in and i think that's part of what if you think through the wise and where
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:25.920]  for us let's assume for a moment that what's going on with the corona virus is part of this
[2:14:25.920 --> 2:14:31.840]  kind of thinking is one of the fronts on which we're being assaulted it's the front that's
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:38.400]  pressuring us not to look at our way of life but simply to fear for our lives
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:43.600]  and in fearing for our lives to look around for anything that will relieve that and give up our
[2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:49.440]  way of life regimentation of our whole way of life wow i tell you alan keys you got to get on
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:54.400]  the show more we come back then let's get into whatever topics you want to cover i know you
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:59.200]  sent me some notes the abandonment of natural law scientific and moral what is natural law let's

[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:04.880]  i tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over and everybody
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:10.560]  i i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take the trump rally's over that said about two months
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:15.680]  ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:20.960]  of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment defend
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:25.040]  the first amendment in full wars dot com and it looks like duct tape but it's just a regular
[2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:29.200]  sticker you put it over your mouth you go to a trump rally and you instantly take over without
[2:19:29.200 --> 2:19:33.040]  even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.360]  being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and dr bachinic i'm let me just ask you
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:42.640]  what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant you've taken the very element
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:48.560]  that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:53.680]  of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence silence
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:20:09.600]  silence you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:19.600]  you
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:27.920]  well we have ronald reagan's appointment ambassador to economic and social council of the united
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:33.920]  nations and he's been fighting the tyrants well before that ever since alan keys is here
[2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:38.160]  when i go to c pack next week hopefully he can guest host with us at least one day we're working on
[2:20:38.160 --> 2:20:42.560]  that right now but he's here with us i want to get into the topics he wants to cover but
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:49.920]  i said to ask him we're all honest here the pros and cons of trump the fake impeachment failed
[2:20:50.880 --> 2:20:57.600]  with him allowing big tech to surveil not just censor and to bring in chinese social credit scores
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:04.800]  i believe it's president trump's biggest failing as an american birthright he's just torn away from
[2:21:04.800 --> 2:21:10.320]  us and he lets big tech do this i just don't know what to say at this point i mean can you speak
[2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:15.280]  to what your views are on trump and his positives his failings because we're obviously not in a
[2:21:15.280 --> 2:21:20.640]  culture of just supporting the president i'm i'm i'm i mean he obviously doesn't understand the
[2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:26.160]  problems or for some reason he's not dealing with them what do you think well i think part of the
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:32.320]  problem is that we we don't have the habit of presenting these things in their right perspective
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:38.080]  what particularly shocked me about president trump was that when they threatened to censor
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:44.720]  his twitter account he didn't get the point of it which is not that he was being threatened as
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:51.600]  an individual but that the president of the united state was being told that he was not going to be
[2:21:51.600 --> 2:21:57.760]  allowed to communicate with the american people that's not an attack on it he never gets the power
[2:21:57.760 --> 2:22:02.400]  of the office he keeps thinking it's about him which isn't a bad thing i love trump but yet no it's
[2:22:02.400 --> 2:22:08.320]  the office yes i'm not talking about the office okay you explained to me the fact that this is a
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:14.480]  government of by and for the people that the president so the people elected him and they're
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:20.720]  silencing the people's representative if he can't communicate with the people that's step number one
[2:22:20.720 --> 2:22:26.400]  that's a direct attack on the body politic if they can't communicate with one another
[2:22:26.400 --> 2:22:32.800]  that's a direct attack on the body politic uh and and that was considered by the way
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:40.320]  by our founders to be so serious that if you had behavior characterized by that kind of an attack
[2:22:40.320 --> 2:22:45.920]  from officials in the government that was a high crime and misdemeanor we are now getting it from
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:52.160]  private corporations who have been offering public accommodations to lure people in and make
[2:22:52.160 --> 2:22:58.000]  billions of dollars for themselves and let people invest in them and promote their platforms position
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:04.960]  to attack the body politic in its most vital function which is to exercise the sovereign power
[2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:10.800]  of election that determines who's going to sit in what office but the only way you can do that
[2:23:10.800 --> 2:23:17.360]  properly is to be informed and they are now trying so what do we do with election suppression
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:22.800]  voter suppression what do you think the president should do well i think the president should start
[2:23:22.800 --> 2:23:27.600]  looking at the constitution and going after these companies because among other things
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:34.240]  they are violating the civil rights of american citizens and they are engaged in something that
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:42.240]  constitutes a direct attack on the body politic which by the way is a kind of less majesty in a
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:48.240]  society that is an attack on the sovereign because when the people are acting in their capacity as
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:54.080]  citizens to prepare for voting and to go to vote they need that information they need that free
[2:23:54.080 --> 2:24:00.640]  communication the founders identified it as vital that they should be able freely to communicate
[2:24:00.640 --> 2:24:05.600]  and have access to available information so the system is attacking we the people they're
[2:24:05.600 --> 2:24:11.840]  saying we're not worth it we're not good don't let us communicate the elites no best well it
[2:24:11.840 --> 2:24:17.920]  doesn't matter what they're saying because we live under a constitution in which no i understand
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:23.040]  what they're doing is illegal and wrong i'm saying the outrage of what big tech is saying why do you
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:30.000]  think trump has missed this most fundamental issue because he's not seeing it in terms of its attack
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:37.680]  we talk about these issues as if they are simply in issues of individual's right it is an individual
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:42.640]  right right because all our rights have to be exercised collectively we're being denied the
[2:24:42.640 --> 2:24:48.320]  right to communicate in the commerce of ideas what they're doing actually implies the overthrow
[2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:53.360]  of our government that's what it implies then i'll stop interrupting quantify it i know you're a
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:25:00.640]  smart guy quantify it then quantify it i think it's easily quantifiable if you start taking
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:07.280]  all up all viewpoints filtering them through a controlled process a process controlled by a very
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:13.520]  elite and full of people that means that the people are no longer getting full information
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:19.360]  to allow them to know both what the issues are and what the choices are in terms of those who are
[2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:25.360]  most capable of representing their feelings for what this country is about once you have done that
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:32.000]  to any degree you have already overthrown the process itself that the constitution attends
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:38.400]  to establish exactly so an iron curtain of control has come in was put in there in the first place
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:42.240]  so what do we do about the iron curtain of control what should the president do
[2:25:43.520 --> 2:25:48.640]  the president should start bringing suit first of all against these companies by suit i mean he
[2:25:48.640 --> 2:25:55.360]  should develop cases that prosecute them for violations of the law i would put it under the
[2:25:55.360 --> 2:26:02.640]  civil rights attribute first of all after all if it is wrong to discriminate against people
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:08.080]  viewpoint discrimination whatever in public facilities and to lunch counters based on
[2:26:08.080 --> 2:26:13.440]  race and so forth and so on you have to make an argument to make all that into civil rights
[2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:18.240]  you don't have to make an argument to make it into civil rights when it comes to the activity
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:22.720]  of people acting as citizens it's right there in the first amendment you're absolutely right and
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:27.760]  it really is a unification of everybody's rights that are being violated this is the big unifier
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:32.480]  of our ability to talk to each other they're trying to block it this is a rape of the people
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:38.400]  that's right but it's not being presented as that see they're presenting it as this individual
[2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:43.760]  that individual that they can cry to attack and characterizes crazy and we even got a white paper
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:48.880]  from a major university saying ban jones first it will make it about an individual then they
[2:26:48.880 --> 2:26:54.720]  won't organize as a group it actually says that george washington university see that that's why
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:27:01.680]  i believe that the key to it is to wake people up to the fact that this is an attack on the form
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:09.840]  of government which is a form of government meant to guarantee the ultimate say of the people as a
[2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:15.840]  whole they are tearing it down i saw an article that had been published by some professor from
[2:27:15.840 --> 2:27:21.520]  marquette university just today or yesterday in which they were saying about the democratic
[2:27:21.520 --> 2:27:28.080]  process now think of it the dem democrat primaries this woman is saying they should be decided by
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:36.560]  an elite group consisting of politicians sitting pop that means to say the bureau by turning over
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:43.360]  elections to the chief swamp leaders that doesn't make any sense but it shows a will to confine
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:48.640]  the government and decision making to take it out of the hands of the people so that as nancy
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:53.440]  pelosi said several years ago elections won't matter so much that's what they're at well
[2:27:54.480 --> 2:27:57.280]  alan keys i've interviewed a lot of people but you've got to be probably the smartest you're
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:03.520]  absolutely right in the way you quantify and boil it all down to what it is it's just naked tyranny
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:08.000]  and trump makes it about oh this individual got banned that one got banned or oh it's a company's
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  right no their company's in unison working together to suppress certain groups well that's
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:21.040]  fundamentally unamerican and must be defeated we got 30 seconds to break but you should come back
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:24.560]  with your will you host next week you've got to just do a message to president because he gets
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:29.840]  messages from the show and the president's a smart guy but he's so corporate he just thinks well
[2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:34.080]  companies do what they want he doesn't get their colluding they're leaking together they're they've
[2:28:34.080 --> 2:28:39.600]  got ai watching people it's just so illegal it's so evil alan keys is our guest former ambassador

[2:33:16.800 --> 2:33:24.160]  man former ambassador to the un for the us allen keys best selling author knows his stuff
[2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:31.200]  loyal to liberty.com imtv.us so i've been erupting a lot because he's absolutely on target i'm trying
[2:33:31.200 --> 2:33:38.240]  to interject my points because i know trumps wrong i know that if the mafia whether they be
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:43.840]  whatever mafia dixie mafia italian mafia mexican mafia chinese mafia whatever was the
[2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:47.120]  the scientologists that they were trying to suppress speech like this they they get in trouble
[2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:52.160]  but it's big tech in live time saying we're watching you we're going to control you
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:57.520]  the president must take action but let's get into the neglect of constitutional authority
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:02.480]  and the abandonment of natural law what is natural law and some of these stories you sent me with
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:07.680]  ambassador allen keys please continue well one of the things that i i've sent the stories over
[2:34:07.680 --> 2:34:12.720]  for was to illustrate a point that i think we've been talking about which is that we have a tendency
[2:34:12.720 --> 2:34:18.080]  as americans to look at things in individual terms and to forget that the attack that's
[2:34:18.080 --> 2:34:24.880]  taking place is an attack that's taking place on the very foundation of our form of government
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:32.160]  and our way of life so that each attack is intended as a final result to separate us
[2:34:32.160 --> 2:34:36.000]  from one of the assumptions that allow us to govern ourselves well that's the paradox we're
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.480]  individualist but we have to have a collective just because communists are collective they're
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:45.840]  a false collective we're a collective that's via our mission and our ethos we come together
[2:34:45.840 --> 2:34:52.000]  through free will only our collective can defeat their collective and and if we don't understand
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:59.600]  that then they will end up battering the foundations down while we're frittering away trying to
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:06.240]  answer each discrete attack as if that's all the danger we face and we won't see the big picture
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:10.320]  that the house is going to collapse because they've removed exactly how do we answer the
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:16.320]  main assault well one of those foundations is for instance the authority of parents over
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:21.520]  their children and we might say well that's an individual authority well not quite because
[2:35:22.160 --> 2:35:27.920]  we claim to have the capacity to be sovereign people that is to say to be individuals who
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:33.360]  will care for the common good of our country and can be entrusted with the most important
[2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:38.960]  kind of power in dealing with that common good well when do we prove ourselves to have the
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:45.360]  character to do that when we raise our kids so respecting parental authority and obligation
[2:35:45.360 --> 2:35:52.480]  and responsibility is part of what must be done to make sure that our sovereign capacity is developed
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:58.880]  and respected they are now using all this gender junk everything is about keeping us from ever
[2:35:58.880 --> 2:36:03.840]  stepping into that most basic authority well they're destroying it they're denying it they're
[2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:11.440]  taking it away completely wisconsin i read a story where they're actually practicing deception
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:16.960]  they're telling parents uh they're not telling parents that their children are going to school
[2:36:17.520 --> 2:36:23.760]  and being encouraged first and then aided and abetted in adopting a different gender identity
[2:36:23.760 --> 2:36:28.720]  that they never tell the parents about imagine that and and and they're it's unbelievable it's
[2:36:28.720 --> 2:36:34.880]  it's it's it's not just physical rape it's spiritual and psychological rape and then
[2:36:34.880 --> 2:36:42.240]  you've read you've probably talked a lot about these efforts uh to promote uh transgender story
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:48.160]  hours and all of this sort of stuff what's that really about what it's really about is turning
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:55.680]  the children over to these folks who are essentially grooming them to no longer accept the authority
[2:36:55.680 --> 2:37:03.120]  of their parents or the reasonable authority of science or anything else in society follow their
[2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:10.400]  whims and people who follow their whims can then be manipulated by those same whims uh and and
[2:37:10.400 --> 2:37:17.280]  therefore you are actually empowering the government to fashion little automaton it really is it
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:25.840]  truly is monstrous of these kinds of of uh uh satisfactions so so continuing along this line then
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  well you see i think that when you allow that to happen you're essentially grooming future generations
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:39.760]  not only to be the play things of people of power that i think is obviously true and it's part of
[2:37:39.760 --> 2:37:46.160]  the crisis the moral crisis that generates so much indignation about all of this but you're also
[2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:53.760]  grooming them to essentially rely on the government's formation of their own sense of who they are
[2:37:53.760 --> 2:38:00.160]  a sense that by the way is not supported by science not supported by objective fact and
[2:38:00.160 --> 2:38:06.880]  therefore they'll be entirely dependent on government fiat government laws government support
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:11.840]  to support the fantasy identity that they've created for themselves right only government can
[2:38:11.840 --> 2:38:21.040]  enforce the fantasy land say again only government in the state can enforce the fantasy land that's
[2:38:21.040 --> 2:38:26.320]  right and once you put them in that position they become entirely dependent on government for the
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:32.640]  fundamental sense of their own worth who came up dr keys with a diabolical plan like this i mean
[2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:39.200]  this is we know it's the tavastock institute but man this is so diabolical well it's it's
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:47.520]  diabolical but it's also kind of what's the word commonplace in history you identify the
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:53.200]  means whereby you can manipulate people the best example i think that we all appreciate is getting
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:39:00.560]  people addicted to drugs uh well you're getting people addicted to say sexual pleasures related
[2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:07.440]  to sexual fantasies uh that have nothing to do with the objective responsibilities obligations
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:12.880]  and character required to lead a life yeah so people give up their whole identity in their whole
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:17.520]  world to whatever perversion that perversion becomes all they care about well they don't care
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:23.840]  about the rest of the world so now other people can be history's actors well other people meaning
[2:39:23.840 --> 2:39:30.720]  a handful of folks who are have amassed enough power enough money enough control over government
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:37.440]  institutions to dictate the environment in which they operate and then as i say give or receive
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:44.240]  the opportunities they'll have to satisfy their fantasies uh and once you put them in that position
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:50.400]  they become utterly dependent on the supplier and since the supplier of this opportunity is
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:55.840]  government it has no natural basis uh they're they're going to become essentially slaves of the
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:03.280]  government it is like a weird fever dream hallucination what the left does they're so unhappy
[2:40:03.280 --> 2:40:10.880]  they just attack bedrock of civilization and god system it really is satanic well you know it
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:17.280]  reminds me a little bit though of a kind of weird reversal of what was the case with aristocratic
[2:40:17.280 --> 2:40:25.040]  rule aristocratic potensions uh were supported by outward appearances that required a certain
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:30.480]  kind of power to enforce them on others so you got people to call you your majesty and
[2:40:30.480 --> 2:40:36.320]  your worship and your this and that uh in ways that would then contribute to a false sense of
[2:40:36.320 --> 2:40:45.120]  intimidation uh that's a lot like getting people used to uh being penalized if they they misgender
[2:40:45.120 --> 2:40:51.040]  so-and-so right so if you don't say the right title we're going to throw you in jail we're
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.360]  going to you know it's incredible you probably hear my show yesterday but that's what i said i said
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:00.560]  it's the new royalty where there are resting people that misgender in england it's a royalty
[2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:05.600]  you didn't give the right title since when is saying someone's a man or a woman or it's ma'am
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:11.680]  it's ma'am it's literally the new royalty that's exactly right but then you have to ask yourself
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:20.480]  what sustains this royalty what power is it that keeps them in power uh and and it's obviously
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:28.480]  just the power of being able to enforce your will against others but if a small group of people can
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:34.880]  impose their will and force the titles today no no no that's it if it's if it's the transgenderism
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:39.440]  today and mother and father's bad it's anything tomorrow if they can get us to submit to something
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:46.320]  this ridiculous now we'll capitulate to anything tomorrow it will be calling those who have self
[2:41:46.320 --> 2:41:52.800]  identified as elites and who have sufficient power to impose their will you'll have to call them by
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:58.960]  whatever name or title they demand and let's go back remember the deputy head of google five years
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:05.280]  ago in a lawsuit made his employees call him a beautiful female dragon in a beautiful golden
[2:42:05.280 --> 2:42:10.480]  building you know that sounds dumb no that's a cult if i made my employees call me a beautiful
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:18.560]  female dragon i would be in a cult well imagine that that nonsense is enforced by government
[2:42:18.560 --> 2:42:24.960]  and courts with fines and jail sentences and you get an idea of where we're headed by the way i'm
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:27.680]  not just saying this talent is i've been begging for months for you to get on the show i don't
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:30.800]  know why it hasn't happened but we gotta get you on every anytime you want to come on the show

[2:42:55.920 --> 2:42:59.600]  real stuff man we're talking about the real deal here and i and i love trump all day long but man
[2:42:59.600 --> 2:43:03.760]  i tell you he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over him everybody
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:09.440]  i i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take the trump rallies over that said about two months
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:14.640]  ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.920]  of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the democrats save the second amendment defend the

[2:43:24.160 --> 2:43:28.240]  you put it over your mouth you go to a trump rally and you instantly take over without even
[2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:32.080]  disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you go well we're being
[2:43:32.080 --> 2:43:36.480]  censored you know trump won't do anything about it and dr bachanik let me just ask you what you

[2:44:06.880 --> 2:44:12.800]  the un has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those

[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:26.080]  services the giant cloward and piven program the un also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us

[2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:35.360]  all right former ambassador to the un allen keys is our guest he's on fire as usual here today
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:42.160]  we have the fourth hour coming up as well with nick baggots but i'll do a few segments and hit
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:46.320]  some other news i haven't gotten to he is going to be colossing at least one of the shows next week
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:51.840]  so allen keys you boil down who these people are and what they're doing you've got these
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:56.160]  articles growing secession movement you know the left can say these cities are above the law
[2:47:56.160 --> 2:48:00.960]  illegal aliens can drink and drive they cannot pay taxes well what happens with secession movements
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:06.720]  on the other side what do you see the pushback of americans against the system what do you see
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:13.120]  unfolding well one i think that particular movement is a rational response to the fact
[2:48:13.120 --> 2:48:18.160]  that democrats are trying to build an urban-based tyranny in the country precisely the thing by the
[2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:25.760]  way that the whole founding system was devised to avoid the whole electoral college or other
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:32.960]  sectional tyranny over the whole country and it neglects a couple of important factors aside
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:38.720]  from the fact that you're usurping the overall electoral process you're also acting as if
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:44.880]  numbers are the only thing that matters and of course that's not true because each section
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:50.160]  of our country contributes something that's vital to the rest of us so that you may have
[2:48:50.160 --> 2:48:55.440]  people who are fewer in number living for instance in rural areas but the food they produce is vital
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:01.360]  to everybody and they they they're holding the area they're paying taxes on it they say and
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:05.760]  they're trying to hold them hostage in the same way that in third world countries they often held
[2:49:05.760 --> 2:49:12.160]  farmers hostage and people who lived in rural areas hostage to the demands of the urban and
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:17.360]  and the military central government it happens over and over again that's right but you destroy
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:22.080]  the country because you're not paying attention to the vital contribution because you've created a
[2:49:22.080 --> 2:49:27.920]  new slave class the society why do you think bloomberg badmouth farmers and and badmouth
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:33.680]  mothers and bad and told his employees kill their babies he just has this sick attitude
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:38.880]  he openly says i should be able to tell you how to live i know best his arrogance is outrageous
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:46.640]  well i think the arrogance of uh it's it's outrageous but it's also a form if you analyze
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:52.960]  it through of insanity which puts the ambition for power above everything else so that you will
[2:49:52.960 --> 2:50:01.360]  sacrifice every good thing prosperity liberty happiness in order to achieve that power objective
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:07.200]  and i'm sorry he wants the technocracy he says to tell us how to live right and it's the most
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:13.040]  outrageous statement he just says it with a straight face well i think that's because they
[2:50:13.040 --> 2:50:17.120]  have no real standard of right and wrong when you don't have a standard of right and wrong when
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:22.000]  your only standard is power you can get away with telling lies and you don't feel that their lies
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:26.640]  because they serve your purpose you can get away with making promises and you don't have to keep
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.520]  them because they serve your purpose the only thing that matters is that you achieve your aim
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:38.160]  and what americans have to wake up to is to start asking we have produced one of the greatest
[2:50:38.160 --> 2:50:43.600]  outcomes i think the greatest for any country any nation in the history of the world we've done it
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:49.600]  on a unique basis of respecting the sovereignty of the people the attack that matters most is the
[2:50:49.600 --> 2:50:56.480]  attack on that sovereignty which depends on two things our own character and the authority of
[2:50:56.480 --> 2:51:02.320]  almighty god which was acknowledged at the beginning as a substitute for the notion that the only
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:08.960]  standard is the will of the strongest so let's talk about that other topic you want to get into
[2:51:08.960 --> 2:51:15.040]  what is natural law a lot of fake definitions out there some occultic ones but what's real natural
[2:51:15.040 --> 2:51:21.360]  law from a scholar's view and what is the abandonment of it well see i i guess i deal in american
[2:51:21.360 --> 2:51:29.760]  definitions natural law uh is is the the set of rules that first govern material nature on which our
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:36.800]  science entirely depends now is common sense science and so forth the other kind of natural law is the
[2:51:36.800 --> 2:51:44.720]  law that is represented in the way in which human beings are prompted to behave by their bodies and
[2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:51.440]  by their their understanding their ability to reason in order to preserve themselves preserve
[2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:56.560]  their families take care of their country and achieve a state of being that corresponds to their
[2:51:56.560 --> 2:52:02.080]  happiness and that's what was talked about in the declaration of independence and that natural
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:07.920]  inclination to want to do the things that will help to make you happy help to keep your family
[2:52:07.920 --> 2:52:15.680]  happy help to keep your community safe and your children safe uh that was the premise of our idea
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:22.400]  of equality because we all have that inclination and we stand responsible before god for doing the
[2:52:22.400 --> 2:52:27.760]  things that will help to achieve the results so why is there a war against natural law when it's
[2:52:27.760 --> 2:52:32.960]  common sense is what we know is right we want to do it that's right and and the government's
[2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:38.080]  supposed to respect that not interfere with it and we're certainly not supposed to turn over our
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:42.960]  responsibilities beginning with our responsibility for our family and our children we're not supposed
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:49.440]  to turn it over to anybody else because it's not just about getting things done it's about getting
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:56.480]  them done in a way that respects the provisions that god has made which provisions are the only
[2:52:56.480 --> 2:53:03.360]  ones on which we can base the claim of equality have you noticed that we're not equal in material
[2:53:03.360 --> 2:53:09.920]  provisions we're not equal in intelligence we're not equal in in physical strength in the rules
[2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:16.240]  of how it's supposed to run excuse me but we're equal in the rules of what works of what binds
[2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:25.360]  us together as as humans and you violate those rules but those rules are only uh how can i put
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:33.600]  it our only a source of equality when we acknowledge that we are equally responsible for obeying them
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:38.400]  and following i agree it's like we are all equal created by god to follow god's plan if we choose
[2:53:38.400 --> 2:53:45.600]  so that's right but that means and here's the fundamental error a lot of people make freedom
[2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:54.400]  is not the source of equality freedom is the condition that allows us to choose the path
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:59.200]  of equality oh i totally agree we're given free will by god to have the free will to make the
[2:53:59.200 --> 2:54:06.240]  right choice or not we're given free will by god so that we can make the choice exactly the freedom
[2:54:06.240 --> 2:54:11.280]  to make the choice is not the end game it's just the the climate to be able to have the free will
[2:54:11.280 --> 2:54:17.600]  to make the right choice you have to well that's where the idea of rights comes from i was rereading
[2:54:17.600 --> 2:54:23.120]  a book the other day the closing of the american mind by somebody i knew very well alan bloom
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:30.320]  who was one of my mentors uh in the early part of my college education uh and he contrasts the
[2:54:30.320 --> 2:54:35.280]  enlightenment thinking about rights and he says something that i don't believe is exactly accurate
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:41.120]  he says that the opposite of rights under the enlightenment was not wrongs but duties that's
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:48.400]  the exact opposite of what i think is the case in point of fact the root of all rights lies in our
[2:54:48.400 --> 2:54:55.680]  obligation to do that which accords with the will of god for our preservation and our happiness
[2:54:55.680 --> 2:55:01.040]  according to the law that should govern our nature not totally god's giving us a plan that's
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:06.640]  going to work beautifully but we have free will to choose it we have free will to choose it but
[2:55:06.640 --> 2:55:13.360]  we have to use that will to do what's right when we use it to do what's wrong it is not a right
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:21.680]  it is that then has to be resisted by those who are following the logic of an alien what's crazy
[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:27.280]  is if you actually do what god says you're fabulously successful so why would anyone not want to follow
[2:55:27.280 --> 2:55:33.600]  that well they wouldn't want to follow them because though they're fabulously successful some of them
[2:55:33.600 --> 2:55:39.120]  they want to be worshiped as god and you can't be worshiped as god exactly you can't be god when
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:44.640]  you admit there is a god above you exactly and i think that that's what's making everybody unhappy
[2:55:44.640 --> 2:55:49.520]  you know caesar and all of these people in ancient times they used to get temples in which they were
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:54.960]  worshiped because they were so wonderful i think a lot of our elites miss that and they want to take
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:59.200]  us back they call themselves progressive so alan i can tell you're a really smart guy i'm not kissing
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:03.600]  your ass is true you don't feel good being praised you like your ideas being accepted because you
[2:56:03.600 --> 2:56:09.280]  know it's the truth but i don't like being praised as a god but i see a leaders so-called leaders they
[2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:15.360]  love it they go to award ceremonies and they believe it in you if you it's like you're exactly
[2:56:15.360 --> 2:56:20.640]  why would you want a temple built to yourself it seems compared to god you feel pathetic doing that
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:29.280]  but see they think they're god well see they're encouraging ordinary folks to give room for
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:34.240]  the delusion that they can be god they can be men when they're women and women when they're men
[2:56:34.240 --> 2:56:38.240]  and anything you feel like doing and so forth and so on everybody think that's for me because i get
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:43.520]  to do whatever i want no don't fool yourself y'all they're saying you can do anything you want no
[2:56:43.520 --> 2:56:49.760]  and that's not true so that they can do anything they have the power to do knowing that right now
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:55.440]  they have the power to do pretty much anything they please do you which world do you want to live
[2:56:55.440 --> 2:57:00.080]  in because i think it's crazy to go into the world these days going with god's plan gives
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:05.120]  you defense mechanisms and systems that protect you if they convince you to it to abandon that
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:09.520]  you've been opened up for attack the hedge of protection has been dropped by people that know
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:14.800]  the natural law they're just getting you to abandon it so they can dominate you well i think
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:20.320]  that's true and we have to know that that hedge of protection is not theoretical it's actually
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:27.440]  the confidence that comes from believing that you are walking the path of right and that other
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:33.680]  people of right mind will stay with you that's what made the new model army successful when the

[3:00:37.840 --> 3:00:43.120]  they're serving the devil the devil's real alan keys former ambassador of the un has been with us
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:47.600]  he's going to be hosting one of the days next week at least we really appreciate him being one of
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:53.280]  us loyal liberty.com in the four or five minutes we have left here what else you want to put out
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:01:00.560]  today and and put out the president and others about where you see us in time and space well the
[3:01:00.560 --> 3:01:07.120]  first thing i want to say alex is i want to thank you because i think you have been encouraging
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:12.480]  people to think strategically and people think that that means all wars and so forth and it
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:19.040]  does in a way but it's closely allied to what they stigmatize as conspiracy thinking well what is
[3:01:19.040 --> 3:01:24.400]  conspiracy thinking it's the thinking that is done by people who think that others are out to get
[3:01:24.400 --> 3:01:30.000]  them what does a general always think like he always thinks that the enemy's out to get him
[3:01:30.640 --> 3:01:36.000]  what is strategy the way a general thinks so i think that people need to be encouraged to do
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:42.080]  what you do look ahead think strategically and realize that a hill can be a nice place to have
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:47.680]  a picnic or it can be a place where you put the cannon with which you're going to destroy
[3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:54.320]  the people and i think we're no longer thinking strategically as a people and we need to about
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:58.720]  every problem that's right we've been taught to just trust whatever we're being given oh don't
[3:01:58.720 --> 3:02:03.120]  say mother and father we're going to have some men dressed up like clowns come have your kids bounce
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:07.440]  on their knee and just don't think strategically don't think why they're doing that obviously
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:12.160]  they're pedophiles obviously they're grooming people they say they are i mean it's not even like
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:18.400]  strategic it's like just seeing what's in front of you and not behaving like dodo birds well i
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:24.640]  think that that's what strategy is about in a way and part of the advantage that i believe christianity
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:31.360]  gave to people over the centuries was that it posited an adversary who's out to get you every
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:38.000]  minute of the day if you don't pay attention first to the rules that govern your own safety loving
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:45.440]  be good be strong exactly uh so i think that that's a great gift that you give uh and it's
[3:02:45.440 --> 3:02:51.600]  what i have tried to do and and trying to serve this present time uh and i'm glad by the way
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:56.720]  that you put out such great products because i've been relying on your p.m. formula to help me get

[3:03:34.800 --> 3:03:41.120]  all have one purpose and the one purpose is to get people to think about the founding premises
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:46.960]  on which we stand as a free people and to apply those premises see how they're at work or being
[3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:53.920]  attacked in everything that's going on in our society now the crisis has come we will nobly

[3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:31.200]  let's see the devil he just sells nothing but destruction these people shine on believing

[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:13.840]  we had dr elmetease on for the last hour he just joined us and to listen to that guy
[3:06:13.840 --> 3:06:23.280]  because i've read no exaggeration over 500 history books and he knows what he's talking about it's
[3:06:23.280 --> 3:06:28.720]  so refreshing he talked to a leftist they get upset threatened by somebody that's informed
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:33.360]  iris by its informed and knows more than i do and i'm like wow this is really a good thing for
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:40.480]  humanity this is a big positive but not for them it's all about keeping people dumb and controlling
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:48.000]  them but i talked to alan keys so they're wanting to get back on for months and i'm like we've got a
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:57.840]  chance at victory we need more of this guy because he's he's preaching americana he's preaching what
[3:06:57.840 --> 3:07:03.200]  made the country why do you think we're so powerful we've got our problems but there was something we
[3:07:03.200 --> 3:07:10.800]  had that was big alan keys has you know phd's in that americana from harvard that was what he
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:18.240]  studied that's what he did and so look at that guy eloquent smart knows everything backwards and
[3:07:18.240 --> 3:07:25.760]  forwards compared to a leftist drooling hateful sing fu they can't even talk
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:34.240]  the globalists look at that and go look at our slaves look at what we've done to them oh they're
[3:07:34.240 --> 3:07:39.760]  so easy to control because they don't even think how they're connected to that
[3:07:42.320 --> 3:07:46.720]  it's a nightmare situation because evil is building
[3:07:49.680 --> 3:07:54.080]  and that's the paradox in fact cue that video up we have a big version of the
[3:07:54.080 --> 3:07:57.280]  bat boy attacking you want to play that in a minute
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:02.640]  because that's the paradox that vicar Hugo talked about
[3:08:04.640 --> 3:08:13.360]  the french statesman a philosopher adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters it's true
[3:08:16.560 --> 3:08:20.400]  if you wake up when you're five years old you go out and get
[3:08:20.400 --> 3:08:26.160]  it eggs from the chickens and milk the cows you go and drink the milk and you fry the eggs you
[3:08:26.160 --> 3:08:32.080]  learn like it's fun to go out and get the eggs it's fun to go milk the cows it's fun to turn the
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:42.240]  butter like the work is fun it's fun to roof the house it's fun to bring in the cows it's fun
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:46.240]  to slit the pigs throat you don't hate the pig you like the pig but you know you got to cut them
[3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:51.520]  up eat them you know it's like that's funny hang them up those are people they know how to do stuff
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:59.840]  versus the folks we see today who just are pissed off because they're cut off from their
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:03.680]  humanity they're cut off from the thousands of years of human development
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:09.840]  they're cut off from all their epigenetics i was flying last weekend over a bunch of horses
[3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:17.360]  and the pilot with the helicopter said yeah we don't know why the horses don't run we can fly
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:23.680]  10 feet over their heads and they just sit there but i said but well what happened
[3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:29.120]  if a dog got released in that field though the horses would run crazy because they have
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:37.120]  genetic memory of wolves and the pilot looked at me said yeah that's that's true a helicopter
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:47.200]  can fly right in right over horses like 10 feet above and they just don't see it because they don't
[3:09:47.200 --> 3:09:54.320]  have a genetic memory of a helicopter they've got one of men they've got one of dogs and wolves
[3:09:55.440 --> 3:10:02.080]  they totally spooked by dogs and it's the same thing when you have that genetic memory
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:09.120]  you have everything so what is our genetic memory you know if you tap into that thing
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:16.640]  it's not this planet it's a lot older and that's what they don't want us to tap into
[3:10:16.640 --> 3:10:24.880]  is the potential that we've had a long history this planet is clearly just one base of something
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:29.920]  that was done and we were put here like like they take guys that are in the army that want to be in
[3:10:29.920 --> 3:10:34.400]  those quote special forces and that just means you can like you know sign your name or tie your
[3:10:34.400 --> 3:10:39.360]  shoelaces and they send them out for a month to live in the woods of the jungle and take care of
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:47.840]  themselves because prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men so you get sent out to a planet
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:54.480]  you get dumped off here doesn't matter how advanced our species was before and you've got to relive
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:11:02.160]  it all and experience it to see who joins what because big mistakes were made before and and
[3:11:02.160 --> 3:11:08.560]  the thing about nostalgia is looking back and saying what could we do better we had these
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:14.080]  big wars and we went through all this evil and you know we blew up all these galaxies and everything
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:18.960]  else what can we do well let's seed planets again with the beginning of humanity but let's
[3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:23.600]  overwatch it and then try to figure out who's going to be good and who's going to be bad and
[3:11:23.600 --> 3:11:30.080]  then let's take those people they're they're souls they're they're operating system like no
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:34.080]  that's never made sense to me at computers i'm gonna go swallow these occultists and globals go
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:38.960]  away everything's uploaded it's all saved well that's just machines imagine god so the god says
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:43.040]  well i'm just going to put you down here to be tested and we're going to see what you do in this
[3:11:43.040 --> 3:11:49.040]  environment before you give him more power and then there's another operating system
[3:11:49.040 --> 3:11:54.880]  that wants you to join with that that's satanic that wants to destroy you and your family that
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:59.920]  wants to kill you that doesn't like you and it's not that god's the sadist you know the satanists
[3:11:59.920 --> 3:12:05.680]  always say oh you're god's the sadist why god allowed your baby to die or god allowed your
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:12.160]  wife's down a car wreck and yeah you're god's the sadist no god gave us free will which is again
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:17.600]  the only thing a sentient being in the universe could do was to create other sentient beings
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:24.160]  that have free will but then just like having children you give those keys to your 16 year old
[3:12:24.160 --> 3:12:30.000]  like you had driver's safety please drive safe but you feel guilty when you give those keys you're
[3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:35.600]  like uh this is the number one cause of death at your age but you're giving them the keys to death
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:42.640]  not because not because you want to kill them where's my keys not because you want to kill them
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:49.040]  but because they're free you want new people you want freedom you want them to have children and
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:54.800]  more sentient beings just like god made us as above so below so you're like here's the keys
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:13:00.320]  here's the keys to consciousness here's the keys to universe here's the keys to those cars please
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:05.120]  don't kill yourself i love you so much now please drive safe please listen to me i love you so much
[3:13:05.120 --> 3:13:13.840]  and then what do you do with that if they go wrong when they're given the keys to the universe
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:15.760]  is that god's fault or is that your fault
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:26.080]  so you could say god's ultimate sin is loneliness think about the loneliness like if you're god
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:31.280]  omnipresent you know the secrets of the universe and there's nobody there with you all you can do
[3:13:31.280 --> 3:13:38.640]  is create copies of yourself but not a copy of yourself that's you you've already learned
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:42.320]  all the problems you've already been through everything that would be a cult leader you
[3:13:42.320 --> 3:13:48.800]  could only create something that's new and independent that's based on biological diversity
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:53.040]  and based on what they face on a planet and based on the environment they're in and the
[3:13:53.040 --> 3:13:57.600]  decisions they make to then build towards something you're looking for something better than you
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:05.920]  think about god the the true god would try to say i want something better well i've already
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:11.120]  know everything show how do i do that again while i create something at the first level
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:20.960]  and if i create a robot that doesn't do anything but if i create something that has free will
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:30.400]  so well that's the keys to the universe isn't it the only way to go beyond god's consciousness
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:36.720]  is new consciousness the only way god can expand is to create new sentient beings
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:43.840]  that have free will but in that equation you're going to create beings that choose to destroy
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:51.280]  themselves most people that win the lottery end up in prison or dabble in a year and so
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:56.800]  if god's guilty of anything it's giving us consciousness and free will knowing that a
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:15:03.520]  large percentage of us will destroy ourselves instead of taking that stairway to heaven
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:09.200]  all right dr nick baggage is about to take over i'll have the sunday show four to six

[3:18:51.520 --> 3:18:57.440]  dot com i want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because i hadn't tried it
[3:18:57.440 --> 3:19:02.320]  except for maybe the last week and a half and um i told alex i said man this is the best toothpaste
[3:19:02.320 --> 3:19:05.760]  i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up
[3:19:05.760 --> 3:19:11.760]  there and tell people and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:16.800]  far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot of different
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:22.080]  toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this is the
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:27.760]  coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that i
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:33.440]  don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so good it feels like
[3:19:33.440 --> 3:19:38.880]  it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself brushing my teeth
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:44.880]  three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way it feels
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:20:00.880]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:30.000]  and welcome back and it's good to be back you know it's been uh
[3:20:30.000 --> 3:20:35.520]  i'm quite a while four weeks since i've been on with uh everyone here at uh info wars and i've
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:40.400]  been traveling a bit i've been working on some other projects and other news you know there's
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:45.280]  important issues alex got to cover time to get a little preemptive along the way but that's great
[3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:51.360]  because it's about the info war and that's what we're all here uh to talk about today and thinking
[3:20:51.360 --> 3:20:57.440]  about the last couple hours what a great friday what great guests and information uh flowing out
[3:20:57.440 --> 3:21:04.160]  to uh everyone um listening to the network and you know thinking about um some of the stuff
[3:21:04.160 --> 3:21:09.280]  i've seen the last few weeks i was actually in thailand with one of my business partners there
[3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:16.880]  and my uh fiance i'm traveling in thailand looking at a few things over there um in the healing
[3:21:16.880 --> 3:21:22.640]  technology areas some areas that i'm involved in and at the same time happened to be going through
[3:21:22.640 --> 3:21:30.000]  hong kong and uh you know during all this discussion about the virus and so kind of uh on the ground
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:38.480]  sort of observation uh from asia from me uh going into asia on the 25th of um january arriving
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:45.440]  thailand on the 27th and i went through hong kong on the way in um and then thailand on the 27th and
[3:21:45.440 --> 3:21:52.320]  then out on the 9th of february and um via hong kong again and here's my observation going into
[3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:58.720]  thailand there were impared cameras so we were being uh impared imaged on our way in and anyone
[3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:04.880]  whose temperature was up pulled aside and checked and then shuffled off there was any sign of temperature
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:12.720]  elevation um on that level when we left thailand on the 9th um and during the time in thailand the
[3:22:12.720 --> 3:22:18.800]  obvious the obvious thing was there weren't any chinese chinese new years in fuquette was the 30th
[3:22:18.800 --> 3:22:27.440]  of january and um it was like 10 of the normal population was there and chinese were noticeably
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:35.600]  absent throughout thailand throughout asia so they're not there um singapore not too far away uh
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:41.600]  where you have another lot of outbreak well that's where a lot of chinese money was being moved from
[3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:47.360]  hong kong during the protest in singapore which is another safe kind of place like switzerland of asia
[3:22:47.360 --> 3:22:52.960]  so there's a lot of money moving around gold is elevating a lot of gold moving around gold trades
[3:22:52.960 --> 3:22:59.280]  in asia like banking you know you take your jewelry and then cash in it's 22 uh and a half
[3:22:59.280 --> 3:23:03.520]  carat or better uh you know and just the whole thing is different the way they run their whole
[3:23:03.520 --> 3:23:09.760]  game plan is a lot different um so you see it differently now leaving thailand individually they
[3:23:09.760 --> 3:23:14.480]  checked our temperature and then when we entered hong kong at the airport before we got too far
[3:23:14.480 --> 3:23:19.040]  they checked our temperature again and then when we boarded our plane they interviewed us and checked
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:24.240]  our temperature again and then we flew nonstop from hong kong to seattle and got off the plane
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:28.640]  and nobody asked us anything nobody checked our temperature and we didn't see any infrared running
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:34.240]  or anything unique uh coming into the us so whatever they're telling the world at least on the 9th of
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:39.200]  february they weren't doing it in the us but if you were in the third third world where you don't
[3:23:39.200 --> 3:23:45.600]  need a committee meeting to make some happen uh they were uh doing the appropriate things at least
[3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:52.480]  in terms of screening but on a 14 hour trip you know from uh hong kong to seattle you'd think
[3:23:52.480 --> 3:23:58.080]  that on the way into the country you do something you know in the first world not just in the third
[3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:03.920]  world or hong kong which certainly is in third world but nonetheless you know that's the state of
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:12.640]  that um what did i see in the rest of my travels uh a lot of face masks to get to us um a lot of
[3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:18.400]  precautions you know in terms of how people were dealing with it um there now you know part of my
[3:24:18.400 --> 3:24:24.720]  other observations last few weeks you know while i was there is you know what was distinctly absent
[3:24:24.720 --> 3:24:32.400]  in thailand uh in pukeh which is a large city and then some of the smaller places that i visited
[3:24:32.400 --> 3:24:41.840]  was um what we perceive as a homelessness that type of poverty driven by despair or whatever
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:47.440]  in the us what we see there of course is low income people but you don't see beggars in the
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:53.840]  street and carrying signs and intent cabins along the road there you know there's things going on
[3:24:53.840 --> 3:25:00.560]  there's economies happening and people are a pretty self-sustaining self-supporting you know here
[3:25:00.560 --> 3:25:06.480]  in the u.s. and it's been a subject of a lot of shows kind of that was falling apart in the world
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:11.520]  and you know when i traveled this time one of the other things i was really paying attention to
[3:25:12.160 --> 3:25:20.080]  was um what alex was alluding to and what was alluded to by the earlier guest today is the
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:28.480]  crushing of liberty and that um it's not about trying to make donald trump lose an election
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:34.080]  and it's not about donald trump it's about all of us every one of us uh in terms of our liberty
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:41.120]  which is at stake when speech is impaired by uh those that control the flow of information in
[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:47.280]  the 20th century this is a human rights violation and i would suggest this is an action item for
[3:25:47.280 --> 3:25:53.920]  everyone in every state or municipality that has a human rights commission this is a violation of
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:26:00.000]  your fundamental first amendment rights to assemble in the town square of the 21st century is which
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.600]  where we are right now as you hear this broadcast from whatever electronic media you're hearing it
[3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:13.600]  from and those that have preempted this broadcast for whatever reasons of speech fundamentally is
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:19.360]  a violation of my constitutional rights as an individual and my human rights as an individual
[3:26:19.360 --> 3:26:25.360]  um as expressed at the foundation of our form of government and so i think that's a good approach
[3:26:25.360 --> 3:26:31.120]  you know the human rights approach certainly um is one worth uh defending and i would sue
[3:26:31.840 --> 3:26:38.160]  and i think that's correct for the violations of those human rights that's a good uh program
[3:26:38.160 --> 3:26:44.880]  and perhaps there's a pro bono lawyer out there that'll do that one uh and name us all as uh
[3:26:44.880 --> 3:26:51.520]  uh those that are being imposed in a class action because we are you know think about it we can't
[3:26:51.520 --> 3:26:57.120]  have a public debate we can't share information freely everyone is always free to walk away
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:04.400]  from a conversation or turn it off but we've lost the respect um of of that and and what it is is
[3:27:04.400 --> 3:27:09.280]  truly become something different and it's not about individuals it's not about egos that we need to
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:16.480]  defend so that our our particular voices are heard it's what all that represents for everyone
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:22.720]  that's listening and decides who's listening and who decides to come up out of the soup that is
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:29.520]  possible today in the way communications operates as long as it's open and free for that dialogue
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:37.360]  to happen and it's not free and uh it's not open in the way that it can uh enhance the public debate
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:45.840]  and preserve uh this republic and other forms of uh government that are driven by the people of the
[3:27:45.840 --> 3:27:54.640]  people and for the people the information war is really more about what we decide to do how we
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:28:02.560]  decide to attack the current problem and and are we going to do it from a foundation of human
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:07.840]  dignity and the basic attributes of what that constitution and bill of rights actually set
[3:28:07.840 --> 3:28:14.080]  forward because what was happening then was a tyranny um of elites just like we are talking
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:19.840]  about today different kind of royalty in the sense of how the elites function in the world today

[3:34:08.560 --> 3:34:14.640]  banned uh dot videos uh also has all of our stuff we've done here on info wars up
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:19.520]  you know when i think about uh what's going on in the world when i think about sort of how it's
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:26.240]  all been screwed down and i've commented a lot historically over um the issues of privacy and
[3:34:26.240 --> 3:34:31.840]  sort of predicted a lot of this in terms of what is happening now in the technocracy 25 years ago
[3:34:31.840 --> 3:34:37.440]  when i started this work um and published a lot of things back then you know and and the two most
[3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:43.440]  important things were the least read actually and it was earth rising uh and earth rising too which
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:48.720]  both are available with info wars and they were the prediction models for sort of where we're at
[3:34:48.720 --> 3:34:54.080]  and what some people are calling the matrix or the whatever you know they want to call it but i
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:59.840]  think alex had it right as we've wound down the last set his last segment today talking about the
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:06.640]  spiritual nature of this and where we are uh at this point in time in history uh people say in a
[3:35:06.640 --> 3:35:11.680]  lot of the predictions that have been predicted for thousands of years are now uh happening around
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:17.920]  this perhaps so um but the biggest part of all with all of that always comes into play when we
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:24.960]  start thinking about predictions of the future and often they're accompanied by a fear agenda think
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:30.160]  about for those who were around long enough and if you're around long enough usually 20 year intervals
[3:35:30.160 --> 3:35:37.040]  tell you the truth so uh i'm 61 now so i've been around three of those intervals and i think we've
[3:35:37.040 --> 3:35:41.440]  seen it you know in the 50s and 60s people were building bunkers for the nuclear attack that never
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:46.400]  happened you know in the 70s we were fearful because they took us out of the gold standard
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:52.640]  collapse inflation went nuts that we were going to be germany in the 30s and then you know uh the
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:59.920]  millennial madness at 2000 2012 12 12 12 you know that craziness and you know on and on and on so
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:05.280]  when is the hour of the moment no one's going to know but i would say this about all that is
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:11.680]  when fear comes into play the brain turns off and our ego nature comes into play that turns off
[3:36:11.680 --> 3:36:18.400]  consciousness the intuition the very gifts of the spirit and the attitudes that bring us somewhere
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.800]  that's worth going for those that are hearing what i'm saying um you know and i want to talk
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:31.360]  about that just a bit um because i think it gets into the root of what alex was saying what the
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:38.240]  last guest was saying uh dr keyson when i think about it um some of the stuff i've read and i want
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:46.720]  to you know i read a lot i read all the time you know my fiance will tell you and and i read both
[3:36:46.720 --> 3:36:52.080]  things that resonate with me that i believe in that i find uh close to my own heart and i also
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:57.440]  read the opposition news you know what i mean because i want to know what the what what is the
[3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:03.120]  rest of the world in terms of elites planning thinking orchestrating what's their propaganda
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:10.320]  feed what's their uh narrative creation model of their bs you know and you can see it on the main
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:18.320]  networks you know they even tell you up front uh it's the station is cbs and the programming
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:25.680]  is what they give you and it's true uh this one i read uh because it's worth reading and this is
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:30.960]  foreign affairs you know this is the insider for the council on foreign relations it's her
[3:37:30.960 --> 3:37:38.880]  journal it's a big book every time it comes out but it's funny uh because you know you know on a
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:44.400]  on a magazine when it comes out you always want to know who's the biggest sponsor you know of the
[3:37:44.400 --> 3:37:51.200]  magazine it's always the value buys the inside and back covers and so on you know and so you
[3:37:51.200 --> 3:37:58.080]  start looking at it all and you go wow this is kind of interesting the back cover ad is the central
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:04.080]  intelligence agency in the current issue so i guess they're the big sponsors for foreign affairs
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:09.840]  good to know anyway it's worth reading if you want to know but those that have the most to hide have
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:15.520]  to say foreign affairs get it at your local library it's expensive you don't want to subscribe i
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:20.480]  subscribe to like keep around to reference but one of the articles in here which i found really
[3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:25.760]  alarming and interesting at the same time here there's a current issue right up there on the screen
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:31.200]  you know there's why it's important um right now okay when you think about foreign affairs
[3:38:31.200 --> 3:38:36.240]  and and what they write about is to set the stage and one of them that's really important
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:45.280]  in this particular article uh and it and it's dealing with the epidemic of despair and it's uh
[3:38:46.160 --> 3:38:50.560]  the as i look at the article and i think about you know what they're saying is the average age
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:59.120]  of americans is decreasing from despair that manifests in three things people are dying from
[3:38:59.120 --> 3:39:05.120]  opiate overdoses in fentanyl which we all know is being shipped in from afghanistan in the form of
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:12.880]  heroin mexico in the form of heroin and fentanyl from china which is sort of the underway and you
[3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:17.040]  know it's again information wars it's a way to destroy a culture you know from the inside out
[3:39:17.040 --> 3:39:23.280]  uh the other is um cirrhosis of the liver killing yeah there it is there's the article
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:30.320]  killing people uh in uh on a wholesale basis young people we're talking about and then suicide
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:38.800]  and suicide uh from uh people um who are misidentifying themselves and then becoming confused
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:45.440]  you know you know uh and are in our schools uh that what alex was just talking about you know
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:52.000]  not to mention people coming back to post-traumatic stress syndrome war uh and are underserved uh
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:57.440]  when they get back and wars of perhaps we shouldn't even be you know when you really get down to it
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:03.280]  what are we doing there and what are whose interests are being served there you know who the biggest
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:09.520]  lobbies are the military industrial complex because they get the most money and we've been the national
[3:40:09.520 --> 3:40:16.080]  defense for every nation except our own you know and have dished it out and into the point of being
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:23.760]  in debt up to our eyeballs as a nation and then we've allowed uh the american form of oligarchy
[3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:30.960]  that control the media and and the public and private first to such a large extent from the
[3:40:30.960 --> 3:40:36.880]  pharmaceutical industry to the insurance industry to the finance and banking industry and the biggest
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:45.360]  of all the military industrial complex all sucking off of the laborer of people who work in america
[3:40:45.360 --> 3:40:53.120]  you and me and you know something about this in the 1890s the u.s supreme court said it was
[3:40:53.120 --> 3:41:04.400]  unconstitutional even tax our labor it was considered involuntary servitude slavery ladies
[3:41:04.400 --> 3:41:12.880]  and gentlemen not in a theoretical model but by the united states supreme court and their ruling
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:22.080]  and that ruling change in 1913 with the invention of the federal reserve which has never been audited
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:34.240]  completely in a hundred and seven years and it's controlling our banking and commerce on a level
[3:41:34.240 --> 3:41:43.040]  that needs scrutiny in terms of what it's doing and how it operates when you think about what's
[3:41:43.040 --> 3:41:52.240]  happening and now to control speech well the american oligarchs offshore their wealth avoid
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:59.600]  and evade us tax is something you cannot do as a u.s citizen you can't even give up your citizenship
[3:41:59.600 --> 3:42:06.720]  for economic tax reasons as a reason and if you want to you couldn't anyway without the state
[3:42:06.720 --> 3:42:13.120]  department's permission till you have that and when you leave they take 20% of your wealth on your
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:18.720]  way out the door what they say it's work but they don't do that to american corporations that leave
[3:42:18.720 --> 3:42:25.680]  america like haliburton to go hide their records by setting up their corporate offices in places
[3:42:25.680 --> 3:42:30.960]  like dubai where we don't we can't reach in with subpoenas to find out the billions and billions
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:39.680]  and billions of dollars they stole and lousy contracts and others have done the same hiding
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:46.080]  it's time for info wars get our speech back and president trump you've got to get involved executive
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:51.040]  order time for these guys shutting down our speech time to act executive orders still work
[3:42:53.040 --> 3:43:00.640]  across the western world from high school to college sports to even the olympics men biological
[3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:08.480]  men are winning almost all of the sporting events this is men invading women's spaces and bullying
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:14.800]  them and taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism and openness and that every day
[3:43:14.800 --> 3:43:21.200]  i have stacks of news articles just like today uk team find under house arrest for asking trans
[3:43:21.200 --> 3:43:28.320]  police officers gender and it hurt their feelings uk mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:35.680]  ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:40.800]  that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:47.120]  you get fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are bullies and it's sick and it's
[3:43:47.120 --> 3:43:53.040]  evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover resist it speak out against it there
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:44:00.880]  can no longer be any doubt this coronavirus is serious on multiple levels it's very communicable
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:06.640]  it spreads very very fast it is killing a lot of people and the chinese communist government
[3:44:06.640 --> 3:44:12.000]  has covered up just how bad it is and the white house is now openly challenging them show our

[3:46:52.800 --> 3:47:08.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:08.720 --> 3:47:34.160]  all right i i i want to jump into another topic and it's a topic of personal privacy and liberty and
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:40.560]  the digital gulag that we're living in that we're not seeing and i want to take a whole
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:46.720]  nether dimension of where we are today and i and i read some things that were really worthwhile
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:53.360]  and well we're talking about it mit technology review the current issue january february and bring
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:59.680]  that cover up when you guys find it and the other one is a book called targeted by britney
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:08.480]  advisor and targeted this book was brought to my attention because i was curious about all the
[3:48:08.480 --> 3:48:17.760]  stuff going on with cambridge analytica which was the big company involved in a lot of things
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:24.320]  that i'm going to talk about in this segment and technology review which gets into the cover is
[3:48:24.320 --> 3:48:31.120]  allow me to introduce myself in the picture of a kid with a bunch of devices and it's how the next
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:36.960]  generation is using technology to mass reveal and form identity and i want to talk about that and
[3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:43.280]  how that works because this is foundational to what we were hearing in the last segment and targeted
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:49.200]  is about cambridge analytica and the use of big data and how you can manipulate entire
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:56.640]  governments populations to do just about anything these are really important publications now first
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:05.040]  i want to talk about targeted the book targeted britney ties are is a liberal democrat who got
[3:49:05.040 --> 3:49:11.440]  involved in a very conservative group of people that were trying to influence political outcomes
[3:49:11.440 --> 3:49:18.400]  were very successful at it by utilizing big data that they got from primarily from facebook and
[3:49:18.400 --> 3:49:25.280]  maybe google and anyone else that has big data and big data where i'll say basically got every
[3:49:25.280 --> 3:49:33.680]  bit of data every place they could on every american they could which is everybody basically
[3:49:33.680 --> 3:49:40.640]  and cambridge analytica the woman that was involved with them was like a sales rep selling
[3:49:40.640 --> 3:49:45.680]  projects and it was pretty close to organization so she identifies a number of governments whose
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:51.840]  elections were won or lost based on how data was used collected manipulate this isn't about
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:56.400]  persuasion anymore ladies and gentlemen this is about direct programming and manipulation
[3:49:56.400 --> 3:50:02.560]  of populations it was later revealed that over 68 countries elections were tampered with
[3:50:03.200 --> 3:50:09.200]  by cambridge analytica now forget about cambridge analytica for a moment forget about that it's
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:17.120]  just another ego driven organization by people that wanted power and were greedy and don't
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:22.640]  recognize human values and don't recognize human spirit or anything about what we are for them
[3:50:22.640 --> 3:50:29.280]  we're meat on the table we're either consumers taxpayers or we're in the way we don't represent
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:36.000]  anything to these people and this is why we need to reclaim our republics our democratic republics
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  our democracies our theocracies our dictators whatever it is we're living under wherever
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:47.280]  you're hearing this broadcast we need to claim our government's back and have them reflect us and if
[3:50:47.280 --> 3:50:53.760]  it reflects us in a democratic public if it reflects us in a theocracy by all means have one
[3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:57.840]  wherever you are in the world and we'll try and stay out of your business as long as you stay in
[3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:04.160]  your boundaries you know that's kind of how i see the world and when i think about this intrusion
[3:51:04.160 --> 3:51:12.160]  and what this means and what we said it would mean 25 years ago is here right now and it's
[3:51:12.160 --> 3:51:18.640]  the loss of the essence of our liberty now why overlay it with this uh technology reviews publication
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:23.600]  this month because they talk about a number of things with ai and and and unfortunately technology
[3:51:23.600 --> 3:51:30.080]  review in my view this issue could have been a lot better should have been a lot better but it's
[3:51:30.080 --> 3:51:34.960]  okay is what they talked about that's important is they talk about the chinese model which we
[3:51:34.960 --> 3:51:40.160]  know about on this broadcast you know about facial recognition biometrics you know what happened in
[3:51:40.160 --> 3:51:45.840]  india with biometrics in the entire country over a billion people in china it's automatic
[3:51:45.840 --> 3:51:52.880]  and how they use social scoring and how you track all currencies when you have things like bitcoin
[3:51:52.880 --> 3:51:59.280]  made into national currency if china creates a digital currency this currency is a great way
[3:51:59.280 --> 3:52:09.680]  to pass diseases right we got to get rid of that look this is two seconds to midnight pay attention
[3:52:10.400 --> 3:52:16.880]  the opportunity to use ai in education this is the big one right because they're using it for
[3:52:16.880 --> 3:52:24.320]  tutors but here's the thing you started tutor with ai tutoring a kid chewing a questions answers
[3:52:24.320 --> 3:52:28.240]  with another human being involved until they learn to read and they eventually learn to read
[3:52:28.240 --> 3:52:34.960]  the computer reads them listen all the things within their within their matrix of questions
[3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:39.840]  there's the way they ask questions the way they do math tests the way they do story problems all
[3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:45.680]  of it becomes indoctrination i dropped my fiance son off to school and was joking with them
[3:52:46.720 --> 3:52:52.400]  yesterday morning and i said yep get ready i'm dropping it off to the propaganda palace for
[3:52:52.400 --> 3:52:56.160]  your indoctrination because he actually is a thinking kid you know he thought that was pretty
[3:52:56.160 --> 3:53:01.920]  funny today but that's the truth of the matter you got to get engaged in your kids and all in a
[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:10.000]  conversation you know talk about breaking down the nonsense because this biological recognition
[3:53:10.000 --> 3:53:15.120]  system and then later the way you'll engage banking globally will be digitally and handing
[3:53:15.120 --> 3:53:20.000]  that again to an institution that's never been audited as i mentioned in the last segment when
[3:53:20.000 --> 3:53:29.280]  we became slaves banks now let me say that again okay in the 1890s it was unconstitutional
[3:53:29.280 --> 3:53:36.080]  by your supreme court tax your labor because that made you a slave that's what the court said
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:42.480]  we're a slave they couldn't do that had to change all that we had we had the appropriate
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:46.480]  amendment that allowed for income tax for my federal reserve then we never audited anybody
[3:53:46.480 --> 3:53:50.720]  we just gave it all to the bankers and a mineral and oil and gas interest it got things called
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:55.280]  depletion allowances which give them a big discount on what they would otherwise pay in
[3:53:55.280 --> 3:53:59.600]  tax they gave lower corporate rates and if they did something overseas we didn't mess with them
[3:53:59.600 --> 3:54:03.280]  but you as an individual wherever you go in the world to make your money no matter whether you
[3:54:03.280 --> 3:54:08.720]  ever set foot on this country again is taxed by the US government and that's the rules because
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:14.000]  we're one of the only place countries in the world that taxes your worldwide income as an
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:20.320]  individual but not in the same way the corporation way they can shell game to corporations or
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:25.040]  intellectual property other aspects of their businesses and play the game which doesn't
[3:54:25.040 --> 3:54:29.600]  apply if you own more than five percent of your company so they wipe out individuals or families
[3:54:29.600 --> 3:54:36.320]  from playing the same game reserve that only for the rich the elites right that's how it works
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:42.560]  okay so what's happening in the world is the stripping of our ability to communicate on these
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:47.600]  and other important issues where you know and and really look at all this and so the matrix is being
[3:54:47.600 --> 3:54:56.160]  created it's the false matrix that alex was referring to it's the anti christ if you will
[3:54:57.440 --> 3:55:02.720]  it's the fear driven thing that makes people fearful and act badly and i want to remind
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:07.760]  people of a couple things because of the nature of where we are in the info wars and i looked it up
[3:55:07.760 --> 3:55:14.960]  today so it's important and i recommend everyone look it up and it's the beatitudes and they're
[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:20.720]  really simple you know and and rather than restate them all i'll just sum it up with they all they
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:28.640]  all start with the same thing blessed are blessed are the poor in spirit those who mourn the meat
[3:55:29.440 --> 3:55:35.280]  those who hunger and thirst for righteousness the merciful the pure of heart the peacemakers
[3:55:35.280 --> 3:55:41.760]  you know when you think about that you know these are the roles that we need to adopt
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:51.280]  and how we use our speech as the sword that expresses who we are and what we are into the world
[3:55:52.000 --> 3:55:55.600]  you know we should do it in that spirit because that's what makes things happen
[3:55:55.600 --> 3:56:02.240]  and the alternative to programming and ai and all the garbage that it has to offer because think
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:07.520]  about it from five years old till high school you don't think ai will know everything about
[3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:13.280]  your kids if this is the way tutors operate every detail be able to predict what your kids
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:18.720]  will do better than they can within the first few years without engagement being able to direct
[3:56:18.720 --> 3:56:23.600]  them and know who's going to act out and predict models with such uncanniness that the ability
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:31.040]  to manipulate and control is the only thing that comes out of that it is the only product
[3:56:31.040 --> 3:56:38.240]  that comes out of that is a digital gulag that's what comes out of that that is the net effect
[3:56:38.240 --> 3:56:44.720]  the net result we said it 25 years ago i'm saying it again today open your eyes but more
[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:50.080]  importantly open your heart to what the truth of the matter is and there are some things there are
[3:56:50.080 --> 3:56:56.160]  gifts of the spirit that is a counterbalance to this look them up because we're going to be out
[3:56:56.160 --> 3:57:03.360]  of time and i'm going to get to it today gifts of the spirit look it up this is the sword that
[3:57:03.360 --> 3:57:12.320]  begins of the game again using wisdom knowledge healing even miracles all of those things discerning
[3:57:12.320 --> 3:57:18.160]  the spirits what does that mean it's sorting out the truth from the lies it's the info what we're
[3:57:18.160 --> 3:57:25.200]  in right now donald trump use your executive power to restore free speech before this election
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:31.440]  happens or you'll lose this election because it's a war about information it's a propaganda war
[3:57:31.440 --> 3:57:38.800]  and you're being screwed over but more importantly speech is being screwed over which means every
[3:57:38.800 --> 3:57:45.280]  single breathing american our speech is at stake with the daily wear and tear of the environment
