[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Thursday, December 17 transmission.
[00:11.280 --> 00:16.120]  We have some of the biggest news, again, ever unfolding, but I first want to go to a very
[00:16.120 --> 00:22.520]  important report and then we will be back on the other side with the former CIA director
[00:22.520 --> 00:25.560]  calling for my arrest and why that's so important and how that ties into a bigger picture.
[00:25.560 --> 00:26.560]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:26.560 --> 00:27.560]  This is the M4 War.
[00:27.560 --> 00:28.560]  Stay with us.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, deep state darling, Michael Hayden has called for my arrest.
[00:33.720 --> 00:44.480]  Well, guess what, my friend, I called for your arrest for your crimes against humanity.
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.840]  My understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies that you must
[00:49.840 --> 00:57.280]  have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not violate an American's right
[00:57.280 --> 01:01.280]  against unlawful searches and seizures.
[01:01.280 --> 01:07.680]  The Fourth Amendment actually protects all of us against unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.240]  But the measure is probable cause, I believe.
[01:11.240 --> 01:14.000]  The amendment says unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.160]  But does it not say probable?
[01:16.160 --> 01:20.520]  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against
[01:20.520 --> 01:27.400]  unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated, no warrant shall issue, but upon
[01:27.400 --> 01:33.320]  probable cause, but upon probable cause, probable cause, probable cause.
[01:33.320 --> 01:38.200]  Just to be very clear, okay, and believe me, if there's any amendment to the Constitution
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.080]  that employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with, it's the Fourth.
[01:42.080 --> 01:45.360]  Oh my gosh, I'm so scared.
[01:45.360 --> 01:55.400]  Former head of the NSA, NCIA, Deep State Darling, little sugarplum dough boy himself, kind of
[01:55.400 --> 02:02.760]  the mini-me of Dr. Ebeltypes, General Michael Hayden has come out in a grieve, one of these
[02:02.760 --> 02:08.360]  leftist authoritarians on Twitter, that I need to be arrested right now for death-threading
[02:08.360 --> 02:10.480]  Joe Biden.
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.240]  But notice in the tweets, they don't show what I actually said.
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.680]  I said Joe Biden represents a politically dead system.
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.440]  Joe Biden's the perfect, emblematic spokesperson of the reanimated corpses.
[02:22.440 --> 02:26.040]  So no, whatever happens, we will never give up.
[02:26.040 --> 02:27.360]  We will never surrender.
[02:27.360 --> 02:35.400]  We will never back down to the satanic, pedophile, globalist, new-world order, and their walking
[02:35.400 --> 02:41.120]  dead, reanimated corpse, Joe Biden.
[02:41.120 --> 02:44.680]  And we will never recognize him.
[02:44.680 --> 02:50.400]  President Trump had zero connection to Russians, no proof, four years of investigation, with
[02:50.400 --> 02:53.360]  the Biden's hits open and shut.
[02:53.360 --> 02:58.680]  So I don't know who's going to the White House in 38 days, but I sure know this.
[02:58.680 --> 03:06.400]  Joe Biden is a globalist, and Joe Biden will be removed one way or another.
[03:06.400 --> 03:15.880]  He is a fraud, he is a doddering, senile individual that can barely talk, like General Hayden.
[03:15.880 --> 03:19.280]  Notice you don't see Hayden out and about much more these days, because he had a major
[03:19.280 --> 03:21.240]  stroke that has trouble talking.
[03:21.240 --> 03:23.680]  And I don't wish that on the worst of people.
[03:23.680 --> 03:30.320]  But if I say Hayden's expiration date is up, like the rest of this rotting political establishment,
[03:30.320 --> 03:39.000]  that means that your rotting physical condition is emblematic of your system being rejected
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.400]  worldwide.
[03:40.400 --> 03:45.240]  You raped our rights with illegal spying, you supported Obama and his illegal drone murders
[03:45.240 --> 03:46.240]  that he brags about.
[03:46.240 --> 03:50.560]  You know, when Obama says, I killed a lot of people two weeks ago who were innocent,
[03:50.560 --> 03:53.920]  but I'm all for it, that's real people he killed at weddings.
[03:53.920 --> 03:58.400]  When Apple helps run big giant death camps in China, with millions of Muslims, Christians
[03:58.400 --> 04:01.600]  and Buddhists in it, that's real death camps.
[04:01.600 --> 04:07.240]  But the left fawning over the NSA and the FBI, the CIA, oh, the thousands, tens of thousands
[04:07.240 --> 04:13.120]  of tweets, just arrest Jones, kill Jones, get him, put him in prison, he threatened
[04:13.120 --> 04:15.000]  our president.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.480]  Let's get one thing straight, Hayden.
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.120]  If I wanted to threaten President-elect through fraud, Biden, I would just say it, but I don't
[04:24.120 --> 04:31.360]  want violence against him, because that edifice, that husk being up there damages the globalist
[04:31.360 --> 04:32.800]  in your entire system.
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.280]  The only way you could get success is if you guys killed Biden and made him a victim.
[04:38.280 --> 04:44.000]  So the last thing I want is one little hair on that skeleton man to be harmed.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.720]  I actually hope and pray that he and Pelosi and all of you, all right, you can see this
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.560]  full report at Band-Aid video.
[04:51.560 --> 04:56.320]  It's very important, but coming up, an even more important report dealing with civil war
[04:56.320 --> 04:57.320]  then I'll be live.
[04:57.320 --> 04:59.320]  Hey, Steve, how you doing?
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.320]  Hey, Alex.
[05:00.320 --> 05:01.320]  Oh, my God.
[05:01.320 --> 05:04.320]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[05:04.320 --> 05:10.120]  Look, in January 2016, I went in the hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise, and
[05:10.120 --> 05:14.520]  I was in there until June, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[05:14.520 --> 05:15.520]  defense.
[05:15.520 --> 05:16.520]  Let me tell you something, man.
[05:16.520 --> 05:21.800]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years, and the
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.720]  doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is.
[05:25.720 --> 05:29.280]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.280]  you know what?
[05:30.280 --> 05:32.080]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.280]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it.
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.440]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.440]  taking it.
[05:40.440 --> 05:43.520]  Man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.080]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though, anybody who's traveled
[05:47.080 --> 05:53.000]  overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[05:53.000 --> 05:54.000]  It's true, folks.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.040]  We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality, and living defense is over the top
[05:58.040 --> 06:16.960]  got big brother, mainstream media, government coverups, you want to stop tyranny?
[06:16.960 --> 06:26.480]  And so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:26.480 --> 06:31.740]  To accept who is really in charge of America, we need to know who they really are.
[06:31.740 --> 06:36.240]  Because those in charge aren't occupying the three branches of government we pay our taxes
[06:36.240 --> 06:41.440]  to maintain, and they clearly aren't representing the sanctity of free and fair elections after
[06:41.440 --> 06:47.200]  the Supreme Court just sunk the final knife into the back of our constitutional republic.
[06:47.200 --> 06:52.680]  126 House Republicans and Attorneys General from 17 other red states had urged the court
[06:52.680 --> 06:57.760]  to take the case, but the justices tonight rejected it saying Texas has demonstrated
[06:57.760 --> 07:01.920]  no legal interest in how other states conduct their elections.
[07:01.920 --> 07:08.280]  Mr. Trump accused the justices of quote, letting us down, showing no wisdom and no courage.
[07:08.280 --> 07:13.640]  This after the court's 7-to-2 ruling rejected a push from Texas to block electors in four
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.160]  battleground states from voting in the Electoral College.
[07:17.160 --> 07:22.520]  In rejecting the lawsuit the court wrote, Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable
[07:22.520 --> 07:26.480]  interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.
[07:26.480 --> 07:32.200]  Meanwhile, the election fraud the establishment claims to be blind to is becoming increasingly
[07:32.200 --> 07:34.000]  creative and corrosive.
[07:34.000 --> 07:41.240]  It's pretty simple, those who have the responsibility and run for the job of making our laws must
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.680]  follow our laws.
[07:42.680 --> 07:47.900]  Aug referencing Richard Bonton and Natasha Deming, one a real candidate, the other a
[07:47.900 --> 07:52.840]  fake one who tried to claim she is a Latina woman named Natasha Ruiz.
[07:52.840 --> 07:55.760]  The information contained in these documents is false.
[07:55.760 --> 08:00.440]  Bonton and Deming ran in the Democratic primary for House District 142.
[08:00.440 --> 08:01.680]  The objective?
[08:01.680 --> 08:03.960]  Take out longtime incumbent Harold Dutton.
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.600]  The intent was to defraud the voters in House District 142.
[08:08.600 --> 08:14.400]  Approximately 2,500 people voted for Ruiz, forcing Representative Dutton into a runoff
[08:14.400 --> 08:15.400]  with another candidate.
[08:15.400 --> 08:18.720]  As far as the charges go, there are three felonies.
[08:18.720 --> 08:22.360]  Felonies for tampering with a government document as well as misdemeanors for election fraud
[08:22.360 --> 08:23.560]  and perjury.
[08:23.560 --> 08:24.800]  But there's more.
[08:24.800 --> 08:29.520]  This man Damien Jones, a Democratic political consultant, also charged.
[08:29.520 --> 08:35.640]  He's accused of threatening then-state Representative Gina Kalani of District 132 in an effort to
[08:35.640 --> 08:37.520]  keep her out of her race.
[08:37.520 --> 08:45.680]  The texted threat was intended to coerce Representative Kalani into resigning and not running for
[08:45.680 --> 08:51.160]  reelection, which then would have opened up that House District.
[08:51.160 --> 08:56.120]  And the GOP could have done a lot more to support our election integrity, but they didn't.
[08:56.120 --> 09:00.040]  President Trump said recently a big win is coming in the state of Georgia.
[09:00.040 --> 09:02.600]  That's after he said a sham was underway there.
[09:02.600 --> 09:04.240]  Do you know what he's talking about?
[09:04.240 --> 09:10.040]  No, I know that we are going to do a risk limiting audit, which will trigger a full statewide
[09:10.040 --> 09:11.320]  recount.
[09:11.320 --> 09:14.840]  This is the new America we are free falling into.
[09:14.840 --> 09:20.240]  The billionaires have increased their wealth by 30 percent in 2020, while Middle America
[09:20.240 --> 09:21.800]  has been decimated.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.300]  This is Jeff Bezos.
[09:23.300 --> 09:26.240]  He is the richest person in the world.
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.680]  Back in 2017, he became the world's first center billionaire.
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.480]  That's a net worth of a hundred billion U.S. dollars.
[09:32.480 --> 09:36.560]  And having made tens of billions during the coronavirus pandemic, that figures now a whole
[09:36.560 --> 09:37.560]  lot more.
[09:37.560 --> 09:38.560]  How is that even possible?
[09:38.560 --> 09:45.440]  It's incumbent upon all of us to recognize soberly that COVID-19 is not going away anytime
[09:45.440 --> 09:46.440]  soon.
[09:46.440 --> 09:50.960]  The decision leaves Lam and other business owners wondering how they'll survive.
[09:50.960 --> 09:56.080]  Like her, many have already exhausted their paycheck protection program funds that helped
[09:56.080 --> 09:58.160]  them get through the first shutdown.
[09:58.160 --> 10:01.880]  It's like we're jumping into a pool that doesn't have water.
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.640]  A recipe for hyperinflation and an oncoming third world reality.
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.640]  This as the incoming administration will ignore the needed recovery time and money needed
[10:11.640 --> 10:18.040]  to restore 60 percent of America's failing small businesses, but at the same time boasting
[10:18.040 --> 10:22.120]  the passing of a $12 trillion reparations package.
[10:22.120 --> 10:27.240]  If you elected president, would you sign that bill if it came across your desk?
[10:27.240 --> 10:34.400]  When I am elected president, I will sign it.
[10:34.400 --> 10:40.560]  As the far left pushes them into a $10 to $100 trillion green new deal, that will definitely
[10:40.560 --> 10:43.800]  put middle America in its grave.
[10:43.800 --> 10:46.680]  Let's get a read on something else that's catching a lot of people's attention.
[10:46.680 --> 10:51.160]  This green new deal that according to a guy who used to run the Congressional budget off
[10:51.160 --> 10:56.160]  as Douglas Wells Eakin, he put a pen to paper, started crunching things with spreadsheets
[10:56.160 --> 11:00.000]  and all of that and said it could be $93 trillion in all of that.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.600]  Look, FDR's new deal sounded great, it created tons of jobs.
[11:04.600 --> 11:10.640]  This one proposed to do the same, but it sounded so expensive and I just knew that it was going
[11:10.640 --> 11:12.320]  to be in the trillions.
[11:12.320 --> 11:15.840]  Now we know it's going to be possibly up to $93 trillion.
[11:15.840 --> 11:21.800]  So strategically speaking, the people who come out on the top on this are moderate Democrat
[11:21.800 --> 11:26.440]  presidential candidates like Klobuchar who said this is aspirational, but I don't know
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.520]  how we're going to get there.
[11:27.520 --> 11:31.120]  It's no wonder that the calls for a secession are gaining steam.
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.680]  The chairman of the Texas GOP, Allen West, released a statement on the court's decision
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.920]  saying this decision will have far-reaching ramifications for the future of our constitutional
[11:40.920 --> 11:41.920]  republic.
[11:41.920 --> 11:46.640]  For years, law-abiding states should bond together and form a union of states that will
[11:46.640 --> 11:48.560]  abide by the Constitution.
[11:48.560 --> 11:50.440]  An age of tyranny is upon us.
[11:50.440 --> 11:55.320]  Joe Biden will lead us into the Great Reset, reopen the border, and seriously restrict
[11:55.320 --> 11:56.440]  the Second Amendment.
[11:56.440 --> 12:02.520]  But it's likely that old Joe won't last through 2021 after leaks like this are championed
[12:02.520 --> 12:04.080]  by the corporate cratic media.
[12:04.080 --> 12:08.680]  Out of people in our community, I get a little anxious because they are not seeing enough
[12:08.680 --> 12:11.880]  of the progress they thought they would have seen at this point.
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.560]  Let's not disappoint them, and let's not get to a place where voters in Georgia began
[12:17.560 --> 12:18.560]  the second gas.
[12:18.560 --> 12:20.120]  Let's get something straight.
[12:20.120 --> 12:21.280]  You shouldn't be disappointed.
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.000]  What I've done so far is more than anybody else has done this far.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  Okay?
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  Number one.
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.640]  Number two, I mean what I say when I say it.
[12:30.640 --> 12:33.640]  I mean what I say when I say it.
[12:33.640 --> 12:40.760]  I'm the only person who's ever run on three platforms that I was told could not possibly
[12:40.760 --> 12:44.440]  win the election, and I never ceased from it.
[12:44.440 --> 12:50.960]  One was on restoring the soul of this country because of what I saw happen in Charlottesville.
[12:50.960 --> 12:51.960]  That was it.
[12:51.960 --> 12:53.920]  No one else was talking about it.
[12:53.920 --> 12:56.320]  The words of presidents matter.
[12:56.320 --> 13:00.040]  Nobody else, no progressive, was talking about it.
[13:00.040 --> 13:01.480]  I did.
[13:01.480 --> 13:06.720]  Now that your vote has been debased through open fraud, you really have no other choice
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.640]  as an American other than to organize as a massive resistance against the Biden-Harris
[13:12.640 --> 13:19.320]  Chinese corpocratic insurgency that will be voted in by the Electoral College on Monday.
[13:19.320 --> 13:21.320]  John Bowne reporting.
[13:21.320 --> 13:29.280]  That's a very powerful report he cut Sunday that we never got to, so we went ahead and
[13:29.280 --> 13:32.920]  aired that now, not because I don't have a lot of news, but because it was so important
[13:32.920 --> 13:34.840]  and that's the big topic.
[13:34.840 --> 13:39.720]  I want to put out to you today and I want to open the phones up and I want to ask you,
[13:39.720 --> 13:44.160]  do you understand or do you think your neighbors and friends and family understand what this
[13:44.160 --> 13:47.280]  globalist-communist revolution is going to look like?
[13:47.280 --> 13:51.680]  It's going to look like past communist revolutions with a high-tech overlay, and so I'm going
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.040]  to try to be as judicious as I can today to lay out what that future is going to look
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.280]  like so people understand how dystopic it is and how the more they promise all this
[14:00.280 --> 14:03.960]  free stuff, the worse things are going to get, and that's a historical fact.
[14:03.960 --> 14:08.080]  These are big megabanks offshore, they've done this to other countries countless times.
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.200]  This is a formula where people in 10 years will not recognize the United States, help,
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.320]  not in a year, but it's just going to get progressively worse because the globalists
[14:17.320 --> 14:23.480]  will sit offshore extracting everything for 20, 30 years, so we totally go back to road
[14:23.480 --> 14:27.240]  warrior-like scenarios, then they'll come back in, restabilize it, and build it back
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.560]  up.
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.200]  But if we don't have a chance to save the Republic, now is the time to begin your exits.
[14:33.200 --> 14:36.800]  The problem is it's a global government nowhere really to run.
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.240]  There's usually a few safe spots for the globalist, and if you've got a lot of money you can go
[14:41.240 --> 14:44.200]  to those places, but in the future if they don't like your politics they're not going
[14:44.200 --> 14:45.200]  to let you in.
[14:45.200 --> 14:50.720]  So this is a real hunger games scenario that all matters what sector, what region you're
[14:50.720 --> 14:51.720]  living in.
[14:51.720 --> 15:00.440]  This is all a world government plan with 34 days left until they install their front
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.320]  man, Biden, who said, you know, I've run on something nobody else ever ran on, communism,
[15:05.320 --> 15:07.640]  and he finally won by fraud, they're saying.
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.600]  I've not given up, we shouldn't give up, we need to keep fighting to expose the fraud
[15:10.600 --> 15:14.440]  of the election, Trump is 100% right, we're going to look at all the latest developments
[15:14.440 --> 15:20.320]  on that as well, and I've got a really huge announcement coming up at the bottom of the
[15:20.320 --> 15:26.000]  hour about the future of Info Wars, and about this organization and a restructuring we're
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.680]  going to be doing that will be announced today.
[15:28.680 --> 15:32.240]  I've waited long enough and I've told folks about how we're under attack, what's going
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.440]  on with Info Wars, and I don't think people take that serious sometimes, but Info Wars
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.160]  is fighting for its life, just like the rest of the country and the rest of the world is,
[15:42.160 --> 15:46.600]  we don't get globalist money, we didn't get the $10.6 billion that Black Lives Matter
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.280]  got from the New World Order, and the only money we get is from you, and we can't fight
[15:51.280 --> 15:54.720]  if you don't support us, well, they're right back, stay with us.
[15:54.720 --> 16:00.840]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[16:00.840 --> 16:01.840]  Hello, can you hear me?
[16:01.840 --> 16:02.840]  I sure can, sir, thank you.
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.480]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[16:08.480 --> 16:09.480]  be talking right now with you, man.
[16:09.480 --> 16:11.480]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[16:11.480 --> 16:16.560]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver, and two
[16:16.560 --> 16:22.160]  before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[16:22.160 --> 16:29.680]  of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull
[16:29.680 --> 16:33.960]  and Rolla, and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar, and I just
[16:33.960 --> 16:35.160]  want to thank you for that, man.
[16:35.160 --> 16:39.760]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[16:39.760 --> 16:43.440]  there is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his
[16:43.440 --> 16:46.560]  name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for
[16:46.560 --> 16:50.400]  this formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest,
[16:50.400 --> 16:54.200]  but healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.200]  that means a lot to me, thank you.
[16:55.200 --> 16:57.880]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[16:57.880 --> 17:03.280]  The U.S. Postal Service tells InfoWars that as long as you get your order in by December
[17:03.280 --> 17:06.920]  18th, that we're able to ship it out, by that date, you will get it anywhere in the United
[17:06.920 --> 17:12.240]  States before Christmas, but listen, don't wait, do your shopping at InfoWarsTour.com,
[17:12.240 --> 17:14.720]  get great products, and fund the InfoWars.
[17:14.720 --> 17:19.440]  Now, at the most critical time, not just at InfoWars History, but this country's history,
[17:19.440 --> 17:21.280]  you have invested in InfoWars.
[17:21.280 --> 17:25.080]  You prayed for us, you've spread the word, you've bought the products, and you've gotten
[17:25.080 --> 17:30.360]  the benefits of the information warfare, of the truth, in the fight against the globalist,
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.680]  but now is the time to redouble all our efforts in praying for a great awakening, which is
[17:34.680 --> 17:40.920]  starting to happen, and spreading the word about InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.video,
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.200]  and at the very same time, buying amazing products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[17:45.200 --> 17:49.640]  We have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly on some
[17:49.640 --> 17:53.720]  items, the biggest sales of the year, on New Pursuiticles, you name it, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[17:53.720 --> 18:00.680]  So thanks for your support, get those orders in, and God bless.
[18:00.680 --> 18:18.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:18.640 --> 18:31.320]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show, so has Trump
[18:31.320 --> 18:41.280]  lost the election for the globalist Havis to Haas, you got me, to Haas match, do they,
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.280]  do they have us?
[18:42.280 --> 18:51.320]  Well, I think it's like saying this Moby Dick have Captain Ahab.
[18:51.320 --> 18:53.920]  I think we basically have each other.
[18:53.920 --> 19:00.200]  We're in a death battle, a tightness war, and Trump is swinging for the fences, Trump
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.600]  tried to turn our economy back on, get us out of the globalist system, he did really
[19:03.600 --> 19:09.720]  a splendid job on many fronts, made some big mistakes, and still with 34 days left,
[19:09.720 --> 19:16.880]  if he levels with the American people in resolute desk speeches, and asked for 10 million Americans
[19:16.880 --> 19:22.280]  to march on Washington peacefully, and to march on all our other capitals to demonstrate
[19:22.280 --> 19:26.440]  that we know there's massive election fraud, and that we repudiate the globalist corporate
[19:26.440 --> 19:33.040]  media, the NWO has a very good chance of folding up and backing down, because then the Justice
[19:33.040 --> 19:38.760]  Department and others will have the courage to do the right thing and prosecute.
[19:38.760 --> 19:43.680]  You see federal raids that the media tried to say didn't exist this weekend, now confirmed
[19:43.680 --> 19:49.680]  on this big server farm run by the DNC and the Democrats tied to the elections.
[19:49.680 --> 19:52.240]  Solar winds, now confirmed.
[19:52.240 --> 19:59.280]  You see all these Jeffrey Epstein associates being arrested in Canada and in France the
[19:59.280 --> 20:03.480]  last two days, the latest is a major associate of Jeffrey Epstein was arrested in France
[20:03.480 --> 20:08.080]  on sex charges, he was trying to fly out of the country according to French media, Jean
[20:08.080 --> 20:14.280]  Luc Brunel was arrested at the Rossi airport as he was trying to board a flight to Senegal,
[20:14.280 --> 20:19.200]  a country in West Africa, which was once a French colony.
[20:19.200 --> 20:23.480]  Modeling agent and former closest associate of Jeffrey Epstein, Jean Luc Brunel was arrested
[20:23.480 --> 20:27.520]  in Rossi airport as he was trying to leave, guess who else was arrested?
[20:27.520 --> 20:34.440]  Peter Nygaard with his own little personal sex dungeon island in the Caribbean.
[20:34.440 --> 20:41.840]  It's the same stuff over and over again, these guys are the pimps for the globalist deep
[20:41.840 --> 20:44.440]  state.
[20:44.440 --> 20:50.080]  And the fact that they're being rolled up shows you that there is a giant internal globalist
[20:50.080 --> 20:55.120]  conflict going on between those that want the nation states and those that don't want
[20:55.120 --> 20:59.760]  total evil and destruction of the West and those that are signed on to this planetary
[20:59.760 --> 21:02.920]  dictatorship nightmare dystopia.
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.720]  So there is a lot of hope and there's a big awakening to globalism and we've already
[21:06.720 --> 21:15.760]  come so far in a deadly match like this, a gladiatorial event, you're going to have most
[21:15.760 --> 21:21.200]  of the contest where both opponents get hurt really bad, only one comes out on top.
[21:21.200 --> 21:26.120]  So if you had to look at this as a 12 round boxing match, we're about six rounds in Muhammad
[21:26.120 --> 21:31.640]  Ali versus Frazier and you can't really tell who's winning here.
[21:31.640 --> 21:37.720]  So it comes down to stamina and energy and focus and will or the eye of the tiger, total
[21:37.720 --> 21:38.720]  commitment.
[21:38.720 --> 21:44.240]  You're not there thinking about winning the fight, you're winning the fight.
[21:44.240 --> 21:50.680]  It's that zone you got to get in spiritually, culturally, and it means everywhere I go.
[21:50.680 --> 21:57.240]  I tell people about the HIV virus and many of the vaccines everywhere I go.
[21:57.240 --> 22:02.640]  I'm walking down the street and I see 30 black people walking down the street in DC and I
[22:02.640 --> 22:07.760]  walk right up and I say, listen, I need to know there's a global depopulation operation
[22:07.760 --> 22:11.120]  and blacks are being targeted and these vaccines are tailored to attack you.
[22:11.120 --> 22:12.120]  Read these reports.
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.120]  They say, really?
[22:13.120 --> 22:16.480]  And I hold my phone up and show them the reports, pissing off the globalists like no one has
[22:16.480 --> 22:17.480]  ever seen.
[22:17.480 --> 22:21.160]  That's why they're calling for my arrest all over the news.
[22:21.160 --> 22:25.280]  It's why media matters is calling for my arrest saying I'm going to kill people by exposing
[22:25.280 --> 22:29.520]  the vaccine saying that there's nothing wrong with any vaccines even though I have all the
[22:29.520 --> 22:31.680]  proof and all the evidence right here.
[22:31.680 --> 22:35.200]  And for me telling black folks and white folks and everybody else that it's not a virtue
[22:35.200 --> 22:39.720]  signal, I'm not going to just be on the radio or TV.
[22:39.720 --> 22:43.600]  I'm going to be at the grocery store, I'm going to be at church, I'm going to be on
[22:43.600 --> 22:48.120]  the streets, I'm going to be on the hiking bike trail, I'm going to be in the gas stations,
[22:48.120 --> 22:53.680]  I'm going to be at the auto parts store, I'm going to talk to everybody in the restaurants
[22:53.680 --> 22:57.640]  and I'm going to do it and it's never going to stop and when you do it, we will override
[22:57.640 --> 23:00.840]  the enemy and it'll be done.
[23:00.840 --> 23:07.240]  George Soros is taking over our law enforcement, our prosecutors, our DAs, our attorney generals.
[23:07.240 --> 23:14.800]  He's taking over our food, he's taking over the vaccines, he's taking over all the censorship.
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.320]  And he funds Black Lives Matter and tricks the public into giving Black Lives Matter
[23:18.320 --> 23:26.720]  $2.6 billion and they've got numbers out on it where about 98% of it goes to rich white
[23:26.720 --> 23:30.040]  billionaire men.
[23:30.040 --> 23:36.640]  While bizarre, obese, Marxist, Leninist witches, the three founders are witches.
[23:36.640 --> 23:44.600]  They do black magic rituals on TV saying they want the blood of innocents and then they
[23:44.600 --> 23:48.800]  divert their money to their Satan master Soros.
[23:48.800 --> 23:56.400]  I mean, this is all about total deception and total evil.
[23:56.400 --> 24:03.920]  And Info Wars, I'm giving you the goodness, Info Wars has three to five times the audience
[24:03.920 --> 24:07.520]  on a day-to-day basis that we've ever had except for right around the last election
[24:07.520 --> 24:09.480]  and that's a spot on the platform.
[24:09.480 --> 24:17.000]  What we do not have is the funding we had then and so I'm the type of guy that has kept
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.440]  everybody employed, kept the shows going, kept us in the field, kept funding everything,
[24:22.440 --> 24:29.560]  mortgaged my house a year ago to be able to have emergency funding to run this operation,
[24:29.560 --> 24:32.760]  to take care of shortfalls.
[24:32.760 --> 24:39.000]  But I can look at the other things I have as an emergency backup and it wouldn't fund
[24:39.000 --> 24:45.000]  this place for a month if I had to liquidate everything I've got because this is a big operation,
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.080]  our own satellites, our own IT, our own feeds, our own everything, all the DNC lawsuits against
[24:50.080 --> 24:51.080]  this, everything.
[24:51.080 --> 24:53.080]  We were supposed to be off air a long ago.
[24:53.080 --> 24:55.760]  Now's the most important time for us to be on air ever.
[24:55.760 --> 24:58.800]  So I thank you and I appreciate you coming up to me in the street and shaking my hand
[24:58.800 --> 25:05.720]  and saying I love X2, I love DNA force, I love turbo force, I love bodies, I absolutely
[25:05.720 --> 25:12.640]  love alpha power, I love supermal vitality, I had one of the crew members over here tore
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.920]  his leg, had some medical stuff, went to the doctor, they wanted to put him on stuff for
[25:18.920 --> 25:24.080]  his low, low T, he didn't do it, got tested again, he came in on Monday or Tuesday, he
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.520]  said look at this, I got tested, started taking supermal vitality and look at my numbers,
[25:28.520 --> 25:29.520]  it was incredible.
[25:29.520 --> 25:32.360]  I had to check with lawyers if we could even show you this stuff because you know the system
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.360]  is so corrupt, you're not supposed to even know what herbs can do, but that's the type
[25:36.360 --> 25:42.480]  of things that are happening and that are going on and I'm just here to tell you and
[25:42.480 --> 25:45.720]  you've come through over and over again, I keep telling you, we can't keep operating,
[25:45.720 --> 25:50.080]  we can't keep doing it at this level, if you don't support us, if you don't pray for us,
[25:50.080 --> 25:55.000]  if you don't spread the word, we're way more hardcore than Newsmax, OAN, everybody else
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.400]  and I love them, I hope they get more hardcore than I am and I like OAN, you know we're on
[26:00.400 --> 26:07.400]  cloud TV, number one and that's the same folks as the cloud that are the same folks as OAN
[26:07.400 --> 26:12.920]  and so they're great people and we're bringing them along, you're bringing them along, but
[26:12.920 --> 26:16.920]  we need your word of mouth and we need your financial support and your prayer now more

[26:55.920 --> 27:00.040]  During our war for independence during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the
[27:00.040 --> 27:03.680]  man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our constitution
[27:03.680 --> 27:07.360]  later said, look this is not going to be an easy fight, we're not going to be transported
[27:07.360 --> 27:14.040]  liberty on a bed of feathers, no ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible successes
[27:14.040 --> 27:18.440]  with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the liberty movement worldwide, we're going to have major
[27:18.440 --> 27:23.440]  setbacks but there is a giant awakening happening, that's what the globalists have gone ahead
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.520]  and launched their great reset, global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking app,

[27:55.400 --> 28:02.000]  The Post Industrial World, that's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.520]  de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992, now they've launched Agenda 2030 which is
[28:09.520 --> 28:14.360]  a post industrial world plow schwa with the Debo's Group, Trudeau the Prime Minister
[28:14.360 --> 28:20.720]  of Canada, they're all on record saying the great reset is Agenda 2030, well you might
[28:20.720 --> 28:26.400]  want to find out what Agenda 2030 is, it is the destruction of society as we know it,

[28:55.400 --> 29:00.240]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would, they've always been part of the
[29:00.240 --> 29:04.640]  establishment and it's only going to get worse, if they're able to keep Trump from
[29:04.640 --> 29:09.800]  rightfully taking office for second term on the 20th, the system is going to drop the
[29:09.800 --> 29:14.360]  hammer harder than ever on this republic, they're going to explode gas prices, they're
[29:14.360 --> 29:17.800]  going to shut down our coal power plants, they're going to cut off the energy source
[29:17.800 --> 29:23.080]  to the US, so it's impossible for factories to move back here, this is economic domination,
[29:23.080 --> 29:27.440]  this is economic war, we are being consolidated, we are being taken over, the democrats aren't
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.040]  mismanaging their blue cities and states, they're consolidating power and control to
[29:32.040 --> 29:37.000]  bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.480]  all the infrastructure and property, this is a monopolistic takeover, that's what the
[29:41.480 --> 29:46.520]  great reset is, clow Schwab and these other criminals admit it, that's what social distancing
[29:46.520 --> 29:52.840]  is, so your business is only at 25% for several more years, no small businesses will be there,
[29:52.840 --> 29:58.120]  this is a master plan, say no.
[29:58.120 --> 30:17.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:17.040 --> 30:43.960]  Okay, so let's go ahead and lay it out, this country is under attack, this country is being
[30:43.960 --> 30:49.640]  absorbed by world government and everything you saw before this was just a prelude, was
[30:49.640 --> 31:05.240]  a probe, was a beta test, now things are going to go into high gear and if you don't submit
[31:05.240 --> 31:12.000]  to the system, they're going to come after you and those of us that are prominent and
[31:12.000 --> 31:19.240]  fighting it are going to be gone after first and we've already been under major attack
[31:19.240 --> 31:23.560]  here at hundreds of different levels and because of your support and your prayers, we've been
[31:23.560 --> 31:28.000]  able to stay on air.
[31:28.000 --> 31:34.480]  But the cultural upheaval they plan to trigger and the economic degradation they plan to
[31:34.480 --> 31:43.000]  accelerate is so criminal that just sitting back and calmly taking all of this is something
[31:43.000 --> 31:49.640]  that we can't do, this is not business as usual, I talked about that in a live feed
[31:49.640 --> 31:59.360]  I did in DC last Saturday and I said it's just not normal even to do a radio show about
[31:59.360 --> 32:04.400]  this or a TV show to keep just talking about it, the fact that there's HIV virus in the
[32:04.400 --> 32:09.040]  main vaccine in Australia and they had to cancel 50 million dosages of it because it
[32:09.040 --> 32:14.960]  was creating a positive HIV test and the fact they tried to spin that as oh it's just the
[32:14.960 --> 32:22.640]  dead virus, it's not a problem but it's a live virus vaccine shows you how incredible
[32:22.640 --> 32:30.120]  this is and the normal behavior would be to run down the street screaming warning people
[32:30.120 --> 32:37.160]  and so I said on Joe Rogan's show five weeks ago I said I thought about retiring and the
[32:37.160 --> 32:42.560]  media thought that was just Joe trying to act like he's this reluctant hero but that's
[32:42.560 --> 32:45.320]  not what it is.
[32:45.320 --> 32:50.640]  I only dream about this stuff 90% of the time, used to 5% of the time.
[32:50.640 --> 32:58.200]  I have basically no life other than this, it's all I do and I still feel like I'm not doing
[32:58.200 --> 33:01.880]  enough but I'm not going to quit and it is extremely stressful.
[33:01.880 --> 33:06.800]  You see presidents who go into office and in six months their hair is gray because they're
[33:06.800 --> 33:11.560]  having to look at thousands of data points and make thousands of decisions a day and
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.560]  that will kill you.
[33:12.560 --> 33:16.920]  Now I don't want to liken myself to a US president but this job is about as close as
[33:16.920 --> 33:21.560]  it gets, looking at all the intel reports, talking to all the experts, talking and vetting
[33:21.560 --> 33:26.880]  information, working long hours, really caring about people, being informed, trying to promote
[33:26.880 --> 33:34.040]  policies that are the best for everyone and that are fair and just and good and empowering
[33:34.040 --> 33:37.920]  and then you have the huge guilt that you're not doing a good enough job and then you see
[33:37.920 --> 33:42.440]  other people that think it's all funny or it's a joke or who are Monday morning quarterbacks
[33:42.440 --> 33:49.240]  who know how to do it all just perfectly but never put their skin in the game.
[33:49.240 --> 33:55.320]  So it's been the greatest pleasure of my life 27 years on air knowing all of you and fighting
[33:55.320 --> 34:00.440]  the new world order and doing all of this and I'm not going anywhere yet but you need
[34:00.440 --> 34:02.000]  to know a new chapter here.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.280]  You know when I tell you that the CIA follows us around and the FBI and the Secret Service
[34:07.280 --> 34:11.360]  now and they come and sit down next to us at the restaurants and tell us that they come
[34:11.360 --> 34:16.400]  visit us at the hotel and turn our cell phones off so we can't videotape them and that you
[34:16.400 --> 34:21.600]  know the former director of the CIA comes out and says he wants me arrested on Twitter.
[34:21.600 --> 34:27.200]  That isn't me scared that's not me afraid that's just info wars entering a new chapter
[34:27.200 --> 34:34.640]  of life just like you're entering a new chapter of life and so I'm here to tell you that I'm
[34:34.640 --> 34:40.920]  not going to back down and I'm going to do exactly what I think is the most moral and
[34:40.920 --> 34:50.720]  best thing to do and that starts with not being a nice guy anymore not not not being
[34:50.720 --> 34:59.120]  delusional about where we stand and what we can do and the fact that I have this tendency
[34:59.120 --> 35:08.680]  to never even shake up things in my own operations because I'm so loyal even though to the point
[35:08.680 --> 35:15.520]  of our operation not being able to function and so I pledge to you that I'm going to work
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.040]  harder in the fight against the new world order and I'm asking you to fight harder against
[35:19.040 --> 35:24.160]  the globalist but I've already explained to you we had to let Caitlyn Bennett go because
[35:24.160 --> 35:28.440]  we couldn't pay her anymore we had to let Millie Weaver go and in God bless Caitlyn
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.320]  Bennett she hasn't made up a bunch of stuff about us as we let her go you've seen what
[35:32.320 --> 35:39.240]  Millie's done God bless her it's okay she did a lot of great work in the past you think
[35:39.240 --> 35:47.440]  I enjoyed doing that Paul Watson he's off on his own but Paul still is a team player
[35:47.440 --> 35:53.880]  and does a great job but he understands but I've got this great crew in here that's busting
[35:53.880 --> 35:57.440]  their ass I mean three four years ago when I still had plenty of money I was funding
[35:57.440 --> 36:01.760]  dozens of organizations dozens of groups were doing great work I was taking the money you
[36:01.760 --> 36:05.440]  sent us buying products and sending it out where I thought it was key to fight the new
[36:05.440 --> 36:12.680]  world order I'm down to funding three or four organizations outside of our own operation
[36:12.680 --> 36:21.560]  now I've been cut back to a hill I'm on and I'll die on this hill but everybody sits
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.800]  here and hears me say that you don't think I'm serious so we're gonna have to reorganize
[36:25.800 --> 36:30.080]  and we're gonna have to rethink what we're doing I'm gonna stay on the air four hours
[36:30.080 --> 36:34.400]  a day so is over three hours a day I've got a council the nighttime election countdown
[36:34.400 --> 36:39.000]  show just because there's not the crew there's not the funds there's not the money and we're
[36:39.000 --> 36:45.400]  going to reorganize some of the other shows and then revamp them and relaunch them because
[36:45.400 --> 36:51.360]  I never give up but I can't give out it's like an old horse your horses will run and
[36:51.360 --> 36:57.160]  run and run till their heart blows up any good horse will run till its heart blows won't stop
[36:57.160 --> 37:03.320]  you keep running a horse it'll go till it dies and you know I've met a physically but
[37:03.320 --> 37:11.040]  also physically got to that point I can't stop working I've got to take a week off I've
[37:11.040 --> 37:15.560]  got to turn everything off I've got to do it and and it doesn't matter where the middle
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.560]  of the shine battle because I know when smoke's coming out of the race car engine you got
[37:19.560 --> 37:24.760]  to pull over and get it get it get oil put in there so I thank you all for your support
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.360]  and I love you and I appreciate you and I and I the last straw was this morning I got
[37:29.360 --> 37:35.440]  up and I saw this number Black Lives Matter raised 10.6 billion since May when you go
[37:35.440 --> 37:39.120]  in a coffee shop like Starbucks or anywhere and they say give it to Black Lives Matter
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.320]  that's just the communists and the globalists and sorrows collecting money the DNC on record
[37:43.320 --> 37:48.240]  got 4 billion of it of the 10 billion last time I checked look how much the DNC got of
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.280]  that that was a few months ago that was 4 billion that I'd read they'd gotten who knows
[37:52.280 --> 37:56.360]  what it is now of the 10.6 billion so and by the way these are old numbers you know
[37:56.360 --> 37:59.520]  numbers always come out a few months after so a few months ago they'd already raised
[37:59.520 --> 38:06.800]  10.6 billion dollars 10.6 billion dollars to run around and say America sucks white people
[38:06.800 --> 38:13.880]  are evil burned down America communism's good and it's all Jeff Bezos and and Mark Zuckerberg
[38:13.880 --> 38:17.880]  these weird creepy people that hate everybody that are well known for not helping their
[38:17.880 --> 38:23.320]  employees or even giving tips you can be an employee one of these guys I mean they'll
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.360]  do nothing to help you and they're monsters but you know what Bezos doubled his money
[38:28.360 --> 38:33.800]  this year Black Lives Matter made 10.6 billion dollars to piss on America's grave and I'm
[38:33.800 --> 38:38.720]  sitting here barely able to pay the bills and run this operation and we're as big as
[38:38.720 --> 38:42.120]  it gets in the fight against the globalists we have bigger numbers than news backs bigger
[38:42.120 --> 38:46.520]  than OAN bigger than all of it and God bless and I wish those groups were bigger than us
[38:46.520 --> 38:54.400]  and and we're sitting here and we have your support and that's it so I intend to redouble
[38:54.400 --> 38:57.480]  my efforts actually I'm going to take off a few days of Christmas and then I'm going
[38:57.480 --> 39:00.720]  to come in here and I'm going to do even more shows and fight even harder and get even more
[39:00.720 --> 39:06.520]  focus for you in this critical time but I just ask you to remember that if you do your
[39:06.520 --> 39:11.960]  shopping at a big box store and on a mom and pop if you're watching CNN instead of listening
[39:11.960 --> 39:17.280]  local radio stations spread the word if you're buying your products from Amazon said infowarstore.com
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.520]  then you might as well just jump off a cliff because these people are out to get you the
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.600]  great reset is on record agenda 2030 to get rid of all the middle class and all the small
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.040]  companies just do your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com and we'll expand but if
[39:31.040 --> 39:38.160]  you don't we'll contract and so we're reassessing right now and info wars is contracting ahead
[39:38.160 --> 39:43.040]  of a big offensive now I'm gonna decide whether it's our big last offensive or just the next
[39:43.040 --> 39:50.400]  of many but I promise you this we'll go out in a fiery inferno of liberty in a peaceful
[39:50.400 --> 39:58.880]  operation of total victory.
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.720]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot well info wars is why hot
[40:03.720 --> 40:09.280]  right now world government globalist forces trying to take over the United States is mainstream
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.160]  news and info wars credibility has gone through the roof that's why now is the time to contact
[40:15.160 --> 40:20.160]  local radio TV and cable stations if you don't have an affiliate in your area already and
[40:20.160 --> 40:25.440]  to send them to info wars.com forward slash affiliates and say pick up Alex Jones pick
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.360]  up Owen Shroyer pick up David Knight pick up her other great programs they're free to
[40:29.360 --> 40:33.960]  air if you're on TV or you're on cable you can cover up all the commercials for yourself
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.440]  no contracts needed this is your authorization stations pick up the info wars feed right
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.720]  now all the affiliates the satellites it's all linked at info wars.com forward slash
[40:43.720 --> 40:48.640]  affiliates go to the local stations call them email them and send them the link to info
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.200]  wars.com forward slash affiliate and tell them we're free to air no contracts just pick
[40:53.200 --> 40:59.880]  us up Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism. Other dictionaries
[40:59.880 --> 41:04.200]  have somewhere else. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.960]  a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit
[41:10.960 --> 41:16.200]  to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the headlines
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.280]  from CNN ABC News doctors say it's worse than they ever thought COVID more devastating than
[41:21.280 --> 41:26.800]  ever imagined. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight
[41:26.800 --> 41:32.560]  months ago within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million if you count all of the
[41:32.560 --> 41:37.520]  people that died of other things. We're talking 96% had co-morbidity. These are real numbers
[41:37.520 --> 41:42.000]  these are real facts. This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses never
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.800]  come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over
[41:45.800 --> 41:51.640]  the planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you could
[41:51.640 --> 41:59.040]  put up with and survive. We're witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[41:59.040 --> 42:03.720]  The United Nations the big corporations the globalist big tech and big farmer all pushing
[42:03.720 --> 42:07.880]  the covers most deadly thing in history even though statistically it's a very weak flu
[42:07.880 --> 42:12.320]  or cold. But if you are deficient then you can actually die from it. That's why you
[42:12.320 --> 42:18.000]  should be dying inside the nursing homes. Meanwhile all these top scientists and researchers
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.920]  and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine
[42:22.920 --> 42:26.880]  especially the mRNA ones are basically bio weapons that are super deadly. And now they're
[42:26.880 --> 42:31.760]  having to resuscitate people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies
[42:31.760 --> 42:35.000]  they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.320]  let them die. And that's on the record it does that Guillain-Barre's narcolepsy cancer
[42:40.320 --> 42:43.680]  all these other diseases but they tell you safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.440]  a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess can kill you absolutely deadly. So
[42:48.440 --> 42:52.080]  they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something that is incredibly dangerous
[42:52.080 --> 43:05.920]  because the media says it's safe they do it.
[43:05.920 --> 43:12.160]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with
[43:12.160 --> 43:17.080]  your Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the
[43:17.080 --> 43:22.600]  menu comes up you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app.
[43:22.600 --> 43:28.920]  I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.600]  Tim Cook tried to stop it. The globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit
[43:32.600 --> 43:37.640]  of action you can override them have the app and then tell others about it so they can
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.800]  get the app. So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share
[43:41.800 --> 43:46.840]  buttons below on your email on Facebook on Twitter on YouTube however you want be sure
[43:46.840 --> 44:12.000]  to share band.video.
[44:12.000 --> 44:32.240]  We got a big broadcast lined up for you in the next few hours. Professor Francis A. Boyle
[44:32.240 --> 44:36.560]  is really upset as we now learn that one of the main vaccines the mRNA vaccine was created
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.560]  by DARPA and was already prepared years ago which we already basically knew that came
[44:41.560 --> 44:45.400]  out. They had all sorts of these COVID type vaccines ready on the shelf. This is part
[44:45.400 --> 44:50.880]  of a bigger rollout really sinister. We are learning from top medical firms and top scientists
[44:50.880 --> 44:57.600]  that we've cited here that they are jacking with the vaccines, that they are having characteristics
[44:57.600 --> 45:04.880]  that reduce fertility, that cause autoimmune disorders, that can cause your immune system
[45:04.880 --> 45:09.840]  to go haywire with an ecytosine storm and now you see people being hospitalized all
[45:09.840 --> 45:17.320]  over the world when they start taking the COVID-19 vaccines. That's in the news today.
[45:17.320 --> 45:22.520]  But paradoxically media matters and CNN and all the other Soros satanic mouthpieces say
[45:22.520 --> 45:28.760]  oh no. Jones is insane. He needs to be arrested. No one's sick. There's no side effects. I'm
[45:28.760 --> 45:34.000]  going to show you media matters saying just that coming up next hour. And then Cassandra
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.200]  Fairbanks couldn't come on yesterday. She was in the mountains and her internet went
[45:37.200 --> 45:43.720]  down. She's the main liaison with Julian Assange. We're talking about pardons with Cassandra
[45:43.720 --> 45:48.140]  Fairbanks and then former Navy SEAL best-selling author of Great Patriot Matt Bracken in the
[45:48.140 --> 45:59.320]  fourth hour ahead of the war room. Okay. Let's get into it right now. Look at these headlines
[45:59.320 --> 46:08.520]  concerning the takeover. Mexico's president slams lockdowns as a form of dictatorship.
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.360]  Well William Barr called it the greatest form of dictatorship since slavery. I mean when
[46:12.360 --> 46:15.800]  you're locked in your house and you're cold, you're non-essential and your business goes
[46:15.800 --> 46:20.280]  bankrupted and now they're coming saying they got forced inoculations and then they act
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.560]  like oh it's weird. It's crazy. Arrest Alex Jones. He says they might hurt you. This
[46:25.560 --> 46:40.760]  is just next level. So I like Andres Manuel Lopez Orbador. He's a socialist but he is
[46:40.760 --> 46:45.740]  a real socialist and by that I mean he's a populist socialist and is actually trying
[46:45.740 --> 46:49.880]  to get higher wages for people and trying to get corporations to actually not be tax
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.360]  exempt. I don't agree with that model long term but he met with Trump. He actually liked
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.720]  Trump once he heard what Trump wanted to do was make poor people wealthy. He's come out
[46:58.720 --> 47:01.800]  and said he thought the election may have been stolen from Trump because he's had an
[47:01.800 --> 47:08.680]  election stolen from him and now he's saying we should not do a second lockdown. This kills
[47:08.680 --> 47:12.880]  our people and is much worse than the virus which it is. I mean the UN admits tens of
[47:12.880 --> 47:16.080]  millions are starving to death. Millions have already starved to death. Hundreds of millions
[47:16.080 --> 47:19.600]  could starve to death. Billions are going into poverty and they're calling it because
[47:19.600 --> 47:27.680]  of the virus no because of the lockdown. The popular leader known as a mellow by a supporter
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.840]  said that COVID-19 lockdowns were fashionable among authorities who want to show they are
[47:32.840 --> 47:38.760]  heavy handed dictatorship. Well yeah remember what Justin Trudeau said. He said I love China.
[47:38.760 --> 47:42.560]  They're not the best dictatorship. I want to be a dictator. I mean this is look it's
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.600]  out and he said we want agenda 2030 to be like China. That's where they decide who stays
[47:47.600 --> 47:53.080]  open who doesn't. That's martial law ladies and gentlemen. Super hard core martial law
[47:53.080 --> 47:59.800]  where some stay open some don't. Wow. A lot of them are letting their authoritarian
[47:59.800 --> 48:08.760]  instincts show he added noting that the fundamental thing is the guarantee of liberty. And I must
[48:08.760 --> 48:16.000]  say in that right I always get names right wrong. Orbitor. Yep. Also insisted that mass
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.760]  wearing should be voluntary. And not mandatory by the state. Well I may have to move to Mexico.
[48:21.760 --> 48:28.000]  I'm serious. We're about to be worse in Mexico. I'm serious. As national file highlights other
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.200]  Latin American countries have imposed strict lockdowns. He has spoken out against stay
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.600]  at home orders although authorities in different regions have. For example the third most popular
[48:40.600 --> 48:45.760]  state in Mexico currently governed by the opposition left liberal citizens movement
[48:45.760 --> 48:50.960]  is there is a mass mandate in all public areas. Other states have gone further still
[48:50.960 --> 48:55.320]  introducing stay at home orders and shutting non essential businesses even state governed
[48:55.320 --> 49:01.880]  by coronavirus politicians such as the way we only own and others have adopted strict
[49:01.880 --> 49:08.120]  lockdown restrictions. So this is just insane. And Mexico will be collapsed if they don't
[49:08.120 --> 49:11.800]  keep their economy open and of tourism doesn't turn back on and they will get flooded that
[49:11.800 --> 49:18.480]  pay for it all and the cycle just continues on and on and on and on. He's got to come
[49:18.480 --> 49:24.240]  out and actually he has and say take your vitamins. This is just the same as the flu.
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.360]  We can't be scared of our own shadows. This is total crap. I mean as much sunshine as they've
[49:28.360 --> 49:35.160]  got Mexico they shouldn't have any problem with this virus. Wow. Continuing here Twitter
[49:35.160 --> 49:40.360]  says it will remove all post claiming vaccines can harm people. Steve Watson in fours dot
[49:40.360 --> 49:44.960]  com it says the vaccines are good. There's no problem. We listen to the UN and big pharma
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.200]  they actually say pharma companies tell us it's safe and effective. The insert says it
[49:50.200 --> 49:57.800]  give you narcolepsy, Guillain-Barre's cancer convulsions. Thousands of other types. I mean
[49:57.800 --> 50:03.720]  it's just pancreatitis. But oh sorry can't talk about what happens to your your daughter
[50:03.720 --> 50:10.400]  or your son. I'm going to show this video. You guys can cue it up. Fake shot. Local news
[50:10.400 --> 50:16.480]  heirs health care worker receiving empty vaccine and remember the Golden Globes two years ago.
[50:16.480 --> 50:21.080]  They did the same thing there with the flu shot with nurses coming out doing fake shots
[50:21.080 --> 50:28.360]  and later came out that it was a fake shot. Well we don't have that now we'll just play
[50:28.360 --> 50:35.360]  it next hour. Oh so we do have it. Go ahead and turn it up please. So roll up your sleeves
[50:35.360 --> 50:46.360]  Hollywood because you're all getting flu shots. You know you are saying we're down for a reason.
[50:46.360 --> 50:55.360]  Hey, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot. You're definitely going to want to get the phone.
[50:55.360 --> 51:12.560]  Now we have local NBC caught with a fake shot. There's nothing in the plunger. The plunger
[51:12.560 --> 51:19.640]  is all the way down. You can watch the video at infowars.com and doing fake shots. Why
[51:19.640 --> 51:25.400]  wouldn't you just give them a real shot? Watch this. Plunger all the way down. Nothing in
[51:25.400 --> 51:34.240]  the injector. Wow. Oh but I told you that health authorities would fake giving themselves
[51:34.240 --> 51:39.000]  shots because no one in the right mind wants to be sterilized and media matters said I
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.480]  should be arrested. What a group of sick evil criminals. You know over at media matters
[51:44.480 --> 51:48.200]  they're not taking any of the shots. Oh no they're not. So media matters put that in
[51:48.200 --> 51:54.760]  your pipe and smoke it. COVID-19 vaccine. Three groups of people who shouldn't get the shot.
[51:54.760 --> 52:02.200]  Under 16, pregnant women and people over 75. Oh but media matters says it's conspiracy
[52:02.200 --> 52:07.600]  theory that I warned people over 75 not to take it and then I cite a top scientist on
[52:07.600 --> 52:12.560]  the EU advisory board saying it's basically a euthanasia weapon and hurts the old more
[52:12.560 --> 52:17.200]  than anybody. Oh and now the British government agrees but media matters hope you don't look
[52:17.200 --> 52:23.960]  that up. Part of the criminal energy. Australia COVID vaccine terminated to HIV? False positives.
[52:23.960 --> 52:29.720]  Yeah false positives. Well it had part of the virus in it. No big deal. I told you it had
[52:29.720 --> 52:34.400]  the HIV virus in it 10 months ago because top prestigious universities came out and
[52:34.400 --> 52:41.960]  said it and I was the bad man media matters. George Soros said here's the article. Alex
[52:41.960 --> 52:50.520]  Jones, coronavirus vaccine conspiracy theories are a public health threat. And they go through
[52:50.520 --> 52:56.800]  all the false claims I make. Meanwhile, top scientists warns COVID-19 vaccine road to
[52:56.800 --> 53:01.400]  your doom. That's Fox News with top scientists on. Top EU scientists warns COVID-19 vaccine
[53:01.400 --> 53:04.920]  linked sterilization of women. I show the whole official report. COVID vaccines will
[53:04.920 --> 53:08.360]  target and destroy human reproductive systems. Show a mainline report by the Francis Boyle
[53:08.360 --> 53:12.240]  author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law. Bioweapons mRNA vaccines violate Nuremberg
[53:12.240 --> 53:19.560]  rules against illegal testing. They all attack all this real stuff because they're the authority.
[53:19.560 --> 53:25.880]  A majority of Americans are against the great reset of Klaus Schwab. It goes on and on. We'll
[53:25.880 --> 53:30.240]  start the next hour but please, I appreciate you all. Spread the word about the broadcast

[54:14.400 --> 54:18.880]  We follow all the rules. So they'll be able to throw me in prison. They're sure trying.

[55:40.320 --> 55:47.520]  or yourself at info wars store.com. The boat came out yesterday and announced a global government
[55:47.520 --> 55:52.480]  corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income,
[55:52.480 --> 55:56.480]  which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.600]  your phone and finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[56:01.600 --> 56:07.920]  UN great reset of the Davos group and cloud swab, all officially written about in hundreds of books
[56:07.920 --> 56:13.440]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them at 10 to 21 to 2030. It's here and
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.640]  only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[56:20.320 --> 56:24.720]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil,
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.560]  and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we
[56:30.560 --> 56:37.200]  are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that,
[56:37.200 --> 57:03.200]  we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[57:08.160 --> 57:14.080]  All right, Dr. Francis Boyle, author of the US biological weapons law. He'll be joining us
[57:14.080 --> 57:21.920]  next segment dealing with the fact that DARPA, we'll tell you those folks are, if you don't know,
[57:21.920 --> 57:25.840]  the advanced research laboratories, that's kind of the real shadow government of it all, the mad
[57:25.840 --> 57:30.960]  scientist, is in control of one of the major vaccines. In fact, guys, I had those articles
[57:30.960 --> 57:37.120]  yesterday where you reprint those for me. I have them here in my stack. I just can't find it. So
[57:37.120 --> 57:46.640]  that's coming up next segment. This is a corporate takeover, a global government corporate rape,
[57:46.640 --> 57:52.640]  where they're just launching untested illegal vaccines, waving the laws, waving the trials,
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.840]  then trying to cover up all the adverse reactions that are pouring out, calling for my arrest in
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.240]  the news because I'm scaring people and I'm going to cause a public health emergency.
[58:04.400 --> 58:09.840]  A public health emergency is them locking everything down and causing mass starvation
[58:09.840 --> 58:14.400]  and not telling people about vitamin D, vitamin C, other things. The emergency is them covering
[58:14.400 --> 58:20.080]  up the release from Wuhan and where it came from and Melinda Gates coming out and saying,
[58:20.080 --> 58:24.480]  oh, she didn't realize the economic crisis it would cause. I mean, this is crazy. And you see
[58:24.480 --> 58:30.560]  the motive is the big tech companies all have the biggest profit increases of their history.
[58:30.560 --> 58:38.240]  Several of them have had double, double their profits. But guess who made more in profit
[58:38.240 --> 58:46.720]  than Amazon? Black Lives Matter raised $10.6 billion since May. And when you hear Black Lives
[58:46.720 --> 58:54.880]  Matter, that means Soros. That means the Democratic Party taking groups inside the
[58:54.880 --> 58:58.960]  nation and the world and saying, if you're brown and you're in Europe or you're in the U.S.,
[58:58.960 --> 59:03.040]  you're owed something. White people are bad. This will break society for good.
[59:04.240 --> 59:11.360]  It's why you have to repudiate it. And these big corporations are just as nasty as they come.
[59:11.360 --> 59:15.840]  They want to have a universal guaranteed income that will get everybody on the dole so they can
[59:15.840 --> 59:20.320]  make you take vaccines. So when they tell you, Black folks, we care about you. We want to get
[59:20.320 --> 59:25.120]  you on a universal income. We want you to have the vaccine. It's because they're coming for you
[59:25.120 --> 59:28.960]  just like Tuskegee. But let me tell you, we've had scientists on. We've read the reports here
[59:28.960 --> 59:36.560]  on air. This attacks everybody as well. In fact, you guys go back into Monday or Tuesday stack.
[59:36.560 --> 59:42.000]  I had that Wolfgang Wudarg and also the other scientists, the former chief scientist at Pfizer,
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.880]  he coauthored it, the emergency report. That's got all the areas highlighted about the Pfizer vaccine
[59:47.520 --> 59:53.840]  and how they admit it could cause an autoimmune response or shut your immune system off or eat
[59:53.840 --> 1:00:00.160]  your placenta when you're forming it or just do. I mean, it's all right there. This is not even hidden.
[1:00:00.160 --> 1:00:04.960]  And then you've seen all the adverse reactions. It's totally insane. And now Mexico's president's
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:13.600]  come out and slammed what's going on. So we'll discuss it all with Dr. Boyle on the other side
[1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:19.920]  and how media matters is attacking him as well as myself. But it seems like they're losing
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:25.680]  the war to suppress where this is really going. I mean, how are they going to cover up
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:31.760]  all the people that get autoimmune compromised? How are they going to cover up people that have
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:35.920]  cytokine storms and have convulsions? Some fall down and hit their head and die. I mean, they've
[1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:47.120]  got, I've got articles out of California, out of Michigan, out of Alaska where nurses that are
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:52.160]  being given because their front line are collapsing and having convulsions and having to be put in
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:58.640]  the hospital. I mean, here's another example. Why last week did the British government say,
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:03.520]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, if you have an allergy to anything, peanuts, penicillin,
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:11.040]  bumblebees, bees, wasps, you know, just a whole list of things, do not take the COVID vaccines
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.400]  because they had a lot of people get sick in the hospital. And now they say, you got to give the
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:24.240]  shot in a hospital with defibrillators. So you can't have just the nurse or just the pharmacist
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:28.960]  at Walgreens or CVS or whatever they got, you know, there in the UK, similar stores,
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:33.680]  I've been in drug stores there. It looks just like Walgreens. You can't take that in there. You've
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.440]  got to go to a hospital or a clinic because they got to be able to resuscitate your ass. You know,
[1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:42.720]  that means restart your heart, restart your lungs. Back in 60 seconds from Dr. Francis Boyle, stay with
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:59.920]  us. The Post Industrial World. That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de
[1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:08.160]  Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992. Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:13.200]  industrial world plows swat with the Davos group. The Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:20.960]  saying the great reset is Agenda 2030. Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:26.800]  is the destruction of society as we know it. It is making the population poor by designs. We can
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:33.840]  be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family. They're destroying civilization,
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:41.360]  rebuilding and they're dystopic image. We are fighting this at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[1:02:41.360 --> 1:02:46.880]  We are fighting for a pro human future and we need you to get the facts, to research and share
[1:02:46.880 --> 1:03:04.560]  with others and join the fight. God bless you. Visit us, spread the word at infowars.com.
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:17.520]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday,
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.880]  December 17 worldwide broadcast. Dr. Francis A Boyle is the author of the U.S. Biological
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:29.760]  Weapons Law, also a major advisor on the UN World Weapons Treaty. And we're routinely in contact
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:34.320]  with him and he was very upset about articles that came out in the last few days showing DARPA's
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:40.240]  relationship with some of the main vaccines that are now being approved and rolled out on the public.
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:47.280]  And so we're really not pleased to have him on. We wish that this wasn't unfolding. We wish this
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:51.120]  wasn't happening. We're going to talk about why that's so important. Go back to the big developments.
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:58.560]  They suspended the 50 million vaccines that were being deployed there in Australia because people
[1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:03.040]  were coming up as positive for HIV. They said, oh, well, there's part of the HIV virus in there.
[1:04:03.040 --> 1:04:07.040]  Just don't worry about it. We told you that 10 months ago, Dr. Boyle warned of it then.
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:11.040]  So now they're really trying to cover up this thing. It's almost like an exercise in
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:18.640]  too able to fail. Roll this out. People get sick. You get vaccine immunity, not from the disease,
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:25.200]  but the vaccine makers get immunity. This seems like a very self-destructive rampage by big tech
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:31.200]  and big pharma together. All the censorship that we see Dr. Boyle taking place. I mean,
[1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:35.440]  this is just a mess. This is a disaster. What's really going on here?
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:42.560]  Well, obviously, we've been talking about this since February and just to narrow it down,
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:49.840]  I think the most important thing we can do now is to stop the vaccines. It's going to kill people.
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:56.000]  You saw now there have been three casualties over in Britain. Apparently, it hasn't killed them.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:03.200]  But even the New York Times had today, what happened to this health care worker in Alaska,
[1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:09.680]  this Pfizer vaccine would have killed her if not for the fact that they could put her into
[1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:21.680]  an ICU unit, ICU unit, intensive care unit. So it's very clear the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine funded
[1:05:21.680 --> 1:05:30.800]  by Bill Gates is going to kill people. Yesterday, well, I got the information, as you know, today,
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:42.960]  the FDA is going to be approving the new Moderna vaccine. The Moderna vaccine is based on the
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:52.080]  exact same biotechnology that the Pfizer vaccine is based upon. And now I've been able to determine
[1:05:52.080 --> 1:06:02.400]  definitively that it was the Pentagon that set up and financed and funded the Moderna vaccine.
[1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:12.400]  And in particular, that was the DARPA Defense Advanced Research Program. And they are the
[1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:22.800]  spearhead of the U.S. Offensive War Program across the board, not just biological weapons,
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:30.160]  chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, and every other weapon you can take. Now, let's go through,
[1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:39.760]  this is Moderna's own press release. And remember, the Pfizer vaccine that's being distributed now
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:49.040]  involves the exact same technology, okay? So it says RNA therapeutics. We've discussed this before.
[1:06:49.760 --> 1:06:58.240]  Messenger RNA is the basis of this. It's like putting a bomb into your body. And it will
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:05.040]  genetically rearrange the decomposition of your body. And you've already had people on there
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:14.880]  talking about what's going to happen and the side effects. But let me go through this press release
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:21.520]  and interpret it to you. I apologize. I have it here on another computer. So I will have to...
[1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:33.200]  Yeah, that's fine. Please continue. Right. So yeah, Messenger RNA tapped directly into the
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:41.120]  body's natural processes. That's right. That's exactly what they're doing with this Pfizer
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:59.760]  and Moderna vaccine. Let me continue here. All right. Here is the kicker at the end.
[1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:10.640]  That DARPA program called ADEPT PROTEC developed platform technologies. That's what these two
[1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:20.960]  vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna are all about. Can be deployed safely and rapidly to provide
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:28.160]  the U.S. population. Notice they are going after all of us, the U.S. population. That's what it says.
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:37.760]  And again, quote, emerging infectious diseases, unquote. Right. They are emerging out of U.S.
[1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:51.440]  biological warfare laboratories, such as BSL4s and BSL3s, including the Wuhan BSL4 that worked
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:59.360]  with the UNC BSL3. We've already discussed it before. So when they talk about emerging infectious
[1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:06.400]  diseases, they're the ones doing the emergencies. And so then they say, and Alex, you have to
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:14.480]  understand, when it comes to biological warfare weapons development, first you develop the biological
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:22.880]  warfare weapon itself. And that is done at these BSL3s, BSL4s, like University of North Carolina
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:31.200]  and the Wuhan BSL4. But then there is the problem of blowback, which they also provide for. So then
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:40.320]  to deal with the blowback, they then go out and try to develop so-called vaccines to that they
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:47.840]  think will counteract the blowback. So notice this is part of offensive, defensive, dual-use
[1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:54.720]  bio-warfare weapons development. And by the way, let's just go back for a moment and explain why
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.880]  this is so important. You were on here 10, 11 months ago laying all this out, predicting it,
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:02.480]  showing the evidence. They went there. They created it. They moved it from Chapel Hill,
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:09.840]  Obama, and Fauci. We found all these patents for a similar COVID-19 bat hybrid with gain of function,
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:15.840]  HIV. We laid all this out. You said, looks like it leaked. But they were already ready. They used
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:21.600]  this for a power graph. China is using this to shut us down. I mean, to me, more and more,
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:26.000]  the whole thing was completely premeditated. And then Klaus Schwab is saying they're using
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.480]  this to bring in a corporate world government, the medical dictatorship. And as you said,
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:36.320]  you've got the Pentagon admitting that they've been developing these emergency and emerging
[1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.800]  diseases. So they would, quote, have treatments for the crisis they created. I mean, this just
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.960]  looks like open and shut beyond Nazi Nuremberg war crimes here right now.
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:52.400]  Well, it says, as we discussed before, this is a Nazi mentality at work. There's no question
[1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:59.520]  about it. But let me just continue analyzing this press release by Moderna. So it says,
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:06.960]  against emerging infectious diseases, yeah, those emerge out of BSL threes and BSL fours,
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:14.080]  like the Wuhan BSL four, and for Dietrich BSL four, and down there near where you are, the
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:21.440]  Galveston BSL four, which by the way, the Chinese bat queen from Wuhan was over there down in
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:27.840]  Galveston and Galveston Galveston's involved in research development testing stockpile of every
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:34.560]  hideous biological warfare weapon you can possibly imagine. So that is against emerging
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:44.320]  infectious diseases and engineered biological weapons. Right. That is because these BSL threes
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:50.240]  and the BSL fours are engineering. If that's exactly right, they know exactly what they're
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:58.880]  doing. DARPA is funding this at quote, even in cases when the pathogen or infectious agent is
[1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:06.400]  unknown. Uncle, that's right. It's unknown because they are still in the process of research developing
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:18.640]  and testing. We know that I think it's a CDC or NIH. They have sent their scientists all over the
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:30.240]  world to look for any type of bacteria, fungus, virus, toxin that can be used to research develop
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:34.880]  tests, biologically. That's right. They're bringing all the worst bio weapons that naturally occur
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:39.920]  occurring labs back and then cooking them up. And when they escape, they take over our society as
[1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:46.400]  the saviors and then inject us with rapid reaction mRNA systems that take over our bodies entire
[1:12:46.400 --> 1:12:48.960]  genetics. A corporate global government takeover. Stay with us.
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:21.200]  New Year's resolution as well. It's got the grapefruit seed extract. It's got the grape seed
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:26.240]  extract. It's called organic black walnut leaf and stem. The regular black walnut when it's green
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:31.520]  from the whole organic olive leaf, organic neem leaf, organic ginger root, and so much more.

[1:14:50.320 --> 1:15:07.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:21.200 --> 1:15:26.800]  You can't tell me with the timing of what went down with Trump and China
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:32.480]  and the power grab and the great reset and the lockdowns and now all these adverse reactions
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:36.800]  from the vaccines. They're not vaccines. They're this takeover of your very genetic code.
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:42.480]  But this wasn't premeditated. And we know they were developing these mRNA vaccines. We know the
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:46.320]  DARPA was secretly funding them. Now there's Justice Department investigations into them not
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:50.560]  disclosing that to the Securities and Exchange Commission and others, because this is a big
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:55.120]  governmental insider deal going back to Obama, going back to Fauci. Trump obviously learned
[1:15:55.120 --> 1:16:00.240]  about it later, went along with it. I think that's a big black mark on President Trump. But Dr. Boyle,
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:04.080]  author of the U.S. Biological Weapons Law, this is just deja vu of everything you said 10 months
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:09.920]  ago now proven. But explain to people why this is such a bombshell. I mean, this just says premeditation,
[1:16:09.920 --> 1:16:17.040]  doesn't it? Right. Alex, I did want to add one thing here. You showed in your ad there
[1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:23.680]  the suffering of U.S. armed forces. And that's correct. I've worked against the
[1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:33.440]  Gulf War Syndrome as well. You see right here in this press release that Moderna DARPA have admitted
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:41.680]  this is a biological warfare weapon vaccine. And we have a history here. We have track
[1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:49.840]  experience of what happened. I told you before I helped defend Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn,
[1:16:50.400 --> 1:16:59.040]  who likewise refused to give experimental anti-bio warfare vaccines for anthrax and
[1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:07.280]  vigilant in violation of the Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation. Now, at the end of all
[1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:18.080]  that, it produced these vaccines, the Gulf War Syndrome. And of 500,000 U.S. troops were inoculated,
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:28.640]  and it killed about 11,000. And it disabled about 100,000 out of 500,000. And let me say,
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:34.880]  I haven't looked at those numbers in a while because I haven't really done work legally
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:43.840]  with GWS. I have given some veterans some pro bono advice on that. This is the one track record
[1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:56.000]  we have with an anti-bio warfare vaccine that poisoned our troops. Well, here, if you see
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:18:04.320]  from the press release, they're going to inflict an anti-bio warfare vaccine on the entire United
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:14.400]  States population. So again, we will see, I think, casualty figures that you can extrapolate
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:23.280]  from our troops that were victims of the Gulf War Syndrome. 500,000 inoculated, 11,000 dead,
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:34.720]  100,000 disabled. So extrapolate that to the entire American population of 330 million people,
[1:18:35.760 --> 1:18:45.920]  likewise being injected with experimental biological warfare vaccines in violation of the
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:50.240]  Nuremberg Code on Medical Experimentation. And of course, they're going to inflict these,
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:57.520]  they're going to order our troops to take these as well. And this will be the Gulf War Syndrome
[1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:07.600]  on steroids for the entire American people if we let them get away with this Pfizer vaccine
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:16.080]  and also the Moderna vaccine. And again, as I said before, FDA was involved in developing
[1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:24.160]  COVID-19 right there at the UNC BSL-3. It's all there in the article, along with...
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:28.960]  So they're all, they're all colluding. They're all involved. And you have been exposing this for
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:34.400]  decades. They admit tens of thousands died from the vaccines. Tens of thousands got sick and died
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:40.960]  from the Spanish flu or swine flu thing in the 76. Why are they doing something so reckless
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:45.360]  and so crazy to test and see if they can cover up the aftermath or just normalize,
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:47.440]  killing us? I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:57.840]  Well, you know, I told you, I went through that exact same PhD program at Harvard that
[1:19:58.400 --> 1:20:04.560]  produced Kissinger before me. And to get a PhD like that from Harvard, you have to know all about
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:15.760]  the origins of World War II and the Nazis. And again, I am not exaggerating here to say
[1:20:16.400 --> 1:20:23.600]  this is a Nazi mentality at work. And I guess you're a viewing audience. They are very bright,
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:28.800]  very bright, intelligent people. I hear from them all the time. I try to, they're very polite to me.
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.960]  I try to respond to them as best I can. They're going to have to draw their own conclusions here.
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:42.640]  But yes, and remember Kissinger was in that exact same program before me at Harvard. Harvard is
[1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:50.640]  involved in the Wuhan BSL for helping develop COVID-19. And you have that national security
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:21:00.320]  directive that Kissinger did for Nixon saying population reduction and control are national
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:04.960]  security objective of the United States. I've never heard that that it's been revoked.
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:10.640]  So let's expand on that Obama's White House science are John B. Holder and wrote the book
[1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:16.800]  Eco Science. The same year that that memorandum was published, 74 the year I was born, 46, 47 years
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.720]  ago and called for it. What do you make of Soros and media matters attacking you and I and saying
[1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:28.400]  that we're liars that 80% of people with one of the vaccine tests got sick. Bill Gates admitted
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:33.680]  that and saying that you're lying that this is a bio weapon vaccine. I mean, they now admit that
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:40.640]  from the press release. Right. The press release makes it very clear. It was funded by DARPA
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:47.920]  as a bio warfare vaccine. Right. You know, what can I say? Alex, I guess this just means that
[1:21:48.640 --> 1:21:56.240]  you and I are partners in crime against the global onus. And I teach against global onus in my
[1:21:56.240 --> 1:22:03.360]  course on international human rights. I train my law students against it. And explain what
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:08.000]  global onus, explain what global onus global onus is. They're baloney of the globalist.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:22.480]  Right. Stieglitz, who wrote globalization and its discontents admitted, yes, I was there
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:32.000]  with Larry Summers and Bob Rubin and me to develop global globalization.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:40.880]  And also, yeah, I was Bob Rubin for Wall Street and the banks and Bill Clinton.
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:45.120]  That's right. I've actually read his book and I've gotten Joseph Stieglitz on a couple times,
[1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:48.400]  Nobel Prize winner. Let's do a half of another segment and all you've got to go and I've got
[1:22:48.400 --> 1:22:52.480]  a bunch of news about globalism, the big picture and being one of the few people who was ever
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:57.360]  inside that it wasn't part of it. What we can do to say no to this. And of course, you've written
[1:22:57.360 --> 1:23:00.880]  quite a few books. What do you think the most important book is for people that want to find
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:12.640]  your books and read them? Well, as a practical matter to resist these vaccines, which I think
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:20.240]  the agenda here is quite clear. What effect inflict Nazi vaccines here on the entire American
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:28.320]  population quote, quote to provide the US population, unquote. So that's, that's the agenda.
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:38.880]  I have written a book called protesting power, war, resistance and law by Roman in Littlefield, Inc.
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:45.200]  2008. All right, stay there. Let's talk about big picture. Big picture. When we come back with
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:52.480]  Dr. Boyle, stay with us. During our war for independence, during some of the darkest days,
[1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:56.560]  Thomas Jefferson, the man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:24:00.880]  Constitution later said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight. We're not going to be transported
[1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:07.440]  liberty on a bed of feathers. No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible successes
[1:24:07.440 --> 1:24:11.920]  with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the Liberty Movement worldwide. We're going to have major
[1:24:11.920 --> 1:24:17.040]  setbacks, but there is a giant awakening happening. That's where the globalists have gone ahead and
[1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:21.760]  launched their great reset, global collapse, worldwide social credit score, tracking app,
[1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:26.640]  microchip, forced modulation takeover now. Because if they don't force it now, they're never going
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:30.880]  to get it. So info wars has never been more critical. I want to thank you all for your support.

[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:54.800]  Hey, Steve, how you doing? Hey, Alex. Oh my God. Long time listener, first time caller. Look,
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:25:00.160]  in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:04.880]  until June. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me
[1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:10.640]  tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.440]  six years. And the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is. And then
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:19.200]  every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what,
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:22.720]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed to have any
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:26.560]  nutritional stuff because they don't want you to have it. But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:32.160]  I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It
[1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:36.720]  saved my life. If there's any veteran out there, I don't give you travel though. Anybody's traveled
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:42.400]  overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:46.960]  It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality. And living defense
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:50.800]  is over the top good. The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you
[1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:54.960]  all now, if you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it. I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:00.320]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put Turboforce in my coffee. That was a crazy
[1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:04.400]  week. I don't remember sleeping. But as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite. And
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:08.160]  all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health,
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:13.680]  not relying on other people to do it for you. Nobody wakes up in the morning
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:18.320]  and thinks, I'm going to give that person over there a better life. I'm going to wake up today.
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:22.240]  You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier,
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:25.760]  happier, and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think
[1:26:25.760 --> 1:26:28.960]  that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.480]  said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way? There's
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:36.160]  only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know
[1:26:36.160 --> 1:26:39.440]  what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health. And that's
[1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:43.120]  why you need to go to Infowars.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:46.400]  Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turboforce.
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.080]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turboforce is good.
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:54.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:56.560]  So
[1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:09.600]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 3pm since I'm here live ahead of the warm of Owen Schreuer.
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:16.560]  How do Francis Boyle's, our guest for another segment, then I'm going to cover a bunch of other
[1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:21.680]  political breaking news with the campaign, the election with the economy and with globalism.
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:25.440]  And then we are joined by Cassandra Fairbanks, the Gateway pundit who is very close friends
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.840]  and really one of the main confidants of Julian Massange. He travels the U.K. routinely.
[1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.880]  He gets persecuted to be able to visit with him. Trump really needs to pardon Massange,
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:42.480]  or that's, you know, for me just another reason that he didn't understand the bigger picture and
[1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:46.800]  got destroyed by the globalists. But that's coming up. But if you're a long-time listener,
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:51.760]  you get what's going on. But a lot of new people, they hear this, they choose, oh,
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.760]  that's just them big and fair monsters. Dr. Boyle wrote the U.S. biological weapons law
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:28:01.440]  that's our current law. He's prosecuted war criminals at the Hague. He's a very famous lawyer,
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.720]  highest level. He went to the special PhD at Harvard that only one person a year goes through.
[1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:12.000]  He's in books on world government, the new world order and how they developed the planet
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:17.040]  Harvard, the current plan off Cecil Rhodes' previous plan. So he's just going ahead and telling you
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:21.840]  this stuff. This is not just somebody that read it in a book. He was there. You know, my dad was
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:25.680]  not at Harvard like he was. He was playing too at University of Texas, already at going to college
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:31.600]  when he was 15. And once he was 18 at the research laboratory, he's more on the scientific end,
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:35.200]  they called them in. Him and five others had told him a lot of the same stuff about world
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.440]  government and, you know, the scientific elite has a right to do this. And Hitler was wrong
[1:28:39.440 --> 1:28:43.120]  because he's eugenics only targeted certain groups. We're going to go after everybody.
[1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:47.680]  So I think that's where Dr. Boyle was going with just why this is so existential. Explain what
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:54.720]  existential means. Well, as before we get to that, let me just say that in response to your
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:29:01.520]  previous question, your listeners, I'm not trying to make money here, might want to get my book,
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:12.400]  protesting power, war, resistance and law. Okay. And it is basically manual written for lawyers,
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:18.880]  but I write in plain English. So I had ordinary people in mind, anyone, you know, with a high
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:28.560]  school education can read that book and see how to resist these Nazi Franken shots being used
[1:29:28.560 --> 1:29:35.680]  against you. And all you it's a general strategy thing. But all you have to do in my analysis,
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:43.440]  then, is plug in the Nuremberg code on medical experimentation. It's right there. Yeah. And
[1:29:43.440 --> 1:29:52.880]  that we plugged in with my defense of Captain Dr. Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn, who refused to give
[1:29:52.880 --> 1:30:03.760]  the Bio Warfare vaccines that produced the Gulf War syndrome. And Hewitt Vaughn, you know, was a
[1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:13.280]  real profit and a hero. She was convicted in a kangaroo court proceeding. And I was able to get
[1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:19.360]  her out of Leavenworth in eight months. She was adopted a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty
[1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:27.600]  International. What is a very sad commentary here, however, is that in go for one, when all of those
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:37.200]  500,000 us forces were forced to take those Nazi anti Bio Warfare vaccines in violation of the
[1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:43.680]  Nuremberg code on medical experimentation. To the best of my knowledge, Hewitt Vaughn was the only
[1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:52.960]  one to refuse to poison our troops. That's a very sad commentary on our medical doctors. But it was
[1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:58.400]  conscientious objectors like her and then the future waves of anthrac shots that actually got the
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:31:03.600]  program suspended. So the good news is previous programs you and others were at the heart of
[1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:08.240]  getting those those illegal programs suspended, which is now what you're saying is this violates
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:13.680]  the Nuremberg code. It violates the Geneva Convention. It violates every known common sense thing.
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:20.720]  They didn't even do animal studies. This is just a bum rush by big pharma to play God and literally
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:25.200]  have a corporate takeover of our very cells. You know, the left used to worry about Monsanto
[1:31:25.200 --> 1:31:30.720]  taking over corn and soybeans. I'm worried about that too, which this is our bodies. This is just
[1:31:30.720 --> 1:31:39.520]  such a leap forward, such a massive power grab. Right, Alex. And now these days, Monsanto has a
[1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:48.000]  BSL for in their corporate headquarters down there in St. Louis. So you can have a Bio Warfare
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:55.120]  agent like Ebola sprinkled on your Franken foods. I mean, why watch and by the way, Monsanto has
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:32:04.160]  now been taken over by the neo Nazis in a bear there in Germany, totally unreconstructed Nazis
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:08.960]  still running bear. It doesn't. You keep going back to Nazis. You're not kidding.
[1:32:10.560 --> 1:32:17.920]  Jean Claude, the head of the EU is literally the heir of the most powerful Nazi royal family and
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:22.480]  owns Luxembourg himself. And he's heavily invested in all this. I mean, you can't take this up.
[1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:31.120]  No, I, you know, it's sort of like, you know, Pogo, we've met the enemy and he is us. It's back.
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:39.040]  I had thought we had taken care of Nazism at the end of the Second World War. But as you know,
[1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:47.840]  we had a very active denazification campaign involved there. Let's put aside Operation
[1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:56.560]  Paperclip where we smuggle these people here in the United States and rat lines into Latin America.
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:03.760]  But because of the outbreak of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:12.720]  we stopped all denazification there in Germany. And there it is, we're still dealing with it today
[1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:19.760]  among ourselves. I mean, these people poisoned ourselves. We brought them over here, you know,
[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:25.680]  Werner von Braun, all the rest of them, and put them at the top of our scientific establishment.
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:29.680]  Who are the ringleaders? Who are the ringleaders? I mean, Bill Gates is the heart of it, the UN,
[1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:34.320]  but the UN even last December said in a hearing with the head of their vaccine program, they said,
[1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:38.800]  we're wobbly. Our daughters don't believe in it. We don't even test it. We're told what to do. It
[1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:43.840]  looks to me like their global vaccine program was collapsing. And this is all just a fail forward,
[1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:52.720]  too big to fail, smoke screen power grab, kind of like famous oil fire guys would use explosives
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:59.200]  like Red Adair to blow up an oil rig that was on fire, use an explosion to cover up the fire
[1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:04.480]  that you've got. It seems like that's what they're doing. Well, as we've discussed this before,
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:10.400]  with all due respect to you, you know, I do watch and read all the mainstream news media here in
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:15.760]  the United States and some in Britain. Right now they're succeeding. They're succeeding. They're
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:23.440]  getting away with it. They're going to be subjecting the entire US population with these Nazi
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:30.320]  frankenshots. So unless we stop them, they are succeeding right now as we speak. Despite your
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:36.960]  best efforts, Alex, and I commend you for trying to get the truth out here about what's going on
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:42.960]  since our first interview on this in February. Well, I'm just trying to warn people. It's just
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:46.480]  the right thing to do. And you're doing it too. And media matters. I mean, I read media matters.
[1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:50.400]  These are people, too. They write this whole article saying there's nothing wrong. The shots
[1:34:50.400 --> 1:34:55.920]  are totally healthy. It's all lies. Everything's fine. And then everything they claim we're saying
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:00.880]  we're true is true on record. I mean, this is just insane. I don't know how one group of
[1:35:00.880 --> 1:35:04.560]  media say there's no side effects. Everything's fine. Meanwhile, the British government says,
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:08.880]  don't take this if you have an allergy. It can kill you. Well, I mean, that's incredible.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:17.040]  And you have to have resuscitation sources available. And now we find out this poor healthcare
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:23.200]  worker up in Alaska, you have to be near an ICU unit, or you're going to die. Well, of course,
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:31.760]  they don't have ICU units in nursing homes. Around here, if someone's in a nursing home
[1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:37.680]  with a serious problem, they take them in an ambulance to a hospital. So we're going to be
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:43.280]  seeing large numbers of our senior citizens just killed off in these nursing homes. And it's very
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:51.200]  clear, even today's New York Times, there is no system for getting informed and voluntary consent
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:58.000]  from people in nursing homes as required by the Nuremberg Code of Medical Experimentation.
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.200]  And they've had months to set this up, and they haven't bothered because I don't think they
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.040]  really. It's like shipping COVID patients in to get half the deaths in New York and other areas
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:11.920]  of Pennsylvania from the nursing homes. This is all a test to see what they can get away with.
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:16.560]  Incredible. Dr. Boyle, thank you for your tireless work and just we really appreciate you.
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:22.800]  Well, again, Alex, thanks for getting me on. And please keep getting the message out. We do
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.880]  have to stop these Frankenshots. There's no other word for it. All right, God bless you, sir. We
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:32.480]  appreciate you. Okay, I got a bunch of breaking news on the economy and on what's happening with
[1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:37.920]  the communists taking over the Democratic Party and the upcoming expanded lockdowns and President
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:42.400]  Trump seeking special counsel, investigating Hunter Biden's crimes, so much coming up. And
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:47.440]  we've got another special guest, the founder of Fairbanks joining us.
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:57.520]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot. Well, info wars is white hot right
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:03.440]  now. World government, globalist forces trying to take over the United States is mainstream news.
[1:37:03.440 --> 1:37:08.800]  And info wars credibility has gone through the roof. That's why now is the time to contact
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:13.600]  local radio, TV and cable stations. If you don't have an affiliate in your area already,

[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:50.880]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:56.960]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:03.920]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:08.880]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:13.760]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:19.040]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people
[1:38:19.040 --> 1:38:24.800]  would be dead just eight months ago, within three months. Okay. It's a quarter million.
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:30.400]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:34.720]  These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event. We all run our
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:39.200]  houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential. All the big box stores in Amazon
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:45.200]  take over the planet. You could stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not something you
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.960]  can put up with and survive. The globalists have always been at war with the family and small
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:56.400]  businesses. They want control. They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:02.000]  place right now. And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.640]  that they are creating monopolies and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns,
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.440]  gun control, abortion, world government, all of it. If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:16.160]  But if you'll shop at InfoWars, where we have thousands of products made right here in America,
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:22.080]  with our warehouses and our crew, it's incredible and it changes the whole world. So do your shopping
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.240]  if you want to fund the InfoWars. If you want to stop the globalist at infowarstore.com
[1:39:26.240 --> 1:39:30.320]  and tell others to do their shopping at infowarstore.com. We have amazing products.
[1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:34.960]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th. So again,
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:38.400]  I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank you for thinking through what you do
[1:39:38.400 --> 1:39:42.400]  and where you spend your money and do your shopping and get great products at infowarstore.com.
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:54.800]  You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the very
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:59.760]  genetic code of the planet. The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.080]  But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.080]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:14.320]  through the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target,
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:20.880]  humanity with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA
[1:40:20.880 --> 1:40:29.440]  from aborted cloned fetuses who are then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:36.880]  systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:41.840]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:45.760]  little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:54.160]  overriding us. It's all the same in the end. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:41:10.080]  27 years I've been on air. 27 years.
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:23.280]  And I never take it for granted being on air. I get more humble as the years go on because it
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:29.680]  gets so much more dangerous. They didn't have that little globalist former head of the NSA and CIA
[1:41:30.480 --> 1:41:36.800]  Hayden come out and call for my arrest for no reason. They have been letting us know that
[1:41:38.320 --> 1:41:43.760]  they're in charge ever since they began to replace the Trump administration without his
[1:41:43.760 --> 1:41:51.360]  authorization and outside of law with their people. And so we are going into a
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:57.040]  storm, all of you are, all of us together, of biblical proportions.
[1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:03.680]  So let me make an announcement right here just to clarify something and then I'll get
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:08.640]  right into the news and then we have Cassandra Fairbanks again on the latest with Julian Assange,
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:15.280]  Jesus Confidant and more here today. And so here's the announcement. I've told listeners and I've
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:21.440]  explained this to everybody that it's not like we have an iPhone or a droid and then we dial in
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:26.000]  to Apple or Google or Facebook and they're hundreds of billions of dollars of equipment
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:32.400]  that make it all work so easy. We're old school even though we have the latest equipment in that
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:37.520]  we go directly to radio stations and TV stations. Remember back when radio and TV didn't watch you,
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:43.760]  you watched it, you listened to it. And so when you've got radio and TV satellite uplinks,
[1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:48.080]  when you've got all the encoders and the engineers and the computers and the software,
[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:52.560]  you come in here, people come in here and they go, wow, I've never seen a studio before with
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:59.200]  giant banks of computers and wires and all this. Well, that's because we have to do it all ourselves.
[1:43:02.080 --> 1:43:03.520]  And then when we go out and we
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:10.320]  lease the satellite a couple of times they've come to us and said,
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:16.080]  we don't like your politics. You can't even buy time on our satellite. There was a lawsuit by
[1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:20.240]  somebody else in that satellite got opened back up, now there's more competition. But I mean,
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:24.400]  we have media matters and others saying we'd be taken off the internet entirely that we shouldn't
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:28.240]  even be able to have our own website. They're tattling here in media matters saying, Jones has
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:35.040]  millions of viewers a day still, something needs to be done. So all I'm telling you is I'm a tough
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:41.680]  guy. And I don't complain and I don't whine about stuff. I do report to you how serious things are
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:46.960]  because as they get ready to forcibly inoculate you, that's coming. As they get ready to make you
[1:43:46.960 --> 1:43:52.880]  take a travel pass on a phone to even have a job. And as they prepare to permanently lock you down
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:58.080]  and release even more powerful bio weapons, this is all just a beta test. They're not going to want
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:04.640]  this on air. So I will stay here like Custard's last stand or the Alamo. I will stay here and
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:11.040]  stay here to the end or until they turn the lights out. But they're moving into the next phase now.
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:15.200]  And they're going to take your pension fund. They're going to take your kids. They're going
[1:44:15.200 --> 1:44:18.080]  to take your health. They're going to take it all because that's who they are. And you're like,
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:21.840]  why would they do that? Well, why the Soviets do what they do? Why did Hitler do what they do?
[1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:27.360]  Why did Mao Zedong do? Why does Pol Pot do what he did? It's the nature of evil. And when good
[1:44:27.360 --> 1:44:34.800]  people don't organize and stop it, it always takes over. And we're being over run by evil right now.
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:40.320]  So I started back, you know, six, eight months ago, the election countdown show.
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:44.480]  And I even told you it's going to run through into, you know, February or so because I think
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:49.520]  the election will be contested up to the 20th. And I said that we have the funds and the crew.
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:54.640]  We tried to hire more crew. We have some attrition. We will keep the show and call
[1:44:54.640 --> 1:44:57.840]  it something else at night because people want a nighttime show. And of course, you've had David
[1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:03.040]  Knight do a great job for nine years hosting the nightly news here. And then I guess six,
[1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:07.680]  seven years, whatever it is, is on morning show, big audience, a lot of great people, everything,
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:14.880]  you know, there. Well, at this point, we don't have the crew or the infrastructure or any of it
[1:45:14.880 --> 1:45:20.320]  to continue those shows. So those shows are, I don't want to say terminated or canceled.
[1:45:20.320 --> 1:45:26.160]  They're just, they're not there anymore. They're gone. And that's the way it is. So I've told
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:31.200]  everybody that because I've got to take the resources we've got. And I've got to believe me,
[1:45:31.200 --> 1:45:36.240]  I don't want to come in here at 6am every morning. I'm going to host the morning show and this one.
[1:45:37.200 --> 1:45:41.280]  But when I do it, it has the bigger audiences and brings in the capital to fund the operations.
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:46.800]  So I'm going to host a morning show. It's basically commercial free. It'll have like
[1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:50.800]  six minutes of ads an hour just for local stations. I'm going to take calls and play clips, very
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:56.720]  disciplined for three hours every morning. And then I'm going to do three more hours here.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:02.640]  Now I'll have some guest hosts and some people and I'll try to work it out. But David's a great
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:08.960]  guy, really smart. And I could tell he was burnout. And we have trouble having a big enough crew.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:15.200]  And so we're going to see whether that show even continues on with myself doing it. But for now,
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:19.680]  for the election, all that going on, I wasn't even going to announce that David's gone, but he put
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:27.840]  out a tweet saying that he has been fired. And I wouldn't really say fired. He was laid off,
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:33.760]  but yes, fired by Alex, effective immediately. So there you go. And that's just how this works because
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:42.160]  if people aren't happy and I can't make them happy, I've learned at this age in my life just to move
[1:46:42.160 --> 1:46:47.600]  on. And so we love David. He's a great guy. He's a great mind. I admire his intellect. I love the
[1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:51.920]  reports he's done. I like so much of what David's done. But David doesn't agree with a lot of my
[1:46:51.920 --> 1:46:56.800]  politics. Doesn't agree with my style. And you know, it's pulling teeth for him to be here. And
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.360]  it's really stressful. So we wish him well. Hope he keeps doing a show. Love to have him on as a
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:08.560]  guest sometime. Doors open. But that's that. Because we just don't have the crew. I barely
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:13.680]  have the crew to run my show. We barely have the funds to run things. And I need to be able to go
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:18.880]  out in the field and do live events. And I want to work seven days a week. And so for every reason,
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:22.960]  I've never been able to hire enough crew or get it done to have more than two people on the weekend.
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:27.920]  I need people to rotate through. I need five people so I can come up here with emergencies
[1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:32.000]  breaking because it might be that last Saturday, that last Sunday before they hit the internet
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:36.640]  kill switch and start mass arrest. I've got to be here when they come, folks. I've got to stay
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:44.480]  at my post to the end. This is a total war for me. And so the last straw is I was already thinking
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:48.960]  about laying folks off and cutting back to try to reorganize and then develop something new.
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:54.640]  But people never take it like that. Robert Barnes is a great guy. But, you know, we had trouble
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:57.520]  having enough crew about four or five months ago. I said, Hey, we're suspending the show for now.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:00.800]  And Bob really thought that we'd gotten rid of him. No, we were brought him back as soon as he
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:05.360]  got enough crew. And he said, Oh, really? You want to be back? Yeah. So with this next case,
[1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:09.840]  I'm just not even doing that. But the door is always still open. If I can get the funds,
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:16.240]  if I can get the crew without having them work 10, 12 hours a day, and then be burnt out,
[1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:21.440]  and then I've got problems on my show that brings in 10 times the audience of anybody else
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:25.760]  and funds the operation for whatever reason. I love the David Knight show. I love the
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:28.960]  war with Owen Stewart. I think they're better than I am. But this is the show with the hundreds
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:37.200]  of radio stations and TV stations. This is the show that gets it done. And so you've got my commitment
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:45.360]  to come in and to really focus and do the best job I can for you at least three days a week.
[1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:50.080]  Then we'll have Harrison Smith or whoever else. But I want to discipline this new morning show
[1:48:51.600 --> 1:48:57.120]  where we play a couple of clips every segment and we take five calls every segment. It's a call
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:01.920]  in show. We're going to call it American Journal, not Washington Journal, but American Journal,
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:06.720]  just like C-SPAN. And I think it's going to be a popular show. I think it's going to do it really
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:11.920]  well as long as, again, you've only got six minutes of breaks an hour for the local radio
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.520]  stations and TV stations will be commercial free. I can't do that with my show or I would
[1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:21.120]  because I'm in partnership with Ted Anderson still. He's a great guy, but I've thought about
[1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:26.800]  having to not do that deal with him anymore, not because I don't love Ted, but so I could cut back
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:31.200]  and tell stations, hey, eight minutes ads, whatever you want, you get all the ads. We get
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:34.400]  none of them. You get a lot more stations doing that because I understand they need that money
[1:49:34.400 --> 1:49:41.760]  from advertising. Things are really tough out there. So that's where we are. And I just hope
[1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:46.000]  that you will support us financially so we can either beat the globalist or give this a good
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:50.880]  finish. And, you know, I kind of envy David and I know he's probably relieved because he's,
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:55.200]  he gets ready for three or four hours every day before he does his show. And I'm sure he'll
[1:49:55.200 --> 1:50:00.080]  continue on and do his show at his own pace so that he can, you know, relax a little more with
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:05.280]  his great wife and family. So there you go. Buoy by Osh David Knight. And if you want to work with
[1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:10.320]  us any more in the future, we'd love to at your own, you know, style and way of doing it. If not,
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:14.720]  that's fine. It was a good nine years with you and we appreciate you. So everybody appreciate
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.960]  David Knight. Give him a round of applause for everything he's done. If you want to see us stay
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:24.560]  on air, I'm not playing around. I could sell everything I got and fund this place another
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:28.480]  two months. We got money right now to operate for a couple months. That's not enough of a cushion.
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:33.360]  So it gets me really, really nervous. Okay, so please spread the word about the broadcast, pray
[1:50:33.360 --> 1:50:37.200]  for us and do your Christmas shopping. You've got until Friday to have guaranteed delivery
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:41.760]  anywhere in the United States, including Alaska or Hawaii. Really Monday, you can get anywhere
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:47.760]  in Konus unless you're on some weird mountaintop and like Idaho. 99% you can get the order in by
[1:50:47.760 --> 1:50:54.640]  Monday infowarstore.com. Or we've got living defense plus that flushes out all the bad visitors and
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:50:58.160]  the rest of it. That's so amazing. Cross the guard really great for your immune system back in
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:03.360]  stock. And of course, Alpha Power sold out for a year because there's been a COVID lockdown on
[1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:06.320]  some of the patent ingredients that just made available a few months ago. And I said, hell,
[1:51:06.320 --> 1:51:12.080]  yes, I want 10,000 bottles of that. So that funds our operation infowarstore.com and get a t-shirt.
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:17.280]  M4's t-shirt. Who knows? I mean, CIA director says he wants to be in prison and they got
[1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:21.360]  them openly following me. And when I leave her today, they're going to follow me home and shoot
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.280]  video for if you want to see that. I mean, so you know, it's kind of in the end game here right now.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.360]  Most people who run around like chicks with their heads cut off. I look forward to whatever
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:34.640]  happens as I've done my job. I've run the course so far and I'm not backing down. Good right back.
[1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:44.160]  The U.S. Postal Service tells info wars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th,
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:47.760]  that we're able to ship it out by that day, you will get it anywhere in the United States
[1:51:47.760 --> 1:51:52.320]  before Christmas. But listen, don't wait. Do your shopping at infowarstore.com,
[1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:57.600]  get great products and fund the info war. Now at the most critical time, not just at info wars
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:02.880]  history, but this country's history, you have invested in info wars. You prayed for us. You've
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:07.920]  spread the word. You've bought the products and you've gotten the benefits of the information warfare
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:13.440]  of the truth in the fight against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all our efforts
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:18.000]  and praying for a great awakening which started to happen and spreading the word about infowars.com,
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:25.840]  newswars.com, and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing products at infowarstore.com.
[1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:29.600]  They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly on some items,
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:34.320]  the biggest sales of the year on new pharmaceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com. So thanks for
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:40.560]  your support. Get those orders in and God bless. The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:46.080]  government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income,
[1:52:46.080 --> 1:52:50.080]  which of course, the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on
[1:52:50.080 --> 1:52:55.280]  your phone and finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[1:52:55.280 --> 1:53:01.600]  UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:06.800]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 10 to 30, it's here.
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:12.240]  And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:18.320]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil,
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:24.240]  and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:30.800]  are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that,
[1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:56.800]  we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:12.800]  From 1810 to 1930, maybe his great-grandchildren believed you could live to 103. 103 is forever
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:25.280]  when you're just a little kid. So Cyrus Jones lived forever, great digger. When you dig my grave,
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:37.200]  you make it shallow, so I can feel the rain. So I can feel the rain, great digger. All right,
[1:54:37.200 --> 1:54:41.120]  the Sandra Fairbanks is with us next segment. She is the point person for doing this launch.
[1:54:41.680 --> 1:54:46.160]  And he's such a hero. I admire him so much. And I really see where you or I could be
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:57.120]  in the near future in a solitary confinement gulag. And if Trump would just release the hounds,
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.560]  declassify the information, and go out to the deep state, we could do so much. But
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:06.960]  Trump has people under him that will not do what he says.
[1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:12.080]  Trump's told him to declassify stuff. Trump said to go out to people. And some of it's happening.
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:17.440]  We're seeing the Chai comms exposed. We're seeing Hunter exposed. We're seeing raids on
[1:55:17.440 --> 1:55:22.160]  server farms in Austin connected to fraud, solar winds. I mean, actually, Trump's trying
[1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:26.880]  as hard as he can. But there's some things he could do with a flick of his wrist,
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.680]  a signature. And that's Julian Assange's next segment. I'm not
[1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.480]  properly plugged living defense. So let me just do that right now.
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:43.280]  Now, living defense was a sleeper product recommended by Dr. Group that he thought was
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:48.320]  the most amazing detox of the guts ever. It's beyond a probiotic. It also goes after parasites.
[1:55:49.120 --> 1:55:54.480]  And so he got it in stock four or five years ago and barely sold out of what we ordered each year
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:59.280]  until people started using it. And then it became a bestseller with 100% reviews.
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.800]  Then we did living defense plus, which is even stronger and more in each capsule. This
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:09.040]  bottle is just full of these. You can do two or three people's detox with these takes about a week
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:14.000]  and a half for each person or you can take on a routine basis. But it's amazing. And I was thinking,
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.200]  man, I haven't done this since last like October and it really made me lose weight, made me healthy,
[1:56:19.200 --> 1:56:23.920]  made me feel great. Why have I done it? So I started doing it again five days ago. That's why
[1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:27.920]  I'm on this living defense cake. And let me just say without getting graphic, it's been quite
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:36.320]  interesting. So living defense, ladies and gentlemen, living defense is incredible. It uses
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:41.120]  organic herbs enzymes to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms from the body. You can read
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:48.640]  the reviews that are incredible at info wars store.com. But first, let's talk about it.
[1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:56.720]  Organic black walnut hole when it's green, that's the key. When it's green, a traditional herb for
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:02.960]  Native Americans. There's one American tree has shown promising scientific research involving the
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:11.600]  green, unripe fruits, whole organic olive leaf. Olive leaf was used by ancient Romans to support
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:16.560]  their soldiers health, but traveling through foreign lands, those two mean it naturally.
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:22.880]  Organic neem leaf, a powerful herb traditionally used. It's ayurvedic by the Indians for internal
[1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:29.280]  cleansing and aiding in healthy digestive tract. Organic ginger root, a widely popular Asian herb
[1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:34.480]  and used traditionally for soothing the gut. It's also an anti-inflammatory like turmeric.
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:41.040]  Organic classia bark for pronounced that right is a tree native to South America that has been
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:51.760]  shown to contain potent systems. This polyphenol activates great fruit seed extract. Seed extract
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:58.080]  shows many very promising results in clinical studies and is also a super potent antioxidant
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:03.600]  doubling as a free radical scavenger that picks up toxins and carries it out of you.
[1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:08.160]  Organic black walnut leaf and stem has been traditionally used to clean out the gut and
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:14.000]  grape seed extract also a very high level antioxidant potential as well as many other
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:18.880]  useful properties. This is the thing to give in the stocking or as a gift to your husband,
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:23.120]  your wife, your neighbor, your boss and tell them it is a great detox probiotic next level.

[2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:21.120]  president trump could no longer be the president he may still be but becomes more and more long
[2:00:21.120 --> 2:00:28.640]  shot every day hoping that in the 34 days he has left he does a list of things well what are those
[2:00:28.640 --> 2:00:33.440]  things well i'm sure you've got ideas i've got ideas but chrisandra fairbanks is an amazing
[2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:37.760]  investigative journalist written for many big publications broken hundreds of huge stories
[2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:43.360]  she writes for the vauntedgatewaypundit.com thegatewaypundit.com she's a washington dc
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:47.120]  correspondent for those great folks she's a writer political commentator who has been
[2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:54.960]  published in a range of outlets and we have her joining us now chrisandra you are one of uh
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:01:01.280]  massage's best confidants and point person and you've been for many years he's been
[2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:06.000]  abandoned by so many others who've been threatened or intimidated he is from reports we've seen
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:12.880]  on the verge of not having insanity uh years and years of solitary confinement it trump has a limited
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:18.560]  window to do the right thing i want to talk about assange or visits with him the latest info and i
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.200]  know you're beseeching trump and others to do the right thing and obviously this audience should
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:27.600]  contact the white house and and and and do this and then after we talk about assange what else do
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:32.560]  you think president trump should do in this narrowing uh window of certainty because we're
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:38.160]  certain he's president for 34 more days and has this kinglike power of the executive unitary
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:44.160]  executive but it'll be gone soon uh not for certain but uh could be uh so again chrisandra
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:51.840]  thank you so much for joining us um there's a lot happening this week so it's great to be here to
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:56.320]  talk about it well i gotta ask a lot of questions but where do you want to go first i mean how is
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:03.280]  assange doing explain what's happening tell us he's not doing great there is a covid outbreak on
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:09.280]  his cell block and he was in the embassy for so long that his lungs are really bad because it was
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:14.320]  recirculated air he wasn't getting outside he couldn't leave the building at all um he was in there
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:21.120]  for almost a decade so that really took a toll on his lungs especially and so he's a little bit
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:25.920]  worried about you know what's gonna happen if he catches it he's in belmarsh prison obviously he
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:34.080]  can't really get away from it um so that's a big concern um he's also you know he's not doing great
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:39.200]  he can't see his children he can't see his family the prison's basically on lockdown he was having
[2:02:39.200 --> 2:02:47.040]  issues um speaking to his lawyers even during the extradition trial um so it is definitely taking
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:53.920]  a toll on him and on tuesday the his legal team formally requested a pardon from president doll
[2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:59.600]  trump so that's right that's the big news i should have led with that's why you're a good journalist
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:05.520]  that i'm not uh the his legal team was officially asked for a pardon that's a big deal uh please
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:11.600]  continue yes they formally requested that which was the first step to really getting things going
[2:03:11.600 --> 2:03:18.160]  right now we really need people to tweet at donald trump call the white house do any contact anyone
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:25.680]  you can and let him know that his supporters especially do support a pardon for julian um let
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:29.440]  him know that this would be a popular move i think that he's been fed a lot of really bad
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:36.000]  information from a lot of really bad people that he's appointed um and they've really demonized julian
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.920]  quite a lot and it's really important that we make it clear that julian is not a cartoon villain
[2:03:41.920 --> 2:03:47.920]  he's a person and that we support him and we support real journalism you know we can't be
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:52.800]  trashing the fake news all the time and then imprisoning real journalists who are doing real
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:04:00.800]  work um because then all that we're left with is those those fake news you know democratic party
[2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:06.400]  propagandists that are manipulating all of every all of the information that you get
[2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:12.720]  well you remember it was like four years ago in three months he said okay fine okay
[2:04:12.720 --> 2:04:18.000]  listen wiki leaks for a fat guy in his mom's basement release her emails because they're illegal
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:23.360]  doesn't matter who has them and so asans did it so trump really has a responsibility to do this
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:30.800]  yeah absolutely and his own legal team has argued um that wiki leaks releases are legal i mean they
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:37.200]  were speaking about the dnc leaks which he's not charged with but it's the same concept in a filing
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:44.240]  oh um trump is being sued by some obama lawyers and they were arguing that he had conspired with
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:49.760]  roger stone and wiki leaks to release these emails which isn't true but the point that they made in
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:58.080]  it was true they argued that you know under section 230 as it currently stands um a platform or a
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:06.800]  website is not responsible for the legality of third party information that's posted so wiki leaks
[2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:12.480]  as long as they weren't involved in the theft have no responsibility to protect this information
[2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:17.680]  sure and of course daniel ellsberg the pentagon papers released the fact that the pentagon really
[2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:20.880]  knew they couldn't win the war whether they were doing it but they didn't want the public to know
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.120]  that that was legal because he was exposing basically corruption and a crime of lying to congress
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:32.800]  and so again journalists as long as they don't steal the material have a right and a duty to
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:38.400]  then report on crimes they know and many whistleblowers like william benning of the nsa go to congress
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:42.480]  and then they get poisoned and almost die so the smartest thing is to go to the press we saw under
[2:05:42.480 --> 2:05:47.920]  obama that wore on the press unprecedented rest of journalists we need to see trump reverse that
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:55.120]  absolutely and you know julian has been his whole entire career has been dedicated to fighting
[2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:02.560]  the same exact people that have made donald trump's term um you know very difficult they're the people
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:07.440]  who have been blocking all these things all the policies that he wanted to implement they're the
[2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:15.280]  people who instigated this russia gate hoax they're they're the people who have you know possibly
[2:06:15.280 --> 2:06:23.760]  stolen this election the same deep state like horrible people that have been you know messing
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:30.160]  with trump at every turn are the same people that wanted julian in jail and that are trying to make
[2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:37.280]  this happen if trump really wants to stick it to these people before he goes if he goes um the best
[2:06:37.280 --> 2:06:43.360]  way to do that would be you know let let julian be free and set him loose on him again that's right
[2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:47.520]  we've heard news that that it's imminent or are those just rumors because i know you become
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:52.880]  over the years one of uh the main point people for talking to a sign what's the real skinny on that
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:59.520]  um well i haven't been able to speak to sange personally because of the fact that he's in prison
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:04.560]  and things are really tight right now but i you're talking about recently i know you visited him in
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:11.680]  in at the equator in mc correct yeah absolutely i visited him multiple times yeah but um in recent
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:16.800]  you know currently i haven't been able to see him but i have spoke to his legal team and people
[2:07:16.800 --> 2:07:21.600]  involved with wikileaks they have said they have not heard anything from the white house about any
[2:07:21.600 --> 2:07:27.200]  kind of pardon um they you know that tweet that went out that said that he would be pardoned it was
[2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:33.840]  later retracted um that was news to them they were all as shocked as i was when i saw it so
[2:07:33.840 --> 2:07:41.520]  we haven't heard anything um at all about which way trump is leaning on this well i talked to randy
[2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:46.400]  critico who was months and months ago the last time he was in a court trial he saw him in england
[2:07:46.400 --> 2:07:54.560]  he said a sange looked like living hell inside a plastic cage yeah even the last time that i mean
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:08:02.240]  the last time that i saw julian was gosh over two years ago now i guess he's been in there
[2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:10.560]  so long but even the six months between my two visits he was losing weight and he was he did
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:16.560]  not look well even before his arrest and then i saw the pictures of him after and i was like my gosh
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:25.920]  he's he's deteriorating and it's it's really sad because he it's almost aging him i mean oh it is
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:32.560]  well obama and hillary and hayden and all the deep state people uh this is on them i mean and if he
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:37.280]  dies in prison which i've seen a lot of doctors say he could uh that he that he's in really bad
[2:08:37.280 --> 2:08:43.040]  shape that most people would go insane after a year of solitary but but more than really 10 years of
[2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:49.040]  solitary confinement this is this is this is the next level yeah the un has said that it was torture
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:55.760]  on an unprecedented level i mean i'm not a huge fan of the un but no i agree but 10 years of solitary
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:01.360]  confinement three years of really intense i mean that is that's a prison sentence and he's done
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:07.520]  nothing wrong he's a journalist yeah i mean even if you think that releasing the war logs was wrong
[2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:11.440]  even if you think that it was the terrible thing to do that it hurt national security that the
[2:09:11.440 --> 2:09:17.120]  public didn't have a right to know this information even if you believe all those things how sadistic
[2:09:17.120 --> 2:09:22.080]  do you have to be to think that he deserves more of a punishment than he's he's already had he's
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:27.680]  lost 10 years of his life he has two small children and a fiance that he can't see um you have to be
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:33.760]  a monster to think that he deserves absolutely and all of it based on sex operatives that told lies

[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:49.680]  with you i'd love to see him russia if you're listening i hope you're able to find the 30 000
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:56.960]  emails that are missing i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:02.880]  okay so the media spun that but trump was saying whoever's got it there's another clip we can't
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:07.360]  seem to find i can't find either the crew can't that they buried it where he said i don't know who
[2:13:07.360 --> 2:13:12.800]  has it wiki leaks the russians a fat guy in a basement i don't care who did the hack give it
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:19.040]  to us it's illegal what she did i saw that clip on my treadmill right around the same time he made
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:23.200]  that statement too because they brought it back up to him a few days later where he said specifically
[2:13:23.200 --> 2:13:27.120]  to wiki leaks i don't know who has it wiki leaks you know whatever and then later wiki leaks said
[2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:33.040]  we have it and trump said over and over again yes release it and made the point doesn't matter who
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:40.880]  has it it matters what hillary's done so so he told him to do it and edward stoden said mr
[2:13:40.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  president if you grant only one act of clemency during your time in office please free jelena
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:52.400]  sange you alone can save his life does doesn't trump really have a responsibility to do that and
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.200]  there's stoden who i think did a great job as well he wants to get home but he's saying hey don't do
[2:13:57.200 --> 2:14:03.280]  it for me do it for a son so that's a that's a good thing he's doing isn't absolutely i that's
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:09.680]  snowden tweet just really showcased what a good man that guy is too i really respect him for doing
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:18.560]  that it was that was cool um yeah i think trump owes a lot of his voters to wiki leaks i mean
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:26.160]  personally i was like a left libertarian leaning weirdo i wasn't really a big trump supporter um
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:32.800]  and i a lot of why i came around was because of wiki leaks i mean i switched to trump during
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:39.600]  the primaries a lot faster than a lot of republicans but uh you know a lot of that was thanks to things
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:46.080]  that i read on wiki leaks and you know realizing how horrible corrupt the democratic party was and
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:52.480]  how awful hillary clinton was and trump was out there you know defending wiki leaks he said i love
[2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:58.640]  wiki leaks probably 50 times during speeches and it was a big part of what what made me come around
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:07.040]  on him and a lot of other people too i think that he you know um he does owe a bit of a bit of a
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:13.280]  thanks to julian because he really helped out his campaign um well imagine with all the crimes
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:18.560]  hillary's committed she's like oh we must have justice was a quote they had we must pay for
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:24.080]  what he's done talking about assange and that's like satan talking about you know what what a
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:29.440]  what a nice person has done and how satan's talking about justice this is disgusting she
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:35.520]  once said that she wanted to drone him i mean they said it was a joke that she was joking around but
[2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:41.680]  when she was secretary of state she was like why can't we just drone this guy i mean well obama
[2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:47.200]  just bragged that he'd drone and said so what have i killed a lot of us at people yeah julian is
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:54.560]  screwed if if biden takes office and trump doesn't do this part in um i i think julian will die in
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:01.360]  prison i think that you know something something has to be done like trump can save his life and
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:07.840]  as we saw yesterday from the release that project varitas put out um julian tried to redact those
[2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:15.120]  names he wiki leaks wasn't even the first one to publish the war logs um and that's been proven by
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:19.920]  you know the audio that came out yesterday so how are you going to punish the hundredth person who
[2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:25.520]  publishes this and not the first 99 i mean well that was actually the idea if you remember uh
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:32.240]  chris kwomo and cnn said at cnn we're allowed to watch this and listen to it but if you do you'll
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:38.800]  go to jail well that's very dangerous right it's incredible and that was a lie they just didn't
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:42.640]  want people to read it and it's completely different than how they've treated previous wiki leaks
[2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:49.200]  releases the washington post set up a volunteer database so that people could go through sarah
[2:16:49.200 --> 2:16:54.800]  palin's emails when wiki leaks had released emails that had some of sarah palin's um they asked for
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:17:00.240]  volunteers they created a whole twitter account um dedicated people sending their their finds
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:04.480]  from the emails they didn't do any of that with hillary clinton they told you not to read it don't
[2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:10.880]  look um and so even sarah palin has come out and said that julian should be pardoned though and she
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:16.320]  she got a bunch of her emails released by them back in the day well that's the thing i mean i was
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:20.080]  never a republican or democrat though it was pro gun and pro life so they call me a republican
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:24.640]  but i was against the wars i was against torture i was against bush and so the left kind of left
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:33.120]  me alone but the old liberals were anti-war at least cared about not having censorship as you said
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:38.560]  you were liberal and then you saw you know your hero wiki leaks now exposing democrats you thought
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:42.960]  god they're even worse than i thought and then now you see him persecuted and now you see journalists
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:48.400]  persecuted now you see the censorship and now you see the left bullying everybody and working with
[2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:54.400]  communist china to suppress millions in death camps the Uyghurs and i just like how did the liberals
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:00.320]  go from on average being well-meaning people like monsters it's like in their hatred of trump
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:07.520]  they just went crazy yeah it's it's crazy to watch because when i considered myself a leftist
[2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:14.480]  the reasons that i thought i was left was because i was anti-war very very anti-war and i was very
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:19.280]  very pro-free speech those were like the two most important things to me they still are
[2:18:19.280 --> 2:18:25.040]  and i was watching the left like get speakers shut down during the primaries and i watched how
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:31.360]  they didn't protest obama like the same people who protested bush with me in the war were suddenly
[2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:38.160]  silent as the drone ranger was killing american teenagers and stuff and i just the hypocrisy
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:43.200]  just kept unraveling for me and wiki leaks was kind of the final straw i was like these people
[2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:48.080]  are monsters oh that's one of the final straws for me as well was because i didn't know like i mean
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:53.040]  obama's so bad so is mccain i was kind of neutral in that election but then obama later going i'm
[2:18:53.040 --> 2:18:57.680]  really good at killing people and even the guys that really killed people don't act like that he's
[2:18:57.680 --> 2:19:04.240]  like giving an order he's really good at it to sandra yeah it's monstrous and all these people who
[2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:10.960]  were who were supposedly anti-war under bush just were completely silent on it and they're like oh
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:19.360]  it's obama he's great it's fine these are friendly nice hope and change bombs you know it was i it's
[2:19:19.360 --> 2:19:24.960]  horrible when we come back we've got a longer segment here and i really appreciate your time
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:29.360]  we'll let you go after this next segment so you got a lot to do i want to talk about big picture
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:33.040]  and just other things we should you're gonna be worried about and be doing and other people you
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.840]  think should be pardoned and what else you think trump should do but i also think we should pray for
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:42.640]  julian assange because god's real spiritual things are real and i think if we pray to god
[2:19:43.760 --> 2:19:48.400]  to touch trump's heart to touch other people's hearts and to release assange who's who's been
[2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:53.680]  absolutely tortured by any yards to anybody who think he's guilty which he's not and to see mainline
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:58.000]  journalist i mean look at how the media so-called journalists attacked him when he used to be their
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:05.520]  darling it's these are sick people yeah they're it's demented and we really really really need
[2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:11.360]  people to tweet at president donald trump nicely and just let him know that you would
[2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:17.840]  support a pardon we need him to know that his base would support this yeah roger stone deserved
[2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:24.080]  that the clemency judge or pile deserved a pardon if anybody deserves a pardon it's julian assange
[2:20:24.080 --> 2:20:30.640]  and uh i think trump's gonna do it i mean if he doesn't uh trump's gone from an a plus to a b minus
[2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:35.280]  for me uh because you can't really compare him to somebody like hillary or obama or joe biden
[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:44.320]  kassandra fairbanks is our guest at twitter at kassandra rules during our war for independence
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:49.200]  during some of the darkest days thomas jefferson the man credited with writing our declaration
[2:20:49.200 --> 2:20:53.040]  of independence of much of our constitution later said look this is not going to be an easy
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:58.720]  fight we're not going to be transported liberty on a bed of feathers no ladies and gentlemen
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:04.320]  we've actually had incredible successes with donald trump and bolstero and the liberty movement

[2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:51.120]  at info wars life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:51.120 --> 2:24:13.920]  coming up next segment breaking 19 house members submit letters seeking senate hearings on election
[2:24:13.920 --> 2:24:19.920]  fraud i love it how trump said last week quoting john paul jones found of the u.s navy i've only
[2:24:19.920 --> 2:24:25.920]  begun to fight and i agree we've got to keep fighting to expose the fraud and to use the
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:29.920]  resistance to let them know we're not backing down no matter what happens that's the whole point
[2:24:31.760 --> 2:24:35.520]  we get stronger they get weaker we start submitting they get stronger we get weaker
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:38.720]  senator fairbanks is here she's investigative journals get we put it dot com
[2:24:40.160 --> 2:24:45.280]  she's one of the main points for assange's lawyers and assange we get word out during his 10 years of
[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:51.120]  torture and she wanted to get into this so the full video is obviously a project veritas we have a
[2:24:51.120 --> 2:24:56.240]  full video at info wars dot com but but here's some of the audio slash video of assange on the
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:00.960]  phone with the u.s embassy tell people why this is so important to sundry because usually
[2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:06.800]  whistleblower media gets a document they don't call the whoever it is the fbi or the just department
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:12.640]  or the state department say what would you like redacted do they know that this is important
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:19.520]  because for years we've had people like john mccain and even rick grannell going around telling
[2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:26.080]  people that julian got sources killed that he got people who are working with the u.s military killed
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:32.400]  but this is not true the pentagon testified during chelsea manning's trial that nobody got killed
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:39.280]  because of of the release and they they said that they always say that he was reckless that he
[2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:45.040]  endangered people that by mass releasing this they were you know not practicing journalism
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:52.400]  but what this tape shows and why it's so important is that first of all wiki leaks weren't the ones
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:58.640]  who released all the unredacted files originally it got leaked by a guardian reporter luke harding
[2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:05.920]  who has censored tons of fake news about trump and julian um maybe he accidentally published
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:11.680]  the password in his book and that's how it got all over twitter all over krypton pirate bay
[2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:16.080]  yeah but sure look at all the look at all the whistleblowers on trump who who who were not
[2:26:16.080 --> 2:26:23.360]  reporting on crimes they were putting out false info false leaks that's illegal right but what
[2:26:23.360 --> 2:26:29.200]  what julian julian wasn't necessarily trying to like work with the government in the way that the
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:34.960]  democratic party were handing you know debate questions to hillary clain he was letting them
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:39.920]  what give their opinion on what should be removed right and he was doing it to keep people safe
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:45.120]  because he knew that there they were people who were in very dangerous areas and he wanted to
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:49.600]  make sure that their names were redacted so they wouldn't be killed well let me just kill that debate
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:57.120]  right now there were 22 plus million names of us government agents bureaucrats military workers
[2:26:57.760 --> 2:27:02.480]  and their families and those were all basically given by obama to the officer personnel management
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:07.680]  hack to the chai comms as a wedding president and now they've used that to harass and fire and go after
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:12.720]  all these patriots in the government i know a lot of them so china never got punished for 24
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:17.840]  million or 22 million names so i don't want to hear this crap that assange hurt somebody right
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:22.640]  but you know that's still an argument that they like to make a lot and this this audio puts an
[2:27:22.640 --> 2:27:27.360]  end to that debate like they can't even claim this anymore julian begged hillary clinton's
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:32.960]  state department to work with him so that he could make sure that he was you know responsibly
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:36.640]  handling the material and why didn't they do that because before he'd been really exposing
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:42.640]  republicans why did they suddenly not do that i don't know they just refused they they had no
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:48.240]  interest and he was begging them being like hey warn anybody who might be in this you know to get
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:57.760]  to safety um he's right let's go ahead let's go and voice some of that audio here it is yeah so the
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:11.120]  situation is that um we have intelligence that the um state department database archive of 250,000
[2:28:11.120 --> 2:28:22.080]  um diplomatic cables including um the classified cables is um being um spread around um and is
[2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:31.440]  a to the degree that um we believe that within the next few days it will become public um and
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:40.800]  we're not sure but the timing could be um imminently or um within the next few days to a
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:53.920]  week and uh there may be some possibility to stop and it goes on from there so what you're saying
[2:28:53.920 --> 2:29:00.240]  is standard is that is that this was already gonna come out he was doing them a favor yeah
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:06.560]  he was trying to help he didn't want americans to get killed you know he he wanted the information
[2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:12.000]  to be help be public because it was important but he wasn't trying to get anyone hurt why why is it
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:16.960]  just greenwald and you and others a few others rallying around him why isn't every journalist
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:21.440]  rallying around julia sange don't they get there next i mean if we saw obama wage war on
[2:29:21.440 --> 2:29:25.840]  journalists and whistleblowers if biden gets in what are you expecting to see sandra well this
[2:29:25.840 --> 2:29:30.800]  is the most interesting part i think the reason why a lot of journalists hate wiki leaks is because
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:37.120]  he doesn't just expose politicians and corrupt um deep state officials he also corrupt he also
[2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:42.640]  exposes corrupt journalists and there's a lot of them so you know you have all these access
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:29:49.120]  journalists to who kiss people's rings in order to get scoops and secrets and stories um and he
[2:29:49.120 --> 2:29:53.920]  he blows the lid off for their whole operation and he embarrasses them and they don't want him
[2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:59.840]  around they don't want somebody who's gonna you know expose corruption for real because if he
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:05.040]  exposes corruption for real then they're going to be implicated too and that's why these people are
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:10.720]  scared to support wiki leaks even though they could be next the president that is set by julie
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:17.520]  and sange being extradited here if he is if he has found guilty is going to be extremely dangerous
[2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:23.840]  for any investigative journalist i mean you have to think about presidents that are set when there's
[2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:31.040]  an administration that's not favorable to you and how it will be used and under a democrat a lot of
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:35.440]  right wing journalists are going to be screwed they're going to use this against us and and then
[2:30:35.440 --> 2:30:40.000]  under a right wing administration there's possibilities that it could be used against leftists
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:45.360]  they should be concerned but they're too worried about being embarrassed and what will happen or
[2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:50.160]  if they're exposed and so they won't come out and do the right thing they pretend that their
[2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:55.200]  fourth press freedom and they'll cry and be like trump was mean on twitter this is a violation of
[2:30:55.200 --> 2:31:00.880]  the free press oh yeah exactly when you disagree with them they call that suppression of the press
[2:31:00.880 --> 2:31:05.520]  but when you're putting journalists in solidary confinement that's okay it's ridiculous yeah i
[2:31:05.520 --> 2:31:14.640]  i loathe them hey my my true test of whether or not somebody is a good journalist and not corrupt
[2:31:14.640 --> 2:31:19.680]  or evil is if they're supporting julie and assange i totally agree and that's why they're
[2:31:19.680 --> 2:31:24.400]  keeping assange is they want a victory for tyranny and intimidate others and they know
[2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:28.720]  that trump does this the dam will break on other whistleblowers but you know i think from what i've
[2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:35.520]  seen it's caused more whistleblowing from inside and more leaks assange's suppression i don't think
[2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.640]  i think assange was better at putting stuff out than other groups but i think we've only
[2:31:38.640 --> 2:31:42.880]  seen exponential leaks since they've been holding assange like the vault seven stuff the rest of
[2:31:42.880 --> 2:31:49.200]  it i think there's a lot of other uh snowden type stuff about to break yeah imagine if if julie
[2:31:49.200 --> 2:31:53.840]  and had been free during the selection imagine the stuff that they might have potentially got
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:59.280]  from dominion or you know if they had been in charge of the hunter biden laptop imagine the
[2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:04.240]  stories that they could have potentially found in there no you're right that was a major game changer
[2:32:04.240 --> 2:32:09.760]  to keep him in prison for this election yeah i mean people would have been sending stuff to julie
[2:32:09.760 --> 2:32:15.760]  and most likely and i think that trump might have shot himself in his foot by by leaving him to rotten
[2:32:15.760 --> 2:32:20.640]  prisons instead of partying him sooner he should he should pardon him immediately but he should have
[2:32:20.640 --> 2:32:26.240]  done it during the election season well you talk about making a martyr if they let him die in prison
[2:32:26.240 --> 2:32:31.440]  for no reason for being a journalist it's just a very very dangerous president kassandra fair banks
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:37.360]  at twitter at kassandra rules and of course the gateway punnet dot com we got a minute left a
[2:32:37.360 --> 2:32:43.680]  parting statement or any other ideas um no just please do everything that you can to get the word
[2:32:43.680 --> 2:32:49.840]  out about julian please share the project veritas stuff share your thoughts share reasons that maybe
[2:32:49.840 --> 2:32:55.440]  other people haven't thought of and why he should be pardoned feel free to tweet at me i will retweet
[2:32:55.440 --> 2:33:04.480]  everything julian related um yeah please just try and keep momentum going and and make it known
[2:33:04.480 --> 2:33:08.960]  that trump's base would support this that's the most important thing we can do right now that
[2:33:08.960 --> 2:33:13.200]  now that the formal request isn't well you're right formal request by his lawyer for it to happen
[2:33:13.200 --> 2:33:18.160]  and again not to write myself into this but you and i are next the former cia director who got
[2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:23.520]  exposed and all this hayden has called for my arrest uh claiming i threatened uh biden did no
[2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:28.480]  such thing i said he's a walking corpse he's a reanimated zombie so old that isn't saying i'm
[2:33:28.480 --> 2:33:33.680]  going to kill him uh so this is really dangerous we know that's the place we're going to right now
[2:33:33.680 --> 2:33:37.120]  let's hope that the press wakes up and defends themselves for it's too late kassandra thank you

[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:34.480]  traveled though anybody's traveled overseas you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:39.760]  of that living defense it's true folks we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and
[2:36:39.760 --> 2:36:45.600]  living defense is over the top good globalists are taking control of the entire human genome
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:52.560]  they are forcing mutations this is forced evolution or de-evolution when you look at all
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:57.120]  the major research all the major programs are carrying out they are not to produce people
[2:36:57.120 --> 2:37:03.600]  that are smarter or folks that live longer or are more oral no external humanity into a commodity
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:08.720]  now we see some propaganda like communist china bragging hey we've done m r and a vaccines to
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:15.040]  make our soldiers supermen that's a way to make it sexy that hey we're experimenting on our troops
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:19.200]  we'll send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they
[2:37:19.200 --> 2:37:24.400]  tried a new experimental vaccine i'm talking to high level folks inside the federal government
[2:37:24.400 --> 2:37:28.160]  have the state of texas health department they say alex we know it hurts a lot of people
[2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:33.760]  is for a greater good but that's not even true and it violates the Geneva convention the nuremberg code
[2:37:33.760 --> 2:37:38.480]  federal state law this is violence being carried out against this by medical charity and we have
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:48.160]  a right to resist it with any means necessary you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:58.160]  so
[2:37:58.160 --> 2:38:18.160]  he never gives up he's alex jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of texas worldwide
[2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:26.160]  me
[2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:38.880]  okay i've got a clip here of a congressman and i know a lot of congressmen but i don't know all
[2:38:38.880 --> 2:38:43.680]  their names we're gonna find out the name it's from c span uh supreme court justice roberts was
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:49.840]  reportedly scared to take up the texas case according to staffer testimony so this is a
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:55.520]  staffer testifying in open hearings uh for a congressman right now i don't give a bleep about
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:02.000]  gore versus bush at the time we didn't have riots so that shows why they're doing this oh we've
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:05.840]  got to be politically correct we're not going to look at the facts wow and this is also breaking
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:11.440]  we'll have the name and the staffer info next segment for you and play it breaking 19 house
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:17.440]  members submit letters seeking senate hearings on election fraud representative mo brooks coming
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:24.240]  through republic and alabama announced via twitter today that he is joined by 18 house colleagues
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:29.200]  in submitting a letter to senate leaders hoping to hold hearings on election fraud before the
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:35.760]  january 6 electoral college vote confirmation 18 house colleagues join me in sending a letter
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:44.400]  to speaker polosi and various housing senate committee chairs seeking election fraud hearings
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:49.760]  ahead of the january 6 electoral college vote and rand paul and others are talking about trying
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:55.760]  to block stuff as well yes there's clear fraud just because the media gas lights and covers it up
[2:39:55.760 --> 2:40:03.520]  that's more the reason to expose it that's more the reason to go after it that's more of a reason
[2:40:03.520 --> 2:40:12.000]  uh to say that you are not going to submit to it so whatever happens to trump this is our mission
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:17.120]  is to resist and to speak out that's why they want to be arrested when i gave that speech at
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:22.720]  the jericho march to 10 000 people or so or more there in dc that was just one of many events that
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:27.120]  happened there was probably 200 000 people there total at all the events but it was a nice crowd
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  and i and i said i said listen we need to understand he is a globalist operative and
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:38.080]  that he will one way or another be removed meaning be a before i said i don't know what's gonna be
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:43.680]  in 38 days for this election and now 34 i even said that and i'm not like backing it up like i
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:48.640]  didn't mean violence don't get me don't arrest me ridiculous the story is the left calling for me
[2:40:48.640 --> 2:40:53.040]  to be arrested they're the ones running around saying kill trump and kill this person kill that
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:57.600]  person attack this person it's just so crazy that i'm so clear saying we don't know what's
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:01.760]  going to happen in 38 days whether he's going to be in there now or not but one way or another
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:06.240]  he's not going to be there because he's a communist chinese agent that's very clear to anybody
[2:41:06.240 --> 2:41:12.240]  i meant via impeachment uh or other criminal charge and let me tell you stuff's coming out of his
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:22.320]  son hunter biden that's open and shut very very quickly very very quickly so we'll see if i get
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:26.640]  the name of that staffer it's no big deal just to whoever put this out on twitter i know they're
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:32.160]  having hearings today i know it's interesting it's just i would like before i play the clip
[2:41:33.760 --> 2:41:38.160]  on air these things are fast moving here to tell you who the staffer is and who they're with
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:42.480]  so we'll see if we get that coming up and i think you'll probably want to find out
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:47.920]  in the comments below that's where i would get that all right we'll see what happens next hour
[2:41:47.920 --> 2:41:53.360]  with that i'll take over a little bit next hour now um some of the other big things that we have
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:42:02.880]  here that i have not gotten into is this report right here and that is poll majority of americans
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:08.720]  who have heard of the great reset oppose it well of course they do we need the majority
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:15.200]  to be informed so the real majority can say no but in the raspusin poll the heartland institute
[2:42:15.200 --> 2:42:20.400]  only 53 percent of likely voters oppose the great reset pray to 40 percent who support its goals
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:30.560]  so imagine being the 43 percent or 42 percent that actually think having big corporations stay
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:36.400]  open but small companies shut is a good idea they don't know what it means they don't know what it
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:42.080]  stands for they ask them would you like to use this to make the world more equitable and help
[2:42:42.080 --> 2:42:48.080]  poor people and end hunger and the average person says yes well you learn well the great
[2:42:48.080 --> 2:42:51.760]  reset's already starving millions to death and is written up by these big globalists that are
[2:42:51.760 --> 2:43:00.320]  tax exempt above the law would they then support that and the answer is no the answer is no so it's
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:07.760]  all how they phrase these questions it's all how they roll these out and as it begins to come out
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:13.280]  that mitch mcconnell is on the chinese payroll as begins to come out that they're intending to
[2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:18.160]  try to hand the senate victory to the democrats so mitch mcconnell can retire and sell off into the
[2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:24.720]  sunset america had better get pissed off and defend itself or it's going to lose everything it's got
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:32.800]  irish man sentenced to two months in prison for failing to wear a mask this has happened to my wife
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:39.840]  it's happened to my friends now when they're in parking lots particularly women men and women but
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:45.040]  will yell at women they don't usually do it to men i've noticed it in stores they'll harass
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:51.200]  women because women are seen as more passive and tend to submit all you gotta do is point out the
[2:43:51.200 --> 2:43:57.520]  studies it doesn't protect you that the mask are never coming off and that there's got to be some point
[2:43:57.520 --> 2:44:09.840]  and some level to which we finally start saying no because in the main this is about shutting down
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:15.680]  human society consolidating power and control and bringing in a world government so again i will
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:21.680]  ask you and i will ask you very very clearly and succinctly to realize the wheelhouse you're in
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:28.320]  and where this is going and that it doesn't get better it gets worse as these offshore corporations
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:40.640]  engage in massive social engineering at every level now yes as this stuff unfolds our credibility
[2:44:40.640 --> 2:44:44.560]  your credibility other people that have been exposing this your credibility is going to go up
[2:44:45.200 --> 2:44:50.000]  but we just can't sit there and live on those laurels because in this modern system
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:58.560]  they are moving to shut down all the avenues of communication so remember every day and everything
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:04.880]  you do that it is about the communication that you engage in now that is going to affect the
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:12.640]  change to the greatest level and that every day that you're not passionately engaged and involved
[2:45:12.640 --> 2:45:19.760]  that that is a day in the future that you won't have control of your life we are not in a normal
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:27.600]  situation anymore we are not in a normal position you think i want to come in here and host a morning

[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:54.320]  going on and we don't want that to happen right at the time we're going in to the maximum awakening
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:48:00.240]  period the time that is now we've been fighting against but we knew it was coming and and and
[2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:07.440]  and now our credibility is so ready and things are ripe to be overturned this is why the globalist
[2:48:07.440 --> 2:48:14.560]  must censor and shut us down because they have no future and no hope if we persevere and do not
[2:48:14.560 --> 2:48:20.320]  falter or waiver all right hour number four Matt Braggen coming up but I've got a few more clips

[2:50:00.640 --> 2:50:06.080]  and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:13.200]  and the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping
[2:50:13.200 --> 2:50:19.520]  abortion we must start valuing human life again we must start saying that we are not expendable
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:26.800]  that we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that we are all slaves we must stand
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:37.680]  up and declare our basic god-given human rights now you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:53.280]  you found it the front lines of the resistance i'm your host alex jones and boy we have some big
[2:50:53.280 --> 2:50:58.000]  developments for tucker carlsson front coming up next segment and even bigger developments
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:03.280]  pentagon appoints more trump loyalists including china experts so trumps finally making his move
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:08.400]  it may not be too late we'll see that this is one hell of a time to be alive but we've got this
[2:51:08.400 --> 2:51:14.240]  video it's up on info wars dot com supreme court justice roberts was reportedly scared to take up
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:22.720]  the texas case according to congressman matt patrick and what his office was told by supreme court
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:31.120]  justice roberts pretty amazing video here it is the talks of uh it was written by someone who's a
[2:51:31.120 --> 2:51:38.000]  current staffer for one of the supreme court justices and this i'll just describe the report
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:43.680]  to you that i read and you can make up at what you will um he said that the justices as they
[2:51:43.680 --> 2:51:48.880]  always do went into a closed room to discuss you know cases they're taking or your debate
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:53.040]  there's no phones no computers no nothing no one else is in the room except for the nine
[2:51:53.040 --> 2:51:58.640]  justices it's typically very civil um they usually don't hear any sound there's they just
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:05.120]  debate what they're doing but when the texas case was brought up he said he heard screaming
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:15.120]  through the walls as justice roberts and the other liberal justices were insisting that this
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:20.640]  case not be taken up um and the reason the the words that were heard through the wall
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:30.720]  when justice thomas and justice alito were citing bush versus gore from john roberts were i don't
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:38.240]  give up about that case i don't want to hear about it at that time we didn't have riots
[2:52:38.240 --> 2:52:50.400]  so what he was saying was that he was afraid of what would happen if they did the right thing
[2:52:51.760 --> 2:53:00.160]  and i'm sorry but that is moral cowardice and and we in the s rec i'm an s rec member
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:08.640]  or we put those words in very specifically because the charge of the supreme court is to
[2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:18.240]  ultimately be our final arbitrator our final line of defense for right and wrong and they did not
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:25.360]  do their duty so i think we should leave these words in because i want to send a strong message
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:34.240]  to them thank you is there any other discussion on the amendment to the motion
[2:53:37.200 --> 2:53:42.640]  mr chairman i raise a point of order against further consideration and that's the texas
[2:53:42.640 --> 2:53:47.600]  legislature and what went on there and what their reports are from the supreme court absolutely
[2:53:47.600 --> 2:53:52.560]  when you know about these judges not just supreme court justices but others they're chosen because
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:54:01.120]  they're so autistic basically would be the best word to describe them they literally live in la la
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:07.840]  land these lawyers and they think cova's real they think everything's real they think msnvc is real
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:14.160]  they think cnn's real and they think groveling to it all gets them ahead i mean they see something
[2:54:14.160 --> 2:54:20.960]  on cnn they think god said it and so you see black lives matter all fired up and 10 plus billion
[2:54:20.960 --> 2:54:27.520]  dollars 10.6 billion dollars raised since may and they don't want to be called a racist that's why
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:34.480]  they say it makes no sense you know when they call me a racist well to the left that's scary to the
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:43.520]  left that's a big big deal to be called that and their whole world revolves around not being told
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:47.760]  that because and they're politically correct universe doesn't matter they give a hundred bucks
[2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:54.480]  it goes to george soros or you know china's got death camps saying america sucks and giving
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:59.200]  a hundred bucks of black lives matter that goes to democratic party that makes them feel good
[2:55:00.160 --> 2:55:05.360]  wearing a mask makes them feel good it's something being done for them they're protecting themselves
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:12.000]  and and so it's a cult of cowardice a cult of ignorance a cult of idiocy and they don't want
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:16.000]  to hear statistics they don't want to hear facts anyone no no they've occupied the country our
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:21.120]  forebears created and they're running it straight into the ground and that's why something this
[2:55:21.120 --> 2:55:26.800]  wealthy and powerful always ends up falling because a bunch of soft scum take it over we've got the
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:33.520]  tucker curleston piece as we enter the season of michael vincent hayden and the latest in the zeitgeist
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:45.840]  we are the info war the post industrial world that's what george herbert walker bush signed on to it the
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:55.600]  Rio de Janeiro agenda 21 conference back in 1992 now they've launched agenda 2030 which is a post
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:56:00.080]  industrial world plow schwa with the debos group trudeau the prime minister of china they're all
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:08.240]  on record saying the great reset is agenda 2030 well you might want to find out what agenda 2030 is
[2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:14.240]  it is the destruction of society as we know it it is making the population war by designs we can
[2:56:14.240 --> 2:56:21.200]  be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family they're destroying civilization
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:28.720]  rebuild it in their dystopic image we are fighting this at info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[2:56:28.720 --> 2:56:34.240]  we are fighting for a pro-human future and we need you to get the facts to research and share
[2:56:34.240 --> 2:56:39.440]  with others and join the fight god bless you visit us spread the word at info wars dot com
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:57:02.880]  but i go up power to send humanity and overthrow the globalist program
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:12.720]  and stop the post-human era this is the info war we now take you live to the central texas
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:21.280]  command center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to alex jones i've got some
[2:57:21.280 --> 2:57:25.120]  really giant news but i'm gonna hit in a moment because trump really is showing all the signs
[2:57:25.120 --> 2:57:29.680]  he's doing after the deep state and has turned his afterburners on but that's kind of a day
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:35.440]  late a dollar short i think i think matt bracken was right when i saw him last week say that
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.160]  those thinking we're going into peaches and cream and a bed of roses are smoking some of the wacky
[2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:49.520]  tobacco there are some chances and there are some avenues of hope in our moment of discontent
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:55.840]  but we've got to be honest about how much s h dash t we're in we want to turn that around but let's
[2:57:55.840 --> 2:58:01.040]  talk about michael vincent hayden one of the most corrupt ci directors ever so horrible they also
[2:58:01.040 --> 2:58:06.960]  had him before that run the nsa uh lying to congress saying there's no fourth amendment
[2:58:07.600 --> 2:58:13.680]  caught spying on political adversaries caught spying on the senate he's a bad bad man and the
[2:58:13.680 --> 2:58:18.960]  word is people that work with him is that i was dead on when i uh made uh some points about what
[2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:23.040]  he looks like uh you know how much saying he's a child molester i'm just saying he looks like one
[2:58:23.040 --> 2:58:29.600]  uh so we've got all that information he came out and said i should be arrested two days ago
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:34.960]  he said yeah jones threatened uh biden he should be arrested no no i said biden is a
[2:58:34.960 --> 2:58:40.640]  reanimated corpse an edifice of a collapsing system and whether he gets into office in 38 days or
[2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:46.160]  whether he's removed by some other means he'll be gone either way same thing polosi said six
[2:58:46.160 --> 2:58:51.360]  months ago about trump the last thing i want is violence against biden turning him into a damn
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:57.040]  martyr and i'm not a gangster tough guy that's into talking about killing people okay i'm not like
[2:58:57.040 --> 2:59:02.560]  hayden and obama that talk about their drone strikes all day but here's the article on info
[2:59:02.560 --> 2:59:09.920]  wars dot com by don salazar former ci director hayden slams tucker for going after dr jill biden
[2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:15.760]  but she's not a doctor it's a fake doctorate he covered it and then hayden goes out and says oh
[2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:21.760]  tucker in college tried to join the cia but was rejected according to wikipedia well number one
[2:59:21.760 --> 2:59:27.040]  who cares what wikipedia says most of its lies plus if you know anything about tucker carlson
[2:59:27.040 --> 2:59:32.400]  you know that his dad ran voice of america and a bunch of other things and so it's kind of like
[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:36.640]  your dad want you to join the football team but you really don't want to tucker carlson's the number
[2:59:36.640 --> 2:59:42.960]  one tv host in u.s modern history tucker carlson's a patriot and well-spoken and stood up for america
[2:59:42.960 --> 2:59:49.920]  so oh he didn't get into the club like hayden did what a what a sick little monster hayden is a
[2:59:49.920 --> 2:59:55.920]  rest journalist keep a son's in jail arrest alex jones and then don't respond to jill biden's
[2:59:55.920 --> 3:00:03.520]  fake doctorate no just say oh you tried to get in the cia and didn't even if that's true hayden
[3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:07.440]  so let's go of course by the time he tried to join the cia it's true it was global's run so we
[3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:11.920]  know why they didn't let him in not like his dad's days of working in the government so
[3:00:11.920 --> 3:00:20.480]  let's go ahead and go to a little clip here of tucker carlson talking about us you don't just
[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:27.520]  walk toward the light you run so contrary to what you may have read dr jill biden is not a healer
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:31.360]  she's not allowed to write prescriptions she wouldn't know what to do if you're appendix
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:35.600]  dr jill has an education degree from some school in delaware and you're supposed to find that
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:41.360]  highly impressive she could be a surgeon general now many have laughed at the apparent absurdity
[3:00:41.360 --> 3:00:46.880]  of this but we took it seriously because that's our job we actually read her dissertation this
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:51.760]  week the very document that made her quote a doctor and what did we discover when we did that
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:56.560]  we're going to give it to you in a diagnosis dr jill needs reading glasses either that or she's
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:02.000]  borderline illiterate there are typos everywhere including in the first graph of the introduction
[3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:07.520]  dr jill can't write and she can't really think clearly either parts of the dissertation seem
[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:13.200]  to be written in a foreign language using english words they're essentially pure nonsense like pig
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:19.440]  latin or dogs barking the whole thing is just incredibly embarrassing and not simply to poor
[3:01:19.440 --> 3:01:23.920]  illiterate jill biden but to the college they considered this crap scholarship embarrassing
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:29.680]  in fact to our entire system of higher education to the nation itself jill biden's doctoral
[3:01:29.680 --> 3:01:36.320]  dissertation is our national shame are we overstating this will you decide on the very
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:41.600]  first page of dr biden's opus she describes an average class of students at a community college
[3:01:41.600 --> 3:01:46.640]  called delaware of tech of course she counts the students by their skin color she's a biden after
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:52.560]  all but pay close attention to the math quote three quarters of the class will be Caucasian
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:58.480]  one quarter of the class will be african-american one seat will hold a latino and the remaining
[3:01:58.480 --> 3:02:04.080]  seats will be filled with students of asian descent or non-resident aliens in other words
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:10.080]  somehow dr biden accounted for all five quarters of the class which actually isn't easy you've
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:17.200]  got to pay very close attention to do something well that's not true because on south park you've
[3:02:17.200 --> 3:02:25.360]  got part bear part man part pig you know one half bear one half human one half pig i mean there's
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:31.760]  three three halves rather there's five it's five quarters i mean this is fuzzy math ladies and
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:36.720]  gentlemen and so imagine the response of hayden we talked about yesterday we showed you the day
[3:02:36.720 --> 3:02:42.240]  before on his twitter saying oh my gosh trump supreme court says that churches should be open
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:46.400]  and that and that you can't have laws against it and then the very next day he's at a pittsburgh

[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:32.800]  this is a criminal enterprise of incredible proportions the problem is the same justice
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:40.480]  department is overseeing this but bill bar's gone so this did bar resign because trump went ahead
[3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:46.080]  and got people to move forward with the hunter biden investigation to make it public i'm just not
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:50.160]  going to hold my breath like i've always been doing for two weeks more two weeks more the last

[3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:09.440]  officer is just this magic person they may do it for a living they may do a lot of research but
[3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:13.840]  there's not like some secret crystal ball you get invited into and then the answer is all of it
[3:05:15.040 --> 3:05:20.800]  no most information is open source or what you personally observe in the real world
[3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:29.920]  and what i've seen is a bunch of sycophantic end of a republic end of an empire swamp behavior

[3:08:58.480 --> 3:09:08.640]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[3:09:12.160 --> 3:09:18.000]  well it's um it's pretty hard to get into the christmas spirit this year exactly i don't know
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:22.560]  what it is maybe it's watching you the country that you grew up in the country that you love
[3:09:22.560 --> 3:09:31.040]  the country of your forefathers our free republic watching it crumble and crash and burn before our
[3:09:31.040 --> 3:09:40.640]  eyes apparently i think that um the supreme court put a put the final nail in the coffin last week
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:48.560]  when when the cowards punted and washed their hands like punches pilot you know they were
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:56.320]  evidently too afraid of the riots so the the communists get the the uh not the hecklers veto
[3:09:56.320 --> 3:10:04.480]  but the terrorist veto you know let us have it even though it was stolen or will burn your cities
[3:10:04.480 --> 3:10:12.000]  and the supreme court said all right then we'll let you have it but that's not going to be the end
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:20.080]  of the story because at least we know what happened more than half of americans by the polls you know
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:25.600]  say that there was fraud this is republicans and democrats obviously the vast majority of
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:32.240]  republicans but when they say a third of the democrats admit that there was fraud you gotta
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:38.720]  assume that a lot of these democrats they're good comrades so they're going to lie for the team
[3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:46.960]  you know the ends justify the means by any means necessary so just like like good little commissars
[3:10:46.960 --> 3:10:52.160]  they're going to say no comrade there was no fraud but in their heart they know it's true
[3:10:52.160 --> 3:10:59.600]  so i would have to say that most sentient thinking americans they understand what what happened i mean
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:05.360]  you even have it on video you watch them pulling the trunkloads of fake ballots out from under the
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:14.720]  table and the media just stays with there was no fraud no fraud at all it's not that these cases
[3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:19.840]  have been heard in court and have been shot down the cases haven't been heard at all
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:26.240]  that these courts at the state and the supreme court level have refused to hear the cases
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:33.040]  they're like the uh you know the seno hear no speak no evil monkeys they think that they can
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:40.240]  just slide through this and we'll just accept biden as president i think it was larry elder i heard
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:47.120]  maybe with somebody else said said um trump had you know the the biggest coattails in history
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:54.080]  pulling up uh you know the congress and saving the senate and improving our our stand in state
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:12:01.840]  legislatures yet he had no coat how does that happen we're supposed to believe that that um
[3:12:01.840 --> 3:12:08.080]  joe biden from the basement doing these rallies in front of a couple of cars from a car dealership
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:13.680]  you know like all jeeps on one or you know all other cars on another they literally bring vehicles
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:20.400]  in from a car lot and hire democrats to stand around and we're supposed to believe that he'd
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:27.760]  not only beat um hillary clinton's number but barack obama's number of votes in both elections
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:37.760]  including 2012 nobody with three brain cells believes this at all now local house a little bit
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:45.040]  of local uh info wars i was really you know it hurts to hear that david night is gone um
[3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:51.840]  i've been on the show many times and consider him a you know i don't know him well but i mean
[3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:56.800]  based on before and after and during the commercials he's a real gentleman he's a great guy
[3:12:56.800 --> 3:13:04.080]  right and for any of you skeptics that think that info wars is some kind of a you know a cash cow
[3:13:04.880 --> 3:13:10.640]  that it that it's just raking in the dough it's not this is a shoestring operation
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:18.240]  you know this is this is a month by month deal and with biden in the white house the justice
[3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:24.720]  department is going to be turning the dogs loose on all of their enemies this will include the
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:31.840]  trump family and it's going to include the info wars family you know we have seen nothing to compare
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:39.360]  to the lawfare that is going to be set loose on the enemies of the deep state um if and when
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:47.040]  biden is inaugurated now there is there is going to be no holds barred in their venom going after
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:54.880]  their enemies especially their enemies in in the media and and info wars being a big part of that
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:14:02.400]  people like general hayden nsa cia these they're not bluffing when they say that they want to see
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:10.720]  alex jones arrested they'd like to see alex jones in a cell like julian assange me too and a lot
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:17.520]  of other people myself included you know would would wind up there if they can get their way that's
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:26.000]  how serious this is so if anything good has come out of this it's been lifting the blinders off of
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:33.440]  most nor many normie americans that always just assumed hey america is special america will never
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:39.680]  go down we'll always be free freedom is our birthright but now we can see that this is really
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:46.640]  just an example of of an extended normalcy bias now we see that the deep state really has been
[3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:54.240]  been running the show you know in in mexico and and in south america they have that saying
[3:14:54.240 --> 3:15:01.440]  plata oplomo silver or lead and they'll come into the mayor's office when he's elected and put the
[3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:06.880]  trunk you know the suitcase on the table with a gun in the money and give him the choice well now
[3:15:06.880 --> 3:15:14.320]  we know in america it's not really all that different but it's a it's more subtle what trump
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:20.080]  did was come into town and talk about draining the swamp he was talking about turning off this
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:29.840]  revolving door of graft and as a result every gun in town was aimed at him from day one in the media
[3:15:29.840 --> 3:15:37.520]  in academia in obviously in politics he had from from the start he had every democrat
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:45.520]  and half of the republicans against him half of the republicans just want to be the loyal opposition
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:51.760]  the b side of the of the 45 record for you guys that get that reference yeah they're just happy
[3:15:51.760 --> 3:15:57.600]  to be you remember the harlem globetrotters they're happy to play the washington generals
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:16:03.360]  they can collect all the graft take all the bribes from the you know the the companies
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:10.080]  that they buy contracts from or they they vote for the bills that pay the billions for the missiles
[3:16:10.720 --> 3:16:17.600]  and then the democrats do the same kind of graft on their side with with uh you know welfare
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:23.360]  and it's and paying for the you know urban projects that really just go into a few pockets
[3:16:23.360 --> 3:16:30.800]  it's just a game mitch mcconnell's part of this happy crew i mean he's a deep state swamp rat
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:37.120]  among the best of them i mean he's he's married to a family married into a family that is
[3:16:37.760 --> 3:16:44.080]  in the billion dollar level chinese shipping business you can't tell me he's not a deep
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:50.800]  stator he's also taken money from dominion of voting systems and other companies implicated
[3:16:50.800 --> 3:16:57.680]  in this fraud he doesn't want an exploration of this he wants it all buried he wants it
[3:16:57.680 --> 3:17:05.760]  swept under the rug for good half of the republicans in congress are whispering a sigh of relief
[3:17:05.760 --> 3:17:11.760]  that trump is going to be out of town and their old colleague joe biden will be back in charge
[3:17:11.760 --> 3:17:17.440]  will be in charge and they think that it's just going to go back to business as usual but i'm
[3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:25.280]  here to tell you business as usual is dead it's gone it's over it's never going back to the
[3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:32.400]  way that it was now just in the last 24 hours there's been some news on the second amendment
[3:17:32.400 --> 3:17:36.960]  front that i'm going to start the next segment with if you have any guns you're going to want to
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:44.000]  know this the globalists and their minions want to play god chucky schumer hillary clinton barack
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:49.600]  obama you look at these sacks of garbage and you think why do they hate humanity so much why do
[3:17:49.600 --> 3:17:58.080]  they love death because they hate themselves they project their own disgust with their soul
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:03.520]  on to us and once you understand that basic psychological point every other answer is
[3:18:03.520 --> 3:18:08.880]  completely clear that's why they hate info wars we believe in humanity we think you're beautiful
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:15.040]  we think you're amazing info wars knows you're fallen but that you have god's potential that god

[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:49.600]  independence of much of our constitution later said look this is not going to be an easy fight
[3:18:49.600 --> 3:18:55.280]  we're not going to be transported liberty on a bed of feathers no ladies and gentlemen we've
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:19:00.640]  actually had incredible successes with donald trump and balsam arrow and the liberty movement
[3:19:00.640 --> 3:19:05.520]  worldwide we're gonna have major setbacks but there is a giant awakening happening that's
[3:19:05.520 --> 3:19:10.320]  where the globalists have gone ahead and launched their great reset global collapse worldwide social
[3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:15.440]  credit score tracking app microchip for its modulation takeover now because if they don't

[3:19:52.160 --> 3:19:56.480]  if you are deficient then you can actually die from it that's why you see somebody dying
[3:19:56.480 --> 3:20:01.840]  inside the nursing homes meanwhile all these top scientists and and researchers and former
[3:20:01.840 --> 3:20:07.280]  fizer head medical officers have come out and said that the covet 19 vaccine especially the mrna
[3:20:07.280 --> 3:20:11.200]  ones are basically bio weapons and are super deadly and now they're having to resuscitate
[3:20:11.200 --> 3:20:16.240]  people that die basically when they take it just like newborn babies they give vaccines
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:20.000]  they have to resuscitate them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die and that's
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:25.520]  on the record it does that geon moray's narcolepsy cancer all these other diseases but they tell you
[3:20:25.520 --> 3:20:29.440]  safe and effective no one's getting hurt it's a conspiracy theory and then all the fine princess
[3:20:29.440 --> 3:20:34.080]  can kill you absolutely deadly so they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something
[3:20:34.080 --> 3:20:40.560]  that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe they do it let's go to one in
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:44.240]  connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding hello can you hear me i sure can't sir thank you

[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:23.840]  long-term high quality energy powder there is so this this was designed on one of the top guys
[3:21:23.840 --> 3:21:26.880]  in the country he didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues but
[3:21:26.880 --> 3:21:30.560]  we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:35.040]  the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life
[3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:37.840]  better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck drivers we love you
[3:21:37.840 --> 3:21:53.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:21:53.760 --> 3:22:10.800]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:24.160]  yeah my my books are uh they're on amazon you can get them in on kindle or audible if you
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:28.400]  don't mind the fact that they'll probably be deleted at some point as you know seditious
[3:22:28.400 --> 3:22:34.880]  subversive anti-government dangerous literature if you get them in the print version and you
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:40.320]  get them from me i'll sign them and then you're not giving uh i think amazon's got enough money
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:46.560]  frankly honestly i think i really do you know that this uh this infowars channel
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:50.960]  we've come to take it for granted it's been around for a quarter of a century
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:57.360]  or in one form or another but um i don't think it's ever faced a challenge like what's coming
[3:22:57.360 --> 3:23:05.200]  over the horizon i mean uh it's it's uh it's hard to think about this but the same people that
[3:23:05.200 --> 3:23:10.640]  are happy that julian assange is dying in prison you know being murdered in slow motion and
[3:23:11.440 --> 3:23:18.800]  in great britain's most notorious high uh high security prison where they keep terrorists and
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:26.720]  mass murderers you know where you are essentially driven insane stage by stage through isolation
[3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:32.480]  through sensory deprivation i mean it's a it's a very cruel thing and i would
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:38.960]  certainly encourage uh president trump to to uh pardon this you know many people but starting
[3:23:38.960 --> 3:23:46.000]  with julian assange and i'm not i'm not sure at this point even if trump pardoned him will the brits
[3:23:46.720 --> 3:23:52.800]  figure out some way to hold him charge him with something else take get him back to holland or
[3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:57.760]  sweden on one of these other bogus charges so that the deep state because with a deep state is
[3:23:57.760 --> 3:24:05.280]  global folks we're not just talking about us versus uk jurisdictions and laws this octopus
[3:24:05.280 --> 3:24:11.440]  has tentacles everywhere and i don't think they want julian assange ever to see the light of day
[3:24:12.080 --> 3:24:19.120]  both for what he can say and as he's serving as a as a living example of what happens when
[3:24:19.120 --> 3:24:25.440]  you go against the deep state that that they're going to just ruin you and destroy you how many
[3:24:25.440 --> 3:24:33.280]  reporters are now essentially operating operating under old soviet rules you know you pretend to
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:38.880]  be a reporter but you know there's third rails out there there's things you just don't dare talk about
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:44.480]  michael hayden saying that he'd like to see alex joneson you know arrested and in jail
[3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:52.800]  that's just part of the same thing and we're coming into a very serious era now for you
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:59.600]  gun owners out out there you'll know right away if you've what an ar-15 is and because of the
[3:24:59.600 --> 3:25:07.200]  peculiarities of the way that us law has was was uh defining what are illegal and illegal weapons in
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:16.000]  the last half of a century it turned out that an ar-15 could be a pistol if it had a just a a brace
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:23.680]  instead of a stock on the back and a short barrel in front made it a very compact handy you know
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:32.400]  effective fire a weapon platform but the atf just in the last 24 hours has redefined what it
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:40.800]  what is allowable what and it looks like all of the millions and millions of ar-15 pistols
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:48.240]  are going to be made illegal not by passing a new law but just by a definition a bureaucratic
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:55.200]  definition and this is while trump is still the president of the united states so you can see that
[3:25:55.760 --> 3:26:03.040]  that um within the department of justice these agencies are already acting as if trump is
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:11.520]  is gone he's just a you know a very lame lame duck they're looking forward to uh biden harris
[3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:18.080]  beto orork and the gun grabbers are feeling their oats so if they're going to do this now
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:26.880]  before biden is even inaugurated just imagine what's coming next spring you know kamala harris
[3:26:26.880 --> 3:26:35.920]  has said that she is going to ban semi-automatic weapons within a hundred days by executive
[3:26:35.920 --> 3:26:44.160]  action even if even if there is no law passed by congress now the normies out here who are still
[3:26:44.160 --> 3:26:50.080]  clinging to the old rule of law notions of america are going to be thinking but matt
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:56.960]  they can't do that you can't outlaw guns by an executive action it would be unconstitutional
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:05.360]  i mean they just couldn't do it they have to pass the law who are you kidding the supreme court
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:14.240]  has given the green light to stealing an election they have put the stamp of approval on stealing
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:22.240]  an election in front of our faces you know what right now the the last firewall is supposedly
[3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:29.680]  this georgia election early january and we're thinking like normies if we just get out there and
[3:27:29.680 --> 3:27:36.880]  vote for law flur and perdu we can stave off this disaster because we'll still hold the senate
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:43.360]  folks do you think we're going to win that election in georgia if we couldn't if we couldn't
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:50.160]  stop the theft of the presidential election in front of our eyes did zuckerberg alone
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:56.640]  through a couple bogus foundations that they created pumped more than 400 million dollars
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:03.840]  into quote unquote turning out the vote in democrat areas in these swing states these
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:11.040]  involved putting what they called zucker boxes every few blocks throughout cities like philadelphia
[3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:19.120]  where these randomly who knows if they were mass produced printed imported from china but
[3:28:19.120 --> 3:28:25.920]  all of these ballots that wound up in these zucker boxes ended up being counted there were no
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:32.240]  rejections there was statistically you could put mickey mouse on a ballot that you xeroxed
[3:28:32.240 --> 3:28:37.920]  and the xerox might even smear because you're yanking out of the machine so fast it's going to be
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:45.920]  counted in the dominion vote switching machine it will be counted so now they're doing this in georgia
[3:28:45.920 --> 3:28:50.560]  and they're putting their record in places like milwaukee and philadelphia it's a shame
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:58.880]  they have buses driving around that are mobile polling stations paid for by zuckerberg they have
[3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:08.240]  these zuck these z boxes all over atlanta where you can stuff in your your made-up mail-in ballots
[3:29:08.240 --> 3:29:14.000]  anybody who thinks we're going to win that with a you know appealing to the republicans get out
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:20.960]  the vote for these two stalwart senators that won't even defend trump that give him not even a lip
[3:29:20.960 --> 3:29:26.960]  service and they think that that republicans are going to turn out for them part of me says
[3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:32.800]  if we're going to have this fight let's just get on with it and not go through this sham
[3:29:32.800 --> 3:29:40.960]  of mitch mcconnell allegedly leading the republicans half of whom hate trump as much as the democrats
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:47.520]  just want to get back to playing the washington generals the happy losers you know to the democrat
[3:29:47.520 --> 3:29:55.680]  globetrotters so if this is going to happen why not just let it go all the way and i'm not necessarily
[3:29:55.680 --> 3:30:02.800]  saying that's what i think republicans in georgia should do but that sentiment i think is fairly
[3:30:02.800 --> 3:30:08.960]  prevalent in georgia and that means there's a significant percentage of the republicans that
[3:30:08.960 --> 3:30:15.440]  voted for trump and saw the election stolen anyway they're going to say the hell with it
[3:30:15.440 --> 3:30:23.280]  you know the old ballot box it's over and we know what comes after the ballot box it's this box
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:31.440]  and it's going to happen because already before trump is even gone they're going after the the
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:39.040]  ar pistols you'll be a felon if you keep what you legally own today you're going next year you'll be
[3:30:39.040 --> 3:30:44.960]  a felon then they're going to outlaw semi-autos rifles pistols shotguns they're going to outlaw
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:52.240]  them and you'll be a felon if you own it so you'll have the choice do i destroy it lose it in a
[3:30:52.240 --> 3:30:59.360]  canoe accident for real do i turn it into the government do i wait for some program where
[3:30:59.360 --> 3:31:05.920]  they'll buy it back even though i didn't buy it from them or am i just going to keep it and say
[3:31:05.920 --> 3:31:11.520]  the hell with you if you want it you're going to have to come and get it and i don't know how many
[3:31:12.080 --> 3:31:17.200]  federal agents there are but i think there's a hell of a lot more pissed off gun owners
[3:31:17.200 --> 3:31:25.680]  out there than there are federal agents willing to go house to house taking away our guns any gun
[3:31:25.680 --> 3:31:32.560]  that's legal right now today in 2020 as far as i'm concerned as a free american it's going to be
[3:31:32.560 --> 3:31:38.480]  mined forever and if they want it they're going to have to come and get them the hard way the u.s
[3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:44.400]  postal service tells info wars that as long as you get your order in by december 18th that we're

[3:34:49.600 --> 3:34:55.600]  second term ontarian 20th the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic
[3:34:55.600 --> 3:35:00.080]  they are going to explode gas prices they're going to shut down our cold power plants they're going
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:04.800]  to cut off the energy source to us so it's impossible for factories to move back here
[3:35:04.800 --> 3:35:09.920]  this is economic domination this is economic war we're being consolidated we're being taken over
[3:35:09.920 --> 3:35:15.360]  the democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states they're consolidating power and control
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:20.400]  to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership
[3:35:20.400 --> 3:35:25.200]  of all the infrastructure and property this is a monopolistic takeover that's what the great
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:30.400]  reset is clout swab and these other criminals admit it that's what social distancing is

[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:28.160]  is my second amendment novel and it starts with a false flag massacre at a stadium that was used
[3:36:28.160 --> 3:36:36.160]  as a pretext to ban semi-automatic weapons in america and one of the one of the uh tools that the
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:44.400]  the government used to try to enforce this was the fear of being snitched you know you might
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:52.400]  not you might think i'm just going to hang on to my now soon to be illegal ar-15 or ak-47 semi-auto
[3:36:52.400 --> 3:37:00.320]  but uh what about my neighbor that knows that i own it you know didn't he vote for biden wouldn't

[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:55.120]  turning into orwellian territory you can they can lie for four years about trump being a russian
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:02.480]  agent no problem no fact check but if you even talk about election fraud now you get the automatic
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:10.480]  warnings and you also get your your spread throttled down uh the other day mark dice had a he put out a
[3:38:10.480 --> 3:38:17.760]  tweet that he said he he just reposted a link to the trump greatest speech you know the one that he
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:22.960]  had to put out on his own because the media wouldn't cover it i mean we have a president of the united
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:30.000]  states that can't give an oval office address it won't be covered so mark dice has a million followers
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:39.760]  he put out a link to it and it had 19 interactions out of a million so they just turned his volume off
[3:38:40.560 --> 3:38:44.800]  that's what they do they just turn the volume off but when they want to turn the volume up
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:51.600]  it's going to be ever present and you're going to hear messages like this we already know you have
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:58.960]  an ar so don't don't bs us we know even though there's not an official registry we know because
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:09.120]  we we keep track of who buys ar 15 magazines ammunition accessories we know the the same
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:16.320]  data mining ai programs that let big tech know what we're about to buy before we even think about it
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:24.320]  we'll let the government know with a 99.9 certainty who owns an ar 15 or or any other
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:30.640]  semi-auto weapon now i don't know where they're going to start high profile cases to make examples
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:37.120]  of people but this is seriously coming this is going to be a big gut check for people there's
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:43.280]  going to be unbelievable pressure especially when there are examples made of people so how's this
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:50.640]  going to play out i don't know i wrote one i wrote one version in enemies foreign and domestic
[3:39:50.640 --> 3:39:58.240]  where by using a big massacre like a las vegas level massacre they can get congress to pass the
[3:39:58.240 --> 3:40:04.800]  law like in a matter of weeks in this case we're going to have an invalid bogus president that
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:11.760]  half of the country thinks stole the election you know venezuela style so we're not likely to
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:19.200]  respect any laws or any executive orders coming out of this of this administration at all you know
[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:26.560]  so i i can only say hunker down and be prepared for heavy weather because besides going for the guns
[3:40:27.120 --> 3:40:35.040]  they're also going to come out with a 100 day at least you know it'll never end a mask edict
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:42.480]  biden's already talked about that and what is the purpose of a mask a mask edict it's a compliance
[3:40:42.480 --> 3:40:50.640]  measure it's a are you an obedient comrade do you dare to walk around outside without a mask
[3:40:50.640 --> 3:40:59.760]  you are announcing that you're a scoff law that you are refusing to comply and that's also a setup
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:07.120]  for the for the forced vaccinations that you know are coming it's coming folks this is really
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:13.360]  getting into mark of the beast territory where you won't be able to buy and sell without that
[3:41:13.360 --> 3:41:22.160]  vaccine that rna vaccine that nobody can promise won't cause birth defects or other consequences
[3:41:22.160 --> 3:41:29.120]  that might not show up for years down the road so we are getting into the serious push comes to show
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:36.000]  phase of this and i would just like to remind anybody in law enforcement federal or local and
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:41.280]  i've written about this extensively i have i have published essays they're in this book the
[3:41:41.280 --> 3:41:46.800]  bracken collection they're floating around on the internet a message to law enforcement
[3:41:47.840 --> 3:41:56.560]  if you cooperate with any form of gun confiscation going after guns that this invalid bogus fraudulent
[3:41:56.560 --> 3:42:03.680]  administration tries to propose if you cooperate with federal law enforcement at the local level
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:11.200]  going after people's guns to arrest them for guns that are illegal right now today in december of 2020
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:18.560]  you are announcing that you are the domestic enemy that we swore that we would defend this country
[3:42:18.560 --> 3:42:26.400]  against and you federal law enforcement agents i know the pension is sweet you get to target your
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:35.600]  enemies and ignore crimes by democrats it's pretty sweet it's a stasi kgb deal you've got now sweet
[3:42:35.600 --> 3:42:42.240]  pension sweet benefits but i'm telling you there aren't enough of you and if you think you're going
[3:42:42.240 --> 3:42:48.480]  to rely on local law enforcement to be your goon squads so that you can walk in with the raid
[3:42:48.480 --> 3:42:55.680]  jackets after the locals do the heavy lifting i think those days are over local law enforcement
[3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:03.520]  lives among us their kids go to our kids schools we know who they are they're not going to go
[3:43:03.520 --> 3:43:10.240]  go along with this no matter what threats are put on them to help you confiscate guns or
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:16.240]  as it comes to the vaccination question you know refuse entry to places because people
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:23.360]  don't have their vaccine card or the vaccine code on their smartphone it's going to get pretty dicey
[3:43:23.360 --> 3:43:28.320]  being local law enforcement you're really going to be in the spot between the people
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:35.360]  and the feds the feds at this point you know sean hannity saying 99 percent of the feds are great
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:46.240]  guys that is out the window normie ridiculous past history rule of law era bs now we are past that
[3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:53.280]  the supreme court has put the stamp of approval on stealing the presidential election there are
[3:43:53.280 --> 3:44:01.040]  about to put the stamp of approval on stealing the election in georgia with mass mailbox drops
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:08.400]  of fake ballots they're not going to lift a finger they won't do anything but i'll tell you what
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:14.160]  any laws that come out of a biden harris administration are going to be no laws at all
[3:44:14.160 --> 3:44:20.960]  to a lot of americans and these americans are armed to the teeth and when the ballot box is
[3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:28.080]  taken away from us there's only one box left and people had better take this damn seriously
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:35.040]  because we're not joking around we are absolutely not joking around there's a reason you can't buy
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:41.440]  ammunition it's because patriots have been buying it up seeing the storm clouds on the horizon
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:49.200]  so you federal agents had better do it a good long look in the mirror at how much that pension
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:55.280]  is worth are you going to be around to collect it or will there be a government that comes in
[3:44:55.280 --> 3:45:03.760]  after this is hashed out and settled that considers you traders domestic enemies oath breakers
[3:45:05.200 --> 3:45:11.680]  if that happens there won't be a pension this is coming to a fight and that's why the second
[3:45:11.680 --> 3:45:17.280]  amendment was put into the constitution in the first place because that our founding fathers
[3:45:17.280 --> 3:45:24.320]  knew eventually it would come to a fight and when this fight happens we've got a lot of people on
[3:45:24.320 --> 3:45:30.800]  our side the freedom loving side with a lot of experience in special operations and gorilla
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:38.480]  tactics a lot way more than most of the feds that just came out of the uh you know the quantico
[3:45:38.480 --> 3:45:45.360]  school where they're taking a knee for blm is that what they teach in quantico now take a knee
[3:45:45.360 --> 3:45:54.560]  for blm in washington dc the people on my side are hard and we're angry and we're not going to just
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:46:01.280]  roll over while our freedom is stolen away you can steal an election you can put a false president
[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:07.680]  in the white house but you can't make us respect him you can't make us obey any laws that come out
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:15.760]  of a false presidency no laws that come out of a biden hires president presidency will ever be
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:39.840]  obeyed that's done that air is over i'll be back as long as i can
