[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.080 --> 00:39.040]  CBS News reports US soldiers returning from Liberia are held for at least 21
[00:39.040 --> 00:52.200]  days in Italy on a US military base before they are allowed to come back
[00:52.200 --> 00:58.960]  into the United States but then meanwhile the CDC the Centers for
[00:58.960 --> 01:05.880]  Spreading Disease has rebuked the governor of New Jersey Chris Christie
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.520]  saying you need to release the nurse that you believe came in contact with
[01:11.520 --> 01:18.320]  Ebola and who might have it you need to send her home I guess like this other
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.560]  doctor that tested positive with Ebola last week and is now going into the more
[01:22.560 --> 01:26.720]  serious bleeding stages of it the Associated Press was reporting he did
[01:26.720 --> 01:30.560]  his freedom as well to go to a restaurant a bowling alley ride the most
[01:30.560 --> 01:39.440]  busy a-train subway and take cat taxicaps so now governor Cuomo and
[01:39.440 --> 01:44.520]  governor Christie of New York and New Jersey are both saying that okay if
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.920]  somebody's been treating an Ebola patient and they get a fever and look
[01:47.920 --> 01:53.000]  sick we're just gonna let them basically do whatever they want the default
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.640]  with somebody that has drug immune or drug resistant TB and there is drug
[01:59.640 --> 02:02.320]  immune they don't call it that they don't scare the public but there are
[02:02.320 --> 02:07.760]  there's TB out there that you can't cure they lock you up sorry basically for
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.960]  the rest of your life because it will spread and then hundreds of thousands
[02:13.960 --> 02:20.240]  could die back when they couldn't treat TB millions and millions died a year in
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.720]  the US alone you know how many famous people when you read history books even
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.320]  in the 1930s and 40s died they had things called sanitariums that weren't
[02:30.320 --> 02:34.680]  mental institutions they were like these big convalescence places just full of
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.960]  people that had it and it wouldn't matter you know even if you could get up and
[02:39.960 --> 02:45.240]  walk around you go out and play croquet or a lot of had swimming pools it was
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.880]  just kind of a leopard colony that's where you lived and the nurses and
[02:49.880 --> 02:53.480]  doctors that worked there most cases they had it as well so you form your own
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.520]  communities not to spread it well the new progressive thing to do is to share
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.720]  it don't quarantine people that had HIV early on let it go from just a few
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.400]  dozen to millions that have it don't quarantine people that have Ebola in the
[03:09.400 --> 03:14.320]  tens of thousands let millions get it absolutely everybody else is shutting
[03:14.320 --> 03:17.360]  their borders and blocking the flights for two and a half months now almost two
[03:17.360 --> 03:22.720]  and a half months Christy says nurse quarantine for Ebola can go home after
[03:22.720 --> 03:33.680]  he was rebuked by the White House NBC news is reporting right now so White
[03:33.680 --> 03:38.000]  House presses states to reverse mandatory Ebola quarantine orders Obama
[03:38.000 --> 03:49.240]  demands states stop following proper protocol New York Times coming up today
[03:49.240 --> 03:52.720]  Steve Quayle is scheduled to be with us and then Joel Gilbert for a full hour
[03:52.720 --> 04:01.240]  interview I tend to not put out talking points like I should so we can all kind
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.440]  of get a grasp at least on where I'm coming from but it's so crystal clear
[04:06.440 --> 04:11.400]  the flat last few weeks that I should have been beating a drum here because
[04:11.400 --> 04:20.240]  that drum is the truth and it's that they're trying to cover up what's
[04:20.240 --> 04:29.240]  really going on with Ebola until the election is over in what not that long
[04:29.240 --> 04:34.840]  like a week from now so they are covering up what's really going on with
[04:34.840 --> 04:38.640]  Ebola and trying to say there's nothing happening and they have this spin doctor
[04:38.640 --> 04:44.640]  up there is the czar who has no medical background to snow job everybody so we
[04:44.640 --> 04:48.120]  won't find out what's really happening with the Ebola until after the election
[04:48.120 --> 04:51.720]  but all the signs show there's a huge cover-up going on we're being lied to
[04:51.720 --> 04:56.200]  we have a special intro coming up the Jakari Jackson put together stay with

[08:29.000 --> 08:37.240]  day of October 2014 it is extremely crystal clear now studying the global
[08:37.240 --> 08:45.880]  Ebola crisis that Western governments in Europe in England and other areas are
[08:45.880 --> 08:50.000]  trying to block the Ebola coming in and the United States the people running it
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.760]  are doing everything they can to a bring it in and be cover up that it's
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.760]  spreading Steve quell joins us in the second hour today to give us his take
[09:00.760 --> 09:04.880]  and from his sources where he thinks all this is going love him or hate him he
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.120]  wrote books back in the mid-1990s predicting airborne Ebola would be the
[09:09.120 --> 09:12.800]  false flag here in the United States I'm looking forward to hearing what he has
[09:12.800 --> 09:21.920]  to say now that said there are two articles up on info wars dot com and
[09:21.920 --> 09:25.720]  prison planet dot com they're also front and center not hard to find on drudge
[09:25.720 --> 09:28.680]  report dot com because it's the top stories there
[09:28.680 --> 09:37.280]  CDC rebukes Christie the nurse who was treating Ebola patient who was quarantined
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.040]  basically ordered released by the feds when the feds don't even have that power
[09:42.040 --> 09:48.040]  states have quarantine power as well so if we go to drudge we can show folks the
[09:48.040 --> 09:57.880]  front page there CDC rebukes Christie nurse released now linked in red right
[09:57.880 --> 10:01.160]  down below that
[10:01.160 --> 10:12.240]  U.S. soldiers returning from Liberia are being placed in isolation in
[10:12.240 --> 10:20.200]  Vicencia Italy for more than 21 days CBS News reports even though they say that
[10:20.200 --> 10:26.120]  they're not showing any signs of having Ebola that they will be held until they
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.600]  are found to be Ebola free and then they will be shipped back to whatever basis
[10:30.600 --> 10:33.360]  they came from whether it be in Germany or the United States or
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.000]  somewhere else now that is what you're supposed to do when you come out of a
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.520]  hot zone as a medical worker anybody else you're supposed to be held in
[10:44.520 --> 10:48.720]  medical quarantine for 21 days they have the army bases for it they have the
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.440]  hospital ships for it the procedure for doctors without borders I went and
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.040]  looked it up was sure enough to depending on what you're treating and how
[10:57.040 --> 11:03.480]  long it incubates you wait in the country after you've been in the hot zone area in
[11:03.480 --> 11:07.680]  a hotel room or a house so you can monitor yourself once you're out of the
[11:07.680 --> 11:11.520]  main hot zone on the edge of it then you get on an airplane or on a boat and
[11:11.520 --> 11:16.400]  come back and we know these people aren't self-quarantining the doctor last
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.160]  week in New York that was coming back from Africa who had Ebola is now into the
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.400]  next stage of blood coming out of his orifices AP is reporting he's now into
[11:25.400 --> 11:29.720]  that stage of his eyes turning red and all the rest of it he went to the
[11:29.720 --> 11:35.800]  bowling alley and on the a train subway and to restaurants and to the store and
[11:35.800 --> 11:43.800]  now to the cabs just all over the place he's a medical doctor we appreciate him
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.760]  trying to fight Ebola but why would he come back and be sick with a fever
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.960]  running around doing all this why would a nurse from Dallas who treated the
[11:50.960 --> 11:58.160]  Ebola patient out of fever call the CDC and say can I fly oh yes honey go ahead
[11:58.160 --> 12:04.160]  so in those two articles you see the dichotomy the paradox we should do an
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.600]  article just on this itself one of our writers should or somebody should pointing
[12:08.600 --> 12:15.000]  out that the army quarantines people that had been around Ebola what you're
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.880]  supposed to do and the Obama White House does everything it can to stop
[12:24.880 --> 12:28.800]  states from exercising their rights and their duty to quarantine people that
[12:28.800 --> 12:34.960]  have been around the Ebola patient and that have a fever and people are like
[12:34.960 --> 12:38.760]  Alex don't push a police state it's going to be a police state when this
[12:38.760 --> 12:44.560]  thing gets out of hand which is very clear is going on right now because once
[12:44.560 --> 12:50.360]  this starts to spread after the election once they let us know it's
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.720]  spreading if that is indeed the case which it looks like it is every sign
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.640]  post every arrow every alarm every indicator points at that I pray that's
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.920]  not the case the public confidence believes it's spreading the public is
[13:03.920 --> 13:07.880]  not confident in government those polls are out there people know they're been
[13:07.880 --> 13:14.400]  lied to so we've got this whole pantheon of issues going on the military the
[13:14.400 --> 13:21.080]  army is following its procedures and following the law and quarantining US
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.080]  Army personnel five thousand were sent in now when some of them are set to go
[13:26.080 --> 13:33.520]  back out or they're ill they're being sent to a US military base about a five
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.040]  hour flight out of West Africa and they land and they're quarantined not here in
[13:39.040 --> 13:43.680]  the US you're a nurse treating an Ebola patient you have a fever honey you can
[13:43.680 --> 13:52.640]  go that's why I marvel that the default position has been turned off and no
[13:52.640 --> 14:00.200]  reasons have been given now we have a five-year-old boy being tested for Ebola
[14:00.200 --> 14:10.000]  at New York City Hospital at Bellevue Hospital last night and when we're
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.720]  getting more reports from medical doctors who were scared in nurses that indeed
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.600]  people that show signs of Ebola bleeding out of every orifice are being
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.240]  disappeared by federal teams we've had high level board patrol break that down
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.280]  here as well this is going on now do they have Ebola we don't know that but
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.560]  why would they be disappearing them if it was malaria that only causes bleeding
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.560]  in very rare cases and doesn't look like Ebola why aren't they just putting a
[14:35.560 --> 14:42.320]  slide under the microscope and seeing that the parasite isn't there from malaria
[14:42.320 --> 14:51.360]  our story went mega viral around the web we were avalanche crushed in the
[14:51.360 --> 14:58.800]  response from nurses doctors and others saying either they've seen stuff like
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.600]  this happen or heard about it from other health care professionals I hope and
[15:02.600 --> 15:07.280]  pray that it's just panicking and that it but still people are being
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.520]  disappeared that's a huge issue and the controlled corporate press is going
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.920]  along with it notice they had the EAS alert take over all the TV in the
[15:14.920 --> 15:20.440]  country last week and they claim it was a mistake a lot of big stuffs going on
[15:20.440 --> 15:24.520]  we're gonna break it all down but here is a jacari Jackson piece put together a
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.880]  montage with Captain America that I think is extremely powerful where art
[15:29.880 --> 15:34.320]  imitates life or maybe vice versa then we'll come back and get into a bunch of
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.000]  other keen ish stay with us
[15:43.600 --> 15:50.400]  do you want to kill Nazis I don't want to kill anyone I don't like bullies I
[15:50.400 --> 15:55.240]  don't care where they're from I believe Captain America was a composite character
[15:55.240 --> 15:59.520]  that really kind of captured the essence of that generation there's another
[15:59.520 --> 16:03.680]  analogy to be taken from Captain America and that is that that generation and
[16:03.680 --> 16:08.280]  America in general has essentially fallen asleep by Captain America dead as
[16:08.280 --> 16:12.400]  you see him wake up in the second Captain America movie to find that he's
[16:12.400 --> 16:17.120]  living in an authoritarian police state for a second day in a row a group of
[16:17.120 --> 16:20.960]  World War two vets literally took down a barrier blocking off the World War two
[16:20.960 --> 16:28.120]  Memorial in Washington DC well you seem pretty chipper for someone who just
[16:28.120 --> 16:33.120]  found out they died for nothing wow I go protect Iraq he's in Iraq and I come
[16:33.120 --> 16:38.000]  back and I find that my fellow Americans are being attacked by
[16:44.600 --> 16:49.040]  once we're way ahead of the curve I holding a gun to everyone on earth
[16:49.040 --> 16:54.120]  and calling it protection the police and National Guard going street by street
[16:54.120 --> 17:00.560]  house to house instructions to disarm anyone inside gonna neutralize a lot
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.600]  of threats before they even happen without the punishment usually came
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.480]  after the crime and when they say I want my lawyer you tell them shut up your
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.320]  time to get a lawyer you're an enemy combat yes there's some nasty stuff
[17:13.320 --> 17:18.400]  yeah we compromised sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well when I
[17:18.400 --> 17:21.560]  was in Afghanistan they usually kept us outside these buildings and the other
[17:21.560 --> 17:25.440]  government agency guys probably like DEA CIA and all that they would go under
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.360]  these kind of rooms like that exactly and they would be a torturing people
[17:29.360 --> 17:32.640]  from in there horrible scream to hear a grown person like that could be in
[17:32.640 --> 17:36.360]  torture and you're watching as this opium is being grown we provide them
[17:36.360 --> 17:39.760]  security we're providing them resources and we're providing them alternatives
[17:39.760 --> 17:44.960]  Captain America is a fugitive from shield with all due respect if shield is
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.400]  conducting a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why you have a lot of
[17:48.400 --> 17:51.000]  people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.000]  knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques this is
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.600]  only gonna get worse once it starts and again there's no veterans doing
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.360]  anything right now no IEDs they are literally getting the police to pick a
[18:04.360 --> 18:11.600]  fight with veterans you are standing in my brain how did you get here
[18:11.600 --> 18:17.120]  operation paperclip after World War two shield recruited German scientists with
[18:17.120 --> 18:22.600]  strategic values I could have that close operation paperclip explores the
[18:22.600 --> 18:26.880]  secret military program that hired scientists who use slave labor to build
[18:26.880 --> 18:32.160]  the v2 rocket others use concentration camp victims for human experiments the
[18:32.160 --> 18:36.440]  responsibility for the staggering loss of life and property is uniformly placed
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.680]  on Hitler and the Nazis but excluded from the official history is the fact
[18:40.680 --> 18:43.840]  that Hitler and the National Socialists would not have risen to power
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.760]  without the help of international bankers and American and German
[18:48.760 --> 18:53.020]  corporations she's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets
[18:53.020 --> 19:03.560]  under the internet including hydras and shields I think the revelations are
[19:03.560 --> 19:09.800]  terrible because they were they were revealed what's his name
[19:09.800 --> 19:15.680]  Snowden yes Snowden I think he's a traitor what about the others are you
[19:15.680 --> 19:18.960]  planning a rescue mission you think about what is going on with the veterans
[19:18.960 --> 19:22.520]  administration the hospital and the fact that we have veterans that are dying
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.120]  because they're on a wait list we talk about Sergeant Tamarisi and his
[19:26.120 --> 19:40.760]  situation something that I've been upset about raising cane about so I'm gonna ask you about it and that's this right wing was
[19:40.760 --> 19:46.120]  extremism report that was mailed out to law all law enforcement officials in the
[19:46.120 --> 19:50.680]  United States I've apologized for that report it was not authorized to be
[19:50.680 --> 19:56.400]  distributed this is a freedom shield takes the world as it is not as we'd
[19:56.400 --> 20:02.040]  like it to be this can damn near past time you get with that program
[20:02.040 --> 20:12.400]  brawling patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[20:13.440 --> 20:19.400]  well great job to cari Jackson with that special piece we like to do that take
[20:19.400 --> 20:27.360]  actual news that's taking place integrated in with either old news or with
[20:27.360 --> 20:34.840]  fiction or with different pieces of literature to demonstrate common art
[20:34.840 --> 20:40.360]  type of threads throughout history we are skipping this network break we are
[20:40.360 --> 20:45.760]  live broadcasting worldwide I am your host Alex Jones and we are here Monday
[20:45.760 --> 20:55.320]  through Friday 12 noon 3 p.m. Eastern that is 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mountain 9 a.m.
[20:55.320 --> 21:04.600]  to noon Pacific 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time I gotta hand it to the
[21:04.600 --> 21:15.800]  New York Times they either put out horrible deceptive lies that are over
[21:15.800 --> 21:23.680]  the top hoaxes or they put out really good serious investigative journalism I
[21:23.680 --> 21:27.680]  think the New York Times overall for mainstream media is one of the best
[21:27.680 --> 21:36.400]  publications out there for film reviews you name it the problem is when
[21:36.400 --> 21:40.600]  they're being political they will use all the credibility of all the amazing
[21:40.600 --> 21:48.680]  writers and journalists they have they will dump on them in a big way by
[21:48.680 --> 21:53.200]  injecting incredible deception whether it's lies about aluminum tubes and
[21:53.200 --> 21:59.360]  yellow cake from Niger for WMD's in Iraq or saying that the Liberty Movement or
[21:59.360 --> 22:04.120]  a bunch of terrorist the New York Times does it a lot but every day I read the
[22:04.120 --> 22:07.600]  New York Times there are amazing stories there's not a plug for the New York
[22:07.600 --> 22:12.520]  Times I'm just noticing two articles I want to cover right now are out of the
[22:12.520 --> 22:20.880]  New York Times law lets IRS sees accounts on suspicion no crime required and
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.600]  you can't write an article about this and not say it's horrible tyranny and
[22:25.600 --> 22:30.160]  oppressive and out of North Korea which they basically say you can't report on
[22:30.160 --> 22:38.720]  something like this and then not illustrate that it's super bad because
[22:38.720 --> 22:41.240]  other news outlets will report on things like this but they'll say it's
[22:41.240 --> 22:46.480]  wonderful MSNBC whenever the IRS is shaking down churches and going after
[22:46.480 --> 22:50.480]  pro-lifers and going after libertarians and conservatives they say good arrest
[22:50.480 --> 22:56.680]  them all good take their 501c3 away a good audit everybody a good to get rid
[22:56.680 --> 23:01.880]  of free speech on the internet tax the drudge report with the Federal Trade
[23:01.880 --> 23:08.280]  Commission or with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with the FCC
[23:08.280 --> 23:12.640]  bringing the Federal Election Commission that's all been called for in the last
[23:12.640 --> 23:19.360]  year there's new articles out today and see drudge is the big elephant so they
[23:19.360 --> 23:23.760]  can shoot the lead elephant they can shoot all the other ones right beside it
[23:23.760 --> 23:29.000]  and right behind it there it is dims on FCC moved to regulate internet campaign
[23:29.000 --> 23:36.080]  blogs and drudge that's being reported by Fox News and I went and looked that's
[23:36.080 --> 23:45.400]  what they said so I don't want off on a jag about the New York Times but it is a
[23:45.400 --> 23:50.720]  tale of two cities best of times worst of times I read this article yesterday
[23:50.720 --> 23:55.760]  and I didn't do the show David Knight did an excellent job I listened to it
[23:55.760 --> 24:01.520]  had some family issues I did attend to and I said David you want to read this
[24:01.520 --> 24:05.000]  whole article on air and I know he read some of it but I want to read the whole
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.360]  article on air later if I have time because it lets you know that we are
[24:12.360 --> 24:19.120]  living in an incredible tyranny if they can take your life savings and you never
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.560]  even get to see a judge or a jury and there's no indictment no arrest because
[24:23.560 --> 24:28.440]  the IRS agent claimed it showed structuring by a seventy something year
[24:28.440 --> 24:34.320]  old woman who owns a small restaurant and who has no criminal record because
[24:34.320 --> 24:41.040]  daily she would deposit the money for safety in a quote bank and it was never
[24:41.040 --> 24:48.680]  above $10,000 that's because at a diner a little diner usually it was not more
[24:48.680 --> 24:54.440]  than $1,000 that she would make a day people are using credit cards and they
[24:54.440 --> 25:03.160]  said the mere fact and they list a bunch of these cases that you didn't ever put
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.640]  in more than $10,000 to trigger a suspicious report one time I had a big
[25:09.640 --> 25:13.160]  event in LA with several thousand attendants and we've been selling books
[25:13.160 --> 25:18.200]  and DVDs and made about $20,000 sounds like a lot but only half that's profit
[25:18.200 --> 25:21.040]  you know to pay for stuff pay for getting everybody out there but we made
[25:21.040 --> 25:26.200]  about $20,000 over two days and each day because it was on a Friday and a
[25:26.200 --> 25:29.880]  Saturday we would go over to Bank of America at the time was the account I
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.080]  had and I would go in there and they would go are you sure you want to
[25:35.080 --> 25:39.480]  deposit this this will trigger a suspicious report and I'm like what do
[25:39.480 --> 25:44.040]  you mean I just sold a bunch of videos and books yeah and we're gonna pay the
[25:44.040 --> 25:50.280]  stupid tax of the private reserve on this Americans are so cowardly now that
[25:50.280 --> 25:57.200]  I've wanted to give out bonuses before at Christmas party maybe $200 here $200
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.880]  there but to 40 something people it's like five six thousand dollars and you
[26:01.880 --> 26:04.640]  go to the bank and they're and they're acting like you're a criminal to do it
[26:04.640 --> 26:08.680]  and I even that's my in my office let's say cowardly but like really you're gonna
[26:08.680 --> 26:13.680]  get cash out I mean what how did we ever get like this and now the IRS with a
[26:13.680 --> 26:19.200]  straight face tens of thousands of times a year goes in to mainly mom and pop
[26:19.200 --> 26:25.720]  restaurants and shoe repair stores and things that they know full well full
[26:25.720 --> 26:29.640]  well do a cash business and the smart ones I guess just never put it in the
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.440]  bank they just go spend it and do stuff no no you put it in the bank there's
[26:33.440 --> 26:37.200]  there's not even a law they claim it's a law the New York Times doesn't get that
[26:37.200 --> 26:40.980]  exactly right it's it's it's the interpretation of an asset for
[26:40.980 --> 26:45.320]  it's a seizure regulation that the feds put in and that's how cops will pull you
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.320]  over and corrupt jurisdictions and say they've been federalized in that they
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.960]  get the money from the feds they seize it it goes to the feds and they pull an
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.840]  old lady over as their favorite target because they they know the MO of older
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.760]  women especially depression era most of them are dead now to carry a lot of cash
[27:03.760 --> 27:06.920]  on it was they don't trust banks G wonder why they'll have three four thousand
[27:06.920 --> 27:11.000]  dollars pull over that old lady driving new Cadillac man you got cash in there
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.600]  well yes sonny I got two thousand dollars really they screwed up once with
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.480]  the state police she was a multi-billion dollar oil baroness whose famous husband
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.760]  had died she had like five thousand in her purse chicken feed and she showed
[27:24.760 --> 27:28.880]  him and made a big deal out of it they took her money they just said you come
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.600]  on in the station we're gonna test these bills we find drugs on any of it we're
[27:32.600 --> 27:36.960]  gonna indict you they said we're taking the money and they said if you don't
[27:36.960 --> 27:40.000]  like it come on into the station we'll go ahead and you know arrest you and then
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.920]  indict you right there or you can just let me have the money well she drove on
[27:42.920 --> 27:46.280]  down the road and got her lawyers involved but the average person doesn't
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.600]  have a billion and a half dollars in the bank and isn't an old Texan who thinks
[27:51.600 --> 27:56.080]  it's wrong to have cops grab money out of your purse this is pure theft on a
[27:56.080 --> 28:03.120]  monumental stage and they want to hide it in plain view like it's okay it wasn't
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.120]  bad that I didn't want to get mugged in my hotel room for $20,000 and then I
[28:07.120 --> 28:11.320]  went and put it in the bank to then have the accountants run it through the
[28:11.320 --> 28:16.400]  whole system but the way the IRS works is they don't care they will get 96%
[28:16.400 --> 28:20.880]  conviction rates in IRS court and they know people are innocent they've told
[28:20.880 --> 28:25.720]  people I know Treasury agents others that we've had on that we're criminals we
[28:25.720 --> 28:30.480]  know you're innocent we want to put you in jail to shut you up congressman I've
[28:30.480 --> 28:36.120]  interviewed like Hanson no criminal record fighting the IRS in his committee
[28:36.120 --> 28:40.320]  they arrested him he beat him arrested him again beat him again the next time
[28:40.320 --> 28:43.560]  threw him on a plane and then drove him around for over a month in a in a
[28:43.560 --> 28:48.320]  vehicle till his feet burst shackled defecating all over himself this is a
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.440]  criminal mafia and everyone thinks groveling to them will protect you it
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.920]  won't it's illegitimate it it's paid to the private
[28:56.920 --> 29:00.280]  Federal Reserve people say well then why do you pay it because I want to get the

[33:33.040 --> 33:35.920]  making these statements since I mentioned that earlier why don't I just
[33:35.920 --> 33:41.880]  play Tucker Carlson and the Fox News piece where he discusses this so what
[33:41.880 --> 33:46.040]  would it mean to regulate speech on the internet to regulate these ads of the
[33:46.040 --> 33:51.320]  YouTube judge report well I think the I think this portends a great threat when
[33:51.320 --> 33:57.120]  you look at the internet today you'll see hundreds of thousands of postings in
[33:57.120 --> 34:02.240]  all forms from chat rooms to Facebook and social media to websites that people
[34:02.240 --> 34:07.400]  build to put out political messages to YouTube postings and of course blogs
[34:07.400 --> 34:14.520]  right and people have been doing this for a decade or more now and and the
[34:14.520 --> 34:18.840]  American people have become quite accustomed to going online and picking
[34:18.840 --> 34:24.280]  up political commentary and information but if the federal election
[34:24.280 --> 34:29.000]  commission were to start regulating all of those blogs and websites and and
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.880]  social media pages I can't imagine what it would take I take it it would
[34:33.880 --> 34:38.160]  probably require a team of government regulators calling the internet daily to
[34:38.160 --> 34:42.440]  look for violators to look for people who aren't reporting their expenditures
[34:42.440 --> 34:47.920]  online well what is the cost of a blog for example would we have to start
[34:47.920 --> 34:52.080]  sending letters out to all these posters saying how much money did you spend on
[34:52.080 --> 34:56.400]  your blog so I can't imagine a regulatory regime reaching deep into the
[34:56.400 --> 34:59.360]  internet it would have a huge effect on American life that's for sure and I
[34:59.360 --> 35:04.680]  mean no offense everyone respects the FEC but it's an unelected body how would
[35:04.680 --> 35:08.280]  it have the power to regulate political speech on the internet I mean shouldn't
[35:08.280 --> 35:13.800]  Congress be doing that anyway I think you're right let me go back to the point
[35:13.800 --> 35:18.320]  I made just a minute ago the only writ that the federal election commission has
[35:18.320 --> 35:23.960]  to regulate political speech at all is to regulate large expenditures to
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.120]  disseminate speech the Supreme Court recognized that the that the reason we
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.160]  do regulate any speech at all is to prevent corruption of the political
[35:33.160 --> 35:38.680]  system and the corruption that can come from contributions to candidates but you
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.840]  know the internet has been a low-cost mechanism to speak and they're trying
[35:43.840 --> 35:47.440]  to say that if you promote something your pro-gun you shouldn't be able to do it
[35:47.440 --> 35:50.600]  because that's political or that if you're a church you can't say you're
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.200]  against abortion because that's political everything has a political area to
[35:55.200 --> 36:00.120]  it everything can be called political Congress shall make no law respecting
[36:00.120 --> 36:03.720]  the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or
[36:03.720 --> 36:08.760]  the freedom of the press or the people to peaceably assemble and to petition
[36:08.760 --> 36:12.400]  their government for redress of grievances you can go read the First
[36:12.400 --> 36:17.040]  Amendment it's got the press it's got assembly it's got demonstrations it's
[36:17.040 --> 36:23.480]  got expression it's got religious freedom that you cannot make a law it's not
[36:23.480 --> 36:30.240]  your area common sense Bloomberg can spend a hundred million dollars in the
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.440]  last three years that was in Bloomberg last week he spent over a hundred
[36:34.440 --> 36:41.320]  million dollars of his his money gotten from Wall Street insider deals to try
[36:41.320 --> 36:46.560]  to get people like Mike Martinez elected mayor who who says I want to
[36:46.560 --> 36:50.840]  confiscate all guns and he's got enough Californians coming into Austin to do
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.600]  it if he had his way to try to get rid of the sheriff in Milwaukee that said buy
[36:55.600 --> 36:59.520]  guns and protect yourself five hundred thousand dollars got spent trying to get
[36:59.520 --> 37:05.320]  rid of him brought in out of New York City I don't blame New Yorkers they
[37:05.320 --> 37:10.200]  hate their political class but what is New York doing in in in in Wisconsin and
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.680]  in Texas telling people what to do oh but Bloomberg can give his money all day
[37:15.680 --> 37:19.120]  because it's not political that he wants to restrict guns and Bill Gates and war
[37:19.120 --> 37:24.400]  and Buffett I think I'm gonna throw up
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.600]  Bloomberg himself from his own personal money gave 150,000 but you had all the
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.600]  Bill Gates he impacts together five hundred thousand dollars but Dinesh
[37:33.600 --> 37:38.720]  de Souza got three or four friends to give the maximum together in a pool
[37:38.720 --> 37:42.240]  didn't fill out the right paperwork to try to get his friend elected to the
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.720]  Senate running for Hillary seat and he is now spending nine months in a jail
[37:48.720 --> 37:57.800]  and the Orwellian headline was Dinesh de Souza escapes prison you know evades
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.160]  being able to go to prison and you read he's being locked up in one of those
[38:01.160 --> 38:05.280]  minimum security things they don't call a prison because there's two million
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.760]  people in medium and maximum security another five million in these other
[38:09.760 --> 38:12.800]  lockdown facilities they don't they don't like the fact that we have more
[38:12.800 --> 38:15.760]  prisoners anywhere else in the world so they don't call it prisons it's all
[38:15.760 --> 38:23.080]  games ladies and gentlemen now I want to get into the Nazi rat line I want to
[38:23.080 --> 38:28.720]  get into law let's IRS sees accounts on suspicion no crime required how about a
[38:28.720 --> 38:33.720]  headline law let's government agents rape your daughters I mean if they passed
[38:33.720 --> 38:37.600]  the law like that would it be legitimate or would it be illegitimate I don't care
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.760]  if you have a law that black people got to go out and put a yoke around their
[38:41.760 --> 38:47.200]  neck and pull a plow the laws of fraud I don't care if you interpret some
[38:47.200 --> 38:53.360]  regulation you passed you know back in the 80s a reign of terror to quote
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.920]  legalized government robbing old people mainly they mainly target old people
[38:58.920 --> 39:02.280]  that are right at retirement age because they know they just freak out go have a
[39:02.280 --> 39:06.840]  heart attack and their kids don't help them I've identified that pattern and the
[39:06.840 --> 39:13.240]  IRS says they've done a great job they're very proud of themselves Arnold's
[39:13.240 --> 39:18.360]  Park Iowa for almost 40 years Carol hinders has dished out Mexican
[39:18.360 --> 39:24.760]  specialties at her modest cash only restaurant for just as long she deposited
[39:24.760 --> 39:28.560]  the earnings of a small bank branch a block away until last year when two tax
[39:28.560 --> 39:31.840]  agents knocked on her door and informed her that they had seized her checking
[39:31.840 --> 39:37.680]  account almost $33,000 by the way you don't get it back the internal
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.600]  revenue service agents did not accuse mischenders of it money laundering or
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.480]  cheating on her taxes in fact she had not been charged with a crime instead the
[39:45.480 --> 39:50.760]  money was seized solely because she had deposited less than $10,000 at a time
[39:50.760 --> 39:55.520]  which they viewed as an attempt to avoid triggering a required government report
[39:55.520 --> 39:59.920]  she went on and explained with her receipts that she'd never made $10,000
[39:59.920 --> 40:05.360]  well she had made $10,000 in a week that's why the deposits were $500 $1,000
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.520]  $600 and they just said it doesn't matter cupcake we interpret this as that
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.760]  your money's ours and there's other people in this article who've spent
[40:15.760 --> 40:18.280]  hundreds of thousands trying to get hundreds of thousands back and the
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.160]  government will pile in with everything they've got to make sure you got to spend
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.240]  millions to get it back because they want to continue this premeditated
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.720]  racketeering organized crime practice and that's what it is now let's expand on
[40:31.720 --> 40:34.840]  that remember the fellow we had on a couple times a couple years ago it's a
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.960]  look up his name headline from CBS News with a straight face in Chicago was
[40:38.960 --> 40:44.480]  man faces life in prison for filming police they come out to his junk yard
[40:44.480 --> 40:50.440]  that his parents had that he owns they're dead and they haul off a bunch of his
[40:50.440 --> 40:54.080]  50s cars that are worth tens of thousands a piece and they say well we've
[40:54.080 --> 40:57.400]  changed the zoning now you to live out in the county well we call it the city
[40:57.400 --> 41:03.040]  now we're taking your cars so he filmed them so they arrested him Michael
[41:03.040 --> 41:09.720]  Allison just type in the headline Michael Allison faces life in prison and he
[41:09.720 --> 41:15.160]  faced because of the concurrent sentences because then he went and filled
[41:15.160 --> 41:21.200]  them again life in prison and the state sent a state attorney down and pushed
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.400]  for the maximum conviction till the judge said this is Twilight Zone I'm
[41:25.400 --> 41:30.920]  I'm ordering this case dropped guess what they did they the state put money in
[41:30.920 --> 41:39.800]  to try to unseat that judge I mean these people are authoritarian crazies they
[41:39.800 --> 41:45.680]  want to take old ladies everything they got out of the bank no judge no jury no
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.440]  arrest don't nothing they want to arrest and disappear whoever they can they
[41:51.440 --> 41:56.560]  want to put Michael Allison with no criminal record a grease monkey that
[41:56.560 --> 42:04.000]  works on cars and owns his own scrapyard oh a fun guy to go play poker with they
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.560]  don't like that you're not a big giant box store you're not allowed to have
[42:08.560 --> 42:11.280]  lemonade stands not allowed to have farmers markets they're shutting them
[42:11.280 --> 42:15.000]  down everywhere they don't want little people getting together and going down
[42:15.000 --> 42:22.680]  the corner store and buying enchiladas by the way I saw the article David Knight
[42:22.680 --> 42:25.680]  covered it yesterday we guys print it where the illegal aliens shot two cops
[42:25.680 --> 42:31.440]  out in California and he'd been deported twice and had all these felonies and I
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.160]  saw another story where they're still fighting and putting money in to try to
[42:35.160 --> 42:41.080]  unseat any sheriff that will report to ICE Laraza match you the Democratic Party
[42:41.080 --> 42:48.200]  will come run against even Democrats in places like Travis County if they follow
[42:48.200 --> 42:52.160]  the federal law they haven't been able to repeal
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.760]  there to Sacramento area cop shooting suspect had already been deported twice
[42:58.760 --> 43:04.120]  Breitbart and had this huge felony record
[43:04.120 --> 43:11.520]  and then if you arrest someone and you report that they've got felonies and
[43:11.520 --> 43:16.680]  run that through to ICE do you know what the Democratic Party does they they
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.640]  come and and try to throw you out of your Democrat or Republican this is
[43:20.640 --> 43:27.240]  crazy total criminal gang energy where we're gonna take old ladies bank
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.360]  accounts for no reason we're gonna arrest people that film us and try to put
[43:31.360 --> 43:34.880]  them in jail for life on their own property at their junkyard we're gonna
[43:34.880 --> 43:38.800]  let people go that have attacked and have felonies and have been deported
[43:38.800 --> 43:46.440]  twice so they can kill cops it is Twilight Zone so I want to be clear it's
[43:46.440 --> 43:49.280]  not the average cops it's not even the average bureaucrat or even the average
[43:49.280 --> 43:55.200]  IRS person that is a hardcore criminal but it is the people running the system
[43:55.200 --> 44:02.240]  that are and more and more of the criminal energy is so strong that they
[44:02.240 --> 44:07.640]  are boldly trying to crush everyone's will and just come completely out with
[44:07.640 --> 44:11.200]  the most outrageous stuff you can imagine to set the precedent to do
[44:11.200 --> 44:17.080]  whatever they want in this country there are hundreds of thousands of asset
[44:17.080 --> 44:21.760]  forfeiture seizure cases a year in this country where no drugs or anything
[44:21.760 --> 44:27.240]  illegal is found and it's turns out in court the money is completely legitimate
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.320]  someone would have to be crazy to keep all their cash in a bank or keep all
[44:31.320 --> 44:37.040]  their precious metals in a bank heads your bets and all the time you'll hear
[44:37.040 --> 44:41.160]  about they'll swat team someone because they were rumored to have $300,000
[44:41.160 --> 44:45.600]  worth of gold California is really bad on this they they swat team people for as
[44:45.600 --> 44:52.560]  little as $100,000 in gold because a quote informant tells them and then they
[44:52.560 --> 44:55.800]  come and take your gold and you go here's my receipts I bought this gold
[44:55.800 --> 45:01.360]  with after-tax money they go oh you got to prove that the government is out of
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.880]  control do you understand that it's turning into a third-world country or
[45:05.880 --> 45:16.800]  worse Hugo Chavez didn't do stuff like this and he was bad it's outrageous and
[45:16.800 --> 45:20.920]  it just goes on and they put it in the New York Times and admit it's horrible
[45:20.920 --> 45:28.560]  but no one gets in trouble and everybody's scared that only encourages
[45:28.560 --> 45:38.680]  this meanwhile the illegal aliens are above the law actually above the law
[45:41.320 --> 45:48.360]  we have a source inside the military base high-level where US troops are
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.000]  reportedly being quarantined being watched for Ebola that have just been in
[45:52.000 --> 45:57.440]  West Africa battling Ebola we are investigating right now we have breaking
[45:57.440 --> 46:00.480]  news coming up gonna throw that out there might be at the other show might be
[46:00.480 --> 46:06.080]  earlier might be tomorrow but we're on we're on it right now with SSG Joe
[46:06.080 --> 46:12.120]  Biggs and all of his amazing sources that's why we've got Joe in here he's
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.080]  got a lot of great sources and he's willing to get in there get shot rubber
[46:15.080 --> 46:21.360]  bullets go down to the border get the job done that's what I like they say
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.160]  folks don't want to hire veterans for whatever reason all the veterans I got
[46:24.160 --> 46:26.520]  working here are some of the only people that do exactly what I tell them when I
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.200]  tell them I just say go do this well then he goes and does he goes in the
[46:30.200 --> 46:33.720]  Air Force or Joe Biggs go to this he goes and does it it's very refreshing I
[46:33.720 --> 46:37.200]  got great crew this crew does exactly what we want because they do a fabulous
[46:37.200 --> 46:42.520]  job in here every day it's just that that military mindset of getting the job done
[46:42.520 --> 46:49.840]  is amazing but I digress GMOs may be to blame for spike in kids suffering from
[46:49.840 --> 46:54.000]  inflammatory bowel disease I'm gonna cover that it's very important and it
[46:54.000 --> 46:59.320]  ties in to a major biotech firm facing legal blitz over genetically modified
[46:59.320 --> 47:05.360]  corn CDC finally admits that Ebola can float through the air three feet
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.840]  frontline health care workers must protect themselves from aerosol
[47:08.840 --> 47:15.320]  transmission well we don't need the the CDC to tell us this it was kind of like
[47:15.320 --> 47:19.160]  six seven years ago Perino the press secretary was being asked is there
[47:19.160 --> 47:22.840]  inflation is that why oil prices are up she said well I'm not gonna comment on
[47:22.840 --> 47:27.320]  that as if we need to know from her whether there was oil inflation because
[47:27.320 --> 47:36.360]  of a devalued dollar at the time is it daytime outside Perino can I wipe my
[47:36.360 --> 47:41.560]  hind in now Perino is it wrong the IRS has taken people's bank accounts for
[47:41.560 --> 47:47.800]  absolutely no reason and admitting it is child molestation wrong is robbing
[47:47.800 --> 47:52.720]  banks wrong is robbing old ladies wrong we already have a conscience we
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.880]  know what's right and wrong we can't let them define reality anymore so that's

[54:14.120 --> 54:20.640]  iodine x2 from the deeper earth crystal source but nobody else has that's just
[54:20.640 --> 54:25.680]  supercharged my body my energy everything it's that missing link that the
[54:25.680 --> 54:29.040]  system doesn't want people to know about clearly at the current rate we're
[54:29.040 --> 54:33.640]  going to shell out of it very very quickly and we've got a 10 week lead
[54:33.640 --> 54:38.560]  time on getting it in we have put in another order but it's got to be
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.800]  manufactured in the laboratory it's it's it's a deadly gas the form that we
[54:43.800 --> 54:47.720]  have from pure crystals it turns into a gas and has to be done basically by
[54:47.720 --> 54:52.480]  people in spacesuits that produce it we're showing video of it in a petri dish
[54:52.480 --> 54:56.760]  right now being heated up a tiny crystal so again other iodine does not come
[54:56.760 --> 55:00.960]  from this pure deep earth source it comes out of seaweed it is chemically
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.200]  extracted so there's byproducts this is the only iodine like it is the best like
[55:05.200 --> 55:12.320]  it info wars life.com or 8882533139 and I'm just saying that as well to just
[55:12.320 --> 55:15.360]  walked in and told me we're selling out quicker than we thought we had tried to
[55:15.360 --> 55:18.480]  notice we haven't sold out of this in about six months we should always sell
[55:18.480 --> 55:23.840]  out we finally bought a ton of it and I had to of course get more jump through
[55:23.840 --> 55:28.920]  all the DEA hoops and the rest of it and get the crystals and then now we're
[55:28.920 --> 55:32.280]  busy trying to get it manufactured again so you better order your survival
[55:32.280 --> 55:37.400]  shield x2 it's a great gift for friends and family you name it info wars life.com
[55:37.400 --> 55:41.320]  but be sure and consult your healthcare provider physician before using it
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.400]  because you will go through a detox detox within two to three weeks it's not a
[55:44.400 --> 55:48.600]  game so it's not a joke and what it's done for my skin and everything else is
[55:48.600 --> 55:52.480]  just off the chart and iodine has changed my life and so as I got into iodine
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.680]  the last three years I became an expert and I innovated and we now have brought
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.480]  you original survival shield this excellent but survival shield x2 is
[56:01.480 --> 56:03.920]  just off the chart we have plenty of original survival shield but it may be
[56:03.920 --> 56:08.760]  all you can get if it sells out so that's the way this goes info wars life.com
[56:08.760 --> 56:15.920]  or 888-253-3139 I'm gonna stop plugging right there we do have Steve
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.640]  quail coming on right that's a Roger Roger confirmed another was some debate I
[56:20.640 --> 56:23.640]  wanted to get him on for two hours but we already had another guest set up so
[56:23.640 --> 56:28.600]  we had been debating whether we'd move Steve quail he is 100% set up he's be
[56:28.600 --> 56:35.800]  back on Thursday for a part two good good okay here's the headline CNS news
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.560]  suspect and killing of deputies was twice deported it's not that I hate the
[56:40.560 --> 56:44.880]  illegals period a lot of them are hard-working good people it's that
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.120]  they're above the law and of a sheriff for police department reports that
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.760]  their felons this is in the news the Democratic Party comes after you why
[56:53.760 --> 56:59.840]  does the Democratic Party want illegals to be godlike above the law and then
[56:59.840 --> 57:05.760]  every criminal running from justice worldwide comes to the United States but
[57:05.760 --> 57:09.120]  it's an unwritten rule if you're a criminal from Africa or Europe they
[57:09.120 --> 57:13.720]  actually reported it's like a Hispanic mafia but it's not even a Hispanic
[57:13.720 --> 57:17.880]  mafia Hispanics don't want criminals running rampant on the streets I've
[57:17.880 --> 57:22.680]  seen no numbers showing that why do the Democratic Party and the Republicans
[57:22.680 --> 57:28.520]  aiding and abetting them want unlimited criminal illegals with huge felony
[57:28.520 --> 57:34.960]  records not being deported using any fake name they want robbing and stealing
[57:34.960 --> 57:42.800]  and home-invading in Chicago and in Detroit and in New York if you look up
[57:42.800 --> 57:47.000]  the crime waves there's always been the black-on-black is the baseline crime
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.640]  wave killing each other it's terrible but that's what's going on like Charles
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.200]  Barkley came out and said why are black folks only people on average that think
[57:56.200 --> 58:00.040]  having a prison record gives you street cred that needs to change he put out
[58:00.040 --> 58:03.240]  statements and it was attacked for it but that does go on with the whole
[58:03.240 --> 58:07.920]  gangster culture being pushed by MTV but separately it's you've got Latin
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.240]  America emptying out all its criminals how like Fidel sent all his criminals
[58:12.240 --> 58:17.360]  over in the Cuban boat lift it's not that Cubans are criminals on average it's
[58:17.360 --> 58:23.120]  that that was a couple hundred thousand criminals out of jails and that's what
[58:23.120 --> 58:29.080]  Latin America does is use the United States like a giant toilet to dump all
[58:29.080 --> 58:33.560]  the criminals and they're just running around robbing killings molesting
[58:33.560 --> 58:39.160]  drunk driving I am sick of it something has to be done but he's like the
[58:39.160 --> 58:42.340]  political correctness we can't stop flights out of Africa because it'd be
[58:42.340 --> 58:52.680]  racist another major health threat this one in Toledo Ohio where everybody in

[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:19.360]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:26.720]  alex jones steve quayle first guy ever heard talking about airborne Ebola coming
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.320]  after everybody joins us coming up the next segment he'll be with us an hour
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.280]  today on this Monday and an hour on Thursday because you can't just do one
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:40.080]  hour with steve quayle of steve quayle calm okay let me try to hit as much
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:47.480]  shoes I can the short segment before we go to steve quayle I just mentioned this
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:54.680]  and it makes me really angry you know I get mad at the police a lot because the
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.360]  globalists are trying to corrupt them and there are a lot of bad police
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.480]  departments and bad cops out there but by and large police are some of the most
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:05.040]  awake dedicated people I found and folks that hurt me ten years ago asked why
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.320]  have you gone into this police butt kissing frenzy I'm not I've just have
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:12.880]  gotten older got more contacts learn more and and where we get our info and
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.540]  the police on average are one of the most awake groups not as much as the
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.760]  military but secondarily the public is the group that's not that awake and I
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.600]  don't want to get into it for a lot of reasons plus the police still don't want
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.760]  me to this is an ongoing investigation in case others were involved a guy came
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.640]  out here from California staked out wrong places all these wrong addresses
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.640]  people think I work at and later told people he was going to kill me and he
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.080]  was there waiting to do it the awesome police found out about it through
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.520]  people out in California through police out there she also made threats the
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:52.640]  law enforcement got on him picked him up but couldn't charge him that's why
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.000]  Ardee Savetta told me eight months ago you know somebody was here to kill you
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  and we stopped him so better not be bashing us he didn't really say they
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.240]  go you know you ought to be nicer to us and he said oh no we're just doing our
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.320]  job and then I learned the police went after him out there and he killed one of
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.520]  them and so it's just weird to sit here and realize that this kind of stuff's
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.640]  going on and then you hear about two cops being killed by an illegal alien
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:18.680]  I'm I supposed to say illegal alien with political correctness who had a big
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.760]  felony rap sheet and been deported twice and now they're not even going to
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.120]  deport them
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.480]  that these illegals there was that railway killer that they think killed
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.560]  over 15 women mainly Hispanics that's another thing these illegal aliens
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:41.440]  prey on Hispanics and Hispanic areas because for whatever reason I think they
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:45.640]  can get away with it better there and so this is this crime wave just like the
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.680]  black crime wave is hitting blacks the worst this crime wave is hitting
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.920]  Hispanics the worst and it is bad a man suspected of killing two deputies during
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.920]  a shooting rampage in northern California was deported twice to Mexico and
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.720]  had a drug conviction federal authority said Saturday the suspect shooter told
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:07.240]  Sacramento County Sheriff's investigators at the 34-year-old of Salt Lake
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:12.160]  City Marcello Marquez of Salt Lake City however his fingerprints match the
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:18.840]  biometric records of Lewis Monroy back of Monte in federal database US
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:27.640]  immigration and customs enforcement vice said and that's the thing is these
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:31.800]  people are above the law they can have five six seven eight different
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.000]  identities I'll never forget a senator state senator out of Colorado he was a
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.640]  leader of the Senate the time came on my show like 10 years ago since the Denver
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:44.920]  Post I saw the article called got him on he went in a matter of hours got five
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.000]  consulate matricula cards under different comic book character names he
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.680]  went in a big white guy into the Mexican embassy sat there in line and went
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.560]  into the line five times and got five different fake names and with those you
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:07.120]  can go get a bank account a car a house everything it's just a fraud bonanza and
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:12.040]  my question is why are the Democrats why are the feds doing this advertising you
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.800]  got kids want to come have a baby want to come here got a disease come here got
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.280]  a bowl of come here we won't quarantine you will give you free health care it is
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.960]  the plan to wreck the country it is the plan to implode the nation and then
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.040]  when there's a giant crime wave they can say oh give us a bigger police state
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:33.040]  give up more of your liberties will protect you from it and I wonder are
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.640]  the police gonna put up with us forever because I read the news every day
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.480]  religiously hundreds of articles I scan every couple days I read about an
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.000]  illegal killing a copper to and you look at the crime statistics they lead the
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.720]  movement of cop killers so are you do anything about it or you just let the
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.800]  globalist allow armies of criminals to come up here and kill whoever they want
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:05:01.520]  including you the government's Department of Homeland Security is buying

[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:50.840]  cash is suspicious activity CVS post CDC Ebola info at stores I want to go get
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:57.160]  video of that some seem a serious truck convoys as government conspiracy dim
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:04.400]  boss is tea party more extreme than isis she said that on television how will the
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.520]  stock market react to the end of quantitative easing an important
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:15.240]  article another report they just want the money the IRS can now seize accounts
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.360]  on suspicion alone no judge no jury no indictment no nothing to create a total
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.120]  chilling effect and this just in federal judge tosses tea party suits
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:31.360]  seeking permanent protection from IRS targeting that's right the groups are
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:37.200]  still being targeted by the Democrats and their speeches being targeted in
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.600]  violation of the First Amendment truly outrageous and here's the New York Times
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:48.680]  headline law lets IRS sees accounts on suspicion no crime required and it lists
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.000]  the old ladies you name it with no criminal record who just deposit small
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.760]  amounts of cash and even pay taxes on it they say we don't care if you pay taxes
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:01.400]  we are going to take it because we think you're structuring no judge no jury no
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.160]  crime they just have a blank check asset for which are seizure that they
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:12.160]  interpret to make themselves beyond North Korean thugs and everybody else I
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:21.320]  guess just grovels in fear of this the Army Army majoral general has come out
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:27.800]  and said is quarantining troops at a base in Italy getting into the Ebola news now
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:33.560]  and going to our guest Steve quail CDC finally admits that Ebola can float
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:39.520]  through the air three feet they say no the Army report that we posted last week
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:49.040]  to get Daniels wrote about on info wars calm headline Army manual says Ebola can
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.560]  go airborne in cold temperatures and that's indeed what it says it doesn't
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:11:00.360]  get killed by the sunlight or by the heat so those reports are up on info
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.800]  wars calm right now I want to go to Steve quail of Steve quail calm because
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:10.880]  he was the first person back in 1995 96 and he wrote about it before that but I
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:18.640]  read his book who said that they were developing airborne Ebola as a plan to
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.600]  reduce world population quite frankly I had him on and thought I think this guy's
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.360]  for real he means what he says but I think he's gone over the deep end I
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.160]  don't think it's this bad until then they declassified they had developed
[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:36.920]  airborne Ebola and then he said they're chem trailing and spraying aerosols to
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:40.400]  dim the Sun and then they declassified that about a decade after he was the
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.280]  first I saw to write about that in like 94 93 he trailblaze so much of it and I
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.760]  would have him on just out of interest because I knew some of it had to be
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:56.160]  true because I researched it but it was simply mind-blowing how many things he
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:00.160]  first documented and reported on and he's been really freaking out lately
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.160]  the last year so saying wait for the Ebola well here's rolling stone that I
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:14.320]  was in a few years ago and the headline this was from March 17th issue 2011 was
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:22.200]  Snooki on the cover and you tuned to page 50 it says the most paranoid man in
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.240]  America how talk radio host Alex Jones is trying to overthrow the global
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:30.400]  Stasi Borg state this is before Snowden came out we are in a global Stasi Borg
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.320]  state one conspiracy theory at a time and look my conspiracy theory was
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:40.360]  government lab produced airborne Ebola Jones thunders it's coming your way
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.520]  enjoy it yuppies and of course they don't mention that I went on to read a
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:51.040]  government document on air or that we do things like play clips from Nova
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.440]  admitting the army was messing with airborne Ebola and indeed it created it
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.880]  and it's funny I was rereading this article this weekend as people pointed
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:09.040]  this out it reads like a future prediction manual like prophecy Jones
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.320]  reaches more people than any conspiracy crank in US history what do they have
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:21.880]  intellectually that wrote this so just call me a crank it's much easier to call
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.960]  me the most paranoid man in America no I'm not the most paranoid man in America
[01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:33.760]  I'm informed now Steve quail joins us he is a top survivalist then a
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.320]  syndicated broadcaster for 20 plus years written scores of books gotta be 20
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:44.160]  books he can correct me Steve quail.com he hosts the Q files and he joins us for
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.320]  the next 45 minutes actually five minutes the next hour and then he'll be
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:50.880]  back Thursday for a full hour maybe even two hours with us on Thursday because
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.720]  it's yeah we'll do two hours if he can do it so he can take an hour of calls
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.480]  Steve thank you for coming on I want to play a clip from the intro for World War
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:05.560]  Z coming up a little bit later that movie came out last year and they talk
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:09.840]  about airborne Ebola in the intro or they're guessing what the disease is
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:14.040]  they don't know and saying but the UN has decided to not halt air travel out of
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.880]  the areas affected is this part of predictive programming what's happening
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:22.320]  what are your military sources telling you Steve quail what's the next shoe to
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:28.160]  drop is Obama covering up the Ebola spread ahead of the election or do they
[01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.760]  really have it contained Steve quail Alex good morning gun to all your
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.320]  listeners you know greetings first of all let me share what Ebola isn't
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.480]  immediately this is not the hemorrhagic fever that is of the bilovirus this is
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.360]  a bio weapon that has been genetically altered that has been patented by the
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:54.160]  Center for Disease Creation not control that basically has the coordinating
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.680]  vaccines already in the lab vials ready to give out and one of the things that
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.720]  really troubles me and everybody can use three basic facts to search for the
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.760]  truth number one there is no blood hemorrhagic fever is a biosafety level
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:15.360]  for pathogen that is our virus that is so deadly that the people that deal with
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.400]  it and all the bio labs around the world always have positive pressure suits
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:25.240]  they have negative pressure laboratories and the point being Alex is that just as
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.400]  the old commercial said where's the beef and the hamburgers this is where's the
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:35.640]  blood in this this is a psychological operation it is a bio weapon that is
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:43.920]  subpar to the Ebola Ebola was first defined and actually articulated 1976 the
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:51.160]  bottom line is at that point it had an 88 percent kill ratio and Alex I just
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.040]  put up on my website I have a link up on the very top right-hand side Steve
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.720]  quail.com all the news from your site and others on Ebola to try and make a
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:04.120]  central if you will site for people to come to and get the latest news on that
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.960]  obviously we're dealing with something that he is unique in the fact that there
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.600]  is no independent verification that is this is Ebola you know it's funny you
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.640]  say that because a high-level CIA retiree steel said three weeks before this
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.760]  popped up they were going to release an Ebola simulant a real biological but
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.400]  but but a cover for Ebola and a cover or something else and then now on top of
[01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:34.240]  that Obama came out as you know last week and said this is a trial run for a
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.440]  more deadly airborne are they throwing it in our face yes they are they've
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.200]  always thrown our face and it is the Illuminati protocol to mock the stupid
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.320]  people they intend to kill I want to say that one more time it is the Illuminati
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.480]  protocol to mock the people they intend to kill not only they telling you how
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:54.400]  they're going to do it even when they're doing it and let's just look at the
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.440]  Ebola's arm I think you covered this too on your website and on an article this
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:06.840]  is one of the head due genesis in all the world okay I mean this guy is a wol
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:12.320]  absolute without love okay not just leave but without love when you're
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.240]  talking about you remember when you and I used to talk about the globalist
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.960]  wanting just to destroy pretty much nine tenths of the world's population
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:23.880]  Georgia guide stones and all that stuff what does it say when a man who should
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:29.640]  be taking charge is totally silent number one Ebola has been weaponized it
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:35.320]  has been absolutely part of the bio weapons program of not only the United
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:42.240]  States but of Russia and China in 1992 Ken alabak basically defected to bring
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.320]  the news to the West which by the way was greeted with disdain contempt and
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:53.880]  mockery of Ebola pox what people have got to understand is this is the quintessential
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:59.800]  weapon of mass destruction and just as Alex quoted Obama and just as this is a
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.200]  trial run Ebola has been aerosolized when I first broke the news on chemtrails
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:09.160]  and thank you for giving me that credit very few people do what I was concerned
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.040]  with it would be if you will an atmospheric Petri dish or an atmospheric
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:20.040]  laboratory that was basically building the atmosphere up or poison the
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:25.400]  atmosphere so at some later date it would be the ultimate dispersal vehicle
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.480]  for a biological weapon in other words the chemtrails and everything in them
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.320]  barium ceranium all of the different aluminum human blood sites and a human
[01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:40.600]  blood cells leukocytes all the various chemicals benzene etc was a perfect
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.320]  medium at some point in history to introduce this this is why they're
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.600]  saying that in the winter Ebola becomes more quote aerosolized because again
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.480]  they have given it such a charge Alex meaning an electrical charge that it
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.640]  binds with the chemicals the chemtrails spray therefore it falls out by the way
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.320]  I had on a phone conversation the man that was in interviewed one of the
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:09.760]  inventors of anthrax and weaponized anthrax talking about how you can encode
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.520]  it and you can encapsulate it in other words put a protective coating around it
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.800]  and maintain the viability in other words it's total BS it's totalized and
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:23.320]  people need to just look at the laxative so cool way that the people that are
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.400]  doing the cleanup are approaching us I can assure everyone if this were Ebola
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:33.760]  this would be a total different picture every protocol of the CDC isolation
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.680]  containment has been absolutely abrogated Steve I believe you you're
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:42.240]  always on the cutting edge I want to come back then give you the floor and

[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:13.400]  may come a time sometime in the future where we are dealing with a airborne
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:21.120]  disease that is much easier to catch and is deadly and in some ways this has
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:28.080]  created a trial run for federal state and local public health there you go
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.360]  Steve quail is our guest I'm your host Alex Jones his site Steve quail.com
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.440]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com are our sites okay see this is a short
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.880]  segment you've got the floor you've told us what you really think it is and
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.960]  there's a lot of evidence pointing towards what you're saying from your
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:48.360]  sources and watching this from day one are they disappearing people that's the
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.760]  intel we've got how big is it is this part of a larger plan that another
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.600]  government launched this what do you know well first of all yes they are
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:25:00.840]  disappearing people one of the latest things is coming from Kalispell, Montana
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:06.280]  it's on my alerts site Alex just simply because the alerts is the most real-time
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.960]  information I get and they were moved to Missoula the hospital Missoula there's
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.800]  kind of been a news blackout obviously the only people that can order people
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.240]  they shut up are the very same ones that aren't telling us the truth the point
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:25.160]  being is is that from all over from doctors from nurses they are
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:30.480]  specifically saying that people who come into their hospitals and or clinics
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:34.640]  are immediately rushed away to places unknown I want to share something this
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:41.120]  has been total BS and a total lie that it takes days to get an Ebola answer the
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:45.360]  military has equipment that'll do it within less than a half an hour some
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.360]  people told me it's ten minutes and these are people in that field I had a
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:54.760]  molecular geneticist okay wow that's a mouthful send me an email saying upon
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:01.640]  investigation he's finding that these strains of Ebola have if you will sticky
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:07.480]  ends in their DNA so point being they're designed Alex as a bio-weapon to
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:12.120]  incorporate existing diseases whether it's the flu whether it's a cold whether
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:16.440]  it's not stop you Dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the US biological weapons and
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:22.800]  anti-terrorism law he was on last Friday and said it's in the New York Times he
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:29.200]  said Alex they produced what's now being released at Galveston at the UT level
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.880]  four facility that's in level two that we'd always talk so much about and of
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.000]  course Dr. Pionka UT says get ready the airborne Ebola's coming you're all
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.280]  gonna die haha I freaked out connected the dots the FBI did visit him over it
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.120]  but this is really getting creepy when I've got former top CIA people I've got
[01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:50.360]  the guy that wrote the biological weapons treaty and law I've got you I've
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:54.080]  got all these sources saying the same thing this is pretty wild what's the
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.720]  end game what is it then he was saying it's merged he was saying it's merged
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:03.120]  what I've got to say he's saying this new Ebola is meant to tie in to all these
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:06.960]  other known diseases and start super spreading I'm sorry go ahead yeah they
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:12.760]  increased the mutagenic or the ability to mutate into all of their bio weapons
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.760]  developed now look here's what people have got to understand you and I you
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:21.600]  link to it I linked to it I think you did a story on it that by 2025 they're
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.640]  going to claim that the United States population has been lowered to 69 million
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:31.960]  people well excuse me that ought to piss off forgive the language 250 million
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.280]  people who are going to be dead you know and and the fact is when we were
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.560]  telling people that that the globalist now that's just the United States their
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:46.120]  statements over and over and over our global population reduction so the
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:50.280]  point being is that look I have a statement those who've been able to look
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.040]  into the future have always been ridiculed by those who are blind deaf
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.400]  dumb and stupid stuck on stupid or on the government payroll okay the point is
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.800]  that in one sense they want to keep parts of this thing hidden in the other
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.640]  sense they want everybody to know what they're doing so they can rub your
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.080]  nose my nose and our nose is in it and basically now they're saying Alex and
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.280]  this is what my sources are saying it's too late you guys can't stop it well
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.200]  though we can't stop it we can save as many lives as possible and obviously
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.840]  we're going to look at and have to look at self quarantine and look at the fact
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:33.520]  on the 17th of October New York was being prepped for the Ebola outreach and
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:39.280]  all are you know excuse me outbreak and on on almost to the day a week later it
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.840]  happens now look Alex that has nothing to do with fear of
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:47.040]  Hungary and has nothing to do with the when we report you've done you know an
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:52.160]  exemplary job of all this documenting but you know what people don't want to
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:55.520]  think because number one is too scary number two involves personal
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:59.200]  responsibility and number three the outcome is more than they can
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:04.640]  psychologically or emotionally handle so when all of your experts I'm talking
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:09.200]  to molecular biology the same thing I'm talking to generals you know 1976 let me
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.320]  just say this for everybody that wanted to know it's a it was a basis for the
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:19.240]  movie outbreak that was a purely biological or a specific weapon dumped
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.480]  in Africa and I still maintain Alex that this is a race specific weapon when
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.400]  they rush the people back to America they're looking for any excuse me any
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:36.520]  antibodies that they may not have identified in the 360 so it is a test
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.200]  as Obama said to soup it up that's what Boyle's saying it's what Wayne Mads is
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:44.400]  saying it's what you're saying and then now the czar over Ebola says there's too
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.600]  many black people in Africa that's the number one issue is getting rid of those
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.440]  folks we're on the mark leaveable it's so clear buyers on the day there Steve

[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:48.480]  this is what we look into this is what we do and the reason I keep
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:52.160]  interrupting Steve and I know it's obnoxious I can't stand it is I get
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:55.720]  upset because I've intellectually sat here and researched this and then he's
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.720]  saying it and I'm frustrated because I'm neurotic about documenting everything I
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.840]  say as he is and I know when he talks about project coast that it's been
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.760]  declassified on record race specific bioweapons to kill black people I know
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:15.720]  this is mainly killing blacks not whites I know that it's clearly starting to go
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.800]  airborne I know that I told Rolling Stone this was gonna happen back in
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:24.800]  2011 and they made fun of it I know so I'm hearing him talk I'm going oh my
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:35.240]  gosh Wayne Madsen NSA said this steel CIA said this Robert David Steele Dr.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:38.840]  Francis Boyle said this and it's not because they're just saying it they're
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:42.560]  all sourcing documents as well that they would hide last week in the New York
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:51.000]  Times in plain view and admit that facilities in the US were producing the
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.400]  vaccine in the last few years that matches these that's impossible because
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:35:01.400]  these new Ebola has randomly mutated into the cold Bola a cold form based
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.840]  Ebola across that's one out of 87 billion trillion it's impossible so you
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:12.080]  understand they're already making vaccines a years ago that are mutagens
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:16.840]  before this even ever popped up and Boyle who wrote the bioweapons treaty is
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.720]  freaking out over to it's so obvious that's what's crazy now I'm gonna give
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:23.880]  Steve the floor after I play this clip you're just gonna hear him for the rest
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.400]  of the hour and five minutes in the next he'll be with us for two hours on
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:31.680]  Thursday an hour of analysis an hour of calls but I don't need people say how do
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:34.840]  you have so much energy on air well some days I don't when stuff like this is
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:40.200]  going on I'm bouncing off the walls I have three children I know this stuff's
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:46.000]  going on I'm in contact with people at the highest levels of that base there's
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.800]  no quarantine it's an open base the families live on base and off base
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.760]  they're wandering around everywhere troops that have been in the Ebola zone
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.080]  it's just not true we're gonna be breaking that it's the info overload of
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.880]  reality I'm not watching ESPN with shortness of breath over the Seattle
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:09.200]  Seahawks in their quarterback I'm have shortness of breath over this that's a
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.960]  normal response the problem is people don't get upset anymore about things
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:16.840]  they should be upset about now here's a clip from World War Z then we're going
[01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:20.000]  to Steve Quayle I'm giving him the floor to start back over go through
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.320]  everything he said and give you the latest so you just tell me about race
[01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:26.160]  specific bio weapons are in the break I got very upset about it because I'm just
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:30.280]  so sick of this and it's so obvious and it's got to stop and it shows how bold
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:38.480]  these people are here is Brad Pitt here is Brad Pitt here is the intro to World
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:42.240]  War Z last year where they're talking about something spreading and the UN's
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:46.160]  not going to stop the flights see how they're preconditioning you just like
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:50.720]  they show in the new Captain America all new accuracy at the Feds drive and then
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:54.520]  I look the Feds just bought a bunch of accuracy it's all part of a branding
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.160]  rollout everything's a branding rollout and you can see branding rollout just
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.360]  like I knew the CIA or somebody had to go to the X files Chris Carter and say
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:06.640]  we want a government to hijack a jet and fly in the World Trade Center to blame
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.720]  Afghanistan and bring in martial law we're going to use a drill to have nor
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.760]  ad stand down that aired six months before 9-11 and then the X file star
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:22.080]  Dean Haglin shows up at my door and goes you know you're right the CIA came to us
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.840]  and said right that you want that was nine months before then it aired six
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:31.000]  months before this is the world I live in so I see stuff like this and I remember
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.800]  being the movie theater watching this and getting upset and saying that was
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:37.600]  subliminal that was predictive programming when I saw it and the Niko
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:46.160]  reminded me of this last week here's the club the UN health agency is not
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:51.760]  likely to recommend official travel restrictions they're not physicists
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:55.200]  they're not engineers they think it's just gonna go away they live in the
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:12.760]  fantasy parallel okay so the film is all about overpopulation that's why and
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.560]  the books as it's a good thing that the zombies came to destroy the American
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:20.640]  gun owners and we just found a Rockefeller document that Mikhail is on
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.200]  this public three years ago saying they would use Ebola and it shows it
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:31.560]  emanating in the graph out of Africa to bring in tyranny to basically bring in
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.200]  a police state so I give the floor now to Steve Quayle the problem is there's
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:40.800]  just so much data Steve break it down what is it where's it coming from what's
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.360]  the latest what do you think's gonna happen next Steve Quayle okay Alex
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.640]  first of all and most people are dealing with the prude of evil and not going to
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.400]  the root of evil the root of evil is this is a biological weapon it has
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.040]  concurrent with the various forms that are patented by the CDC it's
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.360]  corresponding supposed vaccines that are also patented but taking everyone back
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  to the start of it in the late 70s 1970s South Africa under the direction of
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:15.040]  Wouter Basant BAS an operation coast began work on race specific bio weapons
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:19.660]  it's really critical people understand that it pretty much pioneered if you
[01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:25.800]  could find any genetic marker you could basically build a bio weapon directed at
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:33.880]  that genetic marker this is why in 1976 in Africa they achieve with any Ebola a
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:40.680]  true hemorrhagic fever weapon almost a 90% death rate now interesting Alex that
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.320]  corresponds with the globalist own statements which you've repeated on for
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:48.200]  as long as you've been on the air how many people they want to kill this is
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:54.200]  why they are bringing the I'll say it bluntly the white people back and even
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:59.360]  you know they're living and these are people that have genuinely been exposed
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:08.840]  to the Ebola variant or let's call it this the false Ebola disease okay the
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:14.320]  problem that people cannot relate to and this is it they cannot believe that
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:20.400]  there is a sinister wicked supernatural evil these people are Satanist they
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.800]  hate human life that's the whole basis of transhumanism by the way Alex let me
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:28.840]  say this when I wrote the book breathe no evil and I was on your show back then
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:32.400]  you announced it at the beginning of the stage I will not reprint that book I'm
[01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.760]  down to the last 80 or a hundred copies of that and when my books quite a print
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:42.280]  they go on Amazon I'm astounded on Amazon for three and four hundred bucks so
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:47.960]  ladies and gentlemen I'm telling you breathe no evil laid out the plans now
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:53.600]  of the chemical biological weapons even the gentleman you talked about on the
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.640]  chemical and biological weapons treaty everybody and their dog was
[01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:02.560]  skirting it including the United States let's jump immediately to vaccines if
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:09.440]  nothing if that has been spoken of by the Center for Disease Creation has been
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.840]  true that what makes anybody believe that the vaccines will not have a timed
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:22.680]  release of a of a let's say encapsulated or a secondary pathogen that is in an
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:27.760]  envelope when I wrote breathe no evil I said the plans were even to poison the
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.920]  US mail by using the glue on stamps or the glue on the envelope sealant as a
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:37.400]  growing medium for whatever biological weapon you remember Alex that people
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.600]  were checking the males or putting their their forgive me they were putting
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:45.000]  their mail and packages even through scanners hitting it with ultraviolet
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  light so the point being is that there's a lot of disinformation out there but
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.560]  here's what people got to understand it was less than what two months ago when
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.960]  the president brought the nations of Africa their their rulers pretty much
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.640]  the White House do you remember that yes why is that relevant they were either
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:11.280]  clued in bought off or guaranteed that this was going to break out so what
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.920]  most people don't realize is the race war is something the New World Order
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.640]  wants our blacklisters don't want it people of good faith I don't want it
[01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:26.920]  nobody wants it but they wanted okay so how does this tie in this ties in at
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.720]  some point they will officially release or be forced to release that this was
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:36.760]  there is and all of its forms and variants a race specific bio weapon
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:40.240]  when that comes out that you know what's going to hit the pan by the way I
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:43.920]  believe Lewis Farrakhan's already made I'm not endorsing him I'm just saying
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.080]  he's already drawing that conclusion so as they have been able to identify
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.760]  specific markers and the genetic code of specific races look they could do it
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:59.520]  against blue-eyed blondes they wanted to let everyone understand that when they
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:05.240]  see these events taking place whether it's Ebola scientists being killed in
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:11.240]  the the aircraft over Ukraine whether it's my dead scientist listen one of the
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.080]  most important things Alex is one of the dead scientists I think he's number
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:20.200]  54 57 you have to go on my website check out and the guy had developed the
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:26.760]  universal listen to this the universal antidote to all viruses well sure they
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:32.120]  want to whack him and can I be blunt the greatest disconnect I think of people
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.400]  is when I get emails from them saying well why are these scientists being
[01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:38.080]  killed or molecular biologists or the lead scientist
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:43.280]  biologists biological weapons experts real simple they don't want anybody
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:51.720]  existing other control that can develop a functioning vaccine or also let the
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.120]  cat out of the bag if you're going to destroy 90% of the world now that's
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:00.680]  not fear mongering that's not doom porn that is a specific stated desire there
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.840]  so here's the deal you know don't confuse me with facts as the average
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:10.200]  critic of yours of mine our minds are made up what they have to understand is
[01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:14.560]  they haven't paid the price to basically go and research if they don't have the
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:20.640]  connections you have or I have I had I had a CIA he's dead now top agent spent
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:25.960]  years in Lubyanka prison in Moscow traded for a Russian spy tell me point
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.200]  blank laughingly he said of course we pulled off the whole development
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:37.040]  1970 1976 in the village so when you see that scene an outbreak and I would
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.440]  encourage everybody to see that because ultimately what happens is is that the
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.080]  only thing they can use to pretty much contain it is a fuel air explosive
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.920]  Donald Sutherland's character now why is this predict if you just shared
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:55.600]  obviously that the gentleman what was his name the movie star that came to you
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.000]  knocked on your door and said the CIA told us to write it that was Dean Haglin
[01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.640]  yeah and so when Dean Haglin tells you that do you think people don't get it
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.040]  now I want to tell you where we're headed because I think we're running out of
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:12.280]  time until we get next week the point or I'm sorry on Thursday the point is is
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.800]  we're only talking now about that which most people believe I'm calling it
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.360]  substance acts whether it's Ebola pox mouse box you remember when the story
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:28.400]  broke on mouse box that formula was actually put up on the internet remember
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.520]  that story and in the FBI's credit they tried to stop the other areas of the US
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.000]  government and the Australian government publishing it for those that
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:43.040]  don't know mouse pox in humans kills 98% in his airborne yes sir so the idea
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.240]  that this is quote aerosolized or airborne that's a given okay all
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:53.360]  bio here's the maximum okay all biological weapons are meant to be
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:58.240]  dispersed by air all biological weapons here's something that you won't hear
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.200]  anybody else talk about and I've been talking about it for years 20 years ago
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:07.360]  they proved the electromagnetic attenuation of even the simplest
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:12.280]  viruses and the simplest bacteria could be turned into super viruses a super
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:16.720]  bacteria do you remember when the Moscow embassy was being bombarded with
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.200]  microwave radiation everybody was coming down with cancer yes imagine that
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:26.360]  on a given scale with you've got something that's 70% effective in the
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:32.840]  kill ratio by the way the latest report is this Ebola fake variant of a true
[01:46:32.840 --> 01:46:39.160]  phylo virus has only got about a 50 to 54 percent lethal kill rate still super
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.760]  deadly mark let me expand on this though briefly you were the first just true
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.480]  folks no practice fact to talk about microbiologists back when it was like
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.920]  20 or something and you said they're wiping out all the top people and it was
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.520]  everybody over Ebola or over smallpox getting run over by vans in Houston and
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:59.720]  backed back over being shot being tortured a whole bunch of them were
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:04.000]  sacrificed the sounds insane but police know about it in Virginia and other
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.240]  areas they would go in and the cops would find the microbiologists with
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:11.320]  bloody pentagrams with their guts cut out remember that Steve yes I do so
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:15.360]  there's definitely now it's in the what 400 500 that have been killed and it's
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.520]  been accelerating when you're talking all the pieces are going together and
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:24.040]  then Obama says it's a trial run for something down the road this is super
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:29.240]  creepy but not just the intel Steve I go off my gut and my gut has never been
[01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:34.000]  more concerned what do you think the big end game is in this are they covering
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.720]  it up to laugh at the election is substance X gonna get worse is this
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:41.560]  just a cover like it's hitting us here as well it's about to wipe out you know
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:46.160]  a third of Africa like AIDS did what's happening well first of all they're not
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:51.240]  going to be happy with a third of Africa they're going to be happy with 90% of
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:54.600]  Africa okay they're not going to be what's going to happen United States
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.880]  we'll leave Africa for another date because again you know that's that's the
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:05.240]  test tube of all bioweapons efficacy is Africa going to the United States what
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:08.440]  they're going to do is they're going to have selective breakouts in selective
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:13.160]  cities they're going to control the flow of information and again Alex with no
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.320]  independent verification that they're going to bring city after city under
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:21.400]  martial law first of all they want to check the at the effectiveness of the
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.400]  bioweapon they want to control the mayhem obviously not everyone's going to go
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:32.800]  walk to Lines Central International downtown Chicago New York Dallas
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.720]  wherever and I want the people of Texas to figure this out really simply war has
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.640]  been declared on Texas it's the chemtrails the droughts that has come I
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:48.600]  have come under when your governor met with the administration the mockery of
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:53.640]  governor Perry and at the attack upon Dallas what was the first place
[01:48:53.640 --> 01:48:59.880]  obviously Bola obviously Texas it's too how do I say this it's too in your face
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:07.120]  for even the largest or the most prominent skeptic to deny that Texas has
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:12.080]  been under attack both weather wars and again chemtrails remember this chemtrails
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:18.560]  are an atmospheric petri dish or petri dish so what's going to happen Alex they
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:24.040]  want martial law they want forced vaccination they're going to make a
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:28.880]  case to the public we had to lock up those crazy conspiracies there is because
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.400]  of people believe them well then they won't get the vaccination which will
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:36.320]  save the greater good anybody who tells the truth will be vilified
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.840]  ultimately they'll be nullified and destroyed okay outside the grace of God
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:47.160]  now I believe people need to understand this there is truly the covering grace of
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:52.920]  a living God Psalm 91 and that is what I stake my my faith on the Lord Jesus
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.640]  Christ that is why I guess you know I'm one of the guys sounding the greatest
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.600]  one because I'm about saving lives Alex so are you but if there comes a
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.840]  frustration you come to it and I come to it when I sit at the phone or you sit at
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:09.920]  the radio mic and I say to the Lord I say what's the use Lord what's the use
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:15.600]  how do I stop these malevolent evil creatures that are consuming the
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:19.400]  story they admit they created airborne Ebola to kill black people they admit
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:23.120]  they created HIV people to see show me the document it's declassified in
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:26.680]  Africa it's declassified in the UN reports they caught him sterilizing
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:30.920]  African women look it up folks we can play the BBC clip again and then they
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.720]  have Rolling Stone making fun of us oh ha he thinks the government's making
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:40.240]  airborne Ebola well again Rolling Stone or whoever can make fun of us but they
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:45.320]  can't see all they can do is attack the messenger and what are they gonna do when
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.160]  they get a vaccine their kid gets brain damaged or when they get mousepox I mean
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.240]  the globalists say they're gonna bring in world government release bio weapons
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:55.600]  and wipe us out they're gonna do tests first and I think this is a big test
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:51:01.280]  we'll come back with Steve Coyle this hour brought to you by infidel body armor

[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:37.480]  good thing we have the Berkey system it's the cleanest best water ever mom
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.960]  says it's because the Berkeys filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:46.160]  leaks only pure delicious water I know right you love it too yeah I'm thirsty
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:52.720]  to let's go get some get Berkey clean water by calling 877 886 365 3 that's

[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.080]  will end up crushing a lot of people that work in the government the good news
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:47.920]  is a lot of nurses the military the police you name it every cop I know
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:52.360]  would never take a vaccine and it's just time to understand that's not that the
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:56.120]  science of vaccines aren't real it's that we can't trust these people to give
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:02.320]  us their vaccines they knew 20 years ago that BT corn was causing gut problems
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.880]  and now there's big studies out on it today farmers don't have to feed their

[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.920]  calls but they are trying to get it to spread they are covering it up till the
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.000]  election they do want to set the medical tyranny Obama did sign that
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.280]  executive order unprecedented to secretly quarantine anybody who shows any
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:36.400]  signs of respiratory illness that's what they're using to snatch folks out of
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:41.680]  the hospitals if we go along with this current beta test they will roll out
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.280]  phase two of this they're scientists they are they are mad scientist everything
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:50.600]  they do is done scientifically so yes you can see the rollout how is the rollout
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.080]  going for them because I think if we put enough heat on them they may be forced
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:59.320]  to back off well that's the point in trying to expose darkness the littlest of
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:04.400]  light will cause the deepest darkness to flee and that's why that's why you do
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.760]  what you do and I do what I do Alex here's the deal when I was given the
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.760]  red list the blue list and the green list and remember how many people said
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.360]  all that doesn't that doesn't sound right that government's not keeping a list
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  of people to kill oh yes they are and oh yes they have it was given to me by a
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:23.960]  guy his first name was Gary was head of the Environmental Protection Agency
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.320]  over the Western United States he told me about the list and again I'll run
[01:57:29.320 --> 01:57:33.400]  through it really quickly if I may the red list are gun owners constitutionalist
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:38.760]  Christians people that absolutely believe in an absolute they believe in
[01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:44.120]  right or wrong the blue list are the military and the police who initially go
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:49.280]  along with the government to take to kill and assassinate once they're done
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:53.360]  with their goal they get whacked and then the green list are the people that
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:58.640]  take are taken to the reeducation camps what he said to me almost 20 years ago
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.920]  when I first start on talk radio is when you saw all the appropriations from the
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:06.320]  Environmental Protection Agency for the garbage incinerators you remember that
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:11.360]  he said Steve that's not for garbage that's not for toxic waste that's for
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:16.960]  millions his word I understand he got murdered Alex the millions of corpses
[01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.920]  they're going to deal with now we've seen the coffins we've seen them as
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:25.360]  burial sites but that's all that's all window dressing so to speak that's for
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:29.520]  areas that may be away from the incinerators he also told me an amazing
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:34.760]  fact I've only I think births a subject twice in my life but we'll do the most
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.080]  important thing stay there we're back in one minute with that with that key and

[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:23.960]  me Alex Joe finish up that key term you didn't get to then what the nurses and
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:27.600]  doctors are telling you the intel you're getting and then getting our hearts
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:31.000]  right with God go ahead Steve quail well first of all you know getting our
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.560]  hearts right with God is the very first important thing you know God's word is
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.520]  his kids people are destroyed for lack of knowledge the people in the pulpits
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.360]  better understand I'm talking about the preachers they better start speaking the
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:46.320]  truth than standing up for the truth or basically they become vomited out of
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:51.080]  Jesus mouth that's revelation 316 the word I want everybody to understand the
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.240]  phrase which was given to me by the man who gave the red blue and greenless and
[02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:59.120]  I was the one that broke that story I'm not bragging I'm just saying it's a
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.200]  historic fact and by the way they now admit that they have those lists they
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:07.360]  have those lists he talked about curative process and here's what I want to
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:15.280]  warn every doctor every nurse and every healthcare provider he absolutely blew my
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:21.480]  mind then and it still breaks my heart now okay but their goal is to take away
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:27.160]  the healthcare system to maximize the kill rate and so that's Alex in my
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:31.600]  opinion why the Center for Disease Creation is not being frank is not
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:38.080]  being blunt is in lawyers become the first ones that get killed that's what's
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:44.360]  going on are you there I'm just speechless what should we call this video
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:50.320]  when we put it up on YouTube just like insider reveals the stunning secrets of
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:57.960]  Ebola yep or or or or or basically the end game is you know you always talk
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:03.640]  about Ebola is the end game the end game and you've talked about it but see the
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:08.120]  disconnect in all of us who have warned is that it's happening now this isn't
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.880]  future tense all of the breakouts that will be seen throughout the country those
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.400]  are tests the test number one the bureaucracy of the virus and any
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:23.840]  possible antibodies and anybody who's got an antibody that in effect if anybody
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:28.160]  who survives because the immune system they will become an enemy because if
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.680]  someone gets that okay let's say they go to an independent doctor or an
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:36.840]  independent microbiologist or molecular biologist and he says listen this is
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:40.880]  what's working this is why they're clamping down on even alternatives but I
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:47.120]  want to share something when you have these true BSL for the level you'll see
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:51.680]  the military out in full garb they won't just be dressed in a respirator a
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:57.000]  face mask and yellow or white tieback that's your giveaway this is not a true
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:04.080]  Marburg or a true hemorrhagic fever CCH Crimean CHC Crimean hemorrhagic see
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:09.200]  what is a CHF Crimean hemorrhagic fever and all that that is all of the worst
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:13.000]  nightmares including polio and you know this the United States government
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.880]  wouldn't believe that Soviet Union developed a combination if you will
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.880]  Ebola polio so it is EB 68 let me just share this with everybody that's
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:26.320]  striking young people does it it doesn't strike anybody pun intended that is
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:32.000]  aimed at a specific age group and that is so much paralysis associated with it
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:39.360]  polio people are monsters and there is got to be a an awareness and and if the
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.480]  pulpits by the lie the people die well well the mystery illnesses that wiped
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:48.440]  out people including three of my family members last year and this year the
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:51.640]  doctors said I never see anything like it just people are dying everywhere but
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.040]  see the real stuff they cover up Steve you told me you're being bombarded by

[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:22.520]  where this is life and death okay I and I talked to Alex off the air I said Alex

[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:32.720]  Alex Jones we had him on last week for about 20 minutes and I wanted to get him
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:38.320]  on for a full hour today because this film is so important I know that as
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:41.920]  libertarians or constitutionalist or liberty lovers we understand that
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:46.600]  collectivism is slavery it's a high-tech name for slavery and that
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:52.040]  progressivism is just the current name of the scientific dictatorship or the
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:58.080]  compartmentalization of this kleptocratic society but he has produced a
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:03.160]  new film that we are the exclusive distributor of on DVD until December
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:13.800]  2nd and I wanted to get him on for radio and TV listeners so that we could go
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:18.000]  through his film and actually play a lot of excerpts from it so this will kind of
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.760]  be a documentary this next 50 so minutes here on air we know the
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:29.000]  progressive idea of history is a step-by-step progress to achieve what
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:32.240]  they believe is utopia you hear that from the communists as well
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.560]  Mao Zedong killed 80 plus million people in his cultural revolution and
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:43.360]  great leap forward one child policy was a utopian system it creates nightmares
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:47.480]  the zeitgeist movement I'm not attacking all aspects of it but but the
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.080]  overall you're living a plastic city and in a big dome and a computer will tell
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.960]  you what you eat and what you do that's what the British government's teaching
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:10:00.320]  kids right now with a video series cartoons called mega opolis where you're
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.440]  told where you go you're told what you do your cars are all remote control you're
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:08.360]  not allowed to drive your car time magazine says that the goal in 10 years
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:14.160]  should be no drivers driving cars they are trying to mold the future as if they
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:17.760]  are the people that discovered fire that they're the or harness fire or
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.640]  discovered the wheel that all innovation is from them and notice I'm gonna play
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:29.240]  this clip later Hillary over the weekend said businesses don't create jobs
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:33.320]  because we know that's not true now just like they say two plus two equals five
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:38.960]  you're like that's crazy they have to overthrow reality that's a French
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:43.000]  revolution system wasn't a revolution for people as a revolution of oppression
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.440]  and tyranny it was the Jacobins that's what we're basically under today they
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:53.640]  wanted to overthrow reality in common sense it's all about them being God so
[02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.240]  she said businesses don't create jobs just like if you got a business you
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.760]  didn't build that the master planners did now some master planning of the
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:06.400]  public's involved and wants to agree to it sure works fine but they mean master
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:10.800]  planning every fast for your life that means dumbing you down giving you common
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.800]  core giving you bad food giving you GMO so you fit into their model and don't
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:21.080]  get too uppity real eugenics isn't expand and make the good-looking and smart
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:27.400]  better and then kill the the dumb people it's targeting dumb down the really
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:30.800]  smart people that aren't part of the elite while dumbing down and corralling
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:36.440]  the stupid people before the final extermination so you have to understand
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:41.320]  there's scientific dictators at their core and then when you see all the
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:44.960]  horrible things they do and why they wreck every city they ride that's the
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:49.360]  ether in which they swim their vulture capitalist who aren't free market they
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:53.240]  want to wreck societies so they have full control clowered and pivoted writ
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:59.520]  large agenda 21 how being poor how having nothing is a great idea but the
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:03.520]  elites all live like kings Hillary says there's too many rich people but she's
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.360]  basically tax exempt Warren Buffett same thing they're just the most horrible
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.720]  people you can imagine the Republican leadership the Tory leadership works with
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.680]  them as part of the same ideology behind the scenes but they have to act like
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.800]  they're good guys to fool the public into thinking that they're going to save
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.120]  us in this election cycle the election coming up next week's one of the most
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:30.020]  important ever because you've got a main tea party insurrection that's not
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:32.720]  perfect but it's real people being targeted by the Republican and
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.280]  Democratic leadership who are collecting money George Soros and others are
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:42.200]  paying money right now along with Bill Gates to target along with Bloomberg to
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:46.280]  target Democrats that aren't anti-family or anti-gun some of these old
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:51.160]  Democrats be black white Hispanic they don't care who aren't real members of
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:56.160]  the New World Order they're being removed so this is a takeover scientific
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:01.000]  it's been done in other countries the globalists have organized it and they
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.520]  want absolute tyranny they want to run your life they want to control every
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:10.360]  facet of it they want to take on average more than half of what you make and then
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:16.240]  say you owe them for everything you a business owner didn't hire people I
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:23.000]  didn't start out 20 years ago on my own and have almost 50 crew members I didn't
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.640]  do anything government did all this if you write a book if you write a song
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:31.200]  government did it if you write poetry you didn't do it government did it
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:35.440]  everything is them they're God keep the faith believe in them well the problem is
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:40.760]  where they're taking you as hell on earth as his film shows so the film everyone
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:44.560]  should order it today everyone should show it to friends and family everyone
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:47.800]  should get it and give it as a Christmas or holiday gift everyone should buy a
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.320]  copy and donate it to your library you're probably a hundred people will
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.080]  watch it and then you're also supporting this broadcast and Joel Gilbert
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:59.400]  when we carry his other film it's shockingly powerful dreams of my real
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.720]  father on Obama's true providence I believe it is the truth he joins us now
[02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:07.000]  for the rest of the hour we've got I don't know eight clips or so that we're
[02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:13.320]  going to be playing here on the transmission number one you utopia is
[02:14:13.320 --> 02:14:17.360]  definition progressives in history number two the Wizard of Oz is an allegory
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  number three socialism and human nature number four number five illegals number
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:29.160]  six drug culture number seven islam in Detroit and then number eight he'll get
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.720]  into the effects of this on the victims of it so Joel describe clip number one
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:36.720]  we're going to be going to here thank you for joining us a great to be here
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.320]  Alex clip number one we're going to look at the definition of utopia it's a
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:47.680]  short clip that shows how progressives believe that this idea of utopia which
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:52.880]  was really just a fantasy it wasn't real it started out with Thomas Moore even
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:57.400]  went back to Plato's Republic and then Marx adopted it as his workers paradise
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:02.720]  and in the film we show that modern socialists adopted this fantasy as a
[02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:08.440]  realistic model of today's nation-state and it's failed miserably every time and
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:14.040]  by the way as I said it's eugenics base Plato's the father of eugenics and of
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:18.480]  course eugenics goes back to the Greeks and he said kill all the poor people and
[02:15:18.480 --> 02:15:22.080]  only let the elite breed and then he said no just actually dumb them down and
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:28.640]  control them like animals and so Plato is the master even today two thousand
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:33.720]  four hundred years later of so much that the world is seen I wonder if Plato is
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:40.680]  proud wherever he's at of Mao Zedong well certainly the utopians of the
[02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:45.520]  modern era who murdered a hundred million of their own people in peacetime
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:51.440]  trying to mold them to fit into this perfect world are the evidence that the
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.560]  entire thing was just a fantasy it wasn't real but progressives have taken
[02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:01.720]  this model and they're conducting a war on the mind a war on humanity to force
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:07.240]  us to fit into their utopian ideology and traditional America the traditional
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:11.920]  family the church anything that's a middle-class traditional America
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:17.800]  supports reality free market system the Constitution so the progressives want to
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.920]  destroy that whether it's bringing over millions of illegals or bringing over
[02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:27.600]  people that have Ebola they want to attack the core traditional society
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:31.680]  that will never buy into this utopian nonsense that's right let's play the
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:37.680]  clip the utopia definition progressives main agenda is the creation of the
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:42.840]  perfect future utopia just like the president always says we move towards
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:47.400]  making things better one little step at a time everything is seen as a step along
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.560]  the way so you like my t-shirt I got it off of eBay I like it yeah that history
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:58.080]  is a continual progress the evil fantasy of progressives that they can be as
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:05.520]  gods and recreate the world and make it a better place that's clip number one
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.400]  now let's go to progressives in history tell us about this clip Joel okay so
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:15.280]  here we hear David Horowitz is gonna talk about the progressive methodology to
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:20.240]  murder people that have ideas in their own head he talks about how for instance
[02:17:20.240 --> 02:17:25.960]  the Cambodians murdered everybody with glasses and you'll hear Oprah Winfrey
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:29.640]  you'll hear a female voice it's Oprah Winfrey talking about what she thinks
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:35.620]  should happen to Americans in the South let's play it and Cambodia the
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:39.720]  communists killed everyone who had glasses because of your glasses you
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:47.680]  could read you were educated you have to do something with the people who have
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:51.480]  the bad knowledge in their head so we're gonna start with a clean slate and
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:59.720]  just create new human beings it's a very evil idea in the South there are
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:07.760]  still generations of people and they just have to die they just have to die
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:13.360]  the most evil atrocities of our time have been committed by utopians in power
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:18.120]  they think that they are the divinity that's why they're so dangerous that's
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:24.240]  why they kill so many people it really is true they have the ultimate bold
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.880]  control freaks to say what words we can use don't say the word bossy Michelle
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:32.840]  Obama said she's gonna tell us what to eat and they really believe it they tell
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:37.640]  Africans you can't have houses and cars and air conditioning as Obama is you
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:42.200]  know they're like an imperial god or something they just have no shame who
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:49.160]  are these people at their core at their core they are profoundly misguided and
[02:18:49.160 --> 02:18:55.280]  also they are profoundly egotistical and narcissistic they see them they see
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:19:00.040]  themselves as the gods on earth if they create a utopia on earth they can be God
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:05.840]  God is in heaven reigns over heaven so they see themselves as the divinity on
[02:19:05.840 --> 02:19:11.720]  earth now who is the enemy of God it's the devil so anyone that opposes God or
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:17.000]  anyone that opposes them is evil that's why they call Republicans racists and
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.560]  all these horrible names worse than Isis worse than Isis because you're
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:26.680]  opposing the one true God on earth this is who this is what they they want and
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.080]  if you stand in their way just like Obama's mentor Bill Ayers said in the
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:36.120]  1970s they wanted to put 50 million Americans in reeducation and kill and
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:40.080]  kill 25 million and kill 25 million in the Southwest if they didn't go along
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:44.760]  with this utopian society so the scary thing is this has been tried and failed
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:50.400]  so many times yet today the Democrat Party has been taken over by these
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.680]  rabid right and they're licking their chops for blood at the bottom of the
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:59.920]  rabbit hole is their narcissistic wish to kill everybody sick this winter next

[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.720]  guest going through clips from his new film that everyone should get my
[02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:27.960]  copies over here there's no place like utopia Joel Gilbert film and it does a
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:33.800]  great job of showing the nightmare that is any type of so-called collectivism
[02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:40.960]  done on a mass scale collectivism works great if it's totally free voluntary
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:46.400]  and in a village that they've written books on the subject even socialists
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.880]  have written books in the subject and say it only seems to work when it's
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:52.360]  small and local and people you know vote but bigger than groups of a hundred it
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:55.800]  doesn't seem to work it starts breaking down that's because corruption sets in
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:00.600]  and complexity gets involved and his film gets into that but beyond that with
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:04.680]  Stalin Lenin Hitler Mao all were collectivist all or what you call
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:09.520]  progressives all believe in the power of the state and centralization they just
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.200]  want raw power black uniforms secret arrest rape whoever they want take whatever
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:19.000]  property they want it is a criminal ideology of control freedom driven by
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:25.720]  narcissistic psychopathic borderline personality disorder weirdness breathing
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.040]  demonic life into the state and then you're really in trouble and it always
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:34.360]  wrecks everything in its path it always creates desolation Europe is
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:39.040]  collapsing everywhere socialism has come ends up collapsing ruins families
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:47.400]  ruins cultures ruins just everything but it gives the scum an ether to swim in
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:50.960]  this is a short segment long segment coming up tell us about the Wizard of
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:54.680]  Oz why that's the big angle in your film and we'll play this clip okay the
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:25:59.640]  Wizard of Oz shows how socialism and progressivism relies on a cult of
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:03.760]  personality like this godlike figure will take care of you and do everything
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:09.840]  for you mouth say tongue Che Guevara Lenin Stalin they tried to create from
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:14.840]  Obama this cult of personality character just like the Wizard of Oz the
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:18.880]  wonderful wizard will do everything for you and Michelle Obama was part of that
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:24.880]  in 2008 telling people how great Obama was gonna make your lives better so
[02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:33.800]  let's play the clip Wizard of Oz begins with a tornado and it's the disorientation
[02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:39.720]  everything's topsy-turvy that's the kind of event socials like to create where
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:48.560]  you feel you've lost control to be a nation that is afraid of everyone and
[02:26:48.560 --> 02:27:06.160]  everything well then you land in Oz say oh we're glad you landed in Oz we've
[02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:10.040]  got a wizard here he can solve your problems so we need you to be courage

[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:46.680]  and they know that they're formulaically following what Hitler did with
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.360]  Stalin Mao Pol Pot Fidel Castro Hugo Chavez it came out in the news and I've
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:55.880]  been told by folks that live down there that they have to pray at school for
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:28:01.160]  breakfast and lunch to the government to Hugo Chavez and they have public TV
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.800]  where you pray you go our father who art in heaven hallowed be Hugo Chavez his
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:10.460]  name my socialist kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven these are just total
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:14.680]  whack jobs but I'm sorry go ahead let's go say well Ronald Reagan had a great
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:19.520]  quote that the only places that socialism does work are in heaven where
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:24.200]  they don't need it and in hell where it already exists and and that what they do
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:29.440]  is they use this godlike figure to manipulate naive people people that
[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:33.640]  don't know better and that's why we see today that the entire Democrat Party
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:38.800]  program is based on disinformation fooling people with ideas that the rich
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:43.040]  people are keeping them down that the rich people don't pay enough taxes they
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.080]  make up all these stories to manipulate uneducated people and that's the the
[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:52.840]  beginnings of the demise of a society when they get enough people to follow
[02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:58.440]  along they can impose this socialist hell upon them and then use the tools of
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:03.880]  state to suppress any opposition and control all of the assets of the states
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:06.680]  for themselves we've seen it a million times and that's where we're headed we're
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:09.960]  getting the police state we're getting everything that goes along with it and
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:15.280]  it's true the Democratic Party has just gotten wildly radical really communist
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:19.680]  they use all the same lean forward all this Marxist stuff I mean they mean
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:24.200]  business yeah even the I saw an advertisement for a guy running for a
[02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:29.000]  wolf running for governor in Pennsylvania his entire program was the
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.520]  middle class are getting screwed by the rich people and he wants to fight for
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:39.000]  the middle and lower classes their ideology is a class-based society where
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.160]  people vote their class and that's why they love racism as another former class
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.880]  let's break that down straight ahead and ask why does so many billionaires fund
[02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:53.680]  this then we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN

[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:33.000]  but for a minute it sound like the witch here that part right there riding her

[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:43.160]  the state saying your kids belong to the state and then it cuts a lean forward
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:49.760]  which is a communist term and control the future gain the future running
[02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:54.080]  everyone's lives and we see where it goes let's say they had a great plan they
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.120]  shouldn't be able to make us live by it but they don't even have a great plan
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:02.800]  now Joel's talking about this it's what Charles Barkley came out and talked
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:08.860]  about how he thinks that the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is being
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:12.840]  criticized because he's not quote black enough and it's the same type of
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:19.800]  mentality where oh you know that guy's doing good he must have sold out that's
[02:34:19.800 --> 02:34:23.000]  why they push racism so much they don't have to actually deal with real
[02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.920]  issues now does that mean there isn't racism out there of course there is on
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:30.440]  all sides doesn't mean that there have been evils that had to be right of
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:35.200]  course but they always want to keep it on those areas because they don't want to
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:39.520]  talk about the discrimination of big mega banks getting trillions of dollars
[02:34:39.520 --> 02:34:43.240]  to backup derivatives through the bipartisan banker bailout that's the
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.680]  opposite of free market and is a transfer to the ultra rich so what I have
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:52.320]  found what Ron Paul and others have documented historically is that ultra
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:58.400]  rich George Soros Ted Turner Hillary Clinton's worth a hundred million bucks
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:03.800]  that's pretty super rich Warren Buffett the biggest recipient of the banker
[02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:08.800]  bailout but he goes on TV constantly to say you know my secretary pays more than
[02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.200]  I do that's not right well why'd you lobby to have the laws written like that
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:15.960]  I have almost 50 people working for me in the way they've written the laws now
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:19.720]  we can't write off equipment anything basically now I have to like pay for it
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:24.720]  in taxes like a new studio is is something that I could shell tomorrow it'd
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:30.200]  be worthless tomorrow a big info war studio doesn't matter spend $500,000 on
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.360]  that that's $500,000 Alex Jones made that's where these accrual systems work
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:39.360]  now that was a big globalist company they have it all written and the Arthur
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:44.440]  Anderson type groups to certify it politically and then like general
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.600]  electric you pay zero tax or Google 3% tax and their executives are based in
[02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:54.520]  Luxembourg but for somebody trying to run a small factory or somebody trying to
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.320]  run a media operation or somebody trying to run a restaurant it's written where
[02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:04.960]  you get almost nothing I pay over 70% in one form of taxes or another now again
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:08.440]  I don't run this place just to make money the main goals promote liberty and
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:11.800]  freedom and have a right to property right to raise my children a right to
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:16.280]  religion right to the Second Amendment and so many other things and not be
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:22.200]  conquered it's about not being a slave having an instinct and a mind and a
[02:36:22.200 --> 02:36:26.720]  gut to be free but I realize I've got to have money to be able to fight those
[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:30.960]  battles and be able to have a printing press I'm for a free press everybody
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:35.560]  should own one you don't have to have money to fight on a local scale but you
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:39.840]  got to have it to fight on a world scale so yes we fund ourselves through book
[02:36:39.840 --> 02:36:43.680]  sales video sales t-shirt sales that all promote freedom and educate and
[02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.080]  form and fight back and through high quality supplements that have been
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:50.240]  shown to the amazing things for the immune system the body health you name
[02:36:50.240 --> 02:36:56.080]  it cutting-edge things and in force life.com and then they have Rolling
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:37:02.400]  Stone and Nightline and MSNBC and CBS News and ABC News and everybody media
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:09.640]  matters demonizing me how dare Alex Jones sell products and fund himself yes
[02:37:09.640 --> 02:37:13.360]  you just get it out of a stimulus funds like MSNBC got like a billion bucks
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:16.520]  their parent company hundreds of millions of it went to their NBC and MSNBC
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.560]  division racial matter I've got a raise it was reported on your tax money 400
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:25.120]  something million a year to MPR then they beg for money and that's okay
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:30.320]  because it's Rockefeller radio he's a good rich guy no they're the ultra rich
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:33.760]  that don't want competition that's the other part of the equation and who want
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:37.440]  to dump people down and make it all about hey I don't want to become successful
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:40.880]  in middle-class or wealthy a lot of folks become middle-class and don't want to
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:45.560]  keep working hard to become wealthy I reached that point a long time ago hey I
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.800]  don't need more than you know two cars and a house and and medical care and
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:54.760]  decent clothes I don't worship things so I don't care then I realized people want
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:58.960]  to take it all away from me I need to be strong and built up to defend myself and
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:04.560]  that's coming handy by the way so they want people thinking small so they can
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:07.280]  run the world they don't want you to have dreams they want you playing video
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.120]  games and watching sports and fighting with each other so they can run the
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.160]  world you can't have air conditioning you can't have a car in Africa you can't
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:18.920]  have a house but Obama can fly on a giant jumbo jet with red carpets and
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:23.320]  spend $50 million a day in secret service all these big rich people like
[02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.080]  Michael Moore suing states to stop paying taxes and paying almost no taxes
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:34.240]  and and owning Halliburton and defense stocks the issue is they're totally fake
[02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:41.480]  monsters Al Gore buying some $8 million house right on the beach the same year
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.760]  he said that California by 2013 would be underwater from the melting ice caps by
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:50.560]  the way they're at record size he's never called on it he invented the
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:55.320]  internet he created the planet in seven days just all these lies the disdain
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:58.640]  they after you I'm ranting I'm going back to Joel Gilbert and clips from the
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:04.000]  film it's just that it's not rhetoric about how horrible they are you know how
[02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.960]  Al Gore's dad senator Gore made all his money all his money was being the top
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:14.600]  gopher minion for Armand Hammer who was the main Soviet liaison to the US and
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:21.440]  who ran giant steel mills and factories with slave labor in Russia Al Gore is
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:26.240]  fabulously rich and hides most his wealth and he wants you to pay him carbon
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:31.880]  taxes to breathe while he has buses and jets and more than 10 homes and and
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.600]  you've got Ted Turner saying kill everybody when he's got five kids they're
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:41.440]  the ultimate hypocrites that have decided they run our lives the ultimate
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.160]  form of domination and you sell out to him for chicken feed let's go to
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:51.240]  socialism and human nature and then get Joel Gilbert's take but look in the
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:54.240]  aggregate if we sell 10,000 20,000 copies of this film that's nothing to my
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:58.520]  operation as much as it costs for Joel helps him make his next film but you
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:02.040]  need to support independent media that promotes liberty you need to get his
[02:40:02.040 --> 02:40:06.240]  film and show it to friends and family and I watched the film I grew about 95
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:10.880]  percent of it it doesn't matter if I disagree with some of it what matters is
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:16.240]  overall it's showing what poison collectivism is and how dangerous it is
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:19.360]  and how it's slavery and people are ready to learn this and know this now
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:25.080]  especially folks that have lived under it not the trendies they believe that
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:28.880]  they're part of something big and through extension they're taking over
[02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:32.920]  when they're the biggest chomps let's go to that clip
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:39.240]  socialism is all negative it's a temptation it can bring to anything
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:43.480]  good and I will raise the minimum wage if you can't afford it we will subsidize
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:48.640]  your care man human being is very weak he is vulnerable for temptations
[02:40:48.640 --> 02:40:53.200]  $4,000 tuition credit every student you don't have to pay an income tax you're
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:58.760]  already having a tough time part of human nature belongs to devil part to God
[02:40:58.760 --> 02:41:07.120]  the part below you to devil makes him follow socialism
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:11.400]  whenever you hear I'm gonna cut your taxes give you higher salaries and free
[02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:17.240]  healthcare and free everything don't walk run come in the alleyway man we've
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.960]  got something for you and the guys are clearly thugs Joe Gilbert tell folks
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:26.040]  about who that gentleman was the former KGB officer yeah that was a constant in
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:30.760]  prebe ginski he's a KGB defector a former communist theorist and he's
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:36.080]  throughout the film and he tells all the reality of socialism and communism very
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:40.880]  knowledgeable and he explains that socialism and communism are just a
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:47.960]  fairy tale for illiterate people who are led into essentially the gulag the end
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:52.360]  result of the yellow brick road was not that Dorothy met a wonderful wizard it's
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  that he sent her to the witches castle and she was taken prisoner in the dungeon
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:02.440]  in the in the communist system the flying monkeys get you in the end any time
[02:42:02.440 --> 02:42:06.000]  you hear someone say I'm going to give you all these goodies and we have the
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:11.880]  perfect formula for social change you're gonna end up in prison prison camp is the
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:16.400]  end result of every socialist experiment and you're put there by these
[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:22.160]  leaders who have fake lives and fake backgrounds they're completely pathological
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:26.520]  liars I documented in my last film dreams to my real father that Obama's
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:33.160]  entire personal history political and personal is a lie so I think by promising
[02:42:33.160 --> 02:42:38.000]  people all these wonderful goodies in their mind it's a psychological issue
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.280]  they're trying to relieve themselves of the guilt on the one hand for lying
[02:42:42.280 --> 02:42:45.280]  about everything on the other hand they're bringing their personal
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.440]  destruction in their own life to the public sector and destroying everyone
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:55.800]  else's life that's right misery loves company when poor folks most of them are
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:43:00.160]  working so hard to know Obamacare race payroll taxes to have them say you need
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:03.080]  to be paying income taxes we're gonna get rid of it for poor people and then he
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:08.400]  increased it that is so cold-blooded I mean they it's so sick and then a lot of
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:12.440]  poor folks though that are on welfare I've run into them they really think that
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:17.720]  if you've got a nice house and a car and that if you have them come do a job
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:21.760]  that somehow you're using them when you're actually creating an economy and
[02:43:21.760 --> 02:43:25.720]  that it is the nouveau riche in all the studies that actually create the wealth
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:30.440]  and have the services if they weren't there there'd be nothing what would you
[02:43:30.440 --> 02:43:35.720]  they just don't know how economies work it's it's so sad well instead of the
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:40.320]  president explaining to people like a thank god this guy opened a business and
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:43.480]  he's employing people in the neighborhood and you can get your friend to come
[02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:47.440]  work there and let's support this business and everybody coming by ice cream at
[02:43:47.440 --> 02:43:51.160]  this new ice cream store on the south side Chicago instead the progressive
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:56.000]  mentality is if you opened a business you are evil you did it on the back of
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.760]  someone else it's this Marxist nonsense from the Bolshevik era that Obama was
[02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:08.440]  trained and indoctrinated in his entire life but in my film for example I talked
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:11.880]  to people on south side Chicago and they're saying you know we make $500 a
[02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:17.240]  week but the taxes are taking 200 away so they can't even make it because of the
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:23.080]  taxing you are being paid $500 a week you should be paying no income tax zero
[02:44:23.080 --> 02:44:28.840]  that's common sense and until the 60s no one was charged it's just incredible
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:33.160]  people say well how's the government run off all the other taxes there's hundreds
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:38.680]  of them and they're adding hundreds more yeah well they take a payroll tax of
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:42.760]  course everything is taxed at a high level but the progressive agenda is
[02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:47.400]  just a war on every level of society every economic group and especially the
[02:44:47.400 --> 02:44:51.240]  middle class because they want to eliminate it in socialist economies they
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.560]  don't have a middle class there's an elite class that runs everything and
[02:44:55.560 --> 02:45:00.800]  controls all the wealth and then one big lower class but let's look at the next
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:13.200]  clip it's about the illegals and what they're trying to do
[02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:30.520]  we're recruiting and training Latino organizers we will transform this
[02:45:30.520 --> 02:45:43.800]  nation we can have stations and in the border states a station the state
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:58.440]  to
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:21.360]  I am gonna march with you every step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming every
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:38.800]  step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming every step of the way to make sure that we are
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:47:03.240]  welcoming every step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming every step of the way
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:31.960]  to make sure that we are welcoming every step of the way to make sure that we are welcoming
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:35.720]  called the program that General Parton, the former head of the Air Force Weapons Development,
[02:47:35.720 --> 02:47:39.440]  three-star general used to come on and break down with us. Once they take down a country,
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.800]  they collapse it in socialism, then bring in communism, that's the military occupation.
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.320]  Then they use that country to, quote, target the next country with socialism and then collapse
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.840]  it. And that's what you show in the graphic, is the country collapsing and the communists
[02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:58.440]  take over. They admit that's the plan. Cloward and Pivots is just one variant that I mention
[02:47:58.440 --> 02:48:04.560]  a lot because people know what that plan is. It's so diabolical and so Central and South
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:09.560]  America is collapsing under communism right now and socialism. So they run up here to
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:13.400]  get the free healthcare, but no, that just collapsed their country.
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:19.560]  Well, they're being used, they're being used by our socialists to destroy this country
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:25.460]  as well. The difference between today's socialists and Marxists in the Democrat Party and the
[02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:30.320]  Marxists from the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s is back then they would look you in the eye and say,
[02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:33.680]  we're going to destroy you, we're going to destroy America. Now they look you in the
[02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:38.000]  eye and say, we want to help poor people and then they do the same thing.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:44.320]  They go, oh, it's children when only something like 17% or under 18 and the illegals that
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:48.000]  are coming have huge criminal records. They can get fake identities. How do you become
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.280]  a new person? You don't have to change your identity or anything. You just come to the
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:55.840]  US and be whoever you want, kill as many people as you want, do whatever you want.
[02:48:55.840 --> 02:49:01.000]  Well, here in California, for example, 50% of the prison population are illegals. We
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.720]  have the North days, the Cedennos, different criminal gangs. People coming over the border
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:11.800]  are not people that see America the same way we do. They're people with completely different
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:18.840]  agendas and Obama is lying to everybody with a very evil plan to destroy middle class America.
[02:49:18.840 --> 02:49:22.720]  Right. How long is the next clip on drug culture? Short, 30, 47. Yeah, let's go ahead and play
[02:49:22.720 --> 02:49:23.840]  that clip. Okay.
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:39.320]  Colorado became a proving ground for the progressives and boy, oh boy, have they gone to town.
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:45.320]  Is it possible to get a sample? No. No. How hard is it to get the card? Well, I have
[02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:49.320]  these really high arches. Yeah, let's see. Well, that's a bummer, man. That's a bummer.
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:53.840]  What a bummer. I got to suffer with it every single day. Yeah. The idea of the left is
[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:58.840]  if we can get these traditional ideas broken out, if people can say, well, let's smoke
[02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:02.880]  a little marijuana. What's the heart? Well, then the next barrier left wants to attack
[02:50:02.880 --> 02:50:06.880]  is easier to attack. Well, okay, we do a little marijuana. What about a little bit of marijuana?
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:14.480]  It may be a little bit of cocaine. You created a drug culture and that's an easier culture
[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:20.040]  to captivate, to control, to enslave. And that's why George Soros backs it. And to
[02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:23.720]  be clear, I'm against the drug war. It's another form of evil. They always bring in the crisis
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:28.080]  off of their solution. But now you basically wave your rights. I've looked into these marijuana
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:32.520]  cards and things where people are now put into the system as well. And it's just a way
[02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:37.080]  to control them. So I do agree with your perspective on that. Okay. Let's play the next one. It's
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:41.640]  Islam in Detroit. And I show the connection between the progressive and Islamist ideology.
[02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:45.680]  Well, let's stay there and talk about that teaming up that you cover in the film with
[02:50:45.680 --> 02:50:50.600]  Joel Gilbert in the final segment with our guests. We have a few more clips. We're gonna
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:58.560]  also talk to Peggy Joseph. That's the last clip. Get the DVD at infowarstore.com.
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:03.320]  My name is Dale and I live in El Cajon, California. I was concerned about my cholesterol readings
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:08.200]  because I knew that high cholesterol is related to clogging of the arteries and increases
[02:51:08.200 --> 02:51:13.040]  the risk for heart attack and stroke. One day I heard an ad for heart and body extract
[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:18.560]  and I was skeptical. But I decided to give it a try. Man, the numbers don't lie. Learn

[02:54:14.760 --> 02:54:20.040]  tell the giant poor masses that they've helped create with socialism that anybody with money
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:25.840]  is bad. Well, we know that's not true, but there are corrupt rich actually pushing this.
[02:54:25.840 --> 02:54:30.160]  What they call an Islamophobe, I think it's wrong to go target some of these countries
[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.360]  and overthrow them and put radical Muslims in. I know that's actually the double game
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:39.040]  going on, but it is true that in England, especially in other areas, they're using
[02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:44.740]  Islamic groups to join up with the progressives on the left. You never hear feminists criticizing
[02:54:44.740 --> 02:54:50.280]  radical Islam or any of that stuff to women, and then going after other people's free speech.
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:56.640]  My big issue with a lot of what we see out of Islam is the attempts to restrict Western
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:03.160]  freedom. I am a Westerner. I am into freedom. I'm a libertarian. I'm a paleoconservative,
[02:55:03.160 --> 02:55:07.320]  you could call me, but I don't like a lot of the stuff I'm seeing going on and the
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:12.040]  attempts to shut down my free speech. I see the left teaming up with Islam. Let's play
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:18.560]  that clip, and then we'll all get Joe Gilbert said turning a church into a mosque. And by
[02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:26.160]  adding the Islamic architecture, the arches, and then the minaret, it becomes Islamic architecture.
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:32.240]  You live in the neighborhood. It's been a Catholic church. Then the people left Detroit,
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:37.640]  they lost their following. So the Muslims are here now. I'm going to stop by the American
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:50.160]  Muslim Center. It also looks like a former church, if you ask me. This is who I am. For
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:55.760]  the Jews and for the Israelis, we will say to them the word that the time is going to
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:04.200]  come. This is the Islamic Center, the beautiful mosque. Il Allah, Il Allah. There is no God
[02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:19.160]  but Allah. Muhammad Rasul Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of God. Go ahead and give
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:24.800]  us your take on that. Yeah, that's the clip. Progressives destroyed Detroit. They emptied
[02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:31.200]  the city of all businesses and all people moved away. And Islam moved into Dearborn
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:35.920]  and other places in Detroit. And I went to several churches that were being converted
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:41.760]  into mosques. And a lot of people don't know today that the Obama administration is quietly
[02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:48.360]  approving 10 to 20,000 immigrants from Muslim countries with legal visas every month. That's
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:52.600]  why we see mosques popping up all over the country. And in Detroit specifically, they're
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:57.880]  converting churches. Sure. And some of these are radical sex that are blowing up and burning
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:02.800]  all the churches and killing Christians. And I guess we're kind of not being progressive.
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:06.960]  We should ask them to chop our heads off, right? Well, the Islamists and progressives
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:13.000]  both view Western capitalism, free speech and free markets as an obstacle to taking
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:19.080]  power. Therefore, they are partners in targeting the middle class and the Western free market
[02:57:19.080 --> 02:57:23.480]  system because we're the obstacle to their taking power. And this is why they work together
[02:57:23.480 --> 02:57:28.040]  so closely. And that's why they're against America and against Israel together. Well,
[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:32.440]  again, I have criticism of Israel as well. I try to look at all sides of this, but undoubtedly
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:36.280]  there's persecution of the Christian church and a free speech in this country with the
[02:57:36.280 --> 02:57:42.200]  IRS. And the feds just ruled that persecution will continue federal court today. Well, it's
[02:57:42.200 --> 02:57:49.400]  fine. Chop my head off. I admit it. I'm bad. It's just another area of targeting the, uh,
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:53.160]  the American, the great American middle class that built this country and stands for so
[02:57:53.160 --> 02:57:58.120]  many great principles that save the world time and again. I want to come back and overdrive.
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:02.360]  Some stations won't carry this info wars.com forward slash show folks, but for congruency
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:06.840]  when we post this entire piece on the web tomorrow so people can watch it and see all
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:11.280]  the clips for radio listeners will have this posted on info wars.com tomorrow. We're also
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:16.920]  going to play, uh, the Larry Graphwald clip. Um, he went to prison over his Intel with
[02:58:16.920 --> 02:58:23.240]  their plans to put 50 million of us in forced labor camps and a kill another 25 mill. Now
[02:58:23.240 --> 02:58:27.560]  for population numbers, that'd be more like 75 million slave camps, about 40 mil in the
[02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:31.720]  death camp. Uh, and that's currently pretty much what their plan is. They'd like to put
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:36.920]  me in a camp and you know, stop my brains out and you as well. Cause that's what real
[02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:41.240]  power is all about is them having their way. Cause they're God, by the way, they're fascists.
[02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:51.480]  It might be there, even liberals or socialists. Stay with us live.com today, info wars life.com.

[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:22.920]  And with Joel Gilbert go right into the film. Again, this is a full sneak peek review of the film.
[03:00:22.920 --> 03:00:27.480]  We'll post it in its entirety by the night or tomorrow. It'll be up on info wars.com.
[03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:31.720]  But I just hope people usually I don't push like this with films we promote,
[03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:39.400]  but it just really needs to be seen the exclusive place to get it as info wars store.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:45.000]  Get into Peggy Joseph. The last clip we're going to be playing here today, Joel.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:50.760]  Okay. So Peggy Joseph is the infamous Obama voter in Florida in 2008. They caught her on camera
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:55.720]  saying Obama is going to pay for my gas. He's going to pay for my mortgage. This is fantastic.
[03:00:55.720 --> 03:01:01.720]  So I tracked her down six years later and she told me the story that she was just caught up in the
[03:01:01.720 --> 03:01:06.680]  emotion of the moment because Obama was promising all this stuff and the wonderful Wizard of Oz is
[03:01:06.680 --> 03:01:13.000]  going to save my life and make everything wonderful and that she had actually now educated herself
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:21.480]  and doesn't support Obama and felt he was nothing but a charlatan, another Wizard of Oz.
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:28.360]  Peggy Joseph took her daughter out of school early one day.
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:31.640]  Her emotions ran high following Obama's speech.
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:35.480]  I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car. I won't have to worry about paying my mortgage.
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:47.480]  Hello. Hi. Hi. Are you Peggy Joseph? Yes, I am. I have a present for you. I brought you some
[03:01:47.480 --> 03:01:54.760]  ruby slippers. Slippers? Yes. I didn't order any slippers. I know. Well, I'm making a documentary.
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:01:58.680]  I'd like to talk to you. Do you mind? I won't have to worry about putting gas in my car. I won't
[03:01:58.680 --> 03:02:05.160]  have to worry about paying my mortgage. Did Obama pay for your mortgage? And did he pay for your gas?
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:13.240]  Absolutely not. Mortgage got worse and prices got higher. During that time, we needed a change,
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:18.040]  but a change for the better, not for the worse. He had a very big voice, just like the Wizard of
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:23.480]  Oz. The Wizard with this little teeny, teeny, tiny man. And I think it's the same thing with
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:31.480]  Obama, man behind the curtain. Not who we thought or expected him to be. I was Dorothy in the Wizard
[03:02:31.480 --> 03:02:39.640]  of Oz. That's how I feel. I was Dorothy. I started getting more educated about politics and reading
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:46.920]  more. What I learned is never trust the wizard. It's within ourselves to have the determination,
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:54.200]  the courage, and the brains to bring us to our destiny. Is America still the land of opportunity?
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.440]  100%. It is. Anything that you want to do or become, you can do it in America.
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:05.720]  And that's why they want to wreck it, so that you've got to go to them and they can control you.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:12.360]  I want to play a final clip here. This is, as you mentioned it, the former Green Beret,
[03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:17.960]  who infiltrated the weathermen. These are people that advised Obama and this is what they plan to
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:25.000]  do to Americans. Here it is. And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:33.240]  against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest, where we would take
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:38.760]  all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:45.400]  how things were going to be. I ask, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:52.600]  re-educate that are die-hard capitalists? And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:59.000]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people
[03:04:00.120 --> 03:04:06.200]  in these re-education centers. And when I say eliminate, I mean kill. 25 million people.
[03:04:06.200 --> 03:04:11.960]  That's Larry Grafwold. I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people. That's in the
[03:04:11.960 --> 03:04:20.680]  film. Most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educations.
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:27.240]  Calmly talking about killing 25 million. Figuring out the logistics for the elimination
[03:04:27.240 --> 03:04:32.920]  of 25 million people. And of course, Larry Grafwold is in the film. That's why you need to get it.
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:38.280]  He just died. It was late last year or this year. What a great guy. And imagine having to sit around
[03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:42.360]  for years with the weathermen with airs and all of them talking about blowing up cops and everything
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:46.760]  else. It's truly disgusting. Listen, thank you so much, Joel. We're going to have you back again
[03:04:46.760 --> 03:04:52.280]  soon on the Nightly News as well. And just thank you for making a great film. Definitely get people
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:05:03.720]  thinking. Great job. Thank you. Thank you. Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
