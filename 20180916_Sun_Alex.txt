[00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.288]  It's now only 50 days.
[00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:42.670]  50 days out from what undoubtedly will be the most historic election in world history.
[00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:45.664]  Getting Trump in was only the fluke.
[00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:47.306]  It was only the beachhead.
[00:00:47.306 --> 00:00:49.788]  But you see, the globalists hope it was a fluke.
[00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:50.529]  It really wasn't.
[00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:55.113]  Populism and nationalism is exploding across the globe as we speak.
[00:00:55.113 --> 00:00:59.777]  Thanks for joining us on this live Sunday, the 16th day already of September 2018.
[00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.521]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.704]  And let's get batten down here, batten down the hatches, because
[00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:15.156]  We'll have the latest hurricane news as it deluges the Carolinas in record floods, obviously.
[00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:25.162]  But the big flood is the diarrhea of the mouth coming out of the reanimated corpse, the perfect rotting edifice of the corrupt Democratic Party.
[00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:29.284]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society.
[00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:32.065]  The video's up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:33.526]  But then it gets better.
[00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.407]  Oh, it gets better.
[00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:34.907]  He talks about
[00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.750]  The men in white hoods with torches are coming.
[00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.933]  He's talking about the Democratic Party.
[00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:46.377]  And the Republicans want to have the KKK enslave black people.
[00:01:46.377 --> 00:01:51.201]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:54.984]  But this is the guy they have planning to run against Trump in two years?
[00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:57.967]  I mean, look, Joe Biden
[00:01:59.153 --> 00:02:06.020]  Looks like a dead body that Frankenstein electrocuted and that stood back up on its hind legs.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.386]  So we're going to be playing all of this coming up today and a lot more.
[00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:18.273]  Our favorite socialist dingbat, she's not caught out wearing $3,600 outfits, says she wants $40 trillion of free stuff for the American people.
[00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:26.886]  Even though the entire global elite themselves don't even have 10 trillion dollars.
[00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.067]  They're the ones, by the way, backing her.
[00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:37.128]  But when she was confronted even by liberals that, well, there's only, you know, two trillion dollars out there, discretionary money.
[00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:39.129]  She just said, well, I don't care what you say.
[00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.889]  We're going to do it anyway.
[00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.470]  So that's amazing video.
[00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.891]  But let's get to this first piece and I'll play the larger piece when we come back from break.
[00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:51.632]  This is Joe Biden jumping the shark going further than saying just that.
[00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:54.655]  Trump supporters are deplorable?
[00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.237]  No, no, no, no.
[00:02:56.237 --> 00:03:00.280]  He says Trump supporters are the dregs of society.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.365]  Have you looked in the mirror at the poor sad saps conned by the Democrats?
[00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:07.186]  I mean, they are the dregs.
[00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:15.193]  And then the scum of society, the worst, the Count Draculas of society, are ruling over this throng of pathetic slaves.
[00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:15.593]  Here he is.
[00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:29.480]  Losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.165]  This time, they, not you, have an ally in the White House.
[00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:38.087]  This time, they have an ally.
[00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:43.211]  They're a small percentage of the American people, virulent people.
[00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.913]  Some of them the dregs of society.
[00:03:46.078 --> 00:04:07.738]  And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.
[00:04:07.738 --> 00:04:08.739]  Some of you in this room
[00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:21.052]  Maybe fortunate enough to live in cities or working for companies, or protected by law or by policy, with privilege and access to defend yourselves and your families.
[00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:27.697]  But across the country, too many of our fellow Americans lack those basic comforts.
[00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:31.981]  And that's especially true for young people.
[00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.082]  Many of you are familiar with the Trevor Project.
[00:04:36.505 --> 00:04:39.546]  Alright, well this is just total loads of bull if you know the facts.
[00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:41.866]  I mean, Trump's bringing the prosperity for everybody.
[00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:43.307]  These guys suppress it on purpose.
[00:04:43.307 --> 00:04:45.407]  Look at blue cities they run.
[00:04:45.407 --> 00:04:48.728]  Hell holes of degradation and pain.
[00:04:48.728 --> 00:04:51.708]  It's all coming up on this live global transmission.
[00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.429]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:58.090]  Spread those links or we don't have any hope against these horrible bloodsuckers.
[00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:06.500]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:11.658]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:11.658 --> 00:06:13.604]  Because there is a war on.
[00:06:13.604 --> 00:06:14.507]  For your mind.
[00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:26.211]  It's Sunday, September 16, 2018.
[00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.993]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.993 --> 00:06:31.315]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:31.695]  Central.
[00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:33.577]  We're back weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:06:33.577 --> 00:06:34.137]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:34.137 --> 00:06:40.002]  on all the other great live broadcasts we have that simulcast on AM and FM stations, TV, cable, around the country.
[00:06:40.002 --> 00:06:46.588]  I saw the new talking point over the weekend from CNBC, Reuters, CNN.
[00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:51.372]  After the fall of Alex Jones, the rise and fall of Alex Jones,
[00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.490]  We have a bigger audience than we've ever had.
[00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.750]  I've got our own internal numbers.
[00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.671]  I've shown the videos just a week and a half ago on Twitter before they banned that.
[00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:03.771]  Look, here's Google Analytics.
[00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:06.172]  Record traffic.
[00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:14.914]  But they want that perception that if you don't go along with the globalists, if you don't go along with open borders or gun control, you're not going to get an admission to college.
[00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.614]  You're not going to get a corporate job.
[00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:18.895]  You're not going to have any access online.
[00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:20.155]  You better submit.
[00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:26.461]  So they're trying to bully the American people and now it's come out.
[00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:28.562]  The tables have been turned.
[00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:35.886]  ThinkProgress, another George Soros funded fake news outlet, gets censored by Facebook fact checkers.
[00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:40.028]  Stories up on Infowars.com got picked up by a bunch of publications.
[00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:44.650]  And here they are calling for me to be banned just a few weeks ago and celebrating it.
[00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:50.714]  And they're like, how dare Facebook censor us saying that, you know, Kavanaugh
[00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.024]  said that he wants to overturn Roe v. Wade, which he never said.
[00:07:55.024 --> 00:08:10.198]  And so they had the neocon outfit Weekly Standard come, and they're now part of the fact-checking group, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters and George Soros groups, and Snopes, famously fake.
[00:08:12.076 --> 00:08:14.237]  So that's the group that lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[00:08:14.237 --> 00:08:15.998]  That's the group that was never Trump.
[00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:26.782]  That's the group that has been involved in so much corruption, headed up by Mr. Kristol, whose father was the head of the Trotskyites and the famous communist, worked for Leon Trotsky.
[00:08:26.782 --> 00:08:28.663]  That is one of the worst groups you could have.
[00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:32.385]  But of course they've got the Democrats coming in and censoring.
[00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:39.188]  And now we've got to have token conservatives from the Weekly Standard, who are even worse than the Democrats in many cases, warmongering neocons.
[00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:55.774]  And they'll be the new superclass that decides what's real and not, and so they'll just remove it off Facebook and then give a warning to ThinkProgress that if you do this anymore we may ban you.
[00:08:55.774 --> 00:08:58.035]  Think about that.
[00:08:58.035 --> 00:09:06.339]  A ruling Republican Democrat blue-blood establishment that decides who and who can't post and what's real and what isn't.
[00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:07.720]  Oh, there'll be no one fact-checking.
[00:09:09.076 --> 00:09:26.089]  Weekly Standard or CNN, even though Anderson Cooper got caught standing there up to his chest in a creek, claiming he was amongst flooded houses with his crew all standing around him on dry ground, or the Weather Channel with a guy being blown everywhere and people just stroll right past him like it's no big deal.
[00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:27.830]  We all know what's fake.
[00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.051]  We can make our own decision.
[00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:32.574]  We can smell the truth, as Tucker Carlson says.
[00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:36.317]  So let it all rise or fall and let the people decide.
[00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:48.576]  Don't have fact-checkers, failed CNN, failed New York Times, failed Weekly Standard that loses money every month.
[00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:56.500]  Don't have them as the new superclash that is up there deciding what you can and can't see.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.341]  Let us see it all.
[00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:01.583]  But see, we're not being banned and restricted because InfoWars is a lie.
[00:10:02.517 --> 00:10:07.739]  We're being banned and restricted because what we're saying is the truth and is viral and is infectious.
[00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.619]  And here's the key.
[00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:25.644]  They want to remove us off air so that they can then lie about us and say whatever they want by building a straw man and going to the ring or the arena and beat us up.
[00:10:25.644 --> 00:10:29.385]  And then we don't have a chance to respond.
[00:10:31.476 --> 00:10:34.900]  If you want to see the article, we'll pull it up from infowars.com.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.224]  Anderson Cooper caught in massive fake news.
[00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:47.753]  Anderson Cooper caught in deception of the American people.
[00:10:47.753 --> 00:10:51.777]  Anderson Cooper caught in major performance art.
[00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:54.300]  Can't they even report?
[00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:00.900]  On the weather?
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.260]  Accurately?
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.521]  Can't they even do that?
[00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:08.523]  And the answer is, no they can't because they're all about deception.
[00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:10.924]  They teach in journalism school how to lie now.
[00:11:10.924 --> 00:11:15.867]  Remember Gruber?
[00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:19.408]  Said he was hired by Obama to lie to people and Obama admitted it.
[00:11:19.408 --> 00:11:24.951]  And he's up there at universities giving speeches to graduate students about how to be a better liar and how to deceive people.
[00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.792]  And they're all rubbing their hands together like he's God.
[00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:41.256]  So the fact that they've gotten away with so much to them means, well, Trump only got in because we didn't lie enough, you see.
[00:11:41.256 --> 00:11:44.760]  But they can't have the real fact-checkers out there like InfoWars.
[00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:51.178]  They can't have us there because then it calls them on their lies.
[00:11:51.178 --> 00:12:03.344]  They want to, as a big corporate massive group, lie to us en masse and not have anyone be able to oppose it or respond to it in any way.
[00:12:03.344 --> 00:12:05.326]  Now we come back from break.
[00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:11.709]  A lengthy Joe Biden speech that tells whopper after whopper after whopper.
[00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:15.331]  I'm going to try to just get to a few clips of it and just analyze the lies that are there.
[00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:32.599]  It is like the worst around-the-fire stories you're trying to tell when you're out camping with your dad and your grandpa and they try to scare you when you're five years old and they go, let us tell you the story of the headless ghoul that rides through this area of Texas.
[00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:42.683]  Oh, he's got big red eyes and big long fangs and he's got a forked tail and just legend has it near here a few years ago he grabbed some kids during the night
[00:12:44.124 --> 00:12:51.746]  He's up there going, they ride on horses with white hoods, burning torches and Trump wouldn't stop them.
[00:12:51.746 --> 00:12:53.286]  They're the KKK.
[00:12:53.286 --> 00:13:02.648]  I mean, it is the most ridiculous lies when it's the Democratic Party and the Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act.
[00:13:02.648 --> 00:13:08.890]  Martin Luther King was a Republican, but the public doesn't have history, so they don't know.
[00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.930]  That's all coming up.
[00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:15.243]  In the next segment, and Matt Drudge warns of midterm bloodbath.
[00:13:15.243 --> 00:13:18.944]  Trump to lose 60 seats in the House, like Obama, unless.
[00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:20.865]  We'll give you the unless.
[00:13:20.865 --> 00:13:29.728]  We've got Cortez on how she'd pay $40 trillion for socialist programs with $2 trillion falling flat on her face.
[00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:38.712]  We've got the New York Times and others now saying that, again, Obama gets credit for the economy, but since Trump's getting credit, let's just change how the numbers are looked at.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.061]  Hollywood celebrates Paul Manafort guilty plea.
[00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:43.322]  Checkmate F.U.
[00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:44.462]  Trump.
[00:13:44.462 --> 00:13:49.604]  But it's... He's pleading guilty on not paying taxes.
[00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:50.525]  Fifteen years ago.
[00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:52.025]  So where's your Russiagate?
[00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:54.346]  See, it's not that now.
[00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:58.008]  We're also going to look at young girl raped by a hundred Islamic men.
[00:13:58.008 --> 00:14:01.069]  You'll see how the mainstream media spun that.
[00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:03.190]  And so much more here today.
[00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.940]  And we also have an amazing report by Millie Weaver.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.963]  Democrats are desperate for black vote, but they're not getting it, and that's why they're so scared.
[00:14:12.963 --> 00:14:16.346]  Another key report as well.
[00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:26.814]  When I had Eric Bolling, formerly of Fox News, now with CRTV, here in studio last week, he said, you know, how dare you say there were bombs in the buildings?
[00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:28.936]  How dare you say that?
[00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:32.899]  And I said, Eric, I have clips of Trump saying it.
[00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:33.980]  He said, I want to see them.
[00:14:35.316 --> 00:14:39.660]  We're five minutes towards the end of the show, and I said, I'll make a special video for you.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.362]  And then we'll air it, then I'll send you that video.
[00:14:41.362 --> 00:14:55.896]  So, we're gonna premiere it here tonight, start of the next hour, on Roger Stone's All Big Exclusive News, and then I'm gonna put it up to InfoWars.com on our own video feeds, and we're gonna send that out to Mr. Bowling.
[00:14:55.896 --> 00:15:00.280]  He's a good guy, he means well, he's a boy scout, and he's an economist,
[00:15:02.139 --> 00:15:07.943]  And he just can't believe where I get this stuff that I heard that day there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:15:07.943 --> 00:15:14.307]  Now maybe that's not true, but the media attacked me and said it never happened.
[00:15:14.307 --> 00:15:16.329]  I talked to the police that said no.
[00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:18.890]  The feds were inside building 7 and said get ready.
[00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.912]  They had a 10 second countdown and blew it up.
[00:15:22.128 --> 00:15:22.588]  And guess what?
[00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:27.232]  On PBS, inadvertently, they had the video of the countdown and 7 being blown up.
[00:15:27.232 --> 00:15:28.833]  So you're going to see all that.
[00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:29.834]  It's a 6-minute video.
[00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:33.197]  We've got a 15-minute one coming out Tuesday.
[00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:35.058]  So I'm just going to show you why I question.
[00:15:35.058 --> 00:15:36.819]  Doesn't mean I don't think Islamic terror is real.
[00:15:36.819 --> 00:15:37.540]  None of that.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:44.145]  It means we've been lied to and there's a criminal alliance bipartisanly with radical Islam that needs to stop.
[00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:44.846]  Infowars.com.

[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.481]  X2.
[00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:08.307]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[00:19:08.307 --> 00:19:14.412]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:22.738]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie and there's this purple gas.
[00:19:22.738 --> 00:19:26.021]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:28.183]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[00:19:29.023 --> 00:19:31.405]  I bought a huge amount of it.
[00:19:31.405 --> 00:19:33.087]  Ordered it six months ago.
[00:19:33.087 --> 00:19:34.087]  So I get the price down.
[00:19:34.087 --> 00:19:35.789]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[00:19:35.789 --> 00:19:37.010]  I'm breaking the contract.
[00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.931]  Well, I broke the contract last week.
[00:19:38.931 --> 00:19:41.273]  And so this is potentially the last run.
[00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:45.016]  In fact, right now, it is the last run of Survival Shield X2.
[00:19:45.016 --> 00:19:46.477]  And we've got a good supply of it.
[00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:48.159]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[00:19:48.159 --> 00:19:51.081]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:52.882]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[00:19:52.882 --> 00:19:54.324]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[00:19:54.324 --> 00:19:55.965]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[00:19:55.965 --> 00:19:57.026]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:19:57.026 --> 00:19:58.407]  It's 25% off right now.
[00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:10.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:10.301 --> 00:20:15.287]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:36.905 --> 00:20:44.230]  So, we always hear that Trump is this really mean person, he wants to shut down free speech.
[00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.292]  But he's not calling for shutting down anybody's free speech.
[00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:53.557]  It's the mainstream corporate media that wants all conservatives, all libertarians, all Christians, all veterans groups banned off the internet.
[00:20:53.557 --> 00:20:54.537]  We've got U.S.
[00:20:54.537 --> 00:20:58.280]  Senators Wyden and Warner and Murphy
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.720]  Saying Alex Jones is only the beginning.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.921]  Get rid of thousands.
[00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:04.161]  Get rid of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:21:04.161 --> 00:21:09.642]  We have the Federal Election Commission persecuting anybody that donates to Republicans.
[00:21:09.642 --> 00:21:12.902]  We have the IRS going after churches and Christian groups.
[00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:17.863]  We have a reign of terror and bullying going on.
[00:21:17.863 --> 00:21:27.945]  But then we've got Joe Biden with all of his corruption and protecting Bill Clinton who protected Al Qaeda and then supporting the Arab Spring under Obama and Hillary.
[00:21:29.551 --> 00:21:40.181]  And Uranium One and the KKK background, the Democrats, saying that he wants to pick a fight with bullies, meaning Trump and their supporters.
[00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:52.352]  No, you're the ones beating us over the head with bike locks, throwing coffee on us, shooting Congressman Scalise, calling for Trump's overthrow, calling for the economy to be destroyed so that we can stop Trump.
[00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:53.173]  That's the Democrats.
[00:21:56.087 --> 00:21:59.569]  But now he says we're the dregs of society.
[00:21:59.569 --> 00:22:02.011]  Let's look up the definition of dregs.
[00:22:02.011 --> 00:22:12.017]  It means winos, drug addicts, pickpockets, thugs, child molesters, murderers, ex-convicts.
[00:22:12.017 --> 00:22:13.718]  The lowest of the low.
[00:22:13.718 --> 00:22:18.181]  The remains of liquid left in a container together with sediment or grounds.
[00:22:18.181 --> 00:22:20.002]  The most worthless parts of something.
[00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.974]  The crap inside intestines.
[00:22:23.974 --> 00:22:26.094]  You can take pig intestines and make chitlins.
[00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.775]  Gotta clean out the crap.
[00:22:27.775 --> 00:22:30.016]  Boil the guts and then fry them.
[00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:30.396]  I've had them.
[00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:33.497]  It's a southern dish.
[00:22:33.497 --> 00:22:36.858]  But the dregs would be the guts.
[00:22:36.858 --> 00:22:38.839]  You'd throw out the dregs.
[00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:45.661]  So if you go to a Democratic Party function or a liberal event, they look like they're dead.
[00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.856]  They look like they've been beating the head with a baseball bat.
[00:22:49.856 --> 00:22:51.078]  They stumble around.
[00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:52.721]  Most people can hardly talk.
[00:22:52.721 --> 00:22:55.486]  And I don't feel powerful when I see a group of Democrats.
[00:22:56.263 --> 00:22:57.704]  I feel sorry for them.
[00:22:57.704 --> 00:23:02.507]  And that's why they're really censoring conservatives and nationalists off of Facebook and Twitter and YouTube.
[00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:19.059]  Because we would all, even under censorship, we used to have videos with 30, 40 million views, under censorship routinely a million, two million views, going out and just pointing a camera at a crowd of Democrats with the F your mother, white people are monkey subhumans, you know, we're gonna
[00:23:20.205 --> 00:23:20.886]  Kill you!
[00:23:20.886 --> 00:23:33.500]  And then you go to the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and the next person, and they all sound like something out of a Hellraiser movie.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:40.328]  So when he calls us dregs, think about the projection.
[00:23:41.633 --> 00:23:53.442]  That Joe Biden's involved in because Hillary in the WikiLeaks calls her supporters worthless, dumb, stupid baristas that want something more from her when they're lazy living in their mom's basement.
[00:23:53.442 --> 00:23:54.663]  Close quote.
[00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:57.225]  Trump says, I want to get you out of your mom's basement.
[00:23:57.225 --> 00:23:59.546]  I believe in you, whether you're white or black.
[00:23:59.546 --> 00:24:03.089]  And you see him try to move us an economy back and have a culture of working.
[00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:05.431]  And they flip out and say he's a loser.
[00:24:05.431 --> 00:24:06.792]  He's a crazy man.
[00:24:06.792 --> 00:24:09.294]  He's the worst thing since gonorrhea.
[00:24:10.828 --> 00:24:15.329]  So let's start going to this Joe Biden piece.
[00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:19.090]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society.
[00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.131]  Here he is.
[00:24:20.131 --> 00:24:22.231]  They have an ally.
[00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:27.333]  They're a small percentage of the American people, virulent people.
[00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:29.914]  Some of them the dregs of society.
[00:24:29.914 --> 00:24:32.154]  They have an ally.
[00:24:32.154 --> 00:24:33.835]  So there's your dregs of society clip.
[00:24:34.744 --> 00:24:49.890]  Now let's go to a larger clip where he talks about the KKK riding through the night with burning torches and they're coming to get you like they're telling ghost stories to little kids and they're the people that hate you if you're gay and they're the people that hate you if you're black.
[00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.951]  But here's the good news.
[00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:59.894]  Americans, no matter what color they are or where they came from, are figuring out that the Trump economy is a lot better, that the establishment is against Trump.
[00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:01.375]  So let's go ahead and start going to this.
[00:25:05.302 --> 00:25:07.283]  Gay marriage.
[00:25:07.283 --> 00:25:27.914]  But this onslaught that we're seeing does require, require us not only to be vigilant, but be more aggressive and demand more, demand more of our leaders who represent basic American values of respect, decency, equality, giving hate no safe haven.
[00:25:27.914 --> 00:25:29.114]  Pause.
[00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:31.776]  Giving hate no safe haven.
[00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:52.166]  That means anything they define, the Second Amendment, the nuclear family, saying he or she, being bad in the US, Canada, Sweden, being masculine, being feminine, whatever they want to define as something they want to attack, they say, don't give your speech safe haven.
[00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:53.906]  Believe me, we know bullies.
[00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:55.687]  You're not giving speech a safe haven.
[00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:56.867]  Let's continue.
[00:25:56.867 --> 00:25:58.408]  Behold these truths self evident.
[00:25:59.583 --> 00:26:02.825]  All men are created equal and vowed by their creator.
[00:26:02.825 --> 00:26:13.832]  Sounds corny when you say it, but the American people basically in their gut, we've never met it, but that's the aspiration and they're not giving up on it.
[00:26:13.832 --> 00:26:15.673]  Let's pause again.
[00:26:15.673 --> 00:26:21.296]  It's true that those great ideas have never been met, but the idea of meeting it has brought us further than many other nations.
[00:26:21.296 --> 00:26:22.177]  In fact, probably more than anybody.
[00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:23.810]  The American system.
[00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.531]  So why are we the bad guys?
[00:26:25.531 --> 00:26:27.112]  Why do we have to be the Nazis?
[00:26:27.112 --> 00:26:31.175]  Why do we have to be the evil folks when our history doesn't show that?
[00:26:31.175 --> 00:26:41.903]  But again, this is coming to you from the Democratic Party and somebody that literally was under Senator Byrd, who was a grand dragon in the KKK and the Democratic Party.
[00:26:41.903 --> 00:26:43.144]  But he thinks you have no memory.
[00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:44.825]  Let's continue.
[00:26:44.825 --> 00:26:51.090]  You know, Barack and I agreed to remain silent for a while to give this administration a chance to get up and running in the first year.
[00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.570]  Pause again.
[00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.411]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:26:54.264 --> 00:26:56.006]  They were never quiet through their surrogates.
[00:26:56.006 --> 00:27:05.978]  It came out in all the different documents and lawsuits and FBI files that the Democrats, led by Obama, Hillary and others, have been orchestrating the fake PPGate dossier.
[00:27:05.978 --> 00:27:08.521]  They've been launching the attacks on Trump.
[00:27:08.521 --> 00:27:10.002]  They've been trying to block everything.
[00:27:10.803 --> 00:27:12.184]  Oh, but they gave him a chance.
[00:27:12.184 --> 00:27:13.944]  They tried to make him succeed.
[00:27:13.944 --> 00:27:19.027]  The media, the Democrats, you know, gave Trump that honeymoon period that every other president got.
[00:27:19.027 --> 00:27:21.187]  No, there was no honeymoon period.
[00:27:21.187 --> 00:27:23.308]  They tried to keep him from getting his delegates.
[00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.389]  They tried to keep him from even becoming the president.
[00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:32.612]  They tried to riot and block the entrances to his inauguration and then lied about who was there.
[00:27:32.612 --> 00:27:34.373]  Everything Biden says is a lie.
[00:27:34.373 --> 00:27:35.874]  Continue.
[00:27:35.874 --> 00:27:36.554]  I've given up on it.
[00:27:38.288 --> 00:27:47.911]  You know, Barack and I agreed to remain silent for a while to give this administration a chance to get up and running in the first year.
[00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:56.994]  God forgive me.
[00:27:56.994 --> 00:28:02.115]  I could not remain silent after Charlottesville.
[00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:05.016]  I want to be deadly earnest with you about this.
[00:28:08.388 --> 00:28:09.429]  Charlottesville.
[00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:11.070]  One woman run over.
[00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.491]  God bless her.
[00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:16.953]  By a crowd attacking a car and the guy guns it and runs over her.
[00:28:16.953 --> 00:28:19.955]  And I point out that George Soros funded Antifa.
[00:28:19.955 --> 00:28:21.476]  The police stood down.
[00:28:21.476 --> 00:28:26.518]  You have the alt-right people, who most of them used to work for the Democrats, clearly feds.
[00:28:26.518 --> 00:28:28.960]  You have this big production they do.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.401]  Trump says both sides are bad.
[00:28:31.582 --> 00:28:32.263]  Antifa's bad.
[00:28:32.263 --> 00:28:36.585]  And I think KKK-type folks, KKK likes bad.
[00:28:36.585 --> 00:28:41.529]  But he said it's Antifa that attacked, which is totally true!
[00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:43.470]  And then, oh, this is their big thing.
[00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.432]  This guy funded the Arab Spring that killed millions of people.
[00:28:46.432 --> 00:28:51.555]  Biden and his son runs part of Ukraine, all the stolen natural gas there.
[00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:52.516]  He's a monster.
[00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:56.278]  But he sits there and says America's ethos is the KKK.
[00:28:56.278 --> 00:28:57.319]  No, it's your ethos!
[00:28:58.052 --> 00:29:04.416]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:29:04.416 --> 00:29:07.638]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:29:07.638 --> 00:29:11.341]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:16.044]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:29:16.044 --> 00:29:19.306]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:29:20.206 --> 00:29:31.195]  Our pure tumeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:29:31.195 --> 00:29:39.742]  Regular tumeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our tumeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:50.406]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:19.253]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[00:31:59.304 --> 00:32:02.907]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:32:02.907 --> 00:32:04.668]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:32:04.668 --> 00:32:15.937]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:32:16.718 --> 00:32:25.764]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:32:25.764 --> 00:32:36.452]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:32:36.952 --> 00:32:39.573]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:32:39.573 --> 00:32:41.293]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:32:41.293 --> 00:32:51.295]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:32:51.295 --> 00:32:53.936]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:32:53.936 --> 00:33:02.138]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:33:02.138 --> 00:33:04.839]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.398 --> 00:33:25.021]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:36.714]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:42.220]  So Joe Biden came out and he went beyond saying that Trump supporters are deplorable.
[00:33:43.243 --> 00:33:50.747]  He went on to basically, well, I mean here's the exact quote, the dregs of society, which were already played.
[00:33:50.747 --> 00:34:07.956]  So getting back into his speech, he talks about the KKK riders and their hoods in the night, and like they're galloping, they're galloping, they're galloping like you're in the woods and here comes the evil rider to get you.
[00:34:08.993 --> 00:34:15.756]  Total fear-mongering, and is it lost on society that Democrats are the party of the KKK?
[00:34:15.756 --> 00:34:20.379]  Is it lost on everybody that they're the ones creating racial division in America at every level?
[00:34:20.379 --> 00:34:24.941]  And again, it's even in their own WikiLeaks that they want to create racial division to control people.
[00:34:24.941 --> 00:34:28.983]  Because they're not going to give you jobs, they're not going to give you a future like all the blue cities.
[00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:31.524]  They're going to give you poverty.
[00:34:31.524 --> 00:34:32.865]  They're going to give you enslavement.
[00:34:32.865 --> 00:34:34.886]  They're going to give you being domesticated.
[00:34:39.192 --> 00:34:46.177]  The good news is, you look at the Democratic Party, they're led by Nancy Pelosi, who can hardly talk.
[00:34:46.177 --> 00:34:56.025]  They're led by Joe Biden, who looks like he was a dead body at the morgue that somebody hooked electricity up to, that was reanimated for the speech.
[00:34:56.025 --> 00:35:01.309]  And he's spewing all the same old garbage.
[00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:07.654]  And so that's the good news, is that people are sick of this, and they're tired of it, and they see through it.
[00:35:09.616 --> 00:35:17.982]  Joe Biden is still a clear and present danger because he's not going to ever stop until he realizes that you're not buying into it.
[00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:30.050]  Because as I said earlier, when they overthrew Ukraine, George Soros five years ago, his son took control of the $10 billion gas company that comes out of Russia.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.403]  And he now makes hundreds of millions a year, his son.
[00:35:36.403 --> 00:35:39.106]  That's an example of the criminal looting.
[00:35:39.106 --> 00:35:44.571]  They're not going to stop until the last minute because they're stealing the whole time.
[00:35:44.571 --> 00:35:45.872]  That's why they're never going to back down.
[00:35:45.872 --> 00:35:47.133]  They're never going to give up.
[00:35:47.133 --> 00:35:48.635]  And they're also like cornered rats.
[00:35:48.635 --> 00:35:52.378]  So there's no end to what they will do now.
[00:35:52.378 --> 00:35:53.479]  They are so dangerous.
[00:35:53.479 --> 00:35:54.660]  They are so evil.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:55.241]  Let's continue.
[00:35:57.978 --> 00:36:05.000]  That's why I wrote an article in Atlantic Magazine entitled, The Battle for America's Soul.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.782]  Don't clap, or you can boo if you want, but don't clap.
[00:36:09.782 --> 00:36:11.622]  But I'm serious.
[00:36:11.622 --> 00:36:13.643]  I'm serious.
[00:36:13.643 --> 00:36:19.685]  This is about basic decency.
[00:36:19.685 --> 00:36:26.287]  The idea that goons could come out of fields at night with lighted torches
[00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:37.640]  Carrying Nazi flights, chanting the same exact anti-semitic bile that was chanted in the streets of Nuremberg and Berlin.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.721]  Let's pause again.
[00:36:38.721 --> 00:36:48.772]  Look at how he drools the same anti-semitic bile that was chanted in the streets of Germany.
[00:36:48.772 --> 00:36:49.373]  When it was
[00:36:52.196 --> 00:36:57.118]  George Soros, who was the Nazi collaborator, as the main funder of the Democrats.
[00:36:57.118 --> 00:37:04.381]  When it's Juncker, whose family was the richest family in Germany, as Nazis, who run the EU today, that was a Hitler plan.
[00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:10.163]  When they're the ones using racial division.
[00:37:10.163 --> 00:37:19.547]  But they got it set up in Hollywood like, if you're American and you're pro-freedom, and you're pro-Second Amendment, and you're pro-free market, you are a Nazi!
[00:37:27.904 --> 00:37:44.436]  And now you saw where a guy at the Coast Guard headquarters, being pro-Trump, did this sign, and they removed him, fired him off the job, and then the Coast Guard apologized for the Nazi sign.
[00:37:44.436 --> 00:37:50.100]  Well, I say that the Apple sign, which we're getting rid of in the company, because it's so fascist working with China now,
[00:37:51.022 --> 00:37:58.644]  I say it's a sign that supports China that kills more people than Hitler ever did, so I say I don't want to see the Apple sign, because to me it's offensive.
[00:37:58.644 --> 00:38:00.924]  But see, that's not going to happen.
[00:38:00.924 --> 00:38:02.825]  Plus, I don't want to get rid of symbols.
[00:38:02.825 --> 00:38:09.247]  They just want to be able to say whatever symbols they want are evil, and remove whatever they want, because they're at war with language.
[00:38:09.247 --> 00:38:17.289]  Because tyranny is something that isn't popular, and people don't want it, so they have to sabotage it.
[00:38:17.289 --> 00:38:19.049]  Let's go ahead and go back to Joe Biden.
[00:38:20.538 --> 00:38:26.215]  Carrying Nazi flights, chanting the same exact anti-Semitic bio.
[00:38:27.768 --> 00:38:29.389]  That was chanted in the streets of New York.
[00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:33.973]  And I forgot, all three of the leaders worked for Obama within one year, Hillary.
[00:38:33.973 --> 00:38:47.944]  And then they all suddenly went from being big university operators, with parents of the Democratic Party, some of them intelligence groups, to going out marching around with torches, dressed in 1930s outfits, so that people think Nazis are invading.
[00:38:47.944 --> 00:38:50.906]  And how many times has the Southern Property Law Center and ADL
[00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:53.929]  And others have been caught posing as Nazis.
[00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:55.049]  How many times?
[00:38:55.049 --> 00:39:06.518]  I got a stack of news where Muslims have been caught in the US and Canada this week staging attacks on themselves that they did.
[00:39:06.518 --> 00:39:08.579]  Let's go back to Joe Biden.
[00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:14.743]  In Berlin and every other German city in the 30s.
[00:39:14.743 --> 00:39:16.705]  It's serious guys, so hush up.
[00:39:18.527 --> 00:39:19.888]  This is deadly earnest.
[00:39:19.888 --> 00:39:21.168]  Yes, the Nazis were here.
[00:39:21.168 --> 00:39:24.549]  We are in a fight for America's soul.
[00:39:24.549 --> 00:39:39.336]  And we have leaders, we have leaders who at the time when that occurred, when these guys were accompanied by white supremacists in Ku Klux Klan and those who objected, making a comparison saying they're good people in both groups.
[00:39:39.336 --> 00:39:41.897]  What has become of us?
[00:39:41.897 --> 00:39:46.979]  Our children are listening and our silence is complicity.
[00:39:49.392 --> 00:39:53.796]  Our silence is complicity.
[00:39:53.796 --> 00:40:06.148]  You know, Trump got a briefing two hours from Charlottesville from Homeland Security who had agents there, and they said, sir, it was some reporters on both sides, some pro-peace people on one side, Antifa's bad, and then some Nazis on the other side that were bad.
[00:40:06.874 --> 00:40:13.356]  So Trump goes, well the Nazis were bad, so was the Antifa was bad, and there were good people on both sides as well.
[00:40:13.356 --> 00:40:15.916]  That was given to him in the briefing.
[00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:24.638]  You had a bunch of people out there to cover it, a bunch of peace people, a bunch of right-wing pro-free speech people, and then you had some Nazis and some Antifa.
[00:40:24.638 --> 00:40:26.759]  But yeah, I think we all agree are unsavory folks.
[00:40:28.868 --> 00:40:30.650]  That's how this works.
[00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.491]  Well, good job of the crew.
[00:40:31.491 --> 00:40:35.096]  They actually found the photo, remember that, of Trump being briefed on Charlottesville.
[00:40:35.096 --> 00:40:35.917]  He didn't know what it was.
[00:40:35.917 --> 00:40:38.280]  He went and said, what is this?
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.643]  They said, here it is, sir.
[00:40:40.643 --> 00:40:47.272]  So he went out there, but imagine in America, the Communist Chinese have killed a hundred plus million people.
[00:40:50.612 --> 00:40:51.132]  They've done that.
[00:40:51.132 --> 00:40:52.433]  They're their own people.
[00:40:52.433 --> 00:40:53.753]  Never a word about them.
[00:40:53.753 --> 00:40:57.675]  Never about Apple and slave factories and suicide nets.
[00:40:57.675 --> 00:40:59.636]  Never about Google helping round up political dissidents.
[00:40:59.636 --> 00:41:05.738]  It's all about America and Nazis and Charlottesville.
[00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:14.742]  The people with torches, all 20 of them, are coming to get you and you better do what Joe Biden says or the Nazis will get you.
[00:41:14.742 --> 00:41:19.084]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:36.411]  And really, what it was, was the art club from a couple local universities, with guys that get Southern Poverty Law Center money, just coming out in court, who just all dress up like Nazis to go scare the hell out of everybody, and go after Trump.
[00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:37.171]  That's what the left is.
[00:41:37.171 --> 00:41:38.132]  They're a drama club.
[00:41:38.837 --> 00:41:40.257]  They are thespians.
[00:41:40.257 --> 00:41:41.097]  They are actors.
[00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:42.378]  It's what they do.
[00:41:42.378 --> 00:41:46.339]  It's what they constantly get caught doing and they don't want us to know that.
[00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:56.281]  Anderson Cooper stood in water up to his chest in a ditch to say the houses were flooded when they weren't.
[00:41:56.281 --> 00:41:58.341]  The Weather Channel was being blown all over the place.
[00:41:58.341 --> 00:41:59.521]  People walked calmly behind him.
[00:41:59.521 --> 00:42:01.042]  It was fake.
[00:42:01.042 --> 00:42:02.962]  It's what they do.
[00:42:02.962 --> 00:42:05.643]  They are the fraud.
[00:42:05.643 --> 00:42:06.783]  And they don't want you
[00:42:08.115 --> 00:42:08.876]  Asking questions.
[00:42:08.876 --> 00:42:10.137]  They don't want you talking about it.
[00:42:10.137 --> 00:42:20.164]  They want to put out their fake info and have you go into suspended disbelief and have you believe that it's all real.
[00:42:20.164 --> 00:42:23.267]  But once somebody's awake to a scam, they never go back.
[00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:24.648]  And that's what they don't get.
[00:42:24.648 --> 00:42:27.010]  There is going to be a big giant red wave.
[00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:36.137]  The question is, will the seawall of the Democratic Party... Will the Democratic Party
[00:42:45.003 --> 00:42:50.354]  Be able to build a big enough wall to block that seawall with election fraud and the rest of it.
[00:42:50.354 --> 00:42:52.017]  I'm gonna keep fighting to the end regardless.
[00:42:52.017 --> 00:42:54.122]  I don't know if you are, but I sure as hell am.
[00:42:54.122 --> 00:42:54.723]  I'm conscious.
[00:42:54.723 --> 00:42:55.384]  I'm not dead yet.
[00:42:58.163 --> 00:43:02.126]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:43:02.126 --> 00:43:05.409]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:11.674]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:43:11.674 --> 00:43:14.456]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:43:15.177 --> 00:43:18.998]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:43:18.998 --> 00:43:25.480]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.442]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:43:31.198 --> 00:43:35.121]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:42.305]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:43:42.305 --> 00:43:47.008]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:43:47.008 --> 00:43:53.232]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:43:53.232 --> 00:43:57.195]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:43:58.334 --> 00:44:03.175]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:03.175 --> 00:44:12.637]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:12.637 --> 00:44:17.417]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:47:01.686 --> 00:47:04.327]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:25.150]  Alex Jones back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:33.533]  I want to get into what's happening right now with the attempt to confer Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
[00:47:50.185 --> 00:47:58.150]  And how they float this whole thing about 35 years ago in high school, he might have jumped on top of a girl at a drunk party.
[00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:04.194]  And now they've got the person going public.
[00:48:04.194 --> 00:48:10.798]  I have personally experienced mainstream media go out and offer people money to lie about me.
[00:48:15.004 --> 00:48:18.526]  And when you see it in print, you know how criminal these gribs are.
[00:48:18.526 --> 00:48:27.032]  And the fact that Democrats believe it's their duty to go out and make things up.
[00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:32.635]  When you see something like this, it doesn't hold any water.
[00:48:32.635 --> 00:48:40.040]  In fact, we're going to get to it here in just a moment, but it's amazing the length to which this stuff will happen.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.421]  And maybe this woman even believes it.
[00:48:42.571 --> 00:48:44.873]  We're gonna get to that here in just a moment.
[00:48:44.873 --> 00:48:57.322]  But first, it's important to understand that I'm not really worried about me being deplatformed off of 90 plus platforms now.
[00:48:57.322 --> 00:49:08.170]  I'm concerned because it's concerted and it's corporate, and it's being done to many, many other people in unison.
[00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:10.192]  And by them picking InfoWars out to do it,
[00:49:11.601 --> 00:49:38.638]  And building a straw man, it distracts from the fact that it is monopolistic, it is racketeering, it is very, very dangerous what's going on by any yardstick, and the addled, tepid, sluggish, sloth-like response by the Republicans is horrifying.
[00:49:38.638 --> 00:49:39.819]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:40.820]  We've got screenshots.
[00:49:42.076 --> 00:49:47.298]  And we've got IT people that gave us a report and I'll put it out tomorrow and it's an exclusive.
[00:49:47.298 --> 00:49:55.720]  But we actually had software that we used banned over the weekend.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.141]  And I've talked to lawyers about this.
[00:49:57.141 --> 00:50:01.302]  This is definitely illegal, definitely racketeering.
[00:50:01.302 --> 00:50:03.583]  I mean, it's it's unbelievable.
[00:50:06.363 --> 00:50:19.712]  And it deals with Apple and, you know, I'll try my best because there's a target fixation that goes on in warfare where you'll get fixated on your target and then not even pay attention to what's happening to you.
[00:50:19.712 --> 00:50:25.976]  The famous case is people flying aircraft, strafing, say a train or a truck, and they'll fly into the vehicle.
[00:50:25.976 --> 00:50:28.037]  They'll just keep and fly into it.
[00:50:29.502 --> 00:50:58.544]  And there's, we got a great crew here, they're great people, but it's kind of like, I learned about this on Friday, confirmed it with IT, it's the biggest story yet in our censorship, but see, just like the public's supposed to get conditioned to being censored and blacklisted and banned, by InfoWars being in tens of thousands of articles, they're supposed to wear us out psychologically, finally when they start doing stuff like killing the software we use,
[00:50:59.505 --> 00:51:01.226]  It's like, so what?
[00:51:01.226 --> 00:51:03.448]  Everybody knows we're getting banned.
[00:51:03.448 --> 00:51:03.888]  So what?
[00:51:03.888 --> 00:51:06.070]  They took Alex away and killed him too.
[00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:09.352]  You know, we knew it was coming.
[00:51:09.352 --> 00:51:11.614]  And it's just like that globalist told me that time off record.
[00:51:11.614 --> 00:51:17.799]  He's one of the heads of one of the big banks, one of the fourth largest bank at that time.
[00:51:17.799 --> 00:51:22.122]  He said, Alex, you're going to adapt to being a slave.
[00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:23.523]  People don't adapt to fighting it.
[00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:34.437]  And you know what?
[00:51:34.437 --> 00:51:38.959]  Maybe he's right.
[00:51:38.959 --> 00:51:45.301]  And then those of us that don't prey on you, we're the mentally ill ones.
[00:51:45.301 --> 00:51:52.664]  Because what the predators will tell you is, the general public are just failed predators.
[00:51:52.664 --> 00:51:54.765]  And if you help them, they'll just tear you apart.
[00:51:54.765 --> 00:51:55.705]  But you know what?
[00:51:55.705 --> 00:51:57.906]  My soul tells me that's wrong and I'm not going to act like that.
[00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:06.261]  It's very, very frustrating, to say the least.
[00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:13.446]  And what they're doing to us is so sick.
[00:52:13.446 --> 00:52:14.827]  All of it scientifically directed.
[00:52:21.124 --> 00:52:22.485]  So who knows?
[00:52:22.485 --> 00:52:24.847]  We may never even tell you.
[00:52:24.847 --> 00:52:26.208]  Hell, they might just shut us down.
[00:52:26.208 --> 00:52:27.409]  We won't even do an article.
[00:52:27.409 --> 00:52:28.330]  Hell, no one will.
[00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:33.655]  You know, by the time they actually shut us down, there won't even be a story.
[00:52:33.655 --> 00:52:35.476]  They'd take me out and shoot me in the back of the head.
[00:52:35.476 --> 00:52:40.500]  By then, it's like, that's old news.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:47.466]  They're going into people's phones and killing programs that came with the phones.
[00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:48.988]  So you can't visit InfoWars.com.
[00:52:57.756 --> 00:52:58.937]  But everybody's still got their food.
[00:52:58.937 --> 00:53:02.598]  Everybody still can go home and watch television, so who cares?
[00:53:02.598 --> 00:53:04.599]  Exactly.
[00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:05.860]  Exactly.
[00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.720]  And that's why we fail.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.721]  That's why we die.
[00:53:08.721 --> 00:53:18.365]  And I just watch us being incrementally enslaved, and I'm upset about it, and I'm supposed to see how that works and join it and farm you!
[00:53:18.365 --> 00:53:20.326]  I'm supposed to serve the globalists,
[00:53:22.048 --> 00:53:30.630]  So I get life extension technology, and I get cybernetic enhancement down the road, and I'm supposed to revel in how dumb you are.
[00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:31.310]  See?
[00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:35.171]  But instead, I get to be the bad guy because I'm trying to save you.
[00:53:35.171 --> 00:53:45.513]  Because I have some type of connection to you.
[00:53:45.513 --> 00:53:49.333]  It's beyond amazing.
[00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:51.634]  So people ask, you know, why is your broadcast banned?
[00:53:52.844 --> 00:53:54.565]  Why are they trying to ban it?
[00:53:54.565 --> 00:54:03.127]  Because of what we're covering, and because they're going to go ahead and make that move, and because they want to set the precedent.
[00:54:03.127 --> 00:54:03.687]  But I know this.
[00:54:03.687 --> 00:54:09.609]  I look at people that have decided to make these evil decisions, and they are the most unhappy, twisted, physically ugly people on earth.
[00:54:09.609 --> 00:54:15.351]  So let me tell you, metaphysically, culturally, and a gut level, I know not to join them.
[00:54:15.351 --> 00:54:19.412]  But the public needs to stand up for their own self-preservation.
[00:54:19.412 --> 00:54:21.153]  Now this is funny for radio listeners.
[00:54:22.858 --> 00:54:28.681]  But it's really funny if you're a TV viewer at Infowars.com forward slash show or on TV stations around the country.
[00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:38.305]  Because this is a piece that Drew and Savannah put together a month and a half ago when our app went to number one on Apple and on Android.
[00:54:38.305 --> 00:54:43.268]  And then after it went to number one, they just removed the Apple one that had two million downloads.
[00:54:43.268 --> 00:54:46.669]  The Android's still there at Infowars.com forward slash app.
[00:54:48.988 --> 00:54:59.116]  This is us making a joke out of what they did, but we knew the next move would be BlockInfoWars.com at the browser level.
[00:54:59.116 --> 00:55:03.679]  And that has now begun.
[00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:05.541]  And InfoWars will not be the one that breaks it.
[00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:07.562]  I'm going to let the enemy go ahead and do it now.
[00:55:07.562 --> 00:55:08.423]  No one cares around here.
[00:55:08.423 --> 00:55:09.143]  That's fine.
[00:55:09.143 --> 00:55:09.664]  I love it too.
[00:55:09.664 --> 00:55:09.904]  Great.
[00:55:09.904 --> 00:55:10.104]  Yeah.
[00:55:10.104 --> 00:55:11.605]  Close our doors.
[00:55:16.189 --> 00:55:18.011]  We'll let the enemy break it.
[00:55:18.011 --> 00:55:20.373]  And let's see how they... Oh, it's a private company.
[00:55:20.373 --> 00:55:26.098]  Oh, it's a... Oh, you bought that phone, so they're blocking visiting Infowars.com on an Apple phone.
[00:55:26.098 --> 00:55:28.500]  That's what they're doing now.
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:32.984]  And it's cute, and it's fun, and it's neat, and it's great.
[00:55:32.984 --> 00:55:34.765]  And so, here it is.
[00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:35.246]  Here's the quote.
[00:55:40.342 --> 00:55:45.853]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[00:55:45.853 --> 00:55:47.936]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[00:55:49.907 --> 00:55:59.255]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasting radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:59.255 --> 00:56:05.981]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[00:56:05.981 --> 00:56:11.225]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[00:56:11.225 --> 00:56:12.146]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:56:12.546 --> 00:56:14.127]  But I can tell you
[00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:43.231]  Millions download the app, then they take it out of the store.
[00:56:43.231 --> 00:56:46.492]  Congress does nothing, but that's so illegal.
[00:56:46.492 --> 00:56:49.793]  Next, they're going to go in and take the app off your phone.
[00:56:49.793 --> 00:56:53.654]  Next, they're going to block the InfoWars RSS feeder on Apple, which they've already done.
[00:56:53.654 --> 00:56:55.414]  That's the breaking news.
[00:56:55.414 --> 00:56:56.355]  And just everything else.
[00:56:56.355 --> 00:57:00.516]  And see, by the time they get to the real censorship, the real
[00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:07.852]  Extermination of freedom, it's just laissez-faire law.
[00:57:07.852 --> 00:57:11.473]  Because you've already gotten yourself ready to accept that.
[00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:15.414]  And so see, by the time you've done that, oh, it's like Think Progress is being banned.
[00:57:15.414 --> 00:57:17.275]  Well, okay, that's all right, too.
[00:57:17.275 --> 00:57:23.617]  You know, as long as the good old neocon boys over at the CIA do it.
[00:57:23.617 --> 00:57:27.338]  As long as, you know, because nobody reads the Weekly Standard, everybody hates them.
[00:57:27.338 --> 00:57:28.638]  So what's the power structure do?
[00:57:28.638 --> 00:57:30.519]  Oh, put them in charge of censoring the left.
[00:57:31.638 --> 00:57:35.902]  And the left won't defend the right, the right won't defend the left, and then it's game over.
[00:57:35.902 --> 00:57:37.584]  Well, that's not the truth.
[00:57:37.584 --> 00:57:45.152]  We're winning, big red waves coming, but folks have to really realize we're two minutes to midnight, and now is the time to get on your knees to Jesus.
[00:57:45.152 --> 00:57:46.353]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:57:48.243 --> 00:57:54.505]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[00:57:54.505 --> 00:57:58.867]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[00:57:58.867 --> 00:58:06.149]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.330]  Our super high quality nascent iodine,
[00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:14.794]  Is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra-pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[00:58:14.794 --> 00:58:22.558]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[00:58:22.558 --> 00:58:29.462]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[00:58:29.842 --> 00:58:36.886]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:36.886 --> 00:58:37.086]  It's you!
[00:58:58.228 --> 00:59:00.430]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:09.119]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:13.744]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:13.744 --> 00:59:15.185]  You are the info war.
[00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:18.709]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:30.773]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:30.773 --> 00:59:38.736]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:38.736 --> 00:59:45.779]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:45.779 --> 00:59:48.520]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning!
[00:59:52.620 --> 01:00:08.648]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:15.152]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:22.725]  So, about five months ago, the EU introduced legislation to ban memes.
[01:00:22.725 --> 01:00:24.366]  Seriously.
[01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:28.828]  Because their AI can't scan it, it doesn't get humor, so they can't censor it.
[01:00:28.828 --> 01:00:34.691]  And so they go, oh, it's copyright, it's got to be reviewed by the EU, or there's multi-million euro fines.
[01:00:34.691 --> 01:00:36.372]  And then now they passed it.
[01:00:36.372 --> 01:00:38.913]  So first the media said, oh, it'll never happen.
[01:00:38.913 --> 01:00:40.754]  Now, of course, it's happened.
[01:00:40.754 --> 01:00:42.035]  EU killing legislation.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.262]  Yeah, that is designed to destroy the Internet.
[01:00:47.262 --> 01:00:49.623]  Here is part of the report from John Bell.
[01:00:49.623 --> 01:00:57.369]  EU Parliament recently put the Internet, at least in Europe, on a path towards certain corporate Orwellian doom.
[01:00:57.369 --> 01:01:04.934]  This discussion is bedeviled by all sorts of artificial media twitstorms and hysteria of one kind or another.
[01:01:04.934 --> 01:01:09.837]  There's a very good argument against the lack of democracy in the EU.
[01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:10.958]  Isn't it funny?
[01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:12.259]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago,
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:21.182]  And I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union.
[01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:23.423]  You all laughed at me.
[01:01:23.423 --> 01:01:26.283]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:39.607]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe,
[01:01:41.033 --> 01:01:45.514]  You have imposed upon them a political union!
[01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:58.237]  Article 11, also known as the Link Tax, forces anyone linking an article of more than one word to a news story to pay for a service that licenses the article.
[01:01:58.237 --> 01:02:04.278]  That news site can, according to The Verge, charge anything they want for the right to quote them.
[01:02:04.838 --> 01:02:11.142]  ...or refuse to sell altogether, effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticize them.
[01:02:11.142 --> 01:02:31.114]  While Article 13, also known as the Upload Filter, requires all but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters that examine everything you post and censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement, according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:43.740]  And if that wasn't enough to bring the free flow of information to a grinding halt, typical social media posts like a selfie taken at a football game have been targeted by Article 12A.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.142]  No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches, only the
[01:02:48.562 --> 01:02:55.325]  Organizers of sports matches will have the right to publicly post any kind of record of the match.
[01:02:55.325 --> 01:02:59.866]  No posting your selfies or short videos of exciting plays.
[01:02:59.866 --> 01:03:01.447]  You are the audience.
[01:03:01.447 --> 01:03:04.268]  Your job is to sit where you're told.
[01:03:04.268 --> 01:03:06.989]  Passively watch the game and go home.
[01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:09.290]  According to the EFF.
[01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:13.653]  Also, a freedom of panorama exemption wasn't accepted.
[01:03:13.653 --> 01:03:29.322]  For example, if you take a selfie on a busy street and licensed material happens to be in your shot, whether it's a t-shirt, a licensed architectural design, aka a building or a billboard, you will be infringing on a copyright.
[01:03:29.322 --> 01:03:30.363]  Also not covered.
[01:03:30.883 --> 01:03:50.856]  Anything we regard in America as fair use, no user-generated content exemption, which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright for using excerpts from works for criticism, review, illustration, caricature, parody, or pastiche.
[01:03:50.856 --> 01:03:54.239]  EU army to increase ranks sevenfold.
[01:03:54.239 --> 01:03:59.943]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU army because it actually come out in documents.
[01:04:00.943 --> 01:04:03.604]  We've actually gotten documents from someone inside Bilderberg.
[01:04:03.604 --> 01:04:16.008]  They were discussing an EU army to stop countries from having their own borders and that they were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists just out of the Middle East.
[01:04:16.008 --> 01:04:16.808]  It's all true.
[01:04:16.808 --> 01:04:17.348]  It all happened.
[01:04:17.348 --> 01:04:19.289]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:25.891]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives brought me secret Bilderberg documents the next year confirming it all.
[01:04:25.891 --> 01:04:26.711]  We published them all.
[01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:29.509]  I did get death threats.
[01:04:29.509 --> 01:04:36.933]  Now, but Juncker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU, that England didn't vote to enter but they're in, the UK, he is the grandson.
[01:04:36.933 --> 01:04:38.914]  His father was a top Nazi.
[01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:41.616]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[01:04:41.616 --> 01:04:44.338]  Alright folks, we'll be back.
[01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:47.460]  The full John Bowden report is on Infowars.com.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.981]  EU internet killing legislation.
[01:04:48.981 --> 01:04:50.161]  It's really important.
[01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:53.924]  We'll be back with Eric Bolling confronted with 9-11 truths.
[01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:54.384]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.116 --> 01:05:04.578]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[01:05:04.578 --> 01:05:13.840]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:22.903]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as acid xanthan and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[01:05:23.857 --> 01:05:35.310]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:44.461]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:47.605]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[01:05:47.605 --> 01:05:51.270]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.393]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:06:17.637 --> 01:06:26.163]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had, formerly with Fox News, Eric Bolling, economist, good friends with Trump, now with CRTV, we had Eric Bolling in studio.
[01:06:26.163 --> 01:06:34.590]  And he was going to come on about the economy and about how Trump's ideology is making America great and standing up to big corporate bullies.
[01:06:35.586 --> 01:06:43.351]  Instead of the media saying he has no soul, but Boling wanted to virtue signal to the mainstream media and say, aren't you all right?
[01:06:43.351 --> 01:06:44.212]  They're racist.
[01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:46.554]  And I'm like, that's a Hillary Clinton talking point.
[01:06:46.554 --> 01:06:49.015]  And, oh, you think the government did 9-11?
[01:06:49.015 --> 01:06:54.219]  And I'm like, yeah, the 28 pages, criminal elements of our government, allied with Saudi Arabia, stood down.
[01:06:55.213 --> 01:06:56.534]  I've had Senator Paul on.
[01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:58.736]  I've had Congressman Jones on.
[01:06:58.736 --> 01:07:04.262]  I've had former Deputy Directors and former heads of CIOP of the CIA on.
[01:07:04.262 --> 01:07:06.664]  This is a well-known animal.
[01:07:06.664 --> 01:07:10.588]  Doesn't mean radical Islam doesn't exist.
[01:07:10.588 --> 01:07:13.932]  And he just was like, no, I can't believe it.
[01:07:13.932 --> 01:07:15.353]  You know, there were real people down there.
[01:07:15.353 --> 01:07:17.135]  Yeah, we know real people died.
[01:07:17.135 --> 01:07:18.136]  Real planes flew in.
[01:07:19.813 --> 01:07:31.183]  All I'm saying is, if you go look at the evidence of Building 7, or of BBC and CNN reporting they were going to blow up Building 7, 47-story building.
[01:07:31.183 --> 01:07:31.964]  That happened.
[01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:33.285]  Later they said it never happened.
[01:07:33.285 --> 01:07:36.788]  So the point is, it needs to be investigated.
[01:07:36.788 --> 01:07:41.272]  And it turns out, within days of the event, on three different shows, then
[01:07:43.288 --> 01:07:51.577]  Real estate mogul, now President Trump, said he thought there were bombs in the buildings, and his engineer, who helped build the World Trade Center, thought that.
[01:07:51.577 --> 01:07:54.800]  So, Bolling was here, and I would mention this.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.061]  He goes, oh, you don't have the clip.
[01:07:56.061 --> 01:07:58.143]  You know, I don't want to just hear it.
[01:07:58.143 --> 01:07:58.944]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:03.949]  Now we have the clips, and here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:05.170]  Here is the report.
[01:08:06.192 --> 01:08:10.415]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory that some crazy person made up.
[01:08:10.415 --> 01:08:13.098]  I said I do not agree with you that the U.S.
[01:08:13.098 --> 01:08:18.142]  government, someone inside the government, had knowledge of the terror attack prior to the attack.
[01:08:18.142 --> 01:08:18.742]  Oh really?
[01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:23.886]  All over Twitter yesterday, mainline leftist sites celebrated and said America deserved it.
[01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:27.629]  Reality winner had a top-secret security clearance and was helping ISIS.
[01:08:27.629 --> 01:08:30.892]  There are some, the average professor at UT down the street,
[01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:33.674]  He loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:38.639]  There were elements in our government allied with radical Islam that helped them carry out the attack!
[01:08:38.639 --> 01:08:44.063]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not, I don't think.
[01:08:44.063 --> 01:08:45.745]  I don't think America deserved it!
[01:08:45.745 --> 01:08:48.047]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it!
[01:08:48.047 --> 01:08:56.394]  Your theory, Alex, your theory was not only did America not deserve it, but the United States government knew about the attack prior to the attack and decided to stand down.
[01:08:56.394 --> 01:08:57.235]  A very different theory.
[01:08:57.495 --> 01:08:58.976]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[01:08:58.976 --> 01:09:00.777]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[01:09:00.777 --> 01:09:02.638]  It's that the media misrepresents what I say about it.
[01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:08.081]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam is one of the number one threats on the planet, probably number one.
[01:09:08.081 --> 01:09:13.504]  I know that there are criminals in our government, like Brennan, who reportedly converted to Wahhabism.
[01:09:13.504 --> 01:09:18.246]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring to overthrow our allies in Egypt, you name it.
[01:09:18.246 --> 01:09:21.128]  And I think that elements let this happen, like PNAC.
[01:09:21.768 --> 01:09:23.309]  I don't blame our military!
[01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:44.979]  Oh, you hate our military?
[01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:45.719]  No, I love our military.
[01:09:45.719 --> 01:09:52.261]  The Bin Laden family was whisked out of the United States by President Bush himself right after the 9-11 attack.
[01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:54.161]  And they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:54.841]  That's right.
[01:09:54.841 --> 01:10:05.743]  When you had the World Trade Center go, people were put into planes that were friends, family, girlfriends, and they were put into planes and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:09.184]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance with the left
[01:10:09.984 --> 01:10:13.206]  And there are people in the government working to protect Islam.
[01:10:13.206 --> 01:10:15.387]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[01:10:15.387 --> 01:10:20.029]  After six months, he's being released from British prison next week.
[01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:22.770]  You said some things that I agree with.
[01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:27.112]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[01:10:27.112 --> 01:10:28.232]  I'll agree with that.
[01:10:28.232 --> 01:10:29.193]  Maybe the left's bigger though.
[01:10:29.949 --> 01:10:39.153]  Well, I think the one on the left is a different type of threat, and it's a longer-term threat where, you know, radical Islam could, you know, kill a lot of people real fast.
[01:10:39.153 --> 01:10:42.835]  And the left, it's going to take a while for them to take over and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[01:10:42.835 --> 01:10:45.716]  But I think we can deal with a straight-on attack like radical Islam.
[01:10:45.716 --> 01:10:46.857]  It's the left creeping around.
[01:10:46.857 --> 01:10:48.157]  I don't like them either.
[01:10:48.157 --> 01:10:49.158]  I'm on board with that.
[01:10:49.158 --> 01:10:53.640]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying Building 7 has already fallen.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.200]  Have you seen that video?
[01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:56.707]  And it's right behind her.
[01:10:56.707 --> 01:10:57.868]  I can't hear her.
[01:10:57.868 --> 01:11:00.330]  Do you want me to play it for you?
[01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:02.391]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:08.774]  And by the way, Alex, anyone could throw a video of the picture behind it.
[01:11:08.774 --> 01:11:09.315]  The news person.
[01:11:09.315 --> 01:11:11.656]  That could be... Well, she's saying Building 7 has fallen.
[01:11:11.656 --> 01:11:13.037]  They put the story out beforehand.
[01:11:13.237 --> 01:11:16.619]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[01:11:16.619 --> 01:11:22.442]  You might have heard a few moments ago I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing, and indeed it has.
[01:11:22.442 --> 01:11:26.403]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:11:26.403 --> 01:11:28.424]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:11:28.424 --> 01:11:30.305]  The details are very, very sketchy.
[01:11:30.305 --> 01:11:39.590]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex, is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:42.672]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:11:42.672 --> 01:11:44.473]  It just pancaked.
[01:11:44.473 --> 01:11:49.796]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision implosion.
[01:11:49.796 --> 01:12:00.002]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:12:05.558 --> 01:12:16.125]  Donald Trump is on the line, and we know him as the man behind lots of real estate in Manhattan, and of course, Donald, I understand you were actually a witness to what happened this morning.
[01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:22.329]  Well, I have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center, and I saw this huge explosion.
[01:12:22.329 --> 01:12:26.732]  I was with a group of people, and I really couldn't even believe it.
[01:12:26.732 --> 01:12:31.235]  And even, I think, worse than that, for years, I've looked right directly at the building.
[01:12:31.235 --> 01:12:33.637]  I'd see the Empire State Building in the foreground, and
[01:12:34.065 --> 01:12:38.448]  The World Trade Center in the background, and now I'm looking at absolutely nothing.
[01:12:38.448 --> 01:12:38.988]  It's just gone.
[01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:42.450]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.472]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[01:12:44.472 --> 01:12:47.514]  Now the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[01:12:47.514 --> 01:12:50.495]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[01:12:50.495 --> 01:12:54.398]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[01:12:54.398 --> 01:13:00.882]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[01:13:00.882 --> 01:13:02.303]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[01:13:02.782 --> 01:13:06.447]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy eye beams.
[01:13:06.447 --> 01:13:11.413]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[01:13:11.413 --> 01:13:15.559]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:18.463]  I think you, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[01:13:19.173 --> 01:13:21.294]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[01:13:21.294 --> 01:13:29.980]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:38.746]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[01:13:38.746 --> 01:13:42.749]  Most buildings are built with the steelers on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:46.091]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have.
[01:13:46.815 --> 01:13:50.298]  And it was almost just like a can of soup.
[01:13:50.298 --> 01:13:53.060]  I just think that it was a plane with more than just fuel.
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:59.305]  I think it just seemed to me that to do that kind of destruction is even more than a big plane.
[01:13:59.305 --> 01:14:04.148]  Because you're talking about taking out steel, the heaviest caliber steel that was used on a building.
[01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:07.511]  These buildings were rock solid.
[01:14:07.511 --> 01:14:10.013]  So I said the exact same things back at the time.
[01:14:11.561 --> 01:14:14.363]  It was on local news there were bombs in the buildings.
[01:14:14.363 --> 01:14:19.288]  And then the media would say, Jones says the fire department blew it up.
[01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:21.229]  Or Jones says the military did.
[01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:23.491]  Never said that.
[01:14:23.491 --> 01:14:30.618]  I said, I saw the news, I heard the news, they said they blew it up.
[01:14:30.618 --> 01:14:36.223]  And then you had John O'Neill, the deputy head of the FBI, quit a month before 9-11.
[01:14:39.158 --> 01:14:42.560]  And he came out and said, we're going to let Al-Qaeda attack us.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.040]  Al-Qaeda has infiltrated our government.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:47.682]  And it's wrong what happened and we need to expose it.
[01:14:47.682 --> 01:14:48.842]  And then he died.
[01:14:48.842 --> 01:14:52.984]  His first day at work was 9-11 as the head of security at the World Trade Center.
[01:14:52.984 --> 01:14:55.906]  And I've got the footage of the local police saying, get back.
[01:14:55.906 --> 01:14:56.946]  They're going to blow it up.
[01:14:56.946 --> 01:14:58.607]  Doesn't mean the police are involved.
[01:14:58.607 --> 01:15:01.528]  I talked to cops that were there during the 10-second countdown.
[01:15:01.528 --> 01:15:02.449]  But I don't just have that.
[01:15:02.449 --> 01:15:07.151]  I found the cops who were on PBS getting the countdown for Building 7.
[01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:10.471]  And they blew up other buildings, too.
[01:15:10.471 --> 01:15:13.012]  And all the chaos, they're told, oh, we're going to protect these buildings.
[01:15:13.012 --> 01:15:16.033]  It takes days, if not weeks, to wire these buildings.
[01:15:16.033 --> 01:15:16.954]  Do I know what happened?
[01:15:16.954 --> 01:15:18.835]  No, I don't.
[01:15:18.835 --> 01:15:20.816]  Just like President Trump doesn't.
[01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:22.136]  I covered it.
[01:15:22.136 --> 01:15:22.957]  I was on air.
[01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:24.977]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:15:24.977 --> 01:15:27.318]  Now, Eric Bolling said, hey, show me the clips.
[01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:29.239]  Eric, we just showed you the clips.
[01:15:29.239 --> 01:15:32.741]  So, this is a live show, but later we'll cut this out, we'll archive it.
[01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:34.722]  TimFullWars.com and NewsWars.com.

[01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:40.627]  And we will send this out to Eric Bolling.
[01:15:40.627 --> 01:15:42.389]  But you aren't banned from YouTube.

[01:16:59.844 --> 01:17:05.568]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:17:05.568 --> 01:17:13.433]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:17:13.433 --> 01:17:16.595]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:17:16.775 --> 01:17:22.039]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[01:17:56.661 --> 01:18:00.244]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:18:00.244 --> 01:18:02.026]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:18:02.026 --> 01:18:13.295]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:23.263]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:23.263 --> 01:18:29.207]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:18:29.207 --> 01:18:34.310]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.932]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:18:36.932 --> 01:18:38.653]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:38.653 --> 01:18:43.477]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:18:43.717 --> 01:18:45.418]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.
[01:18:45.418 --> 01:18:46.538]  We're really, really proud of it.
[01:18:46.538 --> 01:18:48.659]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[01:19:16.617 --> 01:19:25.681]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.

[01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:46.001]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[01:19:46.001 --> 01:19:48.023]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:19:48.023 --> 01:19:51.327]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:19:51.327 --> 01:19:53.870]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:19:53.870 --> 01:20:00.156]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[01:20:00.156 --> 01:20:02.839]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.799 --> 01:20:13.506]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:13.506 --> 01:20:18.640]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:20:21.889 --> 01:20:26.390]  All right, Roger Stone rides a shotgun with his former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:28.871]  Mueller sharks circling him.
[01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:35.173]  Manafort agreeing to plea bargain, but not on Russiagate, on tax evasion 15 years ago.
[01:20:35.173 --> 01:20:38.394]  But everybody's ready to blow their brains out over here about Russiagate.
[01:20:38.394 --> 01:20:50.798]  The reason Roger's here is to get into Matt Drudge, who's got a smart political brain on his shoulders, warns of midterm bloodbath, Trump to lose 60 seats in the House like Obama did unless
[01:20:52.176 --> 01:20:55.897]  But he cryptically didn't say what UNLESS meant.
[01:20:55.897 --> 01:21:13.280]  And then, California professor, writer of controversial Brett Kavanaugh letter, speaks out about her allegation of sexual assault, never told anybody until 2012, and she just said a group of frat boys were drunk and jumped on top of me for a few seconds, in a bed.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:21.241]  I think a group of frat boys beat me up a couple times, but I just, he actually was Brett, in fact, I'm not a secret source, Brett Kavanaugh,
[01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:28.682]  In 1986, came to Dallas, Texas, and I was in high school, and he raped me.
[01:21:28.682 --> 01:21:30.263]  No, I'm serious.
[01:21:30.263 --> 01:21:35.687]  He came in the room, it was him, and he punched me right in the nose, and he raped me.
[01:21:35.687 --> 01:21:36.487]  And that's it!
[01:21:36.487 --> 01:21:37.708]  He can't be confirmed.
[01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:44.994]  In fact, he then opened up a black suitcase, and 14 Keebler elves came out.
[01:21:44.994 --> 01:21:46.715]  You're thinking, hey, they're not scary, they're little.
[01:21:46.715 --> 01:21:48.937]  But listen.
[01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:49.697]  They were dangerous.
[01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:51.619]  They tied me down like Lilliputians.
[01:21:52.813 --> 01:21:54.774]  And Gulliver's Travels.
[01:21:54.774 --> 01:22:00.055]  And they, they made me take DMT and PCP.
[01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:07.297]  And then, once I was doing that, Barack Obama flew in, like a little winged pig, and landed at the foot of my bed.
[01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:11.078]  No, I'm being sarcastic here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:11.078 --> 01:22:18.420]  I could say, secret source says that Hillary Clinton
[01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:22.016]  Tells the truth, and you know it was a lie.
[01:22:22.016 --> 01:22:24.279]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[01:22:24.279 --> 01:22:28.523]  At least Anita Hill worked for Clarence Thomas.
[01:22:28.523 --> 01:22:32.548]  But then all the witnesses of her throwing herself at him.
[01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:34.870]  And then it never happened.
[01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:39.575]  So, we're going to get into that with Roger before we end this segment as well, but Roger,
[01:22:40.532 --> 01:22:47.442]  The big enchilada first, Joe Biden, maybe we should queue up the first 20 seconds of that clip, says that Trump supporters are the dregs of society.
[01:22:47.442 --> 01:22:52.089]  So if deplorables hurt Hillary, this has got to hurt Joe Biden.
[01:22:54.116 --> 01:22:58.640]  Yeah, I mean, Joe Biden is the world's class example of elitism.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:06.206]  He lives in Greenville, Delaware, the wealthiest part of town, and he tries to pass himself off as just good old regular Joe.
[01:23:06.206 --> 01:23:13.292]  You know, this is a guy whose son, Hunter, got extraordinarily lucrative
[01:23:13.792 --> 01:23:24.457]  Business deals out of both Ukraine and China in the immediate aftermath of his visiting both countries with his vice presidential father.
[01:23:24.457 --> 01:23:26.878]  You want to talk about collusion?
[01:23:26.878 --> 01:23:35.142]  I mean, Joe Biden is a is is about as tone deaf as you can get, and this constant disparagement
[01:23:35.851 --> 01:23:50.824]  of Donald Trump supporters because they're working class people, because they didn't go to Harvard or Yale is really part and parcel of the elitism of the Democratic Party and people like Biden.
[01:23:50.824 --> 01:23:56.409]  More importantly, though, why he can't keep his hands off of children, I just don't understand.
[01:23:56.409 --> 01:24:01.093]  Well, there's hours of video, but that doesn't matter because Brett Kavanaugh raped me.
[01:24:01.093 --> 01:24:02.294]  Seriously, I'm going to put the headline out.
[01:24:02.294 --> 01:24:03.155]  Did you know he raped me?
[01:24:04.159 --> 01:24:10.680]  This whole thing, this is a woman looking for her Anita Hill moment.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.801]  You know, this is her 15 minutes.
[01:24:13.801 --> 01:24:17.861]  Joe Biden is really one creepy guy.
[01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:27.163]  It's interesting because when I was in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware last week, Joe trawls up and down Rehoboth Avenue looking for adoration.
[01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:28.963]  He wants people to adore him.
[01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:33.284]  He has in the back of his mind that he's a Kennedy, whereas in truth,
[01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:42.327]  Every single foreign policy issue he dealt with as chairman of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, he was wrong.
[01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:43.548]  No, no, he did a terrible job.
[01:24:43.548 --> 01:24:56.193]  But just getting back to this liberal professor had said that once at a party in high school, some drunk guys jumped on her for five seconds and then that was it.
[01:24:56.193 --> 01:24:58.253]  And then now she says it's Kavanaugh.
[01:24:58.253 --> 01:24:59.214]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:24:59.214 --> 01:25:00.854]  Kavanaugh raped me.
[01:25:04.085 --> 01:25:05.206]  It's about as credible.
[01:25:05.206 --> 01:25:08.528]  I mean, first of all, what evidence does this woman produce?
[01:25:08.528 --> 01:25:13.010]  Is there another witness to this alleged assault?
[01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:22.316]  This is a last-ditch desperation attempt to derail what is almost certainly going to be another conservative Supreme Court justice racked up by Donald Jacobs.
[01:25:22.316 --> 01:25:29.340]  I was about to say, I mean, this is the most classic thing ever, where you just get any leftist out of millions of people just to make something up.
[01:25:30.646 --> 01:25:35.130]  And then to get your husband to say, oh yeah, she told me about it six years ago and then it's a done deal.
[01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.972]  This is crazy.
[01:25:36.972 --> 01:25:41.617]  Well, and the performance of Cory Booker really takes the cake.
[01:25:41.617 --> 01:25:42.858]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:25:42.858 --> 01:25:45.821]  I was working on a book on Cory Booker called The Moth.
[01:25:47.098 --> 01:25:58.344]  That's a name given to him by Governor Chris Christie because, like a moth, he flies to every controversy with a press release, but he never actually does anything.
[01:25:58.344 --> 01:26:07.189]  Cory Booker is an incredibly corrupt public servant, and I have a book coming out shortly on Cory Booker that will expose all of that.
[01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:13.613]  I was ready to leave him alone because he's a non-entity and he's not going to be president, but now I think I have no choice.
[01:26:13.993 --> 01:26:16.275]  Well, let's get to that last point, though.
[01:26:16.275 --> 01:26:19.538]  What do you make of Drudge saying we could lose 60 seats?
[01:26:19.538 --> 01:26:28.945]  Well, just because the polls showed Obama at the same point two years in as Trump, those are fake polls, plus there's the Trump secret that a lot of folks don't want to admit they support Trump.
[01:26:28.945 --> 01:26:31.087]  Now they have the illegal and the dead people voting.
[01:26:31.087 --> 01:26:32.188]  That's their secret.
[01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:36.392]  So that's why we still have a chance of losing, but only because of election fraud.
[01:26:36.392 --> 01:26:39.134]  Well, I gotta tell you, Alex, I'm more with
[01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:45.043]  With Matt Drudge on this, including, importantly, the word unless.
[01:26:45.043 --> 01:26:48.806]  The President has not framed this election.
[01:26:48.806 --> 01:26:53.790]  He's too busy dickering with the New York Times over their phony anonymous op-ed.
[01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:56.132]  He's too busy fighting over- No, I agree.
[01:26:56.132 --> 01:26:58.374]  He needs to stop giving their distractions attention.
[01:26:58.374 --> 01:26:59.735]  So what is the unless?
[01:26:59.735 --> 01:27:01.337]  What does President Trump need to do
[01:27:01.997 --> 01:27:04.121]  Right now he needs to say they're trying to overturn the election.
[01:27:04.121 --> 01:27:05.664]  They're trying to kill the recovery.
[01:27:05.664 --> 01:27:07.387]  They're the ones in league with the Russians and others.
[01:27:07.387 --> 01:27:09.451]  They're allied with radical Islam.
[01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:10.333]  They're the frauds.
[01:27:10.333 --> 01:27:14.019]  He needs to get on the super offense and stir Republicans up and do the same.
[01:27:14.019 --> 01:27:14.180]  Right?
[01:27:15.325 --> 01:27:21.126]  Declassify all of the information pertaining to the FISA warrant.
[01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:28.008]  The way to counter the phony Russian collusion fraud is to show who was cheating in 2016.
[01:27:28.008 --> 01:27:30.868]  It wasn't Donald Trump and the Republicans.
[01:27:30.868 --> 01:27:34.909]  It was Hillary Clinton and the Obama Justice Department and FBI.
[01:27:34.909 --> 01:27:42.391]  Mr. President, we implore you, declassify the information pertaining to the FISA warrants.
[01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:48.793]  When your advisors say, we can't do that sir, it's a matter of national security, that's a lie.
[01:27:48.793 --> 01:27:50.654]  A damnable lie.
[01:27:50.654 --> 01:27:57.857]  Well the matter of national security is not letting this rogue group of angry Democrats overturn the election of the American people and kill our recovery.
[01:27:57.857 --> 01:28:00.098]  He's got to release it now, they're not going to stop.
[01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.250]  Right.
[01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:02.771]  Two messages for the election.
[01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:06.073]  One, talk about the economic recovery and how great it is.
[01:28:06.073 --> 01:28:10.516]  Because the mainstream media will not talk about that, even though I think people are feeling it.
[01:28:10.516 --> 01:28:20.523]  And two, get the Democrats on defense by declassifying all of the information pertaining to the spying on Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:28:20.523 --> 01:28:22.964]  Yeah, he says he won't fire Sessions until after the election.
[01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:23.705]  I think that's a mistake.
[01:28:24.844 --> 01:28:26.985]  Well, I agree, but we're probably past that now.
[01:28:26.985 --> 01:28:35.711]  So, tout the economy and declassify the spying information and you will change the whole scope of this election.
[01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:38.533]  And the other unless is this, Roger.
[01:28:38.533 --> 01:28:39.954]  All of us gotta get people to vote.
[01:28:39.954 --> 01:28:41.175]  We gotta be politically active.
[01:28:41.175 --> 01:28:51.422]  We can't be asleep thinking this thing is won because they got a bunch of dead people and a bunch of illegal aliens set to vote and major election fraud with half the machines owned by George Soros.
[01:28:51.422 --> 01:28:52.583]  Newswars.com.
[01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:53.623]  Tomorrow's news today.

[01:29:56.897 --> 01:30:01.020]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:08.086]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[01:30:08.086 --> 01:30:12.910]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:21.337]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide water filtration
[01:30:23.339 --> 01:30:35.832]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[01:30:35.832 --> 01:30:42.920]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.

[01:30:58.379 --> 01:31:03.100]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was and how much we were buying.
[01:31:03.100 --> 01:31:06.200]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.201]  And so I've broken my contract.
[01:31:08.201 --> 01:31:12.902]  And right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[01:31:12.902 --> 01:31:18.403]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[01:31:18.403 --> 01:31:20.583]  Like I dream of Jeannie and there's this purple gas.
[01:31:20.583 --> 01:31:23.904]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[01:31:23.904 --> 01:31:25.864]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[01:31:26.924 --> 01:31:31.986]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:33.686]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[01:31:33.686 --> 01:31:34.907]  I'm breaking the contract.
[01:31:34.907 --> 01:31:39.168]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[01:31:39.168 --> 01:31:44.369]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[01:31:44.369 --> 01:31:46.310]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[01:31:46.310 --> 01:31:48.971]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:48.971 --> 01:31:50.771]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:52.192]  I suggest you stop up on it.
[01:31:52.192 --> 01:31:53.532]  It's available right now for a limited time.
[01:31:53.532 --> 01:31:54.893]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:54.893 --> 01:31:56.293]  It's 25% off right now.
[01:31:59.225 --> 01:32:08.648]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:20.051]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:25.713]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:11.306]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.306 --> 01:33:22.211]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:33:22.211 --> 01:33:23.892]  It's Roger Stone.
[01:33:26.554 --> 01:33:27.894]  Welcome back.
[01:33:27.894 --> 01:33:33.597]  You're on the Alex Jones Show and our very special Sunday night broadcast.
[01:33:33.597 --> 01:33:42.501]  With so much news breaking in Washington, these late evening reports from InfoWars are really indispensable.
[01:33:42.501 --> 01:33:47.704]  But people need to understand that InfoWars is threatened as never before.
[01:33:48.405 --> 01:33:56.870]  There's a veritable war of censorship being waged against Alex Jones and the entire team here at InfoWars.
[01:33:56.870 --> 01:34:02.834]  You see, this is the precursor to an effort to take Donald Trump down.
[01:34:02.834 --> 01:34:15.042]  We saw the seeds of it in the phony but serious New York Times editorial where they talked about a 25th amendment play to remove the president.
[01:34:15.746 --> 01:34:22.650]  If you've been following InfoWars, you know that we've been reporting about this literally for eight months.
[01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:36.819]  The 25th Amendment is a constitutional amendment that requires that if the vice president and a majority of the president's chosen cabinet seek to remove him, well, he has two choices.
[01:34:37.399 --> 01:34:42.781]  He can then go quietly, or he can appeal that decision to the U.S.
[01:34:42.781 --> 01:34:48.123]  House of Representatives, currently under control of Paul Ryan.
[01:34:48.123 --> 01:34:54.586]  The point, of course, is that we at InfoWars are bringing you this story, and no one else is.
[01:34:54.586 --> 01:35:00.528]  That's why we need your loyal support at the InfoWars.com store right now.
[01:35:01.509 --> 01:35:06.593]  One of my very favorite products is on sale, and that's X2.
[01:35:06.593 --> 01:35:13.037]  This is the best natural iodine formula that you can buy.
[01:35:13.037 --> 01:35:27.006]  Now, there's a big difference between Survival Shield X2 and the other iodine products that you can buy at, say, Whole Foods or even CVS or Fresh Market, and that is this.
[01:35:27.646 --> 01:35:38.289]  Alex Jones goes to enormous lengths and expense to get the very best natural nascent iodine on the face of the planet.
[01:35:38.289 --> 01:35:41.590]  And we have a more gentle price.
[01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:42.750]  What was normally $39.95 is $29.95.
[01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:44.610]  I was in Whole Foods yesterday.
[01:35:44.610 --> 01:35:45.011]  You'll pay $42.
[01:35:50.752 --> 01:35:59.958]  For their inferior iodine product and volume wise you actually get more by buying at Infowars.
[01:35:59.958 --> 01:36:13.267]  Nascent iodine is absolutely necessary to torque up your defenses, your immune system has been used all the way back to the Egyptians for this purpose.
[01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:18.591]  So by going to the Infowars.com site now and taking advantage of
[01:36:19.051 --> 01:36:28.954]  This particular product and when teamed with other great products, stacking as we call it, it's a 360 win!
[01:36:28.954 --> 01:36:46.120]  You're getting in the BioTrue Selenium Survival Shield Survival Pack, not only the best nascent iodine and selenium together, which help for healthy thyroid and overall beneficial to your well-being and health,
[01:36:46.778 --> 01:36:54.120]  You're helping us fund the fight against the globalist censors who would shut us down.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:37:03.442]  People don't understand the enormous expense of these harassment lawsuits that have been filed against Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:37:03.442 --> 01:37:06.643]  Oh, Alex Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[01:37:07.478 --> 01:37:08.419]  No, he didn't.
[01:37:08.419 --> 01:37:09.840]  That's not what he said.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:14.243]  And anybody who could look at the actual broadcast would know that.
[01:37:14.243 --> 01:37:24.251]  But lo and behold, the tech left, the Facebooks, the Twitters, the YouTubes, they've removed them so they can't even be examined.
[01:37:24.251 --> 01:37:29.595]  Which means Alex Jones is not afforded the opportunity to defend himself with truth.
[01:37:30.672 --> 01:37:36.335]  That's why we need you to go now to the InfoWars.com site and give us your support.
[01:37:36.335 --> 01:37:37.756]  We're not crying wolf.
[01:37:37.756 --> 01:37:41.999]  We're not just churning to sell product.
[01:37:41.999 --> 01:37:45.101]  We are up against it as never before.
[01:37:45.101 --> 01:37:48.383]  While you're there, two products I highly recommend.
[01:37:48.383 --> 01:37:52.125]  One, Brain Force Plus, one of my personal favorites.
[01:37:52.705 --> 01:37:55.267]  On special now for $29.95.
[01:37:55.267 --> 01:37:57.688]  That's a $10 reduction.
[01:37:57.688 --> 01:38:01.149]  Almost 6,000 satisfied testimonials.
[01:38:01.149 --> 01:38:03.931]  I popped a couple of these an hour ago.
[01:38:03.931 --> 01:38:14.816]  That's why I can do this show while working all day trying to finalize what will be an exciting product available on the InfoWars.com store shortly.
[01:38:14.816 --> 01:38:16.057]  Let me talk about that.
[01:38:16.897 --> 01:38:21.641]  Donald Trump has had an incoming assault from Bob Woodward.
[01:38:21.641 --> 01:38:27.405]  Now, if you believe the mainstream media, Bob Woodward is the second coming of Christ.
[01:38:27.405 --> 01:38:29.347]  This man never makes a mistake.
[01:38:29.347 --> 01:38:31.569]  He's a crusading journalist.
[01:38:31.569 --> 01:38:37.814]  He is the voice of reason and truth, along with his Sancho Panza, Karl Bernstein.
[01:38:38.394 --> 01:38:41.899]  This is the dynamic duo of duplicity.
[01:38:41.899 --> 01:38:52.593]  In my book, along with Tyler Nixon, Woodward and Bernstein, the godfathers of fake news, breaks down their long history of lies and fraud.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:53.981]  That's right.
[01:38:53.981 --> 01:39:00.506]  This book will be available on the Infowars.com store and elsewhere in the next 24 hours.
[01:39:00.506 --> 01:39:03.809]  We've kept it under wraps, but this I can tell you.
[01:39:03.809 --> 01:39:06.551]  Woodward lies about Watergate.
[01:39:06.551 --> 01:39:13.938]  Woodward lies about his personal background as a naval intelligence briefer for the Nixon White House.
[01:39:13.938 --> 01:39:15.059]  Who says so?
[01:39:15.059 --> 01:39:18.682]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Thomas Morem.
[01:39:19.502 --> 01:39:20.623]  Who else says so?
[01:39:20.623 --> 01:39:24.365]  The Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird.
[01:39:24.365 --> 01:39:25.685]  But it gets worse.
[01:39:25.685 --> 01:39:46.896]  Woodward lied about Iran-Contra, claiming that he surreptitiously slipped into the hospital room of former CIA Director Bill Casey after Casey had been felled by a stroke, and that Casey confessed everything, and that Casey spoke of his disdain for Ronald Reagan.
[01:39:46.896 --> 01:39:47.756]  I knew Bill Casey.
[01:39:52.689 --> 01:39:56.990]  And revered him as one of our greatest outsider presidents.
[01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:58.511]  But here's the real rub.
[01:39:58.511 --> 01:40:11.014]  Not only does hospital security and military security tell us that Woodward never gained access to Casey's room, but Casey, because of his stroke, had lost the capacity for speech.
[01:40:11.714 --> 01:40:24.441]  And therefore it was impossible for Casey to tell Woodward this alleged exclusive interview in which he confessed all of Iran-Contra.
[01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:28.664]  And then there's the John Belushi controversy.
[01:40:28.664 --> 01:40:32.186]  Woodward wrote a book about the beloved comedian John Belushi.
[01:40:32.953 --> 01:40:50.611]  My favorite part of our upcoming book is when Al Franken, yes, that Al Franken, sees that Bob Woodward is in Saturday Night Live producer Michael Lorne's, Lorne Michaels' office, digging on dirt on John Belushi.
[01:40:51.300 --> 01:41:00.564]  Franken strolls in and says to both of them, yeah, the only time I ever saw Belushi snorting coke, he's with Carl Bernstein.
[01:41:00.564 --> 01:41:07.908]  That's the kind of truth you're going to get from our new book, Woodward and Bernstein, The Godfathers of Fake News.
[01:41:07.908 --> 01:41:10.109]  And there's so much more.
[01:41:10.109 --> 01:41:16.492]  Numerous members of the Washington Post staff saying there was no deep throat.
[01:41:16.492 --> 01:41:20.434]  It's a confection, a fraud, a made up source.
[01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:28.552]  So the establishment icons, Woodward and Bernstein, are about to be
[01:41:29.867 --> 01:41:31.968]  Shall I say exposed.
[01:41:31.968 --> 01:41:35.411]  And you'll get it first here at InfoWars.
[01:41:35.411 --> 01:41:56.324]  In the meantime, to make sure that we can continue expanding, continue fighting, continue our fight for truth and to expose not only the truth about 9-11, but the truth about the assault on Donald Trump, for which they are trying so desperately to censor us, go to the InfoWars.com store now.

[01:42:57.327 --> 01:42:58.768]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:42:58.768 --> 01:43:12.031]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:43:12.031 --> 01:43:23.075]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:43:23.075 --> 01:43:23.975]  Go to InfoWars.com,
[01:43:24.775 --> 01:43:25.175]  I think so.
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.102]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[01:43:49.102 --> 01:43:54.205]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[01:43:54.205 --> 01:43:56.066]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[01:43:56.066 --> 01:44:05.572]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.

[01:44:56.761 --> 01:45:00.343]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:00.343 --> 01:45:02.123]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:02.123 --> 01:45:14.189]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:19.191]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:45:19.971 --> 01:45:29.313]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:29.313 --> 01:45:34.415]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:34.415 --> 01:45:37.035]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:45:37.035 --> 01:45:38.756]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:38.756 --> 01:45:43.557]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:45:43.797 --> 01:45:48.740]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:51.382]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:51.382 --> 01:45:57.366]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[01:47:00.105 --> 01:47:02.746]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.162 --> 01:47:16.504]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:16.504 --> 01:47:21.007]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:21.007 --> 01:47:27.030]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:28.651]  Welcome back.
[01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:34.854]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[01:47:35.896 --> 01:47:46.226]  In the last segment, we talked about Bob Woodward and his partner Carl Bernstein, but our focus was on the lies of Woodward.
[01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:58.818]  Lying about Watergate, lying about Deep Throat, who doesn't really exist, other than as a composite of sources, lying about Iran-Contra, lying about President Ronald Reagan,
[01:47:59.318 --> 01:48:06.006]  Lying about former CIA director, Bill Casey, the last real patriot to hold that job.
[01:48:06.006 --> 01:48:11.453]  Lying about the comedian, John Belushi, and now lying about President Donald Trump.
[01:48:12.139 --> 01:48:15.121]  But what of his partner, Carl Bernstein?
[01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:19.524]  Well, Carl Bernstein stepped in it only last week.
[01:48:19.524 --> 01:48:42.039]  You see, Bernstein went forward with a breathless report on CNN saying that Michael Cohen, the former attorney for Donald Trump, would testify to federal prosecutors, including presumably Robert Mueller, that President Donald Trump knew in advance about the controversial Trump Tower
[01:48:42.039 --> 01:48:42.344]  We're good.
[01:48:45.916 --> 01:48:59.944]  Well, we now know that that meeting was A, not illegal, and B, more likely a set-up, because the lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.
[01:48:59.944 --> 01:49:11.970]  was briefed both before and after the meeting by officials from Fusion GPS, and we still don't know for a certainty what kind of visa
[01:49:13.032 --> 01:49:17.335]  The woman Russian lawyer got into the country on.
[01:49:17.335 --> 01:49:31.843]  Now, it quickly became clear when Bernstein reported this story and said that the lady Davis, the attorney for the Clintons, now representing Cohn, was not his source.
[01:49:31.843 --> 01:49:38.887]  Davis undercut him by saying, A, he was the source and B, he was mistaken.
[01:49:39.691 --> 01:49:40.832]  Fair enough.
[01:49:40.832 --> 01:49:48.119]  You would think that a real journalist would then go to the air and apologize and retract and correct.
[01:49:48.119 --> 01:49:54.525]  Well, that's the difference between CNN and Carl Bernstein and we here at InfoWars.
[01:49:54.525 --> 01:49:55.426]  Case in point.
[01:49:56.136 --> 01:50:06.183]  I reported almost 10 days ago, incorrectly as it turns out, that Robert Mueller was seeking to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:11.566]  for lying to the FBI about the Trump Tower meeting.
[01:50:11.566 --> 01:50:16.550]  I now know and want to report that that report was incorrect.
[01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:25.196]  That in fact, the FBI, contrary to what my two sources told me, have not interviewed Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:25.196 --> 01:50:25.696]  However,
[01:50:26.337 --> 01:50:27.938]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:27.938 --> 01:50:31.058]  is in Mr. Mueller's crosshairs.
[01:50:31.058 --> 01:50:52.445]  Not for anything relating, as far as we know, to the Trump Tower meeting, but because the payments to Michael Cohen to reimburse Michael Cohen from Donald Trump's personal trust fund had to be signed off by a second executive who was an executor of that fund.
[01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:55.706]  That is likely to be Donald Trump Jr.
[01:50:56.776 --> 01:51:13.568]  I don't believe there's anything illegal or improper because the payment to Cohn, if it was indeed a reimbursement and a political expenditure, would mean that the president is allowed to contribute to his own campaign without limitation.
[01:51:13.568 --> 01:51:19.893]  Consequently, this would be, at a minimum, a crime of failure to report a contribution.
[01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:22.734]  Usually a $1,000 fine.
[01:51:22.734 --> 01:51:26.716]  So, my apologies to Donald Trump Jr.
[01:51:26.716 --> 01:51:28.596]  I was incorrect.
[01:51:28.596 --> 01:51:36.539]  It doesn't mean that he's not in the special counsel's crosshairs, but he's not in the crosshairs for lying to the FBI.
[01:51:36.539 --> 01:51:38.000]  My sources were incorrect.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.401]  I have now corrected it.
[01:51:40.401 --> 01:51:44.082]  That's the difference between Infowars and CNN.
[01:51:44.082 --> 01:51:49.824]  When we make an honest mistake based on our research, we come forward and tell you.
[01:51:49.824 --> 01:52:07.590]  So we've issued a retraction and an apology while still stressing that Donald Trump Jr., a great patriot, a good man in my opinion, reminds me of the old Donald Trump when he was a candidate, is still very much in Mr. Mueller's crosshairs.
[01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:11.772]  I wanted to get that off my chest because it's important.
[01:52:11.772 --> 01:52:14.334]  Truth and accuracy is important.
[01:52:14.334 --> 01:52:17.075]  That's what you get here at InfoWars.
[01:52:17.075 --> 01:52:19.136]  But make no mistake about it.
[01:52:19.136 --> 01:52:26.880]  When Donald Trump came out last week and said that it was necessary to take a close look,
[01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:44.888]  At the tech giants who have, without any dispute, been limiting the voices of conservatives and Republicans and Trump supporters using Alex Jones as the test case, he hit it right on the head.
[01:52:46.650 --> 01:53:06.685]  Believe me, if Alex Jones had not raised hell, had not brought this issue to the public consciousness, the president would never have done that fateful Google search in which he figured out, to his surprise, that the top 10 stories about Donald Trump were uniformly negative.
[01:53:06.685 --> 01:53:11.068]  This is the greatest single challenge the movement
[01:53:11.667 --> 01:53:12.727]  Faces.
[01:53:12.727 --> 01:53:24.252]  Donald Trump could not possibly have won the 2016 election without a robust, vibrant alternative media.
[01:53:24.252 --> 01:53:28.654]  And let's face it, Donald Trump plays Twitter like a fiddle.
[01:53:28.654 --> 01:53:39.318]  The more the left foams and says he needs to stop tweeting, the more I'm delighted and I enjoy every one of his entirely unfiltered tweets.
[01:53:39.318 --> 01:53:40.659]  But we need to be clear.
[01:53:41.633 --> 01:54:02.385]  If the left's campaign of censorship, if their efforts to strangle the First Amendment rights, first of Alex Jones, but then of everybody who questions the mainstream media narrative of lies, is successful, there will be no chances of victory in the 2018 election.
[01:54:02.385 --> 01:54:05.407]  There will be no chances of victory in the 2020 election.
[01:54:07.606 --> 01:54:12.190]  This is the single most important fight before us.
[01:54:12.190 --> 01:54:22.338]  You can argue about tax issues or immigration issues or trade issues, all of the other vital issues that face the country.
[01:54:22.338 --> 01:54:29.064]  But if we have no voice, if our voice is removed, then there is zero chance of victory.
[01:54:30.091 --> 01:54:38.195]  The one patriot who has had no lack of courage in talking about this issue is our friend Tucker Carlson.
[01:54:38.195 --> 01:54:40.376]  Tucker Carlson's had quite a week.
[01:54:40.376 --> 01:54:56.023]  First of all, tangling with Mike Avenatti, the dirty tricks porno lawyer, and then taking it to Jeff Toobin, the CNN legal analyst who every other word out of his mouth is racism, racist, racism.
[01:54:56.670 --> 01:54:57.790]  What a joke.
[01:54:57.790 --> 01:55:06.372]  So here's a shout out to Tucker Carlson because he's been unafraid to talk about the censorship of InfoWars.
[01:55:06.372 --> 01:55:07.492]  Why?
[01:55:07.492 --> 01:55:12.293]  Because Tucker Carlson understands it's a slippery slope.
[01:55:12.293 --> 01:55:22.695]  That if it's Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer and David Knight today, who will it be tomorrow?
[01:55:22.695 --> 01:55:23.495]  Tucker Carlson?
[01:55:24.139 --> 01:55:25.620]  Rush Limbaugh?
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:27.140]  Sean Hannity?
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:28.801]  Laura Ingram?
[01:55:28.801 --> 01:55:30.281]  Mark Simone?
[01:55:30.281 --> 01:55:31.922]  Mike Savage?
[01:55:31.922 --> 01:55:33.882]  These are the people that I admire.
[01:55:33.882 --> 01:55:36.683]  The people who bring you truth every day.
[01:55:36.683 --> 01:55:40.965]  Will the next person censored be Mark Levin, the great one?
[01:55:40.965 --> 01:55:43.046]  Believe me, it's a slippery slope.
[01:55:43.046 --> 01:55:52.109]  That's why I ask you again, before the end of this broadcast, please go to the InfoWars.com site and look at our terrific line of products.
[01:55:52.825 --> 01:56:03.268]  People don't seem to understand that what gives InfoWars and Alex Jones the independence to bring you the stone cold truth as it were.
[01:56:03.268 --> 01:56:11.510]  To tell it to you straight from the shoulder without any varnish is the fact that we rely only on our own products.

[01:57:05.878 --> 01:57:16.063]  It will sound like our products, but you'll get less of them and the actual ingredients will be substandard compared to what we use here at InfoWars.
[01:57:16.063 --> 01:57:17.784]  This is our lifeblood.
[01:57:17.784 --> 01:57:19.685]  This is what keeps us moving forward.
