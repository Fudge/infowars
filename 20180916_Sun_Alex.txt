[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  music
[00:30.000 --> 00:41.720]  It's now only 50 days, 50 days out from what undoubtedly would be the most historic election
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.640]  in the world of history.
[00:43.640 --> 00:46.720]  Getting Trump in was only the fluke, it was only the beachhead.
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.480]  You see, the globalist hope it was a fluke.
[00:49.480 --> 00:51.080]  It really wasn't.
[00:51.080 --> 00:54.680]  Populism and nationalism is exploding across the globe as we speak.
[00:54.680 --> 00:59.600]  Thanks for joining us on this live Sunday, the 16th day already of September.
[00:59.600 --> 01:03.560]  2018, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03.560 --> 01:09.600]  And let's get batten down here, batten down the hatches because we'll have the latest
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.200]  hurricane news as it day loses the Carolinas in record floods, obviously.
[01:15.200 --> 01:20.840]  But the big flood is the diarrhea of the mouth coming out of the reanimated corpse, the perfect
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.040]  rotting edifice of the corrupt Democratic Party.
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.760]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society.
[01:29.760 --> 01:32.920]  The video is up on infowars.com, but then it gets better.
[01:32.920 --> 01:34.420]  Oh, it gets better.
[01:34.420 --> 01:38.640]  He talks about the men in white hoods with torches are coming.
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.080]  He's talking about the Democratic Party.
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.280]  And the Republicans want to have the KKK enslave black people.
[01:46.280 --> 01:51.280]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.880]  But this is the guy they have planned to run against Trump in two years.
[01:54.880 --> 02:04.040]  I mean, look, Joe Biden looks like a dead body that Frankenstein electrocuted and that
[02:04.040 --> 02:06.560]  stood back up on its hind legs.
[02:06.560 --> 02:11.400]  It's where we playing all of this coming up today and a lot more.
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.040]  Our favorite socialist dingbat, which he's not caught out wearing $3,600 outfits, since
[02:18.040 --> 02:23.960]  he wants $40 trillion of free stuff for the American people, even though the entire global
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.000]  elite themselves don't even have $10 trillion.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.200]  They're the ones, by the way, backing her.
[02:29.200 --> 02:34.680]  But when she was confronted, even by liberals that, well, there's only, you know, $2 trillion
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.720]  out there, discretionary money, she just said, well, I don't care what you say, we're going
[02:39.720 --> 02:40.960]  to do it anyway.
[02:40.960 --> 02:42.560]  So that's amazing video.
[02:42.560 --> 02:46.120]  But let's get to this first piece and I'll play the larger piece when we come back from
[02:46.120 --> 02:47.120]  break.
[02:47.120 --> 02:53.920]  This is Joe Biden jumping the shark going further than saying just that Trump supporters
[02:53.920 --> 02:54.920]  are deplorable.
[02:54.920 --> 02:56.280]  No, no, no, no.
[02:56.280 --> 03:00.320]  He says Trump supporters are the dregs of society.
[03:00.320 --> 03:05.320]  Have you looked in the mirror at the poor sad saps conned by the Democrats?
[03:05.320 --> 03:10.840]  I mean, they are the dregs and then the scum of society, the worst, the count Dracula's
[03:10.840 --> 03:15.240]  of society are ruling over this throng of pathetic slaves.
[03:15.240 --> 03:22.720]  Here he is despite losing in the courts and in the court of public opinion, these forces
[03:22.720 --> 03:29.600]  of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you all have made.
[03:29.600 --> 03:35.240]  This time they, not you, have an ally in the White House.
[03:35.240 --> 03:37.360]  This time they have an ally.
[03:37.360 --> 03:44.040]  There are small percentage of the American people, virulent people, some of them the dregs
[03:44.040 --> 03:46.160]  of society.
[03:46.160 --> 03:52.920]  And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity,
[03:52.920 --> 04:00.440]  safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully, culprit.
[04:00.440 --> 04:07.880]  Callously, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none.
[04:07.880 --> 04:13.640]  Some of you in this room may be fortunate not to live in cities or working for companies
[04:13.640 --> 04:20.280]  or protected by law or by policy, with privilege and access to defend yourselves and your families.
[04:20.280 --> 04:27.960]  But across the country, too many of our fellow Americans lack those basic comforts, and that's
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.120]  especially true for young people.
[04:32.120 --> 04:35.800]  Many of you are familiar with the Trevor Project and the suit.
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.480]  All right, this is just total loads of bull, if you know the facts.
[04:39.480 --> 04:41.960]  I mean, Trump's bringing the prosperity for everybody.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.360]  These guys suppress it on purpose.
[04:43.360 --> 04:48.800]  Look at blue cities they run, hell holes of degradation and pain.
[04:48.800 --> 04:55.320]  It's all coming up on this live global transmission, infowars.com, newswars.com, spread those links
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.400]  or we don't have any hope against these horrible bloodsuckers.

[06:22.800 --> 06:29.080]  It's Sunday, September 16, 2018, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:29.080 --> 06:31.720]  We're here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[06:31.720 --> 06:35.520]  We're back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and all the other great live broadcasts.
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.900]  We have the somalcast on AM and FM stations, TV, cable around the country.
[06:39.900 --> 06:47.520]  I saw the new talking point over the weekend from CNBC, Reuters, CNN, after the fall of
[06:47.520 --> 06:49.440]  Alex Jones.
[06:49.440 --> 06:52.400]  The rise and fall of Alex Jones.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.440]  We have a bigger audience than we've ever had.
[06:55.440 --> 06:57.280]  I've got our own internal numbers.
[06:57.280 --> 06:59.560]  I've shown the videos.
[06:59.560 --> 07:01.840]  We can have a go on Twitter before they ban that.
[07:01.840 --> 07:08.400]  Look, here's Google Analytics, record-trafficking, but they want that perception that if you
[07:08.400 --> 07:12.960]  don't go along with the globalists, if you don't go along with open borders or gun control,
[07:12.960 --> 07:16.720]  you're not going to get an admission to college, you're not going to get a corporate job, you're
[07:16.720 --> 07:20.600]  not going to have any access online, you better submit.
[07:20.600 --> 07:26.520]  So, they're trying to bully the American people, and now it's come out.
[07:26.520 --> 07:28.760]  The tables have been turned.
[07:28.760 --> 07:34.000]  Think Progress, another George Soros-funded fake news outlet, gets censored by Facebook
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.080]  fact-checkers, stories up on infowars.com, got picked up by a bunch of publications,
[07:40.080 --> 07:44.080]  and here they are calling for me to be banned just a few weeks ago and celebrating it.
[07:44.080 --> 07:52.160]  And then they're like, how dare Facebook censor us saying that Kavanaugh said that he wants
[07:52.160 --> 07:55.080]  to overturn Roe v. Wade, which he never said.
[07:55.080 --> 08:03.240]  And so they had the neocon outfit, weekly standard come, and they're now part of the
[08:03.240 --> 08:07.080]  fact-checking group, along with the Southern Prairie Law Center and Media Matters and
[08:07.080 --> 08:12.120]  George Soros' groups, and Snopes, famously fake.
[08:12.120 --> 08:14.360]  So that's the group that lied about WMDs in Iraq.
[08:14.360 --> 08:16.120]  That's the group that was never Trump.
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.040]  That's the group that has been involved in so much corruption, headed up by Mr. Crystal,
[08:21.040 --> 08:24.880]  whose father was the head of the Trotskyites and the famous communist, worked for Leon
[08:24.880 --> 08:26.880]  Trotsky.
[08:26.880 --> 08:30.280]  That is one of the worst groups you could have, but of course they've got the Democrats
[08:30.280 --> 08:34.880]  coming in and censoring, and now we've got to have token conservatives from the weekly
[08:34.880 --> 08:40.600]  standard who are even worse than the Democrats in many cases, warmongering neocons.
[08:40.600 --> 08:45.080]  And they'll be the new superclass that decides what's real and not, and so they'll just
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.440]  remove it off Facebook and then give a warning to think progress that if you do this anymore,
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.880]  we may ban you.
[08:55.880 --> 08:57.880]  Think about that.
[08:57.880 --> 09:04.600]  A ruling Republican Democrat blue blood establishment that decides who and who can't post and what's
[09:04.600 --> 09:05.880]  real and what isn't.
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.440]  Oh, there'll be no, in fact, checking weekly standard or CNN, even though Anderson Cooper
[09:12.440 --> 09:17.160]  got caught standing there up to his chest in a creek claiming he was amongst flooded
[09:17.160 --> 09:21.560]  houses with his crew all standing around him on dry ground, or the weather channel,
[09:21.560 --> 09:25.400]  or the guy being blown everywhere, and people just stroll right past him like it's no big
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.400]  deal.
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.880]  We all know what's fake.
[09:27.880 --> 09:29.080]  We can make our own decision.
[09:29.080 --> 09:32.640]  We can smell the truth, as Tucker Carlson says.
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.400]  So let it all rise or fall and let the people decide.
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.760]  Don't have fact checkers, failed CNN, failed New York Times, failed weekly standard that
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.600]  loses money every month.
[09:47.600 --> 09:56.080]  Don't have them as the new superclass that is up there deciding what you can and can't
[09:56.080 --> 09:57.080]  see.
[09:57.080 --> 09:58.080]  Let us see it all.
[09:58.080 --> 10:02.720]  Let's see, we're not being banned and restricted because M. Full Wars is a lie, we're being
[10:02.720 --> 10:07.720]  banned and restricted because what we're saying is the truth and is viral and is infectious
[10:07.720 --> 10:09.720]  and here's the key.
[10:09.720 --> 10:15.520]  They want to remove us off air so that they can then lie about us and say whatever they
[10:15.520 --> 10:25.760]  want by building a straw man and go into the ring, go to the arena and beat us up.
[10:25.760 --> 10:30.280]  And then we don't have a chance to respond.
[10:30.280 --> 10:34.920]  If you want to see the article, we'll pull it up from infowars.com.
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.280]  Anderson Cooper caught in massive fake news.
[10:39.280 --> 10:47.800]  Anderson Cooper caught in deception of the American people.
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.040]  Anderson Cooper caught in major performance art.
[10:52.040 --> 11:02.480]  Can't they even report on the weather accurately?
[11:02.480 --> 11:04.600]  Can't they even do that?
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.560]  And the answer is no, they can't because they're all about deception.
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.200]  They teach in journalism school how to lie now.
[11:14.200 --> 11:19.560]  Member Gruber said he was hired by Obama to lie to people and Obama admitted it and he's
[11:19.560 --> 11:23.040]  up there at universities giving speeches to graduate students about how to be a better
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.360]  liar and how to deceive people and they're all rubbing their hands together like he's
[11:27.360 --> 11:30.240]  God.
[11:30.240 --> 11:35.280]  So the fact that they've gotten away with so much to them means well, Trump only got
[11:35.280 --> 11:43.280]  in because we didn't lie enough, you see, but they can't have the real fact checkers
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.320]  out there like infowars, they can't have us there because then it calls them on their
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.320]  lives.
[11:51.320 --> 11:57.760]  They want to as a big, corporate, massive group lie to us in mass and not have anyone
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.400]  be able to oppose it or respond to it in any way.
[12:03.400 --> 12:10.840]  Now we come back from break, a lengthy Joe Biden speech that tells whopper after whopper
[12:10.840 --> 12:11.840]  after whopper.
[12:11.840 --> 12:15.560]  I'm going to try to just get to a few clips of it and just analyze the lies that are there.
[12:15.560 --> 12:23.480]  But it is like the worst around the fire stories you're trying to tell when you're out camping
[12:23.480 --> 12:26.520]  with your dad and your grandpa and they try to scare you when you're five years old and
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.800]  they go, let us tell you the story of the headless ghoul that rides through this area
[12:30.800 --> 12:31.800]  of Texas.
[12:31.800 --> 12:39.560]  Oh, he's got big red eyes and big long fangs and he's got a fork tail and just legend has
[12:39.560 --> 12:40.560]  it near here.
[12:40.560 --> 12:45.720]  Years ago, he grabbed some kids during the night, he's up there going, they were out
[12:45.720 --> 12:51.840]  on horses with white hoods, burning torches and Trump wouldn't stop them.
[12:51.840 --> 12:52.840]  They're the KKK.
[12:52.840 --> 13:01.200]  I mean, it is the most ridiculous lies when it's the Democratic Party and the Republicans
[13:01.200 --> 13:05.800]  that passed the Civil Rights Act, Martin Luther King was a Republican, but the public doesn't
[13:05.800 --> 13:09.040]  have history so they don't know.
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.480]  That's all coming up in the next segment and Matt Drudge warns of midterm blood blast.
[13:15.480 --> 13:22.040]  Trump to lose 60 seats in the house like Obama unless we'll give you the unless we've got
[13:22.040 --> 13:28.400]  Cortez on how she'd pay $40 trillion for socialist programs with $2 trillion falling flat on
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.800]  her face.
[13:29.800 --> 13:34.760]  We've got the New York Times and others now saying that again, Obama gets credit for the
[13:34.760 --> 13:38.480]  economy, but since Trump's getting credit, let's just change how the numbers are looked
[13:38.480 --> 13:39.480]  at.
[13:39.480 --> 13:46.400]  Hollywood celebrates Paul Manafort guilty plea, checkmate F U Trump, but it's he's pleading
[13:46.400 --> 13:50.560]  guilty on not paying taxes 15 years ago.
[13:50.560 --> 13:51.840]  So where's your Russia gate?
[13:51.840 --> 13:54.400]  See, it's not that now.
[13:54.400 --> 13:58.080]  We're also going to look at young girl raped by 100 Islamic men.
[13:58.080 --> 14:07.720]  You'll see how the mainstream media spun that and so much more here today and we also have
[14:07.720 --> 14:08.720]  an amazing report.
[14:08.720 --> 14:11.920]  Emily, we were Democrats are desperate for black vote, but they're not getting it.
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.240]  That's why they're so scared.
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.440]  Another key report as well.
[14:16.440 --> 14:23.440]  When I had Eric bowling formerly a Fox News, I would see our TV here in studio.
[14:23.440 --> 14:26.880]  Last week, he said, you know, how dare you say there were bombs in the buildings?
[14:26.880 --> 14:29.120]  How dare you say that?
[14:29.120 --> 14:34.560]  And I said, Eric, I have clips of Trump saying he said, I want to see him.
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.680]  We were five minutes towards the end of the show and I said, I'll make a special video
[14:38.680 --> 14:40.360]  for you and then we'll air it.
[14:40.360 --> 14:41.360]  Then I'll send you that video.
[14:41.360 --> 14:47.120]  So we're going to premiere it here tonight, start of the next hour and Roger Stone's all
[14:47.120 --> 14:48.120]  big exclusive news.
[14:48.120 --> 14:53.080]  And then I'm going to put it up to infowars.com on our own video feeds and we're going to
[14:53.080 --> 14:55.280]  send that out to Mr. Bowling.
[14:55.280 --> 14:56.920]  He's a good guy.
[14:56.920 --> 15:03.840]  He means, well, he's a boy scout and he's an economist and he just can't believe where
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.520]  I get this stuff that I heard that day there were bombs in the buildings.
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.520]  Now, now maybe that's not true, but the media attacked me and said it never happened.
[15:12.520 --> 15:18.240]  I talked to the police that said, no, the feds were inside building seven and said,
[15:18.240 --> 15:19.240]  get ready.
[15:19.240 --> 15:21.400]  They had a 10 second countdown and blew it up.
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.800]  And guess what on PBS inadvertently, they had the video of the countdown and seven being
[15:26.800 --> 15:27.800]  blown up.
[15:27.800 --> 15:28.800]  So you're going to see all that.
[15:28.800 --> 15:29.800]  It's a six minute video.
[15:29.800 --> 15:33.280]  We got a 15 minute one coming out Tuesday.
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.160]  So I'm just going to show you why I question that mean I don't think Islamic terror is

[18:57.720 --> 19:04.040]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and
[19:04.040 --> 19:07.400]  how much we were buying and they said, oh we want more money, more money and oh this
[19:07.400 --> 19:13.240]  and that and so I've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[19:13.240 --> 19:17.240]  ingredient that goes in X2 that literally is so pure that if you put in a peaker dish
[19:17.240 --> 19:22.760]  on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses like I dream of genie and it's purple gas.
[19:22.760 --> 19:26.080]  I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[19:26.080 --> 19:31.240]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now but I bought a huge amount of it
[19:31.240 --> 19:35.440]  ordered at six months ago so I get the price down and I said if you don't lower it I'm
[19:35.440 --> 19:40.480]  done I'm breaking the contract well I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially
[19:40.480 --> 19:41.480]  the last run.
[19:41.480 --> 19:46.240]  So right now it is the last run, there's a viable shield X2 and we've got a good supply
[19:46.240 --> 19:48.080]  of it but it'll be gone in a couple of months.
[19:48.080 --> 19:52.080]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, infowarstore.com, if you have experienced it and you're not
[19:52.080 --> 19:54.360]  ready to use, I suggest you stock up on it.
[19:54.360 --> 20:02.320]  It's available right now for a limited time, infowarstore.com, it's 25% off right now.
[20:02.320 --> 20:13.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:13.840 --> 20:36.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:36.960 --> 20:42.960]  So we always hear that Trump is this really mean person, he wants to shut down free speech
[20:42.960 --> 20:48.200]  but he's not calling for shutting down anybody's free speech, it's the mainstream corporate
[20:48.200 --> 20:52.840]  media that wants all conservatives, all libertarians, all Christians, all veterans groups banned
[20:52.840 --> 20:53.840]  off the internet.
[20:53.840 --> 21:01.800]  We've got U.S. Senators Wyden and Warner and Murphy saying Alex Jones is only the beginning,
[21:01.800 --> 21:04.200]  get rid of thousands, get rid of Rush Limbaugh.
[21:04.200 --> 21:09.680]  We have the Federal Election Commission persecuting anybody that donates to Republicans.
[21:09.680 --> 21:12.960]  We have the IRS going after churches and Christian groups.
[21:12.960 --> 21:17.920]  We have a reign of terror and bullying going on.
[21:17.920 --> 21:23.480]  But then we've got Joe Biden with all of his corruption and protecting Bill Clinton who
[21:23.480 --> 21:30.200]  protected Al Qaeda and then supporting the Arab Spring under Obama and Hillary and uranium
[21:30.200 --> 21:36.720]  one and the KKK background of the Democrats saying that he wants to pick a fight with
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.240]  the bullies, meaning Trump and their supporters.
[21:40.240 --> 21:45.320]  Now you're the ones beating us over the head with bike locks, throwing coffee on us, shooting
[21:45.320 --> 21:50.640]  Congressman Scalise, calling for Trump's overthrow, calling for the economy to be destroyed so
[21:50.640 --> 21:52.520]  that we can stop Trump.
[21:52.520 --> 21:56.160]  That's the Democrats.
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.720]  But now he says we're the dregs of society.
[21:59.720 --> 22:02.040]  Let's look up the definition of dregs.
[22:02.040 --> 22:12.040]  It means winos, drug addicts, pickpockets, thugs, child molesters, murderers, ex-convicts,
[22:12.040 --> 22:17.120]  the lowest of the low, the remains of liquid left in a container together with sediment
[22:17.120 --> 22:24.040]  or grounds, the most worthless parts of something, the crap inside intestines.
[22:24.040 --> 22:29.280]  You can take pig intestines and make chitlins, got to clean out the crap, boil the guts and
[22:29.280 --> 22:33.600]  then fry them, I've had them, it's a southern dish.
[22:33.600 --> 22:38.920]  But the dregs would be the guts, you throw out the dregs.
[22:38.920 --> 22:45.120]  So if you go to a Democratic Party function or a liberal event, they look like they're
[22:45.120 --> 22:46.620]  dead.
[22:46.620 --> 22:51.280]  They look like they've been beaten ahead with a baseball bat, they stumble around, most
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.880]  people can hardly talk, and I don't feel powerful when I see a group of Democrats, I feel sorry
[22:56.880 --> 22:57.880]  for them.
[22:57.880 --> 23:01.800]  That's why they're really censoring conservatives and nationalists off of Facebook and Twitter
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.120]  and YouTube, because we would all, even under censorship, we used to have videos with 30,
[23:06.120 --> 23:10.640]  40 million views, under censorship, routinely a million, two million views, going out and
[23:10.640 --> 23:15.560]  just pointing a camera at a crowd of Democrats with the after mother, white people, they're
[23:15.560 --> 23:22.840]  monkey subhumans, you know, we're going to kill you, and then you go to the next person
[23:22.840 --> 23:28.240]  and the next person and the next person and the next person and the next person, and they
[23:28.240 --> 23:33.520]  all sound like something out of a Hellraiser movie.
[23:33.520 --> 23:43.040]  So when he calls us dregs, think about the projection that Joe Biden's involved in, because
[23:43.040 --> 23:50.040]  Hillary in the WikiLeaks calls her supporters worthless, dumb, stupid, baristas that want
[23:50.040 --> 23:54.840]  something more from her when they're lazy living in their mom's basement, close quote.
[23:54.840 --> 23:58.080]  Trump says, I want to get you out of your mom's basement, I believe in you, whether
[23:58.080 --> 24:02.040]  you're white or black, and you see him try to move us an economy back and have a culture
[24:02.040 --> 24:07.280]  of working, and they flip out and say, he's a loser, he's a crazy man, he's the worst
[24:07.280 --> 24:10.880]  thing since, gonorrhea.
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.400]  So let's start going to this Joe Biden piece.
[24:15.400 --> 24:32.040]  Joe Biden refers to Trump supporters as dregs of society, here he is.
[24:32.040 --> 24:34.040]  So there's your dregs of society clip.
[24:34.040 --> 24:38.800]  Now let's go to a larger clip where he talks about the KKK riding through the night with
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.280]  burning torches and they're coming to get you like they're telling ghost stories to
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.120]  little kids, and they're the people that hate you if you're gay, and they're the people
[24:48.120 --> 24:53.320]  that hate you if you're black, but here's the good news, Americans, no matter what color
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.800]  they are or where they came from, are figuring out that the Trump economy is a lot better,
[24:57.800 --> 25:02.080]  that the establishment is against Trump, so let's go ahead and start going to this.
[25:02.080 --> 25:14.040]  But this onslaught that we're seeing does require, require us not only to be vigilant,
[25:14.040 --> 25:23.280]  but be more aggressive and demand more, demand more of our leaders who represent basic American
[25:23.280 --> 25:29.080]  values of respect, decency, equality, giving hate no safe haven.
[25:29.080 --> 25:36.400]  Giving hate no safe haven, that means anything they define the Second Amendment, the nuclear
[25:36.400 --> 25:45.680]  family saying he or she being bad in the US, Canada, Sweden, being masculine, being feminine,
[25:45.680 --> 25:50.320]  whatever they want to define as something they want to attack, they say, don't give
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.800]  your speech safe haven, believe me, we know bullies, you're not giving speech a safe haven.
[25:55.800 --> 25:56.800]  Let's continue.
[25:56.800 --> 26:03.040]  We hold these truths self-evident, all men are critical and found by their creator.
[26:03.040 --> 26:09.640]  Sounds corny when you say it, but the American people basically in their gut, we've never
[26:09.640 --> 26:13.840]  met it, but that's the aspiration and they're not giving up on it.
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.720]  Let's pause again.
[26:15.720 --> 26:19.400]  It's true that those great ideas have never been met, but the idea of meeting it has brought
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.840]  us further than many other nations, that probably more than anybody, the American system.
[26:23.840 --> 26:25.560]  So why are we the bad guys?
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.160]  Why do we have to be the Nazis?
[26:27.160 --> 26:30.600]  Why do we have to be the evil folks when our history doesn't show that?
[26:30.600 --> 26:36.080]  But again, this is coming to you from the Democratic Party and somebody that literally
[26:36.080 --> 26:42.000]  was under Senator Byrd, who was a grand dragon in the KKK and the Democratic Party, but he
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.200]  thinks you have no memory.
[26:43.200 --> 26:44.200]  Let's continue.
[26:44.200 --> 26:48.920]  You know, Barack and I agreed to be raised silent for a while to give this administration
[26:48.920 --> 26:50.960]  a chance to get up and running the first year.
[26:50.960 --> 26:55.960]  Let's pause again, back it up 10 seconds, they were never quiet through their surrogates.
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.200]  It came out in all the different documents and lawsuits and FBI files that the Democrats
[27:00.200 --> 27:06.040]  led by Obama, Hillary and others have been orchestrating the fake PP gate dossier.
[27:06.040 --> 27:08.560]  They've been launching the attacks on Trump.
[27:08.560 --> 27:10.200]  They've been trying to block everything.
[27:10.200 --> 27:12.240]  Oh, but they gave him a chance.
[27:12.240 --> 27:14.000]  They tried to make him succeed.
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.560]  The media, the Democrats, you know, gave Trump that honeymoon period that every other president
[27:18.560 --> 27:19.560]  got.
[27:19.560 --> 27:21.240]  There was no honeymoon period.
[27:21.240 --> 27:22.840]  They tried to keep him from getting his delegates.
[27:22.840 --> 27:25.440]  They tried to keep him from even becoming the president.
[27:25.440 --> 27:29.880]  They tried to riot and block the entrances to his inauguration and then lied about who
[27:29.880 --> 27:33.080]  was there.
[27:33.080 --> 27:34.840]  Everything Biden says is a lie.
[27:34.840 --> 27:35.840]  Continue.
[27:35.840 --> 27:38.440]  You're not given up on it.
[27:38.440 --> 27:42.520]  You know, Barack and I agreed to be raised silent for a while to give this administration
[27:42.520 --> 27:48.120]  a chance to get up and running the first year.
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.120]  Don't forgive me.
[27:51.120 --> 28:00.120]  You're not remained silent after Charlottesville.
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.600]  No, I want to be deadly earnest with you about this.
[28:04.600 --> 28:05.600]  Let's pause again.
[28:05.600 --> 28:08.200]  We're going to come back with the rest of this.
[28:08.200 --> 28:16.160]  Charlottesville, one woman run over by a crowd attacking a car and the guy guns it and runs
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.000]  over and I point out that George Soros funded Antifa.
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.520]  The police stood down.
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.600]  You have the alt-right people who most of them used to work for the Democrats clearly feds.
[28:26.600 --> 28:29.160]  You have this big production they do.
[28:29.160 --> 28:31.880]  Trump says both sides are bad.
[28:31.880 --> 28:32.880]  Antifa's bad.
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.760]  And I think KKK type folks, KKK lights bad, but he said it's Antifa that attacked, which
[28:38.760 --> 28:41.640]  is totally true.
[28:41.640 --> 28:43.560]  And then, oh, this is their big thing.
[28:43.560 --> 28:46.440]  This guy funded the Arab Spring that killed millions of people.
[28:46.440 --> 28:51.640]  Biden, his son, runs part of Ukraine and all the stolen natural gas there.
[28:51.640 --> 28:52.640]  He's a monster.
[28:52.640 --> 28:56.320]  But he sits there and says America's ethos is the KKK.
[28:56.320 --> 28:58.080]  No, it's your ethos.
[28:58.080 --> 29:03.040]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[29:03.040 --> 29:04.760]  and joint support.
[29:04.760 --> 29:07.920]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[29:07.920 --> 29:11.720]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[29:11.720 --> 29:16.080]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.240]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[29:20.240 --> 29:24.520]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[29:24.520 --> 29:29.720]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and

[29:31.480 --> 29:35.960]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[29:35.960 --> 29:41.680]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[29:41.680 --> 29:47.640]  These combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme
[29:47.640 --> 29:50.520]  to work synergistically for full body support.

[30:01.240 --> 30:06.680]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand
[30:06.680 --> 30:14.600]  that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material

[31:22.560 --> 31:28.200]  campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our first amendment rights.

[31:59.520 --> 32:04.760]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[32:04.760 --> 32:09.920]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[32:09.920 --> 32:16.760]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[32:16.760 --> 32:22.640]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[32:22.640 --> 32:25.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[32:25.960 --> 32:30.880]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[32:30.880 --> 32:37.360]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[32:37.360 --> 32:40.800]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[32:40.800 --> 32:45.560]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[32:45.560 --> 32:51.360]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[32:51.360 --> 32:54.080]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[32:54.080 --> 33:02.360]  Visit infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[33:02.360 --> 33:22.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:22.560 --> 33:31.360]  A changing war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.360 --> 33:43.280]  So, Joe Biden came out and he went beyond saying that Trump supporters are deplorable.
[33:43.280 --> 33:49.440]  He went on to basically, well, I mean, here's the exact quote, the dregs of society, which
[33:49.440 --> 33:50.440]  were already played.
[33:50.440 --> 33:56.560]  So, getting back into his speech, he talks about the KKK riders and their hoods in the
[33:56.560 --> 34:03.680]  night and like they're galloping, they're galloping, they're galloping like you're
[34:03.680 --> 34:09.360]  in the woods and here comes the evil rider to get you.
[34:09.360 --> 34:15.800]  Total fair mongering and is it lost on society that Democrats were the party of the KKK?
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.760]  Is it lost on everybody that they're the ones creating racial division in America at every
[34:19.760 --> 34:20.760]  level?
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.160]  And again, it's even in their own WikiLeaks that they want to create racial division to
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.960]  control people because they're not going to give you jobs, they're not going to give you
[34:26.960 --> 34:31.840]  a future like all the blue cities, they're going to give you poverty, they're going to
[34:31.840 --> 34:39.240]  give you enslavement, they're going to give you being domesticated.
[34:39.240 --> 34:44.800]  The good news is you look at the Democratic Party, they're led by Nancy Pelosi, who can
[34:44.800 --> 34:51.600]  hardly talk, they're led by Joe Biden who looks like he was a dead body at the morgue
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.640]  that somebody hooked electricity up to that was reanimated for the speech and he's spewing
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.360]  all the same old garbage.
[35:01.360 --> 35:06.920]  And so that's the good news is that people are sick of this and they're tired of it and
[35:06.920 --> 35:14.000]  they see through it, but Joe Biden is still a clear and present danger because he's not
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.160]  going to ever stop until he realizes that you're not buying into it.
[35:18.160 --> 35:23.960]  Because as I said earlier, when they overthrew Ukraine, George Soros five years ago, his
[35:23.960 --> 35:34.320]  son took control of the $10 billion gas company that comes out of Russia and he now makes
[35:34.320 --> 35:36.520]  hundreds of millions a year, his son.
[35:36.520 --> 35:39.240]  That's an example of the criminal looting.
[35:39.240 --> 35:44.720]  They're not going to stop till the last minute because they're stealing the whole time.
[35:44.720 --> 35:47.240]  That's why they're never going to back down, they're never going to give up.
[35:47.240 --> 35:52.440]  And they're also like cornered rats, so there's no end to what they will do now.
[35:52.440 --> 35:54.800]  They are so dangerous, they are so evil.
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.120]  Let's continue.
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.680]  That's why I wrote an article for Atlantic Magazine entitled The Battle for America's
[36:02.680 --> 36:09.880]  Soul, because don't clap or you can boo if you want, but don't clap.
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.800]  But I'm serious, I'm serious.
[36:13.800 --> 36:25.200]  This is about basic decency, the idea that goons could come out of fields at night with
[36:25.200 --> 36:35.080]  lighted torches carrying Nazi flags chanting the same exact anti-semitic bile that was
[36:35.080 --> 36:37.680]  chanted in the streets of Nuremberg and Berlin.
[36:37.680 --> 36:38.920]  Let's hit pause again.
[36:38.920 --> 36:48.880]  Look at how he drools the same anti-semitic bile that was chanted in the streets of Germany.
[36:48.880 --> 36:57.240]  And it was George Soros, who was the Nazi collaborator as the main funder of the Democrats.
[36:57.240 --> 37:02.360]  When it's Junker, whose family was the richest family in Germany as Nazis who run the EU
[37:02.360 --> 37:10.280]  today that was a Hitler plan, when they're the ones using racial division.
[37:10.280 --> 37:15.040]  But they got it set up in Hollywood like if you're American and you're pro-freedom and
[37:15.040 --> 37:28.000]  you're pro-second amendment and you're pro-free market, you are a Nazi.
[37:28.000 --> 37:35.120]  And now you saw where a guy at the Coast Guard headquarters being pro-Trump did this sign
[37:35.120 --> 37:43.200]  and they removed him, fired him off the job, and then the Coast Guard apologized for the
[37:43.200 --> 37:44.200]  Nazi sign.
[37:44.200 --> 37:48.600]  Well, I say that the Apple sign, which we're getting rid of in the company, because it's
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.840]  so fascist working with China now, I say it's a sign that supports China that kills more
[37:53.840 --> 37:54.840]  people than Hitler ever did.
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.120]  So I say I don't want to see the Apple sign because to me it's offensive, but see that's
[37:59.120 --> 38:00.120]  not going to happen.
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.880]  Plus, I don't want to get rid of symbols.
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.240]  They just want to be able to say whatever symbols they want are evil and remove whatever
[38:06.240 --> 38:11.720]  they want because they're at war with language because tyranny is something that isn't popular
[38:11.720 --> 38:15.440]  and people don't want it, so they have to sabotage it.
[38:15.440 --> 38:19.440]  Let's go ahead and go back to Joe Biden.
[38:19.440 --> 38:28.480]  The carrying of Nazi flights chanting the same exact anti-semitic bio that was chanting
[38:28.480 --> 38:29.480]  the streets of New York.
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.160]  And I forgot all three of the leaders worked for Obama within one year, Hillary, and then
[38:34.160 --> 38:39.760]  they all suddenly went from big university operators with parents of the Democratic Party,
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.880]  some of them intelligence groups, to going out marching around with torches dressed
[38:43.880 --> 38:48.000]  in 1930s outfits so that people think Nazis are invading.
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.520]  And how many times has the Southern Property Law Center and ADL and others been caught
[38:52.520 --> 38:54.000]  posing as Nazis?
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  How many times?
[38:55.000 --> 38:59.940]  I got a stack of news where Muslims have been caught in the U.S. and Canada this week staging
[38:59.940 --> 39:02.960]  attacks on themselves that they did.
[39:02.960 --> 39:07.800]  Let's go back to Joe Biden.
[39:07.800 --> 39:12.800]  In Berlin, in every other German city in the 30s.
[39:12.800 --> 39:17.800]  It's serious, guys, so hush up.
[39:17.800 --> 39:19.800]  This is deadly earnest.
[39:19.800 --> 39:20.800]  Yes, the Nazis are here.
[39:20.800 --> 39:26.720]  We are in a fight for America's soul and we have leaders.
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.560]  We have leaders with the time when that occurred when these guys were accompanied by white
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.640]  supremacists and Ku Klux Klan and those who objected making a comparison saying they're
[39:37.640 --> 39:39.480]  good people in both groups.
[39:39.480 --> 39:41.920]  What has become of us?
[39:41.920 --> 39:49.440]  Our children are listening and our silence is complicity.
[39:49.440 --> 39:53.880]  Our silence is complicity.
[39:53.880 --> 39:58.720]  You know, Trump got a briefing to Charlottesville from Homeland Security who had agents there
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.960]  and they said, sir, it was some reporters on both sides, some pro-peace people on one
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.960]  side, Antifa's bad, and then some Nazis on the other side that were bad.
[40:06.960 --> 40:11.360]  So Trump goes, well, the Nazis were bad and so was the Antifa was bad, and there were
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.560]  good people on both sides as well.
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.960]  That was given to him in the briefing.
[40:15.960 --> 40:21.080]  You had a bunch of people out there to cover it, a bunch of peace people, a bunch of right-wing
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.160]  pro-free speech people, and then you had some Nazis and some Antifa that, yeah, I think
[40:25.160 --> 40:28.760]  we all agree are unsavory folks.
[40:28.760 --> 40:30.440]  But that's how this works.
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.440]  Well, good job of the crew.
[40:31.440 --> 40:32.440]  They actually found the photo.
[40:32.440 --> 40:35.120]  Remember that of Trump being briefed on Charlottesville.
[40:35.120 --> 40:36.120]  He didn't know what it was.
[40:36.120 --> 40:37.760]  He went and said, what is this?
[40:37.760 --> 40:40.720]  They said, here it is, sir.
[40:40.720 --> 40:46.360]  So he went out there, but imagine in America, the Communist Chinese have killed 100 plus
[40:46.360 --> 40:50.720]  million people.
[40:50.720 --> 40:51.720]  They've done that.
[40:51.720 --> 40:52.720]  They're their own people.
[40:52.720 --> 40:53.940]  Never a word about them.
[40:53.940 --> 40:57.840]  Never about Apple and slave factories and suicide nets.
[40:57.840 --> 40:59.720]  Never about Google helping round up political dissidents.
[40:59.720 --> 41:05.800]  It's all about America and Nazis and Charlottesville.
[41:05.800 --> 41:11.440]  The people with torches, all 20 of them, are coming to get you, and you better do what
[41:11.440 --> 41:14.960]  Joe Biden says, or the Nazis will get you.
[41:14.960 --> 41:21.600]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[41:21.600 --> 41:28.720]  And really, what it was was the art club from a couple local universities with guys that
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.800]  get Southern Primary Law Center money coming out in court who just all dress up like Nazis
[41:33.800 --> 41:36.520]  to go scare the hell out of everybody and go after Trump.
[41:36.520 --> 41:37.520]  That's what the left is.
[41:37.520 --> 41:38.880]  They're a drama club.
[41:38.880 --> 41:40.320]  They are thespians.
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.320]  They are actors.
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.480]  It's what they do.
[41:42.480 --> 41:46.360]  It's what they constantly get caught doing, and they don't want us to know that.
[41:46.360 --> 41:51.560]  Anderson Cooper stood in water up to his chest in a ditch to say the houses were flooded
[41:51.560 --> 41:56.320]  when they weren't.
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.560]  The Weather Channel was being blown all over the place.
[41:58.560 --> 41:59.560]  People were calling behind him.
[41:59.560 --> 42:01.120]  It was fake.
[42:01.120 --> 42:03.000]  It's what they do.
[42:03.000 --> 42:08.960]  They are the fraud, and they don't want you asking questions.
[42:08.960 --> 42:10.200]  They don't want you talking about it.
[42:10.200 --> 42:17.000]  They want to put out their fake info and have you going to suspend a disbelief and have
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.280]  you believe that it's all real.
[42:20.280 --> 42:23.920]  But once somebody's awake to a scam, they never go back, and that's what they don't
[42:23.920 --> 42:24.920]  get.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.040]  There is going to be a big giant red wave.
[42:27.040 --> 42:45.280]  The question is, will the seawall of the Democratic Party, will the Democratic Party, be able to
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.320]  build a big enough wall to block that seawall, the election fraud, and the rest of it?
[42:50.320 --> 42:52.040]  I'm going to keep fighting to the end, regardless.
[42:52.040 --> 42:54.040]  I don't know if you are, but I sure as hell am.
[42:54.040 --> 42:58.240]  Because I'm conscious I'm not dead yet.
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.160]  Living in Volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:02.160 --> 43:06.680]  The real drama can be found here in Lailania states, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.120]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:12.120 --> 43:17.520]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:17.520 --> 43:19.040]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:19.040 --> 43:25.600]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:25.600 --> 43:29.580]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:29.580 --> 43:31.080]  in the rainwater.
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.280]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[43:36.280 --> 43:42.360]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:42.360 --> 43:48.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:48.000 --> 43:53.320]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.400]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:58.400 --> 44:03.280]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.760]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[44:07.760 --> 44:12.800]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[44:12.800 --> 44:17.980]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new Platinum

[47:28.320 --> 47:37.560]  Alex Jones back live broadcasting worldwide.
[47:37.560 --> 47:43.400]  I want to get into what's happening right now
[47:43.400 --> 47:48.080]  with the attempt to confer Brett Kavanaugh
[47:48.080 --> 47:51.480]  to the Supreme Court and how they float this whole thing
[47:51.480 --> 47:53.800]  about 35 years ago in high school,
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.120]  he might have jumped on top of a girl at a drunk party.
[47:58.120 --> 48:00.280]  And now they've got the person going public.
[48:04.080 --> 48:08.720]  I have personally experienced mainstream media
[48:08.720 --> 48:10.960]  go out and offer people money to lie about me.
[48:14.840 --> 48:16.880]  And when you see it in print, you know
[48:16.880 --> 48:18.960]  how criminal these groups are, and the fact
[48:18.960 --> 48:24.840]  that Democrats believe it's their duty
[48:24.840 --> 48:27.040]  to go out and make things up.
[48:27.040 --> 48:29.480]  When you see something like this, it doesn't hold any water.
[48:32.560 --> 48:36.040]  In fact, we're going to get to it here in just a moment.
[48:36.040 --> 48:39.960]  But it's amazing the links to which this stuff will happen.
[48:39.960 --> 48:42.520]  And maybe this woman even believes it.
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.920]  We're going to get to that here in just a moment.
[48:44.920 --> 48:48.360]  But first, it's important to understand
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.320]  that I'm not really worried about me being
[48:51.320 --> 48:57.160]  platformed off of 90-plus platforms now.
[48:57.160 --> 49:00.560]  I'm concerned because it's concerted and it's corporate,
[49:00.560 --> 49:08.040]  and it's being done to many, many other people in unison,
[49:08.040 --> 49:11.480]  and by them picking info wars out to do it.
[49:11.480 --> 49:15.240]  And building a straw man, it distracts from the fact
[49:15.240 --> 49:19.560]  that it is monopolistic, it is racketeering,
[49:19.560 --> 49:22.200]  it is very, very dangerous what's
[49:22.200 --> 49:25.120]  going on by any yardstick.
[49:25.120 --> 49:33.400]  And the addled, tepid, sluggish, sloth-like response
[49:33.400 --> 49:38.400]  by the Republicans is horrifying.
[49:38.400 --> 49:39.800]  I haven't even gotten to this yet.
[49:39.800 --> 49:41.960]  We've got screenshots.
[49:41.960 --> 49:43.920]  And we've got IT people that gave us a report.
[49:43.920 --> 49:45.080]  And I'll put it out tomorrow.
[49:45.080 --> 49:47.160]  And it's exclusive.
[49:47.160 --> 49:55.680]  But we actually had software that we use banned over the weekend.
[49:55.680 --> 49:57.160]  And I've talked to lawyers about this.
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.280]  This is definitely illegal, definitely racketeering.
[50:01.280 --> 50:03.680]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[50:06.360 --> 50:07.680]  And it deals with Apple.
[50:07.680 --> 50:10.160]  And I'll try my best because there's
[50:10.160 --> 50:14.320]  a target fixation that goes on in warfare
[50:14.320 --> 50:17.120]  where you'll get fixated on your target,
[50:17.120 --> 50:19.720]  and then not even pay attention to what's happening to you.
[50:19.720 --> 50:22.560]  The famous case is people flying aircraft strafing,
[50:22.560 --> 50:25.960]  say, a train or a truck, and they'll fly into the vehicle.
[50:25.960 --> 50:29.480]  They'll just keep and fly into it.
[50:29.480 --> 50:31.040]  And we've got a great crew here.
[50:31.040 --> 50:31.920]  They're great people.
[50:31.920 --> 50:34.920]  But it's kind of like I learned about this on Friday,
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.640]  confirmed it with IT.
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.000]  It's the biggest story yet in our censorship.
[50:40.000 --> 50:41.800]  But see, just like the public's supposed
[50:41.800 --> 50:47.080]  to get conditioned to being censored and blacklisted and banned
[50:47.080 --> 50:51.160]  by info wars being in tens of thousands of articles,
[50:51.160 --> 50:53.760]  they're supposed to wear us out psychologically.
[50:53.760 --> 50:55.760]  Finally, when they start doing stuff
[50:55.760 --> 51:01.200]  like killing the software we use, it's like, so what?
[51:01.200 --> 51:03.360]  Everybody knows we're getting banned.
[51:03.360 --> 51:03.880]  So what?
[51:03.880 --> 51:06.080]  They took Alex away and killed him, too.
[51:06.080 --> 51:09.040]  You know, we knew it was coming.
[51:09.040 --> 51:10.720]  And it's just like that globalist told me
[51:10.720 --> 51:12.960]  that time off record, he's one of the heads,
[51:12.960 --> 51:15.320]  one of the big banks, one of the fourth-largest bank
[51:15.320 --> 51:17.800]  that time.
[51:17.800 --> 51:22.120]  He said, Alex, you're going to adapt to being a slave.
[51:22.120 --> 51:23.600]  People don't adapt to fighting it.
[51:26.800 --> 51:27.880]  He said, you will lose.
[51:33.880 --> 51:34.440]  And you know what?
[51:34.440 --> 51:35.240]  Maybe he's right.
[51:35.240 --> 51:40.600]  And then those of us that don't prey on you,
[51:40.600 --> 51:41.640]  we're the mentally ill ones.
[51:45.240 --> 51:49.040]  Because what the predators will tell you is,
[51:49.040 --> 51:52.600]  general public are just failed predators.
[51:52.600 --> 51:54.760]  And if you help them, they'll just tear you apart.
[51:54.760 --> 51:55.640]  But you know what?
[51:55.640 --> 51:58.000]  My soul tells me that's wrong, and I'm not going to act like that.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.200]  It was very, very frustrating, to say the least.
[52:02.200 --> 52:06.760]  And what they're doing to us is so sick.
[52:06.760 --> 52:08.280]  All of it's scientifically directed.
[52:14.560 --> 52:15.920]  So who knows?
[52:15.920 --> 52:19.440]  We may never even tell you, hell, they might just shut us
[52:19.440 --> 52:19.920]  down.
[52:19.920 --> 52:20.920]  We want to do an article.
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.080]  Hell, no one will tell you.
[52:22.080 --> 52:23.280]  We're going to do an article.
[52:23.280 --> 52:24.280]  We're going to do an article.
[52:24.280 --> 52:25.280]  We're going to do an article.
[52:25.280 --> 52:26.280]  We're going to do an article.
[52:26.280 --> 52:28.280]  We're going to do an article.
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.280]  Hell, no one will.
[52:29.280 --> 52:31.280]  You know, by the time they actually shut us down,
[52:31.280 --> 52:34.280]  there won't even be a story.
[52:34.280 --> 52:36.280]  They take me out and shoot me in the back of the head.
[52:36.280 --> 52:38.280]  By then, it's like, that's all news.
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.280]  They're going into people's phones and killing programs
[52:46.280 --> 52:48.280]  that came with the phones.
[52:48.280 --> 52:57.280]  They're going to be in full wars.com.
[52:57.280 --> 52:59.280]  But everybody still got their food.
[52:59.280 --> 53:01.280]  Everybody still can go home and watch television.
[53:01.280 --> 53:02.280]  So who cares?
[53:02.280 --> 53:04.280]  Exactly.
[53:04.280 --> 53:05.280]  Exactly.
[53:05.280 --> 53:06.280]  And that's why we fail.
[53:06.280 --> 53:08.280]  That's why we die.
[53:08.280 --> 53:11.280]  And I just watch us being incrementally enslaved.
[53:11.280 --> 53:12.280]  And I'm upset about it.
[53:12.280 --> 53:18.280]  And I'm supposed to see how that works and join it and farm you.
[53:18.280 --> 53:24.280]  I'm supposed to serve the globalist so I get life extension technology
[53:24.280 --> 53:27.280]  and I get cybernetic enhancement down the road.
[53:27.280 --> 53:30.280]  And I'm supposed to revel in how dumb you are.
[53:30.280 --> 53:31.280]  See?
[53:31.280 --> 53:35.280]  But instead, I get to be the bad guy because I'm trying to save you.
[53:35.280 --> 53:45.280]  Because I have some type of connection to you.
[53:45.280 --> 53:49.280]  It's beyond amazing.
[53:49.280 --> 53:52.280]  So people ask, you know, why is your broadcast banned?
[53:52.280 --> 53:54.280]  Why are they trying to ban it?
[53:54.280 --> 53:56.280]  Because of what we're covering and because they're going to go ahead
[53:56.280 --> 54:03.280]  and make that move and because they want to set the precedent.
[54:03.280 --> 54:06.280]  And I know this, I look at people that have decided to make these evil decisions
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.280]  and they are the most unhappy, twisted, physically ugly people on Earth.
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.280]  So let me tell you, metaphysically, culturally, and a gut level,
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.280]  I know not to join them.
[54:15.280 --> 54:19.280]  But the public needs to stand up for their own self-preservation.
[54:19.280 --> 54:22.280]  Now, this is funny for radio listeners.
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.280]  But it's really funny if you're a TV viewer at infowars.com,
[54:26.280 --> 54:28.280]  or it's last show or on TV stations around the country.
[54:28.280 --> 54:33.280]  Because this is a piece that Drew and Savannah put together a month and a half ago
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.280]  when our app went to number one on Apple and on Android.
[54:37.280 --> 54:41.280]  And then after it went to number one, they just removed the Apple one
[54:41.280 --> 54:43.280]  that had 2 million downloads.
[54:43.280 --> 54:47.280]  The Android is still there at infowars.com.
[54:47.280 --> 54:50.280]  But this is us making a joke out of what they did.
[54:50.280 --> 54:53.280]  But we knew the next move would be
[54:53.280 --> 54:58.280]  blockinfowars.com at the browser level.
[54:58.280 --> 55:03.280]  And that has now begun.
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.280]  And info wars will not be the one that breaks it.
[55:05.280 --> 55:07.280]  I'm going to let the enemy go ahead and do it now.
[55:07.280 --> 55:08.280]  No one cares around here.
[55:08.280 --> 55:09.280]  That's fine. I love it too.
[55:09.280 --> 55:10.280]  Great. That's fine. Yeah.
[55:10.280 --> 55:11.280]  Close our doors.
[55:11.280 --> 55:17.280]  So, we'll let the enemy break it.
[55:17.280 --> 55:20.280]  And let's see how they, oh, it's a private company.
[55:20.280 --> 55:23.280]  Oh, it's a, oh, you bought that phone.
[55:23.280 --> 55:26.280]  So they're blocking visiting infowars.com on an Apple phone.
[55:26.280 --> 55:28.280]  That's what they're doing now.
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.280]  And it's cute and it's fun and it's neat and it's great.
[55:32.280 --> 55:34.280]  And so here it is.
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.280]  Here's the clip.
[55:40.280 --> 55:42.280]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez.
[55:42.280 --> 55:45.280]  And if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer TV.
[55:45.280 --> 55:49.280]  So we just released our free info wars official app.
[55:49.280 --> 55:52.280]  The info wars official app includes all of our live broadcasts,
[55:52.280 --> 55:55.280]  like war room with Owen Schroyer, real news with David Knight,
[55:55.280 --> 55:58.280]  and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones show.
[55:58.280 --> 56:02.280]  And the best part about the info wars official app is that every single time you go live,
[56:02.280 --> 56:05.280]  you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[56:05.280 --> 56:07.280]  So whether you're in the car or on a run,
[56:07.280 --> 56:10.280]  this app makes it easy to keep the info war right in your pocket.
[56:10.280 --> 56:12.280]  So what are you waiting for?
[56:12.280 --> 56:13.280]  Sound like the info wars.
[56:13.280 --> 56:19.280]  The best info wars Apple ban your app.
[56:19.280 --> 56:21.280]  I helped too.
[56:21.280 --> 56:26.280]  Ah, Oliver.
[56:26.280 --> 56:28.280]  I hate free speech too.
[56:28.280 --> 56:37.280]  We hate free speech.
[56:37.280 --> 56:41.280]  But I can tell you, millions download the app,
[56:41.280 --> 56:43.280]  and they take it out of the store.
[56:43.280 --> 56:46.280]  Congress does nothing when that's so illegal.
[56:46.280 --> 56:49.280]  Next, they're going to go in and take the app off your phone.
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.280]  Next, they're going to block the info wars RSS feeder on Apple,
[56:53.280 --> 56:54.280]  which they've already done.
[56:54.280 --> 56:55.280]  That's the breaking news.
[56:55.280 --> 56:56.280]  And just everything else.
[56:56.280 --> 57:00.280]  And see, by the time they, by the time they get to the real censorship,
[57:00.280 --> 57:05.280]  the real extermination of freedom,
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.280]  it's just laissez faire a lot because you've already gotten yourself ready to accept that.
[57:10.280 --> 57:13.280]  And so see, by the time you've done that,
[57:13.280 --> 57:15.280]  oh, it's like think progress is being banned.
[57:15.280 --> 57:17.280]  Well, okay, that's all right too.
[57:17.280 --> 57:23.280]  You know, as long as the good old neocon boys over at the CIA do it,
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.280]  as long as, you know, because nobody reads the weekly standard, everybody hates them.
[57:27.280 --> 57:28.280]  So what's the power structure to do?
[57:28.280 --> 57:31.280]  Oh, put them in charge of censoring the left.
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.280]  And the left won't defend the right, the right won't defend the left,
[57:34.280 --> 57:35.280]  and then it's game over.
[57:35.280 --> 57:37.280]  Well, that's not the truth.
[57:37.280 --> 57:42.280]  We're winning big red, red waves coming, but folks have to really realize we're two minutes to midnight.
[57:42.280 --> 57:44.280]  And now is the time to get on your knees to Jesus.
[57:44.280 --> 58:13.280]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[58:14.280 --> 58:16.280]  We'll be right back with a second hour.
[58:44.280 --> 58:47.280]  InfowarsLife.com
[59:15.280 --> 59:17.280]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[59:17.280 --> 59:22.280]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter
[59:22.280 --> 59:26.280]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us
[59:26.280 --> 59:30.280]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[59:30.280 --> 59:36.280]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[59:36.280 --> 59:38.280]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to,
[59:38.280 --> 59:45.280]  but the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[59:45.280 --> 01:00:14.280]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:23.280]  So about five months ago, the EU introduced legislation to ban memes, seriously,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.280]  because their AI can't scan it, it doesn't get humor, so they can't censor it.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.280]  And so they go, oh, it's copyright, it's got to be reviewed by the EU,
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:34.280]  or there's multi-million euro fines.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.280]  And then now they passed it.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.280]  So the first media said, oh, it'll never happen.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.280]  Now, of course, it's happened.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:47.280]  The EU killing legislation that is designed to destroy the Internet
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.280]  here is part of the report from John Bow.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:53.280]  EU Parliament recently put the Internet, at least in Europe,
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.280]  on a path towards certain corporate Orwellian doom.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.280]  This discussion is bedeviled by all sorts of artificial media,
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280]  twist storms and hysteria of one kind or another.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:09.280]  There's a very good argument against the lack of democracy in the EU.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.280]  Isn't it funny?
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:13.280]  You know, when I came here 17 years ago,
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:20.280]  and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union,
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.280]  you all laughed at me.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.280]  Well, I have to say, you're not laughing now, are you?
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.280]  The main reason the United Kingdom voted the way that it did
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.280]  is you have, by stealth, by deception, without ever telling the truth
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.280]  to the British or the rest of the peoples of Europe,
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.280]  you have imposed upon them a political union.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.280]  Article 11, also known as the link tax,
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:54.280]  forces anyone linking an article of more than one word to a news story
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.280]  to pay for a service that licenses the article.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:03.280]  That news site can, according to The Verge, charge anything they want
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.280]  to write to quote them or refuse to sell altogether,
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.280]  effectively giving them the right to choose who can criticize them.
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:15.280]  While Article 13, also known as the upload filter,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:21.280]  requires all but the smallest platforms will have to defensively adopt copyright filters
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:28.280]  that examine everything you post and censor anything judged to be a copyright infringement,
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  according to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.280]  And if that wasn't enough to bring the free flow of information to a grinding halt,
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:40.280]  typical social media posts like a selfie taken at a football game
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.280]  have been targeted by Article 12A.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.280]  No posting your own photos or videos of sports matches,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.280]  only the organizers of sports matches will have the right
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280]  to publicly post any kind of record of the match.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.280]  No posting your selfies or short videos of exciting plays.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280]  You are the audience. Your job is to sit where you're told.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.280]  Passively watch the game and go home, according to the EFF.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.280]  Also, a freedom of panorama exemption wasn't accepted.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.280]  For example, if you take a selfie on a busy street
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.280]  and licensed material happens to be in your shot,
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  whether it's a t-shirt, a licensed architectural design,
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.280]  aka a building or a billboard, you will be infringing on a copyright.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280]  Also not covered.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.280]  Anything we regard in America as fair use,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.280]  no user-generated content exemption,
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.280]  which would have made EU states carve out an exception to copyright
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:47.280]  for using excerpts from works for criticism, review, illustration,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.280]  caricature, parody or pastiche.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.280]  EU Army to increase ranks seven-fold.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.280]  I remember 10 years ago saying there's a secret plan for an EU Army
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.280]  because it had actually come out in documents.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.280]  We'd actually gotten documents from someone inside Bilderberg.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:10.280]  They were discussing an EU Army to stop countries from having their own borders.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.280]  They were going to flood Europe with North Africans and Islamists
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280]  outside of the Middle East.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280]  It's all true. It all happened.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  Of course, it was real documents we got.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280]  Then a guy who works at the National Archives
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.280]  brought me secret Bilderberg documents the next year confirming it all.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.280]  We published them all.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.280]  I did get that threat.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.280]  Now, but Junker, when you look at the unelected head of the EU
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.280]  that anyone didn't vote to enter, but they're in the UK,
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.280]  he is the grandson. His father was a top Nazi.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:42.280]  His grandfather was the richest guy in Germany.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.280]  All right, folks, we'll be back.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.280]  The full John Bowne report is on infowars.com,
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.280]  EU internet killing legislation.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:50.280]  It's really important.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.280]  We'll be back with Eric Boling confronted with 9-Eleven Truths.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.280]  Stay with us.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.280]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways,
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:30.280]  including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.280]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism,
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.280]  helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:39.280]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.280]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.280]  that contains unmodified high-quality krill oil concentrate
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.280]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.280]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil,
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.280]  now available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.280]  Good friends with Trump now with CRTV.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.280]  We had Eric Boling in studio.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.280]  He was going to come on about the economy
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.280]  and about how Trump's ideology is making America great,
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.280]  standing up to big corporate bullies.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.280]  Instead of the media saying he has no soul,
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:41.280]  but Boling wanted a virtue signal to the mainstream media
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:43.280]  and say, aren't you all right?
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.280]  They're racist.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.280]  And I'm like, that's a Hillary Clinton talking point.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.280]  And oh, you think the government did 9-Eleven?
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.280]  And I'm like, yeah, the 28 pages,
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.280]  criminal elements of our government ally with Saudi Arabia stood down.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280]  I've had Senator Paul on.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.280]  I've had Congressman Jones on.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.280]  I've had former deputy directors
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.280]  and former heads of SCIOP of the CIA on.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.280]  This is a well-known animal.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.280]  Doesn't mean radical Islam doesn't exist.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:14.280]  And he just was like, no, I can't believe it.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.280]  There were real people down there.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.280]  Yeah, we know real people died.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.280]  All I'm saying is if you go look at the evidence of Building 7
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.280]  or a BBC and CNN reporting,
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:30.280]  they were going to blow up Building 7, 47-story building.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.280]  That happened later.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.280]  They said it never happened.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.280]  So the point is it needs to be investigated.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.280]  And it turns out within days of the event on three different shows,
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:45.280]  then real estate mogul, now President Trump,
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.280]  said he thought there were bombs in the buildings and his engineer
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:50.280]  who helped build the World Trade Center,
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280]  thought that.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.280]  So Bowling was here and I would mention this.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.280]  He goes, oh, you don't have the clip, you know,
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]  you know, I don't want to just hear it.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]  Well, guess what?
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.280]  Now we have the clips and here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.280]  Here is the report.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:08.280]  I get blamed for every conspiracy theory.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.280]  There's some crazy person made up.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.280]  I said, I do not agree with you that the US government,
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.280]  someone inside the government had knowledge of the terror attack
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280]  prior to the attack.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.280]  Oh, really?
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.280]  All over Twitter yesterday, Mainline left his site,
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280]  celebrated and said America deserved it.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.280]  Reality winner had a top secret security clearance
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]  and was helping ISIS.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.280]  There are some, the average professor at UT down the street
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.280]  loves 9-11 and says America deserved it.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:36.280]  There were elements in our government ally with radical Islam
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.280]  that helped them carry out the attack.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.280]  Just like the character covering up New Mexico.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  You can argue whether or not America deserved it or not.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.280]  I don't think America deserved it.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.280]  I'm saying the left is cheerleading it.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:49.280]  It wasn't your theory, Alice.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.280]  Your theory was not only did America not deserve it,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280]  but the United States government knew about the attack
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280]  prior to the attack and decided to stand out.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.280]  A very different theory.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.280]  I don't want to spend all our time on 9-11.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  It's not that I'm running away from it.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.280]  It's that the media misrepresent what I say about it.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.280]  I believe Islamic terror and radical Islam
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  is one of the number one threats on the planet,
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:07.280]  probably number one.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:10.280]  I know that there are criminals in our government like Brennan
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.280]  who reportedly converted to Wahhabism.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.280]  Obama helped launch the Arab Spring
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.280]  to overthrow our allies in Egypt.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:18.280]  You name it.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.280]  And I think that elements let this happen,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.280]  like PNAC, wrote to let there be an attack
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.280]  to end up taking our liberties away.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.280]  And I've got FBI was warned about flight schools.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.280]  That's CBS News.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:33.280]  FBI knew Al Qaeda polished training in U.S. order to stand down.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280]  ABC News.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.280]  The State Department lapses, aided 9-11 hijackers
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.280]  and they have the airlifts of evil.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  Flight tens of thousands of Al Qaeda fighters out.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.280]  Our military was ordered to do it.
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280]  I don't blame our military.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.280]  I was like, oh yeah, our military.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.280]  No, I love our military.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.280]  The Bin Laden family was whisked out in the United States
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:51.280]  by President Bush himself right after the 9-11 attack.
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.280]  And they went back to Saudi Arabia, correct?
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280]  That's right.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.280]  When you had the World Trade Center go,
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.280]  people were put into planes that were friends, family,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.280]  girlfriends, and they were put into planes
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.280]  and they were sent back for the most part to Saudi Arabia.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.280]  All I'm saying is there is a radical Islamic alliance
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.280]  with the left and there are people in the government
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.280]  working to protect Islam.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  They got this imam that's connected to dozens of bombings.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.280]  After six months, he's been released from British prison
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]  next week.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:22.280]  You said some things that I agree with.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.280]  I believe radical Islam is the greatest threat
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.280]  to the United States, our freedom, maybe even the globe.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280]  I'll agree with that.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:29.280]  Maybe the left's bigger, though.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.280]  Well, I think the left is a different type of threat
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  and it's a longer term threat where radical Islam
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280]  could kill a lot of people real fast
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.280]  and the left is going to take a while for them to take over
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.280]  and take away our liberties and freedoms.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.280]  But I think we can deal with a straight on attack
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  like radical Islam.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.280]  It's the left creeping around.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280]  I don't like them either.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280]  I'm on board with that.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280]  Well, this is video on screen of them saying
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.280]  Building 7 has already fallen.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.280]  Have you seen that video?
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.280]  No.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.280]  And it's right behind her.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.280]  I can't hear her.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.280]  Can we apply for it?
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280]  What?
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.280]  I'd like to hear her say it's already fallen.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:06.280]  And by the way, Alex, anyone could throw a video,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.280]  the picture behind it, the news press.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280]  That could be true.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280]  Well, she said Building 7 has fallen.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.280]  They put the story out beforehand.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:16.280]  Now, more on the latest building collapse in New York.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280]  You might have heard a few moments ago.
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.280]  I was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.280]  And indeed, it has.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.280]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.280]  building and its collapse?
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280]  Well, only really what you already know.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.280]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:33.280]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings,
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:36.280]  Building 7 in the World Trade Center complex,
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:39.280]  is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.280]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.280]  It's just pancake.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.280]  Well, pancaking almost like a precision enclosure.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280]  It's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.280]  too much on television before
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  when a building was delivered to the store
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:00.280]  destroyed by world-class dynamite at Mount Japan.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.280]  Donald Trump is on the line.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  We know him as the man behind lots of real estate in Manhattan.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.280]  And of course, Donald, I understand you were actually
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.280]  a witness to what happened this morning.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:19.280]  Well, I have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.280]  And I saw this huge explosion.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.280]  I was with a group of people.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  You really couldn't even believe it.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.280]  And even, I think, worse than that,
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.280]  for years I've looked right directly at the building.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.280]  I'd see the Empire State Building in the foreground
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.280]  and the World Trade Center in the background.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.280]  And now I'm looking at absolutely nothing.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.280]  It's just gone.
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.280]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.280]  as a very, very strong building.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.280]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.280]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.280]  because that's your foundation.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.280]  This was an unbelievably powerful building.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.280]  If you know anything about structure,
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.280]  one of the first buildings that was built from the outside,
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  the steel, the reason the World Trade Center
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.280]  you had the steel on the outside.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.280]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy I-beams,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.280]  when I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.280]  because there was a hole in the steel.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.280]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.280]  of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.280]  I think, you know, if you were ever up there,
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.280]  they were quite narrow.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.280]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:23.280]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane,
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.280]  even a 767 or 747 or whatever it might have been,
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280]  how could it possibly go through the steel?
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.280]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane,
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.280]  but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.280]  because I just can't imagine anything being able
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  to go through that wall.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.280]  Most buildings are built with the steel
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.280]  as on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.280]  This one was built from the outside,
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.280]  which is the strongest structure you can have,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  and it was almost just like a can of soup.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:52.280]  I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.280]  I think it just seemed to me that to do that kind
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.280]  of destruction is even more than a big plane
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.280]  because you're talking about taking out steel,
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  the heaviest caliber steel that was used on a building.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.280]  I mean, these buildings were rock solid.
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:10.280]  So I said the exact same things back at the time.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.280]  It was on local news that were bombs in the buildings.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280]  And the media would say,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.280]  Jones says the fire department blew it up,
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.280]  or Jones says the military did, never said that.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  I said, I saw the news.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  I heard the news.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.280]  They said they blew it up.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  And then you had John O'Neill,
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:38.280]  the deputy head of the FBI quit a month before 9-11.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.280]  And he came out and said,
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.280]  we're going to let Al Qaeda attack us.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:45.280]  Al Qaeda has infiltrated our government.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.280]  And it's wrong what happened and we need to expose it.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.280]  And then he died.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.280]  His first day at work was 9-11
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.280]  as the head of security at the World Trade Center.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.280]  And I've got the footage of the local police saying,
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280]  get back.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.280]  They're going to blow it up.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.280]  Doesn't mean the police are involved.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.280]  I've talked to cops that were there during the 10-second countdown.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280]  But don't just have that.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.280]  I found the cops who were on PBS getting the countdown
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.280]  for Building 7.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.280]  And they blew up other buildings too.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.280]  And all the chaos they're told, oh,
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280]  we're going to protect these buildings.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.280]  It takes days, if not weeks, to wire these buildings.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.280]  Do I know what happened?
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.280]  No, I don't.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.280]  Just like President Trump doesn't.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.280]  I covered it.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:23.280]  I was on air.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.280]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.280]  Now, Eric Boling said, hey, show me the clips.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:29.280]  Eric, we just showed you the clips.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.280]  So this is a live show.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.280]  But later, we'll cut this out.
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280]  We'll archive it.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  TemphalWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.280]  Our own video feeds.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.280]  We're censored on YouTube.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.280]  We'll send this out to Eric Boling.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.280]  But you aren't banned from YouTube.
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.280]  You can upload this segment to YouTube.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.280]  And I hope you do.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.280]  Don't forget TemphalWars.com.

[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.280]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.280]  What we are sure to provide them for ourselves,
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.280]  it's just as important to make sure your kids
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.280]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.280]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula

[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280]  and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280]  to boost your child's mind and body.

[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280]  which has been shown to be essential
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.280]  for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.280]  Built on powerful ingredients

[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.280]  Years ago, InfowarsLife created
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.280]  the powerful MycoZX formula
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.280]  to help you combat internal yeast
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.280]  as the years went on,
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.280]  and more toxins were pumped into the environment.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280]  Our team knew we had to create a bigger
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:13.280]  and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.280]  A unique natural formula
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280]  and fungal organisms,
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.280]  there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.280]  MycoZX Plus helps support

[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280]  supports your digestive tract,
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.280]  and addresses the intestinal yeast
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.280]  that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.280]  InfowarsLife is used by an impressive list of ingredients,
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.280]  including grapefruit seed extract,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.280]  poudarco bark, and grape seed extract.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.280]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.280]  that stood the test of time

[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.280]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.280]  Introducing pollen block.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.280]  It's a primary new, natural way
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280]  to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.280]  including promoting clear nasal
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.280]  and sinus passageways,
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.280]  eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.280]  In the 1960s,
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280]  researchers in France noticed
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.280]  that people who ate certain quail eggs
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:21.280]  experienced less seasonal immune
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.280]  and inflammatory responses.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.280]  They began studying this effect in published trials,
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.280]  and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research,

[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.280]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.280]  In fact, current research has found
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.280]  that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:48.280]  and inflammatory responses in the body.

[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280]  floral life, as well as MycoZX
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280]  that targets the yeast, the mold,
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.280]  and the funguses and the gut.
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.280]  So this is the time to take advantage
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  of getting this new incredible fiber product

[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.280]  and make really, really big savings
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.280]  and get high-quality products at the same time.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.280]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.280]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.280]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.280]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.280]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:54.280]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  That's all for today. InfoWarsLife.com
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.280]  We're ahead of the Trump campaign.
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.280]  Muller, Sharks circling him.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.280]  Manafort agreeing to plea bargain,
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.280]  but not on Russiagate on tax evasion
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]  15 years ago.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.280]  But everybody is ready to blow their brains
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.280]  out of there about Russiagate.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.280]  The reason Roger's here is to get into
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.280]  Matt Drudge, who's got a smart
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.280]  political brain on the shoulders.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.280]  Warns of midterm bloodblath.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.280]  Trump to lose 60 seats
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.280]  of the house like Obama did on less.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.280]  But he cryptically didn't say
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.280]  what unless meant.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280]  And then, California
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.280]  professor, writer
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280]  of controversial Brett Kavanaugh letter
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280]  speaks out about her allegation
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.280]  of sexual assault.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.280]  Never told anybody till 2012,
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.280]  and she just said a group of frat boys
[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.280]  were drunk and jumped on top of me
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.280]  for a few seconds in a bed.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.280]  I think a group of frat boys
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280]  beat me up a couple of times,
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.280]  but actually it was Brett.
[01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.280]  In fact, I'm not a secret source.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.280]  Brett Kavanaugh
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.280]  in 1986 came to Dallas,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.280]  Texas, and I was
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.280]  in high school and he raped me.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.280]  No, I'm serious.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.280]  He came in the room, it was him.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280]  He punched me right in the nose, and he raped me.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.280]  And that's it.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.280]  He can't be confirmed. In fact,
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.280]  he then
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.280]  opened up a black suitcase
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:44.280]  and 14 Kibler elves came out.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.280]  You're thinking, hey, they're not scary,
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.280]  they're a little. Listen,
[01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.280]  they were dangerous.
[01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.280]  They tied me down like little apputians
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.280]  in Gulliver's Travels
[01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.280]  and they
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.280]  they made me take DMT
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.280]  and PCP.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.280]  And then, once I was doing that,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.280]  Barack Obama flew in
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.280]  like a little winged pig
[01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.280]  and landed at the foot of my bed.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.280]  No, I'm being sarcastic here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.280]  I could say
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.280]  secret source says that
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.280]  Hillary Clinton
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.280]  tells the truth
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.280]  and you know it was a lie.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.280]  At least Anita Hill worked
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:26.280]  for Clarence Thomas.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.280]  But then they all the witnesses
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.280]  of her throwing herself at him.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.280]  And then it never happened.
[01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.280]  So we're going to get into that
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.280]  with Roger before we end this segment
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:38.280]  as well. But Roger
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:40.280]  the big inch a lot of first Joe Biden
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.280]  and maybe we should keep the first 20 seconds
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.280]  of that club says that
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.280]  Trump supports the dregs of society.
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.280]  So if deplorables hurt Hillary
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.280]  this has got to hurt Joe Biden.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.280]  Yeah, I mean, Joe Biden
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.280]  is the world's class
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.280]  example of elitism.
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.280]  He lives in Greenville, Delaware,
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.280]  the wealthiest part of town.
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.280]  And he tries to pass himself off
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.280]  as just good old regular Joe.
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.280]  You know, this is a guy
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:10.280]  whose son Hunter
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.280]  got extraordinarily
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.280]  lucrative business deals
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280]  out of both Ukraine
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.280]  and China in the
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.280]  immediate aftermath of his
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.280]  visiting both countries with his
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.280]  vice presidential father.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.280]  You want to talk about collusion?
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.280]  I mean, Joe Biden is
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.280]  is about as tone deaf
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.280]  as you can get.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.280]  And this constant
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.280]  disparagement of Donald
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.280]  Trump supporters because they're working
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.280]  class people because they didn't
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.280]  go to Harvard
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.280]  or Yale is really
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.280]  part and parcel of the
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.280]  elitism of the Democratic
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.280]  party and people like Biden.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.280]  More importantly though,
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.280]  why he can't keep his hands off of children
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:56.280]  I just don't understand.
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:58.280]  Oh, there's hours of video, but that doesn't
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:00.280]  matter because Brett Kavanaugh rate me.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.280]  Seriously, I'm gonna put the headline out.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.280]  Did you know he rate me?
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.280]  This whole thing, this is a woman looking
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.280]  for her Anita
[01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.280]  Hill moment.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:12.280]  You know, this is her
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.280]  15 minutes. Joe
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.280]  Biden is really one
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:18.280]  creepy guy.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:20.280]  It's interesting because when I was in
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.280]  Rehoboth Beach, Delaware last week,
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.280]  Joe trolls up and down Rehoboth
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:26.280]  Avenue looking for
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.280]  adoration. He wants people
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.280]  to adore him. He has in the back of his
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.280]  mind that he's a Kennedy.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.280]  Whereas in truth,
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.280]  every single foreign policy issue
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.280]  he dealt with as chairman of the
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.280]  Senate Intelligence, Senate
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.280]  Foreign Policy Committee, he was wrong.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.280]  No, no, he had a terrible job, but just
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.280]  getting back to
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.280]  this liberal professor
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.280]  had said that once at a party
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  in high school, some drunk guys
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.280]  jumped on her for five seconds
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.280]  and then that was it.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.280]  And then now she says it's Kavanaugh.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.280]  Well, I want to be clear.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.280]  Kavanaugh rate me.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280]  It's about as credible.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  I mean, first of all, what evidence
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.280]  does this woman produce?
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.280]  Is there another witness to this
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.280]  alleged assault?
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  This is a last-ditch
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.280]  desperation attempt
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.280]  to derail what is almost certainly
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.280]  going to be another conservative
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  Supreme Court justice racked up by
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280]  Donald. I was about to say, I mean, this is the most
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.280]  classic thing ever where you just get
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.280]  any leftist out of millions of people
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.280]  just to make something up
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  and then to get your husband to say, oh, yeah, she told
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.280]  me about it six years ago and then it's a
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.280]  done deal. This is crazy.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.280]  Well, and the performance
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.280]  of Cory Booker
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280]  really takes the cake. I'll be honest with you.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.280]  I was working on a book on Cory
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.280]  Booker called The Moth.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.280]  That's a name given
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.280]  to him by Governor Chris Christie because
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.280]  like a moth, he flies
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.280]  to every controversy
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.280]  with the press release, but he never actually
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.280]  does anything.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.280]  Cory Booker is an incredibly corrupt
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.280]  public servant and
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.280]  I have a book coming out shortly
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.280]  on Cory Booker that will expose all of
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.280]  that. I was ready to leave him alone
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.280]  because he's a non-entity and
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.280]  he's not going to be president, but now
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.280]  I think I have no choice.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.280]  Well, let's go to that last point, though.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:18.280]  What do you make of drugs saying we
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.280]  can lose 60 seats? Well, just because
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.280]  the polls showed Obama at the same point
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.280]  two years in as Trump, those are fake polls.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:26.280]  Plus, there's this, the Trump
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.280]  secret that a lot of folks that want to admit they support
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.280]  Trump. Now they have the illegal
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:32.280]  and the dead people voting. That's their secret.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.280]  That's why we still have a chance of losing
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.280]  but only because of election fraud.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.280]  Well, I've got to tell you, Alex, I'm more
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.280]  with
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.280]  that drudge on this
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.280]  including, importantly, the word
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:46.280]  unless. The president
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.280]  has not framed this election.
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.280]  He's too busy
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.280]  dickering with the New York Times over their
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:54.280]  phony, anonymous op-ed.
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.280]  He's too busy fighting over.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.280]  No, I agree. He seems to stop giving their distractions
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.280]  attention. So what is the unless?
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.280]  What does President Trump need to do
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.280]  right now? He needs to say they're trying to overturn
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.280]  the election. They're trying to kill the recovery.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.280]  They're the ones in league with the Russians and others.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.280]  They're out of the radical Islam.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.280]  They're the frauds. He needs to get on the super
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  offense and stir Republicans up into the same,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.280]  right?
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.280]  Declassify all of the information
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  pertaining
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.280]  to the FISA warrant. The way
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  Mr. The Phony Russian collusion
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.280]  fraud
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.280]  is to show who was cheating in 2016.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.280]  It wasn't Donald Trump and the Republicans.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.280]  It was Hillary Clinton
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.280]  and the Obama Justice Department
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:36.280]  and FBI. Mr. President,
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.280]  we implore you
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.280]  declassify the information
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:42.280]  pertaining to the FISA
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.280]  wards. When your advisors say
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:46.280]  we can't do that, sir, it's a matter of
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.280]  national security, that's a lie.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.280]  A damnable lie.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  Well, the matter of national security is not letting
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.280]  this rogue group of angry Democrats
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.280]  overturn the election of the American people
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280]  and kill our recovery. He's got to
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.280]  release it now. They're not going to stop.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.280]  Right. Two messages for the election.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.280]  One, talk about the economic
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.280]  recovery and how great it is because
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  the mainstream media will not talk about
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  that, even though I think people are feeling it.
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.280]  And two, get the Democrats
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.280]  on defense by declassifying
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.280]  all of the information
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:18.280]  pertaining to the spying
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  on Donald Trump's campaign.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.280]  Yeah, he says he won't fire sessions
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.280]  after the election. I think that's a mistake.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280]  Well, I agree, but we're probably past
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.280]  that now. So, talk
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.280]  about the economy and declassify
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:32.280]  the spying information
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.280]  and you will change the whole
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280]  scope of this election. And the other
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.280]  unless is this, Roger,
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.280]  all of us got to get people to vote. We got to
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.280]  be politically active. We can't be asleep
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.280]  thinking this thing is one because they got a bunch of dead people
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:46.280]  and a bunch of illegal aliens
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.280]  set to vote and made your election fraud
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:50.280]  with half the machines
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.280]  owned by George Soros. NewsWars.com

[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:24.280]  We're going to talk about
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.280]  some of the important superfoods
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.280]  and crucial compounds. Ultimate bone broth

[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.280]  X2
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:00.280]  we were selling it for about three years
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.280]  and then they found out how big it was
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.280]  and how much we were buying and they said
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.280]  oh we want more money, more money, and oh this and that
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:08.280]  and so I've broken my contract
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.280]  and right now we can't get more of this
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.280]  proprietary ingredient that goes in X2
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:14.280]  that literally is so pure that
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.280]  if you put in a peaker dish on top of 90 degree
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.280]  hot plate it gasses
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:20.280]  like I dream of genie and there's this purple gas
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:22.280]  I mean that is so pure it just goes right
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:24.280]  into your body when you take it. We're working
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.280]  on trying to get other suppliers right now but
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.280]  I bought a huge amount of it
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.280]  ordered it six months ago
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.280]  so I get the price down and I said
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.280]  if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.280]  well I broke the contract last week
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.280]  and so this is potentially
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.280]  the last run, in fact right now it is the last run
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.280]  of Survival Shield X2
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.280]  and we've got a good supply
