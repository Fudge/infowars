[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:44.840]  We are watching the organized degeneration and collapse of the human community as it
[00:44.840 --> 00:54.600]  has existed for thousands of years upon this small planet. And the social engineers believe
[00:54.600 --> 00:59.200]  they have a method to their madness that they're going to channel the collapse of society and
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.960]  even augment it so that they can consolidate control.
[01:02.960 --> 01:14.840]  But it's clear that they are not escaping the blowback from their intensification of
[01:14.840 --> 01:22.180]  worldwide problems. We're going to be live here for the next three hours on this live
[01:22.180 --> 01:33.080]  Monday edition. When Max Keiser was in studio with us, a week and a half ago in London,
[01:33.080 --> 01:38.040]  there in my hotel room from our makeshift studio, he said, see, this is the collapse
[01:38.040 --> 01:41.900]  that I was talking about, but it's coming a month and a half after I said it would.
[01:41.900 --> 01:47.760]  He said late April, now it's mid June. And he said that in early June. In fact, the day
[01:47.760 --> 01:52.720]  Bilderberg kicked off on June 6th. And then I was sitting there for about an hour this
[01:52.720 --> 01:59.760]  morning watching CNBC just to see what they were telegraphing to the public. They always
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.680]  tell you things a long time after it's basically already been set up.
[02:04.680 --> 02:11.680]  And they were saying that the Fed will slowly start cutting off QE infinity. So I guess
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.920]  that takes the infinity out of it. And that that's why the stock market's down the last
[02:16.920 --> 02:22.280]  few weeks and why the dollar and other currencies have been dropping. And inflation is marked
[02:22.280 --> 02:28.440]  everywhere. I don't care what fake inflation numbers they put out in the newspaper, we
[02:28.440 --> 02:33.440]  all know inflation's up everywhere.
[02:33.440 --> 02:37.800]  And so we're gonna be breaking that down with Max Keiser when he joins us from London, that's
[02:37.800 --> 02:47.880]  where he lives in the second hour. In the meantime, here's some of the other headlines
[02:47.880 --> 02:56.200]  up on infowars.com. Journalists TSA shamed my teenage daughter. That's the plan, break
[02:56.200 --> 02:59.800]  your will, train you that you're a slave, set the precedent.
[02:59.800 --> 03:08.720]  Russian Tycoon predicts immortality within 25 years. That's what they're going for, doesn't
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.880]  mean they're going to get it. 14-year-old faces here in jail over pro-gun t-shirt. They
[03:14.880 --> 03:19.400]  say the shirt is terroristic threat. It's an NRA, defend your rights is what the shirt
[03:19.400 --> 03:20.520]  says.
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.920]  How evil, how un-American than to defend your rights. The next NSA snooping shoe to drop,
[03:25.920 --> 03:30.440]  free crime, artificial intelligence. I've been telling you that for 15 years, now that's
[03:30.440 --> 03:36.640]  mainstream news. In fact, I have a case of a guy on Twitter, well-known writer, said
[03:36.640 --> 03:37.960]  nothing threatening to Obama.
[03:37.960 --> 03:42.840]  Secret Service came, intimidated him into signing a release to get his mental records.
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.560]  And the guy went along with it, I'm gonna get him on the show. But I mean, show up here
[03:47.560 --> 03:53.480]  and try to make me sign something and you're going to be told to go to North Korea, which
[03:53.480 --> 03:59.080]  might as well be hell. So I know you're trying to make it hell, but we're trying as best
[03:59.080 --> 04:00.880]  we can to stop that.
[04:00.880 --> 04:06.000]  I mean, I really care about the future. I really care about my children. I really care
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.660]  about your children. California's put it on the books, they can have 1,000 times the Roundup
[04:13.660 --> 04:24.080]  Ready chemical glyphosate in your water. You understand at 1 one thousandths of that level,
[04:24.080 --> 04:28.600]  it massively increases cancer across the board in major studies. We're going to be getting
[04:28.600 --> 04:33.880]  to that.
[04:33.880 --> 04:40.200]  Now just think about it, they're killing us. And all the uppies will do is laugh about
[04:40.200 --> 04:48.680]  it even as they're dying. It's like it's fun. It's fun. It's fun. We'll be right back, ladies
[04:48.680 --> 04:54.720]  and gentlemen, with the latest on the establishments, plunging poll numbers, the economy, what's
[04:54.720 --> 05:00.240]  happening with Saudi Arabia, giving missiles to Al Qaeda and more.

[07:00.800 --> 07:06.400]  alone, the U. S. Has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged
[07:06.400 --> 07:11.320]  across the U. S. Costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest
[07:11.320 --> 07:15.880]  drought in the country. In more than 50 years, you may think out of sight out of mind and
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.800]  so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages

[08:03.520 --> 08:33.440]  the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. Ladies and gentlemen,
[08:33.440 --> 08:47.720]  it is Monday, the 17th day of June 2013. And this is just out via the London Guardian Snowden.
[08:47.720 --> 08:56.360]  The truth is coming and the government can't even stop it by murdering me. Avoiding a specific
[08:56.360 --> 09:01.640]  question on the scope of documents he obtained about the National Security Agency's surveillance
[09:01.640 --> 09:09.560]  program. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden suggested Monday that he believes the federal
[09:09.560 --> 09:13.160]  government wants to either jail him or murder him.
[09:13.160 --> 09:16.320]  Well, yeah, that's been in the news that they've been bragging about killing him because it's
[09:16.320 --> 09:22.560]  not the US government. It is a foreign mafia. Yeah, put that back up on screen for me. Business
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.360]  Insider is also reporting that he has been doing a live chat with a bunch of newspapers
[09:28.360 --> 09:39.880]  for the last two hours and answering their questions. So we'll be going over more of
[09:39.880 --> 09:40.880]  that today.
[09:40.880 --> 09:46.820]  Also, Supreme Court strikes down Arizona voting rules saying you don't have to show an ID
[09:46.820 --> 09:51.440]  that you're a US citizen. You don't have to show a driver's license, nothing. So the government
[09:51.440 --> 10:03.000]  spies on everything you do. But when you go to vote, you don't have to show any ID that
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.040]  you're even who you say you are.
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.840]  And the Democratic Party particularly has been caught in all 50 states engaged in retail
[10:10.840 --> 10:18.560]  voter fraud. People voting over and over again, illegals voting. If I went to Mexico and wanted
[10:18.560 --> 10:27.440]  to go vote in their election, they would wanna see my driver's license or consul matriculum.
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.520]  That's my whole thing about this amnesty. We talk about Mexico cuz that's about 80%
[10:31.520 --> 10:36.760]  of the people that are coming here. I can't go to Mexico with my wife pregnant, walk in,
[10:36.760 --> 10:42.520]  have the baby, have it all paid for and my kid is a citizen.
[10:42.520 --> 10:47.440]  If I'm caught illegally in Mexico, I'm gonna spend six months hard labor, that's on record.
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.680]  Now I'm not saying do that to illegal aliens here, but the sense of hospitality in America
[10:52.680 --> 11:00.600]  is what's going to destroy us. And the sense of groveling to government as well. Groveling
[11:00.600 --> 11:03.040]  to uniforms, groveling to fake authority.
[11:03.040 --> 11:08.800]  And that's why they're putting code enforcers and bureaucrats in uniforms now, because the
[11:08.800 --> 11:16.880]  average American falls on their knees. I might do a test where I'd dress up like a king and
[11:16.880 --> 11:21.720]  walk around the street and tell people to bow, they probably will. I know if I put on
[11:21.720 --> 11:25.360]  a third world dictator uniform, they would.
[11:25.360 --> 11:32.460]  And it's comical when some militia person dresses up in a general outfit. Remember,
[11:32.460 --> 11:35.840]  some of the Republic of Texas, not the whole Republic of Texas, but some of them. We go
[11:35.840 --> 11:40.000]  have rallies, there'd be like ten guys, they were all generals. One guy's an admiral cuz
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.560]  he's got a bass boat.
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.840]  They'd have like four stars on their shoulder in an army uniform redone, an army dress uniform.
[11:46.840 --> 11:53.800]  And one guy would have a marine dress uniform. And they would announce I am the president
[11:53.800 --> 11:59.800]  because out at our farm, my cousins voted me in as the president of the Republic of
[11:59.800 --> 12:09.320]  Texas. Sam Houston got voted in an election to be the president after he won the war guys.
[12:09.320 --> 12:18.400]  You don't just skip all that and become president. And all he did was wear an insignia on his
[12:18.400 --> 12:26.440]  hat as the head of the Texas forces. And government's the same way. The Queen of England dressed
[12:26.440 --> 12:30.880]  up in a clown suit with a big crown is utterly ridiculous.
[12:30.880 --> 12:36.880]  Just like you look at some native in Africa or Latin America today, down in Brazil, wearing
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.060]  a big headdress and everyone's bowing down to them. And they're real proud to the explorers
[12:41.060 --> 12:45.240]  and expect you to bow down because they've got a shrunken head hanging around their neck
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.520]  and a big feather headdress.
[12:49.520 --> 12:54.440]  Or if you go to New Guinea or something and visit the headhunters there, it's comical
[12:54.440 --> 13:01.240]  if you're an anthropologist, they're visiting with them. And it's comical, the police uniforms,
[13:01.240 --> 13:08.360]  the red carpets, the jumbo jets, the Air Force One, and thousands of other aircraft used
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.720]  by the federal government as generals and Congress people fly around like royalty.
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.840]  It is a giant corrupt group of con artists and criminals festooning themselves in dark
[13:20.840 --> 13:27.200]  suits, festooning themselves in red carpets and award ceremonies and titles, all with
[13:27.200 --> 13:37.880]  a bunch of inch deep, mile wide narcissist, totally unhappy, all dishonorable, completely
[13:37.880 --> 13:47.440]  cowardly, vapid, and not even alive.
[13:47.440 --> 13:51.140]  And that's why if you're watching me on TV today, not just listening on the radio, radio
[13:51.140 --> 13:57.320]  listeners can go to infoawars.com forward slash show. We now offer the daytime radio
[13:57.320 --> 14:03.520]  show for everybody as a service against the new world order at infoawars.com forward slash
[14:03.520 --> 14:04.780]  show.
[14:04.780 --> 14:09.040]  The archives of all the films, the high def version of the show, the nightly news, everything
[14:09.040 --> 14:17.780]  else is on prisonplanet.tv. But if you go there, you'll notice that I am wearing a black
[14:17.780 --> 14:24.440]  sports jacket and a camouflage dress shirt. And I did that just to illustrate this point
[14:24.440 --> 14:36.880]  today, that everybody looks at the surface of things.
[14:36.880 --> 14:45.180]  Does someone have a short haircut? Is someone thin? Does someone have a wrecked posture?
[14:45.180 --> 14:52.600]  Are they wearing a nice jacket? Is the cut of the jacket well done, the tailoring? Does
[14:52.600 --> 14:59.860]  the shirt look clean and properly starched? Is the tie well appointed?
[14:59.860 --> 15:05.720]  And then off of that, and they've done criminology studies where women will get in the car with
[15:05.720 --> 15:11.700]  a sharp dressed man, even though he's a serial killer, or the person is doing a criminology
[15:11.700 --> 15:19.800]  test playing the part of a serial killer. But if you put a billionaire in a dirty t-shirt
[15:19.800 --> 15:22.580]  and shorts, no one will get in the car with him.
[15:22.580 --> 15:31.240]  And as a society, we have gotten in the car with predatory, out of control parasites who
[15:31.240 --> 15:36.660]  don't just not care about us, they hate us. And I'm gonna get into some of that today
[15:36.660 --> 15:44.400]  to understand why we've gotten to this point. And so now on the video of this, it'll undoubtedly
[15:44.400 --> 15:47.700]  get posted on YouTube and Daily Motion and everywhere.
[15:47.700 --> 15:52.640]  You will see the majority of the comments, even though I've explained all this, about
[15:52.640 --> 16:02.020]  is it good fashion taste to wear a camouflage shirt with a black sports jacket? Just like
[16:02.020 --> 16:07.140]  if I, as you dig around under my desk here, I think there's a container right there with
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.740]  some of my sunglasses.
[16:09.740 --> 16:15.220]  Thank you. If I was to put sunglasses on on top of it, people would all tune in and ask,
[16:15.220 --> 16:22.340]  why is he wearing sunglasses? See, everything is about surface. Everything is about what
[16:22.340 --> 16:31.420]  is on the surface, and that's how it is. That's how it is throughout history. That's cool,
[16:31.420 --> 16:32.420]  don't worry about it.
[16:32.420 --> 16:35.780]  I just had the wild hair to wear sunglasses and kind of take the metaphor to the next
[16:35.780 --> 16:43.140]  level or the illustration to the next level. And then you come to the realization, these
[16:43.140 --> 16:50.020]  aren't mine, who knows if they fit, kind of like Agent Smith Matrix classes. You come
[16:50.020 --> 16:55.060]  to the realization that that's what people are into, and they want the surface.
[16:55.060 --> 17:02.780]  They want the illusion over the reality. They've been trained, especially by television, that
[17:02.780 --> 17:10.380]  that's all that matters. And that's something that the most guttered rock and roll stars
[17:10.380 --> 17:16.200]  or hip hop rap people get, have a bunch of women in bikinis jumping around in front of
[17:16.200 --> 17:21.940]  a mansion at a pool, wear a bunch of gold around your neck, wear a crown on your head
[17:21.940 --> 17:25.620]  and everyone will bow down to you. And that's actually true.
[17:25.620 --> 17:30.300]  The police will bow down to you. The bureaucrats will bow down to you. The whole culture will
[17:30.300 --> 17:40.820]  bow down to you because you're saying I'm somebody. And within that lie, they can sell
[17:40.820 --> 17:47.620]  you tyranny. And more than 80 years ago, Edward Bernays, head of the Department of War, Psychological
[17:47.620 --> 18:01.140]  Warfare Division, and top consultant to all of the Fortune top 100 companies at the time.
[18:01.140 --> 18:08.500]  He came out and said, we've got to take burgeoning Hollywood and we've got to merge it. He said
[18:08.500 --> 18:16.580]  this in the 30s. We've got to merge it with red carpet events with politicians to make
[18:16.580 --> 18:23.420]  them celebrities and to shift debate away from issues and facts to how someone's suit
[18:23.420 --> 18:26.420]  or tie looks.
[18:26.420 --> 18:31.740]  And they did that. And this had gone on before for thousands of years. I mean, the rough
[18:31.740 --> 18:38.740]  writers met down at the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, Teddy Roosevelt. And they said, we'll
[18:38.740 --> 18:44.460]  get photographers and illustrators out there. And we've got Hearst publishing behind us,
[18:44.460 --> 18:50.420]  in the big newspaper chain, owned by a big robber baron, coal robber baron, William Randolph
[18:50.420 --> 18:51.420]  Hearst.
[18:51.420 --> 18:55.060]  And we'll ride up San Juan Hill. There'll be no one there fighting us. And then we'll
[18:55.060 --> 19:01.300]  report atrocities, like babies in incubators and Gaddafi raping women with Viagra. It doesn't
[19:01.300 --> 19:08.220]  matter if it's not true. And we will announce that we have defeated the Spanish. And we'll
[19:08.220 --> 19:13.380]  have some other events, blowing up the main, a false flag in 1898. And then we'll take
[19:13.380 --> 19:18.940]  the entire Pacific Ocean from the Spanish.
[19:18.940 --> 19:23.980]  And so that's just how things are done. But you've got a general public not even aware
[19:23.980 --> 19:35.980]  that that's going on. And I guess we're all slaves to it. Because I guess I do wear a
[19:35.980 --> 19:41.060]  sports jacket. I'm building a more fancy studio. All because that will get the sheeple to pay
[19:41.060 --> 19:45.780]  more attention. And then maybe from that platform, I can get them out of their trance. Because
[19:45.780 --> 19:49.780]  let me explain to you what's really going on past all the hype and all the glitter and
[19:49.780 --> 19:55.660]  all the glamour. You are being murdered slowly. And I'm going to tell you about that when
[19:55.660 --> 20:01.260]  we come back.

[21:35.880 --> 21:40.420]  lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct
[21:40.420 --> 21:44.080]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties
[21:44.080 --> 21:47.660]  of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a free silver dollar

[24:18.140 --> 24:22.460]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the worldwide radio transmission channel cast
[24:22.460 --> 24:28.260]  with a free podcast and audio feeds and all the free iPhone and Droid apps at infowars.com
[24:28.260 --> 24:34.780]  forward slash show where you can also see me wearing Jim Jones sunglasses. These are
[24:34.780 --> 24:40.300]  not mine. One of the crew loaned them to me so that I could do the illustration of people
[24:40.300 --> 24:42.500]  have been trained to only look on the surface.
[24:42.500 --> 24:46.580]  Now, in the old days, in every major culture, it wasn't just the surface unless it was the
[24:46.580 --> 24:52.620]  beauty of a woman. Even if a man was big and strong, it wasn't really respected on the
[24:52.620 --> 25:01.340]  surface until the person was proven. Everything was about proven, proven quality, proven loyalty,
[25:01.340 --> 25:07.580]  proven. See, and still today the successful don't look on the surface, the successful
[25:07.580 --> 25:10.180]  look on what's proven.
[25:10.180 --> 25:16.220]  The losers look on what's glitzy and glamorous and the flavor of the day. And that's what's
[25:16.220 --> 25:22.220]  going to separate in this society the winners from the losers. And I want you to win. I
[25:22.220 --> 25:26.100]  want you to be successful. I believe in a win-win. The problem is the globalists are
[25:26.100 --> 25:29.060]  engineering a society where that's not the case.
[25:29.060 --> 25:37.100]  They would rather have a monopoly of control. And they would rather have you just be spectators
[25:37.100 --> 25:42.940]  who look on the surface. Because if you stop looking on the surface, you'll find out what's
[25:42.940 --> 25:50.620]  going on behind the mask. And then you might actually be a contender in the marketplace
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.260]  and the monopoly men don't want that.
[25:52.260 --> 25:57.100]  Now, I'm gonna cover this later after we cover economic news with Max Keiser and ask him
[25:57.100 --> 26:00.180]  why he thinks this is happening. But let me just get a little bit into this now, then
[26:00.180 --> 26:06.140]  I'll get into the military economic and huge NSA and Supreme Court rulings where the illegals
[26:06.140 --> 26:07.140]  can all vote.
[26:07.140 --> 26:11.100]  I mean, that's the plan. They're gonna get our guns. If I could turn the illegals into
[26:11.100 --> 26:16.940]  pro-gun, pro-liberty people. Quite frankly, I think we could handle 30 million people.
[26:16.940 --> 26:22.020]  We can't, folks. It's gonna be over. Socialism at the grassroots, fascism on top, all our
[26:22.020 --> 26:23.400]  guns are gonna be taken.
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.080]  And the state's gonna take most of our kids. There's gonna be a civil war in the country.
[26:28.080 --> 26:33.100]  And they're gonna racially brand it. And it's very, very sad. And the globalists will destroy
[26:33.100 --> 26:36.580]  this country one way or another. And what was the old saying? It's easier to burn down
[26:36.580 --> 26:39.620]  a barn than to build one.
[26:39.620 --> 26:46.300]  The globalists love to wreck things because it's so much easier. And they've created cosmology
[26:46.300 --> 26:53.100]  or kind of a universal world construct. And this is just the news from today and yesterday,
[26:53.100 --> 26:58.620]  a very small portion of it that I'd like to show TV viewers.
[26:58.620 --> 27:05.020]  Radio listeners can just search engine this. You can find it. California allows up to 1,000
[27:05.020 --> 27:10.260]  times more glyphosate in drinking water than needed. Then it links to major scientific
[27:10.260 --> 27:17.260]  studies that a fraction of what they allow in the water and what they say is safe is
[27:17.260 --> 27:27.900]  absolutely connected to sexual cancers, especially female cancers, ovarian and breast.
[27:27.900 --> 27:31.620]  And of course, we lead the world in breast cancer and we lead the world in glyphosate
[27:31.620 --> 27:38.220]  usage. The study published in Food and Chemical Toxicology is entitled Glyphosate induces
[27:38.220 --> 27:43.620]  human breast cancer cells growth via estrogen receptors. Hey, don't get rid of Roundup.
[27:43.620 --> 27:48.980]  Just cut your breast off, man. Come on, I mean, don't tell Angelina Jolie why there's
[27:48.980 --> 27:56.540]  a 3,000 plus percent breast cancer increase in the US, something like 2,500 in Canada.
[27:56.540 --> 28:01.140]  And I'm wrong. When I was in England, I learned they've gone above us. They now lead the world
[28:01.140 --> 28:09.220]  for major industrialized countries in breast cancer. And the US and England are kinda neck
[28:09.220 --> 28:12.340]  and neck on who's gonna take the crown.
[28:12.340 --> 28:16.860]  You go to countries where there's no GMO, where they're not taking a bunch of vaccines,
[28:16.860 --> 28:20.520]  where they don't have glyphosate. People are like cancer? That's what 80-year-old people
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.700]  get sometimes? You mean you have children dying of cancer? We've never heard of that.
[28:25.700 --> 28:30.180]  Never heard of it here either. But hey, again, I'm a conspiracy theorist. Next, I'm gonna
[28:30.180 --> 28:36.300]  tell you that the NSA is spying on you, like I told you 18 years ago, exactly how they
[28:36.300 --> 28:37.300]  were.
[28:37.300 --> 28:42.020]  Of course, it's in the news now, they're economically spying on you. But see, here's the rest of
[28:42.020 --> 28:47.140]  the story. I don't like the communists in Venezuela, but the communists there are kind
[28:47.140 --> 28:53.260]  of the run of the mill blue collar type. So you gotta halfway respect them. They're not
[28:53.260 --> 28:57.500]  like a Chinese communist type. It's actually run by the left, by a bunch of bankers like
[28:57.500 --> 28:59.620]  Rockefeller on record.
[28:59.620 --> 29:04.820]  Venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding, but their bare minimum gonna ban formula.
[29:04.820 --> 29:12.140]  Well, I mean, why not? Brains of children fed different formulas on some cases are 30%
[29:12.140 --> 29:17.740]  smaller. I mean, the CC size of the cranium in size the same, look this up. The brain
[29:17.740 --> 29:21.620]  never grows. You'd think what came out of mama's mammary glands is what you're supposed
[29:21.620 --> 29:22.620]  to have.
[29:22.620 --> 29:26.660]  But how about have something that's 70% sugar instead of 20% sugar like it's supposed to
[29:26.660 --> 29:32.540]  be and doesn't have the protein fat. But we all know low fats good for you. So I mean,
[29:32.540 --> 29:36.140]  no wonder the public's a bunch of zombies, fluoride poisons. I mean, I always say to
[29:36.140 --> 29:37.580]  people that call them they're really dumb.
[29:37.580 --> 29:41.060]  Did your mother not breastfeed you? They always get mad and go, no, she didn't. And I feel
[29:41.060 --> 29:46.440]  sorry for these people. These are lobotomized zombies. I mean, I can't believe they can
[29:46.440 --> 29:49.740]  even tie their shoelaces.
[29:49.740 --> 30:01.280]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[33:04.620 --> 33:16.980]  it's Alex Jones. Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, we're here live. Thank
[33:16.980 --> 33:22.340]  you so much for joining us on these websites, our infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. I saw
[33:22.340 --> 33:27.420]  an article where Ben and Jerry's, on the subject of breast milk being healthier for children,
[33:27.420 --> 33:34.380]  no kidding, they've been toying with the idea of having human breast milk flavored ice cream.
[33:34.380 --> 33:39.340]  And then you've got a trendy company I saw last week in the news here in Austin that
[33:39.340 --> 33:46.020]  has breast milk in their lollipops. So I guess they've got women who are pumping milk and
[33:46.020 --> 33:51.500]  doing that to make a bunch of money off a specialty market for yuppies. But then babies
[33:51.500 --> 33:57.140]  whose brains are designed, whether it's a cow, then that milk's designed for a calf.
[33:57.140 --> 34:03.300]  Or if it's a chimpanzee, its milk is designed for a chimpanzee. And it's almost become a
[34:03.300 --> 34:09.580]  conspiracy theory that you shouldn't breastfeed your children. And they, women, go to work
[34:09.580 --> 34:15.180]  the first few months and just give your child this formula. They've had all these formula
[34:15.180 --> 34:21.100]  scandals around the world where the formula is so bad children die in mass.
[34:21.100 --> 34:25.740]  And so then they reformulate it to where it only brain damages the children. And I'm not
[34:25.740 --> 34:31.900]  trying to be mean about this, making fun of people. It's a very sad culture, very sick.
[34:31.900 --> 34:35.180]  If you can't breastfeed your children at least the first six months, something's wrong with
[34:35.180 --> 34:39.460]  you. Me, I was breastfed till I was 18 months old. And my mother always tells a story of
[34:39.460 --> 34:44.660]  I walked up to her in Target. And I said, hey, mama, I wanna eat right now.
[34:44.660 --> 34:51.460]  I used another choice word. She said, that is it. You are weaned officially. But in third
[34:51.460 --> 34:55.980]  world countries where the kids would starve, sometimes it goes longer. And it's a natural
[34:55.980 --> 35:01.660]  thing. And they try to make it dirty. They try to make it bad. This is what mammals do.
[35:01.660 --> 35:08.000]  I know that's a conspiracy theory for some people out there. Money doesn't grow on trees
[35:08.000 --> 35:16.340]  and neither does mother's milk. And I had Mike Adams in here last year and he brought
[35:16.340 --> 35:19.420]  several different brands of the best selling.
[35:19.420 --> 35:28.640]  We should do a report on this, best selling formula powder. And most of them were 70 plus
[35:28.640 --> 35:36.900]  percent corn syrup and sugar. It'd be 45% corn syrup and then 15% high fructose corn
[35:36.900 --> 35:44.300]  syrup and 15% this sugar and that. I mean, unbelievable. And that's not what is in human
[35:44.300 --> 35:48.340]  milk. It's a lower percentage of natural sugar from your mother.
[35:48.340 --> 35:53.260]  It is protein and fat that your brain's made out of. It's like they say, don't eat butter.
[35:53.260 --> 35:58.100]  But then all the studies show it's the hydrogenated artificial oils that are cooked that are clogging
[35:58.100 --> 36:04.660]  up your heart because it's not natural. It's like McDonald's. I heard on the news 10 years
[36:04.660 --> 36:11.100]  ago, almost ran off the road, that well, McDonald's has been authorized to continue using silicon
[36:11.100 --> 36:13.820]  in their fried foods like McNuggets.
[36:13.820 --> 36:18.140]  And I went home and looked it up and it turns out that most of the fried foods at fast food
[36:18.140 --> 36:24.820]  places have a plastic agent in them. Do you know what that does to your kidneys? See,
[36:24.820 --> 36:31.100]  we're living in the twilight zone. So right here, California allows up to 1000 times more
[36:31.100 --> 36:37.540]  glyphosate in drinking water than needed.
[36:37.540 --> 36:44.820]  Venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding. Now again, here's something that gives you
[36:44.820 --> 36:51.580]  all sorts of cancer, testicular cancer, breast cancer, because it's a toxic estrogen mimicker
[36:51.580 --> 36:55.380]  and totally accelerates the aging. That's why girls are going into puberty when they're
[36:55.380 --> 36:59.300]  six, seven, eight years old now, used to be 13, 14.
[36:59.300 --> 37:04.620]  Boys are waiting to go into puberty till 15, 16, cuz they've been feminized. In fact, there's
[37:04.620 --> 37:13.060]  a large phenomenon now I read about where male testicles are not dropping, ever, because
[37:13.060 --> 37:15.860]  we're being hit with chemical warfare.
[37:15.860 --> 37:20.780]  Here's another one. Venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding. The Venezuelan Congress
[37:20.780 --> 37:26.860]  is set to discuss legislation next week that would prohibit bottle feeding of infants in
[37:26.860 --> 37:34.180]  an attempt to encourage breastfeeding and reduce the use of baby formula. And it says
[37:34.180 --> 37:38.500]  that the head of the Venezuelan ruling socialist party said the proposal would prohibit all
[37:38.500 --> 37:45.340]  types of baby bottles as a way to improve children's health.
[37:45.340 --> 37:50.300]  I hate to agree with socialists, but I tell you, and the nanny state has no right to do
[37:50.300 --> 37:55.900]  stuff like that. I mean, I guess it is really child abuse though, I guess they do in a way.
[37:55.900 --> 37:59.660]  But it just shows how that's its own rogue weird socialist state down there. That's why
[37:59.660 --> 38:03.460]  they wanna bring it down. If you're the communist state of China murdering political dissidents
[38:03.460 --> 38:09.500]  and giant Foxconn factories with the humans committing suicide mass, that's okay.
[38:09.500 --> 38:14.540]  But if you wanna, see a real socialist country would actually want a bunch of worker bees
[38:14.540 --> 38:20.260]  and wouldn't want the cost of brain damaged dumb people everywhere. But a eugenics program
[38:20.260 --> 38:25.420]  would. America was the enemy, folks, because of our liberties. So they put fluoride in
[38:25.420 --> 38:29.480]  our water that lowers IQ and average 20 points, increases cancer.
[38:29.480 --> 38:37.020]  Look it up, Harvard studies, magic word, Harvard. 60 years of formula, all of it. The public
[38:37.020 --> 38:44.300]  are as dumb as a box of rocks. Let's continue here. Researchers find biological evidence
[38:44.300 --> 38:51.460]  of Gulf War illness. And they found in the brain scans, the CAT scans, that indeed, there
[38:51.460 --> 38:56.840]  is cell death in the tissue of the vets.
[38:56.840 --> 39:01.620]  This is old news, folks, this just came out Friday. They know that the US government,
[39:01.620 --> 39:06.800]  the Pentagon ordered more than 200 sites, some small, some gigantic like Amicia. People
[39:06.800 --> 39:14.140]  thought nukes had gone off when they blew up these weapons caches of sarin, VX, mustard
[39:14.140 --> 39:19.680]  gas, you name it. And there were mushroom clouds of it right over the border from Kuwait.
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.060]  It rained down, 25,000 plus chemical weapons detectors went off. I watched congressional
[39:24.060 --> 39:32.420]  hearings in 93, two years after Desert Storm. And the troops, some of them that were closer,
[39:32.420 --> 39:34.180]  it got through their mask and killed them.
[39:34.180 --> 39:36.660]  But then when the detectors went off, they went, we got a problem. We're gonna admit
[39:36.660 --> 39:41.860]  we ordered chemical weapons blown up as if they didn't know what was gonna happen. And
[39:41.860 --> 39:45.860]  now we're gonna have to give everybody treatment for this. And the answer is just tell them
[39:45.860 --> 39:51.360]  take their mask off, it's a false alarm.
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.940]  And the troops went, well, most of these detectors aren't sophisticated, they're chemical tape.
[39:55.940 --> 40:01.160]  You put tape all over the tanks on your uniform, and if chemical nerve agents hit it, stripes
[40:01.160 --> 40:10.420]  pop up. And everybody was on the news going, it turned on, my eyes are watering too. No,
[40:10.420 --> 40:14.020]  you didn't get hit by anything, sweetie pie.
[40:14.020 --> 40:19.860]  And then they had all these Marines and Army officers in wheelchairs testifying that, just
[40:19.860 --> 40:24.620]  six months ago, I could still walk. It made me cry watching it, now I can hardly talk.
[40:24.620 --> 40:28.460]  And the guy was famously died a few weeks after the testimony, I think it was a Marine
[40:28.460 --> 40:32.700]  colonel. And thousands of them died right then, hundreds of thousands have been sick,
[40:32.700 --> 40:35.660]  50 something thousand have died total.
[40:35.660 --> 40:41.160]  Thousands within just a few months of it happening. And massive increases in birth defects, just
[40:41.160 --> 40:48.180]  like using DU, 14 fold increase in Fallujah, seven fold increase across the board in Iraq.
[40:48.180 --> 40:56.240]  Our troops, same thing, three to six fold increase in deformity from the DU, why? Because
[40:56.240 --> 40:59.600]  the globalists did it on purpose, folks.
[40:59.600 --> 41:08.280]  They invented DU as a weapon back in 1945. In 46, they had white papers written up on
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.340]  them. I've had Doug Rocky, the former head of the program, all of them on. And they knew
[41:13.340 --> 41:23.020]  exactly what it was doing. They knew exactly what was happening. And our military was corrupt
[41:23.020 --> 41:26.840]  and was influenced heavily by 30,000 plus Nazis they brought over here.
[41:26.840 --> 41:32.580]  But they still would radiate some troops and nerve gas some troops and test and get foster
[41:32.580 --> 41:37.020]  kids and radiate them to death, but that was core groups of scientists. But there was enough
[41:37.020 --> 41:43.060]  general knowledge, that was kind of the mad scientist corp, the eugenics corp. Regular
[41:43.060 --> 41:45.380]  scientists led into the cult.
[41:45.380 --> 41:51.020]  And any scientist will tell you that's a good scientist, they've been offered into the cult.
[41:51.020 --> 41:57.580]  My dad was offered into the cult as a high schooler. He was in the Science Academy for
[41:57.580 --> 42:01.300]  the state, and a junior and a senior, and I've told the story before. And they brought
[42:01.300 --> 42:08.220]  him in and the other five top scorers out of hundreds and said that they brought to
[42:08.220 --> 42:12.080]  the university for testing all summer long and said, all right, you ready to hear the
[42:12.080 --> 42:13.860]  grand plan?
[42:13.860 --> 42:18.060]  The point is, is that that's how you get the mad scientist to do all this. Once you have
[42:18.060 --> 42:23.200]  that core, you can expand your shadow government using the mad scientist. And if you look at
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.720]  all the different departments of energy, all these departments, they're all run by mad
[42:26.720 --> 42:30.540]  scientists like John P. Holdren, who writes books about how he wants to get rid of 80%
[42:30.540 --> 42:35.260]  of the world's population, how they're spiking their water supply, wrote the book Ecoscience.
[42:35.260 --> 42:42.820]  Now, this is just today's news. California allows up to 1,000 times more glyphosate in
[42:42.820 --> 42:51.540]  drinking water than needed. And again, by needed, that's what they mean by what's safe,
[42:51.540 --> 42:54.060]  to cause breast cancer in women.
[42:54.060 --> 42:58.180]  That's Mike Adams' headline. Last week a story broke that revealed glyphosate, the chemical
[42:58.180 --> 43:07.500]  name of Roundup herbicide, multiplies the proliferation of breast cancer cells by 500
[43:07.500 --> 43:15.580]  to 1,300%, even as exposures of just a few parts per trillion. The study published in
[43:15.580 --> 43:21.280]  Food and Chemical Toxicology is entitled, Glyphosate Induces Human Breast Cancer Cell
[43:21.280 --> 43:26.220]  Growth via Estrogen Receptors.
[43:26.220 --> 43:30.100]  There's a whole lot more to the story, however, but to follow it, you need to understand these
[43:30.100 --> 43:37.820]  terms. PPM equals parts per million. Minus six equals numbers of parts out of a million.
[43:37.820 --> 43:45.180]  PPB equals parts per billion, equals 10 minus nine, which is 1,000 times smaller than PPM.
[43:45.180 --> 43:53.260]  PPT parts per trillion equals 10 minus 12, which is 1,000 times smaller than the 1 million
[43:53.260 --> 43:57.060]  times smaller than PPM.
[43:57.060 --> 44:04.380]  And then it just goes into the fact that parts per trillion in the major studies show huge
[44:04.380 --> 44:13.980]  increases in breast cancer, just in a breast cancer study. And now they are allowing 1,000
[44:13.980 --> 44:21.940]  times what they were previously authorizing in the water. And then there's a lot more
[44:21.940 --> 44:28.100]  to the story. The point is, it's up on infoawards.com and naturalnews.com. But here it is right
[44:28.100 --> 44:35.680]  here, researchers find biological evidence of Gulf War illness.
[44:35.680 --> 44:40.260]  And it goes over the fact that, okay, they are brain damaged, okay, this is going on.
[44:40.260 --> 44:44.540]  Well, they did autopsies a few years after the war on people dying. You can look this
[44:44.540 --> 44:51.760]  up. It was even in Life magazine, and found that they had nerve gas, sarin, VX, and other
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.340]  agents in their brain stems. And that's finally what killed them was losing motor control.
[44:56.340 --> 44:58.740]  And finally, they can't breathe anymore and suffocate.
[44:58.740 --> 45:04.180]  So you go from being a Marine Corps Colonel, Mr. Tough Guy, to your wife changing your
[45:04.180 --> 45:10.420]  diapers to fighting for your life, then on a respirator, then dead. And they knew, folks,
[45:10.420 --> 45:13.940]  just like they knew the dust at the World Trade Center was deadly day one, and said,
[45:13.940 --> 45:17.060]  take off your respirators, you don't even need them.
[45:17.060 --> 45:20.880]  Because if they would have said issue respirators, they would have had to admit that the dust
[45:20.880 --> 45:29.700]  was deadly. And you ask, why do they do this? It's not just that life's cheap, they enjoy
[45:29.700 --> 45:36.580]  killing you. Bayer Pharmaceutical, as you know, about eight years ago was found guilty
[45:36.580 --> 45:37.780]  in France.
[45:37.780 --> 45:42.740]  They also were criminally in trouble in Australia, nothing even happened here. And the documents
[45:42.740 --> 45:50.140]  came out in the court case. It was on NBC News, you name it. Just type in Bayer blood
[45:50.140 --> 45:56.060]  scandal. And they knew that every ampule of factor eight for hemophiliacs and other disorders
[45:56.060 --> 46:02.860]  was filled with a mega dose of HIV, hepatitis, multiple types of hepatitis.
[46:02.860 --> 46:09.820]  It was a death sentence injected into people's compromised immune systems, a death sentence.
[46:09.820 --> 46:15.660]  And they had the corporate minutes where for a decade, they were in there suppressing their
[46:15.660 --> 46:23.820]  own sub-executives who didn't wanna be part of it.
[46:23.820 --> 46:32.580]  Because it was seen as a public service to kill hemophiliacs. So I want you all to listen
[46:32.580 --> 46:40.080]  to me and listen real good. I don't like having to do this job. I never thought of myself
[46:40.080 --> 46:42.380]  as being one of the most prominent people in this fight.
[46:42.380 --> 46:49.540]  I don't have all the answers. I don't want to be your leader. I don't claim to do an
[46:49.540 --> 46:56.500]  even near perfect job. But we're the best there is here at mfallwars.com. And I've done
[46:56.500 --> 47:01.220]  the research. And quite frankly, things are much worse than I can even explain here because
[47:01.220 --> 47:02.220]  there's so much.
[47:02.220 --> 47:06.380]  I mean, look at just the news from today here on my desk if you're watching us on TV. There's
[47:06.380 --> 47:14.060]  probably 200 news articles here, each one more important than the last. All I can say
[47:14.060 --> 47:29.140]  to you out there, all I can say to you is that I know there are a lot of smart professional
[47:29.140 --> 47:35.100]  people out there who've been taught their entire life that getting ahead means not taking
[47:35.100 --> 47:39.620]  risk, going with the flow, and working in the system.
[47:39.620 --> 47:42.940]  And I know a lot of you know this, but you say, well, how are you gonna change it? What
[47:42.940 --> 47:48.740]  are we gonna do about it? The public's dumbed down, nobody cares. If you have that attitude,
[47:48.740 --> 47:56.380]  it is a death sentence to you and your family. Look at the numbers. If you look at neurological
[47:56.380 --> 48:07.300]  disorders, If you look at all the different diseases increasing everything, no one is
[48:07.300 --> 48:08.300]  going to escape this.
[48:08.300 --> 48:14.380]  And your progeny, your children, their children, the whole future of humanity is being cursed
[48:14.380 --> 48:21.280]  by the pollution of evil, the corruption that's going on right now. Everything is organized
[48:21.280 --> 48:27.220]  around being anti-human. And so as long as it hurts humans, it's authorized and encouraged.
[48:27.220 --> 48:32.840]  And the worst of the worst have competed to get in positions of power. And they really
[48:32.840 --> 48:39.880]  enjoy trying to forcibly inoculate you and your family, not to protect you from pathogens,
[48:39.880 --> 48:42.860]  but to brain damage you and hurt you on record.
[48:42.860 --> 48:50.180]  Just like the fluoride, just like the glyphosate, just like the additives that are put in so
[48:50.180 --> 48:59.280]  many things. This is all done publicly to so poison and so intoxicate humanity that
[48:59.280 --> 49:05.720]  we're basically walking dead. And we're not walking dead yet, but we're getting close
[49:05.720 --> 49:15.460]  to it. Even the best of our species show the wear and tear from this poisoning process.
[49:15.460 --> 49:21.560]  And this is the big enchilada. They knew when they blew up giant chemical weapons bases.
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.880]  He had like the fourth biggest stockpile it was estimated. I was doing some research again
[49:25.880 --> 49:30.640]  last night. Saddam had one of the biggest caches of chemical weapons in the world. It
[49:30.640 --> 49:33.360]  had been mainly sold to him by the US.
[49:33.360 --> 49:38.060]  The US had given him satellite trajectory and weather maps on how to fire it and artillery
[49:38.060 --> 49:45.360]  and spread out of helicopters on the Iranians. They always go, he used gas on his own people.
[49:45.360 --> 49:53.340]  Yeah, and our criminal government commanded him and ran that operation. And then they
[49:53.340 --> 50:02.400]  blow it all up, just huge caches of it. It rains down over the region. Our troops would
[50:02.400 --> 50:09.240]  only pull back, in some cases, five, six miles and would have convulsions on the spot, would
[50:09.240 --> 50:14.340]  be coughing, eyes watering.
[50:14.340 --> 50:19.880]  And all of this is going on. Yeah, there's AP. Rumsfeld helped Iraq get chemical weapons.
[50:19.880 --> 50:26.460]  Yeah, he helped Iran get weapons. He helped North Korea get nuclear reactors. And they
[50:26.460 --> 50:34.280]  knew when they blew all these, over 200 facilities, big ones, many of them huge, that it would
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.280]  rain down.
[50:35.280 --> 50:38.960]  And then they said, your detectors are going off, false alarm. Remember you heard on the
[50:38.960 --> 50:45.360]  news? Chemical weapons alarms, false alarm, false alarm. And then they didn't give them
[50:45.360 --> 50:49.220]  treatment when they go in. They won't give them surgeries. They won't give them help.
[50:49.220 --> 50:56.080]  They give them Prozac. I mean, that's what they think about all of you folks. Okay, we
[50:56.080 --> 51:00.640]  have really bad people that have been known to do secret experiments in control.
[51:00.640 --> 51:06.100]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[51:06.100 --> 51:11.360]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[51:11.360 --> 51:15.640]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[51:15.640 --> 51:20.840]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[51:20.840 --> 51:25.560]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control Mother Nature,

[53:58.520 --> 54:22.960]  And I want to be clear, ladies and gentlemen, so many new listeners say, man, this guy is
[54:22.960 --> 54:29.640]  so negative. I don't want to hear this. No, I'm telling you that major studies have shown
[54:29.640 --> 54:36.220]  that Roundup, I mean, they've got movies about it with George Clooney for heaven's sakes,
[54:36.220 --> 54:41.560]  is massively increasing cancer. And I'm here telling you we need to do something about
[54:41.560 --> 54:42.560]  it.
[54:42.560 --> 54:46.200]  I'm here telling you they put fluoride in the water to give you cancer and dumb you
[54:46.200 --> 54:51.560]  down and they're on record doing it. Let's get moving and warn people. I guess this show
[54:51.560 --> 54:55.560]  is negative if you don't think anything of yourself and you just think you have no power.
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.680]  Me, I take all this real personal and I'm angry and I'm focused. And here's something
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.660]  else. I don't apologize for going to the BBC and getting in their presenter's face who
[55:04.660 --> 55:05.660]  was laughing at me.
[55:05.660 --> 55:11.400]  I don't apologize for getting in the face of Piers Morgan. I don't apologize to get
[55:11.400 --> 55:17.120]  in the face of FBI agents on video when they've gotten in my face. I've done nothing wrong.
[55:17.120 --> 55:22.000]  I'm here trying to wake people up and I'm sick of the globalist trying to keep everybody
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.880]  calm. They're like, the way to be credible is to stay calm, bull. They've taught you
[55:26.880 --> 55:31.320]  it's all about staying calm and wearing a psychopath suit and sitting there lying to
[55:31.320 --> 55:37.320]  people with a bunch of crooks in Congress and crooks on national TV, all acting calm
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.240]  and everything's normal and everybody don't upset anybody.
[55:42.240 --> 55:48.640]  It's because they don't want you to awaken. Coming up, confidence in newspapers at near
[55:48.640 --> 55:56.500]  record lows, polls find. Really, UPI? Poll, Obama approval rating plunges more, the most
[55:56.500 --> 56:05.080]  on people under 30, 17 points. You lost the trendy factor, Bubba. Guess who's way up in
[56:05.080 --> 56:08.360]  under 30, Infowars.com.
[56:08.360 --> 56:14.480]  Poll, Obama approval rating drops amid slew of controversies. What's the problem with
[56:14.480 --> 56:19.820]  that, though? He's just a puppet. The system needs to lose credibility. The Federal Reserve,
[56:19.820 --> 56:27.240]  the private offshore banking cartel. But it's called federal. Maybe Jeffrey Dahmer should
[56:27.240 --> 56:30.880]  have called himself Federal Reserve. The cops would have just walked off and said, continue
[56:30.880 --> 56:35.440]  murdering people. Poll, confidence in Congress at all time low.
[56:35.440 --> 56:41.320]  Again, the good news is people know they're being lied to, they know they're being screwed
[56:41.320 --> 56:46.440]  over, but that isn't enough, folks. The system knows you're waking up so they're buying armored
[56:46.440 --> 56:50.880]  vehicles, building bases, billions of bullets, training for war against us. We've got to
[56:50.880 --> 56:55.720]  get aggressive and in their face now, and we've got to vote with our dollars and support
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.200]  alternative and real media, and we all need to run for office.
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.980]  And we all just need to swarm the system with so many different actions. There's no way
[57:04.980 --> 57:12.120]  they can respond to it. Even if they've got AI predictive systems that can pretty much
[57:12.120 --> 57:18.640]  gauge the future to a great extent. It won't matter, they'll just see their own doom. Now
[57:18.640 --> 57:23.040]  false flags a household word. They've got mainstream news articles I saw this weekend
[57:23.040 --> 57:28.360]  in Britain and the US saying, did the US and NATO stage the chemical attack?
[57:28.360 --> 57:37.760]  These people predicted it. These people are us. You see, I just want humanity to survive.
[57:37.760 --> 57:41.940]  I don't understand what's so alien about that. People think they get ahead screwing other
[57:41.940 --> 57:46.760]  people. And that's not how you get ahead long term, ladies and gentlemen. I'm gonna stop
[57:46.760 --> 57:47.760]  preaching.
[57:47.760 --> 57:51.400]  I'll get to all this news with Max Keiser coming up. We'll take phone calls, I promise,
[57:51.400 --> 57:56.000]  wide open phones in the third hour. Briefly, ladies and gentlemen, I wanna tell you about
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.280]  some of the sponsors that make our broadcast possible. One of them is Infidel Body Armor.
[58:00.280 --> 58:03.360]  You can go to their website and see their amazing catalog of everything from backpacks
[58:03.360 --> 58:06.080]  to body armor, backpack body armor.
[58:06.080 --> 58:12.580]  It's all available, ladies and gentlemen, on their website at infidelbodyarmor.com.
[58:12.580 --> 58:18.280]  One word, infidelbodyarmor.com. And regular body armor only stops about six rounds. This
[58:18.280 --> 58:27.480]  stops hundreds. Go check it out. Infidelbodyarmor.com or 888-608-6605, 888-608-6605.

[58:43.240 --> 58:48.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:48.640 --> 58:55.960]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[58:55.960 --> 59:01.200]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[59:01.200 --> 59:05.520]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[59:05.520 --> 59:10.720]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[59:10.720 --> 59:15.400]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[59:15.400 --> 59:20.480]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[59:20.480 --> 59:24.840]  with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store

[59:56.760 --> 01:00:11.640]  on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:19.280]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:28.520]  Texas, Alex Jones. Well, Edward Snowden tells the press in an online press conference that
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.520]  the truth is coming out and the government can't stop by murdering me. But he goes on
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:38.560]  to say they want to murder him. The Chinese government's come out and said he's not working
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.840]  for them and said it's ridiculous that Dick Cheney said that. If anybody's working for
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.200]  the Communist Chinese, it's Dick Cheney. And the Bushes and all them opening up China and
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.000]  selling us out to them. Bill Clinton, all of them, it's ridiculous. Give up your rights
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.080]  to the military-industrial complex. The Chinese communists will get us. The globalists put
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:04.400]  them in power. Kicked out Chiang Kai-Shek. Unbelievable. That's just some of what is
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.040]  coming up on that front. We're gonna be joined as well by Max Keiser. He's got a new article
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:16.360]  out that's just went up on Infowars.com. The collapse of the current bankster regime is
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:23.700]  upon us, is his headline and he wrote this article for Infowars.com. So we've got that
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.460]  article up there right now.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:31.140]  He will be joining us. He said you'd see a dollar plunge and a worldwide stock market
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.400]  plunge starting at the end of April, early May. And he'll tell you that he's a month
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:39.320]  and a half off. That's what he was saying a week and a half ago. I still wasn't convinced
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:44.840]  completely, but more and more, I hope he's wrong. Even though it's a fiat system, we're
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.640]  riding on top of it.
[01:01:47.640 --> 01:02:01.480]  And it's just the Federal Reserve hinting at ending QE4 or QE unlimited or QE infinity,
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:07.240]  which is just free money to them that they loan out to us at 10, 20, 30%. Just hinting
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.960]  at that to show how kept we are, how controlled we are by these foreign offshore banks has
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.640]  set the stock market the last few weeks, as you know, going downwards.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:22.840]  So we're gonna be looking at that with Max Keiser here in the next segment. First, I'll
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:32.680]  get into the latest NSA news as well. And again, I got into the fact, just to illustrate
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.500]  who the globalists are, they knew blowing up nerve gas caches would maim and kill many
[01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:39.640]  of our troops and debilitate them.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.760]  That's now admitted in the New York Times. This shows you who these people are. California
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:49.920]  allows up to 1,000 times glyphosate that they know, 1,000 times lesser, massively increases
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:55.440]  breast cancer. Venezuela considers banning baby bottle feeding because it makes the brain
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.760]  smaller, the IQs lower, and the children unhealthy.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.080]  Yeah, it's all done by the eugenicist to have the working class basically brain damage the
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:09.840]  children. And they've known this for 50, 60 years. Of course, they've known it. How many
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.920]  controversies have they had where babies, guys, will you print me an article on this
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.720]  cuz it sounds insane.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:22.040]  Just type in baby formula, baby deaths. You'll see stuff in China and India and Africa where
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:28.320]  the globalists really sell the bad stuff where the babies just die. Here, they know that'd
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:35.040]  be a little too obvious. So they just get ready to have, one of the people getting diabetes
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:36.040]  when they're five.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:41.080]  They're getting 75% high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the average baby formula. I mean,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:45.960]  of course, your pancreas is dead on arrival. But what's wrong with having your arms and
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.520]  legs shot off? I mean, I got a buddy right now who's got diabetes, might have to get
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.520]  his toe chopped off. What's wrong with that? That's loving and liberal. It's trendy. I
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.480]  mean, what's wrong with Bayer putting HIV in the shots for hemophiliacs? It's loving.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.720]  It's trendy. Of course, I'm being sickeningly sarcastic. This stuff gets to me. And that's
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.960]  what I'm talking about. That's what I'm exposing. That's what I'm angry about. So I'm recapping
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.560]  that for people that joined us.
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.720]  But I've got about 15 stacks of news here I've not yet gotten to. And we're gonna go
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:21.660]  over it all with Max Keiser on the other side of this quick break. But first, is this his
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:27.120]  prediction a month and a half late coming true? Another article by Paul Joseph Watson
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.340]  that just went up, did Israel attack Syria again?
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:34.400]  Strike on advanced weapons shipment threatens huge escalation of conflict. The Saudi Arabians
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:44.040]  are announcing they're gonna ship missiles to Al-Qaeda. Unbelievable. And when Al-Qaeda
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.640]  blows up US airliners with these missiles, will they invade a country not involved again,
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.560]  like Iraq? Probably. Probably because there's a war against reality going on. Stay with
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.600]  us. I'm your host, Alex Jones, prisonplanet.tv.

[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:05.240]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:09.920]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:14.160]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.560]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.880]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:30.400]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:27.040]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.320]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the second hour of this worldwide broadcast. It is Monday,
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:39.880]  the 17th day of June, 2013. We're going to be joined by market analyst and journalist
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:46.320]  Max Keiser here in a moment to talk about the world economic condition. He is at the
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:51.800]  beginning of a crash that Max has been predicting for about a year that he thought would start
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:59.220]  in late April or early May. Was he late predicting it? His article on Infowars.com, the collapse
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:04.320]  of the current bankster regime is upon us. Well, they've been collapsing it by design,
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.040]  but too big to fail. So I mean, we're gonna talk to Max here in a moment. First off, Snowden
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.600]  gave a two-hour online press conference to the media. Business Insider linked up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.840]  We'll get it posted on Infowars.com as well. The truth is coming and the government can't
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:30.440]  stop it by murdering me. And he went on to say a lot more is coming out and that he thinks
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:34.000]  they're gonna try to kill him. Well, yeah, it came out in the news. The Daily Mail was
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.560]  at Dulles Airport and heard a bunch of government CIA spooks talking about how they wanna kill
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.200]  him and how they're gonna kill him.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.920]  Yeah, it's a mafia, folks, of foreign banks that run the intelligence agencies. And the
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.760]  big secret about the NSA is not a secret at all. Thousands of major companies have partial
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:56.280]  access. The Fortune 100 have total access and they make the money off of spying on everything
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.000]  and swapping the data.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.880]  And then they use it to corner the market. And what did Bloomberg report on Friday? What
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.140]  Max Keiser and I have told you for a long time, the stock market is totally rigged.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:12.000]  These companies are rigged, but only the big top insiders are allowed to have offshore
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:21.860]  bank accounts and deals offshore with corporations and trust and tax shelters where they pay
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:29.920]  no taxes. General Electric, Google, Berkshire Hathaway. Only the insiders are allowed to
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.520]  use the inside info.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.680]  So it's a globally gamed system. And it's not enough for the bankers to have unlimited
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.120]  fiat currency for themselves and to be able to create endless derivatives. They've been
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.740]  able to expand the derivatives market the last few years. It's not enough to have us
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:51.600]  then tied to their debt. Then they have all the inside data on everything. If a company's
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.800]  coming out with something that's gonna block them, not part of the insiders.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.800]  They try to buy it for pennies on the dollar. If they won't sell, boom, the IRS and regulators
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.680]  are turned loose on them. If that doesn't work, they just kill you. Industrial espionage,
[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:13.360]  they call it a disruptive technology. Warehouses of incredible energy devices, warehouses of
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:22.320]  incredible medical treatments that are then only given to the establishment.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.920]  And that's what a major Russian tycoon is in the news talking about today. But they
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.020]  know you're going to wanna have access to all this. That's why they're putting the police
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:39.360]  state grid in place. Look at this, GCHQ intercepted foreign politicians communications at G20
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360]  summits.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:45.460]  Really? And again, the idea is that America and England were spying for our countries.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:51.360]  We're run by big mega banks who own subsidiaries in all these countries. They use it to make
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.400]  sure they get their outcome. Do you understand that? They're deindustrializing us. Here's
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:02.160]  another one. The next NSA spying shoe to drop, pre-crime artificial intelligence, that's
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.160]  up on folwars.com.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.360]  Yet where they say you're guilty when you're not really guilty. They can also then not
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:14.100]  just predict the future with these systems, they can then program the future. Documents
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:21.320]  uncovered by Snowden show British eavesdropping by GCHQ. Again, repeatedly hacking in diplomats'
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:28.320]  phones emails report. G20 summit, NSA targeted Russian President Medvedev in London.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:35.580]  Folks, when I was inside a Bilderberg meeting after they'd already closed it down in 2008,
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:41.280]  every major room, conference room was jammed full of spy equipment with people openly going,
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.000]  I got a Navy satellite, I got an Air Force satellite. It's a GM7Q overlay, I told you.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.960]  And there was like people talking in French and German and Israeli. And each room was
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:57.200]  allowed to spy on the other. I mean, it's an incredibly important summit.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:03.400]  Continuing, Dick Cheney's suggestion, Snowden, a Chinese spy, is sheer nonsense, say the
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.320]  Chinese. I mean, if anybody's a Chinese spy, it's Cheney and the globalist. Edward Snowden,
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:14.460]  again, is not a Chinese spy, says Beijing. Cheney calls Snowden a traitor, says Rand
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.080]  Paul wrong about surveillance.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:27.580]  So it's all for our safety, right Cheney? And it goes on and on and on and on. And then
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:34.040]  you've got CIA whistleblower in prison for reporting on waterboarding. This is the type
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.520]  of garbage that's happening. I'm gonna go to our guest and get into the economic news
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.160]  and the latest on all the NSA spying.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:49.960]  But China is teetering on the brink, have a stack of news. Finch says China credit bubble
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:55.580]  unprecedented in modern world history. All of these credit bubbles are the same corporate
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:03.000]  interest accelerating money printing bubbles and fiat bubbles to take over the world and
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  then sign us on to their debt.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.200]  And then pose as the saviors during the global reorganization. And so I agree with Kaiser
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.040]  that we're already in a world meltdown with him lying and saying the economy's gotten
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.720]  great with the globalist picking winners and losers.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.840]  But I believe from their own statements, it is an engineered collapse. Now the question
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:27.840]  is, will they ride this out? But he said a year ago, it happened in April. And it didn't
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.380]  happen in April, he said late April. But it was a bold prediction. Now much of what he
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.320]  predicted is starting to happen.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.400]  I wouldn't say he's been proven correct yet. But I was watching CNBC this morning and they
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.000]  were all the pundits. Now they may zig when they zag, so it may be the opposite. But they
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.520]  were saying, yeah, it looks like the Fed's gonna start tapering. Yeah, things are gonna
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.440]  implode, outlook's bad.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.400]  What does that mean? It means they'll start a war as a political distraction, which you
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:15:03.840]  now see happening. So I see a lot of indicators there that the big collapse could be beginning
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:09.040]  to arrive. Now I hope that's not the case. But joining us is Max Kaiser, who of course
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.960]  invented the Hollywood Stock Exchange, which is the basis of a lot of the virtual trading
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960]  used today.
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.880]  And was a very successful stockbroker before, I guess retiring at like age 40. And he joins
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.480]  us now, he writes for a lot of major publications, maxkeiser.com, and has a show on RT as well,
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.400]  and has had shows on BBC. Max, you heard me kind of set the table there. Thank you for
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:35.480]  joining us from London. What do you make of my take on this and what is happening right
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.480]  now?
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:46.560]  Yeah, actually, it all turns on interest rates. And interest rates are starting to move up.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.680]  Now, this is pretty much going to put the kibosh on global bond markets and stock markets.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:59.920]  And the rhetoric coming out of the mainstream financial press, as of a couple of months
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.400]  ago, was that rising interest rates were telegraphing increased growth, that there was an increased
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.480]  growth in the economy. But since then, all the major economies that reported their GDPs
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:16.120]  are down, employment is flat, it's stagnating. So the reason interest rates are going up
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:23.320]  is not because of growth, but because of fear, fear that this unwinding of this epic bubble
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:29.880]  is happening. And so this is what I said would happen. And the rising interest rates are
[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:34.240]  telling us that that is exactly what is happening. So look for interest rates to continue to
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:39.240]  go higher. This means that anyone with mortgages, variable rate mortgages, particularly in the
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:47.800]  UK, what they call the mortgages that are variable rate mortgages, tracker mortgages,
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.400]  will be underwater very quickly at any houses that they bought. And of course, George Osborne,
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:58.200]  the chancellor of the exchequer, has been fueling a massive Ponzi scheme here in the
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:04.000]  UK by having the government guarantee mortgages up to 20 percent of a mortgage under a scheme
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.200]  called Help to Buy. He's actually mirroring the catastrophe that was Fannie Mae and Freddie
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:14.760]  Mac that led to the collapse of housing in America. So George Osborne is doing that now.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:22.080]  He's just started that program here. So this, of course, will also end in disaster.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:28.960]  Now for laymen out there, describe the economic situation we're in, why this is happening,
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:35.200]  and any other tricks they may have up their sleeve to extend the incremental collapse
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:40.720]  out that they want to properly milk us and then draw and quarter us, rather than a big
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:46.960]  accelerated collapse, which they fear in their own words, Mike. I mean, I saw Jim Cramer
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.360]  this morning saying stop the derivatives.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.180]  You're coming out with synthetic derivatives. The people aren't going to put up with it.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:58.220]  Stop it. You know, you guys are going to get us all in trouble. But it doesn't matter because
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:03.320]  the more aggressive criminals and Cramer admits that he's an insider trading criminal in videos,
[01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:08.000]  the more aggressive criminals, the suicide traders, as you call them, they're in control.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.400]  Yeah, well, if you have the context of this over the past 30 to 40 years, it's been a
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:22.200]  race between those who are creating debt and the growth that we see in the economy. And
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:29.560]  sometimes there is a positive GDP growth despite the increase in debt. Sometimes debt is growing
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:35.080]  faster than GDP, and we call those periods recessions. And when growth is outstripping
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.040]  debt, we call those periods of growth. But starting in 2008, the world now is in five
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.280]  years of debt increasing without any growth, really appreciable growth anywhere in the
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.840]  world. And it was even just six months ago China was considered to be growing. Now it's
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:56.160]  considered to be contracting or its growth rate de-accelerating. So there's no growth
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:01.720]  to get people out of this debt. The derivatives pile, the synthetic derivatives pile, the
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.560]  massive pile that Cramer's talking about is growing.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.320]  Now, is there another trick up the sleeve of the global banksters? There is another
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.400]  trick that they could do, which is that they could take up to $100 trillion of the bad
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:23.080]  debt, combine them in Europe, the U.S., and Asia into a new bond that they could create
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:32.320]  based on the IMF monetizing this paper, their special drawing right or SDR. The IMF is like
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:37.320]  a central bank in that respect, like the ECB or the Federal Reserve. It has its own currency,
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:43.640]  the special drawing right or the SDR. And two or three years ago Davos, one of the people
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:50.680]  attending to Davos mentioned that they could float a $100 trillion loan facility to roll
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.200]  up all this bad sovereign debt into a super global central estate.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.360]  And then back it with carbon taxes. Stay there. We'll be right back with a $100 trillion global
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.360]  government tax.
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.160]  You need it the most. Will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready? Gas and
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.400]  diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored. And more than half of generator failures during
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:14.740]  disasters occur as a result of expired fuel. PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:19.560]  for when you need it most. Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers, and ships at
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:28.240]  sea rely on PRI fuel stabilizers. And you can too. Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com

[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.440]  then carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes to service
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.440]  debt.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.200]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.440]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.120]  in the United States. Every establishment publication from National Review to MSNBC,
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.800]  from Bill O'Reilly to CNN.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:43.040]  And I just have a sick feeling that I've never had before about America and just about the
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.440]  world. I'm very, very, very, very, very upset because I don't get up here and talk about
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:54.840]  world economic collapses to have a shocking headline. I know when they get up there on
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:58.520]  all the financial shows and say it's the best economy ever, everything's wonderful.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.380]  I know what's happening in the real economy. I know about municipalities going bankrupt
[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:06.360]  all over the US and all over the world. I know about Europe being signed on to derivative
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:13.720]  debts that aren't their debts in any case. Trillions and trillions of dollars designed
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:21.720]  to bankrupt us. I see governments gearing up for oppression. I see just brazen criminal
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:26.560]  activity by the government and corporations and it freaks me out.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:31.200]  And so I look for places to move, places to run. There is nowhere. It's a global corporate
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:38.760]  government. And I've seen them go from it on MSNBC and CNN from saying the economy is
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:45.800]  wonderful to my gosh, we're in trouble. Which means that they may be getting ready to drop
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:50.040]  the hammer because they want to at least act like with short attention spans of the public
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:51.600]  that they knew what they were talking about.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.740]  They know the truth. And they could have fixed this is what's sad about it, but they cannot
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:05.120]  turn back from this gulag casino model that Max Keiser talks about. This is a short segment,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.080]  long segment coming up, Max. But are you dreading this as much as I am? I mean, how are you
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.560]  handling this emotionally and at your gut level?
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.360]  I mean, how bad is it? What do you really think is gonna happen, Max?
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:26.920]  Well, yeah, first of all, we miss you here in the UK. When you were here, the media and
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:32.320]  the TV shows were interesting for a few days. Now it's back to the same old boring BBC and
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.920]  same old nonsense. When are you coming back?
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:42.880]  Well, Max, I don't know. I don't know if I can run the gauntlet there and back here in
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:49.240]  the US. The point I'm getting at here is how bad is it currently right now?
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:57.360]  Well, it's a slow motion train wreck that is brought about by too much debt. I mean,
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.800]  I guess you could imagine that you've got this train and it's pulling debt. The American
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:08.600]  economy is the engine and it's pulling debt. And the government is adding more cars of
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:13.880]  debt to this train and it's slowing down and slowing down and it's coming to a complete
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:19.220]  stop and then people are panicking all over the world. And look what's happening in Chicago.
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:25.680]  Look at all the violence. Look what's happening in Detroit. The state is about to go bankrupt.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.920]  That's a direct result of this problem. It's just happening in a regional basis, but that's
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.640]  a direct result of what exactly we're talking about. So you say, when's it going to happen?
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:39.600]  When's the collapse going to happen? Well, in Detroit, it's happened already. In Chicago,
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:45.240]  it's more violent than Iraq. I mean, this is already happening. So it's happening right
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:51.040]  now. It's just, it hasn't happened from coast to coast as such, but it's happening in these
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.480]  pockets that are exploding in the United States and in cities all over the world because it's
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:02.400]  all connected to the same problem. And it'll happen here in the UK, of course, more obviously
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:09.000]  in the short term. And that's what the martial law buildup is mainly for is just the clamp
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.240]  down and taking everybody's private bank accounts and the boy scouts serving in FEMA brigades.
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.240]  I mean, it's just...
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.480]  Well, we have an example of it here in the UK this week. There's a bank called Coop Bank.
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:27.040]  It wasn't big enough to be too big to fail. So instead they're going to do a bail-in.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.720]  So the bondholders of the bank are going to have to pony up some cash. So this is another
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.120]  trend we've seen in the last couple of years. If you're part of the too big to fail bank,
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.640]  then the government bails out the bondholders and you're sweet. If you're not part of that
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.120]  club, then it could be in Cyprus, it could be part of the Coop Bank, it could be part
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.200]  of some other bank or country, and therefore you get your wealth confiscated. So wealth
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:55.960]  confiscation is a trend that became very obvious with Cyprus and now it's getting growing in
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.560]  different regions. They're talking about it in Japan. Remember 10 months ago or 11 months
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:06.040]  ago when I said that there's this global bond apocalypse on the horizon, I said the number
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:14.280]  one trigger for this would be Japan. And since that time we have had a huge economic volatility
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:21.240]  happening in Japan as that market goes through a gut-wrenching bond collapse as well as a
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.000]  stock market volatility. So we're seeing it happen there because they've had two decades
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:31.920]  of what they call lost decade. They can't stimulate using debt and they can't export
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:38.800]  their way into into growth. So this could be the sinkhole around which all these other
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:42.560]  Yeah, you did say a year ago it would start in Japan and much of what you predicted is
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:46.240]  now starting to happen. I'm talking about short term, mid term, long term. What do you
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:52.040]  think is going to happen next? Gold and a lot more. We're on the march. The Empire's

[01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:42.360]  revolution against criminal revolutionaries that got control in nineteen thirteen of the
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:47.120]  issuance of our currency and have now gotten control of most of our society?
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.760]  They've been dumbing us down for a long time. What do you do when they publicly run Al Qaeda
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:58.220]  and are giving a missiles and Saudi Arabia says, give them more missiles, which is just
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:05.280]  the cover to claim they gave them the missiles they really got from Benghazi. And I see articles
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:12.480]  like this all the time here in the US now. Here's one out of WHAM television man charged
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.960]  after corralling suspected vandals in a closet.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.160]  He came in where they done forty thousand dollars worth of damage. They've been indicted
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:23.520]  for that with a hammer, knocking holes in the wall. He grabbed the hammer away and said,
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:36.520]  wait here for police. And he's now been indicted. He's now been charged. So that's how. A Wayne
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:41.520]  County man is now facing charges for charges of endangering the welfare of a child after
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.400]  interrupted an act of vandalism.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:49.520]  See, he didn't even touch any of them. But you don't have a right to citizens arrest
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.760]  now. In England, again, if you fight back with your fist with someone trying to stab
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:59.080]  you in your home, they will, even if you get stabbed and you beat them up, they will indict
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:04.880]  you, throw you in prison because there's nothing more evil than a citizen defending themselves.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:13.760]  That's the great crime to a criminal government. To a nanny state. I want to get this guy on
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.760]  the show.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:19.600]  And then I've got all this other NSA news about how they retinas can kids all over the
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.320]  country when they get on the school bus and don't tell the parents. Same thing was done
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.840]  in England a few years ago. It's a global unified program of just the good fellows that
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.680]  are a bunch of corporate crooks taking over.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:35.300]  So, Max, let me ask you this question. Break it down in layman terms. What do you expect
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:42.400]  to see now in the economy? How bad will it get? And what other rabbits can they pull?
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:48.760]  You mentioned some of those. What will that do? And how do you, looking out in the future,
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:52.920]  how do you expect this in your gut to end? What does Max Keiser thinks really going to
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.920]  happen?
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:36:01.840]  Well, the two important numbers are inflation and the rate at which wages are growing. We
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:07.960]  know wages are flat to contracting adjusted for inflation. Real wages haven't grown in
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:14.640]  10 years. But inflation is growing. So the government says it's running at 2.5% to 3%
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.400]  here in the U.S. or the U.K. But if you look at the price of what stuff really buy, gasoline,
[01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:29.040]  food, etc., it's running at 8, 9, 9%. So that trend is where people make direct contact
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.640]  with how these policies are hurting them. Their dollars are losing purchasing power
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:42.360]  and their standard of living is decreasing. And they don't have any wage growth to offset
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:50.160]  that. And that trend will continue. Over the past 50 years or so, there was a bit of a
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.080]  correlation between stock prices and wages. A lot of times you would see stock prices
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:37:01.640]  go up and wages would go up. But this past five years during the stock market rally that
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:08.660]  has made many billionaires many, many times richer, wages have stayed flat. So the financial
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:14.120]  engineers have perfected a technique where they can increase asset values, that is to
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:20.960]  say stocks and stuff like art, fine art, yachts, etc., things that the billionaires buy. They
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:26.720]  figured out a way to get those prices to keep going higher without increasing wages. So
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.680]  that's been the experiment that's been on for 30 years. They finally have perfected
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:36.400]  this. So there's no reason to stop because the cost of labor is not gonna go higher no
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.960]  matter how much money they print to put in their own pocket. Wages are just not gonna
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  go higher.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:51.120]  Exactly, it's an inflation only in luxury goods. Everything else is imploding and then
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:56.800]  they'll just, people will only have jobs as cops or prison guards and so we go into the
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:01.300]  gulag economy. It's all been, well Rand Corporation, as you know, wrote about it 50 years ago.
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:02.600]  They've really done a great job.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:11.360]  Yeah, there's no way that wages are ever gonna match inflation in the foreseeable future.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:18.240]  So you know, and of course the unions which were in place to defend the worker, they've
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.880]  been completely destroyed. Now of course you can say, well the unions are run by corrupt
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.520]  union officials. That's true. I mean, union officials have done a lot to destroy the unions.
[01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.480]  But nevertheless, now you have a situation where there's absolutely no one lobbying on
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:40.840]  behalf of workers at all. There's nobody lobbying for workers, for wages. I've said, and this
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:49.080]  is true economically, that if you simply paid out wages to workers and you tripled or quadrupled
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:54.640]  the minimum wage and financed it with the same 0% interest rates from the Federal Reserve
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.920]  that Citibank can get or Lloyd's at London can get, then you could have an economy that
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:06.360]  was growing both from workers and asset owners. But they don't wanna do that. They don't wanna
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  share anything.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]  Sure.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  They just want to
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.360]  Sure, what's the plan
[01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:16.720]  What's the plan to bring in 30 million illegals? I mean, the globalists are all for it, Republicans
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.920]  and Democrats. I just look at it and say, I can't go to Mexico and have a baby for free.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:27.280]  I can't get on welfare there. I'm all for workers to this country and I'm all for immigrants.
[01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:32.760]  My issue is, is that they are now basically corporate minions and are gonna be used to
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.720]  drive down wages even further and that that's the goal.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:43.160]  Right. Cheap labor. This, of course, is the goal. Cheap labor is desirable. And as long
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:48.200]  as these people have no rights, as long as they are one step out of prison or, you know,
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:52.400]  the biggest working population in America right now are actually prisoners because there
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:57.920]  was an overturn of a law recently that made it legal once again to outsource labor to
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:07.160]  prison. And not only are judges throwing kids into prison on spurious claims to feed the
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.400]  prison industrial complex, but now they're putting people in prison because that's now
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.640]  become a cheap source of labor.
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:18.080]  Now, this is a complete repudiation of laws against slave labor. So slavery is legal in
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.600]  America. Anyone who thinks that slavery was outlawed is wrong. Slavery is completely legal
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.320]  in America again.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.400]  I totally agree. In fact, when you see them passing a law where even many wooden pipes
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.640]  says some wooden pipes are OK. But if you read the definition of hookahs and things,
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:40.760]  it's not. We're a felony to have a pipe. And then you see stuff where they tell the kid
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.680]  take your NRA shirt off.
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.240]  But the school didn't have a code against, you know, non profane lettering. So they charge
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:53.480]  him with the gun on his shirt being a terroristic threat. And then they tell kids at commencements
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:59.240]  that they can't thank God when that's their free speech, whether you believe in God or
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:00.240]  not.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.600]  I mean, I just see cases every day of how wildly authoritarian things are and how the
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:13.520]  law is designed to let violent offenders go, but keep the nonviolent people actually in
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:18.440]  the prisons working for 25 cents an hour. That's how they legalize slavery, is they
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.760]  just pass a bunch of laws now where zero point five, that's half a beer.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.240]  You know, you're going to get a felony now and go to jail. They want all of us in the
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]  system.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.520]  All right. Well, the country with the biggest prison population in the world is the United
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:38.480]  States, bigger than China, bigger than any country in the world. It's the United States
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.840]  because it's such a hugely profitable, profitable business. And the thing about the Second Amendment
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.200]  or gun rights is that it's a hot button issue. So a lot of people will be out there defending
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.920]  their Second Amendment rights, but sacrifice their first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth Amendment
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:42:01.480]  rights. So it's very unbalanced. In the pro-gun debate, it's unbalanced in that people are
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:05.540]  willing to defend their Second Amendment rights, but sacrifice their First Amendment right
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:10.360]  or the third or fourth Amendment rights. So there is a bit of a confusion, I think, in
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:17.040]  the overall pushback against this NSA PRISM-style gulag state. Remember, the prison gulag state
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.880]  needs a PRISM to make it work. And now we know, thanks to Edward Snowden, that there
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:27.960]  is a PRISM. You should change the name of PRISM planet to PRISM planet because now we
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:35.940]  all live in this NSA PRISM dome of perpetual surveillance. And I thought the interview
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:40.120]  with Edward Snowden today was pretty interesting in that he touched on a lot of very interesting
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  points.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:49.120]  And I am in the camp that gives him 100% credibility along with Glenn Greenwald. So there is at
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.720]  least a few people out there who have managed to blow the whistle, come forward, and give
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.000]  the administration some hot flashes.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.480]  Well, I love how over and over again, we see Cheney and neocons come out and say, arrest
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.320]  this guy. He's a traitor. He must work for the Chinese. These are the guys that transferred
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.840]  our missile secrets, our reactor secrets, our technology, our jobs bipartisanly, the
[01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:20.320]  Democrats are involved as well, to Communist China because they could get fat cat state
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.520]  guaranteed deals with them.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:27.560]  Now they're busy selling off. I was watching this morning, CNBC, like I said, and even
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.440]  the hosts were like, my God, they're buying up the entire infrastructure because America
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.800]  sold out. MIT has come out and admitted that the jobs are never coming back because we
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:41.340]  sold out the infrastructure. The elite here will no longer be the elite.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:46.800]  They were so greedy, they even destroyed their own command base, Max Keiser. And so my point
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:54.040]  is, it's so rich how this military industrial complex talks about how it's taking our rights
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:59.600]  to protect us when everybody knows they run Al-Qaeda, they run the Chai Coms, everything
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.600]  bad, they run it.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:07.360]  Well, you make a good point there that the Chinese of the world are pointing to foreign
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:13.720]  powers and saying we need to protect ourselves against them invading. Well, at the same time,
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:20.200]  he's cutting deals with the exact same foreign powers to buy huge pieces of America's infrastructure.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:27.380]  China in particular is buying up big pieces of American industry as are other countries
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.240]  around the world. And the reason why they're cutting deals now is because of the huge debt
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:36.600]  that America has, that they realize that the only way they can settle this debt is to sell
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:42.120]  off these big pieces of the infrastructure. And you see, you saw this in Greece. Greece
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:49.200]  was a country that before Goldman Sachs and John Paulson and Papandreou, the prime minister
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:54.760]  got involved, it was a $400 billion economy. It was determined that it wasn't that big
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.440]  of an economy. It was, after all, maybe only two times the size of IBM or two times the
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.800]  size of Berkshire Hathaway. And you could effectively do a leveraged buyout of Greece,
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.280]  and that's exactly what they did. They went in there, they flooded it with lots of bad
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:12.000]  debt. They transferred that debt to the government. The government then transferred that debt
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.880]  to the people through austerity. The economy has collapsed, and now they're selling off
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:21.040]  the assets. A few weeks ago for the first time, one of the Greek islands was sold to
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:28.200]  a cutter, one of the top guys in Qatar, the Emir of Qatar. And that opened the floodgates
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:32.400]  for these kleptocrats and oligarchs to start buying these Greek islands.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:39.080]  Just like Detroit created taxes that ran everybody out, set up this corrupt bureaucracy, and
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:43.640]  now they're fully collapsing. That is the model, but I think this is so out of control
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:47.640]  they may not get away with it. Let me show TV viewers and radio listeners a couple articles
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:54.880]  here. The New York Times, police officers arrested a protester in Istanbul on Sunday,
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:58.620]  the same day Prime Minister rallied supporters.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:03.100]  So he was allowed to have people come out and rally for him. But people that just rallied
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:08.560]  to keep the only park in the city, the only green space open where they play soccer, it
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.100]  shows the police, it looks like breaking the guy's arm. You can see they've twisted it
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:18.600]  back so far. No way that didn't break. And stomping him in the head, and the New York
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:25.080]  Times goes with police arrest. See, everything is propaganda. Let's go to the next article.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:33.000]  For many, no penalty for crimes, drunk driving, shoplifting, breaking in homes. The police,
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.760]  it says they made the decision to not arrest for petty crimes.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.240]  Meanwhile, the code is illegal aliens, folks. It's illegal aliens that don't arrest. And
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.520]  again, though, citizens get pulled over with no seat belt. You go to jail in Austin, and
[01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:53.160]  they throw the book at you because we're seen as milk cows, Max Keiser.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.840]  Yeah, well, I think it's important for people to understand that when you talk about the
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.820]  New York Times, you're talking about a captured journalistic enterprise. They are not giving
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:13.000]  you unbiased truth. This is an institution that's gone horribly wrong. So has all of
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.600]  the big media outlets in the US. I mean, your show is delivering great information with
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.400]  the Texas Twister. You know, this is what most people don't understand in the foreign
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:33.400]  press, that in America now, the media landscape is so horrid and so decrepit and so immoral
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:39.520]  that the only way you can get through the prison of lies is through this grenade approach,
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.400]  which if you get past the first couple of shockwaves, you end up getting lots and lots
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.920]  of really great information. So we want to thank you for that. And again, I will repeat
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:54.200]  that wherever I go in the world, people always say, oh, yeah, I heard you on Alex Jones.
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:57.520]  Not that they heard me on the BBC or they heard me on this other outlet. They say, oh,
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:01.400]  I heard you on Alex Jones. So you've got this huge global audience with people waking up
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.080]  to this. And it's sad, though, that the country that's the most to lose is the United States,
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.260]  the people of the United States. They were holding all the cards. And now they've given
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:14.880]  it all back to the people like Dick Cheney. And Dick Cheney, if there's a traitor in
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:19.580]  the mix, it's not Edward Snowden. It's Dick Cheney. Look at Dick Cheney's track record
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:26.480]  and selling America's freedom down the rat hole for what, a few extra dollars? What was
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:31.480]  his incentive? Is he that shallow? Is he that callous that he would just blow America higher?
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:35.280]  Well, that's even what the big Pentagon war planners say is they're getting weight. The
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:39.520]  military industrial complex and the banks, they have one thing, profit, but it's even
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:43.600]  destroying America's empire in the future. So they're even getting weight. We're going
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:49.360]  to lose the golden goose because Dick Cheney and Bill Clinton and others slaughtered it.
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.560]  It's incredible. We're going to go to break and come back with Max Keiser. And I'm going
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.920]  to find out if we can hold Max a little bit in the next hour to take your economic phone
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.680]  calls. And then I'll open the phones up just for general calls after Max leaves us. But
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.100]  he may have to leave in ten minutes. So we'll see if this is the final segment when we come
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:05.800]  back with Max Keiser.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:09.980]  I'll ask him during the break, but I just want callers to understand something. We have
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:16.000]  a normalcy bias in this country to basically put up with anything. We've gotten to where
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.800]  we're in a position where we'll put up with almost anything. And it's time for just across
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:27.680]  the board to stop complying and to realize we're in deep trouble. I mean, I fundamentally
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.720]  think about my children every day and try to figure out ways to fix this country so
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.920]  they have a future.
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.560]  And then get angry that it's a global government and that I can't leave. I mean, we're cornered.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:44.760]  We've got to get out of here. The only way to beat this is to bring down the New World
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.680]  Order. They're bringing down free societies to collapse it into their controlled paradigm
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.440]  because they're in control. They can do that.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  And it is madness. We're gonna go to break and come back with Max Keiser. Just briefly,
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.680]  the trailer will be out tomorrow. You can pre-order it now. It's only available at infowars.com.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:12.140]  I'm in it. It's State of Mind, The Psychology of Control. It's about the past, the present,
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:13.640]  and the future of mind control.

[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:27.120]  Lie. The film is available in Blu-ray and DVD right now. And it's got everybody, a bunch
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:32.760]  of doctors and scientists and G. Edward Griffin and Colonel Shaffer and myself and so many
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:38.320]  others. So state of mind, the psychology of control. And for the first 5,000 people that
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.840]  ordered it, that sounds like a lot, it's not, you will get free the film exposing the private
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:48.280]  fellow reserve, the American dream. I have 5,000 of these when they're gone. That's it.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:52.080]  We never offer a new film with something free out of the gates. But I'm doing this now because
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:51:01.240]  state of mind is so important. Order it today. Infowarsstore.com. Infowarsstore.com.

[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:10.400]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.760]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:19.240]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:24.160]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:29.040]  mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.480]  of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:38.320]  food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed
[01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:42.160]  you. Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from

[01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:49.440]  are some of the headlines up on infowars.com. Ron Paul is saying Obama's Syria policy looks
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:57.320]  a lot like Bush's Iraq policy. Max Keiser, the collapse of the current Manchester regime
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:02.960]  is upon us. He breaks that down. Journalist says TSA shamed my teenage daughter. Russian
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:10.600]  tycoon predicts immortality within 25 years. 14-year-old faces year in jail over pro-gun
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:15.760]  t-shirt. They say the image of the rifle is a terroristic threat, a thought crime. The
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:24.920]  next NSA snooping shoot a drop pre-crime and it just goes on and on from there. Oh, and
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:28.840]  the French government's coming out and saying, look, we met with Britain two years ago about
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  launching this current war. That's because the war started two years ago against Syria.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:38.160]  Max, you were telling me you've got some breaking news dealing with McDonald's. Tell us about
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160]  it.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:44.520]  Oh yeah, this just came out. McDonald's is now being sued by one of their workers because
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:51.320]  they've got a deal with JP Morgan where their payroll goes directly into a JP Morgan account
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:59.720]  and JP Morgan then charges people $1.50 to use the ATM. Then they charge them $1 to just
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:05.920]  see what their balance is for a balance inquiry. They charge them $0.75 per online bill payment
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:08.680]  and $15 for a lost car.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:12.000]  And they forced them to use that bank. I mean, that is slavery.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Wow.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000]  That is?
[01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  Yeah.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.800]  And that's what they're going to do when they get their cashflow society completely in place.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.800]  They've said it.
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.360]  Yeah. I mean, in other words, getting back to what we were saying before, wages are never
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:31.440]  going to go up. I mean, they can raise the minimum wage to $8 or $9 or $10, but JP Morgan
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:37.080]  will just raise their fees by $1 an hour, $2 an hour, and they'll just put that money
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.240]  directly into JP Morgan's pocket. That's what we've seen now post crash of 2000.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:47.560]  And that was my next point. You said this years ago, it's now on record. The NSA is
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:53.360]  there to give private companies intelligence on how to game the economy, the stock market,
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:57:00.000]  LIBOR, all of it. And that came out last week that indeed NSA is using this data to corner
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.760]  markets. I mean, it's incredible. They are waging war against real economies.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:13.080]  Well, there's a scandal of high frequency trading. The traders who use this high frequency
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.280]  trading, they're trading a billion times per second on the New York Stock Exchange and
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.480]  other exchanges. They say that they're adding liquidity and they're making a market. Now
[01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:30.160]  it comes out that the regulators are releasing prices at a fraction of a second before they
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:36.520]  do release to the public to give insiders insider information. Then that came out about
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:42.440]  the same time that the NSA PRISM story broke. So that confirms now. And also for Congress,
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.240]  congressional aides and others in Washington, insider trading is legal. It has not been
[01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:51.080]  outlawed. Here you have an NSA with unlimited computer
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:56.800]  power and 360 degree spy presence with a high frequency trader on Wall Street that totally
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:04.160]  captured all the regulators who are trading on inside information. So that's why the economy
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:09.960]  is the way it is. That's why people can't make enough to get ahead of inflation while
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:17.000]  simultaneously the top 5,000 people, their billionaires are increasing at 30 or 40 percent
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.200]  a year. That's how you do it. Stay there, Max Keiser, because here's the
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:25.480]  rest of the story. We're going to get your take on this when we come back. The globalist
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:32.000]  are then funding socialism and fake grassroots communism to then scapegoat the giant poor
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.400]  mass off against what's left of the middle class to usher in total social control and
[01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:46.560]  government engineering out of the crisis. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNlive.com

[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:27.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.680]  number three, taking your phone calls for the next half hour. Then I'm going to get
[02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:40.520]  into the rest of the news I've not yet covered. And take your phone calls. Look at this, Sesame
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:48.540]  Street says P is for prison, and that's okay. Everything, they show police stomping some
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:56.600]  guy and breaking his arm on the cover of the New York Times and say, police, arrest a protester.
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:02.240]  Looks like they just are preparing us for total enslavement. And all the kleptocratic
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.760]  class and the media and the government corporations think it's going to protect them. I'll get
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.280]  Max Keiser's take on that and more coming up. But right now, let's go to calls as promised
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:15.600]  for Max Keiser. Mike in Oregon, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:20.480]  Hey guys, how's it going? I just want to thank you a lot for getting me on the show.
[02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:21.480]  Thank you, brother.
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:28.120]  Yeah, no problem. Hey, Max, I'm a guy who's making about $12,000, $13,000 a year. What
[02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:33.400]  can I do as a small investor to give my money more purchase power? Should I invest into
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.720]  prison places or defense contractors? I was going to see what take I can get from you
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:41.120]  on which way to go.
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:48.880]  Well, that's a good question because the way the economy is set up is it forces people
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:53.640]  to pick sides like this. And it's just like Nazi Germany. People knew that people were
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.960]  being sent to the gas oven, but they were benefiting from the gold that was being extracted
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.600]  from the teeth and the clothes that were being stolen and the wealth that was being stolen.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:08.040]  And this is sad that in America, people have to make this choice that they don't get paid
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.760]  adequately. So with the money they do get paid, should they invest in Monsanto, the
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:17.400]  agricultural terrorists? Should they invest in Corrections Core of America, the prison
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.200]  Gulag industrial complex? Should they invest in Microsoft, the copyright terrorist? It's
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:27.320]  sad, but I hear what you're saying. And I can't say it's a bad idea because ultimately
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.480]  you have to think of your family's survival. So that means putting a few extra dollars
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:37.120]  to work. I mean, I just, you know, if Al Qaeda could go public on the New York Stock Exchange
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.640]  and give people in America the same way to make money in Al Qaeda that Obama does, that
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:46.720]  Cheney does, that Donald Rumsfeld does, I think that would be a lot fairer.
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:50.720]  That's right. Well, Al Qaeda is only for them to do insider trading, to start wars and stuff.
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.200]  That's right. But why can't they do Al Qaeda, an offering on the New York Stock Exchange?
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.500]  You know, the symbol could be AQ. Well, wait a minute. They did. They did seven years ago.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:05.180]  They came out with a trading thing on terrorism. Yeah. The policy analysis market based on
[02:03:05.180 --> 02:03:10.640]  my technology and they, John Poindexter introduced it. They quickly shut it down, but they do
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:15.760]  it now insiders. I'm saying they need to make that available to the public and allow people
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:20.600]  to invest directly into Al Qaeda, because they're now employing Al Qaeda to kill people
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:21.600]  in Syria.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:25.320]  I mean, Americans need the opportunity to make the same amount of profits in Al Qaeda
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:32.680]  that Rumsfeld and Obama and Cheney and Biden are doing. I think that's only fair.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:39.760]  You know, that's what's so insane about all of this, Max, is that I study this 18 hours
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:45.560]  a day, as I know you do. And it's so crazy. I can't even believe it at this point. And
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:50.120]  it only gets crazier each day. I appreciate your call, Mike. We're going to come back
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.620]  and take more calls here.
[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:58.360]  My phone just went crazy and just answered and just went nuts. My phone was just sitting
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:06.480]  here and it just picked up and went to some kind of crazy. Wasn't even touching it. My
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:13.200]  phone has just gone completely insane. Guys, will you take my phone out of the room, please?
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:21.960]  Thank you. I'm going to try to reset my thought and find out that that was bizarre.
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.840]  It's like the announcement that they're going to have government forced announcements over
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.880]  your phones. NSA two way. I'm going to try to come back and I'm talking about how the
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:32.780]  world's gotten so bizarre and crazy. I can't even deal with it anymore. My phone just starts
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:40.640]  like making like I was on the top of a mountain or something.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.600]  And I'm sure it's just a glitch. Let me reset there and come back with Max Keiser to try
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:51.400]  to ask that question again and go to Jay, Kathy, Brendan, Paul and many others. Told
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:57.080]  free number to join us. Eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one. Welcome to

[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:11.800]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:16.040]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:21.000]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.

[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:12.600]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:18.080]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and

[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:21.880]  I got it. Watch me. I got it. Hey, I got something that makes me want to shout. I got something
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:35.240]  that tells me what it's all about. I got sold and I'm super bad. I got sold and I'm super
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:40.560]  bad. Monday through Friday. We're here, folks. Weekdays twelve noon to three p.m. Eastern.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:45.880]  We have info Wars Nightly News seven o'clock every evening. As we went to break, I was
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.220]  trying to get the question out to Max Keiser before we go back to your calls. He joins
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:09:00.200]  us now from the UK, a great financial and geopolitical analyst, in my view, that I study
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.200]  this stuff.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:05.780]  I don't want to exaggerate. I don't work as hard as I used to. Maybe 16 hours a day. Some
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:13.080]  days I work 20 hours a day, but on average about 16 hours a day. And I mean, I know I'm
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:20.120]  telling the truth. I know I'm very accurate. I know as crazy as this show sounds that unfortunately
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:26.960]  I'm overall telling the truth. I'm trying to tell the truth. I try to disprove what
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.760]  I'm saying and it just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:34.840]  So I look out into the future. Yes, the technocrats have the NSA spying and have all the economic
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:40.480]  insider data. And yes, they've got these militaries and yes, they've got. But I talked to the
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.900]  military. Most of them are waking up. I talked to the public. They're waking up. Confidence
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:50.400]  in newspapers is an all time record lows. Confidence in Obama, all time low. 17 points
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:52.720]  lost last month by under 30s.
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:59.240]  I mean, he's just imploding. Congress lowest approval rating of 10% ever. I've seen one
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:06.440]  of nine, but Salon and others and Breitbart say it's 10. Gallup says that's the lowest
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.920]  ever. So there's some positive things, but it's kind of like Greece or Spain or Mexico.
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:16.640]  You know the government's corrupt, but it just kind of settles into the police wear
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:17.640]  black mask.
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:22.820]  You're a slave. Sewage runs down the street. And then up on the hill and palaces, the rich
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:30.240]  people live up there. And so is there a way to extricate ourselves from this madness?
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.480]  Because I mean, things are getting crazy so much faster. It's almost like a quickening
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:41.440]  or a singularity of corruption. Max, do you see a light at the end of the tunnel, a way
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:45.160]  to get out of this? And if we don't, how do you see it ending?
[02:10:45.160 --> 02:10:52.560]  Well, I thought it was very interesting referring back to the Edward Snowden comments today.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:11:00.000]  When asked about encryption, he said that encryption does work. Encryption does keep
[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.640]  the stoops at bay. And immediately it got me thinking again about Bitcoin, which is
[02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:14.040]  a cryptocurrency, a completely encrypted currency. And I really believe that this is going to
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:22.420]  help us get to the promised land by having an economy outside of the Wall Street's ability
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:30.280]  to corrupt it. And that doesn't say that Bitcoin can't be used in levered products. I'm sure
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:35.280]  at some point it will. But the underlying source code of Bitcoin is incorruptible thanks
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.440]  to the genius of its creation, which I think is going to go down in history as one of the
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:47.640]  most ingenious inventions ever, right there with the light bulb and a few other ingenious
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:54.360]  inventions. And so I think that Bitcoin is, came at the right time. It's a path to salvation.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:59.320]  It came out to put too rosy a glow on it. And we had confirmation today from Edward
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:03.560]  Snowden that encryption does work. It is a powerful force against government intrusion.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:08.640]  Well, what it makes them do is have to spend more time cracking it. And so we shouldn't
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:13.720]  just make it easy for them. And we shouldn't use Facebook. We shouldn't use Twitter. I
[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:19.280]  use it, but as a way to jack in and fight the system. But as a general public, Google,
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:26.240]  all of it, whatever you can do using a proxy like startpage.com, whatever you can do to
[02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:28.200]  not make it easy on them is key.
[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:35.040]  My problem is we run advertising and the last three companies that we've used to run our
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:41.000]  advertising software get bought by Google. So Max, what do you do when the monopoly just
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:45.360]  buys everything up? I think that goes back to the last caller saying, what do you do
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:50.760]  when they own the whole economy and it's impossible to even operate outside of their system? That's
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.440]  what Monsanto and all of them admit they're going for.
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:59.920]  Yeah, I admit that that's a growing problem because the money used to buy up all the assets
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:05.120]  is gifted to them through zero percent interest rates. And that's one of the problems of having
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:10.040]  zero percent interest rates, at least it wasn't called malinvestment. There are malinvestments
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:14.680]  for society at large. It's great if you're an insider and a kleptocrat, but if you're
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.800]  somebody who's not, it really has to be classified as a malinvestment. But we are, as I point
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:26.760]  out in my article for Infowars today, exclusive I might add, there is also crowdfunding, which
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:33.320]  is interesting because you are bypassing the usual routes of money raising and a lot of
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:38.380]  interesting projects are now being financed using crowdfunding platforms, which are outside
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:43.720]  of the machinations of Wall Street. So I think that's another alternative economic model
[02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:47.760]  that's rising. If you combine the two with Bitcoin and crowdfunding, which is something
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.960]  that's an interesting combination, I think that that would be a powerful force. It requires
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:58.040]  a lot of out-of-the-box thinking, a lot of technologically aware thinking, and I just
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:04.360]  don't want to throw in the towel and say that we're all going to be living in this NSA pre-crime
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:10.920]  bubble of casino gulagism. I mean, I have to hold out some hope that ingenuity and people
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:16.560]  like Edward Snowden, in my mind, and Glenn Greenwald, I mean, this is what America has
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:24.440]  produced. They've produced at least two people that embody the spirit of the founding fathers.
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:29.880]  There's at least two, Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald. So at least we have two people
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:37.880]  carrying the torch of America 238 years later. Maybe they'll get to a place where they can
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:42.400]  start to beat back and force down these internal cutors, these-
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.120]  Sure, I don't want to hog you anymore. I want to go to these phone calls for you. But you
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:52.160]  were mentioning at the end of the last hour how McDonald's made a deal, there's a lawsuit
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:58.120]  over this, with one of the big private central banks to put their money only in that account
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.640]  and then charge them money to be able to look at their money or get money out, which is
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:05.500]  a form of total slavery.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:09.120]  And that's out of the Philadelphia Daily News, but here's another one. Sesame Street says
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:13.400]  P is for prison and that's okay. And then during the break, I was going and reading
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:19.200]  the transcript of the shows, the new Sesame Street shows. It teaches the kids how to become
[02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:24.240]  prisoners and how that's their future, and how to drink and have guns and all this stuff.
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:29.200]  I mean, everything is a primer. I saw a few months ago where in New Mexico and other states
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:35.160]  they have, whatever Wackenhut's new name is, I forget the exact headline, in there as school
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:41.360]  security priming the kids for prison. And you have deals with the states saying, we
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:47.440]  promise to put this many people in prison if you'll move to our state.
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.840]  I mean, it's incredible. We have a bigger prison population than anybody in the world.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.200]  Well, you're referring to Corrections Corps of America. They made a deal with several
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:01.360]  states, several municipalities, where they will take over the cost of running the prison
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:06.680]  for those states if the state guarantees 98% occupancy. Of course, the only way that they
[02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:09.920]  can guarantee that is if they just make a lot of arrests until a lot of people in prison,
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:17.680]  regardless of any due process. But that was okay for many states in America and many municipalities.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:21.720]  It's just amazing. They're engineering the economy into this predatory system. And no
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.680]  wonder a lot of cops walk around and act like goons. That's who they want. That's who they're
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:31.920]  hiring. Let's go to Jay. He wants to talk about the big sign of the crash. Jay, you're
[02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:32.920]  on the air with Max Keiser.
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:38.720]  Hey, gentlemen, real pleasure to speak with you. Hey, listen, being as it's, I believe
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:44.360]  we're just about at the end. The Constitution is literally hanging by a thread. My question
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:49.440]  is, what is the sign financially, at least for you guys, that's going to say, you know
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:52.320]  what, that's it. I'm packing up. I'm heading out.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.320]  Well, I've decided to go down with a ship. I'm taking 100% of the profits that come in
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:17:03.360]  here, 100% and putting them. I mean, I haven't paid myself in a long time into trying to
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.560]  build this operation in the face of it. I have hope. I believe we can turn the tide.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.200]  Look at how many people are waking up. And I have hope what Max just said that people
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:15.740]  in the system are going to show some more courage because I'm here to tell you, folks,
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:22.080]  your kids out there have no future if so many yuppies and businessmen and smart people think
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.120]  they're safe on the sidelines.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:28.720]  Think again. Max Keiser, what's the sign for you that the implosion is about to accelerate?
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:34.840]  Well, two signs. I mean, as we talked about, it's over.
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:40.120]  Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Max, your phone cut out. Go ahead and say that again.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:47.700]  It's one, two, sir. Okay, we're going to have to reconnect with
[02:17:47.700 --> 02:17:53.880]  Max Keiser. Jay, I appreciate your call. I'm going to try to get his point on that. Look,
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:58.560]  the Pentagon admits now they're gearing up for economic disaster. We had an article last
[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:03.760]  week that Drudge Report linked to where Homeland Security DHS is buying all this riot gear
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.560]  and putting them in pre-placed caches all over the country.
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:13.000]  And you say, hey, it looks like the derivatives are going to implode and there's no way to
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.600]  pay them back. It's not our debt. You're gearing up for martial law. Here's your training manual.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:25.160]  Your enemy's the tea party? Your enemy's gun owners? Veterans, really? And they're like,
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:33.160]  yeah. So we have Max back, his phone degraded. What are the signs again, Max Keiser?
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.880]  Yeah, hopefully you can hear me. Just a couple of things. One is interest rates as they go
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:42.960]  up. That's a sign, not of growth, but of bond panic, as I've been saying for a few months.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:49.760]  And then you saw a story last week, 10,000 people lined up in China at a shop to buy
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:54.840]  gold. So even though gold has been trending down in price, it hasn't scared people out
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:19:00.320]  of gold. It has encouraged thousands, tens of thousands of people in China and elsewhere
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.120]  outside of the American echo chamber to be buying physical gold. That's a huge sign that
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:09.080]  should tell you volumes about where this thing is going.
[02:19:09.080 --> 02:19:14.760]  Absolutely. We're going to go to break and come back with a final segment with Max Keiser.
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:20.920]  I'll try to go to your calls quickly for Kathy and Brendan and Paul have been holding the
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:25.680]  longest and I'll get to everybody else after that break and get to stacks of news that's
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:31.240]  broke since I got on air. Plus all the rest of the news, maxkeiser.com is his website

[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:05.880]  Hello, this is Ty Bolinger, author of the bestselling book cancer step outside the box.
[02:20:05.880 --> 02:20:11.680]  I want you to know some very important information in 1985 president Ronald Reagan requested
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:15.960]  that carnivore be sent directly to the white house at a time when only the president could
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:21.440]  obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:25.880]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:31.720]  this age of super bugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal
[02:20:31.720 --> 02:20:36.580]  cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your
[02:20:36.580 --> 02:20:40.740]  chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that
[02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:46.760]  don't belong in your body. Call one eight six six Venus fly or order from carnivore.com

[02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:03.600]  It's the only one you've got. In the last two years alone, the U S has seen huge losses
[02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:09.240]  to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the U S costing us 20 billion
[02:21:09.240 --> 02:21:14.520]  in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.400]  You may think out of sight out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:23.880]  fact is you are, we all are food shortages, drive prices up for everyone. You might not
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:28.280]  be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:32.640]  cost and availability of your food supply with the foods direct. Be prepared before
[02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:37.080]  you need it. With nutrient dense food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope
[02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:41.400]  for the best, but hope won't feed you do what I've done and get your own supply of the best

[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:08.520]  nearly two years, I suffered severe hot flashes, which prevented me from sleeping all night.
[02:22:08.520 --> 02:22:12.920]  It was so hard to work because it continued all day to have the hot flashes from hell.
[02:22:12.920 --> 02:22:18.920]  I was exhausted and depleted after only three weeks on one world weight. I have no hot flashes
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:24.560]  and I'm sleeping normally again. I feel energized and strong. This is an amazing product. It
[02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:28.520]  is a little known fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:33.960]  its protein content as glutathione, but due to toxicity and aging, it does not. Could
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:38.320]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire body? If you
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:42.640]  restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells, especially your glands and organs,
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:47.240]  then as a result, your glands and organs work better. Imagine the quality of life improvement

[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:24.680]  Ben Bernanke is a little devil. Real quick question number one, right after these calls,
[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:31.400]  Max Keiser. Do you expect the Federal Reserve to start tapering, giving themselves unlimited
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:35.580]  free cash? I mean, the markets are acting like they believe that's happening. Or will
[02:24:35.580 --> 02:24:44.520]  they continue the pumping? They will definitely continue until there's a bond crash. So why
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:50.280]  are the markets going down in anticipation of a tapering? Because the Federal Reserve
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:57.760]  likes to play the market and they trade on inside information. They tell people beforehand,
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.840]  Bernanke tells people, Okay, I'm going to talk about tapering. And everyone played a
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:06.640]  piggybacks trade. And then they'll come back and say, Oh, no, I spoke too soon. And then
[02:25:06.640 --> 02:25:11.080]  everyone piggybacks that trade. Exactly. So it's milking the schmucks. Yeah, oh, yeah,
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:15.720]  absolutely. I did it myself many, many times. It's just exactly what a stockbroker does
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.520]  to milk their clients but done on a multi trillion dollar level. It's exactly the same
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.000]  game any broker does with their clients. They scare them into selling and then get their
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.400]  greed up to buy. It's just the same exact thing but a multi trillion dollar. Unbelievable.
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:37.800]  Kathy, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Hello, Max. I'm from South
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:43.200]  Carolina. And the reason I'm calling today is because we had a tuberculosis outbreak
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:50.360]  in a county here in South Carolina. And patient A was medically detained by the Department
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:55.200]  of Health and Environmental Control. Apparently, there was a new law in 2011 that allows them
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:59.560]  to do that. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let people in from all over the world with leprosy and
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:04.560]  TB. But then once they once they get here and spread it, they're gonna lock you up.
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:13.280]  You have a question for Max on that? Yeah. Max, you want to comment on that? Medical
[02:26:13.280 --> 02:26:20.480]  tyranny? Not really. I mean, it's not really in my specialty but it sounds bad. Yeah, Kathy,
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:24.280]  what do you think about it? Well, it's kind of disturbing to me because I think it sets
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:29.720]  a precedent for just detaining somebody when they say that, okay, well, you have an illness
[02:26:29.720 --> 02:26:31.520]  and now we're going to detain you for 30 days.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.080]  It's very, very dangerous, absolutely. And there's some reasonable reasons for quarantines
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:40.640]  or something like Ebola or something. But they're definitely using medical tyranny as
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:45.760]  an excuse to push things that are far more dangerous. Here's one, Saudi Arabia announces
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:52.120]  four new deaths from Mir's virus. Let's take another call here. Let's talk to Brendan.
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:54.960]  Year on the year with Max Keiser, what's your question?
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:01.600]  Hi Max and Alex. Some of my patrons at my business have become fans of maxkeiser.com
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:07.000]  and infowars.com by trying to disprove what I've told them in the past. However, some
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:14.720]  devotees of Paul Krugman and CNBC and others are eager to tell me, I told you so, regarding
[02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:20.800]  the price of gold. And I wondered if Max could give a nutshell explanation on how the price
[02:27:20.800 --> 02:27:27.080]  is basically at the same price that it costs to extract the gold from the ground and give
[02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:29.680]  a little assurance to those friends of mine who actually,
[02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:33.760]  I mean, I'll say this, they can manipulate gold all day. They're on record doing it.
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:38.200]  They can manipulate the value of gold down for a while, but they're only building a paper
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:43.240]  bubble. I haven't sold any gold I bought and, and, and just tell them, believe in the system
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:45.400]  and just go down with the ship. Max Keiser.
[02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:53.800]  Well, the supply of bonds has never been higher in America's 238 year history. Bonds have
[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:58.560]  never, the supply has never been higher and the yield up until a few weeks ago has never
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:05.080]  been lower. The bond market's in a massive bubble. Gold, on the other hand, the demand
[02:28:05.080 --> 02:28:10.960]  has never been higher, a physical demand, never been higher around the world, a physical
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.640]  demand and the price has pulled in from the high of 1900 back to the year.
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.440]  There are articles bemoaning that the Chinese and Indians and Americans won't sell their
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.960]  gold because there's the real market and then there's the paper market.
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:30.080]  Right. So Paul Krugman is an academic like Ben Bernanke and he'll tell you on paper why
[02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:35.680]  this is this way and this is that way. But the people in China lining up 10,000 strong
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:42.680]  to buy gold don't read his, his white papers. They just see an economy coming to ruin and
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.360]  they are, they're protecting themselves and eventually they will overcome this physical
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:47.360]  barrier. That's right.
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:53.520]  That is the artificial price suppression. And, but the problem is that I want the price
[02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:59.400]  can very easily jump quite dramatically to above the $2,000 level. And then if you're
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:04.280]  not prepared, uh, you know, you, you will have the satisfaction of believing Paul Krugman's
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:09.920]  wrong ideological claptrap for six months, but having not have any, have any gold.
[02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:14.520]  Let's read his exclusive article for info wars.com Kaiser. The collapse of the current
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:20.160]  banks regime is upon us. Uh, it could be true. Max, I'm drafting you. I know your girlfriend,
[02:29:20.160 --> 02:29:23.960]  uh, your, your betrothed is there and you guys want to go to dinner, but do three more
[02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:28.440]  minutes on the other side. I want you to expand on where you think this collapse is going
[02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:32.640]  and talk about gold briefly. Then I'll let you take one more call from Paul who wants
[02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:38.320]  to ask you who controls the world. Then massive news blitz and more calls. We're going in

[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:22.720]  Alright Max, Kaiser's our guest for a few more minutes then I'm going to cover a ton
[02:33:22.720 --> 02:33:27.200]  of news and go back to your phone calls and believe me there is a ton of important news
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:33.740]  so please stay with us here today. Max, in closing, I bought gold when it was 300 bucks
[02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:38.480]  an ounce, didn't sell it when it went up to almost 2,000. I bought silver when it was
[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.960]  $5 an ounce, didn't sell it when it went right up to 50. And if you look at the 12, 15 year
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:51.160]  charts it's only going straight up. But I don't have gold and silver as a investment
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:54.300]  even though it's been a pretty good investment the last decade, one of the best. I have it
[02:33:54.300 --> 02:34:01.280]  as an emergency backup because we've never been awash in so many giant inflationary bubbles.
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:05.840]  Where do you see gold really going and in layman's terms how are they been driving it
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:10.800]  downward? Well first of all, in terms of gold, the alternative
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:16.600]  would be government issued paper. And have we heard anything in the last 2 months, 3
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:21.800]  months, 6 months that would give you more confidence in the government? Does an NSA
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.680]  spying scandal and the PRISM scandal give you more confidence in the government? No,
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:33.260]  it gives me less confidence. So I don't want to be in a government issued piece of paper,
[02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:38.440]  the US dollar or any other fiat currency, that means that leaves only gold, silver and
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:44.440]  bitcoin I put in the same category. Now the number of ounces that I own has not changed,
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:49.560]  whether the price is 1900 or 1500 I have the exact same number of ounces. And going forward
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:55.500]  that's the key, it's not the price but ounces and at some point grams. If you have the same
[02:34:55.500 --> 02:35:01.440]  number of ounces and grams you have some protection against these lunatics. The price is not really
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.400]  the most important thing to consider. Paul Krugman is a guy who defends the status quo,
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:11.520]  the New York Times, he writes for it, defends the government and they want more government
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:15.960]  spending, more government control. That's just not going to work, it didn't work for
[02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:20.580]  Stalin, it didn't work for Pol Pot, it's not going to work for Barack Obama, more government
[02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:27.240]  control is not going to work, I'm sorry. Well you're certainly right about that and at the
[02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:32.620]  same time you're saying you believe this is the beginning of the bond market imploding,
[02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:35.560]  you notice the bond market has been going up and up and up because that's all people
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:41.940]  think is good and you said a year ago that's the sign, how high will the US bond market
[02:35:41.940 --> 02:35:48.100]  go, the treasury market? Okay the last bond collapse we've had was 1994, interest rates
[02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:54.960]  went from 6 to 8% and bonds lost between 20, 25, 26% of their value. Here we're talking
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:36:02.540]  about interest rates going from 2% to 4, 5 and 6%, so doubling or tripling from where
[02:36:02.540 --> 02:36:07.460]  they've been. That means that the bond prices won't lose 20 or 25% of their value, the bond
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:14.440]  prices will lose 50, 60, 70% of their value. That means that all banks are insolvent, that
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.020]  means the government has to come back and print, as we said, 100 trillion dollars to
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:22.620]  bail the bond out. And I know the Fed has made noise about, so the Fed has made noise
[02:36:22.620 --> 02:36:26.100]  in the private Federal Reserve that calls it so federal. The foreign bank that has a
[02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:30.420]  fake name, a camouflage name, the Invader Bank says they're gonna raise interest rates
[02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:36.140]  probably next year and at the same time they're gonna keep, though, you think giving themselves-
[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:40.780]  Well they say they might raise, they might not raise, they might taper, they might taper,
[02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:46.100]  that's just all trading gimmickry for trade on information. While they're screwing around,
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:50.660]  the bond market all by itself, completely out of control, will collapse and interest
[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:56.140]  rates will go from 2 to 5 to 6%. That will just be a collapse, just like people who might
[02:36:56.140 --> 02:37:01.460]  be on the edge of a fault line will play a game as to whether or not the earthquake will
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:05.580]  hit and they'll try to profit from it. But once the earthquake hits, there's nobody around
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:09.380]  the earthquake that's gonna be able to control it, it's just out of control. And once these
[02:37:09.380 --> 02:37:15.480]  interest rates hit that critical mass, people's banks, we're gonna see one of these major
[02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.180]  banks are gonna come out and say we're bankrupt because interest rates- We already saw this
[02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:23.340]  happening in Japan, Japan is already on the critical list. We're seeing banks now reporting
[02:37:23.340 --> 02:37:27.500]  stress because interest rates are creeping higher, their balance sheets are imploding.
[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.380]  They all come out and they'll print more money, maybe they can stave it off for another month
[02:37:30.380 --> 02:37:39.220]  or two. And that parallels with decadence and corruption, I mean anytime societies get
[02:37:39.220 --> 02:37:45.800]  degenerate and lose touch with reality, things implode. And unfortunately, Max, we're gonna
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:48.960]  have some interesting times ahead. Thanks for spending so much time with us, let's get
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:51.740]  that one final call from Paul in New Jersey.
[02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:53.940]  Paul, ask your question of Max Keiser.
[02:37:53.940 --> 02:37:59.380]  Yeah, I wanted to ask him who controls the world and all. Well, I more or less know who
[02:37:59.380 --> 02:38:00.380]  does.
[02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:03.660]  Well, since you know Paul, tell us.
[02:38:03.660 --> 02:38:08.280]  Well, it's the big banks and the esoteric societies, they've been doing it for years.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:13.300]  We haven't had a constitutional government since the Civil War. When we run into martial
[02:38:13.300 --> 02:38:17.740]  law and then came the Federal Reserve and the Communist Manifesto and they locked it
[02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:24.020]  in in 1933 and set up the US Corporation in 1935 after the bankruptcy and set aside our
[02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:25.020]  Constitution.
[02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:30.580]  You're right, it's esoteric societies, basically think tanks that study how to manipulate humanity
[02:38:30.580 --> 02:38:36.260]  and create new scams, who then lobby to dumb the public down so that we can never rival
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:40.420]  them and actually try to be free. Max Keiser, do you agree with that statement?
[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:45.260]  Well, I would just add that now you have the addition of computer programs that do all
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:49.180]  the heavy lifting and go out there and do a lot of dirty work for them.
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:54.540]  Yeah, thank you, Paul. Max, that's a final question there. From what I've been told by
[02:38:54.540 --> 02:39:00.940]  people with the NSA, who over the years, literally I don't go to them, they come to me and just
[02:39:00.940 --> 02:39:05.980]  pop up, but their info has turned out to be very accurate.
[02:39:05.980 --> 02:39:11.820]  And when I say NSA, contractor groups associated with it, the holy grail for 20 years has been
[02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:16.580]  to get enough data to be able to predict mass movement in the future and they now got that.
[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:21.180]  And with that, they could actually manipulate the future. And so we have these control freaks
[02:39:21.180 --> 02:39:29.020]  manipulating our future. It's a worst case scenario. I mean, from your inside info, is
[02:39:29.020 --> 02:39:31.820]  that basically what the NSA is about?
[02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:37.060]  People say, Janet talking about terrorism. From all we know, it's not about that. It's
[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:41.860]  about rigging the world economy and rigging the human culture.
[02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:48.420]  Right. The human psyche is a lot more predictable than people want to admit. And if you give
[02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:54.460]  the government the power to play on that obvious predictable ability, predictive ability where
[02:39:54.460 --> 02:39:59.980]  human nature tends to react very consistently under certain conditions, you're giving away
[02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:07.560]  the power to be free. I mean, this is what we're talking about. But the prism is a prison.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:13.220]  The only group not in control of themselves is Jamie Dimon and Don Corazon making 50 to
[02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:17.860]  one bets. I mean, isn't that the paradox here, is that the people running things are not
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:19.860]  in control of themselves?
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:29.540]  Well, it's hard to understand the motivation. You know, Jamie Dimon has kids, his daughter
[02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:37.580]  now writes for some fancy magazine. The world that he's left her is quite appalling. And
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:39.980]  he should be ashamed of himself.
[02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:44.620]  Yeah. I mean, what about your children? I used to always hear this as a youth and go,
[02:40:44.620 --> 02:40:49.020]  kids, who cares about them? And now that I have them, that's all I think about is how
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:53.620]  do I make the world better? And people laugh at me. Oh, you're a square. You don't know
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:56.220]  how to get ahead. And they're just idiots.
[02:40:56.220 --> 02:41:00.380]  Isn't that the biggest con game in the world, is thinking that you're not, you know, that
[02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:05.500]  you're going to spoil things and not have it come back on you?
[02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:12.500]  I assess the delusionary behavior that comes with omnipotence and unlimited power and no
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:18.740]  government checks or balances. There's no law. There's no deterrent. Anyone will go
[02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:25.940]  psychotic if you give them unlimited access to cash and no law and no deterrent. Just
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:31.980]  let anyone would start acting out in a bizarre, heinous, omnipotent, God-like way.
[02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:37.180]  I wouldn't. I wouldn't. I'm not like that people would, you know, if you give the average
[02:41:37.180 --> 02:41:42.460]  person a billion dollars and say, you can do anything you want, there's no laws. And
[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:46.700]  if you, and anytime you lose any of it, we'll just give you more than most people would
[02:41:46.700 --> 02:41:50.660]  go crazy. And they'll just start acting very godlike.
[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:55.860]  That's what history shows. Exactly. I absolutely. Wow. Max Kaiser, thank you so much. I look
[02:41:55.860 --> 02:42:00.820]  forward to you being back with us and thanks for writing an exclusive article for mfallwars.com.
[02:42:00.820 --> 02:42:04.340]  Okay, great Alex. Glad you enjoyed it. Speak to us soon.
[02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:07.820]  Yeah, tell us, tell Stacey Herbert, thanks for letting us have you longer.
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:11.780]  Will do. There he goes. Yeah, she's in the background.
[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:16.540]  She had dinner ready for him 30 minutes ago. I heard him in the background. Honey, come
[02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:25.220]  on. It's hot. The dinner table set. That is quite a couple right there. Nice folks. I
[02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:29.420]  tell you what they look a lot alike in person meeting them. It's really strange. They even
[02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:30.420]  say the same thing.
[02:42:30.420 --> 02:42:36.220]  They have the same little pug noses and they look the same. It's just very, very interesting.
[02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:43.780]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen. Wow. No exaggeration. I've got like 50 articles. I've got at least
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:51.260]  mentioned. Briefly, I want to just add a couple things here for everybody out there. And it's
[02:42:51.260 --> 02:43:00.100]  basically this. We are a listener supported broadcast. And everything I do here on air,
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:02.940]  things I promote or things I believe in.
[02:43:02.940 --> 02:43:15.800]  That's A. B, these tools will help wake up your friends and family and others. And by
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:22.260]  voting with your dollars, we're going to really be able to change the world. So I promote
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:26.640]  things I have looked into. I've studied that I really think are excellent. And we also
[02:43:26.640 --> 02:43:29.320]  offer very, very low prices and good deals.
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:34.400]  And so it's important to shop with the good guys. This is a free will universe if we have
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:39.260]  our way. And it's up to you to support us, spread the word about the broadcast, you name
[02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:44.380]  it. The entire system is attacking us and demonizing us every day because they know
[02:43:44.380 --> 02:43:49.180]  we're growing and they know that we understand their game plan. And so that's why it's important
[02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:54.260]  now more than ever to support in fall wars dot com to get a nightly news membership of
[02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:55.760]  prison planet dot TV membership.
[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.860]  We make it so easy. Takes about a minute to sign up. You get 11 memberships on the same
[02:43:59.860 --> 02:44:04.020]  username and passcode. She created a unique username, passcode that you can share. Give
[02:44:04.020 --> 02:44:09.080]  it to 11 friends or family or even more. And 11 people can be logged in simultaneously
[02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:13.960]  with the same username and passcode prison planet dot TV or in fall wars news dot com.
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:18.580]  If you already have a membership and haven't been sharing it, give it to friends and family,
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:21.940]  say here's your free news site subscription.
[02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:26.940]  This is really powerful info. Wake people up. That's how we're gonna win this fight.
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:30.540]  And it's happening. The president has the lowest approval rating ever. The Congress
[02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:34.860]  has the lowest approval rating ever. The mainstream media has the lowest approval rating ever.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:42.100]  They figured out that you and I and millions of people in the US, it's billions worldwide,
[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:48.580]  are discrediting them, are stabbing them, and I want to go on stabbing them.
[02:44:48.580 --> 02:44:53.660]  And I'm not trying to be in on the air to become an aristocrat. You know, they say every
[02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:58.540]  revolutionary is a closet aristocrat. Many philosophers have said that. I think that's
[02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:04.320]  bull. I really want to build a better world. I really want to go to space. I really want
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:09.740]  to empower the individual and empower our greatest people to flourish.
[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:14.740]  It is the ultimate sin, in my view, of the establishment trying to dumb people down to
[02:45:14.740 --> 02:45:20.740]  control them and poison them culturally, but also chemically and biologically to manage
[02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:27.380]  them. I mean, it is really a cold blooded move. And then I look at the globalists themselves,
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:31.940]  a bunch of hunchback, crazy looking old men, you know, who just drip evil.
[02:45:31.940 --> 02:45:40.140]  I mean, more BBC people indicted and arrested. Another one. I mean, I see this all the time.
[02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:48.940]  BBC ex broadcaster sent it for sex assaults of nine year old girls. 14 counts pled guilty.
[02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:55.860]  Folks, David Icke said that this guy was a child molester many years ago, and I did stuff
[02:45:55.860 --> 02:46:01.080]  like delay him out on air and stuff. David Icke, by the way, worked there and he says
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:05.100]  it's basically all pedophiles at the top.
[02:46:05.100 --> 02:46:08.500]  And prime minister slitting kids throats and all this stuff. And you hear this stuff a
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:13.340]  decade ago and you're like, man, I'm not going to have David Icke back on. And then it turns
[02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:18.300]  out it's true. I mean, no wonder he was around this and heard about it. I mean, you can't
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:20.420]  blame him thinking they're blood drinking lizards.
[02:46:20.420 --> 02:46:25.180]  Maybe that's easier to believe. I mean, you know, I mean, they might as well be a blood
[02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:28.980]  drinking lizard or not. He's not saying they're blood drinking lizards. The point is, I don't
[02:46:28.980 --> 02:46:38.380]  even know. This is just one article. I mean, who are these people? Anyway, side issue.
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:42.500]  There's a new film I'm in, I consulted on and I like it so much. I am the exclusive
[02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:48.740]  distributor of this film. For the first 90 days of its release, we've got it on Blu-ray
[02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.880]  and DVD.
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:56.220]  And you can get it on Blu-ray or DVD, state of mind, the history of mind control, the
[02:46:56.220 --> 02:47:00.900]  present and the future to really get people to understand the admissions of this so they
[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:05.700]  understand there's a warrant for their mind. And I'm doing this, we might want to add up
[02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:14.860]  there at the top of the special that every order of state of mind gets a free citizen
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:17.540]  rule book and info wars bumper sticker.
[02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:26.340]  But more importantly, you get a American Dream film absolutely free. And I see it hidden
[02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:31.460]  there in the fine print. We might want to add there on the site and in the banners that
[02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:37.360]  you get a new film and then you get the 35 minute or so animated documentary that's so
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:41.620]  entertaining and really made for the general public to wake them up to the Federal Reserve
[02:47:41.620 --> 02:47:45.060]  really being a Rothschild Rockefeller offshore crime syndicate.
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:50.700]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage everybody go to info war store.com
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:56.180]  and get state of mind, the psychology of control. And with it, you get the American Dream free
[02:47:56.180 --> 02:48:00.220]  wall supplies last. And it's not like you order and then don't get it. The computer
[02:48:00.220 --> 02:48:04.720]  knows how many of these we have and soon as it's sold out, it'll disappear off the screen
[02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:05.720]  that it's available.
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:11.820]  But we've got less than 5000 of these and it will go quick. This is a new major release.
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:17.580]  And it's voiced over by the lady that plays the replicant domain in Blade Runner and a
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:20.680]  bunch of other stuff. It's just got a lot of amazing people in it. So state of mind,
[02:48:20.680 --> 02:48:25.740]  the psychology of control.
[02:48:25.740 --> 02:48:32.140]  Available exclusively at info war store.com or by calling toll free 888-25-33139. And

[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:04.820]  go to info wars health.com, a mirror site as well. Well, I'm running out of time and
[02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:09.860]  I said I'd go to these callers, Wesley and Eric and Charlene and Corey and others.
[02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:17.360]  And I've got all this news as well. What are we gonna do here? It really becomes overwhelming
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:25.300]  at a certain point. Where to start here? Where to start? You know what I'm gonna do? Take
[02:49:25.300 --> 02:49:28.580]  a call now, I'm gonna go to break, come back, cover the news and then go into overdrive
[02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:29.580]  with calls.
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.100]  But I've got to get to this news, I promise to, and there's so much of it. And then it
[02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:37.580]  almost becomes a kaleidoscope of info. Wesley in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Go ahead,
[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:38.580]  thank you for holding.
[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:39.580]  Hey, Alex.
[02:49:39.580 --> 02:49:40.580]  Hey, buddy.
[02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:47.500]  I'm with James Lane actually, I do his hair and I'm telling everyone else they do need
[02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:53.980]  to buy state of mind, history of mind control off of info wars. I'm also a personal air
[02:49:53.980 --> 02:49:57.060]  subscriber, enough of that, I know you get that too much.
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:50:04.620]  What I called for was something I heard you mention is onion routing or it's called a
[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:11.220]  Tor. And it's a type of software you can download that will encrypt all of your data. It directs
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:18.420]  your internet traffic through a volunteer network and it keeps you from surveilling
[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:24.420]  or analyzing what you're seeing online. It makes everything more difficult to trace because
[02:50:24.420 --> 02:50:28.580]  everyone else running a Tor client is bouncing what you're searching online.
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:34.060]  Sure, sure. We've talked about that some. You know, my whole issue is even above trying
[02:50:34.060 --> 02:50:38.500]  to avoid all the surveillance that's illegal, by the way. How about we take our government
[02:50:38.500 --> 02:50:43.100]  back and stop this? I mean, they say they're doing it for terrorists. They run the terrorist.
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:50.140]  The elephant is in the room. They're mainly using this to spy on the economy to have unfair
[02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:54.980]  trade advantage. I appreciate your call. Maybe, maybe you can do my hair. Maybe you can shave
[02:50:54.980 --> 02:51:01.380]  my head. That's how I get my hair done. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[02:51:58.900 --> 02:52:04.740]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book cancer step outside the
[02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:11.020]  box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:15.180]  requested that carnivore be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[02:54:03.100 --> 02:54:17.340]  Alright, let's run through a bunch of the news here. Edward Snowden says Google, Facebook
[02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:23.460]  misleading their users about how much of their data goes to the NSA. No kidding, I've interviewed
[02:54:23.460 --> 02:54:29.620]  the telecom whistleblowers, it's in the Telecommunications Act. Everything is run through and stored.
[02:54:29.620 --> 02:54:33.900]  They're just incrementally introducing you to this. Here's another article, Obamacare
[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:41.500]  will share personal health info with federal state agencies. You see, that's always been
[02:54:41.500 --> 02:54:48.460]  the plan. So those articles are out of, both these articles are out of the Washington Examiner.
[02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:53.740]  And maybe we can have a document cam shot on that and I'll show the TV viewers right
[02:54:53.740 --> 02:54:54.740]  down here.
[02:54:54.740 --> 02:55:01.580]  So again, Obamacare will share personal health info with federal and state agencies, of course
[02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:07.220]  they do. Reports, school districts scan children's eyes for bus program without permission. Of
[02:55:07.220 --> 02:55:12.760]  course they do, it's all about the state taking over your kids. It's like Obama having a gay
[02:55:12.760 --> 02:55:17.700]  and lesbian event and having young children introduce it. It's inappropriate, whether
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:22.440]  it was a thing about heterosexual thing, it's just always shoving sex in everybody's face
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:25.040]  and train everybody your kids are ours.
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.760]  Flashback, Obama launches total takeover of media system. I cover that because now it's
[02:55:29.760 --> 02:55:33.860]  being announced that your cell phones will have a text and coming up video break-ins
[02:55:33.860 --> 02:55:40.940]  even when it's off, the government will force its way in. State photo ID databases becomes
[02:55:40.940 --> 02:55:47.780]  troves for police for the face scanning camera databases. You see how that works? Told you
[02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:50.400]  years ago that's what it was for, it was in the executive order.
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:56.980]  That's in my first film made in 1997. And now it's being used in that same executive
[02:55:56.980 --> 02:56:01.180]  order. It says they're gonna take blood at checkpoints without warrants, but they're
[02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:07.820]  priming the pump right now with checkpoints and the cops going, mind you I have some blood.
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:12.720]  Whatever person goes, the cops said stab your child, the mother go, ha, ha, ha, just whatever
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:15.180]  they're told, just worshiping government.
[02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:22.620]  It's all Stockholm syndrome. Athens man spends ten hours in cell refusing to give DNA. They're
[02:56:22.620 --> 02:56:26.420]  just taking DNA for everybody, even if you're arrested for bubble gum, throwing bubble gum
[02:56:26.420 --> 02:56:33.820]  on the sidewalk. That's just some of the news on that front. But just keep pushing crooks
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:39.020]  cuz your approval ratings are dropping, everybody hates you. Everybody knows who you are, okay?
[02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:42.620]  Keep calling me a kook and a liar and a nut ball. Everybody knows you're liars, that just
[02:56:42.620 --> 02:56:44.580]  sends everybody here.
[02:56:44.580 --> 02:56:52.980]  Supreme Court rules Arizona cannot require voters to prove US citizenship, incredible.
[02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:57.420]  Don't have to even show an ID, ladies and gentlemen, because again, they're gonna bring
[02:56:57.420 --> 02:57:03.300]  in groups of people that are clients of the government to vote to take our guns. So there
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:07.220]  you go, there's that very important information.
[02:57:07.220 --> 02:57:12.100]  That's just some of the news we have on that front. Continuing here, Google's launching
[02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:19.240]  Internet balloons, they're really NSA balloons. That's their cover for that. Putin says West
[02:57:19.240 --> 02:57:23.460]  arming Syrian rebels who eat human flesh, that's Reuters. And they go on in the article
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:25.100]  and admit, well, they do eat human flesh.
[02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:31.080]  We of course broke those articles about a month ago. France's News24 reports Saudi Arabia
[02:57:31.080 --> 02:57:37.540]  wants missiles for Syrian rebels. And I predicted this would happen about three months ago.
[02:57:37.540 --> 02:57:43.140]  I said they'll have the Saudis come out, cuz they always use them as a surrogate and say,
[02:57:43.140 --> 02:57:49.100]  we need to transfer missiles to them to shoot down aircraft so that there's not a discussion
[02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:51.800]  of where they really got them.
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:57.100]  And that is from NATO out of Libya, which we know they did. That way when Al Qaeda shoots
[02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:01.700]  down US airliners, they'll say Saudi Arabia gave it to them, and then we'll invade some
[02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:08.060]  other country. Saudi Arabia gave the missiles? Well, we'll invade Russia then. Like, Saudi
[02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:11.980]  Arabia, the hijackers came from there? Well, we'll invade their enemy Iraq. How's that?
[02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:16.300]  That's right, blow them Arabs up.
[02:58:16.300 --> 02:58:23.940]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, that's just some of the news. And then I've got the
[02:58:23.940 --> 02:58:29.340]  shutdown of US producing an abysmally low number of primary care doctors. The plan is
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:34.380]  bankrupt healthcare, then fully nationalize it. So their goal of bankrupting America is
[02:58:34.380 --> 02:58:42.780]  going right on schedule, the Detroitization of the Republic. Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock
[02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:46.260]  Central tonight, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:51.260]  Visit gcnlive.com today.
[02:58:51.260 --> 02:58:56.740]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:58:56.740 --> 02:59:02.020]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:59:02.020 --> 02:59:06.300]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:11.500]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:16.100]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:59:16.100 --> 02:59:21.220]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply.

[03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:20.100]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin,
[03:00:20.100 --> 03:00:27.660]  Texas, Alex Jones. The nanny state could care less about composting. You can bet when he's
[03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:35.420]  staying in $5,000 a night hotels like Michelle Obama stays in $3,000 ones, they're not composting.
[03:00:35.420 --> 03:00:40.100]  Nanny Mike strikes again, plans to force citizens to compost. That's an excuse to dig through
[03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:44.500]  your trash and find you. They've already done it in Europe. That's up on infowars.com right
[03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:53.460]  now. Speaking of bankrupting America, $3,300 per room a night for Obama and his entourage.
[03:00:53.460 --> 03:00:59.900]  That's per room. And Obama assassination bid fears aircraft carriers on standby off Irish
[03:00:59.900 --> 03:01:05.140]  Coast during G8 Summit. Aircraft carriers to make it look like this puppet actually
[03:01:05.140 --> 03:01:10.580]  runs something. These presidents are puppets, ladies and gentlemen. Speaking of this, and
[03:01:10.580 --> 03:01:14.500]  I'll get a few calls in. The Gateway Punnet reported on this yesterday, so we talked about
[03:01:14.500 --> 03:01:19.460]  it. AT&T to load iPhones with emergency alerts from Obama that you can't switch off. And
[03:01:19.460 --> 03:01:25.740]  I told you this years ago. And here's one of our cruise phones. T-Mobile, Verizon, you
[03:01:25.740 --> 03:01:26.740]  name it.
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:32.400]  It's not just the NSA that's spying on you. The government now will send you messages
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:39.580]  even when your phone's off. It will turn on because the Fuhrer, Kim Jong-un, I mean, Obama
[03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:43.860]  is telling you. And again, they prime it with stuff like, amber alert, little girls missing.
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:51.740]  Or flash flood warning this area until 1030 PM. What would you do? Nanny state, messages
[03:01:51.740 --> 03:01:56.580]  to you, everyone. This is so they can flash up people who they wanna pick up in the future
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:57.580]  and stuff.
[03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:02.300]  Imagine what Hitler would have done with this system. Let's jam in some calls. Thanks for
[03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:09.380]  holding Charlene. I call this my rifle Charlene. That's from Full Metal Jacket. In Pennsylvania,
[03:02:09.380 --> 03:02:10.380]  you're on the air.
[03:02:10.380 --> 03:02:18.300]  I just wanted to report that Bachman, Gorman, and Steve King are having a rally, which they
[03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:24.540]  can't call a rally, for open discussion on the stand up against amnesty. It's now called
[03:02:24.540 --> 03:02:26.300]  a press news conference.
[03:02:26.300 --> 03:02:27.300]  Good.
[03:02:27.300 --> 03:02:31.300]  It's in capital steps on Wednesday.
[03:02:31.300 --> 03:02:35.940]  Well, everybody should be there. This is to bankrupt the country and to drive down wages
[03:02:35.940 --> 03:02:40.060]  and it will not help the third world countries. And the globalists are rubbing their hands
[03:02:40.060 --> 03:02:44.140]  together saying they're gonna let the illegals vote and take our guns. And then they plan
[03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:46.340]  to have a civil war, which is all planned as well.
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:53.260]  I mean, again, if most of the illegals weren't programmed for socialism and programmed to
[03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:59.460]  dislike the good parts of this country, the globalists wouldn't be letting them in. They
[03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:08.100]  want this because it is the coup de grace against this republic, Charlene.
[03:03:08.100 --> 03:03:12.460]  I agree and they're asking for anybody that's in the area to come there. It might last all
[03:03:12.460 --> 03:03:16.060]  day cuz this is gonna be the longest news conference they ever had.
[03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:21.100]  Yeah, maybe we should send one of our reporters there who's on the East Coast because this
[03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:24.660]  is the type of stuff we need to be covering. And I should have gotten into the amnesty
[03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:29.620]  thing more today. It's just like the herbicide in the water, get everybody breast cancer
[03:03:29.620 --> 03:03:31.620]  and everything else.
[03:03:31.620 --> 03:03:35.860]  Look, it's craziness. The globalists just love to kill people and control things and
[03:03:35.860 --> 03:03:39.660]  they make excuses why they're doing it. Thank you, Charlene. Corey, you're on the air, go
[03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:40.660]  ahead.
[03:03:40.660 --> 03:03:47.460]  Hello, Alex. I've got a plan to exponentially increase your listenership. I went to Start
[03:03:47.460 --> 03:03:54.140]  Page, I got a printout of the Alex Jones radio station PDF file. I found out locally here
[03:03:54.140 --> 03:04:01.260]  it's KIDO out of Boise. Anyway, I made a two by three sign that says out of the loop, find
[03:04:01.260 --> 03:04:06.820]  out now, tune in to 580 KIDO. At the same time you're on in the local area, 5 to 8 p.m.
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:12.020]  here locally, you stand at your busiest intersection, you get to change the sign every day or two
[03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:17.700]  to say honk if you're listening to Alex Jones on 580 KIDO or whatever. People have nothing
[03:04:17.700 --> 03:04:22.300]  better to do while they're driving. Do your own work to check out your program.
[03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:28.500]  Exactly. RM and FM's are such treasures and everybody out there needs to tell friends
[03:04:28.500 --> 03:04:32.220]  and family every day when the show's on. If I'm on a station, you better believe they're
[03:04:32.220 --> 03:04:36.180]  going to have other good shows on as well. And if people would just go out and tell people
[03:04:36.180 --> 03:04:40.100]  to tune in with a sandwich board, it would change the world. God bless you, Corey. Thanks
[03:04:40.100 --> 03:04:45.060]  for holding. I'm sorry to Tom and Marcus and Victor. If you call me back tomorrow, I'll
[03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:49.220]  get to you. I apologize. I've got to go. I've got too much to do. The nightly news coming
[03:04:49.220 --> 03:04:54.060]  up tonight, a bunch of other stuff happening. More breaking news continually at mfallwars.com
[03:04:54.060 --> 03:05:21.060]  and prisonplanet.tv. Great job to the crew and great job to the listeners out there.
