[00:00.000 --> 00:22.120]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.080]  Listers and viewers know that I don't give you positive information just to butter you
[00:26.080 --> 00:27.080]  up and make you feel good.
[00:27.080 --> 00:28.560]  We're not dogged to feel good here.
[00:28.560 --> 00:32.320]  Told you the Q thing wasn't real, told you Biden wasn't going to be removed on January
[00:32.320 --> 00:38.360]  21st inauguration, told you basically everything that's come true.
[00:38.360 --> 00:43.160]  But when things are positive, I'm going to tell you about it.
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.640]  And the whole New World Order agenda is in deep trouble.
[00:45.640 --> 00:50.000]  We have panicked videos from the first day, official day yesterday.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.880]  Now we're tracking the second day that we're going to be playing Clips Up with Paul Joseph
[00:53.880 --> 00:56.320]  Watson coming up in the next segment.
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.760]  These are just insane clips.
[00:59.760 --> 01:04.520]  John Kerry says, what we're doing to the planet is extraterrestrial, like we're extraterrestrials.
[01:04.520 --> 01:07.440]  I told you, they believe they're becoming a new species.
[01:07.440 --> 01:11.040]  This is a real transhumanist cult and they are making aliens here.
[01:11.040 --> 01:15.040]  They're making new synthetic life forms, they're crossing species together.
[01:15.040 --> 01:20.880]  They're creating new particles with the Hadron superconducting supercollider using human
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.880]  minds.
[01:21.880 --> 01:25.200]  I wait to hear what Klaus Schwab had to say, it's all coming up next segment.
[01:25.200 --> 01:29.320]  But the crew has done a great job, the best job ever lining up today's broadcast that
[01:29.320 --> 01:34.200]  runs from 8 a.m. this morning with Harrison Smith to a little bit past midnight tonight
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.040]  and the site to share so we can get around the sensors and get everybody in and millions
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.960]  and millions of more folks waking up what's really happening in the information war is
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.480]  conspiracyfact.info.
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.320]  Klaus Schwab in their new annual report says the number one threat is anti-globalist disinformation,
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.400]  meaning Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Tucker Carlson, people like that.
[01:55.400 --> 02:00.440]  So coming up today, Paul Joseph Watson joins us in about four minutes, then we are going
[02:00.440 --> 02:01.880]  to have Mark Passio on.
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.240]  Hotep Jesus, Drew Hernandez, Gavin McGinnis, Dr. Judy Mikovits, Maria Z, Roger Stone, Savannah
[02:09.240 --> 02:16.640]  Hernandez, Darren Beatty, by the way Savannah's at DeBose, Matt Baker, Dan Dix, Tom Rins,
[02:16.640 --> 02:22.640]  Jay Dyer with a big spars update, new developments, Edward Dowd, Mickey Willis in studio, Alex
[02:22.640 --> 02:28.480]  Stein, Dr. Stella Immanuel, Robert Barnes, and a lot more, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28.480 --> 02:34.760]  So this is going to be one hell of a transmission lined up for you today and I'm asking all
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.000]  the listeners of the info war to share in your email, your text message, however you
[02:39.000 --> 02:44.000]  can word of mouth, infowars.com, forward slash show on Twitter, on Instagram, on Facebook,
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.160]  on Google, on Apple platforms, share conspiracyfact.info, one word, conspiracyfact.info, that takes
[02:52.160 --> 02:58.040]  you to a simple page that has the emergency broadcast and links to critical information
[02:58.040 --> 03:00.680]  and back to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:00.680 --> 03:04.000]  We have been the brunt of the assault, the brunt of the censorship, the brunt of the
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.640]  intelligence agencies, the brunt of the new order assault because we had their battle
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.360]  plan and the blueprints to their Death Star program and we've helped build and launched
[03:14.360 --> 03:21.000]  so many other great careers and organizations and people so this has also been a hatchery
[03:21.000 --> 03:23.080]  of the future generations in the fight.
[03:23.080 --> 03:28.440]  I've been in this 28 years, 30 plus years fighting the globalist, 28 years on air and
[03:28.440 --> 03:32.200]  I'm blessed to be here only because of God's providence and God working through you to
[03:32.200 --> 03:33.320]  support the broadcast.
[03:33.320 --> 03:41.200]  So today is a fundraiser day, we're behind over $200,000 a month and we had built my

[05:00.760 --> 05:07.600]  In early 2022, Info Wars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air. Your support
[05:07.600 --> 05:13.080]  of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalist and having
[05:13.080 --> 05:18.000]  incredibly successful results, so I thank you for your passing support. Now that was
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  a three-coin series, the founding member coin. The final coin that we're putting out
[05:23.000 --> 05:30.880]  for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin, exclusively available at
[05:30.880 --> 05:38.720]  1776coin.com. There are only a few thousand of the coins left and yes, there's a markup
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.640]  on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser and the coin is a collector's item momento
[05:43.640 --> 05:47.980]  of your support during the Second American Revolution. So if you want to get one of these
[05:47.980 --> 05:55.840]  coins, they're going fast and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at
[05:55.840 --> 06:24.620]  1776coin.com. Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[06:24.620 --> 06:32.060]  It's Tuesday, January 17, 2023 and you are tuned into the number one broadcast in the
[06:32.060 --> 06:38.500]  world credited by the enemies of humanity of being their number one enemy for rallying
[06:38.500 --> 06:43.100]  humanity against their criminal operations. They thought they'd walk in here and depopulate
[06:43.100 --> 06:46.500]  us and cut off our energy. They thought they'd sell pedophilia to our children. They thought
[06:46.500 --> 06:50.900]  they'd dump fentanyl on our streets and that we wouldn't go down without a fight. They
[06:50.900 --> 06:56.260]  were wrong and they're now in full insane panic mode admitting that their whole agenda
[06:56.260 --> 07:00.820]  is falling apart. Scientists doctors by the thousands every few days coming out. Deaths
[07:00.820 --> 07:05.820]  suddenly actuary numbers showing they hit us with a bio weapon. They thought they'd get
[07:05.820 --> 07:09.100]  away with it. Ladies and gentlemen, these are psychotics. You ask why would they do something
[07:09.100 --> 07:13.220]  like this? It's what psychotics do. Why did Stalin do it? Why did Hitler do it? Why did
[07:13.220 --> 07:19.420]  Mao Zedong do it? Because they want total control. Well, I've known Paul Joseph Watson
[07:19.420 --> 07:24.620]  since right after 9 11. And he of course runs summit dot news and does a great job and he's
[07:24.620 --> 07:29.820]  a contributor to info wars. And we've got a raft of special guests today. A huge list.
[07:29.820 --> 07:33.340]  I'm not going to go over them all. But this is going to be one hell of a broadcast right
[07:33.340 --> 07:36.740]  through midnight tonight. All of you can take the links and share them. The link they're
[07:36.740 --> 07:44.100]  not blocking is conspiracy fact dot info. So be part of this event. Helping weaponize
[07:44.100 --> 07:48.700]  the population with truth and justice and freedom against these tyrants. They fear human
[07:48.700 --> 07:53.340]  intelligence. They're battling all of us with AI, trying to block you sharing the links.
[07:53.340 --> 07:58.500]  But we can overcome them together. We will adapt and overcome. Paul Joseph Watson joins
[07:58.500 --> 08:03.340]  us. I got a lot of questions, a lot of things to cover these new most insane Clashwab clips
[08:03.340 --> 08:08.060]  ever most insane John Kerry clips ever. They're saying they're going to take over our genes
[08:08.060 --> 08:12.980]  that they're like extraterrestrials. I told you, they see themselves as aliens. They're
[08:12.980 --> 08:17.220]  making a new species. You understand that's their mindset. I read their writings. They're
[08:17.220 --> 08:21.060]  taking our bodies over. I mean, it's like body snatchers having a press conference or
[08:21.060 --> 08:25.700]  something. It's like a science fiction movie for real. We're going to cover it all. All
[08:25.700 --> 08:30.500]  these deaths, dying suddenly, all the coming out that the government knew it caused blood
[08:30.500 --> 08:37.140]  clots and death. Paul Joseph Watson, we've been friends and known each other since what
[08:37.140 --> 08:43.500]  2001, 2002. And over 20 years now, you want to just reflect for a few minutes on what
[08:43.500 --> 08:47.460]  the journey's been like and how the world's changed. How really what we predicted really
[08:47.460 --> 08:50.980]  was the reality and then hit some of the breaking news.
[08:50.980 --> 08:57.860]  Well, it's not the world that we grew up in, to say the least. The first memory I have
[08:57.860 --> 09:02.980]  of you, Alex, which I've probably explained this before was, I got to know you and your
[09:02.980 --> 09:07.420]  work because of the regime, the system, the establishment attacking you. And it was I
[09:07.420 --> 09:12.900]  think it was the year 2000. This is how old we are now. It's that far back or it was like
[09:12.900 --> 09:18.300]  early 2001. And it was a program called the secret rulers of the world hosted by John
[09:18.300 --> 09:24.380]  Ronson, who is now part of the regime. He was rewarded for his work. And it was them
[09:24.380 --> 09:30.540]  attacking you for basically believing in this dangerous conspiracy theory where a bunch
[09:30.540 --> 09:35.780]  of people got together in a redwoods forest in California and had these rituals and these
[09:35.780 --> 09:40.500]  elitist confab get togethers. Of course, you were proven completely right, as is the
[09:40.500 --> 09:46.420]  title of this broadcast. But the mere fact of them attacking you posed a question in
[09:46.420 --> 09:50.340]  my mind. Well, a lot of what he's saying kind of makes sense. So I'm going to go and check
[09:50.340 --> 09:55.140]  it out. One thing led to another. Next thing you know, I'm listening to an eight bit win
[09:55.140 --> 10:02.220]  amp radio stream off of info wars.com on a dial up modem in the year 2001. But again,
[10:02.220 --> 10:08.660]  the very source of it was the matrix, the regime attacking you trying to discredit you.
[10:08.660 --> 10:13.020]  And that's what got me interested. So even in the very process, we have to remember of
[10:13.020 --> 10:18.260]  them attacking you. And boy, are they attacking you now. It's come a long way from a channel
[10:18.260 --> 10:25.140]  for documentary. Even in that process, they bring new people to the table inadvertently.
[10:25.140 --> 10:31.380]  And this is where we're at now all these years later. And you've talked about it. As recently
[10:31.380 --> 10:36.500]  as the previous segment, Alex, I think you're right. I think we're seeing a malfunctioning
[10:36.500 --> 10:41.940]  of the matrix. I think we're beginning to see them panic. We're seeing so much information
[10:41.940 --> 10:46.900]  come to light on a myriad of issues over the past few weeks and months. But especially
[10:46.900 --> 10:51.900]  the vaccine and it's almost like Alex, it's the revelation of the method. It's almost
[10:51.900 --> 10:57.260]  like it's coming out too quickly. And they're desperately trying to stop it to prevent an
[10:57.260 --> 11:03.860]  even greater societal collapse, civil unrest, bedlam chaos, because there's so much coming
[11:03.860 --> 11:11.740]  out. I mean, I'll give you an example. The vaccine, we had a doctor appear on BBC News
[11:11.740 --> 11:19.060]  last week, Dr. Asim Mahaltra. And he is a cardiologist. They got him on there to discuss
[11:19.060 --> 11:24.980]  statins ostensibly. And then he started going into a spiel about how COVID vaccines were
[11:24.980 --> 11:31.620]  causing cardiac arrest, heart arrest, strokes, and that they should be restricted, stopped
[11:31.620 --> 11:39.060]  for the large majority of the population. That got out. It got 20 million views so far,
[11:39.060 --> 11:47.220]  Alex. The funeral of the queen broadcast on BBC One got 25 million viewers. So that clip
[11:47.220 --> 11:52.980]  of a doctor talking about the vaccine causing heart attacks is probably set to get more
[11:52.980 --> 11:58.420]  views on the BBC than the funeral. And by the way, that's just the Twitter one. I also
[11:58.420 --> 12:03.700]  saw Instagram ones with tens of millions of views as well. And then meanwhile, that British
[12:03.700 --> 12:07.940]  MP who said he talked to cardiologists and said they were covering up heart attacks,
[12:07.940 --> 12:11.900]  the government's trying to remove him from parliament right now. So they're they're in
[12:11.900 --> 12:17.620]  full panic mode, but it's not working. Yeah, they're trying to create martyrs. And they're
[12:17.620 --> 12:22.660]  trying to make examples of people as a warning to others to not get into this, to not speak
[12:22.660 --> 12:27.900]  out. And Andrew Bridgen, who you just mentioned is one of them. He's done interviews, though,
[12:27.900 --> 12:33.820]  saying, I am willing to sacrifice my entire career now, basically his life to become an
[12:33.820 --> 12:38.820]  advocate for this issue, because we don't forget that he was one of the most ardent
[12:38.820 --> 12:43.940]  advocates of the vaccine as recently as about a year ago. He used to post pictures of himself
[12:43.940 --> 12:47.420]  on Twitter. He's doing the right thing when they had the cardiology department told them
[12:47.420 --> 12:53.180]  they're covering up mass heart attacks. He's doing the right thing. Yeah. And again, they
[12:53.180 --> 12:59.340]  the matrix cracked down on him via the anti semitism angle. He never said the Holocaust
[12:59.340 --> 13:04.780]  didn't happen. He never diminished the Holocaust. He actually, you know, readvanced the seriousness
[13:04.780 --> 13:11.220]  of the Holocaust by saying this Israeli doctor told him this that it was as serious as that.
[13:11.220 --> 13:18.820]  So now he's come under attack. Of course, you have the other Andrew, Andrew Tate, who
[13:18.820 --> 13:26.940]  has been detained, thrown in prison without charge for about two weeks now, 30 days plus.
[13:26.940 --> 13:33.460]  Like you, Alex, he's been denied a trial. He's been subjected to trial by media. And
[13:33.460 --> 13:38.620]  even some of his accusers, the media is now interviewing have come out and said, no, he's
[13:38.620 --> 13:42.780]  done nothing wrong. He treated as nothing but fantastically. And again, why are they
[13:42.780 --> 13:47.860]  doing that? Why are they coming after and creating these martyrs? By the way, his brother is
[13:47.860 --> 13:52.180]  the world chess champion. His dad was the world chess champion. He's three time world
[13:52.180 --> 13:57.300]  kickboxing champion, very, very cerebral. He would he told me that before because these
[13:57.300 --> 14:01.980]  rumors were out there years ago. Is he insane? Is he totally nuts? And then a video goes
[14:01.980 --> 14:05.980]  out of him spanking his girlfriend five years ago, because she asked him to and folks, I'm
[14:05.980 --> 14:10.580]  sorry to tell you, half the women I've known want you to slap him around. I don't do it.
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.340]  And that's when the relationship start to end. But I mean, I had women say, punch me in
[14:14.340 --> 14:17.900]  the face, slap me, tell me I'm a piece of filth. He didn't even do that. He spanks her
[14:17.900 --> 14:21.940]  on the butt. So yeah, this is obviously a sigh up as well. I mean, what a whole bunch
[14:21.940 --> 14:24.820]  of women have come out. It's not just two of the so called accusers said I never even
[14:24.820 --> 14:27.260]  said this. It's made up.
[14:27.260 --> 14:33.300]  Well, why is 50 shades of gray so popular? But again, the girl involved in that controversy
[14:33.300 --> 14:38.060]  came out and said it was completely consensual. It's part of their kink play. And that's the
[14:38.060 --> 14:44.060]  point. Do you really think Alex the matrix, the regime is mad at Andrew Tate because he's
[14:44.060 --> 14:45.060]  a vile misogynist.
[14:45.060 --> 14:49.900]  Look, I'll say what he says about I'm not proud of it, but I've been a little bit promiscuous
[14:49.900 --> 14:55.060]  in my day. Half the women I've dated want me to choke them. I mean, and I won't do it.
[14:55.060 --> 14:57.700]  I'm not into paying folks, but that's what goes on.
[14:57.700 --> 15:00.460]  Well, I mean, they've done studies.
[15:00.460 --> 15:05.420]  Just be honest, how many women want you to choke them?
[15:05.420 --> 15:10.900]  All I'm all I'm saying is that there have been studies where, you know, these are mainstream
[15:10.900 --> 15:15.220]  studies, you know, 63% of women have rape fantasies and stuff like that. Some people
[15:15.220 --> 15:20.300]  are into that. Alex, that's just their thing. That's their king. I'm happily engaged now.
[15:20.300 --> 15:24.820]  And I'm not into any of that. But this is the point. They're not angry at him because
[15:24.820 --> 15:28.540]  of that because of what he's done to women, what he says about women. They're angry at
[15:28.540 --> 15:32.300]  him because he comes on your show and talks about the military industrial complex talks
[15:32.300 --> 15:33.300]  about the vaccine.
[15:33.300 --> 15:36.740]  And he's got hundreds of millions of young boys listening wanting to be manly. That's
[15:36.740 --> 15:40.620]  his real crime. While they're teaching in UK schools about how dangerous he is and how
[15:40.620 --> 15:47.260]  being masculine is bad. Stay right there. Paul Joseph Watson. I didn't know you're engaged.
[15:47.260 --> 15:55.940]  I got to meet this lady. Wow. Watson's hanging up the spurs. Quite the lady's man himself.

[17:56.620 --> 18:00.420]  a true 360 win.
[18:00.420 --> 18:07.180]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mize, famously said more than
[18:07.180 --> 18:13.580]  150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers
[18:13.580 --> 18:19.940]  kept saying he died decades before he did die. And it's the same PSYOP today. Infowars
[18:19.940 --> 18:23.860]  is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because of
[18:23.860 --> 18:28.180]  the facts of what we've covered is coming true. But if they can convince you we've been
[18:28.180 --> 18:33.300]  shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting, you stop
[18:33.300 --> 18:38.540]  spreading the word, then they do win. Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people
[18:38.540 --> 18:42.460]  that can shut down Infowars and that's you, the viewers and listeners. If you decide we're

[19:00.380 --> 19:04.940]  I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects
[19:04.940 --> 19:09.540]  and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years. And now with all
[19:09.540 --> 19:14.500]  the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors, it
[19:14.500 --> 19:19.140]  is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[19:19.140 --> 19:23.540]  But these products work great for women as well. Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.

[20:01.900 --> 20:08.900]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:08.900 --> 20:28.900]  Well, the legendary PJW is our guest. You want to finish up at the end or take thing,
[20:28.900 --> 20:34.740]  but I want to be very clear to young men, promiscuity is not a good thing in hindsight
[20:34.740 --> 20:39.460]  and I grew out of it. And the fact that there's so much corruption in so many people and them
[20:39.460 --> 20:44.140]  promoting 50 shades of gray in public schools and girls being into that, you're going to
[20:44.140 --> 20:47.740]  end up going to jail if a girl tricks you to slap her around. A lot of times they end
[20:47.740 --> 20:52.500]  up going to the police. Don't do it. It's very dangerous and it's just something you're
[20:52.500 --> 20:56.220]  going to have to deal with. Or I suggest you just settle down with a nice girl that's
[20:56.220 --> 21:00.020]  a good Christian person, never experienced all that stuff. I mean, it's really in hindsight,
[21:00.020 --> 21:03.380]  I wish that I had never been so worldly, but I've been honest about that because I've
[21:03.380 --> 21:06.900]  repented of it. But you see Andrew takes me in a racy guy. I don't think he did anything
[21:06.900 --> 21:11.780]  illegal, but he got in that racy area and he got burned. And I think he's being railroaded
[21:11.780 --> 21:15.980]  and it's wrong, Paul, but it just shows that type of lifestyle is very dangerous, Paul.
[21:15.980 --> 21:21.340]  Well, precisely, and you'll notice that the regime didn't attack him for telling men to
[21:21.340 --> 21:25.820]  live promiscuous lifestyles, which again, a lot of people go through that phase. But
[21:25.820 --> 21:31.300]  I think ultimately it's very harmful and yes, it's very dangerous because you'll get women
[21:31.300 --> 21:36.140]  and I've seen cases of this where, you know, they break up with somebody and then they
[21:36.140 --> 21:39.460]  go and accuse them of something. It's like, well, no, you've been accused of it. You obviously
[21:39.460 --> 21:44.260]  did it. And that's what's happened with Andrew Tate trial by media. The accusation alone
[21:44.260 --> 21:49.500]  is that he's guilty. And yet they're not angry at him for the misogyny for the comments
[21:49.500 --> 21:54.180]  about women. It's because of what he says about the matrix about the regime and the
[21:54.180 --> 22:00.700]  fact that similar to your case, Alex, they banned you off every platform, but bullets,
[22:00.700 --> 22:05.020]  you know, ideas are bulletproof. So that didn't really work. So then they came after you with
[22:05.020 --> 22:07.900]  the legal stuff and that's the progress that they take.
[22:07.900 --> 22:12.220]  And one of the girls at a UFC event, they caught one of the girls that accused him
[22:12.220 --> 22:16.540]  at a UFC event coming up and hitting on him and he refuses her.
[22:16.540 --> 22:21.620]  Yeah, I think he's got very wary to it now, but that's how they got there in. That's how
[22:21.620 --> 22:26.900]  they got to him with these presumably false accusations, but we'll see. But again, doesn't
[22:26.900 --> 22:31.740]  matter because love him or hate him, Tate's ideas are like a virus and it's now infected
[22:31.740 --> 22:40.100]  the mainframe. I remember info wars doing competitions with stickers and, you know, 1984, 1776, that
[22:40.100 --> 22:44.860]  kind of rhetoric that entered into the cult underground that entered into the subconsciousness
[22:44.860 --> 22:49.380]  and Tate's ideas have done the same. They've infected the mainframe. So even if you take
[22:49.380 --> 22:55.100]  him out as a source, he's got, you know, millions of young lads who are uploading his content
[22:55.100 --> 22:58.060]  on all these different platforms on a daily basis.
[22:58.060 --> 23:02.820]  There's a new thing in the UK, Alex, where apparently, and I've been told this by several
[23:02.820 --> 23:07.540]  people now, it's happening all over the place, young lads like teenage boys are just walking
[23:07.540 --> 23:13.860]  up to complete strangers in public and telling them the matrix wasn't a movie, it was a documentary.
[23:13.860 --> 23:19.860]  Where's that come from? It's come from Andrew Tate saying it. They organized flash mobs of,
[23:19.860 --> 23:25.940]  you know, gangs of teenage boys in the streets chanting for his release. His ideas have infected
[23:25.940 --> 23:30.460]  the mainframe, whether you like it or not. And that's why they're so panicked about his
[23:30.460 --> 23:35.180]  influence on these allegations were where we're years old and it already been investigated
[23:35.180 --> 23:40.100]  and dropped. And so, you know, I expect people to try stuff like that on me. They've already
[23:40.100 --> 23:47.500]  tried the Daily Mail and others, I know, paid people to make up absolutely complete lies.
[23:47.500 --> 23:50.500]  And that's why they didn't file suits because they couldn't prove them unless they rigged
[23:50.500 --> 23:54.300]  the case. But it's certainly a dangerous world. What do you make of the Davos groups saying
[23:54.300 --> 23:58.780]  the number one threat is people criticizing them and they're working with the UN and governments
[23:58.780 --> 24:04.500]  in big tech to silence criticism. AP is reporting that today, the AP that it's bad to criticize
[24:04.500 --> 24:07.740]  Davos. Even though they're announcing world government, we own your bodies, we're taking
[24:07.740 --> 24:11.900]  over. We're like extraterrestrials. You're going to own nothing, have nothing. You're
[24:11.900 --> 24:15.740]  going to eat bugs. I mean, these are quotes.
[24:15.740 --> 24:22.340]  Well, the AP, I think the president of AP is at the Davos meeting, meeting with all
[24:22.340 --> 24:26.780]  these globalists while they're publicly telling you, you can't criticize them. Yeah, they're
[24:26.780 --> 24:32.260]  in a blind panic, Alex. I mean, go on any WEF tweet and look at the responses to whatever
[24:32.260 --> 24:38.860]  they post. It's 100% anti. And they're in a blind panic. They've got 5000 soldiers there
[24:38.860 --> 24:43.620]  to guard them. They've got unprecedented security measures. People are saying it's like nothing
[24:43.620 --> 24:48.820]  they've seen before. And it's because they are paranoid. A number of the, I think Clash
[24:48.820 --> 24:53.940]  Schwab is even going to be there, right? At least for the initial two days. Other top
[24:53.940 --> 24:57.780]  government leaders aren't going to be there. A lot of business people are going to be there.
[24:57.780 --> 25:01.820]  But others are skipping it for no apparent reason. So they're in a blind panic. They're
[25:01.820 --> 25:08.660]  saying there's a new poly crisis facing humanity. And it's all this different fallout from the
[25:08.660 --> 25:14.340]  resentments of lockdown, from the resentments of the cost of living crisis, from the resentments
[25:14.340 --> 25:18.020]  of this mad march towards net zero with this climate change.
[25:18.020 --> 25:22.020]  And that's the key, Paul. Clash Schwab, as you know, you've written about it extensively,
[25:22.020 --> 25:25.540]  have all bragged they're going to make a saying, recut the resources off, and that we'll then
[25:25.540 --> 25:29.740]  bring in a socialist utopia with a universal basic income. But instead, we're all blaming
[25:29.740 --> 25:33.860]  the ones that did it. So they're getting the hate instead of them directing it at each
[25:33.860 --> 25:37.620]  other. So instead of them getting it to make us kill each other, now we're knowing who
[25:37.620 --> 25:41.180]  did it because of you and Tucker Carlson and countless others. They're in deep trouble.
[25:41.180 --> 25:44.260]  What are you expecting to do now?
[25:44.260 --> 25:49.460]  I think they're trying to do a slow reveal a steam valve method, a revelation of the
[25:49.460 --> 25:53.860]  method where they allow all this information to come out, but they allow it to come out
[25:53.860 --> 25:58.260]  slowly because they fear if it comes out in a big crescendo, it's going to cause a massive
[25:58.260 --> 26:03.420]  explosion with major social unrest across the Western world. I mean, you can look just
[26:03.420 --> 26:09.920]  look at the polls, Alex, multi decade brainwashing about climate change and half the population
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.660]  of the world nearly doesn't believe in it. After all that social engineering, they did
[26:14.660 --> 26:20.900]  a poll recently, 84% of Americans believe the mainstream media is a threat to democracy.
[26:20.900 --> 26:25.500]  So again, they put people trial by media, they put people like you on that, thinking
[26:25.500 --> 26:30.220]  that they have the moral high ground, the credibility to even put anyone else on trial.
[26:30.220 --> 26:35.780]  When their trust, their credibility is in the toilet, you know, you've got polls showing
[26:35.780 --> 26:42.980]  that 89% of Americans have rejected this drag queen LGP GPT narrative. You've got polls
[26:42.980 --> 26:49.460]  showing that, you know, the COVID situation has been massively exaggerated. Now, even
[26:49.460 --> 26:53.980]  in the United Kingdom where we had a big take up of boosters, that's now dropped, I believe
[26:53.980 --> 26:59.540]  below 30, 40% because of all the information that's coming out. And it's just whether it
[26:59.540 --> 27:04.060]  causes a social explosion. I think that's what they're concerned about. And that's what
[27:04.060 --> 27:09.100]  they're going to be talking about at Davos as they hide behind the soldiers and the unprecedented
[27:09.100 --> 27:10.100]  security.
[27:10.100 --> 27:15.460]  I'm sure you've seen these clips of Schwab, we must come together, we must defeat those
[27:15.460 --> 27:19.940]  that criticize us, we must stop them talking about us. And then Kerry says our takeovers
[27:19.940 --> 27:23.980]  like an alien takeover, because that's what they are, the transhumanists, they're literally,
[27:23.980 --> 27:28.100]  it is an alien takeover, they're creating technologies alien to the planet and trying
[27:28.100 --> 27:33.100]  to force us into a totally unnatural new system.
[27:33.100 --> 27:38.200]  There's also something weird going on with that, Alex. And it's this whole UFO thing.
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.300]  Because in the 90s, anyone who talked about UFOs and treated it with legitimacy was ridiculed,
[27:43.300 --> 27:49.940]  was called a crank. And now the mainstream media, popular culture is, is all about how
[27:49.940 --> 27:50.940]  UFOs...
[27:50.940 --> 27:51.940]  Yep, go ahead.
[27:51.940 --> 27:57.860]  Oh, sorry, Paul, I didn't mean to hit the button on you. You were saying UFOs.
[27:57.860 --> 28:03.100]  Yeah. In the 90s, when you talked about UFOs, you were ridiculed, you were called a crank.
[28:03.100 --> 28:08.700]  Now the popular media, the mainstream culture is all about how UFOs are completely legitimate.
[28:08.700 --> 28:13.980]  The Pentagon has come out and expanded its investigation into them. They're saying now,
[28:13.980 --> 28:18.620]  record increase in UFO sightings over the past year, according to the U.S. National
[28:18.620 --> 28:19.620]  Intelligence Office.
[28:19.620 --> 28:25.580]  So there's something very weird going on with this mainstream forcing of this UFO issue
[28:25.580 --> 28:29.980]  down everyone's necks in an attempt to make them believe that it's all legitimate. And
[28:29.980 --> 28:32.180]  then you read about Project Bluebeam. It's very interesting.
[28:32.180 --> 28:35.220]  Paul, it's been too long. I was hitting the button to them to say put your website up
[28:35.220 --> 28:39.780]  and actually hit the button to you. And talking to you, I apologize. Summit.News, you've got
[28:39.780 --> 28:43.540]  to come back sooner. I know you'll host the show sometime, but we love you, Paul. We love
[28:43.540 --> 28:47.860]  the great work. We follow all your work at Summit.News. Thank you so much.
[28:47.860 --> 28:48.860]  Thanks, Alex.
[28:48.860 --> 28:49.860]  Good luck.
[28:49.860 --> 28:52.540]  Amazing. All right, 20 years working with that guy. We'll be right back with another
[28:52.540 --> 29:00.500]  special guest and more. Stay with us and I'll play the W.E.F. Clips. I promise.
[29:00.500 --> 29:07.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy of my number
[29:07.260 --> 29:12.940]  one best-selling book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, exclusively available
[29:12.940 --> 29:18.060]  at infowarstore.com. Yes, you can get the book in stores. You can find it online. But
[29:18.060 --> 29:22.660]  if you want to get a historic signed copy and be part of our fundraiser to stay on
[29:22.660 --> 29:28.500]  air, go to infowarstore.com and go to the book section and get your signed book. There
[29:28.500 --> 29:33.460]  are only about a thousand of these left. And when they're gone, they're gone. I'm never
[29:33.460 --> 29:38.340]  going to sign the book again. We have a little limited edition thing coming out later. There's
[29:38.340 --> 29:41.660]  a piece of art that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided when I'm going to
[29:41.660 --> 29:45.940]  do that. It may never happen. But for just simple, straight-up signed books and to be
[29:45.940 --> 29:50.340]  part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book
[29:50.340 --> 29:55.860]  at infowarstore.com. I thank you all for your support. Please go to infowarstore.com and

[30:03.780 --> 30:08.980]  so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalist.
[30:08.980 --> 30:13.300]  And I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down. But ladies and gentlemen,
[30:13.300 --> 30:19.380]  I can't do it without your support. And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000

[32:31.620 --> 32:35.060]  the children. But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first. These
[32:35.060 --> 32:38.580]  monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies. They're
[32:38.580 --> 32:42.820]  already given to the pregnant women. Miscarriages are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase
[32:42.820 --> 32:48.580]  in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots. We can and will
[32:48.580 --> 32:53.500]  save the children and they are counting on us. Let's do it together. And the fight starts
[32:53.500 --> 32:58.700]  at infowars.com and the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[32:58.700 --> 33:01.860]  Now take action now.
[33:01.860 --> 33:17.900]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.900 --> 33:31.860]  It makes those that are gullible hate you. The people that are awake love you. So it's
[33:31.860 --> 33:36.180]  a very weird paradox. The Nabo Screamers announced that we are their number one enemies, those
[33:36.180 --> 33:40.300]  that criticize them, those that are anti-New World Order. AP comes out and says we're all
[33:40.300 --> 33:43.820]  making it up. They want world government to control our bodies. While they say on the
[33:43.820 --> 33:48.780]  stage they're going to take over our genetics with these shots. Now we've got a raft of
[33:48.780 --> 33:52.740]  special guests. We're going live until midnight. It's the same info wars. Alex Jones was
[33:52.740 --> 33:57.420]  right broadcast. We are not going away. We are not shutting down. We are in chapter 11,
[33:57.420 --> 34:02.300]  sub chapter 5 reorganization. That means with the rigged trials they had, that takes them
[34:02.300 --> 34:07.900]  to the table and basically makes them understand they don't have all this extra money and ends
[34:07.900 --> 34:12.380]  this whole thing. But who will end our broadcast is the listeners and viewers if you believe
[34:12.380 --> 34:16.620]  their lies that we're being shut down. We're not being shut down. Even if the court made
[34:16.620 --> 34:20.260]  that decision, I would just go across the street and fire the show right back up and
[34:20.260 --> 34:23.460]  I've got offers all over the place. But I want to keep our crew here. I want to keep
[34:23.460 --> 34:28.300]  this brain trust here, Bandot video, all the things we're doing. So please keep us on
[34:28.300 --> 34:35.220]  air. Go to infowarstore.com. Biggest sale of the year yet is running right now. And a

[35:51.220 --> 35:55.260]  And it's key to understand. We have all these great guests that are coming on, tweeting
[35:55.260 --> 35:58.660]  and Facebooking and everything else and telling their great audience to come here to create
[35:58.660 --> 36:03.220]  synergy. And in the future, with these folks, I want to do that for them as well. And this
[36:03.220 --> 36:08.060]  is how we fight together, how we organize, how we unify and create that amplification
[36:08.060 --> 36:12.180]  effect that the elites are so scared of. Their number one issue with Davos, the Bilderberg
[36:12.180 --> 36:18.020]  group's mouth, their spokesperson, is the burgeoning independent anti-globalist pro-human
[36:18.020 --> 36:23.580]  natural law movement. And speaking of exploding, I've known who Mark Passio is for a decade
[36:23.580 --> 36:28.500]  or eight, nine years at least. I listen to him almost every day. My wife listens to him
[36:28.500 --> 36:33.480]  religiously. And his natural law understanding, that's what the ancients and the globalists
[36:33.480 --> 36:39.220]  understand, is exploding. I get so many comments in grocery stores, on the streets, everywhere
[36:39.220 --> 36:43.900]  about Mark Passio. But also here, his quotes coming out of people's mouths, and I say,
[36:43.900 --> 36:47.780]  you know who Mark Passio is, and they don't know. That's when you know you're successful.
[36:47.780 --> 36:51.540]  When you hear people saying the exact thing someone's saying that they got from him through
[36:51.540 --> 36:56.580]  somebody else, that's when you know you've broken into the zeitgeist. So congratulations
[36:56.580 --> 37:01.460]  to what in the world is really happening. Host, and there it is on screen, what on earth
[37:01.460 --> 37:06.620]  is happening.com. That is Mark Passio. We only got him for two segments, because that's
[37:06.620 --> 37:11.020]  the issue with having so many great guests on. We can only have them for two segments.
[37:11.020 --> 37:16.900]  And the list of guests is a conspiracy fact.info. So without further ado, Mark Passio, condensing,
[37:16.900 --> 37:20.380]  boiling down your most important information. Thanks for being here.
[37:20.380 --> 37:26.060]  Alex, thank you so much for having me on. I would say that in a nutshell, my information
[37:26.060 --> 37:34.780]  boils down to basically two things. The first is the causal factors for why humanity is
[37:34.780 --> 37:42.900]  currently experiencing tyranny and enslavement. The current human condition is actually covert
[37:42.900 --> 37:50.140]  slavery. And unlike other researchers and broadcasts, what I do on what on earth is
[37:50.140 --> 37:57.380]  happening is I explain the causal reasons that humanity is experiencing those conditions
[37:57.380 --> 38:03.940]  as opposed to breaking down the 3D worldly events. I'm not saying I never do that, but
[38:03.940 --> 38:09.780]  that is not the main area of my focus. What I focus upon is explaining to people, what
[38:09.780 --> 38:15.940]  are the underlying reasons that this is actually manifesting in our world and that this is
[38:15.940 --> 38:24.100]  our current condition. And if we understand that there are laws that govern human freedom
[38:24.100 --> 38:31.620]  and the laws that govern human freedom are entirely based on whether the aggregate or
[38:31.620 --> 38:40.140]  collective human behavior is overall moral or not. In other words, there's a direct relationship
[38:40.140 --> 38:47.500]  to moral behavior and whether humanity experiences freedom or tyranny and enslavement and chaos.
[38:47.500 --> 38:54.900]  So we have to understand what the objective morality is. And this constitutes the study
[38:54.900 --> 39:00.660]  of what I call in my work, natural law. Many other researchers in the past have termed
[39:00.660 --> 39:05.140]  it natural law. Natural law is the laws of the creator of the universe. It's the laws
[39:05.140 --> 39:13.140]  of God. It's the laws of morality in the entire cosmos, in the entire universe. These are
[39:13.140 --> 39:20.340]  the laws that ultimately govern the behavior of intelligent beings, beings with the capacity
[39:20.340 --> 39:25.660]  for understanding the difference between right and wrong behavior. And so we have to be correct
[39:25.660 --> 39:31.620]  about what right and wrong behavior actually is. I always say on my show constantly, the
[39:31.620 --> 39:37.620]  reason that we're losing our rights is because the average human being cannot define a right.
[39:37.620 --> 39:42.540]  They cannot tell you what a human right is and actually get the definition, get the answer
[39:42.540 --> 39:48.140]  to that question correct. A right is simply an action that does not initiate harm to another
[39:48.140 --> 39:55.020]  sentient being. If we live and exist within our rights, meaning we're not committing any
[39:55.020 --> 40:00.220]  actions that are transgressions against other sentient beings, we're not committing murder,
[40:00.220 --> 40:07.140]  assault, rape, theft, trespass, coercion, and deception. What I call in my work the true
[40:07.140 --> 40:13.900]  seven deadly sins. Then we are not violating the rights of others. And then our behaviors
[40:13.900 --> 40:19.300]  go out into the universe and they are actually interoperating with the natural law, with
[40:19.300 --> 40:25.660]  the laws of behavioral consequence embedded within nature. And then we are receiving back
[40:25.660 --> 40:32.900]  from the universe a consequence. We either receive consequence for good moral behaviors,
[40:32.900 --> 40:38.020]  in which case we will create things that are orderly, prosperous, we create a condition
[40:38.020 --> 40:43.660]  of freedom, or if our behaviors are in opposition to the natural law, then we're going to create
[40:43.660 --> 40:49.620]  a collective condition of chaos and tyranny and enslavement. And you only need to look
[40:49.620 --> 40:54.940]  at the result that we're getting to be able to gauge what path we've been on and are currently
[40:54.940 --> 41:03.060]  still on. Meaning that if we're getting tyranny, the majority of the human population, by definition,
[41:03.060 --> 41:10.740]  according to natural law, cannot possibly be engaged in true morality, in true aggregate
[41:10.740 --> 41:16.980]  moral behavior as a whole as a population. And this is because human beings in the collective,
[41:16.980 --> 41:23.260]  in the aggregate, unfortunately, still in the modern day, do not actually truly know
[41:23.260 --> 41:29.900]  the real objective difference between right and wrong. As odd as that sounds to say, that
[41:29.900 --> 41:35.700]  is actually the truth that most of human beings don't know true objective morality and aren't
[41:35.700 --> 41:43.340]  aligning their behavior to it as a matter of fact in reality and nature. They have ideas
[41:43.340 --> 41:50.500]  that have been embedded in their mind through mind control practices about what reality constitutes.
[41:50.500 --> 41:56.700]  But much of that is incorrect and they have to reevaluate that and actually relearn it.
[41:56.700 --> 42:04.340]  And when you do actually relearn true morality, when you actually do away with the false notions
[42:04.340 --> 42:10.700]  of morality that people have been taught since time immemorial in all different institutions,
[42:10.700 --> 42:18.140]  then you actually learn the science that constitutes natural law. And you could accurately and
[42:18.140 --> 42:23.620]  consistently align your behavior to it and actually teach others to do the same. That's
[42:23.620 --> 42:25.500]  the first thing that I teach.
[42:25.500 --> 42:28.900]  Absolutely. We'll put it back on screen, your URL, because it's just an introduction.
[42:28.900 --> 42:33.100]  People can go learn about it there. But when we come back, why are the globalists of these
[42:33.100 --> 42:39.260]  dark forces that know the law, why are they actively trying to go against it and then
[42:39.260 --> 42:43.980]  admitting it's going to bring down civilization? Why would they want to bring down order? What
[42:43.980 --> 42:48.620]  is their point in doing that? Mark Pascio, what on earth is happening? We'll be right
[42:48.620 --> 42:54.340]  back with him on the other side. Stay with us and share the URL, conspiracyfact.info.
[42:54.340 --> 43:00.060]  You want to break the matrix.
[43:00.060 --> 43:04.900]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order. And
[43:04.900 --> 43:12.180]  the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset. And Info Wars embodies that fight
[43:12.180 --> 43:16.780]  for human liberty against globalist tyranny. Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful
[43:16.780 --> 43:23.060]  fundraiser of silver coins. When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the
[43:23.060 --> 43:28.100]  transmission and you get a historical momento so you can remember the great contribution
[43:28.100 --> 43:32.300]  you make to freedom. Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of
[43:32.300 --> 43:37.740]  the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right
[43:37.740 --> 43:43.900]  now, while supplies last at 1776coin.com. And just like an NPR pledge drive where they
[43:43.900 --> 43:49.740]  mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because
[43:49.740 --> 43:56.140]  it's a fundraiser. But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what
[43:56.140 --> 44:25.980]  coins remain. Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[44:26.140 --> 44:40.220]  Now, the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[44:40.220 --> 44:48.380]  was death and hell followed with him. A book of Revelation. Very serious times to be alive,
[44:48.380 --> 44:51.340]  folks. They're not just doing this as a one off. This is the beginning of the rest of
[44:51.340 --> 44:55.620]  our lives. This is our fight. And I'm proud of humanity. The globalists even admit it's
[44:55.620 --> 44:59.380]  leaked. They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought
[44:59.380 --> 45:00.380]  it would.
[45:00.380 --> 45:04.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements in the history
[45:04.500 --> 45:11.100]  of Info Wars under a new brand name, Info Wars Platinum. Now, all three of these revolutionary
[45:11.100 --> 45:16.980]  products you see in front of you are already number one best sellers in the market for

[45:21.140 --> 45:27.580]  listeners, the owners of fan and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what
[45:27.580 --> 45:33.340]  these products are found for under other names. And not just under one name, they sell these
[45:33.340 --> 45:37.740]  under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put
[45:37.740 --> 45:43.460]  out. The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores. We're talking about
[45:43.460 --> 45:50.380]  Payne MD. We're talking about HGH Max Boost. We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[45:50.380 --> 45:54.460]  These things are incredible. I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first

[47:28.660 --> 47:34.500]  Tonight with a raft of the most informative, best guests we've got. And Mark Paseo is an
[47:34.500 --> 47:39.420]  expert on natural laws here laying this out. Now all the ancient civilizations that actually
[47:39.420 --> 47:44.460]  rose knew this. The Bible is all about it. But if you look at Klaus Schwab when he speaks,
[47:44.460 --> 47:49.700]  he says we're going to make an angrier world. We're going to destroy this world. And we're
[47:49.700 --> 47:53.620]  going to bring in our new one that they called and I'm going to play the clip coming up.
[47:53.620 --> 47:58.180]  John Kerry said it's like extraterrestrial. He said it's not human. It's new. So they're
[47:58.180 --> 48:02.500]  trying to overthrow the order that they're trying to go against not just Earth's order,
[48:02.500 --> 48:05.980]  but what God created his order. So I know you like talking about solutions, but people
[48:05.980 --> 48:11.700]  also want to understand why these evil people go against the law and how they get so much
[48:11.700 --> 48:16.020]  power. It always seems for a time, but then it causes great destruction. And in almost
[48:16.020 --> 48:20.540]  every case, they think it'll destroy us. I think they're in control of the cycle, but
[48:20.540 --> 48:25.700]  really it ends up destroying them. So what's your view on why they know natural law? Because
[48:25.700 --> 48:29.060]  I mean, I know you know that I listen to you and I know that from watching them, but and
[48:29.060 --> 48:32.620]  then they go against it. But then a lot of times they live by it, but then they kind
[48:32.620 --> 48:35.260]  of make us live by something else. What's happening?
[48:35.260 --> 48:41.820]  Well, this connects directly into what is the second major thing that I teach in the
[48:41.820 --> 48:50.180]  body of my work. And that is the nature of the occult world. What is occult information?
[48:50.180 --> 48:54.460]  What is occult knowledge? What is occultism in general? The word occult simply means
[48:54.460 --> 49:00.940]  hidden. It is hidden knowledge about how not only the human psyche functions and operates
[49:00.940 --> 49:06.700]  and what its deep motivations are and how it could possibly even be manipulated. But
[49:06.700 --> 49:12.580]  it is also the knowledge of how the natural law in the universe actually functions. It's
[49:12.580 --> 49:20.100]  real hidden science that is hidden from the masses of people to actually manipulate, control
[49:20.100 --> 49:25.300]  and deceive them by keeping them in a state of ignorance. If they're kept in a state
[49:25.300 --> 49:32.940]  of ignorance, then it's a piece of cake. It's child's play literally for these master manipulators
[49:32.940 --> 49:38.420]  that are actually running things to deceive and manipulate the everyday person because
[49:38.420 --> 49:43.780]  it's like, it's like, you know, beating someone for money that doesn't know how to add and
[49:43.780 --> 49:48.140]  subtract numbers because they've never learned mathematics. If they if people don't know
[49:48.140 --> 49:54.300]  how the real sciences of human psychology and behavioral law work, it's child's play
[49:54.300 --> 50:00.180]  to manipulate them. And that's my next question is, that's my next question is, you said earlier
[50:00.180 --> 50:04.220]  which is totally true, you read what you saw. So they know that when they dumb people down
[50:04.220 --> 50:08.580]  and go against natural law, that it blows back on them and their families, they're not immune
[50:08.580 --> 50:12.820]  from the horrible world they're making sure it gives them power, but it creates a hellhole.
[50:12.820 --> 50:18.960]  How do they do that then? Well, they're the dark occultists who are wielding this knowledge
[50:18.960 --> 50:25.060]  to create a power differential over people. That's why they want to keep the knowledge
[50:25.060 --> 50:30.500]  of natural law and the causal factors of the human condition hidden. They want to remain
[50:30.500 --> 50:35.700]  in power over other people because here's their overarching worldview, which ultimately
[50:35.700 --> 50:42.700]  answers your question. Their worldview is, if there are behavioral laws in effect in
[50:42.700 --> 50:48.100]  the universe that they themselves did not put there, but a higher power in the universe
[50:48.100 --> 50:56.100]  put there, their overarching worldview in their mindset is that the universe itself is a
[50:56.100 --> 51:03.300]  prison simply because it is governed by moral behavioral exactly, exactly. And we go back
[51:03.300 --> 51:07.020]  to the story of Lucifer and that's really what they're doing is they're at war with
[51:07.020 --> 51:12.780]  God in the universe and with order. That's exactly correct. They, they, their mental
[51:12.780 --> 51:19.740]  attitude and worldview is because they are in such a state of out of control ego and
[51:19.740 --> 51:29.420]  total self absorption that their mental worldview is we would rather reign over a prison cell
[51:29.420 --> 51:35.860]  than serve God and his laws, it's laws. They would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.
[51:35.860 --> 51:42.740]  That is their literal worldview. They see the universe as a behavioral prison because they
[51:42.740 --> 51:50.140]  know that behavioral consequential law is in effect and that individuals and whole societies
[51:50.140 --> 51:57.300]  cannot simply just do whatever they want without behavioral consequence. So what they
[51:57.300 --> 52:04.620]  want to ultimately do is to brainwash, deceive and manipulate people to follow their orders
[52:04.620 --> 52:12.700]  and do these immoral behaviors for them in their name and ultimately the, the brunt,
[52:12.700 --> 52:20.060]  the, the bulk of the moral consequence will be brought down on the people who are actually
[52:20.060 --> 52:26.260]  taking the behaviors themselves, not the ones who are going to just order the behaviors.
[52:26.260 --> 52:32.060]  Now that is not to say that there isn't still consequence for those who are giving the orders,
[52:32.060 --> 52:39.020]  but the brunt and the bulk of the moral culpability always falls upon the shoulders of the people
[52:39.020 --> 52:46.320]  who are in with their bodies, taking the real world action to bring the resultant harm into
[52:46.320 --> 52:51.940]  manifestation in the physical world. That is why it is so important to disconnect the
[52:51.940 --> 52:58.940]  mind from these people's worldview from their, from the, the religion that they are inculcating
[52:58.940 --> 53:04.180]  the human population into, which is Satanism and dark Luciferianism, but it's certainly
[53:04.180 --> 53:12.140]  Satanism for 100% certainty. They are giving us their mindset to get us to go along with
[53:12.140 --> 53:17.500]  the immoral behaviors that they want to see brought into effect because only a population
[53:17.500 --> 53:20.620]  that is completely immoral can ultimately be enslaved.
[53:20.620 --> 53:23.220]  That's right. They're giving us, that is where we're at. They're giving us a poison.
[53:23.220 --> 53:27.460]  That's why it was declassified in the 70s. The CIA wanted ugly art, ugly culture, destroy
[53:27.460 --> 53:32.580]  the family because that, those people aren't programmable and controllable, but just like
[53:32.580 --> 53:36.180]  in Pinocchios and archetype, they get them to break some stuff, steal stuff. They turn
[53:36.180 --> 53:40.860]  into jackasses and get loaded on a slave ship to go be in a mine and they're telling you
[53:40.860 --> 53:44.540]  there, you do this, you hang out with the criminals, there's a system setting you up
[53:44.540 --> 53:48.860]  to get you basically in their grasp.
[53:48.860 --> 53:57.700]  The very first two tenets of their religion are the self is essentially God. The ego that
[53:57.700 --> 54:04.060]  is completely out of balance and out of control and is taken over the being is to be put up
[54:04.060 --> 54:11.460]  on a pedestal as the God of their religion. So, egotism, only care for the self and what
[54:11.460 --> 54:18.540]  one gets is the main tenet of their worldview. Now, just apply that to the average person.
[54:18.540 --> 54:25.820]  Just think about if we just honestly consider how many people embody behavior like that
[54:25.820 --> 54:31.340]  in the general human population, how many people are purely selfish. Basically, they
[54:31.340 --> 54:37.540]  generally wake up only thinking about themselves, maybe their immediate family, their own quote
[54:37.540 --> 54:43.260]  unquote, but they don't look outside of anything in a wider sense than that. They don't lead
[54:43.260 --> 54:47.900]  an examined life. They're not really concerned with the difference between right and wrong.
[54:47.900 --> 54:52.420]  They're very one-dimensional. They're very one-dimensional. And how do you get somebody
[54:52.420 --> 54:56.500]  who's already caught in that one-dimensional, programmable dimension to shift out of it
[54:56.500 --> 54:58.260]  and realize the interconnectivity?
[54:58.260 --> 55:03.380]  Well, I think that's actually the good news in the whole dynamic that's taking place on
[55:03.380 --> 55:12.140]  this planet because the fact is that human beings are a programmable species. And unfortunately,
[55:12.140 --> 55:19.340]  Mark O'Cultus have largely given human beings their current programming. That can change
[55:19.340 --> 55:26.180]  if there's enough care and there's enough willpower to create a change in that dynamic
[55:26.180 --> 55:33.180]  and in that regard. We can reprogram ourselves and we can help other people to reprogram their
[55:33.180 --> 55:34.180]  mental worldview.
[55:34.180 --> 55:37.180]  And it's basically to me like you're a satellite dish. You point towards God, the creator of
[55:37.180 --> 55:40.700]  the universe and the perfection of it and surrender to it. That's what made you. That's
[55:40.700 --> 55:45.780]  what you are. Or you can keep with operating and point your dish at the mad scientist who
[55:45.780 --> 55:48.340]  are trying to break out of this reality.
[55:48.340 --> 55:56.060]  Absolutely. It's all about reprogramming your worldview through the accurate reception of
[55:56.060 --> 56:01.620]  the law of the creator of the universe. That is what learning natural law is all ultimately
[56:01.620 --> 56:08.220]  about. And these conditions that are set into the universe are not there acting as a prison
[56:08.220 --> 56:17.100]  system. They are there for our optimum benefit and growth as a species. They are there to
[56:17.100 --> 56:26.500]  provide us a guide on a compass, if you will, for our behavior. And we learn the consequences
[56:26.500 --> 56:27.500]  of our behavior.
[56:27.500 --> 56:33.060]  We learn that we cannot ultimately be completely insulated from any behaviors that we take.
[56:33.060 --> 56:39.860]  And therefore we're going to create consciously if we know these laws. If we refuse the reception
[56:39.860 --> 56:46.100]  of the natural laws of the creator of the universe, which are moral behavioral consequential
[56:46.100 --> 56:52.940]  laws, then we're going to create the aggregate experience that humanity then is going to
[56:52.940 --> 56:56.500]  have to dwell in and live in completely unconsciously.
[56:56.500 --> 57:02.100]  So this is ultimately what I am seeking to do. I'm trying to help people understand the
[57:02.100 --> 57:07.180]  consequential laws that ultimately govern our behavior and the consequences that we
[57:07.180 --> 57:15.180]  receive for enacting certain behaviors and guide them to learn objectively what the real
[57:15.180 --> 57:22.820]  moral laws are so that we can create a shared human condition that is done in not only a
[57:22.820 --> 57:30.100]  conscious manner, but is done in the optimum way to enhance the human experience, make
[57:30.100 --> 57:33.460]  us prosperous and ultimately make us free in the long term.
[57:33.460 --> 57:36.660]  Absolutely. Mark Pascio, we've got five more minutes with you than our next guest is coming
[57:36.660 --> 57:40.140]  on. You've got to come back for several hours, commercial free again, and really lay all
[57:40.140 --> 57:44.300]  this out. Like why at the Olympics 2012 in England, they show a grim reaper coming down
[57:44.300 --> 57:49.380]  with the deadly coronavirus and killing all the children.
[57:49.380 --> 57:54.660]  It's your last chance to own a piece of real history. Your support of Info Wars has made
[57:54.660 --> 57:59.100]  history. We've had the most devastating effects against the globalist and their whole agenda
[57:59.100 --> 58:03.660]  is in deep trouble, but now it's more important for us to stay on air than ever. And if you
[58:03.660 --> 58:09.420]  don't support us, we will shut down. I am asking you for the bottom of my heart to commit
[58:09.420 --> 58:14.060]  even harder to the support you've given to this fight and to go to infowarstore.com right
[58:14.060 --> 58:19.380]  now and get one of the last signed copies of the Great Reset and the War for the World,
[58:19.380 --> 58:24.140]  my number one worldwide bestseller. You can buy the unsigned book at Info Wars, you can
[58:24.140 --> 58:28.420]  buy it at Amazon, buy it anywhere, but if you want to get the signed copy and be part
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.500]  of a fundraiser to keep us on air at this critical point, if you want to answer our
[58:31.500 --> 58:36.660]  bat signal, please go to infowarstore.com and get your signed copy of the Great Reset and
[58:36.660 --> 58:40.900]  the War for the World right now. I want to thank all of you that did get signed copies
[58:40.900 --> 58:44.500]  and I want to encourage those of you that didn't to take action now and please keep
[58:44.500 --> 58:49.220]  us on air. Thank you so much. Please take action.
[58:49.220 --> 58:54.380]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive
[58:54.380 --> 58:58.620]  ripple effect throughout time and space. We're actually winning the Info War and when you
[58:58.620 --> 59:04.140]  realize that Band-Aught Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative
[59:04.140 --> 59:09.260]  journalists, a talk show host whose information is beyond incredible. Hundreds of medical
[59:09.260 --> 59:14.460]  doctors and scientists, all of them right now telling the truth at Band-Aught Video.
[59:14.460 --> 59:18.740]  Millions of people today visiting Band-Aught Video, but you can take that information and
[59:18.740 --> 59:23.180]  cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your
[59:23.180 --> 59:28.980]  friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers. You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[59:28.980 --> 59:34.180]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it. When you decide to take action, we as
[59:34.180 --> 59:39.740]  a species and as a race are invincible. So I thank you all for your past action and I
[59:39.740 --> 59:44.420]  challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting
[59:44.420 --> 59:45.420]  on you.
[59:45.420 --> 01:00:11.420]  All right folks, final segment Mark Passio and a bunch of other special guests are coming
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.860]  up here in just a few minutes. Part of this marathon broadcast, two wins are midnight tonight
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.420]  and I can pick his brain all day but I've said a lot of history, a lot of natural law,
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.620]  how the globalist operate. I tell you this guy very cogently in the most articulate way
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:27.580]  it's being done lays it out. He just sticks the rules and the laws of this so people get
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.700]  that and then they get everything. But I found one of the great ways to wake people up is
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:35.300]  to show them the manipulation and explain why these formulas are carried out. But here's
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:39.460]  an example. I'm not saying aliens are coming here from a foreign planet. I read what the
[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:43.020]  globalists say. They want to break out of the prison. They believe this is a simulation.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.300]  They now know the dark matters five times stronger than this matter. So they figured
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.580]  out that God's real and they actually admit that. None of them are atheist at the highest
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:54.740]  levels. They admit that. But they want to be God so they're using us to test on. But
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.980]  an example of that is where they constantly say in their literature, we're going to become
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:02.700]  God. We're going to become the aliens. We're going to make the aliens here on earth. We're
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.500]  going to make you accept it. And they're already doing that with new species and cross species
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:11.380]  and synthetic life and all this crap. Here's John Kerry yesterday at the Davos group saying
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:17.820]  what they're doing to revolutionize and save us from carbon or carbon based is like extraterrestrial
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:24.740]  like aliens are doing it. So they really believe that they're acting like the Nephilim or like
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:30.460]  God. And what you read about in ancient text, not just the Bible is happening again. So
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.900]  there's a whole other level of that. And in closing, I want to get his take on it. But
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:41.380]  here's the short clip of John Kerry. And when you stop and think about it, it's pretty extraordinary
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:49.500]  that we select group of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:55.940]  lives are able to sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:03.220]  planet. I mean, it's so almost extraterrestrial to think about saving the planet. If you said
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:08.100]  that to most people, most people, they think you're just a crazy tree hugging lefty liberal,
[01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:13.380]  you know, do good or whatever. And there's no relationship. But really, that's where
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.380]  we are.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:19.100]  And they're saying we're failed word fallen, they've got to fix us. And then everything
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.820]  they actually do, I know you know this when you study it is hurt people. What do you make
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.980]  of these statements?
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:31.100]  They are ultimately transhumanists. They are trying to degrade humanity to the point where
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:38.500]  we are no longer human. And when that condition comes about, you have a population that is
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:45.740]  it's very, very simple to rule them as chattel slaves. And that's ultimately what they're
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:52.780]  trying to do. They're trying to do that through technology. They are technocrats as well.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:57.980]  They are trying to do that through the pharmaceuticals that they pump the human population full of,
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:03.260]  the chemicals and the food, the air, the water, et cetera. And they're doing that through
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:09.460]  mind control through what is known as epigenetic programming. If people listening take away
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:14.500]  one thing about who these people really are, they are dark occultists, which means that
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.460]  they are very ancient psychologists. And what they what our society ultimately is run by
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:28.820]  is a technocratic occultocracy. And I know that's a big mouthful, but it means they're
[01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:33.740]  technocrats, meaning they're going to ultimately implement their rule through technology in
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:40.300]  many different forms. And they are an occultocracy, which means that who is ultimately running
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:47.060]  the hierarchy of power is dark occultists. They are an occult order. They are hidden
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:54.900]  controllers that are ultimately master psychological manipulators. This is what we have to demystify
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:04:03.540]  the occult world as. It's not sorcerers in big hooded dark robes conducting massive rituals
[01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:09.060]  out in the clearing in the woods. That is a component of the occult. But what it ultimately
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:16.660]  is, it is the most advanced psychology that has ever been learned and known and kept hidden
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:23.700]  by human beings throughout the entire history of humanity. And if people who have that deep
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:30.460]  knowledge of the human psyche want to manipulate people who don't know anything about those
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.780]  levels of psychology, again, it is child's play for them to do so. That's why we have
[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.580]  to wise up. We have to become street smart, and we need to level the playing field.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.740]  That's right. You're giving, we're giving them the owner's manual. We're breaking the
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:48.180]  matrix. Incredible job, Mark Passio, one on Earth happening dot com. We'll talk to you
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:51.180]  very, very soon. I can't wait to meet you in person anytime you want to come to the

[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:35.120]  doing right through midnight tonight. It is also a fundraiser to help keep us on air,
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.100]  but Ho, bone tell comes up on my show. He's funny. Some of the time. But he's also really
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:45.760]  serious. But when you watch a show online, and it's really hilarious. Here he is on Fox,
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.760]  not in another part.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.300]  Would you buy this hotel?
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.460]  Yeah. Climate change has racist. I walked out the house the other day and the clown called
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:07:06.100]  I think that's a first I think that's a first but I said I said jokes on you I
[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.820]  didn't vote for Biden I ain't black
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:20.500]  I have no idea I have no idea how we're going to deal with that when it
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:28.620]  edit the best bakery joke I've ever heard
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:39.780]  where am I and it goes on and on and on and on he joins us coming up now
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:44.220]  next drew Hernandez Gavin McGinnis dr. Judy Mikovits and a bunch of other
[01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:47.700]  special guests Roger Stones of Anna Hernandez Darren Beatty Matt Baker
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.940]  Dan Dix Tom Renz J Dyer with big spars update you know I miss that 730 tonight
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:57.780]  Edward Dowd Mickey Willis of Studio Alex Stein dr. Stella Immanuel Robert
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.020]  Barnes and so much more but hotel good to have you here my friend we didn't talk
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.740]  before you came on you said what do you want to hit me with I said whatever you
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.220]  want to hit you said I want to hit Davos well that's exactly where I'm at man
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.260]  what do you make of the announcements they're making how they run the world
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.660]  but if you say that you're evil and should be censored and they're like
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.940]  aliens come to save the earth I played that clip earlier we'll play it again in
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.260]  a moment Klaus Schwab talks about the disinfo and how well they're the number
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:28.020]  one enemy I mean it is on first things first I'd like to inform the people that
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:35.100]  today is a very important day in Info Wars history we are fundraising and we
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:41.380]  do need the people's help to keep the station at tip-top shape because
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:46.940]  obviously it's been under attacked by the establishment so I just want to put
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:53.580]  that out there first or foremost glad to be here as far as Davos is concerned the
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:59.700]  way it appears to me is the real power controllers have sent their workers out
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:03.620]  to Davos and the real power controllers are somewhere else for example we look
[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:08.020]  at Jekyll Island Jekyll Island was a very secret meeting I'm a bit leery
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:13.620]  about this Davos thing being so public is it important that we keep an eye on it
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.580]  absolutely is it important that we pay attention to the messages coming out of
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:23.980]  Davos absolutely these people are definitely planning our future economically
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.780]  and socially so we should pay attention to it I just don't want people to get
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:35.180]  too distracted by it and understand that there is a deeper darker force behind
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.380]  these people that they sent out here now if you look at the list of people it's
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.540]  mostly women I'm saying no these people aren't the real decision-makers no sex
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:47.460]  of a system involved in that but um no that means true the globalists are now
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.340]  recruiting women as their front because we take women as as as war not what you
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.980]  said is totally right Davos was created by the Bilderberg group which is secret
[01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:58.900]  which actually is the highest level which is their spokesperson to push their
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:02.740]  agenda but really it's the globalist putting their puppets on display it's a
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.500]  big giant puppet show where where they go this is the elite this is their
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:11.700]  agenda but but meanwhile it's a lot bigger please continue yeah and that has
[01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.660]  been proven in the past by your work I remember watching you go and you had to
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:19.980]  sneak in to Bilderberg group I remember when you had to sneak into the Bohemian
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:24.940]  Grove meetings you don't exactly have to do that with Davos so Davos is a
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:31.820]  big front but um the crazy part is the normies are not even hit the Davos they
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:35.300]  have no idea what's going on over there they have no idea what type of plans are
[01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:42.420]  being made but you do have to pay attention to it economics is basically
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.620]  the facilitation of scarce goods and resources amongst the population of
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:51.100]  people whoever controls the economics controls the people we're seeing that now
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.660]  with inflation with the recession people are feeling it some people are saying a
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:11:01.900]  GDP numbers are up that's fake news okay the GDP numbers are not up you cannot
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.740]  go up from negative you can only come back to zero and that's what they like
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:10.060]  to make you think is that the economy is recovering no the economy is trying to
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.140]  come back to zero after they put us in negative 10 negative 100 whatever it is
[01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:18.620]  exactly they raise inflation 30 percent the last few years and then say oh it
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:23.820]  only grew by point two percent the last few months exactly but you destroyed it
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.820]  previously and then you also have to take into account the growth that would
[01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:33.940]  have been in the economy had they not destroyed it so not only do you have to
[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:38.100]  make it to zero you have to make it to zero based upon where the economy would
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:43.460]  have been if they did not shut down New York California and the other major
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:47.540]  markets by the way you're right they admitted it Davos and again it was the
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:50.780]  you and the globalist above them that they basically did the shutdown to save
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.060]  the earth as a carbon lockdown and that they want to force the old system to
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:57.740]  bankrupt to accept their new system which is even viable why would they want to
[01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:02.660]  post-industrial world why do they want the average person poor hotel out of
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:08.060]  chaos is their excuse to create order and their excuse to create order means
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:17.060]  giving them more control over the economy people social life etc etc when
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:22.220]  you look at how people have been moving over the past few years they have been
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.900]  organized you notice that black and white people were coming together and they
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:29.980]  used the Trump admin to create a greater divide amongst us so you also have the
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:35.740]  divide and conquer tactic that's being employed here but ultimately it just
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.340]  comes down to control right they if you can't manage yourself somebody else to
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.780]  come in and manage you for you and then what they want to do is they want to
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:49.540]  inject you with their poisonous inoculations and we've seen various
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.380]  videos come out just saw a mother grieving about her mother taking her
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:58.060]  son who wanted to play sports and getting him inoculated and now he's not even
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:03.340]  eligible to play sports because he has an irregular heartbeat absolutely a
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:07.820]  shame and then we have the intellectual class who has led us astray the
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:13.340]  intellectual class has told us to go out and go get the inoculation and they
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:16.420]  still haven't been held accountable I'm not gonna name any names and that was a
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.940]  chance wanted to see what they get away with oh absolutely people on the left
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:25.340]  and right were controlled when it came to that or duped either controlled or
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.380]  duped I don't like to speculate either way either way they were wrong either way
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:33.580]  your intellectual class has failed you your blue check verified people on
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:39.900]  Twitter have failed you and the whole steps are right Alex Jones was right we
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.540]  warned you people Alex Jones told you guys this stuff was gonna happen at
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:49.140]  least 10 10 20 years ago and now that it's here people want to make Alex
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.220]  Jones feel like he's the bad guy they don't want to allow allow him on social
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.980]  media why they don't want to allow him on Twitter I'll tell you why because he
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.260]  would have been ahead of the game he would have warned people about the
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:04.100]  dangers that were coming this is nothing but this swine flew in 1976 all over
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.100]  again they try to tell people that there was some epidemic pandemic coming
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.740]  turned out it was a huge nothing burger but a bunch of people ended up with
[01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:19.020]  Asperger's or something like that and it turned out to be a huge experiment where
[01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:26.580]  people's lives were challenged were put in danger some were lost and we're seeing
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:30.340]  it at a global scale now which goes back to the whole population control
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:34.580]  agenda we know the population control agenda comes in various forms abortion
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:40.260]  LGBT ism and now they're doing it through forced inoculations it's
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:43.980]  practically forced because people's livelihoods were put on the line you
[01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:48.740]  might get fired from your job you might you know the military mandated it now
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.460]  the Pentagon says they want to roll it back they are now arresting people in
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:56.420]  Germany that don't take it and I see the videos read the articles and in the UK
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:15:02.700]  they are coming and getting special needs children and the state says you're not
[01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.020]  allowed to not give it to them their special needs we're gonna make them take
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:10.100]  it I mean this is so dangerous this is the highest levels of tyranny the
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:17.060]  planet has ever seen yeah I mean the sad part is it's not in your face like
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:24.940]  Stalin it's not in your face like Lenin it's behind your back it's it's in front
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:30.820]  of your face but behind your subconscious mind it's covert it's hidden
[01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:34.620]  and that's what makes this so dangerous it'd be different if they just rounded
[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:38.500]  everybody up but no they're they're actually doing it right from your face
[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.100]  and using the people you trust to convince you that this stuff is safe and
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.060]  using women challenging your livelihoods stay there we're running it's
[01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:47.820]  nothing against women it's true they admit they're using women as their front
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.860]  because we biologically see a woman it's not threatening because we never got
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.500]  attacked by women in history so they're sending armies of women out to carry
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.540]  this out but they're really soldiers of the globalist we'll be right back with
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:16:04.700]  anyone else ladies and gentlemen this is your last chance to get a historic

[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.440]  you we were going to be shut down. They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.000]  None of that's true. It's all being appealed. They want you to think InfoWars is dead. But

[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.240]  will not be taken off the air. But if they can convince you that we've been shut down,

[01:03:43.380 --> 01:20:36.120]  please remember listeners, we got about a $230,000 underage on average the
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.760]  last six months, which was fine because I had saved about $3 million that I had just
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:45.600]  in the bank over the years. Sounds like a lot for operations big. It's a very small
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.600]  reserve tank. That's all gone. And then we got a big Bitcoin donation. That's gone.
[01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:56.480]  But we're stabilized. If we can just get about $200,000 extra to catch up where we were and
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.600]  be able to buy product into the future. We're appealing all these fake rulings. We'll be

[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:09.800]  back to Hotep Jesus, I got to play this clip. This is John Kerry likening this elite group
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.000]  saving the world to space aliens. Here it is.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.440]  And when you stop and think about it, it's pretty extraordinary that we select group
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:27.480]  of human beings because of whatever touched us at some point in our lives are able to
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:33.640]  sit in a room and come together and actually talk about saving the planet. I mean, it's
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:39.760]  so almost extra-terrestrial to think about, quote, saving the planet. And if you said
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.160]  that to most people, most people, they think you're just a crazy tree-hugging, lefty, liberal,
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.960]  you know, do-getter, whatever. And there's no relationship. But really, that's where
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960]  we are.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:57.240]  Folks, you can't get more evil than John Kerry and their whole agenda up there. Why
[01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:03.920]  can't himself to God, basically, the metaphor aliens? What do you make of that, Hotep?
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.240]  Oh, the road to good intentions are paved in hell. I'll have what that phrase goes.
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.560]  I like the way you say it.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:20.360]  Here's the issue. Any time you have somebody who leads their campaign off with, I'm going
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:27.800]  to save the world, either lying to you or extremely ignorant. The world does not need
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:35.480]  saving. What the world needs is for big government and big tech to get out of people's way.
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:40.960]  If they did that, the world would come back to homeostasis. The reason why things are
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:47.160]  bad is because we have manipulation of money, manipulation of markets, and manipulation
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.120]  of minds. If everybody just minded their business, well, if the big corporations just minded
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.560]  their business, for example, when it came to the inoculations, always going to come
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:05.560]  back to this, Twitter suspended a bunch of accounts, YouTube suspended a bunch of accounts
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:10.200]  limited what you could say, limited what you could not say. You can't even talk about
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:13.680]  the Ukraine crisis on YouTube, etc., etc.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:20.400]  These are the things that inhibit the truth. Anytime you have people, for example, if you
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.640]  come on my platform and you want to talk, you could say whatever you want. I'm not going
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:29.400]  to inhibit your truth. That's because I know I'm standing good on my truth and I trust
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:33.800]  that people can make their own decisions. What is the argument that Alexander Hamilton
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:40.480]  made when he wanted to establish a central bank? He basically said people don't have
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.960]  the ability to think for themselves. So we have to think for them. So that's why he wanted
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:51.680]  to install a central bank to manage the money of the world, the money of the country.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.440]  The sad part is, it's just like a child. If a child falls and you pick the child up every
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:02.320]  time the child will never learn how to pick itself up. It will never learn how to walk.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.800]  It will never learn how to live, how to thrive. Well, the same thing happens when it comes
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:12.800]  to markets. If you don't allow people to lose money in a market, how are they going to learn
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:19.120]  how to make money in a market? So what they did was, they created these central banks,
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:23.320]  these central banks come about. I wrote a white paper on it called the Paycheck Report.
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:29.240]  These people come around and then they control the money from a central place. Then what
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:35.320]  they do is, they do the opposite of what you're supposed to do. For example, if the economy
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.480]  is booming, wouldn't it make sense to increase interest rates if you wanted to manipulate
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:46.000]  the market in a proper manner? No, they lower the interest rates. And when an economy is
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.080]  doing bad, what do they do? They raise the interest rates. It's the opposite of what
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.160]  you're supposed to do. Even Thomas Sowell says you wouldn't pass an econ one-on-one class
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.880]  with him. Exactly. That goes back to the first thing you said. They sell it like they're
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.480]  saving us, but no, they're using all the power they centralized to enslave us and keep us
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.120]  poor to control us. It's sick because they're not making all the perfect mistakes on accident.
[01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.040]  It doesn't matter what country where they run it. They do the same thing if they want
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.000]  to destroy you.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.800]  This is an attack on traditionalism. This is an attack on conservatism. They like to
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.280]  throw around his word racist. And I used to fall for that stuff. And I got real hip and
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.880]  I realized none of this stuff actually has to do with race. This has everything to do
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:35.400]  with ideas. And the main idea is conservatism. For example, when we look at a wonderful black
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:43.880]  female judge, Janice Rogers Brown, huge conservative Biden, Obama, Clinton, all of them voted against
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:50.160]  her taking a chair. I believe it was in DC. I forget which circuit court that was. Janice
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.760]  Rogers Brown, you have to go look up this woman and do your studies on this woman.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:00.200]  She had this one case, Aguilar versus Avis, and there were some racial undertones happening
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:06.120]  at the workplace. And she says, these people have a First Amendment right. If that's how
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.600]  they want to run their business, that's how they should run their business. And that to
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:14.040]  me is sound judgment.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:20.400]  You have to allow the free market to handle businesses. If you want to discriminate based
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:27.680]  upon race, I believe anybody should have that right too. The business is going to suffer
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.600]  when people find out how you treat your people or how you do or don't do business. And this
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:39.280]  is another attacking article opposed to confirmation of Janice Rogers Brown. It comes out of the
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:44.280]  civil rights org, the civil rights org attacking a black woman. They tell you, oh, but black
[01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:49.880]  women, but black women, no black women that think like them are the only ones they want.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:55.680]  They don't want black women who think with sound logic and rationale. Absolutely. We're
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.480]  out of time. You got to come back and co-host or come back on soon. HoTipJesus.com. HoTip
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.000]  in closing. Looks like they're getting ready to dump Biden.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:12.160]  Yes. I did notice that. And he's just not fit for the job. And maybe they're going to
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.000]  slide somebody in there. I'm keeping an eye on that. I think they may skip next election
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.880]  and try to get an establishment Republican in the, in the seat. I'm taking a look at
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:26.880]  Pence. I think Pence might, might want to make a run at it, but I'm more afraid of an
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:34.040]  establishment Republican than a Democrat because well, there you go. HoTipJesus. Smart as they
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:39.760]  come. We love you brother. We'll talk to you soon. God bless you. God bless. All right.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.960]  We got some other amazing guests coming up. Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.240]  one hell of a broadcast today. Right through midnight. Please spread the word about the
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:53.800]  broadcast. Yes, she's coming up. Drew Hernandez, then Gavin McInnis, Hunter Judy Megavits,

[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.040]  The information war. There's nothing you can do more important than keeping info wars
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:20.960]  on air and the fight for liberty. I don't think anybody denies that fact. And I thank

[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:02.800]  for your support. The second American revolution is happening right now against the new world
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:10.640]  order. And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset and info wars embodies
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.800]  that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny. Now in the last year, we've done
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:21.280]  a very successful fundraiser of silver coins. When you buy the coin, you know that you are

[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.280]  done with this because it's a fundraiser. But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:01.280]  at 1776 on what coins remain. Please go to 1776 coin dot com right now. I talk a lot about
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:07.080]  the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it is because
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:11.360]  of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at info wars, people
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:18.440]  behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.440]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day
[01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:28.560]  five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole info
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:33.560]  wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to realize that info
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.840]  wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word. I know you
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:42.000]  pray for us. That's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners never go
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.960]  to info wars store dot com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.400]  life. All at the same time, give us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.880]  actually go buy products and force where I come. If just 1% more of you took action
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:58.480]  and went to enforce where I come, our funding problems will be over. Please take action
[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:03.880]  now. I'm Dr Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:11.080]  wellness company. An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post COVID world

[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:35.560]  diagnostics, prescriptions, treatment packages specifically for COVID, post COVID, vaccine
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:42.000]  injury syndromes and all the usual things that are seen in primary care. And then we
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.840]  have an entire array of holistic products and online store media and health advice.
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:57.320]  Come see the wellness company and go to online health now dot com as a conduit to the wellness
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:21.400]  company leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:33.920]  Well, Drew Hernandez exploded onto the scene years ago covering Antifa and he just has
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.400]  become one of the best talk show hosts out there. Super popular. He's again popping in
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:43.320]  with us for just the next 25, 30 minutes. We're having a new guest on every 30 minutes
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:47.840]  here today. And because they block him full wars dot com and band dot video on Instagram
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:53.840]  and Twitter and everywhere else, we have created new URLs and aren't just redirects, but are
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:57.840]  their own page with just the live feed of the show and then links to info wars and
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:03.960]  band dot video. We'll put that back on screen conspiracy fact dot info and Alex was right
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:10.080]  dot com. Alex was right dot com. You share those URLs, not just our guests that are coming
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.720]  on and it creates huge synergy and massive numbers of extra new people tuning in that
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.680]  are awake, but not all the way awake or who are totally on awake. So there's the URLs
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:25.160]  and the hashtag Alex was right. And this is a fundraiser to try to keep us on air. Now,
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:29.520]  I was asking Drew Hernandez because I set him up for the show a few days ago. But it's
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.840]  always topical. What do you want to hit first and he's right down my alley. And then I wondered
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.480]  why a bunch of Davos clips I didn't see last night this morning because I send the crew
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:42.840]  the clips I want. They give me some to why there were a bunch of clips in there that
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:47.280]  I hadn't found. Well, it turns out he sent these to us. So that's why we've got Kerry
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:52.400]  saying they're space aliens saving Earth. Claw Schwab saying a bunch of really cryptic
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.200]  stuff. Brian Stelter is now one of them. We've got a really ridiculous clip of him. We're
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.280]  going to go over all this with Drew Hernandez right now as the globalist puppets. These
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.600]  are the puppets of the actual globalist meet and sell their horrible agenda. So Drew Hernandez,
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.160]  thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for joining me, Alex. We are here for such a time
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:16.160]  as this hashtag. Alex Jones was right. I think it's pretty abundantly clear, especially
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:20.280]  if you're tracking what they're talking about in Davos and Switzerland right now, which
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:24.360]  is nothing new. But I'm thankful that a lot of people, I think millions of people are
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.440]  waking up to the reality that there is a real shadow government. It's like not even not
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:33.160]  so much shadow anymore. They're out in the open and they openly talk about the topics
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.520]  of their digital VR AR tyranny that they want to impose on humanity. They're openly talking
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:43.360]  about censorship and going against anyone that doesn't want to take a COVID vaccine.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:47.720]  That's literally what Brian Stelter was talking about in Davos like a couple hours ago. So
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:51.440]  a lot to cover today, Alex. And let's go wherever you want to go, brother. I'm with you.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.240]  Well, no, I mean, you're you're the guy that sent us a clips. I've seen them. They're insane.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:02.040]  Brian Stelter, Newark publisher, disinformation existential threat, New York Times publisher
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:06.040]  compares Trump, rhetoric to Stalin and Hitler, where they're the ones following that. Representative
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.760]  makes it hard to get shops in arms, New York Times publisher challenges to teach you kids
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:15.760]  to recognize this information. I mean, they are really scared. They're really concerned.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:22.360]  Let's play the Klaus Schwab clip first. They've all got to circle the wagons against people
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:25.480]  that don't want their world government. Here it is.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:33.720]  Corporation in a fact managed world. It's the beginning of this year. We are confronted
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:43.120]  with unprecedented and multiple challenges. We need to overcome the most critical fragmentation.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:51.960]  And the most critical fragmentation is between those who take a constructive attitude and
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:37:06.560]  those who are just bystanders, observers and even go into the negative, critical and confrontational
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.560]  attitude.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.600]  Wow, let's unpack that room.
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.080]  There it is out in the open. You know, you know who he's talking about. You know who
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:21.960]  has a negative and confrontational attitude. Okay, those that are critical against the
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.040]  world economic forum in the new world order. You want to know who Klaus Schwab is talking
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:30.520]  about. The man that people claim doesn't exist. The man that the deep state and the shadow
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:35.320]  government claim isn't real, that these people aren't out there in Switzerland meeting together
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.800]  talking about how they're going to oppose people that oppose their agendas that are satanic,
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.860]  that are tyrannical, that want to shut down the free world and shut down free humanity
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:45.860]  and their freedoms.
[01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:50.880]  He's talking about you, ladies and gentlemen. He's talking about Alex Jones. He's talking
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:56.440]  about info wars. He's talking about band on video. He's talking about the free world.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:01.120]  He's talking about the United States of America. He's talking about anybody that opposes everything
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:07.480]  that these people stand for, which is Satanism, Luciferianism and ultimate tyranny, not only
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:12.240]  in the real world, but they want to take it into a VR AR world as well because they want
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.120]  to control your mind. What he is talking about is opposing everything that you love, everything
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.320]  that you stand for, everything that you've ever known because they're envisioning a new
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.320]  world where it's controlled by these global elites, where it's a virtual reality matrix
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.440]  where you will own nothing and be happy and you will just absolutely accept everything
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.960]  they shoved down your mouth.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:37.520]  What Klaus Schwab says out in the open is what he means. A lot of people take a look
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.880]  at that guy and say, oh, he's just an old man that wants to, you know, not be a boomer
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.880]  and be an old wine skin that wants to get with the times and move us into the future.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.600]  Yeah. But with the tyrannical agenda that wants to impose literal slavery upon humanity,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:57.080]  and he says it out in the open that we need to overcome those that are critical against
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.840]  us, that have a negative mindset against us. This is the warrior in every single one
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:07.880]  of us watching right now are in this info war. Every single one of us are engaged. Every
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:12.680]  single one of us, we are all John Connor. We are all facing Skynet. We are all facing
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:18.040]  the AI takeover. We are all facing the technocracy. We are all facing the censorship. We are all
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:25.000]  facing these things that are opposing humanity and info wars.com, band.video info wars store.com
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.680]  is literally the tip of the spear and out front and center. That is why they are so
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:35.280]  banned. That is why they get demonized and slandered everywhere you look in the media.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.400]  You want to know why? Because Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all of these global elites know
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:46.360]  exactly what this network stands for. And it is to stand against them and their tyranny.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.000]  This is exactly why we need to support free speech systems. Because if we don't have this,
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.840]  if we don't have an alternative economy, if we don't have alternative media that is standing
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:00.400]  alone, standing their ground, we will get defeated by Skynet. We will get defeated by
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.480]  the new world order. And thank God people are waking up to the reality because of clips
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:13.400]  like this, that these people are A, in existence, B, homicidal tyrannical maniacs and C, they
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:18.680]  literally are opposing the free world and free humanity. This is why we need to support
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.480]  info wars because this is everything we stand for. It's bigger than Alex Jones. It's bigger
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:29.400]  than info wars. It's bigger than me. It's bigger than you. This is about free humanity.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:34.760]  This is about good versus evil and God fighting the devil. You've got to pick a side now.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.120]  Absolutely. Well, you were on fire, but it's all totally true. And I've got so many clips
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:44.080]  you sent. I've got clips where they say, let me read this quote here. We'll close when
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:49.480]  we come back, that they're creating a global collaborative village and Yvonne Harari goes
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.480]  on another clip to say you'll be forced into it by the government. So a digital concentration
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:58.880]  camp where they make you wear a digital hood over your head and where they control reality.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:03.600]  Digital cult programming. And here they are introducing hell on earth to us, Drew, like
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.280]  it's a good thing. I mean, it's crazy. They're going to take over our bodies. They're going
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.160]  to give us mRNA to take over our genes and fix our genes. They said that yesterday. I
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:18.560]  played the clip. I mean, these are maniacs. They're homicidal tyrannical maniacs, mad
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:24.600]  scientists. Okay, these bureaucrats that pontificate and walk around determining how humanity is
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:29.840]  literally going to go. Okay. All the stuff that Alex has been talking about for decades.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.760]  Okay. Coming to fruition and these people are out in the open and arrogantly saying
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:40.760]  it because they know that they're in a point in time where they can come out and say all
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:47.400]  their homicidal ideas with a smile on in your face because they know that they're in a position
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.840]  where you can do nothing and you will say nothing and you will not oppose them because
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.720]  if you do, you will get canceled silence, possibly even lose your life. That is what
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:01.640]  is in the minds of these people, but free humanity and the free spirit is still alive.
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:05.440]  That's why we are still here. And wherever the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.960]  and liberty and this spirit of freedom will always continue as we go forward into humanity.
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:15.640]  We're all Leonidas facing the evil Persian King. We are all Leonidas standing in the
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:19.960]  face of tyranny, not allowing these people to take us down and not allowing these people
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.720]  to literally walk over our freedoms. That is where we are right now. This, this, this
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.480]  is not us just, you know, speculating and I don't know. This is kind of like my own
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:34.280]  bias and my own opinion based off of, you know, a kind of shady clip I saw on the world
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.320]  economic world economic form. No, this is out in the open. It's real. They all talk
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:45.320]  about it. They want world domination and the energy we need right now is resistance, resistance,
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:52.880]  do not stop, do not get complacent, go overdrive, zero to a thousand, zero to 10,000 in five
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.880]  seconds.
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:59.880]  Who drew Hernandez is in Fuego.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:05.680]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing in force, attacking myself and
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.480]  the crew and our other hosts? Because they know we're pro human. They know we're telling
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:16.400]  the truth. They know we've got their number. They know everything we do is about empowering
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.680]  humanity. And God gave us through Mother Nature, incredible compounds that will supercharge
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:27.720]  our body, stamina, libido, energy and immune systems. And we came out many years ago with
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:33.840]  real red pill plus that has all the documented compounds like preglonone and so much more
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:41.240]  to supercharge your body and to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:47.120]  it needs to function at a proper level. This is the answer to the new world order's tyranny.

[01:44:45.480 --> 01:45:02.760]  be my slaves. I'm taking a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:07.880]  had great effects and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:12.640]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.120]  factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:21.600]  natural male potential. These products work great for women as well. Ladies and gentlemen,

[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.480]  of the spear and ensure we stand the field in this war against the new world order by

[01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:32.120]  and your family. They're coming for me. They're coming for the children. But to get to the
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.160]  children they've got to get through us first. These monsters are all over television wanting
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:39.600]  to give these shots to newborn babies. They're already given to pregnant women. Miscarriages
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.320]  are off the chart. 80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers
[01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:50.120]  after these poison shots. We can and will save the children and they are counting on
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:55.280]  us. Let's do it together and the fight starts at info wars.com and the fight continues with
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:00.880]  your financial support at infowarstore.com. Now take action now.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:07.880]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:18.520]  Welcome back folks. I can tell you we have millions of new listeners pouring into info
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:23.800]  wars.com right now to the URLs that get you there. You get past the censors conspiracy
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:30.120]  fact.info and alexwasright.com and it's thanks to your Hernandez and Hotep Jesus and Paul
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.760]  Joseph Watson and all the other Mark Passio and everybody that have been on the show already
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.280]  and all the great guests that were on with Harrison Smith during his show this morning.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.160]  And that's what it's about synergistically coming together and holding up the media
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.240]  organizations that are independent and told the truth and are fighting this false reality
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.600]  metaverse they're trying to force us into. They want to lock us down, make us work in
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:58.200]  these areas and you are raising this. Then I'm going to get to the John Kerry clip. But
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:05.760]  Davos watch. It's Klaus Schwab and Vice Chair, President of Microsoft, Brad Smith, unveil
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:12.960]  their vision of the global collaboration village. So a giant digital reeducation camp. Here's
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.920]  the clip. We'll get to Hernandez's take. The global collaboration village is a sub pioneering
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:28.600]  effort to use the metaverse for the public good to create global cooperation and to strengthen
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:35.360]  global cooperation in the metaverse or using metaverse technologies. And we are pleased
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:46.320]  to create this global collaboration village in cooperation with Accenture and with Microsoft.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:53.860]  So the idea is to bring all the stakeholders, governments, business, civil society together
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:49:01.640]  on a continued sustained basis. This is the next phase, the next big phase of development
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:09.200]  in the virtual world. It's especially important for this vision of a village without borders.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:17.080]  It's an open development process and it is an open development philosophy. We're creating
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:23.760]  at Microsoft through Microsoft Mesh a software platform that will be accessible to people
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:31.360]  through a variety of different hardware devices. This particular project in our view is of
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:38.200]  enormous importance for the world because of the role that the World Economic Forum
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:44.760]  plays in the world. This is an opportunity to create a village without borders.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:47.920]  So they want to control your body. They want to be able to organize people and bring third
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:52.000]  world populations in. They want to be able to lock you in your houses. There's so many
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.960]  facets to this. Or Hernandez, your take on it.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  Alex, talk about digital programming, right? I mean, aside from the issue of just jacking
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:05.540]  in your mind into a virtual reality system where they could obviously control everything
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:09.280]  that you see, everything that you hear and everything that they want you to believe.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.480]  We've talked about that many times on this show and on my show as well. But I also want
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:17.640]  people to kind of have this take away from that clip as well is they're continuing to
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:22.880]  push the no borders. The globalists are open borders because they don't view any sovereignty
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:26.920]  for any nations. They might give an appearance for that here or there because they want to
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:30.360]  utilize a nation like Ukraine because all of a sudden we can lock down their borders
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  and they can have sovereignty because they have an interest there with Ukraine, right?
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:38.360]  So nothing they do is actually genuine. They don't care. What I'm trying to say is notice
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:43.400]  how they continue to push for open borders. This is why the formerly known southern border
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:47.320]  of the United States of America is clearly open. This is why there's replacement migration
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.960]  in Europe as well where they're changing the demographics. They want to bring in people
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:54.200]  that can't even speak the native language so they could control those people from the
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:58.680]  top down. So they'll never show a fuss. They'll never protest. They will just do everything.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:05.520]  Oh, nothing. Be happy and just be good citizens of the so-called democracy that they established
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.360]  in the country that they were allowed to be in, right? They're slaves. What I'm saying
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:13.040]  is the reason why they want the open borders is because that is part of the anti-Christ
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:19.080]  anti-God agenda. The Bible has made it very clear that God has laid out drawn lines, border
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:24.640]  lines for specific countries for his specific purposes because in the end times in Bible
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:30.560]  prophecy God has specific nations unifying against the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.600]  So borders do matter because in the end you see God identifying separate countries in
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:41.440]  order for them to fulfill Bible prophecy on God's 10,000 view timeline, okay? So these
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:46.120]  people do everything that's in opposition towards God. It's the depopulation agenda.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:50.840]  It's the vaccine agenda to poison people with these poison shots to depopulate the earth,
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:51.840]  including abortion.
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:55.200]  They're passing our DNA. They said yesterday we're going to take over and fix everyone's
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:00.480]  DNA with mRNA shots. So now they admit it manipulates DNA. I mean, it's just insane.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:05.520]  Absolutely. So Alex, so if they can get you into some kind of VR reality, right, where
[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:11.200]  they're literally programming your mind in order to accept the ideology, notice how he
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.960]  uses those words, right? Alex, it's an ideology. It's an ideology. This is an ideology of the
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:22.440]  World Economic Forum. It's the consistent, continual, digital programming. It's the
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:27.760]  PSYOP being run and the propaganda. Okay, imagine propaganda in VR, man. People are
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:34.160]  going to lose their minds, Alex, pushing this globalist agenda, no borders, no USA at all,
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:40.240]  no wall, no nothing, no national sovereignty. So they get your mind prepared and propagandized
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:46.320]  on a direct level to accept their plans. This is part of bypassing your free will. This
[01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.360]  is why John Kerry comes out and says, we're pretty much extraterrestrials. The whole
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:55.520]  experience of us getting touched at some point in our life to have a savior complex to want
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.480]  to save the world. We all know what that is because we're a select group of people here
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:05.120]  at the World Economic Forum, the elite class mentality, believing that they are the saviors
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:12.000]  of the planet. That is anti-Christ, pseudo-Christ in the place of Christ. Okay, it's demonic.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.360]  These people are interfacing with Satan. They're interfacing with demons and their agendas.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:21.380]  Some people are unaware. They're just deceived going along with all the success and gaining
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:25.960]  everything that comes with worshiping the devil unknowingly. Some are intentional about
[01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:30.560]  it, Alex, and you know this. Some people are intentional about their Luciferianism and
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:36.440]  know that they're interfacing with higher beings, which they call aliens or extraterrestrial,
[01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:41.080]  which are fallen angels and demons passing along information because these fallen angels
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.720]  have been around longer than any one of us, and they know just exactly how to manipulate
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:49.200]  humanity and push the agendas of Satan. That is what you are watching.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.120]  And the only way to stop them is to be aware of it. And again, what do they do at Skull
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:56.760]  and Mones? They get the top lovelace kids, they send them there, and when they're in
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:02.480]  college, they go and they're reborn coffins, they bathe in feces, they have homosexual
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:09.880]  sex, and they all try to get one of the gods or goddesses to enter their body. And they've
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:14.240]  got a bunch of skulls and body parts of famous people in there. And it's a German death cult.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.600]  And I'm not blaming Germans, folks. Every culture has the same death cult. The Aztecs,
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.960]  the Africa have the same death cult. You know, how is it the same gods, the same devils,
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.520]  the same demons get worshiped by certain groups that then build temples and engage in human
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.120]  sacrifice because they're being influenced by interdimensional entities. And the globalists
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.720]  don't joke about this when I've been around some of them. They all know it, they follow
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:39.720]  it. They are, they are tapped in to fallen angels.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:47.720]  Absolutely. And Satan, the ultimate fallen angel himself is, okay, is literally ancient.
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:52.200]  This is what people need to understand. These entities have been around for thousands of
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.840]  years. Billions.
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.280]  Not just at the beginning in the garden, even before. We don't know eternity. We can't
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:06.280]  comprehend eternity, okay? These demons and fallen angels are not atheists. They know
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:09.320]  God exists. They know how powerful God is.
[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.160]  And let's be clear. Let's be clear. They show us this ugliness and all this to get us on
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.320]  board with that. They have rebelled. And so we have to understand that we have the Holy
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.320]  Spirit, God's transmission. So it seems insurmountable to be up against this. But no, we are new
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.880]  beings, God's created that have souls that can literally create things. We're made in
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.920]  the image of God. We're amazing. We've been given the ultimate power, free will. And this
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:39.200]  is our embryonic phase. And yes, God has allowed us to be tested. This is a test.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.760]  Precisely. That's why in the New Testament, okay, anytime you see Jesus Christ, okay,
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:50.880]  God in human flesh interacting with the disciples, interacting with people around Galilee, around
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:57.600]  Jerusalem, throughout his entire ministry, anytime Jesus was encountering demons, okay,
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:56:02.120]  spiritual fallen ones, what was their response? The demons would scream, would freak out and
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:06.120]  say, are you the son of God? They would speak through little boys. They would speak through
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:10.600]  the possessed ones. Are you the son? You're the son of God. Our time is not yet. Please
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:14.320]  don't send us to hell. Please don't send us to the abyss. You want to know why? Because
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:19.200]  they know the agenda. They know the timeline and they wanted to see humanity to plunge
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:24.800]  them into the lake of fire. So you burn forever, disconnected from God, never believing that
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:30.360]  your creator exists. That is the ultimate agenda. It's to get you separated from God,
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:35.040]  not just on this side of heaven, but even worse on the other side when you enter into
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:40.800]  eternity. That is the end game of all of this, this new world order agenda, world economic
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:44.640]  forum, Bill Gates. And they tell us through Hollywood, the movie Poltergeist, where the
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.960]  cult leader leads him out in the desert and kills him because he wanted the spirits of
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:51.760]  the children with him. And he's trying to have them lead him to the light. That's what Lucifer
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:58.000]  wants is to haul a bunch of us with him into his own dimension, which is hell. And why?
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.800]  Because the Bible says even he knows his time is short. His time is limited. So he's going
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:09.080]  to take as many souls as many spirits down with him when his time is double since the
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.680]  beast was wrapped because he knows his time is short. Drew, you got a lot of websites,
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:15.840]  a lot of shows. You're kicking ass. I see you everywhere. Where's the best place people
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.680]  to find everything of the man on fire? Drew Hernandez. Yeah, you guys can find me go
[01:57:20.680 --> 01:57:25.840]  to Twitter at drew h live. The links to my shows are all in the bio. I have my own podcast,
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.680]  drew h live, drew Hernandez live. That's exclusively on rumble. You could find that link there
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:35.280]  as well. And I host a show called front lines powered by T P. O. S. A. That is on real America's
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.040]  voice. All those links you guys can find in my Twitter, getter or truth social. We love
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:44.480]  you. Thank you so much. All right. Hour number three. Another big guest straight ahead. Stay
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:54.600]  with us. In the year 2000, Alex Jones's film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:58:00.800]  the world how our so called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:08.840]  service. That's us. In 2007, Alex Jones releases end game, exposing the world elites plans
[01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:15.240]  for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:22.440]  their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were there to warn the people
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:28.680]  of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming. This is why they attack us. This is why we
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:35.520]  need your support because we tell the truth. Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:42.160]  this Tuesday all day long. The Alex Jones was right. Marathon. Join us in the fight
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:50.360]  for freedom and help us defeat the new world order. There is a war on for your mind. Your
[01:58:50.360 --> 01:58:57.200]  mind is a battlefield. This is an information war. Info wars popularized those terms more
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:03.240]  than two decades ago. And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis or Dr. Robert
[01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:09.120]  Malone, they're all using the terms that info wars has popularized because we understand
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.120]  the enemy's operations and we know how to beat them. But we can't do it without funding.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.760]  And we make it easy to fund with great products and power you and your immune system and your
[01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:22.160]  family as well. You can also make straight donations at info wars.com clicking on the
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:27.440]  big red banner. A one time recurring. But I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.240]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on
[01:59:30.240 --> 01:59:35.640]  air, you are literally non violently politically punching the new world order in the nose, punching
[01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:40.040]  their lies in the nose. We are going to defeat the new world order. We're going over the

[01:59:53.880 --> 02:00:23.160]  order. It's Alex Jones. The great Gavin McKinnis is joining us coming up in the next segment
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:29.400]  here in about five minutes. And then Dr. Judy make a bit one of the biggest whistleblowers
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.920]  on the poison shots going back decades. He's incredible. We got Maria Z always does a great
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:38.760]  job, but she guest host the fourth hour with a bunch of big guests as well. Roger Stone,
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.160]  Savannah Hernandez from the Debo script with Switzerland, Darren Beatty with big breaking
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:49.400]  news, Matt Baker, Dan Dix, Tom Rims, Jay Dyer with a big update on spars. New information
[02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:53.200]  has come out. It's bone chilling. Very important to know. Edward Dowd obviously on the mass
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.360]  death and the ash worries know it's all coming on. Mickey Willis at studio, maker of plan
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:02.760]  Deming, Alan Stein, Dr. Stella, Emmanuel Robert Barnes and more right through midnight
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.960]  tonight. And I'll be back. I was going to be here at seven, but I'm just going to end
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:13.040]  up interrupting Jay Dyer with important information he's got. So I'm just going to let him host
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.400]  because he'll do a better job. I mean, I saw a report he did on this and it was all true
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.480]  about research. Good. He found out even more information is moving away. Ask him to come
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:24.560]  on and get more into it. I'll just spend 10 minutes on it. So that's coming up and it's
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.000]  about getting new people to the show. It's about synergy. It's about getting past the
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.120]  censors is about letting the globalist. So they're not going to win. All of our guests
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:34.200]  have been promoting. They're coming on. I want to thank them. The listeners are promoting
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:38.640]  the URL that takes you to a player of the show that can get around the sensors. They're
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.840]  blocking info wars and band up video on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, conspiracy fact dot info
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:50.880]  and Alex was right.com. And I'm sure in the next few days, the next few months, sometimes
[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:54.720]  it's a few days, sometimes a few months, they'll block those URLs too. You can always share
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:58.720]  them word of mouth and always share them on your email and your text message for now.
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:03.960]  Now, let me throw this out there because I'm the one that directed this fundraiser a couple
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:07.560]  weeks ago. I said, we need more funds. Let's do a fundraiser and they created a great site
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:12.440]  to get around the sensors. They did all that, but then I dropped the ball. The biggest part
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.840]  of a fundraiser to make it successful is people love a graph. People love to see how much money
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:23.960]  is coming in. I didn't think to tell the crew to put one in there or to have them check
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:27.720]  and then they have to manually put it in. We have plugins that'll do it, say off the
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:31.680]  shopping cart, but then you have other donations coming in, other ways money comes in. So they
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.400]  have to kind of hand enter that in, but I'll give you some updates, but here's what's going
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:40.240]  on. I'm behind about a million dollars. Sounds like a lot for the average person. I get it.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:45.240]  This is a pretty big organization. So it's not a problem except I've put all my backup
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:50.160]  money in. I don't have any money, which is fine. It doesn't hurt me in my ego. In fact,
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:53.360]  it kind of feels good that I've been totally committed like I said I would and all their
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:56.720]  lives, but I'm doing this for money and all the rest of its pure crap. We built one of
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:01.920]  the only truly independent organizations exposing the globalists and they say at Debo's their
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:06.480]  number one threat is anti-globalist exposing their agenda. We're wrecking them. You're
[02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:12.320]  wrecking them. So please go to infowarstore.com and I'll give you some updates here that I'll
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:18.000]  get during the break on how many funds have come in, but I'd be happy if we raised an
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.720]  extra $200,000 today because then I can do, I guess each month going out, maybe a fundraiser
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:29.320]  and kind of catch up we were at, but Christmas we didn't lose money because that's usually
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:34.480]  a big month, but the six, seven months before we did. And so Christmas, but they just did
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:38.960]  the math to the day actually meant it's about five months behind. So I've been saying six
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:42.720]  months, but it's actually about five months behind a little bit behind. So if you'll just
[02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:46.440]  go to infowarstore.com and get great products you already need, it's a win-win. And with

[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:17.400]  that could stop it? Well, we've done the research. We have the number one best selling book in
[02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:21.760]  the country, not just in politics, but period. It's the great reset in the world for the

[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:09.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:18.880]  Well, he's the host of the incredibly popular program. Get off my lawn. We'll put his URL
[02:06:18.880 --> 02:06:24.120]  up on screen for folks. There's few people out there that are in my league and I don't
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:27.680]  say that with enjoyment. I wish it wasn't the case, but he's definitely been as hunted
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:34.400]  and lied about and censored as I have censored.tv. Good friend of mine. He created Vice. He
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:40.760]  created the whole modern movement, several major movements. He's very, very iconic. The
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:46.040]  system fears him. Same reason they've gone after Andrew Tate is if they fear you and
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:50.200]  they see you changing the culture, particularly with young people and others, they come after
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:55.960]  you. So Gavin, in the last 25 years, brought in many of the things we see today that are
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.320]  staples, even though he then rejects a lot of them after left, has basically taken them
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:04.000]  over and ruined them. And I wanted to get him on about the Debo script, about the poison
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:10.440]  shot news coming out, just about all the craziness, but also the Twitter files and where he sees
[02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:15.880]  the next phase of this in civilization. Are we winning? Is the worm starting to turn?
[02:07:15.880 --> 02:07:20.480]  All over the news, they say Debo's is in trouble. Everybody hates him. You go on YouTube, 99%
[02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.920]  of the comments and some videos that have millions of views. I mean, we're talking hate
[02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:29.840]  their guts. Same thing on Twitter. So I'd like to believe we're winning, but also don't
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:36.520]  want to start celebrating too soon, like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, you know, until
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.000]  until we got the fish in the boat. So Gavin, we salute you, my friend from censored.tv.
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:47.120]  What's front and centered for you? Well, I think a good metric for where the country
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:53.080]  is at is how you and I are perceived. Like back when Trump was was becoming really unpopular
[02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:56.280]  with the left about a year after he's elected, when they really started coming after all
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:08:00.440]  his supporters and throwing them in jail, I would be get called a Nazi on the street.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:06.920]  Maybe one out of 10 times and the other nine would be nice. Now it's down to like one in
[02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:11.680]  a hundred and 99 are like, Hey, man, can I get a selfie? Well, I love what you're doing.
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.600]  Like some it's the worst. The worst I'll get these days is I don't agree with everything
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:19.760]  you say, but I appreciate that you're out there. And it's the same with you when I moved
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:24.440]  to New York in the late nineties. If you believed everything Alex said, you were a nut. But
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:29.680]  when you say outlandish things, and no one knows if they're true or not, you're a nut.
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.440]  When those would land outlandish things keep coming true, you're not a nut. And that, you
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:39.600]  know, that basketball player who wrote Alex Jones was right on his head recently, I think
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:45.720]  is more indicative of how you and I are perceived. I was put a list together here quickly. You
[02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:51.400]  said they're making the frogs gay. Yes, weed killers does make male frogs lay eggs. You
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:56.280]  said they're grooming our kids for sex. Now we have drag queen story hour. They're spreading
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:59.680]  their legs. I you brought this up a million years ago where they were twerking in front
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:03.640]  of kids and I thought, well, this will just be a quick fad. Nope, still stronger than
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:08.360]  ever. You said they're bringing this child sex ritual to our churches. And we've seen
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:13.640]  drag queen crap going on in church. They have the drag queens in the church now. You said
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:18.720]  that billionaires meet with presidents in the forest. A pohemian grove. That's all true.
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:23.160]  You said they meet at a sex island where they have sex with children that now that story
[02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:26.920]  was has been going on for a long time, but you put the Epstein thing on the map that
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:31.560]  woman sued him. The New York Times went near it once or twice. But as far as like when
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:36.640]  Joe Rogan and Tim Dillon discuss it, they're citing Alex Jones. You said the war in Iraq
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:40.600]  was fake. There's no WMDs. You said the government can control the weather. You warned that they're
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:47.200]  going to be create animal human hybrids. That's humanized mice goats. Cheap is incredibly
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:50.480]  common now. Well, not incredibly common, but it's all over the place. You talked about
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:54.320]  robots, robot human hybrids. That's happening. And then you said one of the weirdest ones
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.040]  that you said they're going to start using the blood of children to get a turn of life.
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:03.840]  And that just sounds nuts. But then there's the article. Rich people, elites are getting
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.400]  blood transfusions using adolescence blood. And they say it makes them feel a lot better
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.160]  and a lot healthier and they're going to live longer. So the freaks are right. The lunatics
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:19.000]  are running the asylum and we're the only ones calling them out. And I have definitely noticed
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.680]  walking around in public, even liberal cities like New York City, I'm getting 99% high fives.
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.080]  And I think that's a good sign. Have you, I totally agree. Have you found a paradox
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:32.760]  though where we're almost becoming passe and that now people know we're right, that we're
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:37.080]  not getting as much support or at least I'm not. We're struggling to stay on here. All
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.480]  I get is love everywhere now and my dinner bought for me. But at the same time, people
[02:10:40.480 --> 02:10:43.280]  like, oh, you're right now. You can retire. We all know the truth. Thank you. And I'm
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:46.800]  like, no, now we've got to stop their agenda. We don't want to just wake up and then let
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:50.800]  them rape us. We've got to now do something about it. I don't want to just be right. I
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:52.720]  want to wake people up to stop them.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:58.800]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm in this weird phenomenon at censored where people are scared to subscribe
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:02.920]  in case the deep state shuts them down. So it's almost like they're saying love. It's
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:07.120]  almost like they're opening a trap door from the, the ground and going, Hey man, love what
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:09.680]  you do. And then going back underground and locking it.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:14.240]  Perfect analogy. You're a genius. That's exactly what we're seeing folks and it's stupid. We're
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:17.560]  going to lose everything if you don't have courage. I know the general listener does,
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:22.000]  but we know that less than 1% of people actually buy stuff at m4sword.com. I could plug one
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.400]  time a day if 5% bought something instead. I'm like, please help us. And it's a question
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.640]  we do. We have banned out video that cost millions and millions a year to pay for the
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:35.320]  bandwidth hundreds of providers of contributors. We get something like 10 million views a day,
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.080]  but that costs money. So people want us to go build it. We've done it. It's free, but
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:43.040]  we need the support. People say, well, do a subscription, which you've been smart and
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:46.120]  done. And I'm like, yeah, but then we won't have the mega reach because that's what I
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.240]  want to have. So I don't know. I mean, we may have to do some subscription because I guess
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:56.040]  I got to do what I got to do here, Gavin. Yeah, I get people scared to say that they
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.760]  watch the show that when we get letters, they say, don't read my name on the air. And I
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:04.920]  go to those people. I go, you are censoring yourself. So you're doing the government's
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.200]  work for them. They don't have to show up for work. If we all censor ourselves, I end
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.040]  every show with get fired, get in trouble, be brave, never stop fighting. We can't be
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:17.120]  living in a society where you're not allowed to watch a show. You're not allowed to send
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:21.640]  a letter to a show. You should be reading all kinds of stuff. You should read Che Guevara
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:25.720]  speeches. You should read Hitler speeches. We can't be scared of information. People
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:31.920]  got to be a lot more brave and just say, fine, arrest me then. Put me on your hit list. You
[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:37.440]  got a black list. I want to be on it. Gavin, there's so much on your radar and I really
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.880]  respect you. All the guests we've had are amazing, but you're particularly amazing.
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:49.840]  What is front and center on your radar screen? This lie about white supremacy being the biggest
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:54.960]  threat to our nation. What it really means is I want to put Republicans in jail, conservatives
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:13:00.040]  in jail. So I need a magic wand where I can just dehumanize them, pretend they're a racist
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:04.280]  and now I'm arresting them for the racism. This bill that Sheila Jackson Lee is pushing
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:08.440]  that says only white people can be accused of racism. Black people can shove Asians down
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:13.400]  the stairs in New York City, but if a white guy's eagles, we got to throw them in jail.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:20.040]  And we saw those same lies destroy South Africa. We saw those same lies turn Rhodesia into
[02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:24.560]  the hell that is in Bobway. And we're definitely getting this third world trend like Joe Biden
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:29.920]  just the other day said white supremacy is the biggest threat. White supremacy in America
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:36.480]  is about as common as albino skateboarders and it is about as dangerous to the nation.
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:42.560]  Well, I'm white and I grew up in East Texas and that's the South, kind of the South kind
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:47.960]  of ends in Central Texas. It literally does. It's more Western. And all I heard was Christians
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:52.240]  and people and I'm hanging around with 50 deer hunters, World War two vets and all they
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.840]  were talking about is how they wanted to help black people wanted to end racism and all
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:14:02.400]  that stuff. And now under leftist rule, all I hear is about race from white people trying
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:06.960]  to make brown people racist and they're having a lot of success. It's it's insane. It's like
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.120]  that new Babylon B piece where it shows the black person going to a Republican meeting
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:14.160]  and they're literally worshiping them, kissing their ass. And I feel sorry for black folks
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:17.400]  because I've been to those meetings. It's like that. It's too over the top. I mean, a black
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:21.200]  person in a truck rally is literally carried around a red carpet and just they just want
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:26.040]  to be treated like people. And it's insane. It's the opposite. It's the Democrats using
[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.760]  race to control everybody.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.240]  And it's it's effective with the uninformed and the incurious. They fall for this with
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.080]  the Hispanic population in America. They only watch Univision. They don't have a Fox News.
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:44.360]  So they all assume that Trump is a Nazi and everyone's going to die and get arrested if
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:48.760]  he wins and blacks will have to go back to Africa. It's a propaganda machine. And you
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.840]  see how effective those are with the BBC in Britain, the government controlled media,
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:58.960]  the CBC in Canada with government controlled media. America is totally unique outside of
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:05.440]  Univision, where we have independent media. We have info wars, censor dot TV, Joe Rogan
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.160]  to a certain extent, though he gets censored. And that's a privilege that we should all
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.320]  enjoy. And it's something we should be willing to fight to the death for free speech defines
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:21.400]  America. And the deep state hates that because they're all about misinformation and manipulation.
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.880]  So getting involved in info wars and getting involved in these independent media is the
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:31.600]  only way to stay out of the matrix. It's the only way to stay alive, really.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:34.520]  It's precious. I want to come back because I forgot to play this clip. I should have
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:41.160]  led the show with this. Biden pulled a swallow as well. He said we'll use we'll use F 15s
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:45.920]  on Americans. Fighter bombers against the American people with gab McGinnis when we
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:51.160]  come back censor dot TV, we're with conspiracy fact dot info. That's the URL to share to
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:58.720]  get around the sensors. Do it now. As far as the fact dot info you want to beat the
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:03.980]  new world order, you want to stop their globalist agenda? Well, so do I. And I've been the most
[02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:08.360]  affected individual in the fight against the globalist and I've got their number and I
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:14.360]  know how to bring them down. Ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support. And the
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.640]  good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month. The bad news is the enemy is intensifying
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:24.120]  their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up,
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:28.160]  but I could give out. So please keep me on the field. Keep me on the front lines against
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:31.440]  the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:36.120]  family info wars store dot com for the best supplements and more or just make a straight
[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:40.440]  donation. Big red man at the top of info wars store dot com. And that way all the money
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:44.360]  goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost. But I thank you all
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:48.640]  for your support. Please commit now to go to info wars store dot com, get great products
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:52.840]  and make donations. I think if your support now take action, the globalist are counting
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:59.560]  on you not taking action.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:06.960]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:12.120]  the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world. We are engaging the
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:18.000]  globalist at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes,
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.320]  I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you've
[02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:29.040]  had the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:36.480]  you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.040]  it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:45.200]  continue the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:50.600]  I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:55.440]  are over the target and history is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:59.120]  our fight. God bless you all.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place. I want to encourage
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:09.800]  you all to go to infowarstore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong,
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:16.120]  high quality formula. Gallon out, sleep support, liquid, is very fast acting, taken out of
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:22.720]  the tongue. It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passion flower, valerian root extract,
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:28.040]  lemon balm, and German chamomile. All of these compounds are documented on record to help
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.240]  give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep. And that is one of the biggest game changers
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:37.400]  out there with all the stress we have in this world. And we've got some other great sleep
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.800]  eggs as well, and they're excellent. They're all different formulas. But this one is particularly
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:47.480]  the strongest one we have. So, Gallon out, sold out for more than five months. Now back
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:54.080]  available at infowarstore.com. So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:19:00.000]  support the info war with Gallon out, sleep support and info war store. I talk a lot
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.040]  about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it. And it
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:10.480]  is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew at info wars,
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:16.320]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs
[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:21.040]  in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:27.320]  in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself,
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:31.120]  the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:36.520]  to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread
[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:40.240]  the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:44.840]  and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:49.320]  and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:53.760]  our listeners actually go buy products in infowarstore.com. If just 1% more of you took
[02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:57.840]  action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:59.840]  now.
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:13.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Well, right
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:18.400]  in the middle of the special marathon broadcast going live until midnight tonight. I'm going
[02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:22.000]  to host past two o'clock and then take off a few hours, take care of operations here
[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.880]  and I'll be back around seven o'clock tonight with this whole raft of incredible gas and
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:33.120]  they've been amazing. Gavin McGinnis is our guest right now. Gavin, Biden, they're clearly
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:37.080]  getting ready to get rid of him. They've ignored all his crimes until now. I want to get your
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:40.720]  take on that and who you think they're going to try to bring in now or what you think it's
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.960]  about to unfold. But first, here's the clip. Biden threatens conservatives at MLK breakfast.
[02:20:45.960 --> 02:20:51.800]  If you want to take on the federal government, you need some F-15s. You don't need AR-15s.
[02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:55.560]  They keep saying Republicans want to be violent. When all the numbers show we're winning the
[02:20:55.560 --> 02:21:00.840]  culture war, they're having to steal elections to block that. And so they're clearly telegraphing.
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:05.200]  They're going to false flag or wind up some crazy people or bare minimum, let something
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:10.760]  happen. We've seen a long history of that. But this is like Swallowswell saying, we're
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:14.800]  going to take your guns and if you fight back, we'll use nukes. Well, nukes hit whole cities
[02:21:14.800 --> 02:21:19.080]  and whole armies, including their people. You don't take guns from someone dropping nukes
[02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:23.040]  on them unless you want to kill your own people. So just all the military methodology is so
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:29.200]  wrong as well. Here's the latest clip of the president threatening the American people
[02:21:29.200 --> 02:21:32.200]  with our armed services, which is called treason. Here it is.
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:40.120]  And ban the number of bullets in going to magazine. There's no, no need for any of that.
[02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:44.200]  I love my right-wing friends who talk about the tree of liberty is water with a blood
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:49.280]  of patriots. Give me a few need to work about taking on the federal government. You need
[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:56.520]  some F-15s. You don't need an AR-15. I'm serious. Think about it.
[02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:00.080]  By the way, I've studied warfare as I've studied history and I don't want any offensive stuff,
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:06.800]  but you just go to their houses. You don't go there and fight the F-15s. I mean, if the
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:09.400]  thing actually kicks off with the communists and they're coming after all of us in our
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:14.760]  houses, it'll be the other shoe on the other foot. We don't want any of that, but Bozo,
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:19.920]  the right-wing knows how to use guns and knows about asymmetrical warfare, dumbass. So if
[02:22:19.920 --> 02:22:23.520]  we want a physical fight, we'll win it, but that's not what we're doing. The capital
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:27.880]  was your provocateurs. It wasn't us. Gavin, you want to respond to his wet dream of a
[02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:32.520]  physical war with the American people? Well, I'm glad you brought up the capital because
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:37.960]  he just contradicted all of these lawsuits. He just said the government is this massive
[02:22:37.960 --> 02:22:42.680]  monolith, this big beast that you could never touch unless you had the most powerful fighter
[02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:48.240]  jets in the world. It's untouchable, right? It's Goliath. Okay, then why are all my friends
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:55.040]  in jail for daring to trespass on the capital grounds, unarmed, meander around, pick up a
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:23:00.680]  podium and walk out? Why did you throw them in prison? They're facing 25 years for that.
[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:06.680]  If you are such a powerful, unbreakable force, that's one point. Secondly, we're not, we're
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:11.080]  not getting guns so we can take over the government and kill the president, start our own, have
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:16.560]  another 1776. We are staying armed so you don't take advantage of us on a very micro
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:21.000]  level. Like look at the Bundy Ranch. They came there. They're going to kick out the
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:25.920]  building police. We got to defend ourselves. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, yeah. We, the police
[02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:31.280]  are spending an hour at least to get to these calls because you've castrated them. So we
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:34.760]  need to defend ourselves. But at the Bundy Ranch, what happened? The National Guard,
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:39.160]  the Army, the police all showed up. Everyone there was armed and Obama went, I don't want
[02:23:39.160 --> 02:23:43.880]  this to turn into a bloodbath. Give the Bundy's their land. Let's call the whole thing off.
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:49.320]  That's what we want guns for. Small standoffs. We don't want to plow through the entire government
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:54.040]  and fight. You said it. We want, we don't want violence. We want separation of powers,
[02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:58.840]  equal powers between the people, the states and the federal government. We want balance.
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:03.960]  We want standoffs, not violence. That's what, that's what liberty is, is a balance of power,
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:07.920]  which is a standoff. That's how a Roman arts works. They can't even make them as well as
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:14.840]  a Roman today. All those giant stones perfectly balanced together is invincible. Yeah, people
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:22.680]  are, the state is much less likely to bully an armed individual. The whole idea of half
[02:24:22.680 --> 02:24:26.600]  the country getting up and starting a war with the government grow up. This is like
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:31.880]  how 13 year olds talk. Joe Biden has a brain of a 13 year old. And that's why, by the way,
[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:35.440]  they're putting him out to pasture. Like it doesn't make any sense that his own people
[02:24:35.440 --> 02:24:39.880]  found classified documents and made it public. This guy stole the election. He doesn't play
[02:24:39.880 --> 02:24:44.960]  by the book. So his own people must be sending him out to sea because although he's always
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:49.240]  been a puppet, I don't think the puppet works anymore. Well, the word is, I was told this
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:53.920]  by Secret Service and I'm going to leave it at that and police. Biden, when he gets mad,
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:57.040]  craps himself. That's why he won't let Secret Service around him now because they know that
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:01.360]  leaked to us. It's I'm serious. I swear on my children. I was told by Secret Service
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:05.640]  and police that he literally gets mad at his staff, craps himself and then makes them
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.760]  clean him. That's why he famously said, I just got my butt wiped when he walked out to the
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:16.120]  press conference. He likes making him clean crap off his ass. But there's a name of that
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:23.800]  in royalty in French and British. It's called the groom of the stool. Oh my Lord. Well,
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:28.200]  he did it in the Vatican, right? He did it right in front of the Pope. That's right.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:34.640]  He's crapped himself in front of the Pope. Okay, I think it's time to go, Joe. I think
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:40.240]  it's time to go. If he was a local at my bar, I would feel like I was a super nice guy for
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:44.720]  sitting and talking to him over a beer. I had a family member I totally loved. I'm not
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:48.680]  going to get personal and talk about it. They were the wonderful smartest person I ever knew.
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:52.280]  And when they got about 80 something and had a stroke later when they got mad, they crap
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:58.480]  and rub crap on the walls and he's almost to that stage. So what do you think is what
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:05.320]  do you think is going to happen in 2024 Kamala and Gavin Newsom? Yeah, what? I agree. I think
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:08.320]  Kamala Gavin Newsom is the really smart pick. Everybody else goes, no, it's going to be
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:13.440]  big Mike. It's going to be Michelle Obama. What do you think about that? I think she
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.840]  has too many skeletons in her closet. I don't think that's real. I think it's gathered
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:24.560]  some Kamala Harris. But it amazes me because, you know, here on the right, we all assumed
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:29.160]  everyone knew that Gavin Newsom was a demon and he was totally ruined and he was almost
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:34.440]  recalled. I mean, it was his career was done. But the left, the information is controlled
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.880]  so well. They don't even know that Federman is special needs. Like they, you know, when
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:45.720]  Federman went, the Eagles are way better than the Eagles. And he was better than, you know,
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.560]  when he got, he did a photo op only once when he got sworn in, couldn't talk, had to be
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:58.520]  led by his wife, doesn't even know who he is. Talk to a liberal in Madison, Wisconsin,
[02:26:58.520 --> 02:27:02.440]  show her these Federman clips and she will have never seen them before. They think he's
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:07.200]  a great guy who's pro choice and pro union and totally has his head screwed on. Great.
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:12.280]  So Gavin Newsom, also a wonderful dude, Eric Swalwell. He had no dalliances with Fang
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:17.600]  Fang. That's been disproven. He's a wonderful guy too. Like you're dealing with people who
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:21.080]  have been fed lies. It's like trying to get someone out of a cult. I was listening to
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:25.320]  PR the other day by accident, going through the dial. And it was like a snake was going,
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:28.600]  black people are the biggest group not taking the shot, though it's totally effective and
[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:32.840]  works great because they're scared of Tuskegee. They brought a black lady on to go, trust
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:37.080]  us now. We promise we're not testing on you when they admit it was all an experiment.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.680]  And I'm listening. It's like satire. It's like, but, but they believe it all because
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:44.520]  they're in a trance.
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:50.080]  Tuskegee is another stupid myth where the, we gave them syphilis. No, they had syphilis.
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:56.480]  It was beyond repair. They were in the final stages and they were observed. Like this, almost
[02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:01.040]  everything that the left uses to prove that we live in a horrible place, like they burned
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:05.200]  down black Wall Street. No, black dude started a race riot and things got totally out of
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:12.200]  control. Every single story is a lie. George Floyd, all of it. And then they hide when
[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:15.760]  there's a, you know, black on white balance. And the next thing you know, they've created
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:20.000]  this animosity. Cause so black people are told that police are hunting them for sport. If
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.140]  I was told that from birth, that police are hunting me for sport, I'd want to kill cops.
[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:31.000]  So you put cops lies in general in danger. I think like 650 Philadelphia police were shot
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.160]  last year. I'll have to double check that figure.
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:38.200]  Most half of her black and they don't want to go to the areas down. The crime goes up.

[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:18.720]  private. In 2007, Alex Jones releases end game, exposing the world elites plans for
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:25.000]  covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched
[02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:32.200]  their attack in 2020, Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were there to warn the people

[02:33:17.120 --> 02:33:35.240]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas. Well, it's somebody that never gives up. He's
[02:33:35.240 --> 02:33:39.400]  had a raft of people that I really admire and love and I've been trying to get around
[02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:44.960]  for months. So today's the one they should come on for 30 for 30 minutes. But this lady
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:49.200]  has gone through hell to expose Fauci and all the crimes he was committing and gain a function
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:54.520]  he was involved in beyond that cancer viruses in the vaccine that I read about they knew
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:58.600]  about the 30s 40s 50s and 60s but she discovered it while she was there watched it happening
[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:02.320]  and learned that so much the cancer increase was from that and they literally came after
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:08.000]  her with the deep state. It's in the film obviously pandemic and so out of all the great
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.640]  doctors and all the great scientists have come forward to expose the current tyranny
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:17.280]  the last three years she's been the original gangster as they'd say the OG who was there
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:22.320]  decades ago exposing this and they swat teamed her and set her up and put her in prison ladies
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:27.480]  and gentlemen but she's been totally vindicated. She's an amazing lady and I just wanted to
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:34.360]  get her on with an update on what it's like to be vindicated. She was on with us two years
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:39.920]  ago and all of this again like six months ago hard to get and one of the most popular
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.320]  guests to please come to town we'd fly here we love to have to do a two three hour presentation
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.560]  you do a PowerPoint you can host a show and she she laid out everything that it's going
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:53.760]  to cause blood clots cancer it's going to kill you it's going to raise your immune system
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:59.200]  all of that confirmed it's now all coming out and she'd been screaming since day one
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:02.080]  before they even announced the vaccine they were going to do this because she worked for
[02:35:02.080 --> 02:35:07.280]  Fauci and she knows and this guy is literally Dr. Ebel for real so I'm not going to go over
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:11.120]  her medical degrees and her background and all the things she's done is it would take
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:17.080]  the 25 minutes we have the real Dr. Judy dot com the real Dr. Judy dot com it's not about
[02:35:17.080 --> 02:35:21.040]  being vindicated but it's also good to be vindicated because it means more people will
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:26.560]  listen and we can save lives but just to give us an idea from your incredible perspective
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:30.640]  that others don't have being an insider that saw what was happening and spoke up where
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:34.240]  would you call the moment we're at because even as the board members of the FDA come
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:37.520]  out and say we were lied to it's dangerous pull it and the British Medical Board say
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:41.600]  pull it they're at Debo saying since there anybody that questions it they're back to
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.080]  saying safe and effective 100% protection I mean this is a weird moment but their body
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:50.760]  languages are really freaked out half the attendees cancelled we know they're quarterbacking
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.520]  it for the UN and the globalist and so even Drudge report says they're in battle they're
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:36:00.360]  falling apart I don't just believe mainstream media I think that's true but why is mainstream
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:04.960]  media now admitting this is happening and cloth swabs begging for trust again I mean
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:10.040]  wow do they not know what they were about to pull this wasn't AZT and killing a few
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.600]  million people with a poison drug back in the 80s they're gone after billions of people
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:21.400]  Dr. Judy Mike of it's thank you so much and we salute you all we salute you so much thank
[02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:27.480]  you so much Alex and yeah it was last in your studio September 25th and and the great
[02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:35.040]  news is where we are now because of you know we knew I was right there with the first gain
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:43.360]  of function vaccine aids which was HIV so HIV and a vaccine program for the hepatitis
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:53.520]  B vaccine drove the disease in and we know AZT in people who were antibody positive drove
[02:36:53.520 --> 02:36:59.080]  antibody dependent enhancement so the great news is we cured AIDS then with an approach
[02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:05.160]  that was systems biology bring all hands on deck and so you don't hear about it anymore
[02:37:05.160 --> 02:37:13.040]  do you so we have highly active antiretroviral therapies that are actually oral vaccination
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.480]  strategies and we do two hours with you you're a legend just on that you're so incredible
[02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:22.600]  that's why they got so mad at you encapsulate who Fauci is where we currently are and what
[02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:28.880]  you think these criminals are going to do now that they're cornered well we know he's
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:36.960]  and in fact I worked for him only in that he funded my small business grants at epigenics
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:46.200]  pharmaceuticals and in 2001 through five the R01 the institutional grant for our neuro
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:53.120]  immune institute which actually found that these viruses the spike protein the components
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:38:00.360]  the contaminants were driving neuroimmune disease like autism and me CFS so the answer
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:06.200]  this I set up the program the same way we did in 1983 at the in the National Cancer
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:13.320]  Institute and simply in five short years found the cytokine storm found the variant associated
[02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:19.920]  with CFS found the variant associated with cardiovascular disease found the susceptibility
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:28.080]  low side that we now appreciate the the SCN five that's a channel a sodium channel that's
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:35.400]  really important in cardiology SCN four is in brain diseases so yeah for Tony Fauci is
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:42.880]  the funder he's the person who decides what goes in fraudulent journals like our the science
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:49.240]  the journal science he's the one that sets up and writes opinion papers to tell the scientists
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:55.520]  and the doctors what to think which are is often a lie in and this was the case with
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:39:01.960]  our 2009 science paper but we pulled these variants we pulled Omicron from people and
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:07.280]  they were silent disease but we saw these kids dropping dead on athletic fields from
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:13.200]  the Gardasil vaccine with a similar lipid nanoparticle so who he is is the gatekeeper
[02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:19.480]  controls billions of dollars in funding can keep your grants can keep you from publishing
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.360]  and in fact the simple thing we've done is is the same way we did before create an entire
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:32.640]  get healthy store healthy for your brain with books like your book like our books plague
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:38.640]  of corruption the real Anthony Fauci to tell the truth because censorship and the corruption
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.320]  of the scientific literature is what happened to our doctors so we're delighted to have
[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:51.160]  now global tech md.com where people can get a real human get an answer Peter McCullough
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:58.400]  I know Mike Adams is involved so we're just going to put clean food clean solutions healthy
[02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:04.960]  the the way we cured and I'm going to say cured HIV AIDS because HIV never did cause
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:14.920]  our infections it was all infection by injection and so all we have to do right now is stop
[02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:21.200]  all the shots we've got a class there on the real doctor Judy dot com that starts up tonight
[02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:29.840]  live it's nine hours of me and dr. Tracy Straub showing you all the contaminants over the vaccine
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.640]  program how that's not just the covers let me ask you this question if the CDC said in
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:38.200]  October it caused blood clots and brain damage why would they put that out but still do it
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:43.000]  everything you said come true now all these top people are coming out agreeing with you
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:46.240]  why did they think they could get away with it or are they going to get away with it how
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:51.920]  do they get away with this well they got away with it and this was Tony Fauci's you know
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:59.840]  crime this is literally premeditated murder of between 40 and 50 million Americans who
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:07.120]  were injected with HIV in our military Robert Redfield and Deborah Birx and we know that
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:13.840]  because we detected the HIV it's called PNL for theory it's a synthetic virus a plasmid
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:20.160]  that makes virus we detected that in the military that were associated with PTSD so we know
[02:41:20.160 --> 02:41:25.800]  Fauci's been doing this all along and we simply we simply have the solutions and so why do
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:29.560]  they do that like you spike an old cannon they want to give a disease to troops when
[02:41:29.560 --> 02:41:34.400]  they're so that they develop in a few years later once they're out why do they do that
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:40.120]  correct you're going to see so they do it because in in 1986 when all liability was
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:47.640]  removed if there was a design flaw in the vaccine and you could make a vaccine safer
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:55.160]  and you didn't do so all liability was off in 2009 our paper in science proved there
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:03.720]  were many of these spike proteins of contaminating animal viruses and oh so they flooded the
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:11.600]  zone with spike proteins to cover up all the past crime correct ah they've been injecting
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:20.840]  SARS-CoV-2 in every polio shot since they manufactured it first in 2004 that's a paper
[02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:26.080]  buy more at all in journal of our ology so this is what we always do we caught them we
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:32.440]  caught that while bombing at a national initiative in the mid 2013 40 15 of universities testing
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.280]  spike protein vaccines on rats and then the conclusion was don't give it to humans why
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:43.360]  were they studying that um correct because you needed an antidote and you needed to understand
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:49.160]  antibody dependent enhancement you needed to understand how to activate past dormant
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:54.320]  viruses can call dr. Judy stay there this is incredible you're talking above our heads
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:21.080]  but it's okay it's on record we'll be right back

[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:42.120]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:44.120]  A book of Revelation.
[02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:58.120]  Very serious times to be alive folks. They're not just doing this as a one off. This is the beginning of the rest of our lives. This is our fight. And I'm proud of humanity. The globalists even admit it's leaked. They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:14.120]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in mice famously said more than 150 years ago rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:24.120]  And it's the same psyop today. Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.

[02:47:52.120 --> 02:48:01.120]  Dr. Judy Mikovits, I want to ask you as the biggest whistleblower out there for decades.
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:08.120]  In layman's terms, you're rattling off for doctors and scientists. All the key stuff has been proven. It's incredible groundbreaking. Each thing you say we do an hour on.
[02:48:08.120 --> 02:48:20.120]  But big picture. What do you make of all the scientists and doctors coming out by the thousands and it all over mainstream news that they knew it would cause heart attacks and cover it up and why would they do that and blood clots and all the rest of this.
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:30.120]  What's really going on? I don't think they thought it would come out this big. Why did they do it? You were already explaining their mad scientist, but just just your overall 35,000 foot view.
[02:48:30.120 --> 02:48:40.120]  If you were like talking to your grandkids and you were talking to high school students or college people, just the general stuff, not all the science which you're an expert at. Who are these people?
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  Are they just like Jeffrey Dahmer? Why do you kidnap people and torture them to death because you like to do it? I mean, why are they doing this?
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:49:05.120]  Well, they're really doing it because over four decades, they realized that the shots were causing the explosion of chronic disease, asthma, neuroimmune diseases like psychosis, ADHD, autism, cancer, cancer, cancer, autoimmune diseases.
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:19.120]  So they realized in 2011, they caused it all. So we're in 2009 and when our paper came out, they realized that these shots were associated strongly, very strongly.
[02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:27.120]  The chance of them not being associated was like being struck by lightning, one in at least a million in a p-value.
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:48.120]  And so they covered this all up because, of course, they were liable now because for the 42 million Americans who are asymptomatic carriers of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 and other XMRVs, other manufactured mouse monkey and human viruses.
[02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:52.120]  So they've been injecting animal tissues, aborted fetal tissues.
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:50:01.120]  But why would they release something even worse? You're seeing an attempt to flood the zone with disinformation and now making about this shot for liability protection from all the others?
[02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  Or do they think it would protect them from all the viruses that already had spike protein that they'd given us?
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:15.120]  Oh, no, absolutely. The game was premeditated murder of the 42 million people who are liable for their injury.
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  Premeditated murder. If you give somebody who already has an antibody a shot, you will get antibody-dependent enhancement.
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  Oh, so they were getting rid of the people they'd already poisoned knowing that giving them a second or third or fourth dose would kill them. Wow.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:36.120]  Correct. Call it cancer, target population.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:42.120]  Doctor, talk to me like I'm five years old because I'm not a top scientist like you. I've studied it. I've tried to get my mind around it. Everything makes sense.
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:46.120]  They've already complained to me. Wow. So they'd already poisoned us. They knew studies were coming out about that.
[02:50:46.120 --> 02:50:54.120]  So they bomb it with this new thing, get government liability, emergency authorization to claim it's that to cover up everything else. Is that what you're saying?
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:51:06.120]  Yeah, kill us, cremate us, add a mask, add a mask and isolation, and you'll blame the people for COPD or any of the other co-diseases.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:19.120]  You never inject an HIV positive person with any vaccine. We never did. Never until now. You do not drive the disease-causing entity through their body.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:28.120]  Why do we know that all over the world, the people that have had the COPD vaccine are testing positive for HIV? Is that because the spike proteins from HIV?
[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:41.120]  It has GP120, glycoprotein 120. Absolutely. It also has the monkey mouse and manufactured as XMRV. I hope you have Dr. Jim Thorpe on someday. He'll show you.
[02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:43.120]  Give me his number. We'll have him on right now.
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:55.120]  He alone shows you how it causes abortion. I'll get it to Daria. So this is what we knew. And then you make it infectious with the ACE receptor 2 binding domain.
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:52:01.120]  So the spike protein is killing literally the 12%.
[02:52:01.120 --> 02:52:07.120]  So you're saying it's a binary weapon where they already are pre-loaded with it and this triggers the next phase?
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:10.120]  Correct.
[02:52:10.120 --> 02:52:25.120]  And the more vaccines you got, especially Gardasil, because that has the toxic synthetic lipid nanoparticles similar to the one in the COVID shot. Prior to the COVID shot, the deadliest vaccine.
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:30.120]  We saw athletes dropping dead on the field, passing out, falling down all the things.
[02:52:30.120 --> 02:52:34.120]  Why is it particularly the athletes?
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:48.120]  Because they operate at oxygen max capacity max. They're operating at such a high level in their mitochondria. This is an energy production, oxygen necessary disease.
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:52.120]  So that's what they're finding. They turbo charge the blood clots.
[02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:54.120]  Correct.
[02:52:54.120 --> 02:53:05.120]  And a lack of oxygen. So constricted blood vessels too, because athletes are running, they're constricted, they're working so that the blood flows and it doesn't flow.
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:14.120]  Which is why your nitric oxide product, that new product. I hope you'll show it because that's a very important thing to have for acute events.
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:21.120]  It does all under the tongue, give you an instant relaxing of your endothelium, your vasculature.
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:26.120]  That's another big question. What should people do that have long cobs that have been infested and colonized by spike protein?
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:33.120]  I've talked to other doctors, they say ivermectin, they say lots of water, they say steaming, they say hydroxychloroquine, lots of vitamin D3.
[02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:41.120]  But they also say you should take nitric oxide boosting compounds, an aspirin. Is that accurate?
[02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:51.120]  Yes, but I don't like the an aspirin. I use cardiomiracle, which teaches you to make your own, it's your immune system, it's the amino acids.
[02:53:51.120 --> 02:54:03.120]  So you make your own nitric oxide, as God intended. I also use proline greens, a product that has algae and various spirulina and chlorella.
[02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:12.120]  And milk thistle, that's how we detox age. Sure, so you looked at our nitric oxide, I saw it was the top rated, they let us private label it, it's the best seller.
[02:54:12.120 --> 02:54:17.120]  You've looked at our formula, you like it? I did, and I do, yes.
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:23.120]  I'm not a scientist like you, what do these compounds do creating nitric oxide, what does it do?
[02:54:23.120 --> 02:54:31.120]  It relaxes the vasculature, so the clot will go through and not restrict. It allows it to relax, it lowers the blood pressure.
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:41.120]  You don't need aspirin if you do, you can just get salicylic acid from plants and our own long chain, sorry, I won't get scientific.
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:56.120]  At any rate, I should say starting tonight, we're teaching a seven hour and a half class for doctors, for anyone to detox the jab on the Odom platform, and it's right there at the real Dr. Judy.
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:55:05.120]  Wow, so I asked that question, you just so happen to be doing a big seminar tonight, again, say it slowly, this is so important, everybody should tune in, when does it start?
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:19.120]  Okay, it starts at seven o'clock Eastern time, and we'll be with Dr. Tracy Stroud, we did the class, when I left you on September 25th, we realized we needed to do this last year.
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:31.120]  So we set the whole thing up, got the products on the classroom, so we're teaching doctors and individuals, in nine hours I go through excruciating detail of everything I usually write.
[02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:39.120]  Well that was my next question, if the globalists release something like that, they say it can shed, is that true A and B, what are they doing to protect themselves?
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:47.120]  They're doing what we'll show you tonight, they're doing various bombs with copper and micron silver, they wouldn't ever wear a mask.
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:56:06.120]  They're using pure energetic modulators, like you mentioned, ivermectin, there are specific things you can use for specific tissue compartments, like if you have a gastrointestinal tract, if you're not making antibodies, if you have lupus and you're making autoantibodies,
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:20.120]  we'd add different type 1 interferon products, so we know how we cured AIDS, and so this is why we're the opportunity with the thousands of doctors now, and patients who can just walk away from the course.
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:25.120]  So the same guy that brought us HIV, AIDS, hit us again, and it's basically the same treatment.
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  It's vaccine AIDS, and yes, it's basically the same protocols, we tailor them for the individual, because a black person cannot take liquid vitamin D, the sensors on their cells will turn it off.
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:47.120]  Cardiomiracle helps you make vitamin D, when you make good nitric oxide, you can make vitamin D from someone else.
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:50.120]  Is that why black people have double the rate of COVID death because of the vitamin D?
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:52.120]  Correct.
[02:56:52.120 --> 02:56:57.120]  And where's the NAACP telling them when all the studies are there?
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:08.120]  Well, we're telling them, and we always have, with Kevin Jenkins' film Medical Racism that first aired at chd.org on Children's Health Defense on March 10, 2021.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:20.120]  So we can see the medical racism, we've appreciated it for my entire 40-year career, and we don't just show you causes, we show you solutions, diagnostics.
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:27.120]  You can look at your genetic susceptibilities, all through GlobalTechMD, a program.
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:33.120]  We're going to get discount, we're going to offer the victims of this plague of corruption.
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:40.120]  We are going to take those nurses who were injured in those clinical trials and invite them, like Olivia's story.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:42.120]  Stay there, do five more minutes for this.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:45.120]  You've got to promise to come back the next few weeks or an hour, though.
[02:57:45.120 --> 02:57:48.120]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:53.120]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:58.120]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:03.120]  And InfoWars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[02:58:03.120 --> 02:58:08.120]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:17.120]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you make to freedom.
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:23.120]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena,
[02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:30.120]  we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:39.120]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:45.120]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain.
[02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:48.120]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[02:58:48.120 --> 02:58:53.120]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[02:58:53.120 --> 02:58:57.120]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:05.120]  But all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:08.120]  These are high-end. These are the very best.
[02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:10.120]  You know our body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing?
[02:59:10.120 --> 02:59:16.120]  Well, guess what? We now have Tumurik 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:26.120]  CBD oil of the highest quality, up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[02:59:26.120 --> 02:59:31.120]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:31.120 --> 02:59:41.120]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:59:41.120 --> 03:00:05.120]  InfoWars MD at infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:23.120]  Judy, I really appreciate you joining us.
[03:00:23.120 --> 03:00:27.120]  I'm going to hit a ton of news coming up next segment that we haven't gotten to and then go to our next guest.
[03:00:27.120 --> 03:00:31.120]  But in layman's terms, though, what do you make?
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:33.120]  I asked this earlier and you kind of went into all the science.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:36.120]  But of all of the news coming out, they poisoned this.
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:39.120]  All the science coming out, the world learning, it doesn't protect you.
[03:00:39.120 --> 03:00:43.120]  They're in panic mode at the Davos Group for real.
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:48.120]  What do you make of that and what do you expect them to do next knowing these scumbags?
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.120]  Well, I expect them to continue the game.
[03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:57.120]  But the good news of giving us the booster or the booster, we now know they tell us there's a new enterovirus.
[03:00:57.120 --> 03:01:00.120]  That's a polio virus folks coming out.
[03:01:00.120 --> 03:01:05.120]  But we know that virus has been in the polio shot driving in many of these shots.
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  It's called Enterovirus 71.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:09.120]  We know how to heal it.
[03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:11.120]  The thing, I don't care what they do.
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:13.120]  What we're going to do is say, no, thank you.
[03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:17.120]  We're going to move on and we're going to heal ourselves and let their...
[03:01:17.120 --> 03:01:21.120]  And that's why they got so mad and tried to block therapeutics that have come out on the Twitter files.
[03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:29.120]  The military, new hydroxychloroquine and the other products were basically 100% effective.
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:35.120]  They knew Ivermectin was what, 12, 14 years ago, in a Pentagon study and they suppressed it.
[03:01:35.120 --> 03:01:40.120]  Correct. So what they're trying to do now is make you think it was only the COVID shot.
[03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:42.120]  And it stopped all the shots.
[03:01:42.120 --> 03:01:44.120]  As I told you, they set you up.
[03:01:44.120 --> 03:01:45.120]  That's what they're afraid of.
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:46.120]  They want everybody.
[03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:50.120]  That's why they're coming to tell everybody, oh, yeah, we may just make, oh, yeah, we made a mistake.
[03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:51.120]  Oh, we'll fix it next time.
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:54.120]  Well, you know, no, we no more next times.
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  You've done it to us for 40 years.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:57.120]  Thank you very much.
[03:01:57.120 --> 03:02:00.120]  We can save anyone.
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:13.120]  Let me correct you. You're the scientist, my grandmother on her second round of polio in Austin, Texas in the mid 1950s was told by her doctor and apologized and said, yeah, we had a bad batch full of this virus.
[03:02:13.120 --> 03:02:15.120]  It made you get polio.
[03:02:15.120 --> 03:02:19.120]  And she lived in 92, but was in pain and lost a lot of her muscles and nerves, as you know.
[03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:26.120]  But she was told in the mid 50s by her doctor, but the second round of polio shot basically had live polio in it and gave her polio.
[03:02:26.120 --> 03:02:31.120]  So it's, I think it's, I mean, this is, this is like, that's like 70 years almost.
[03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:33.120]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct.
[03:02:33.120 --> 03:02:42.120]  In fact, in our book, we show 1934, 1934, chapter five of our book plague, our first book plague.
[03:02:42.120 --> 03:02:45.120]  That's in our Get Healthy Store on the real Dr. Judy.
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:49.120]  We'll donate anything people buy from our store today.
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  We'll make sure you get half of everything we take for that.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:02:57.120]  Oh, you're a sweetheart. Everybody needs this information. How do they get it?
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:02:59.120]  The real Dr. Judy.com.
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:04.120]  We'll start teaching the class tonight at seven o'clock detox from the jabs.
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:08.120]  And we will have a self-paced class again.
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:13.120]  Any time you take the class, we'll get, we'll donate it to you today.
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:19.120]  Isn't that incredible though that Benny Hammond, my grandmother, was told by her doctor and she forgave him.
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:27.120]  And he said, he admitted to her. He said, sorry, a bunch of our staff that took this and everybody's getting polio.
[03:03:27.120 --> 03:03:32.120]  And we're sorry, they didn't know. And they gave my grandmother polio.
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:37.120]  They did know. And it was in the, it's in the, it's in the shot.
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:45.120]  It's in the foreword of Bobby Kennedy's brilliant foreword of our book, Plague of Corruption, which came out April 14, 2020.
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.120]  That's what the, that's the book that, um, pandemic was based on.
[03:03:50.120 --> 03:03:53.120]  Is it Robert Kennedy, Jr. a hero?
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:56.120]  He is. And I think today's his birthday. So maybe a shout out.
[03:03:56.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  All right. Well, thank you so much. Promise me. I know you're a busy lady, but please come back to studio or come back anytime.
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:06.120]  I will. I will, Alex.
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:11.120]  Again, one more time, the website and the best books for people to protect themselves right now. Everybody needs this.
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:13.120]  The website again.
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:18.120]  The real Dr. Judy.com. You can buy all the books there, even yours.
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:24.120]  Get healthy. Get healthy in your brain. Don't support Amazon. Support Alex.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  Well, I'm, I thank you for the support. We really need it. Thank you, doctor.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:29.120]  Thank you.
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:35.120]  Well, that lady is a hero and she is so dead on and she knows what she's talking about. And it's just incredible.
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:37.120]  Now it all makes sense.
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:43.120]  They had to cover up all the other stuff they knew was coming out with this new weapon to blame that because they got government liability protection.
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:48.120]  And they knew it would all come out in the spars report two years before they released it.
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:52.120]  That's all true. It all just, we just went next level. We just went next level.
[03:04:52.120 --> 03:05:08.120]  We'll be right back. Stay with us in 60 seconds.
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:37.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:52.120]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:18.120]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:06:18.120 --> 03:06:30.120]  Our next guest hail from Australia. She'll host for the rest of the hour and then we have Roger Stones of Anna Hernandez from the Davos group live on the ground.
[03:06:30.120 --> 03:06:37.120]  Darren Beatty, Matt Baker, Dan Dix, Tom Renz, Jay Dyer with the spars updated 730. That's going to be huge.
[03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:41.120]  Got new intel. It's over the top important. Edward Dowell with over the top importance.
[03:06:41.120 --> 03:06:48.120]  Mickey Willis in studio, Alex Dynard, Stella Emanuel, Robert Barnes and more. I'll be back.
[03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:54.120]  I'll be here at seven, but I'm just going to sit back and let those guys host because there's no need to interrupt.
[03:06:54.120 --> 03:06:55.120]  That's all coming up.
[03:06:55.120 --> 03:07:01.120]  I launched this fundraiser. I decided to do it about a week ago because we have some underages of a couple hundred thousand dollars a month.
[03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:03.120]  Not insurmountable. Thanks for your support.
[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:13.120]  So we built the new site conspiracy fact.com to get around the sensors to send people the live show feed to make sure you don't get censored for doing it or Alex was right.com.
[03:07:13.120 --> 03:07:23.120]  But I forgot the number one thing about a fundraiser is we've got an algorithm plug in that hooks into our shopping cart and people love to see the donations as they come in.
[03:07:23.120 --> 03:07:28.120]  I didn't have them do that and they didn't think to do it. Not their fault. My fault because I'm a boss.
[03:07:28.120 --> 03:07:35.120]  And once you started, it's kind of hard to recompute the info and put it in. It doesn't work right. I'm told. It's not accurate.
[03:07:35.120 --> 03:07:43.120]  So we're going to monkey around with that and see if we can get what's come in there and like start it from that number and add that number to it or something.
[03:07:43.120 --> 03:07:50.120]  But we don't. We haven't looked at the numbers at info or short.com. But it doesn't matter. I believe that you're going to support us. I need you. You need us.
[03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:58.120]  We are tireless. We are fearless. We are in this fight. But we can't do this and take on the New World War without your support.
[03:07:58.120 --> 03:08:04.120]  And you see the Nabos group saying anti globalist anti Nabos group talk show host or number one enemy.
[03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:11.120]  I got the clip right here of Klaus Schwab saying and I haven't played it guys. I got like 20 clips find that one where they say this information is number one threat.
[03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:15.120]  But it's all over the news. I can show you the headline right here.
[03:08:15.120 --> 03:08:23.120]  It's truth is their main threat. So this broadcast needs to stay on air and we're going to stay on air. We just need the funding.
[03:08:23.120 --> 03:08:28.120]  We have three to four years two to four years of appeals. They're not shutting us down like they said on the news.
[03:08:28.120 --> 03:08:34.120]  But if you decide we're done and believe their lies that a we have plenty of money which is a true or B you know we're going down.
[03:08:34.120 --> 03:08:40.120]  We will shut down because you believe their side. Do not believe their side. Go to info or short.com.

[03:10:26.120 --> 03:10:44.120]  Dot com ladies and gentlemen or triple eight two five three three one three nine and separately we have 1776 coin dot com we had the three introductory coins only $10,000 apiece there's a mark big markup on them just like MPR again.
[03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:56.120]  We'll have a t shirt or a sweater that cost them $10 for $100 it's just it's that you donated. So the coins cost us because of printing them at the highest quality and silver $35 or so.
[03:10:56.120 --> 03:11:04.120]  So we sell them, you know, for 100 bucks or so. That's a fundraiser that means you supported. You have that momentum.
[03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:15.120]  We're doing $30 off of promo code 1776 we got a few thousand the Teddy Roosevelt coins left at info or store.com and that's it for coins. And these are the end of the founding member coins.
[03:11:15.120 --> 03:11:32.120]  And finally, I'm about six to eight months behind all our projects but we're about to launch some of the really cool stuff for founding members and it's going to be things like, I'm going to start a commercial free at least weekly podcast with big guests analysis and power points.
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:42.120]  I'm going to do it for people every week. That is going to be on the subscription site. Everybody that's a founding member, you get a free membership, your membership email stuff like that.
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:50.120]  I'm going to do original art. I'm just behind. You're going to get that mailed in the mail. So there's things like that going on but I know you didn't sign up for that.
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:56.120]  You didn't do it for that. You wanted to support us but it's your last chance to get the coin if you want it because we're not doing coins for a long time.
[03:11:56.120 --> 03:12:02.120]  They won't be founding member coins. That's it. So the Teddy Roosevelt coin, man the arena, help keep us in the arena.
[03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:11.120]  infowarstore.com for all the supplements and the signed book as a fundraiser but for the coin, 1776coin.com.
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:16.120]  Here Dr. Mikovits talk about the nitric boost. How important that is. Now she loves the formula.
[03:12:16.120 --> 03:12:21.120]  That is so important for your cardiovascular system and how we're under attack not just from the shots but the spike protein.
[03:12:21.120 --> 03:12:30.120]  So infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com. Now I'll be back around 7 o'clock tonight. Oh and everybody's loaded for bear.
[03:12:30.120 --> 03:12:34.120]  Share the links. Promote the show. Get millions of new people to tune in. It's happening. It's very exciting.
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:43.120]  I salute the crew for the great job they've done and now taking over is Maria Z from Australia. Maria Z, thank you so much.
[03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:51.120]  Thank you Alex. It's a pleasure to be here on this emergency broadcast. What does Alex Jones was right actually mean?
[03:12:51.120 --> 03:13:00.120]  Well for the viewers of this broadcast, the regular viewers, you know that more often than not what Alex brings forward to you is life saving information.
[03:13:00.120 --> 03:13:11.120]  No one on this earth has done what info wars has done and for most of us in independent media, Alex, I mean Alex is the one that started this.
[03:13:11.120 --> 03:13:22.120]  Alex is the one that started exposing the globalist at the level that he has been doing for decades now and we are essentially following in his footsteps.
[03:13:22.120 --> 03:13:33.120]  Every single one of us that has an independent media channel that does this for work, we live and breathe this, but I don't know anyone that lives and breathes it like Alex.
[03:13:33.120 --> 03:13:46.120]  Who else is out here doing four hour broadcasts every single day nonstop bringing you the truth, bringing you the truth first.
[03:13:46.120 --> 03:13:53.120]  And many of us look up to Alex, you know, I've told this story before and I was very young.
[03:13:53.120 --> 03:14:03.120]  My dad told me about the New World Order. He showed me documentaries about September 11 and from there I started my journey in researching about the New World Order.
[03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:14.120]  I was very, very young and I recall in my teenage years watching documentaries that Alex produced learning about Bohemian Grove and learning about what was really happening in this world.
[03:14:14.120 --> 03:14:26.120]  Had I not learnt that at the age that I did, if Alex's content was not there in my early years, I wouldn't know what I know now.
[03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:37.120]  I wouldn't be able to expose what I do at the level that I do without that foundational setting that I had very, very early on in life and I'm grateful for it.
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:49.120]  Some people may think that, you know, this is too overwhelming for teenagers to learn about. I disagree because this is what set me on a straight path from my early years.
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:56.120]  It's what protected me from the corporate brainwashing within the organisations that I worked for.
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:02.120]  It's what protected me from the woke agenda that was creeping into the organisations that I worked for.
[03:15:02.120 --> 03:15:11.120]  I'm from a corporate background but I never complied with it and I was always able to withstand it because I understood the agenda behind it.
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:17.120]  Now some might say that you're able to figure that out on your own, okay, with what information?
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:22.120]  Where would we be without independent media?
[03:15:22.120 --> 03:15:30.120]  Where would we be without people exposing the truth about what is really happening in this world?
[03:15:30.120 --> 03:15:33.120]  What does the mainstream media have to offer us?
[03:15:33.120 --> 03:15:40.120]  Just rints and repeat and virtue signalling about saving the world?
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:46.120]  We'll talk about that a little bit in a moment and I've got special guest Bobby Source joining us at 230 Central.
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:52.120]  He's an amazing guy, an amazing analyst, comedian and you'll really, really enjoy what he has to say.
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:56.120]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:15:56.120 --> 03:16:06.120]  I want you to remember two words, InfoWars Platinum in the history of InfoWars supplements and they're amazing.
[03:16:06.120 --> 03:16:12.120]  This is hands down the most powerful game changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[03:16:12.120 --> 03:16:20.120]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements
[03:16:20.120 --> 03:16:26.120]  and the owners a listener and a supporter, so they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores,
[03:16:26.120 --> 03:16:32.120]  over 20% off what they're sold online under the InfoWars Platinum brand name.
[03:16:32.120 --> 03:16:40.120]  These are incredible. Pain MD, HGH Max Boost and of course 1776 testosterone boost.
[03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:47.120]  Read about them at infowarsstore.com, learn about them and then try them out for yourself and I know you will be a repeat customer,
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:53.120]  which is awesome, it will empower your life, make your life more amazing and it will keep us on the air a 360 win.
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:57.120]  InfoWars Platinum, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:16:57.120 --> 03:17:05.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy of my number one bestselling book,
[03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:12.120]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:17.120]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online, but if you want to get a historic signed copy
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:25.120]  and be part of our fundraiser to stay on air, go to infowarsstore.com and go to the book section and get your signed book.
[03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:29.120]  There are only about a thousand of these left and when they're gone, they're gone.
[03:17:29.120 --> 03:17:33.120]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[03:17:33.120 --> 03:17:37.120]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later, there's a piece of art that goes with the book,
[03:17:37.120 --> 03:17:42.120]  but I haven't even decided what I'm going to do that, it may never happen, but for just simple straight up sign books
[03:17:42.120 --> 03:17:49.120]  and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:54.120]  I thank you all for your support, please go to infowarsstore.com and get your signed book today,
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:57.120]  and I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[03:17:57.120 --> 03:18:00.120]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[03:18:00.120 --> 03:18:04.120]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life,
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:11.120]  but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source
[03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:16.120]  that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[03:18:16.120 --> 03:18:22.120]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.

[03:19:53.120 --> 03:19:55.120]  Thank you for your support.
[03:20:12.120 --> 03:20:17.120]  Welcome back. Alex Jones has sparked a movement and every single one of us should be grateful for that
[03:20:17.120 --> 03:20:21.120]  and give him credit for that as well as all of the other presenters on InfoWars.
[03:20:21.120 --> 03:20:24.120]  The wonderful team that make this broadcast possible.
[03:20:24.120 --> 03:20:29.120]  I don't know if people can really grasp the amount of work that goes into making this seamless for the audience
[03:20:29.120 --> 03:20:35.120]  so that you can get this crucial information into your minds and share it with the masses.
[03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:37.120]  That is the whole purpose of independent media.
[03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:42.120]  We are fighting the biggest fight that we have ever had in all of history.
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:47.120]  And you know what, people don't put anywhere near as much scrutiny on the mainstream media
[03:20:47.120 --> 03:20:49.120]  as they do on us in independent media.
[03:20:49.120 --> 03:20:57.120]  But we're here showing you the documents, showing you the words from the mouths of the people that seek to subdue you.
[03:20:57.120 --> 03:21:00.120]  And they just spout lies all the time.
[03:21:00.120 --> 03:21:06.120]  And I want people to just imagine what the world would look like if all you had was the mainstream media.
[03:21:06.120 --> 03:21:15.120]  Just imagine if all you had was the same parroting propaganda with no independent media,
[03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:17.120]  no truth coming out anywhere.
[03:21:17.120 --> 03:21:26.120]  George Orwell, just think about 1984 and think about if you had no one out there challenging what these people say.
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:28.120]  It would be literal hell on earth.
[03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:32.120]  Less people would be able to think for themselves.
[03:21:32.120 --> 03:21:35.120]  I guarantee you that.
[03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:41.120]  There would be even more gaslighting, even more ability for them to control the masses if there was a pushback.
[03:21:41.120 --> 03:21:44.120]  And we have heroes out there like Tucker Carlson.
[03:21:44.120 --> 03:21:46.120]  I don't know what your thoughts are on him, but God bless him.
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:50.120]  He does the best that he can in his position.
[03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:54.120]  And we are grateful for his voice in the darkness.
[03:21:54.120 --> 03:21:59.120]  Imagine if there was no one on Fox telling you the truth.
[03:21:59.120 --> 03:22:04.120]  This is a multi-faceted war, and Infowars has played a huge role in it.
[03:22:04.120 --> 03:22:06.120]  In fact, it is at the forefront of it.
[03:22:06.120 --> 03:22:10.120]  So I'm asking everyone who's tuning into this broadcast, support them.
[03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:12.120]  Go to theinfowarsstore.com.
[03:22:12.120 --> 03:22:14.120]  Go and purchase their products.
[03:22:14.120 --> 03:22:16.120]  Go and buy the coin, the Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:20.120]  It's a moment in history, and it's showing your support to Infowars.
[03:22:20.120 --> 03:22:25.120]  Because without this broadcast, all you would have is lies.
[03:22:25.120 --> 03:22:28.120]  But I think sometimes we take that for granted.
[03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:29.120]  I think we do.
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:30.120]  I think we have.
[03:22:30.120 --> 03:22:34.120]  We're spoiled for choice where independent media is concerned.
[03:22:34.120 --> 03:22:37.120]  And so we take it for granted.
[03:22:37.120 --> 03:22:39.120]  And we can't afford to.
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:43.120]  We can't afford to take it for granted because if Infowars didn't exist,
[03:22:43.120 --> 03:22:48.120]  if there were no other truthers out there telling you what is really happening,
[03:22:48.120 --> 03:22:50.120]  how would you prepare?
[03:22:50.120 --> 03:22:53.120]  How would you know that food shortages are coming?
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:56.120]  How would you know that a financial collapse is coming?
[03:22:56.120 --> 03:22:58.120]  Would the mainstream media tell you no?
[03:22:58.120 --> 03:23:02.120]  They would tell you after they'd already orchestrated their attack
[03:23:02.120 --> 03:23:06.120]  so that you were left paralysed and unable to do anything,
[03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:11.120]  but depend on the government to help your family, to help your family survive.
[03:23:11.120 --> 03:23:15.120]  Just think about the literal hell that would be on earth.
[03:23:15.120 --> 03:23:19.120]  This is why they want to silence this platform so much.
[03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:22.120]  This is why they have attacked Infowars like they have.
[03:23:22.120 --> 03:23:26.120]  This is why Alex Jones was guilty before he even walked into the courtroom
[03:23:26.120 --> 03:23:29.120]  and wasn't even able to defend himself.
[03:23:29.120 --> 03:23:31.120]  Wasn't even able to counter the...
[03:23:31.120 --> 03:23:35.120]  I mean, if you watch that, if you watch the way that the judge behaved,
[03:23:35.120 --> 03:23:36.120]  it was lunacy.
[03:23:36.120 --> 03:23:39.120]  I couldn't believe that I was seeing this in the 21st century.
[03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:43.120]  But considering the information that Alex and Infowars have brought,
[03:23:43.120 --> 03:23:49.120]  it's not surprising that they want them shut down.
[03:23:49.120 --> 03:23:53.120]  Klaus Schwab called for a mastering of the future
[03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:56.120]  at the Davos opening statement this year.
[03:23:56.120 --> 03:23:58.120]  What does a mastering of the future look like?
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:03.120]  Well, that looks like them wanting to be your masters.
[03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:07.120]  Do you know the reports are out there
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:11.120]  that they had to engage 5,000 Swiss troops
[03:24:11.120 --> 03:24:14.120]  to protect the attendees at Davos this year?
[03:24:14.120 --> 03:24:17.120]  Not only that, they had nowhere near as many world leaders
[03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:19.120]  as they invited to actually turn up because they realized
[03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:22.120]  that any association with the World Economic Forum
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:24.120]  is literal career suicide.
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:28.120]  But they needed 5,000 Swiss troops to protect them.
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:30.120]  Number one, the problem with that is that the military
[03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:35.120]  are protecting these globalist, satanic, pedophile elites.
[03:24:35.120 --> 03:24:39.120]  But number two, why would you need 5,000 troops to protect you?
[03:24:39.120 --> 03:24:43.120]  Are you protecting yourselves against assassination attempts?
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:45.120]  And I'm not calling for that. I want to be really clear.
[03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:47.120]  I'm not calling for that.
[03:24:47.120 --> 03:24:51.120]  But to engage 5,000 troops to protect a small group of people
[03:24:51.120 --> 03:24:54.120]  shows you just how scared they are.
[03:24:54.120 --> 03:24:56.120]  And they're scared because of this broadcast
[03:24:56.120 --> 03:24:59.120]  and they're scared because the viewer that takes this information
[03:24:59.120 --> 03:25:02.120]  and takes it out into the world, into the battlefield,
[03:25:02.120 --> 03:25:06.120]  into the digital space and you fight this war
[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:09.120]  with all of your heart and all of your integrity
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:13.120]  and all of your knowledge that they don't want you to have.
[03:25:13.120 --> 03:25:16.120]  They want to crush your heart. They want to crush your integrity
[03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:19.120]  and they don't want you to know the truth.
[03:25:19.120 --> 03:25:23.120]  And yet here we are, prevailing against them every single day
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:26.120]  with the truth, with the knowledge, with the resilience
[03:25:26.120 --> 03:25:28.120]  that they could only dream of having.
[03:25:28.120 --> 03:25:30.120]  These people can't stand criticism.
[03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:32.120]  They shut you down for criticising them.
[03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:34.120]  You make some bad comments on their social media,
[03:25:34.120 --> 03:25:36.120]  they turn the comments off.
[03:25:36.120 --> 03:25:38.120]  They can't handle criticism.
[03:25:38.120 --> 03:25:41.120]  And it's not even false accusations that we're talking about.
[03:25:41.120 --> 03:25:44.120]  It's just criticism. They can't handle it
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:49.120]  because their egos are so big and they have no integrity.
[03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:52.120]  People of character can handle criticism
[03:25:52.120 --> 03:25:55.120]  and respond accordingly.
[03:25:55.120 --> 03:25:57.120]  They are weak.
[03:25:57.120 --> 03:26:00.120]  They are the scum of the earth. Everyone of them.
[03:26:00.120 --> 03:26:02.120]  Look at them. Look at them.
[03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:04.120]  This is the scum of the earth.
[03:26:04.120 --> 03:26:06.120]  And for those that want to shut down this broadcast
[03:26:06.120 --> 03:26:09.120]  from this attendee list, look at yourself.
[03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:12.120]  You are the scum of the earth.
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:14.120]  Look at yourselves.
[03:26:14.120 --> 03:26:17.120]  You think you're part of some elite club.
[03:26:17.120 --> 03:26:20.120]  You are part of a dying class, a dying breed.
[03:26:20.120 --> 03:26:23.120]  No one wants you anymore.
[03:26:23.120 --> 03:26:25.120]  And that is why half of your attendees
[03:26:25.120 --> 03:26:27.120]  didn't even bother to turn up
[03:26:27.120 --> 03:26:30.120]  because they know that their time is done.
[03:26:30.120 --> 03:26:32.120]  It's only a matter of time before the world realises
[03:26:32.120 --> 03:26:35.120]  and this is why we need to keep Infowalls alive.
[03:26:35.120 --> 03:26:37.120]  This is why we need independent media alive.
[03:26:37.120 --> 03:26:39.120]  So again, go to infowallstore.com.
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:43.120]  Support this broadcast. Buy high quality products.

[03:26:52.120 --> 03:26:57.120]  Ursula von der Leyen just recently said at Davos,
[03:26:57.120 --> 03:27:00.120]  she said the next decades will see
[03:27:00.120 --> 03:27:03.120]  the greatest industrial transformation of our times,
[03:27:03.120 --> 03:27:06.120]  maybe of any time.
[03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:08.120]  What does that mean?
[03:27:08.120 --> 03:27:10.120]  Well, German state broadcaster WDR
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:13.120]  recently told people in a public service announcement
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:16.120]  that washing once a week is necessary
[03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:20.120]  to meet the goals of the great reset agenda.
[03:27:20.120 --> 03:27:24.120]  That's what mastering the future looks like.
[03:27:24.120 --> 03:27:27.120]  Now, they'll tell you this stuff
[03:27:27.120 --> 03:27:30.120]  and the mainstream media presents it as
[03:27:30.120 --> 03:27:32.120]  we're going to save the planet.
[03:27:32.120 --> 03:27:35.120]  We're going to meet our climate goals.
[03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:37.120]  They don't tell you that this is coming
[03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:39.120]  from a secret group of elites.
[03:27:39.120 --> 03:27:40.120]  Now, people will say,
[03:27:40.120 --> 03:27:43.120]  oh, well, the Davos meetings are broadcasted
[03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:45.120]  on the internet for everyone to see.
[03:27:45.120 --> 03:27:49.120]  It's what happens in the space that they don't broadcast.
[03:27:49.120 --> 03:27:53.120]  What they broadcast is their show,
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:54.120]  of them saying,
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:57.120]  this is what we're going to do to you.
[03:27:57.120 --> 03:28:00.120]  And what the counter attack to that is,
[03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:02.120]  no, you're not going to do this to us.
[03:28:02.120 --> 03:28:04.120]  This is what it really means.
[03:28:04.120 --> 03:28:06.120]  Shut off the mainstream media.
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:08.120]  Heck, turn off your television altogether
[03:28:08.120 --> 03:28:12.120]  unless you're streaming this broadcast on there.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:15.120]  And tell the world what it really means.
[03:28:15.120 --> 03:28:17.120]  Do you know how much their numbers are dying?
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:19.120]  Because of the mainstream media are dying
[03:28:19.120 --> 03:28:21.120]  and they're holding on for dear life,
[03:28:21.120 --> 03:28:22.120]  broadcasting nonsense,
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:24.120]  virtue signaling about Ukraine
[03:28:24.120 --> 03:28:26.120]  and, you know, changing your gender
[03:28:26.120 --> 03:28:28.120]  and all of the things that they are trying
[03:28:28.120 --> 03:28:31.120]  to force people to care about when they don't.
[03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.120]  They are a dying breed.
[03:28:33.120 --> 03:28:35.120]  And independent media is the new media.
[03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:37.120]  Keep Info Wars alive, people.
[03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:39.120]  I'm telling you, we need it.
[03:28:39.120 --> 03:28:41.120]  Right on the other side of the break
[03:28:41.120 --> 03:28:43.120]  will be joined by Bobby Sorcelito
[03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:45.120]  to talk to us about his take
[03:28:45.120 --> 03:28:47.120]  on what's happening in the world.
[03:28:47.120 --> 03:29:16.120]  Let's get to the other side of this short break.
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:19.120]  Let's get to the other side of this short break.
[03:29:47.120 --> 03:29:59.120]  In early 2022, Info Wars launched
[03:29:59.120 --> 03:30:02.120]  a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:30:02.120 --> 03:30:04.120]  Your support of that fundraiser
[03:30:04.120 --> 03:30:07.120]  is the reason we are still here today
[03:30:07.120 --> 03:30:08.120]  fighting the globalist
[03:30:08.120 --> 03:30:11.120]  and having incredibly successful results.
[03:30:11.120 --> 03:30:13.120]  So I thank you for your passion and support.
[03:30:13.120 --> 03:30:15.120]  Now that was a three coin series,
[03:30:15.120 --> 03:30:17.120]  the founding member coin.
[03:30:17.120 --> 03:30:19.120]  The final coin that we are putting out
[03:30:19.120 --> 03:30:21.120]  for a long time
[03:30:21.120 --> 03:30:25.120]  is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin
[03:30:25.120 --> 03:30:30.120]  exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[03:30:30.120 --> 03:30:33.120]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[03:30:33.120 --> 03:30:35.120]  And yes, there is a markup on the coins
[03:30:35.120 --> 03:30:37.120]  because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:30:37.120 --> 03:30:39.120]  The coin is the collector's item momento
[03:30:39.120 --> 03:30:42.120]  of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:42.120 --> 03:30:44.120]  So if you want to get one of these coins
[03:30:44.120 --> 03:30:45.120]  they're going fast,
[03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:48.120]  and you can get $30 off on the coin
[03:30:48.120 --> 03:30:54.120]  with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[03:30:54.120 --> 03:30:56.120]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:30:56.120 --> 03:31:00.120]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[03:31:00.120 --> 03:31:02.120]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:02.120 --> 03:31:06.120]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:06.120 --> 03:31:08.120]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars,
[03:31:08.120 --> 03:31:11.120]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:31:11.120 --> 03:31:15.120]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:18.120]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[03:31:18.120 --> 03:31:20.120]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[03:31:20.120 --> 03:31:22.120]  five, six, seven days a week,
[03:31:22.120 --> 03:31:24.120]  it's really just incredible.
[03:31:24.120 --> 03:31:26.120]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew,
[03:31:26.120 --> 03:31:28.120]  I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:28.120 --> 03:31:30.120]  I only encourage you now to realize
[03:31:30.120 --> 03:31:33.120]  that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:33.120 --> 03:31:35.120]  I know you spread the word,
[03:31:35.120 --> 03:31:36.120]  I know you pray for us,
[03:31:36.120 --> 03:31:37.120]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[03:31:37.120 --> 03:31:39.120]  But most viewers and listeners,
[03:31:39.120 --> 03:31:41.120]  never go to InfoWarsTour.com
[03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:44.120]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:31:44.120 --> 03:31:46.120]  all at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:31:46.120 --> 03:31:48.120]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[03:31:48.120 --> 03:31:50.120]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:31:50.120 --> 03:31:53.120]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsTour.com,
[03:31:53.120 --> 03:31:55.120]  our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.120 --> 03:31:57.120]  Please take action now.
[03:32:06.120 --> 03:32:08.120]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[03:32:08.120 --> 03:32:11.120]  What if you knew the globalist operations and could stop it?
[03:32:11.120 --> 03:32:13.120]  Well, we've done the research.
[03:32:13.120 --> 03:32:15.120]  We have the number one best-selling book in the country,
[03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:17.120]  not just in politics, but period.
[03:32:17.120 --> 03:32:19.120]  It's the great reset in the world.
[03:32:19.120 --> 03:32:22.120]  You get a signed copy of this, the last 1400,
[03:32:22.120 --> 03:32:24.120]  keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:32:24.120 --> 03:32:25.120]  Please take action.
[03:32:25.120 --> 03:32:27.120]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:32:27.120 --> 03:32:29.120]  Get one of these signed copies and know
[03:32:29.120 --> 03:32:31.120]  you kept InfoWars on the air
[03:32:31.120 --> 03:32:33.120]  at the most critical juncture in our history.
[03:32:33.120 --> 03:32:35.120]  Again, 2023 is here.
[03:32:35.120 --> 03:32:37.120]  The last round of signed copies of the book.
[03:32:37.120 --> 03:32:39.120]  We also have unsigned copies as well.
[03:32:39.120 --> 03:32:42.120]  The signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[03:32:42.120 --> 03:32:43.120]  Thank you for your support.
[03:32:43.120 --> 03:33:12.120]  Again, get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:12.120 --> 03:33:15.120]  Well, Bobby Sorcelito is a comedian, political commentator,
[03:33:15.120 --> 03:33:18.120]  and internet personality, most notably recognized on Instagram
[03:33:18.120 --> 03:33:20.120]  as TakeNaps.
[03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:24.120]  He's a self-proclaimed loudmouth New England Guido
[03:33:24.120 --> 03:33:27.120]  living in South Florida and making comedy videos about politics,
[03:33:27.120 --> 03:33:30.120]  the economy, current events, real estate, roasting, travel,
[03:33:30.120 --> 03:33:31.120]  and dubious observations.
[03:33:31.120 --> 03:33:35.120]  And I'll tell you what, he is fantastic at waking up people
[03:33:35.120 --> 03:33:37.120]  and empowering them to exit the system.
[03:33:37.120 --> 03:33:39.120]  Bobby, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:33:39.120 --> 03:33:41.120]  It's great to have you.
[03:33:41.120 --> 03:33:43.120]  Thank you, my pleasure. Glad to be here.
[03:33:43.120 --> 03:33:45.120]  It's fantastic to see your face here.
[03:33:45.120 --> 03:33:48.120]  Okay, so just for the viewers, give us a quick intro about yourself
[03:33:48.120 --> 03:33:51.120]  and what you do, apart from what I just said.
[03:33:51.120 --> 03:33:55.120]  Yeah, so I'm an internet comedian, I guess you could say.
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:33:58.120]  I made a video that went viral two years ago
[03:33:58.120 --> 03:34:01.120]  about the first night of the DNC,
[03:34:01.120 --> 03:34:05.120]  and I realized that the marketplace needed this type of information.
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:08.120]  So I basically take complicated topics,
[03:34:08.120 --> 03:34:12.120]  and I create digestible, comical, short videos about them.
[03:34:12.120 --> 03:34:14.120]  I do some stand-up comedy as well,
[03:34:14.120 --> 03:34:17.120]  and I just pump out a ton of videos to try to wake people up
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:20.120]  in an entertaining and informative way.
[03:34:20.120 --> 03:34:22.120]  And you do a great job, Bobby.
[03:34:22.120 --> 03:34:25.120]  When did you first realize what was happening in the world?
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:28.120]  You know, it's actually funny being here
[03:34:28.120 --> 03:34:30.120]  because all roads lead back to Alex.
[03:34:30.120 --> 03:34:34.120]  The first video that I ever saw was Loose Change,
[03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:38.120]  the 9-11 documentary by Luke Rokowski, and that was in 2006.
[03:34:38.120 --> 03:34:42.120]  And once you kind of see underneath the curtain,
[03:34:42.120 --> 03:34:44.120]  we went straight to YouTube, some friends and I,
[03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:47.120]  and we ended up on the InfoWars YouTube channel,
[03:34:47.120 --> 03:34:50.120]  and there's like tens of millions of followers,
[03:34:50.120 --> 03:34:52.120]  and all of these views, like in the millions,
[03:34:52.120 --> 03:34:54.120]  and videos going up all day long,
[03:34:54.120 --> 03:34:57.120]  and we went right into the Alex Jones universe,
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:00.120]  and that was when you first see all this stuff, your head explodes,
[03:35:00.120 --> 03:35:04.120]  and really, Alex, interestingly enough, Full Circle
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:06.120]  was the person that woke me up to the most of this stuff
[03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:09.120]  at the very beginning, so it's so interesting being here
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:13.120]  16 years later, 18, 16 years later.
[03:35:13.120 --> 03:35:16.120]  It's a story for many people, Bobby.
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:19.120]  It really is, and many truth is in the movement.
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:22.120]  I really want to get your take on what's happening
[03:35:22.120 --> 03:35:24.120]  in the United States and the world,
[03:35:24.120 --> 03:35:28.120]  and why do you think people just can't see it?
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:32.120]  I think that it's such a, it's dark,
[03:35:32.120 --> 03:35:34.120]  and the vast majority of people, I think,
[03:35:34.120 --> 03:35:37.120]  just don't want to see how bad that it actually is,
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:39.120]  and that's kind of the same thing that I did.
[03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:42.120]  Interestingly enough, after a couple years of paying attention to Alex,
[03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:44.120]  I kind of had this moment where I was like,
[03:35:44.120 --> 03:35:48.120]  this is making me upset, sad, it's like depressing,
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:51.120]  and it kind of ruins how you live your life,
[03:35:51.120 --> 03:35:53.120]  because you're like, there's people that are coming to get me,
[03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:56.120]  get my family, they're ruining almost everything around us,
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:00.120]  and you just want to disconnect with it so you can live your life.
[03:36:00.120 --> 03:36:03.120]  And they've been doing it for decades, if not centuries,
[03:36:03.120 --> 03:36:05.120]  so it's very disheartening.
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:08.120]  And eventually you realize that I'm a fighting age now.
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:10.120]  If I don't participate in this battle,
[03:36:10.120 --> 03:36:12.120]  they're going to run through me,
[03:36:12.120 --> 03:36:15.120]  and my future children should I be so lucky to have them?
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:17.120]  And you just kind of realize this call to action.
[03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:19.120]  So I think that the vast majority of people
[03:36:19.120 --> 03:36:22.120]  just don't want to see what's uncomfortable to see.
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:24.120]  So what I try to do is bridge that gap
[03:36:24.120 --> 03:36:26.120]  between them, something that's fun, and entertaining,
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:28.120]  and digestible, while also showing them,
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:30.120]  hey, you should really look into this
[03:36:30.120 --> 03:36:32.120]  because they're coming for your kids.
[03:36:32.120 --> 03:36:35.120]  It's not about us anymore, it's about the future of this country,
[03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:37.120]  and really about the people that are here now
[03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:41.120]  that there's an encroaching enemy that they can't even see.
[03:36:41.120 --> 03:36:43.120]  You're absolutely right.
[03:36:43.120 --> 03:36:47.120]  Do you think that they're posing to get rid of Biden?
[03:36:47.120 --> 03:36:53.120]  I think that the general leftist playbook
[03:36:53.120 --> 03:36:55.120]  is you choose someone up and spit them out
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:36:58.120]  when they're no longer useful to the big picture.
[03:36:58.120 --> 03:37:00.120]  I think with Hakeem Jeffries, for example,
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:02.120]  and with Gavin Newsom,
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:04.120]  you have two very prominent figureheads
[03:37:04.120 --> 03:37:06.120]  that they're raising their star power
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:09.120]  that if they need to spit him up and discard him,
[03:37:09.120 --> 03:37:11.120]  they have these people waiting in the wings.
[03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:13.120]  Generally speaking, I think they have no strong candidates,
[03:37:13.120 --> 03:37:15.120]  but with him out of the picture,
[03:37:15.120 --> 03:37:18.120]  if he draws too much attention,
[03:37:18.120 --> 03:37:21.120]  they can let him soak all that up and then spit him out.
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:24.120]  I would say that that's kind of like maybe their play,
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:28.120]  but it depends on how angry the people get about it,
[03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:30.120]  which is why it's so important what we do.
[03:37:30.120 --> 03:37:33.120]  We need to be drawing attention to this stuff every single thing,
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:35.120]  because if you wait until the election is coming up,
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:38.120]  three months, four months before it, or even weeks before it,
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:40.120]  if people don't already know and have seen this pattern
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:42.120]  over a long period of time,
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:45.120]  they'll just be like, ah, it's just the crazy conspiracy people.
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:47.120]  Joe is actually my nice grandpa,
[03:37:47.120 --> 03:37:49.120]  he's going to bounce me on his knee
[03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:51.120]  because there's original and smell my hair,
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:52.120]  and everything is going to be okay.
[03:37:52.120 --> 03:37:55.120]  So that's why we need to keep this stuff going all the time.
[03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:57.120]  Yes.
[03:37:57.120 --> 03:37:59.120]  No, you're absolutely right, Bobby.
[03:37:59.120 --> 03:38:01.120]  It is that constant reminder,
[03:38:01.120 --> 03:38:03.120]  because what's the alternative,
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:05.120]  and I was just saying it before you came on,
[03:38:05.120 --> 03:38:08.120]  the alternative is having the mainstream media
[03:38:08.120 --> 03:38:13.120]  same rinse, wash, repeat, you know,
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:15.120]  propaganda in our faces all the time.
[03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:17.120]  There would be nothing to counter that.
[03:38:17.120 --> 03:38:20.120]  There would be nothing to challenge people's thinking,
[03:38:20.120 --> 03:38:23.120]  and so you'll have free thinkers that can think outside of that.
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:25.120]  But what about the rest?
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:27.120]  The rest that we actually need,
[03:38:27.120 --> 03:38:31.120]  because our lives depend on them waking up too.
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:34.120]  Yeah, I mean, Alex is so spot on about it.
[03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:36.120]  This is an information war.
[03:38:36.120 --> 03:38:38.120]  It's like people think that it needs to be violence
[03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:40.120]  and we need to take to the streets,
[03:38:40.120 --> 03:38:42.120]  but really it's a cultural thing.
[03:38:42.120 --> 03:38:44.120]  It's a mind game entirely.
[03:38:44.120 --> 03:38:46.120]  So it's like, if you want to fight on the front lines of this,
[03:38:46.120 --> 03:38:48.120]  what you really have to do is realize
[03:38:48.120 --> 03:38:50.120]  that there are people out there that are okay,
[03:38:50.120 --> 03:38:53.120]  that somebody wants to take your young boy or young girl
[03:38:53.120 --> 03:38:55.120]  and tell them that if they get this medical procedure
[03:38:55.120 --> 03:38:58.120]  or take these pills to stop the natural flow of nature,
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:00.120]  that that's okay.
[03:39:00.120 --> 03:39:03.120]  And it's like, they're complete savages
[03:39:03.120 --> 03:39:05.120]  and they're merchants of the darkness.
[03:39:05.120 --> 03:39:07.120]  And it's like, if you can't convince people
[03:39:07.120 --> 03:39:10.120]  that cutting off a kid's Pen 15 makes them a girl,
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:12.120]  if you can't convince them of something
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:14.120]  that's so obvious and blatant and right in front of their face,
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:16.120]  they'll never believe any of the other things
[03:39:16.120 --> 03:39:18.120]  that are a little bit more complicated
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:20.120]  or harder to process and digest.
[03:39:20.120 --> 03:39:22.120]  So we all have to be,
[03:39:22.120 --> 03:39:24.120]  we all have to take part in this actively and say,
[03:39:24.120 --> 03:39:26.120]  look, these are the most obvious things.
[03:39:26.120 --> 03:39:28.120]  These are the easy ones to cherry pick.
[03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:30.120]  If you guys can't see how obvious these are,
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:33.120]  you'll never understand the depths of the rest of it
[03:39:33.120 --> 03:39:36.120]  and how really dark and nefarious all of these other things are,
[03:39:36.120 --> 03:39:39.120]  which is why us as the intermediaries,
[03:39:39.120 --> 03:39:42.120]  the information digesters and then repackagers
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:44.120]  are so important in this battle.
[03:39:44.120 --> 03:39:48.120]  It's like, if somebody doesn't look at these very dark,
[03:39:48.120 --> 03:39:51.120]  very complicated, very nuanced topics
[03:39:51.120 --> 03:39:53.120]  and deliver them in a way that your average everyday person
[03:39:53.120 --> 03:39:55.120]  is willing to consume,
[03:39:55.120 --> 03:39:57.120]  willing to give it a minute and a half of their time,
[03:39:57.120 --> 03:39:59.120]  we'll never be able to convince them
[03:39:59.120 --> 03:40:01.120]  when there's something far more dire coming for them,
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:04.120]  even though it already is everywhere.
[03:40:04.120 --> 03:40:06.120]  And let's talk about the far more dire.
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:09.120]  You were speaking out a lot against the vaccines.
[03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:11.120]  They're not vaccines or injections.
[03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:13.120]  They're mandates.
[03:40:13.120 --> 03:40:16.120]  How did you help people digest that information?
[03:40:16.120 --> 03:40:20.120]  And what do you think was really successful early on,
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:24.120]  especially when people were fearful in breaking through that?
[03:40:24.120 --> 03:40:28.120]  Well, it's, I think that the most, it's so crazy
[03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:31.120]  because the deeper that you dive into this stuff
[03:40:31.120 --> 03:40:33.120]  and the more time you invest,
[03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:35.120]  the more you realize how obvious it is.
[03:40:35.120 --> 03:40:38.120]  And you're just like, are you guys seeing this?
[03:40:38.120 --> 03:40:41.120]  Like, are we, are we both on the planet of earth?
[03:40:41.120 --> 03:40:42.120]  Like, I don't understand.
[03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:45.120]  They were saying out of their face hole,
[03:40:45.120 --> 03:40:47.120]  they're on TV and they're just like,
[03:40:47.120 --> 03:40:50.120]  if you, if you die with this mysterious sickness,
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:52.120]  it doesn't matter if you get shot in the head
[03:40:52.120 --> 03:40:55.120]  or eaten by an alligator or run over by a train.
[03:40:55.120 --> 03:40:58.120]  If we test you while you're in here, that's a COVID death.
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:00.120]  And the other thing that's so amazing,
[03:41:00.120 --> 03:41:04.120]  which I think, which I think kind of woke people up is like,
[03:41:04.120 --> 03:41:08.120]  the hospitals were getting prepaid,
[03:41:08.120 --> 03:41:12.120]  prepaid based on the estimated infection rate in their area,
[03:41:12.120 --> 03:41:15.120]  prepaid for how many people were going to have this sickness
[03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:18.120]  and come in and then they were getting paid if people died.
[03:41:18.120 --> 03:41:20.120]  They were getting paid if people are on ventilators.
[03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:22.120]  Now think about, think about money just in general,
[03:41:22.120 --> 03:41:24.120]  you as an individual person,
[03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:27.120]  if you got a prepayment in the tens of thousands,
[03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:29.120]  tens of millions of dollars and they said,
[03:41:29.120 --> 03:41:31.120]  oh, if enough people don't get sick with this,
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:33.120]  well, you have to pay that money back.
[03:41:33.120 --> 03:41:35.120]  You're going to do everything that you can
[03:41:35.120 --> 03:41:38.120]  to make sure that you meet those numbers and meet those quotas.
[03:41:38.120 --> 03:41:42.120]  They were financially incentivized to test people
[03:41:42.120 --> 03:41:44.120]  and have them test positive.
[03:41:44.120 --> 03:41:47.120]  They were as financially incentivized to put people on ventilators,
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:49.120]  which a vast majority of them died as a result.
[03:41:49.120 --> 03:41:52.120]  They were incentivized for these tests to read as positive.
[03:41:52.120 --> 03:41:57.120]  So who knew, who knows what type of darkness was happening in there.
[03:41:57.120 --> 03:42:00.120]  So it's like, aside from that,
[03:42:00.120 --> 03:42:02.120]  they were saying right out of their face,
[03:42:02.120 --> 03:42:04.120]  they were on the White House podium and they're just like,
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:06.120]  we're counting all these as COVID deaths,
[03:42:06.120 --> 03:42:08.120]  even if they don't die of COVID.
[03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:12.120]  And I think that their actual words were the most standing,
[03:42:12.120 --> 03:42:15.120]  where they're just like, oh, here it is six months later.
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:18.120]  Oh, the average comorbidity was 3.6.
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:21.120]  And oh, by the way, did you know that the vast majority of people
[03:42:21.120 --> 03:42:23.120]  that are dying from this are 78-something years old
[03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:25.120]  or 80-something years old?
[03:42:25.120 --> 03:42:27.120]  It's like, they said it.
[03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:29.120]  It's just people just don't look.
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:31.120]  They have such blindness and that's the big problem.
[03:42:31.120 --> 03:42:33.120]  I think with the entire world.
[03:42:33.120 --> 03:42:35.120]  That's the cultural problem that we're really up against,
[03:42:35.120 --> 03:42:41.120]  which is why does your everyday average citizen not listen to what they're saying?
[03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:45.120]  Why do they not do even the slightest bit of basic research to see the truth?
[03:42:45.120 --> 03:42:48.120]  They say it. They hide in plain sight.
[03:42:48.120 --> 03:42:51.120]  Bobby, we're going to continue this right on the other side of the break.
[03:42:51.120 --> 03:42:56.120]  I want to hear more from you on why the populace won't listen. Population.
[03:42:56.120 --> 03:43:03.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy

[03:43:24.120 --> 03:43:27.120]  There are only about a thousand of these left.

[03:43:32.120 --> 03:43:34.120]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later.
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:36.120]  There's a piece of art that goes with the book,
[03:43:36.120 --> 03:43:39.120]  but I haven't even decided what I'm going to do that. It may never happen.
[03:43:39.120 --> 03:43:43.120]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books and to be part of this fundraiser,

[03:43:56.120 --> 03:43:59.120]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[03:43:59.120 --> 03:44:04.120]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[03:44:04.120 --> 03:44:09.120]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:14.120]  But through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds
[03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:17.120]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[03:44:17.120 --> 03:44:20.120]  And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great,
[03:44:20.120 --> 03:44:23.120]  we've got a real game changer now.
[03:44:23.120 --> 03:44:25.120]  We've never put anything out as powerful.

[03:45:56.120 --> 03:46:01.120]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writer and satirist in Mines,
[03:46:01.120 --> 03:46:05.120]  famously said more than 150 years ago,
[03:46:05.120 --> 03:46:08.120]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[03:46:08.120 --> 03:46:12.120]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:46:12.120 --> 03:46:15.120]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:19.120]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[03:46:19.120 --> 03:46:22.120]  Because of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:25.120]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down,
[03:46:25.120 --> 03:46:27.120]  if they can convince you that we're going away,
[03:46:27.120 --> 03:46:31.120]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:46:31.120 --> 03:46:35.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars,
[03:46:35.120 --> 03:46:37.120]  and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:46:37.120 --> 03:46:39.120]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:46:39.120 --> 03:46:44.120]  If you decide to go to infowars.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more,
[03:46:44.120 --> 03:46:46.120]  we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:48.120]  It is all in your hands.
[03:46:48.120 --> 03:46:51.120]  So thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists,
[03:46:51.120 --> 03:46:54.120]  go to infowars.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:46:54.120 --> 03:46:55.120]  It's up to you.
[03:46:57.120 --> 03:47:04.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.120 --> 03:47:14.120]  And we're back with Bobby Sorcelito.
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:18.120]  Bobby was just saying before the break how the masses just,
[03:47:18.120 --> 03:47:21.120]  even though it's staring them right in the face, they just won't wake up.
[03:47:21.120 --> 03:47:25.120]  This is why his delivery is so fantastic, because it's digestible.
[03:47:25.120 --> 03:47:26.120]  They understand it.
[03:47:26.120 --> 03:47:28.120]  Bobby, please continue what you were saying before the break.
[03:47:30.120 --> 03:47:34.120]  I was going nuts there for a second, so I actually thought,
[03:47:34.120 --> 03:47:40.120]  but basically that if things are so obvious and they're hiding in plain sight,
[03:47:40.120 --> 03:47:45.120]  and we can see it so clearly, it's like if we can't convince people to understand
[03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:49.120]  the very basics, the things that are objectively true and clear and right in their face,
[03:47:49.120 --> 03:47:52.120]  that they'll never understand the really complicated things.
[03:47:52.120 --> 03:47:58.120]  And the other thing too is that so many people are suffering as a result of this,
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:02.120]  that if you choose to disconnect yourself from it and just get out of it,
[03:48:02.120 --> 03:48:08.120]  you're basically standing idly by why people around the entire world needlessly suffer
[03:48:08.120 --> 03:48:09.120]  under the hands of these people.
[03:48:09.120 --> 03:48:12.120]  And just because you're looking the other way and just because you're not paying attention,
[03:48:12.120 --> 03:48:16.120]  means that they're just going to keep encroaching now until forever.
[03:48:16.120 --> 03:48:19.120]  Without any resistance at all, their plans will go on unabated.
[03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:24.120]  And this is decades, if not centuries long, but I do believe the one differentiator
[03:48:24.120 --> 03:48:29.120]  between maybe now being the time where their plan actually gets foiled
[03:48:29.120 --> 03:48:33.120]  is through the phone, through the internet, and through broadcasts like these.
[03:48:33.120 --> 03:48:37.120]  The ability for you to organize and distribute information at a time quicker
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:40.120]  than any other time in human history.
[03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:46.120]  The individual and the cultural change, the cultural awareness of you just simply telling
[03:48:46.120 --> 03:48:51.120]  and talking to the people in your social circles about this is the only
[03:48:51.120 --> 03:48:57.120]  and also the best line of defense from preventing them from doing more evil things.
[03:48:57.120 --> 03:48:59.120]  I absolutely agree with you, Bobby.
[03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:01.120]  This is the biggest tool that we have.
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:06.120]  And as much as I encourage people to spend time outdoors and get off their phones,
[03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:11.120]  every waking moment that I have, I'm spending in this digital war, in this information war.
[03:49:11.120 --> 03:49:18.120]  So we have to see it as a tool and obviously not let it control our lives, which is what they want.
[03:49:18.120 --> 03:49:21.120]  I want to get your take on the Ukraine situation.
[03:49:21.120 --> 03:49:25.120]  President T-shirt as you've fondly named him.
[03:49:25.120 --> 03:49:29.120]  The United States funneling all this money to the Krain.
[03:49:29.120 --> 03:49:38.120]  Yeah, it's a, to me, I made a video about this last night where I basically broke down the whole process in six minutes.
[03:49:38.120 --> 03:49:43.120]  The military industrial complex is financially incentivized for us to be in a conflict.
[03:49:43.120 --> 03:49:46.120]  And if you were to be a detective and you were trying to solve a crime,
[03:49:46.120 --> 03:49:49.120]  the first thing that you establish is what is the motive?
[03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:50.120]  Who is seeing to benefit?
[03:49:50.120 --> 03:49:54.120]  If you can disconnect yourself from all the propaganda that they put on TV
[03:49:54.120 --> 03:50:00.120]  and just look at it for who is the primary beneficiary of us being in some international conflict.
[03:50:00.120 --> 03:50:06.120]  The clear and obvious beneficiary is the military industrial complex and all the U.S. defense contractors.
[03:50:06.120 --> 03:50:09.120]  All these companies are making money so long as we're in this war.
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:14.120]  They're financially incentivized for us to remain in a perpetual and never-ending war,
[03:50:14.120 --> 03:50:18.120]  whether it be with the Krain and Prezi T-shirt, the hero of our time supposedly,
[03:50:18.120 --> 03:50:21.120]  or Afghanistan or whatever is the next conflict.
[03:50:21.120 --> 03:50:24.120]  They establish a hero, which is Prezi sweatshirt.
[03:50:24.120 --> 03:50:28.120]  They establish a villain, which is, which is, which is a Putin.
[03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:30.120]  And they say, look, these two people are in the battle.
[03:50:30.120 --> 03:50:31.120]  Focus on them.
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:33.120]  Raise this guy to hero status.
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:37.120]  Lower this guy to demon status and don't let him speak at all.
[03:50:37.120 --> 03:50:40.120]  And meanwhile, the cash register keeps pumping.
[03:50:40.120 --> 03:50:45.120]  All the, all the defense contractors are making money every single day that this happens.
[03:50:45.120 --> 03:50:50.120]  And the only thing that they want to do is, is not stop the money flow.
[03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:54.120]  There's so many other companies that are, that are intertwined with them that are all financially
[03:50:54.120 --> 03:50:56.120]  incentivized for this to continue.
[03:50:56.120 --> 03:51:00.120]  And then they have all the lobbyists and all the attorneys on K Street and all these people
[03:51:00.120 --> 03:51:04.120]  that are there saying, look, this is a little bit of a drip of cash because the only person
[03:51:04.120 --> 03:51:08.120]  that loses is human beings and the American taxpayer.
[03:51:08.120 --> 03:51:09.120]  We're the ones that lose.
[03:51:09.120 --> 03:51:10.120]  They're the ones that gain.
[03:51:10.120 --> 03:51:14.120]  So anybody that's in that financial chain wants this to continue on forever.
[03:51:14.120 --> 03:51:15.120]  It's far and away.
[03:51:15.120 --> 03:51:16.120]  It's thousands of miles away.
[03:51:16.120 --> 03:51:19.120]  What do they care about human lives being cost over there?
[03:51:19.120 --> 03:51:20.120]  They could care less.
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:22.120]  All they care about is that money.
[03:51:22.120 --> 03:51:26.120]  So these military, these military, the military industrial complex and these defense contractors
[03:51:26.120 --> 03:51:31.120]  are financially incentivized and all the companies intertwined with them to keep this going forever.
[03:51:31.120 --> 03:51:35.120]  And if any other politician doesn't want to play ball, they'll remove them just like
[03:51:35.120 --> 03:51:36.120]  they remove anybody else.
[03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:40.120]  These people are appointed based on all the money that they have intertwined in politics.
[03:51:40.120 --> 03:51:45.120]  Matt Gaetz, I was watching Alex yesterday and he was talking about how Matt Gaetz spoke
[03:51:45.120 --> 03:51:50.120]  and he was talking about how if you want to get on this board, you have to donate $75,000
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:53.120]  to this charity and then you sit on this board.
[03:51:53.120 --> 03:51:55.120]  Who's paying that 75?
[03:51:55.120 --> 03:52:01.120]  Are you paying 75K out of your 175K salary to be a public servant to get on that board?
[03:52:01.120 --> 03:52:04.120]  No, the lobbyists and all the financiers are paying for that.
[03:52:04.120 --> 03:52:08.120]  So they're all financially incentivized and it's that simple.
[03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:11.120]  Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
[03:52:11.120 --> 03:52:17.120]  They make this guy a hero and they extract as much money as possible from us that gets printed
[03:52:17.120 --> 03:52:18.120]  out of thin air.
[03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:22.120]  And human beings suffer, the American people suffer and the military industrial complex
[03:52:22.120 --> 03:52:24.120]  benefits, which is always their strategy.
[03:52:24.120 --> 03:52:28.120]  If we were out of a war for six months, they were chomping at the bit to find a new one.
[03:52:28.120 --> 03:52:32.120]  And Ukraine was a worthy target for them.
[03:52:32.120 --> 03:52:35.120]  Yes, and we're worried about someone else's borders yet.
[03:52:35.120 --> 03:52:41.120]  I say we, but I'm talking about the United States, but zero of securing your own borders.
[03:52:41.120 --> 03:52:46.120]  And this is absolutely in an attempt to topple and destabilize the United States.
[03:52:46.120 --> 03:52:49.120]  They don't want it to be the world's superpower anymore.
[03:52:49.120 --> 03:52:52.120]  That is a clear agenda goal.
[03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:56.120]  Do you think that people are fed up with this, that people have realized what's happening
[03:52:56.120 --> 03:53:01.120]  with the borders and are they seeing the double standard here with the United States borders
[03:53:01.120 --> 03:53:04.120]  and Ukraine?
[03:53:04.120 --> 03:53:09.120]  That's the thing is that the hypocrisy in my opinion saying, look at the hypocrisy.
[03:53:09.120 --> 03:53:11.120]  That was the 2022 argument.
[03:53:11.120 --> 03:53:13.120]  We tried that and it didn't work.
[03:53:13.120 --> 03:53:19.120]  It has to be like, we need to, the message I think needs to be like, these people are
[03:53:19.120 --> 03:53:20.120]  demons.
[03:53:20.120 --> 03:53:22.120]  These are merchants of the darkness.
[03:53:22.120 --> 03:53:24.120]  And I don't mean necessarily demons in a biblical sense.
[03:53:24.120 --> 03:53:29.120]  I mean people that are completely flippant and could care less about sacrificing human
[03:53:29.120 --> 03:53:30.120]  life.
[03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:33.120]  And if you connect all of these things together, it makes perfect sense.
[03:53:33.120 --> 03:53:37.120]  These people are completely money driven and they're, they're evil.
[03:53:37.120 --> 03:53:41.120]  It's not about, it's not about, it's not about just, just being money hungry.
[03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:45.120]  It's like people will, are willing to sacrifice other human lives for this.
[03:53:45.120 --> 03:53:48.120]  So it's like our border and all of these things all make sense.
[03:53:48.120 --> 03:53:55.120]  If you look at it in totality, it's like destroy any and all, destroy any and all freedom anywhere
[03:53:55.120 --> 03:54:00.120]  in the world, destroy any superpower that would, that would stop the globalist agenda
[03:54:00.120 --> 03:54:03.120]  and ruin any person that dare come at the king, so to speak.
[03:54:03.120 --> 03:54:05.120]  So they, they hide in plain sight.
[03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:06.120]  That's the thing.
[03:54:06.120 --> 03:54:08.120]  What they're doing is slapping us in the face with it.
[03:54:08.120 --> 03:54:12.120]  Our border not being secure is them just being like, look, this is what we're going to do
[03:54:12.120 --> 03:54:14.120]  to you and you're going to do nothing about it.
[03:54:14.120 --> 03:54:17.120]  And by the way, we're also coming for your kids, by the way.
[03:54:17.120 --> 03:54:21.120]  So sorry about that, but we're going to do whatever we want as long as we want.
[03:54:21.120 --> 03:54:25.120]  So if people just, if people can't see the hypocrisy of it, we have to, we have to try
[03:54:25.120 --> 03:54:29.120]  to try a little bit of a different strategy, which is like, these are merchants of darkness
[03:54:29.120 --> 03:54:30.120]  and people are dying.
[03:54:30.120 --> 03:54:34.120]  People get emotionally manipulated by the media where they're like, oh, Ukraine, flag
[03:54:34.120 --> 03:54:35.120]  and bio.
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:36.120]  Look, he's so brave.
[03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:37.120]  He's on the cover of Vogue.
[03:54:37.120 --> 03:54:38.120]  He's our friend.
[03:54:38.120 --> 03:54:39.120]  I want to have a beer with him.
[03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:42.120]  Sean Penn pats him on the back and Derek Zulander goes over there and gives him a high five
[03:54:42.120 --> 03:54:43.120]  and they all hug.
[03:54:43.120 --> 03:54:46.120]  And it's just like, these people are dark demons.
[03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:50.120]  And if you can get them to disconnect from the mainstream media, they would realize that
[03:54:50.120 --> 03:54:51.120]  human beings are dying.
[03:54:51.120 --> 03:54:55.120]  If we put that energy that we put into sending the missiles into brokering a peace deal, which
[03:54:55.120 --> 03:55:00.120]  we could certainly do, think about how many people would benefit, how many less people
[03:55:00.120 --> 03:55:01.120]  would suffer.
[03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:03.120]  But why does anything happen?
[03:55:03.120 --> 03:55:05.120]  Because there's money attached to it.
[03:55:05.120 --> 03:55:07.120]  Every single thing is attached to the money.
[03:55:07.120 --> 03:55:10.120]  The only reason we're there is so that these guys can profit.
[03:55:10.120 --> 03:55:13.120]  That's it.
[03:55:13.120 --> 03:55:19.120]  I really want to focus on the fact that what you're saying is so true and you're right about
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:21.120]  having a different approach.
[03:55:21.120 --> 03:55:26.120]  We're running out of time in the sense that they want to accelerate.
[03:55:26.120 --> 03:55:28.120]  They realize they're losing.
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:30.120]  They may draw their wildcard at any time.
[03:55:30.120 --> 03:55:34.120]  And I warn about this, cyber COVID, the shutdown, all of that.
[03:55:34.120 --> 03:55:37.120]  I'll speak more in detail about that another time, but they could draw their wildcard.
[03:55:37.120 --> 03:55:42.120]  So we're in a race against the clock, Bobby, where we've got to wake up the masses, grab
[03:55:42.120 --> 03:55:46.120]  them by the shoulders and shake them and scream in their faces almost.
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:48.120]  We've got about two minutes left.
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:54.120]  I just want you to talk about the ways that we need to protect our own countries, get
[03:55:54.120 --> 03:55:59.120]  our people to love their countries again, and fight for what's right, and then tell
[03:55:59.120 --> 03:56:01.120]  people where they can find you before we wrap up.
[03:56:01.120 --> 03:56:03.120]  We've got a minute 40.
[03:56:03.120 --> 03:56:11.120]  The greatest defense to their agenda is personal excellence.
[03:56:11.120 --> 03:56:12.120]  Start with yourself.
[03:56:12.120 --> 03:56:14.120]  Be the healthiest that you possibly can be.
[03:56:14.120 --> 03:56:18.120]  Understand the food that you eat and the physical exercise that you put yourself through from
[03:56:18.120 --> 03:56:19.120]  day to day.
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:23.120]  Become mentally resilient to all of the darkness that's coming at you from every possible
[03:56:23.120 --> 03:56:24.120]  direction.
[03:56:24.120 --> 03:56:28.120]  My friend, Andy for cellist says personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion.
[03:56:28.120 --> 03:56:33.120]  So make sure that you are the highest operating and best version of yourself because you saying
[03:56:33.120 --> 03:56:38.120]  things to other people is not nearly as powerful as the actions that you take and what you choose
[03:56:38.120 --> 03:56:39.120]  to do in your life.
[03:56:39.120 --> 03:56:43.120]  If they see you outwork and if they see you changing how you eat, if they see you changing
[03:56:43.120 --> 03:56:48.120]  the information you discuss and the conversations that you have with other people, your greatness
[03:56:48.120 --> 03:56:51.120]  will inspire greatness just through osmosis.
[03:56:51.120 --> 03:56:56.120]  So number one is make sure that you're the healthiest entity you could possibly be.
[03:56:56.120 --> 03:57:01.120]  The second thing is we grossly underestimate the power of our words and actions.
[03:57:01.120 --> 03:57:06.120]  We grossly underestimate how people can see us and what they glean from our example.
[03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:11.120]  If you lead and you go out there and you say things online and you broadcast that information
[03:57:11.120 --> 03:57:15.120]  and you change the conversation at the bar to a conversation at the gym and you change
[03:57:15.120 --> 03:57:19.120]  that conversation around the dinner table to say hey are you guys paying attention to
[03:57:19.120 --> 03:57:20.120]  this?
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:21.120]  Are you thinking about this?
[03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:23.120]  Then you can change the way that the world operates.
[03:57:23.120 --> 03:57:25.120]  You don't need to tell people what to think.
[03:57:25.120 --> 03:57:30.120]  You just need to teach them how to think and the simplest thing you can do is say hey do
[03:57:30.120 --> 03:57:31.120]  more research.
[03:57:31.120 --> 03:57:32.120]  Absolutely teach them how to think.

[03:58:55.720 --> 03:58:57.120]  I'm going to do that right now.
[03:58:57.120 --> 03:59:01.040]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[03:59:01.040 --> 03:59:06.240]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[03:59:06.240 --> 03:59:11.080]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones
[03:59:11.080 --> 03:59:12.080]  including myself.
[03:59:12.080 --> 03:59:16.800]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[03:59:16.800 --> 03:59:20.560]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex
[03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:21.560]  Jones.
[03:59:21.560 --> 03:59:25.680]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[03:59:25.680 --> 03:59:26.680]  Tim Cass IRL.
[03:59:26.680 --> 03:59:32.560]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because
[03:59:32.560 --> 03:59:34.880]  you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:59:34.880 --> 03:59:37.680]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
