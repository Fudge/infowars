[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.400 --> 00:26.960]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26.960 --> 00:33.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us. It is the seventh day of May, 2013. I
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.600]  am your host, Alex Jones. We will be here for the next three hours live. William Gein
[00:38.600 --> 00:46.000]  of Alipak, one of the major pro-sovereignty, anti-completely open border groups. William
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.080]  Gein will be joining us for about 30 minutes in the next hour to really break down what
[00:51.080 --> 00:57.840]  is in the different versions of the amnesty bill. That is really the North American Union,
[00:57.840 --> 01:03.280]  trillion dollars every five years, they're estimating conservatively, program that will
[01:03.280 --> 01:06.680]  just complete this country's journey into banana republic.
[01:06.680 --> 01:13.700]  They try to spin it like it's hospitality, have open borders. But you can't go to Mexico
[01:13.700 --> 01:21.520]  or Guatemala or Nigeria or Russia for that matter and just say, I want to have my babies
[01:21.520 --> 01:29.760]  for free. I want free welfare. I want everything and I'm above the law. But in the West, the
[01:29.760 --> 01:33.640]  globalists use immigrant populations as a pro-government group.
[01:33.640 --> 01:39.040]  They don't fund the immigrant groups because they care about them. They do it because they're
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.740]  using them to drive down wages. And that's what NAFTA and GATT has done. NAFTA has destroyed
[01:44.740 --> 01:49.360]  Mexico. Mexico's standard of living has gone down. Look at all the numbers. If you want
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.840]  to help Mexico, you end the drug war, you end drug prohibition, that'll end a lot of
[01:53.840 --> 01:55.280]  the organized crime.
[01:55.280 --> 02:01.160]  And Mexico has more billionaires per capita than any other country in the world because
[02:01.160 --> 02:07.120]  it is totally centralized with a tiny group of filthy rich people who have gotten their
[02:07.120 --> 02:13.720]  money through monopolies. From Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world. He's not really,
[02:13.720 --> 02:22.480]  but he's one of the richest new money people in the world. It's just unbelievable. Unbelievable.
[02:22.480 --> 02:26.160]  I mean, there's a State Department warning not to travel to Mexico and we're supposed
[02:26.160 --> 02:32.400]  to just collapse the border completely. I would rather Mexico have its own revolution
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.680]  of liberty for freedom, revolution of ideas.
[02:37.680 --> 02:41.200]  And I'd like to see them with a second amendment. I'd like to, or whatever the free people of
[02:41.200 --> 02:48.080]  Mexico developed. There's a new NRA video out that I saw last night. McBreen showed
[02:48.080 --> 02:52.200]  it to me. Well, you guys know it was Rob Do. Will you get Rob Do to give you that? I wanna
[02:52.200 --> 02:53.200]  play that later.
[02:53.200 --> 02:57.120]  He was showing it to me in his office where they show all the numbers. I already knew
[02:57.120 --> 03:00.600]  this. So when I saw it, I knew the NRA was telling the truth. They don't just watch the
[03:00.600 --> 03:03.880]  NRA and go, they're telling the truth. I already knew this. I've seen the numbers. A lot of
[03:03.880 --> 03:04.880]  you've seen them.
[03:04.880 --> 03:08.760]  But I wanna do maybe a nightly news report tonight on this. I wanna review their new
[03:08.760 --> 03:15.080]  ad and then show some more documentation that most of the guns the drug cartels are getting
[03:15.080 --> 03:26.280]  are full auto. Flown in by Wells Fargo, Wachovia and others on record in giant cargo planes.
[03:26.280 --> 03:32.240]  The Mexican cartels tend to like German weapons. I saw a statistic where half of them are German
[03:32.240 --> 03:39.560]  full auto heckler and coke and things. And so they've got grenade launchers, tanks, armored
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.160]  vehicles, rocket launchers, and full auto.
[03:44.160 --> 03:52.000]  I mean, Mexican drug cartels have heavy 50s, folks, full auto. You can't buy that. Hand
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.960]  grenades. They buy them from Europe, they buy them, the US military stuff gets down
[03:58.960 --> 04:07.800]  there, full auto M16s, full auto 308s, Reapers, you name it. And again, I as a gun aficionado
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.640]  who studies all this, I know this, but thank God the NRA is on this.
[04:12.640 --> 04:19.440]  They're now blaming the crime in Mexico on the Second Amendment. But I did look up some
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.080]  numbers. Guess who is getting guns in America? Because they can't get them in Mexico. And
[04:25.080 --> 04:29.560]  guess who is using them to defend themselves? And there's now vigilante groups all over
[04:29.560 --> 04:32.640]  Mexico restoring law and order.
[04:32.640 --> 04:38.480]  Guess who? Mexicans are coming here and getting shotguns and rifles and handguns to protect
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.560]  themselves, even though they're outgunned with American guns. So it's true, when Obama
[04:43.560 --> 04:49.120]  doesn't want Mexicans to get guns, it's just like he doesn't want Americans to have guns.
[04:49.120 --> 04:53.000]  That's what's going on. He's siding with the drug cartels and that pig government down
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.640]  there against the Mexican people having a right to defend their families.

[08:24.560 --> 08:48.440]  This song touches my very soul.
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.520]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm central we're here live, rebroadcast on many stations
[08:54.520 --> 09:06.240]  as well. XM166 I think tomorrow it goes to channel 244. The news websites are infowars.com
[09:06.240 --> 09:15.800]  and prisonplanet.com. I had quite an epiphany this morning while hiking with my son in the
[09:15.800 --> 09:23.560]  lush spring morning. And the epiphany is a thought I've had so many times but it hit
[09:23.560 --> 09:32.640]  me so hard and with such clarity that the reason I get so frustrated and so angry and
[09:32.640 --> 09:38.200]  almost describe my disgusted tyranny and globalist and bullies like that of claustrophobia because
[09:38.200 --> 09:39.200]  that's what it is.
[09:39.200 --> 09:47.200]  I want them off my back. I want them out of my life. I have so much love for beauty and
[09:47.200 --> 09:53.120]  innocence and goodness and that is what is all over the world. That is what dominates
[09:53.120 --> 10:01.420]  creation but evil has a hunger to be in control and so this paradox historically is always
[10:01.420 --> 10:10.340]  there and I just cry out for justice. I resonate for truth and I'm not up here saying I'm a
[10:10.340 --> 10:13.000]  high and mighty moral person because of that.
[10:13.000 --> 10:26.360]  I am just a natural man. I'm a simple man. But common sense and simpleness in this modern
[10:26.360 --> 10:35.840]  mad world is a revolutionary idea. And when you study reality, when you study governments
[10:35.840 --> 10:44.240]  and political systems like I do, no exaggeration, 18 hours a day. I even dream about political
[10:44.240 --> 10:47.800]  situations in the new world order.
[10:47.800 --> 10:51.680]  As many people do, things that you're focused on you dream about. Most coaches I know say
[10:51.680 --> 10:56.600]  they dream about coaching. They dream about games, whether it's basketball, golf, football,
[10:56.600 --> 11:07.700]  baseball. It's the same thing. I eat, drink and sleep veritas. I want veritas. And I just
[11:07.700 --> 11:18.940]  feel so incredibly empowered and just so appreciative of consciousness.
[11:18.940 --> 11:26.200]  And then I see people dumbed down. I see people misled. I see people who feel bad about themselves
[11:26.200 --> 11:34.240]  because Madison Avenue has taught them to feel inadequate. So that Madison Avenue can
[11:34.240 --> 11:41.400]  then sell them lies in the name of making you complete when it actually makes you even
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.280]  more incomplete.
[11:43.280 --> 11:50.420]  You were born complete. I mean, I was just thinking about how everything is incredible,
[11:50.420 --> 12:00.000]  how driving down the highway and seeing hawks on light poles and police cars flashing lights
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.180]  and cars, taillights fading in and out through the hills at night, what Robert Plant was
[12:06.180 --> 12:13.640]  just singing about and the breeze and how you'll catch the smell of flowers and just
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.900]  how magic everything is, how incredible it all is, how good it all is.
[12:18.900 --> 12:29.040]  I was exercising yesterday evening and I looked up and whatever they called the official White
[12:29.040 --> 12:35.000]  House helicopter, Marine One, I think is the name of it. And I guess Obama's here in two
[12:35.000 --> 12:42.680]  days so they had Marine One. And yesterday I'm sitting there, it's a pure blue sky, totally
[12:42.680 --> 12:43.680]  gorgeous.
[12:43.680 --> 12:52.260]  It's like six o'clock at night, I went and exercised and came back into the nightly news.
[12:52.260 --> 12:58.640]  And I'm there jogging through the woods and I hear this big helicopter and I look up over
[12:58.640 --> 13:05.840]  the hills and here comes Marine One and it flies right over me. And it was just such
[13:05.840 --> 13:14.840]  an assault. It was an alien Skynet globalist craft surveying and doing a test run for the
[13:14.840 --> 13:17.100]  emperor's arrival.
[13:17.100 --> 13:22.800]  And then the emperor is nothing but the great Oz projection. I am the great and powerful
[13:22.800 --> 13:27.180]  Oz. Yeah, that's the old Marine One we've got on screen for TV viewers. It's the new
[13:27.180 --> 13:32.040]  Blackhawk Marine One. Type in the new Blackhawk Marine One cuz it was a big Blackhawk but
[13:32.040 --> 13:40.280]  with the white top and the green bottom.
[13:40.280 --> 13:47.120]  And I just wanted to be away from it. And it brought to mind thousands of crystallized
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.480]  thoughts of just the stupid red carpets and the pageantry and none of it means anything.
[13:54.480 --> 13:59.960]  People say, well, Alex, if Hollywood and all this means nothing, then why have you gone
[13:59.960 --> 14:01.800]  and hung out with Hollywood stars and people?
[14:01.800 --> 14:06.640]  Well, I'll tell you, ten years ago, I was still not really into it, but it was interesting.
[14:06.640 --> 14:12.760]  But I'm certainly not into it now unless I respect someone and I think they're an interesting
[14:12.760 --> 14:18.920]  creative person. Yes, that's what I saw over Austin. The Blackhawk Marine One, United States
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.960]  of America. I couldn't read the United States, but I could see the white on the tail from
[14:22.960 --> 14:24.840]  seeing it until it said United States of America.
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.520]  It's kinda like a road sign, you can read it before it comes into view perfectly just
[14:28.520 --> 14:37.680]  by the outline. And it's all about how they're God. It's all about how they're above the
[14:37.680 --> 14:48.200]  law. I get these emails, I see the comments about, hey, so we have martial law in Boston.
[14:48.200 --> 14:55.760]  You people are nothing, you don't count. I read one of those YouTube comments yesterday.
[14:55.760 --> 14:59.960]  The police are the professionals, and that's been the attitude throughout history.
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.920]  The government is up on a pedestal and it's sovereign and it has rights and it's God and
[15:04.920 --> 15:11.760]  you're scum. That's how 98% of other governments, conservatively, you can count on one hand
[15:11.760 --> 15:23.960]  so quasi-free societies. Quasi-free. And they were usually societies that came out of incredible
[15:23.960 --> 15:32.240]  tyranny that was so horrible, people codified basic human rights that were in stone, punishable
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.400]  by death if you violated them, because it's so dangerous to turn the worst people loose
[15:37.400 --> 15:42.560]  in society in a tyranny. That's how tyranny works.
[15:42.560 --> 15:46.520]  You get rid of the checks and balances, the worst in the society will take control. And
[15:46.520 --> 15:55.720]  I started thinking about how they had the FBI counter-terrorism deputy director on CNN.
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.120]  I played the clip yesterday. Go and listen, we record everything you do. We can go back
[16:01.120 --> 16:09.040]  in time and hear everything the Czarnev brothers said. The dead Patsy Tamerlan and the other
[16:09.040 --> 16:16.080]  one. And he smiled about it with pleasure in an egomaniac, criminal energy, hiking
[16:16.080 --> 16:20.040]  the leg, urinating on us, criminology display.
[16:20.040 --> 16:25.300]  I mean, I've seen the look in the serial killers in the dock at trials. I've seen the look
[16:25.300 --> 16:31.200]  of criminals. I've been in juvenile multiple times until I got out on trial in fights.
[16:31.200 --> 16:37.920]  I've been around criminals, ladies and gentlemen. And I know the look in their eye, the enjoyment
[16:37.920 --> 16:43.000]  in cheating people, in lying to people, in getting things over on them. And I saw it
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.620]  in that FBI agent's eyes, the enjoyment, how they can go back and pull up.
[16:47.620 --> 16:52.860]  Years of every phone call we made, recordings of it, not just the text. And everything you
[16:52.860 --> 16:58.700]  do recorded on record. That was known back in the Telecommunications Act of 96. That's
[16:58.700 --> 17:03.320]  how dumb they think you are. And I'm the conspiracy theory person for telling you things that
[17:03.320 --> 17:04.440]  are admitted fact.
[17:04.440 --> 17:15.280]  That is flaming criminality. It's to keep us safe from Adam Gadon, the grandson of the
[17:15.280 --> 17:30.880]  head of the ADL, formally. And then the other four leaders of Al-Qaeda are all US-born trained
[17:30.880 --> 17:36.100]  known CIA operatives. I'm like, if there's a drill, if they're on CIA payroll, if they've
[17:36.100 --> 17:39.580]  been protected, if they've got a history with the FBI, it's a staged event.
[17:39.580 --> 17:44.080]  Look at the drill they had, which they admit they had but now won't talk about. And then
[17:44.080 --> 17:51.100]  all and then, how did I just guess minutes after it happened in overdrive that Monday
[17:51.100 --> 17:57.720]  with Richard Belzer on the show that it'll be people connected to the CIA and FBI protected.
[17:57.720 --> 18:02.320]  And there'll be a drill, and there'll be a stand down, and then they'll kill the patsies
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.440]  or cut the other ones throat out.
[18:05.440 --> 18:10.360]  Because they run the same blueprint. By the way, I've got to, before I get into all this
[18:10.360 --> 18:17.040]  big news, I've got to apologize. I just read the Wikipedia entry on Iron Man, and it turns
[18:17.040 --> 18:23.760]  out there was a last minute re-edit, which I confirmed through our reporters in LA.
[18:23.760 --> 18:32.640]  And I went and saw Iron Man last night, and it was very cartoonish, very stupid at the
[18:32.640 --> 18:45.780]  end, still entertaining. And I went and saw the film, and they openly tell you that defense
[18:45.780 --> 18:51.920]  contractors are staging the terror attacks and running the Pentagon program to counter
[18:51.920 --> 18:52.920]  the terrorist.
[18:52.920 --> 18:59.520]  And they go, it's supply and demand, we run all sides, it's full spectrum dominance. Now,
[18:59.520 --> 19:05.360]  no one else has said that but me. I mean, sure, we know governments for 200, 300 years
[19:05.360 --> 19:09.200]  have been funding both sides. The Rothschilds have been doing it, big banks have been doing
[19:09.200 --> 19:10.200]  it.
[19:10.200 --> 19:17.440]  That's a well known system. But they actually say in the movie, it's full spectrum dominance.
[19:17.440 --> 19:22.200]  We create the terrorism and then we also make the money off fighting it. It's supply and
[19:22.200 --> 19:30.280]  demand. And then there's a false flag and Bin Laden is an actor in it. And I don't even
[19:30.280 --> 19:41.640]  know what to say anymore. Yeah, Mandarin. But the problem is I walk out of the theater
[19:41.640 --> 19:43.880]  and I hear everybody going, I didn't understand that.

[21:09.120 --> 21:14.440]  in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.

[24:14.920 --> 24:18.840]  You know what? I'm going to get to the off the chart news in the next segment. I want
[24:18.840 --> 24:26.360]  to continue talking about the world outside of globalist control a little bit. Then I'm
[24:26.360 --> 24:34.800]  going to get to danger. Google warns Drudge Report and Info Wars are malware. Dan Pfeiffer,
[24:34.800 --> 24:38.920]  senior advisor of the White House told the public and the media, do not visit the Drudge
[24:38.920 --> 24:44.000]  Report because it's helping expose the fact that they're overthrowing the Bill of Rights
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.400]  and Constitution, putting our military under UN control, buying billions of bullets.
[24:49.400 --> 24:55.060]  And now Google is lying and saying that we have malware. We've scanned the site. This
[24:55.060 --> 24:59.760]  is not on our site. They are liars. They did this to Drudge a few years ago. It came out,
[24:59.760 --> 25:06.300]  it was a lie. And Google is the ultimate hack. Worldwide, they've been caught from France
[25:06.300 --> 25:12.920]  to the US, from Canada to Australia with Google cars driving around with antennas on them,
[25:12.920 --> 25:15.480]  hacking your computer and hard hacking it.
[25:15.480 --> 25:20.120]  It's a felony each time. If you or I did this, you're talking years in jail. Breaking into
[25:20.120 --> 25:25.520]  your computer, stealing everything on it, stealing your passcodes, everything. In fact,
[25:25.520 --> 25:34.680]  guys, print me a bunch of articles on it. I know Kurt linked to them, but I want to
[25:34.680 --> 25:41.120]  show TV viewers actually articles. Just type in Google hacks computers, Google broke into
[25:41.120 --> 25:47.000]  computers with Google car. I mean, this is the ultimate malware, ultimate surveillance
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.160]  when you're on Google and you set your settings.
[25:50.160 --> 25:53.260]  In fact, get me, Catherine Albrecht, back on about Google. I want to do a whole show
[25:53.260 --> 25:57.420]  on them. There it is. Business Insider, Google caught secretly hacking Apple software to
[25:57.420 --> 26:01.500]  track people, iPhone and Mac users. Yeah, that's nothing. Print that too. No, no, no.
[26:01.500 --> 26:06.340]  They hack your actual computer with Google cars. Google cars caught hacking. I'm already
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.860]  getting into this. I said I'd get into it in the next segment.
[26:08.860 --> 26:15.880]  This is the ultimate hacking group. And it turns out when they said Drudge was hacking
[26:15.880 --> 26:20.680]  people or Drudge had malware two years ago, this is in Kurt's article linked to mainstream
[26:20.680 --> 26:31.600]  news. Turns out it was Google's own software in the ad packages run by a third party that
[26:31.600 --> 26:34.020]  they said was spying on people.
[26:34.020 --> 26:37.920]  So I'm gonna explain that again. That's just like our government funds Al-Qaeda to attack
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.420]  countries and they give them heat seeking missiles. And then we've got to give our rights
[26:41.420 --> 26:48.280]  up because Al-Qaeda has got heat seeking missiles. And that's like Google is spying on you.
[26:48.280 --> 26:52.560]  But then on its ad software that they buy up every, we've used like three different
[26:52.560 --> 26:57.000]  companies to serve our ads. Google's bought every one of them. They just bought the last
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.640]  company we're now using. So we've got to find another one.
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.660]  So the only thing our IT people think this may be is that again, because we've got some
[27:05.660 --> 27:11.400]  Google software running on one part of things that they're now blocking us because they
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.200]  have a freaking monopoly on ad software. I mean, I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I have
[27:16.200 --> 27:18.960]  trouble dealing with this level of hypocrisy.
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.520]  Google is sued by dozens of customers after snooping on 10 million iPads. Yeah, that's
[27:22.520 --> 27:28.000]  just the latest, guys. Print me all that. Two years ago, they had to plead guilty, I
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.280]  think it was in France, but they've also got caught doing it here. Google hacks computers,
[27:33.280 --> 27:37.360]  steals passcodes with Google cars.
[27:37.360 --> 27:41.720]  It's the Google cars that go around taking the photos. They got an antenna. Did Google
[27:41.720 --> 27:48.520]  get off easy with 7 million for wise spy settlement? Yeah, there it is. You see a Google car driving
[27:48.520 --> 27:55.640]  around? It ain't just taking photos, jack of your house, okay? That is an NSA globalist
[27:55.640 --> 28:04.920]  imperial probe droid. That's the same thing. That's the same thing the smart meters are.
[28:04.920 --> 28:08.920]  They bragged 15 years ago, they were gonna put, quote, smart meters on your house. You
[28:08.920 --> 28:10.360]  hear smart, you better run.
[28:10.360 --> 28:16.560]  And all the new appliances, from coasters to clock radios to washing machines, all of
[28:16.560 --> 28:20.320]  them watch and listen and track everything you're doing. And now they say, we are gonna
[28:20.320 --> 28:24.280]  control the heat in your house. I remember reading about that 10 years ago and people
[28:24.280 --> 28:26.120]  are like, you kook, they're not gonna control the temp.
[28:26.120 --> 28:32.120]  Then they come out to yours and go, we actually are gonna control your thermostat. I mean,
[28:32.120 --> 28:38.400]  if that isn't malware hacking, and now I'm getting these reports everywhere. And I've
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.600]  just been so busy, I told IT to look into it. And now Kurt finds out about it cuz it's
[28:42.600 --> 28:50.800]  in the news, that Google is lying and saying, we're putting malware on you. So you don't
[28:50.800 --> 28:59.320]  go to infoawards.com when they are, if I'm a sinner, they're Satan.
[28:59.320 --> 29:06.240]  This is Satan saying I'm evil. Well, get behind me, Google. Get behind me, Satan, Beelzebub,
[29:06.240 --> 29:14.320]  Baphomet, Leviathan. In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, get behind me,
[29:14.320 --> 29:20.760]  Google. NSA, NSA who says don't be evil.
[29:20.760 --> 29:24.840]  What a joke. I'm gonna get to that more later. I wanna talk more about the universe and how
[29:24.840 --> 29:27.560]  these people are not God, even though they wanna act like it. They just showed me one
[29:27.560 --> 29:31.640]  of the Google cars, all these antennas and camera pods and wiring off of it. But it's
[29:31.640 --> 29:36.440]  like Google. Oh, they have beer and pinball. They have a Google movie coming out. They're
[29:36.440 --> 29:44.020]  non-threatening. Warren Buffett's got an ice cream cone. Bill Gates loves children. I'm
[29:44.020 --> 29:47.240]  telling you, if you dressed up in an ice cream man outfit, you can stick babies in a blender
[29:47.240 --> 29:50.240]  and women would help you do it cuz it's trendy and liberal.
[29:50.240 --> 30:01.400]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:01.400 --> 30:05.980]  Introduce I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting
[30:05.980 --> 30:11.040]  weights and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals
[30:11.040 --> 30:16.280]  and trace elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could
[30:16.280 --> 30:21.440]  eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied. Now there are hundreds of great
[30:21.440 --> 30:26.080]  products at info wars team.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me
[30:26.080 --> 30:34.960]  lose 37 pounds in just two months. Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland burst
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.440]  and rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I
[30:39.440 --> 30:44.920]  lost more than 37 pounds in just two months. Now that's results. I want to challenge my
[30:44.920 --> 30:50.760]  listeners to go to info wars team.com and order just three of their products and you
[30:50.760 --> 30:56.560]  will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.

[31:32.720 --> 31:37.360]  on synthetic gelling agents which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[31:37.360 --> 31:42.360]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry
[31:42.360 --> 31:47.520]  of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more

[32:03.440 --> 32:09.160]  seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing
[32:09.160 --> 32:13.680]  us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country

[32:18.100 --> 32:23.140]  you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up

[33:17.600 --> 33:32.940]  is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem. Spoken like a hardcore extremist.
[33:32.940 --> 33:39.640]  Spoken like an American. Tell all of you something, you didn't build nothing. In fact, your parents
[33:39.640 --> 33:44.860]  didn't create you. A government immaculate conception happened. A little vampire bat
[33:44.860 --> 33:51.760]  flew in the window, climbed on top your mama. That's where you came from. You are the seed
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.200]  of government. They are our God and King. And you know, I could sit there and joke about
[33:56.200 --> 34:01.180]  that, but government wants to become God. The globalists want to become God. GMO is
[34:01.180 --> 34:06.720]  taking over all the real original crops and replacing it with toxic death and poison that
[34:06.720 --> 34:10.920]  sterilizes every mammal that comes in contact with it long term.
[34:10.920 --> 34:16.060]  But they are not God. Let me finish up with a Google story, then I'll get into the fact
[34:16.060 --> 34:19.860]  that they are not in total control and the new world order is dead on arrival and they
[34:19.860 --> 34:25.480]  will fail if humanity rises to the challenge. But let me just show you the article. Punch
[34:25.480 --> 34:30.960]  this up for TV viewers, radio listeners, go to info wars.com. And I've had Kurt update
[34:30.960 --> 34:36.640]  his article and add a bunch of news articles admitting that Google is the ultimate criminal
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.400]  spy breaking into your computer, committing mass felonies.
[34:40.400 --> 34:45.920]  But it's a government cutout, just like Total Information Awareness Network set up by the
[34:45.920 --> 34:52.980]  CIA via In-Q-Tel funding. When I first reported that 10 years ago with the CIA, former technology
[34:52.980 --> 35:01.120]  expert at the CIA, Steele, Mr. Steele, forget his first name, you can look it up. The media
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.700]  flipped and said it was a conspiracy theory and he got threatened and wouldn't come back
[35:04.700 --> 35:05.980]  on the show after that.
[35:05.980 --> 35:12.880]  Now it's been declassified. Look up Google, In-Q-Tel. They're just given the spy satellite
[35:12.880 --> 35:19.740]  data. They're just given, they're based at the NASA headquarters, the real NASA headquarters,
[35:19.740 --> 35:26.240]  the clandestine operations. And what does Google say? They say don't visit infowars.com,
[35:26.240 --> 35:33.040]  don't visit prisonplanet.com. And the reason I tell you this is you better appreciate infowars.com
[35:33.040 --> 35:37.200]  and prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.360]  You better appreciate drudgereport.com because the White House and the globalist are on record
[35:42.360 --> 35:48.960]  trying to pass Soviet or communist style Internet censorship. That's their words. Even CBS News,
[35:48.960 --> 35:54.480]  CNET had to call it Chinese style and Russian style censorship, okay? Remember the White
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.800]  House Chief Advisor to Obama said don't go to drudge.
[35:58.800 --> 36:02.800]  And again, they think they're God, don't go to that. And let me tell you, the general
[36:02.800 --> 36:07.400]  public goes, well, that's crazy, I'm gonna go there. No, they tell the press corps that,
[36:07.400 --> 36:11.800]  they know. You go there and you quote anything off of that, even though it's mainly mainstream
[36:11.800 --> 36:15.040]  news, we control the narrative.
[36:15.040 --> 36:18.040]  We wanna be able to tell people what the top news story is on every news channel every
[36:18.040 --> 36:22.160]  night, you see that. Well, Drudge isn't with the program, Infowars isn't with the program.
[36:22.160 --> 36:32.200]  So he says, you don't go there, prostitutes. And they say, hile Obama, literally. And they
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.120]  don't, I mean, the FBI tells the press, you listen here, you don't look at any other photos
[36:36.120 --> 36:37.120]  of that drill.
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.220]  You don't look at these man's photos over here. And the press, all 100 plus people in
[36:41.220 --> 36:44.960]  there with Dan Badonti did not go over and look at it. And they sent shaved head guys
[36:44.960 --> 36:49.320]  over to bump into him and get in his face and threatening. And he said, I'm not scared
[36:49.320 --> 36:52.480]  of you, I know you guys are involved in this.
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.880]  And boy, let me tell you, the look of intimidation and power went out of their eyes. I've seen
[36:56.880 --> 37:01.680]  the video, you've seen the video. When he said, I don't care what you do, I'm done,
[37:01.680 --> 37:06.040]  I know, and boy, they know deep down too. If they weren't actually there involved in
[37:06.040 --> 37:12.000]  it, they know what it is. You don't have power putting on a uniform or putting on a suit
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.520]  and serving Mordor and imagining you're part of it.
[37:15.520 --> 37:21.080]  All you are is a sucker when you do that. And I'm gonna tell you, none of you are gonna
[37:21.080 --> 37:26.160]  make it out of this new world order. None of us, if this thing comes in, if this thing
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.760]  actually gets on its feet, and it's starting to try to get up from a crouching position,
[37:30.760 --> 37:31.760]  it's been crawling.
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.840]  And let me tell you, it's scary as a baby. Well, it's now a little boy, and it's now
[37:36.840 --> 37:40.720]  getting strong, and it's now sucking a lot of blood out of a lot of countries, and a
[37:40.720 --> 37:45.280]  lot of ideas, a lot of science out of people. And it wants every stinking one of us dead
[37:45.280 --> 37:53.080]  six feet under. The New World Order is on a power trip and thinks it's God.
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.840]  And I know I'm right, I've read all their writings. And I sit there and I talk to GQ
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.400]  writers and Esquire writers and all of them. And they're just like, you can't really believe
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.640]  this is real, you don't really believe they're doing this. And I'm like, I don't believe
[38:07.640 --> 38:14.760]  it, I know it.
[38:14.760 --> 38:18.400]  And in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act, as Orwell
[38:18.400 --> 38:25.040]  said. And I forget who said in the, I think it was a Dutch philosopher, look it up for
[38:25.040 --> 38:30.280]  me, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. When I say that, I see comments
[38:30.280 --> 38:33.040]  on YouTube going, how dare you bash blind people?
[38:33.040 --> 38:37.560]  Is that how politically correct you are? You have no thought process but to say any knowledge
[38:37.560 --> 38:41.900]  is politically correct, like an idiocracy when the guy gets up and says, I wanna put
[38:41.900 --> 38:50.340]  on a defense, I'm not guilty. And they go, what are you, a fag? What are you, gay? That's
[38:50.340 --> 38:53.800]  the words they use when anybody, I've seen it.
[38:53.800 --> 38:59.680]  What are you doing reading a book? You read too many books. What are you, a fag? I've
[38:59.680 --> 39:05.600]  actually had people tell me that before it was put in a bureaucracy. And I bet you money
[39:05.600 --> 39:08.560]  we're gonna be able to ask him. I was talking to him yesterday, I should've asked him that.
[39:08.560 --> 39:13.520]  Mike Judge, I'll guarantee you, he put that in that movie because he, I'll bet money when
[39:13.520 --> 39:22.720]  I ask him because he's seen that happen. Erasmus, and where was he? He was Dutch, right? Erasmus,
[39:22.720 --> 39:29.920]  in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[39:29.920 --> 39:37.080]  Dutch, Dutch philosopher Erasmus, Dutch Renaissance. You wanna know who I am, New World Order?
[39:37.080 --> 39:42.320]  I am Renaissance. You wanna know who I am, New World Order? I am enlightenment. You know
[39:42.320 --> 39:48.880]  who I am? I am freedom. You know who I am? I am compassion. I am justice. I am honor.
[39:48.880 --> 39:57.280]  I am duty. I am will. I am commitment. I am love. I am truthfulness. Does that mean I
[39:57.280 --> 40:01.680]  don't have my evil side? I certainly got it. I got a big good side and I got a big evil
[40:01.680 --> 40:02.680]  side.
[40:02.680 --> 40:07.320]  But my good side is a lot bigger than my evil side. And you know what? I'm a mile wide and
[40:07.320 --> 40:16.720]  a trillion miles deep. And so are you. So are you. And you only live when you commit
[40:16.720 --> 40:22.440]  to good. That's when the universe opens up to you, all these people serving evil, training
[40:22.440 --> 40:35.060]  in evil, thinking you'll gain power from evil. You will not gain power from evil. Because
[40:35.060 --> 40:39.220]  you aren't individually resonating with anything good.
[40:39.220 --> 40:55.240]  You are tying into something destructive. Before there was the light, there was darkness.
[40:55.240 --> 40:59.040]  And you're gonna see more of this. This is how the globalists have said that they're
[40:59.040 --> 41:09.160]  going to censor the Internet. They have said they're going to censor the Internet by claiming
[41:09.160 --> 41:15.560]  that all sites not affiliated with the globalist in subdomains are malware or scams.
[41:15.560 --> 41:18.360]  They're gonna block you from them. And they're gonna tax the web and they're gonna form a
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.960]  new web. Google's putting it in 100 times faster than the rest. And you will have no
[41:22.960 --> 41:28.000]  freedom when you're on that new web. You will be in subdomains and waive your rights. And
[41:28.000 --> 41:29.760]  they want everybody to be in that.
[41:29.760 --> 41:33.600]  They wanna be dominant. That's why they've let YouTube be somewhat free and other platforms.
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.200]  What they've said, that's all going away. So we've built prisonplanet.tv to fight the
[41:38.200 --> 41:42.760]  prison planet. We are trying to build our own operations. We're trying to build our
[41:42.760 --> 41:49.560]  own infrastructure. We're putting out print media to begin that development. They are
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.240]  going to try to shut us down, but they can't do it.
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.800]  If you know they wanna shut us down, and if you'll tell everybody about infowars.com.
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.440]  I'm telling you, folks, they're scared of infowars.com and they're scared of drudgerport.com.
[42:02.440 --> 42:09.680]  And I've told you this and now you're seeing them come out with it. Group calls for hearings
[42:09.680 --> 42:18.040]  into Google's CIA ties and NSA. Robert David Steele in 2006 first told our broadcast they
[42:18.040 --> 42:19.880]  were CIA funded by In-Q-Tel.
[42:19.880 --> 42:29.920]  It's since been declassified. And to have them come out and say we have malware on our
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.080]  site when we don't. Let me read you the article. They did this as a drudge in 2010, two and
[42:35.080 --> 42:43.200]  a half years ago. Turned out it was Google's own software on an ad, on a link he linked
[42:43.200 --> 42:50.940]  to. And the last time they said this with us, it wasn't even the news, we looked at
[42:50.940 --> 42:51.940]  it was Google.
[42:51.940 --> 42:55.640]  So we got away from Google and then Google bought the company we went with. And then
[42:55.640 --> 42:59.400]  Google bought the next company and then Google just bought the other company. You understand
[42:59.400 --> 43:07.760]  they've got a near monopoly over ad server systems. Drudge Report accused of serving
[43:07.760 --> 43:14.640]  malware again, CNET News.
[43:14.640 --> 43:20.240]  The White House says don't go there. Let me read to you the article today, danger. Google
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.400]  warns Drudge Report and infowars.com are malware. An effort to scare folks away from alternative
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.680]  media. I don't know why he puts a question mark on it. Maybe we should change that sub
[43:31.680 --> 43:40.040]  headline to, this is the ultimate in fraud because Google is the biggest hacker malware
[43:40.040 --> 43:43.440]  scamming criminal group in the Internet history.
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.680]  And that's conservative. I mean, it's like two or three times when anybody else has done.
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.160]  I just computed it. It's probably 100 times. I mean, they are the king of it. I'm gonna
[43:54.160 --> 43:59.880]  go over that. And everybody should go over the fact of what they're doing.
[43:59.880 --> 44:05.240]  Facebook's a big CIA pump it up scam where they call their users dumb efforts and how
[44:05.240 --> 44:10.280]  they're scamming you and charging you to send messages and people committing suicide over
[44:10.280 --> 44:17.480]  it. I mean, who cares? Use it like a toilet. Use Facebook to jack their system and jack
[44:17.480 --> 44:18.480]  them hard.
[44:18.480 --> 44:23.340]  But hate them and spit on them while you do it. Same thing with YouTube, all of it. Jack
[44:23.340 --> 44:29.320]  the enemy conduits, jack it hard and hate them and spit on them while you do it. It's
[44:29.320 --> 44:34.840]  a war. They're killing kids everywhere with GMO and vaccines knowingly. This morning they
[44:34.840 --> 44:38.280]  had jets out spraying chemtrails everywhere.
[44:38.280 --> 44:44.120]  It's a public geoengineering program, partially declassified and the public doesn't even know
[44:44.120 --> 44:50.480]  about it. You think you're in Kansas, you're not in Kansas anymore. All you can do is make
[44:50.480 --> 44:54.360]  the decision to look into what were the CIA admits full monitoring of Facebook, Google,
[44:54.360 --> 44:55.360]  YouTube and other social networks.
[44:55.360 --> 45:01.080]  Yeah, you run them. If you're a radio listener, we're showing headlines. An effort to scare
[45:01.080 --> 45:06.480]  folks away from alternative media. Editors note infowars.com IT department has scanned
[45:06.480 --> 45:12.760]  our system and reports that we do not carry content from umequeds.com as Google tells
[45:12.760 --> 45:14.480]  visitors our site.
[45:14.480 --> 45:19.200]  How best to scare people away from alternative media? How about real media? Make them think
[45:19.200 --> 45:24.680]  Drudge Report and Infowars web pages contain malicious software. Again, this is Google,
[45:24.680 --> 45:29.620]  the ultimate criminal group. In April, White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer tried to
[45:29.620 --> 45:31.240]  steer traffic away from Drudge Report.
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.760]  Of course, it spiked. His effort directed more traffic to the website. They might actually
[45:36.760 --> 45:41.640]  put a link to Alexa to show that. And then it goes on with the message. Google Chrome
[45:41.640 --> 45:49.160]  has blocked access to DrudgeReport.com. Content from uquads.com and known malware distributor
[45:49.160 --> 45:53.600]  has been inserted into your web page. Visit this page now is very likely to infect your
[45:53.600 --> 45:57.980]  computer total bull. I mean, Google is the one jacking and breaking through your pass
[45:57.980 --> 46:00.440]  codes and spying.
[46:00.440 --> 46:05.200]  And Schmidt says you shouldn't visit anything you don't want me to see on a power trip.
[46:05.200 --> 46:11.500]  I mean, what a joke. By the way, he only sold last time I saw like 10,000 of his book. What
[46:11.500 --> 46:18.180]  a joke you are scumbag. Just because you can run a criminal CIA front doesn't mean you
[46:18.180 --> 46:24.280]  actually ever did anything, little man. Hope you're cozy under the black wings of the New
[46:24.280 --> 46:25.280]  World Order.
[46:25.280 --> 46:36.360]  We'll see how that works out for you. Mark Zuckerberg awarded CIA surveillance medal.
[46:36.360 --> 46:42.600]  Wow, I can't handle it. Get him off my screen, it makes me too sick. Some soft punk. So sick
[46:42.600 --> 46:49.360]  of all these punks. Malware is malicious software that causes things like identity theft, financial
[46:49.360 --> 46:53.480]  loss and permanent file deletion.
[46:53.480 --> 47:00.020]  So imagine they're telling people that if you go to info wars.com, you could have identity
[47:00.020 --> 47:04.920]  theft when it's the big banks and government on record that are over 90% of the identity
[47:04.920 --> 47:11.760]  theft problems with the software and data and social security leaks. That's on record.
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.520]  But here they are, the ones that do it, the ones that break into your computer saying
[47:15.520 --> 47:22.300]  we did it. They're desperate, it's not gonna work. Everyone go to info wars.com. Everyone
[47:22.300 --> 47:24.040]  tell your friends and family.
[47:24.040 --> 47:28.560]  Support us, buy the water filters, the t-shirts, subscribe to the magazine, fill our war chest
[47:28.560 --> 47:34.600]  and I will wage war on the enemy as hardcore as I can. During a news conference last year,
[47:34.600 --> 47:38.080]  White House Press Secretary Jake Carney instructed a reporter, be mindful of your sources when
[47:38.080 --> 47:40.300]  asked about the Drudge Report.
[47:40.300 --> 47:43.640]  More traffic followed the Drudge. Despite the best efforts of Obama Knights and Democrats
[47:43.640 --> 47:48.560]  to dis Drudge and put a dent in the web's popularity, millions of folks pursue the site
[47:48.560 --> 47:54.040]  daily. Back in March of 2010, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works sent an email
[47:54.040 --> 48:00.240]  stating Drudge's website was responsible for many viruses popping up throughout the Senate.
[48:00.240 --> 48:05.000]  CNN reported that it turned out it wasn't true. No appreciable drop in viewership ensued.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.960]  Dido info wars.com. See, we're getting taken direct shots from these people. In recent
[48:09.960 --> 48:13.600]  weeks, a large number of critics led by spurious reports posted by the southern poverty law
[48:13.600 --> 48:17.760]  center's website and elsewhere have posted stories accusing Alex Jones and info wars.com
[48:17.760 --> 48:23.320]  of fomenting some kind of right wing terror campaign and distributing baseless conspiracy
[48:23.320 --> 48:24.320]  theories.
[48:24.320 --> 48:27.680]  No matter following the attack, millions of people flock to the website to get their other
[48:27.680 --> 48:33.320]  side of the story on everything from Sandy Hook to the Boston bombings. Now Google Chrome
[48:33.320 --> 48:42.200]  tags info wars.com as a malware distributor. Unbelievable, it is a tactic destined to failure.
[48:42.200 --> 48:47.720]  Yeah, but in the new web, they're just gonna block us. In a CNET article in March of 2010
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.080]  reported that malware allegedly distributed by Drudge report actually came, wait for it,
[48:53.080 --> 49:04.120]  actually came from DoubleClick, a subsidiary of goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo. Can anybody
[49:04.120 --> 49:10.500]  say goo goo goo goo goo goo goo goo?
[49:10.500 --> 49:18.960]  It rhymes with Obama, Obama. Again, who runs Al-Qaeda, NATO, and the big banks publicly?
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.080]  Why do they take our rights? Cuz of Al-Qaeda. Why has Drudge got malware, which he didn't?
[49:24.080 --> 49:31.900]  Cuz Google. Google was implanting it in links. Articles he was linking to doing them a favor.
[49:31.900 --> 49:37.160]  He was sending them money. And what do they do for him sending them traffic? Why they
[49:37.160 --> 49:40.240]  lie about him and they do the same thing to us.
[49:40.240 --> 49:48.200]  What a pack of scum and filth and garbage. Read the CNET article, we're linked to it.
[49:48.200 --> 49:55.160]  Google reported on Drudge because of Google. I mean, I know we drink a lot of fluoride
[49:55.160 --> 50:00.400]  out there, folks, but I mean, are you getting the irony here? I mean, this is some satire
[50:00.400 --> 50:07.880]  here. But it's real that Google is, I mean, this is incredible.
[50:07.880 --> 50:14.520]  It should be satire, but it's not. It's absurdist. It goes on that the Federal Communications
[50:14.520 --> 50:17.920]  Commission documented and disclosed that Google's street view and effort to photograph streets,
[50:17.920 --> 50:21.760]  that was the cover around the world, literally collected massive amounts of Wi-Fi payload
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.280]  data, including breaking into bank accounts, I should add, and that information was illegally
[50:25.280 --> 50:27.560]  stored on Oregon storage facility.
[50:27.560 --> 50:31.640]  Google attempted to hide the theft from the public and investigators. Did they go to jail
[50:31.640 --> 50:39.440]  for absconding? Like you or I wouldn't know. And we have a bunch of links to Google's criminal
[50:39.440 --> 50:47.960]  activity. They've declared war on us. I declare info war on scumbag Google. I declare info
[50:47.960 --> 50:55.720]  war on the entire scumbag New World Order. And I demand humanity activate emergency survival
[50:55.720 --> 51:01.720]  genetic code now. Activate.
[51:01.720 --> 51:07.320]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird

[53:04.760 --> 53:09.960]  Curious about what comes next? Next is the feeling of vulnerability you get after you
[53:09.960 --> 53:15.080]  arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars. Fool the bad guys with
[53:15.080 --> 53:21.640]  a new, improved fake TV. You asked for it. We listened, and we made our new fake TV three
[53:21.640 --> 53:26.160]  times brighter than our previous model. The brightness of our new fake TV is equivalent
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.320]  to a 40 inch TV. It simulates the color and motion of a real TV while you're away from
[53:32.320 --> 53:37.080]  home. And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass
[53:37.080 --> 53:42.960]  your house and move on to an easier target. The new, brighter fake TV is only $39.95 and
[53:42.960 --> 53:54.200]  includes free shipping. Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388. Or
[53:54.200 --> 54:15.560]  go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent. Every little thing you do, every person you
[54:15.560 --> 54:21.760]  talk to, every person you warn, every time you resist, every time you fight a ticket,
[54:21.760 --> 54:29.040]  every time you speak out against the system, the enemy, like a sandcastle with waves coming
[54:29.040 --> 54:35.840]  ever closer, begins to crumble into the sea.
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.900]  This is epic. This is history. You're on a planet in a gorgeous universe. Men and women
[54:40.900 --> 54:52.680]  come together and create a genetic splice clone that is a baby that you then take care
[54:52.680 --> 55:01.720]  of. We live on a tiny sliver thinner than the skin of an apple in comparison of oxygen,
[55:01.720 --> 55:10.680]  about 14,000 feet of breathable oxygen in a tiny little sliver on this natural or the
[55:10.680 --> 55:21.560]  Bible says it's not. Space Station, perfectly placed with a perfectly placed moon. In the
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.520]  middle of wonderment and the great crime is having to be obsessed all day with these crooks
[55:27.520 --> 55:34.160]  and the scum trying to play God and they're so demonic that those of us that are awake,
[55:34.160 --> 55:37.760]  we laugh at them like they're demonic children, but they're in control cuz they lust after
[55:37.760 --> 55:44.920]  it. So we've got to get them out of control and restore checks and balances in the Republic.
[55:44.920 --> 55:48.960]  Take Central Texas, San Antonio and Austin. There's over 80,000 copies of my magazine
[55:48.960 --> 55:52.800]  on the streets there. You can buy these in bulk of groups of 10 up to 100. They've got
[55:52.800 --> 55:58.400]  three bumper stickers, full size, petroleum based, the kind that last years. Big info
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.260]  wars.com for the Constitution bumper stickers inside of it. It's the false flags issue.
[56:03.260 --> 56:07.320]  Great to wake somebody up. I want everybody, especially in Central Texas and San Antonio
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.640]  and Austin, I guess that's North South Texas, San Antonio, to get them and to put it on
[56:11.640 --> 56:16.840]  your cars and wherever else is legal and lawful. Certainly don't do what the French Resistance
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.720]  did and stick it up in public. We should worship the government. The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.160]  that I wanna see these.
[56:24.160 --> 56:27.480]  These are on the streets of Austin right now, everywhere. You're already seeing bumper stickers
[56:27.480 --> 56:34.640]  every 50th car or so, but I want them all over the country. You can also buy bumper
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.520]  stickers at info wars.com. I mean, you understand, we have crawled up from nowhere because of
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.260]  your support and been able to put up this fight.
[56:42.260 --> 56:46.580]  And there aren't many of us fighting, but we're having huge devastating victories when
[56:46.580 --> 56:53.560]  we do. If you get involved and join the team and come in for the big win, we're gonna beat
[56:53.560 --> 56:59.040]  these people. What they're doing is totally illegal. They're flaunting on TV that everything
[56:59.040 --> 57:01.280]  you do is recorded on your phone.
[57:01.280 --> 57:06.800]  They have an FBI deputy director of counterterrorism on TV smiling, going, we record everything
[57:06.800 --> 57:12.880]  you say, everything you do, America. And he goes, we can't use it in criminal cases yet,
[57:12.880 --> 57:19.840]  but we are. And that means they can make stuff up. They had programs out a decade ago where
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.280]  you can record someone's voice, put it into a computer, and have it say whatever you want.
[57:24.280 --> 57:31.080]  And another computer can't tell it's fake. 20 years ago, they could show you Forrest
[57:31.080 --> 57:37.200]  Gump shaking hands with Kennedy. It ain't real, folks. They even produce al-Qaeda videos
[57:37.200 --> 57:45.640]  at the Pentagon and put the al-Qaeda logo in the same character generator layer.
[57:45.640 --> 57:56.400]  Wired Magazine confirmed that, National Security Agency flipped out. That was five years ago.
[57:56.400 --> 58:04.040]  The al-Qaeda videos with the al-Qaeda logos, those are produced by the Pentagon. They shot
[58:04.040 --> 58:10.280]  them on a sound stage. You're like, that's Iron Man 3, dude, you're ripping off the movie.
[58:10.280 --> 58:16.960]  No, I told you that before 9-11. I told you they'd blow up the World Trade Center, blame
[58:16.960 --> 58:25.120]  it on their asset, bin Laden. It's not the US government. It's not our troops, our boys.
[58:25.120 --> 58:30.680]  It's the New World Order. And they don't want you to know about any of this. But if all
[58:30.680 --> 58:36.120]  of you do little things, we outnumber them 10,000 to one.
[58:36.120 --> 58:38.120]  The Claire Info War today.
[58:38.120 --> 58:51.560]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:51.560 --> 58:57.160]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[58:57.160 --> 59:01.760]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support
[59:01.760 --> 59:07.460]  your immune system. Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is

[59:35.200 --> 59:39.600]  one choice of thousands for improved health and immune system support. To find out how

[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:31.520]  We're now into hour number two. We are engaging a new world order at point blank range with
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:39.160]  huge effect. Police confirmed Bilderberg 2013 to take place in Watford, UK. I'll be there.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.480]  Establishment media spends Al Qaeda use of chemical weapons in Syria. Now that it's come
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:46.600]  out and they've had to confirm that it's chemical weapons the West gave them, wow, it's even
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  come out.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.440]  They're trying to spin it. Well, since we attacked Syria with chemical weapons, we should
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:55.600]  blow up all of Syria. How dare Syria let us bomb them and do nothing? Man, I've never
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:02.960]  heard of something that nasty. Eyewitnesses. The younger Zarnab brother did not shoot Boston
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.680]  cop. It was friendly fire. Remember when the cop shot nine people last year in New York
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.360]  and they kept reporting it was a citizen that did it?
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.760]  And then they even knew it. And then now it's a footnote. I've heard him source nine people
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.560]  shot in New York. Yeah, the cops did it. What about cops shooting innocent people in Southern
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:28.200]  California with a Dorner thing? Video students submit to Obama's security force bag searches.
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.760]  We're gonna play the video and audio this later. This is insane. Remember Obama's domestic
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.320]  security force?
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.520]  Well, almost everyone out on the street again in California with Mark Dies submitted. It's
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.520]  just a volunteer security force. Make sure you're not a terrorist. And they would let
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:49.720]  them search the bag. I mean, this is what sheeple training does. And then it's a bunch
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.000]  of guys in black uniforms shredding around going, hey, you're not supposed to have a
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  gun.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.520]  You're not supposed to be a man. Only government is. We have diplomatic immunity. We're the
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:02.840]  government. We're trying to make all government have diplomatic immunity. And what is that?
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.080]  That's a con game. I'm above the law cuz I say so. The UN says it's above our countries
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:15.040]  because the bankers set it up and got our Congress to agree to that.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:23.920]  It is really unprecedented. So that's what we're gonna be talking about. We're gonna
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.840]  look at the immigration bill, which senators are on record saying will cost trillions.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.320]  And it's not an immigration bill. It's a total legalization. And it's the voting block for
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:39.840]  the Soviet Party. The Republicans, I guess, are kind of like the fascist party, the Soviet
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.240]  Party, to just have a group of people that go, okay, here's your free welfare now. Vote
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.240]  to take their guns.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:51.060]  Okay, I'll vote to take their guns. I gotta be honest. If Switzerland was bordering us
[01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.840]  and there was 30 million people coming in who were gonna try to restore the republic,
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:02.960]  I'd say, okay, I don't care if they had green skin. In fact, if people in Mexico had blue
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:08.600]  antennas but were into freedom, I'm such a libertarian, it was like aliens, but they
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.600]  liked freedom.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:15.600]  Sure, here, you really come in peace? Well, here, just come on in. And I mean, literally,
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.760]  I just don't wanna be a slave. And let me tell you, I mean, I don't wanna live in Mexico.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:32.260]  But all Mexico's got is its fake nationalism, run by a bunch of El Jefe, more billionaires
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:39.160]  per capita in any country. And now the globalists are gonna merge Canada, the US, and Mexico.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.420]  And they have security agreements, look them up, to quote, use Canadian and Mexican troops
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.280]  during civil unrest in the United States.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.520]  That's Washington Post, look that up from like a decade ago. And then, and they have
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:55.320]  the Olympics a few years ago in Canada, US troops were there running checkpoints in Canada
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:04:01.720]  helping. And the Mexican troops came and helped in Katrina, where the military was confiscating
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:08.480]  the guns. They helped, I mean, they're just helping. And I've got the NRA video where
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.680]  they document that most of the guns that are bought by the cartels are full auto and are
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.800]  flown in by big banks.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.480]  That's come out. In fact, you guys print me, Wachovia, Wells Fargo, laundered $376 billion.
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.880]  It's Bloomberg, I wanna show that later. Cuz see, yes, it's true, Mexican citizens are
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.520]  getting semi-automatic guns, handguns, rifles to protect themselves. And you guys print
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.960]  me that too about vigilantes restore order in some Mexican cities.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:41.960]  They get to America, they get guns, they go back, and they fight the cartels and take
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.880]  back control. And that's why Obama's upset, cuz they can't run their extermination. I
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.160]  mean, it's not enough to kill 60,000 Mexicans under the drug war in the last six years.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.320]  And Obama wants to make sure only the government and the cartel has those full automatic machine
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:05:01.000]  guns they're buying from Germany mainly.

[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.800]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:29.280]  Thank you for joining us. We're now into hour number two of this Tuesday, seventh day of
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:36.360]  May 2013 worldwide broadcast. So much is happening. They're trying to completely gut American
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:41.240]  sovereignty and legalize. When they say 13 million illegals, it's more like 30 million
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.840]  illegals openly bragging it so they can vote to take our guns and basically bring us into
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]  the North American Union.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:52.800]  We're gonna be talking to William Gein, the head of Alipak, probably one of the most important
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.380]  real lobbies up there for national sovereignty. We're gonna be talking to him here in just
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:01.760]  a moment. But other big stuff is happening. Obviously, I'm gonna talk more after he leaves
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:11.960]  us today with the situation in the Benghazi gate. And we're gonna be looking at that.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:18.480]  They've got credible whistleblowers to speak tomorrow in a hearing. Now, folks, I already
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.680]  told you what happened. We know what happened. It came out. They stood down for eight hours
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.760]  while Al-Qaeda killed everybody in the building.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.640]  The five regular people and the two SEALs, sheep-dipped in the CIA who refused orders
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:37.360]  to stand down. They had to fire the head of CENTCOM over cuz he threw a fit. It's like
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:46.240]  ten or more other top admirals and generals. They had two predator drones and a C-130 surveillance
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.900]  craft out in the Mediterranean.
[01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:52.800]  They had drones right above it. They sat there and watched the Benghazi security force. This
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:57.320]  is not blowback. They went in there and they killed him so they could say the heat-seeking
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.600]  missiles at a warehouse there full of heat-seeking missiles. It's like 18,000 missiles, 10,000
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  of them heat-seeking.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.440]  A bunch of them were reportedly there. We're into all our sources. And that's now months
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:15.560]  later, we told you this first. By the way, we need to get all our sources back on that
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:22.720]  said all this. It was Colonel Schaffer, Lieutenant Colonel Schaffer said all that. And the guy
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:29.960]  that was in Tripoli a bunch, and in Benghazi, a former NSA, Wayne Madsen and others.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:38.240]  And look, we know eight hour stand down, eight hour stand down while the CIA, Al-Qaeda security
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:46.880]  force, people are like Al-Qaeda, CIA? Yes, they run Al-Qaeda. The CIA is run by foreign
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.080]  banks. I don't know how I have to explain this to you. It'd be like if aliens landed
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:58.720]  and they had blue skin, and they were commanding our military, and our military had collaborated.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.280]  And I'm going, hey, the aliens are commanding our government. The government's illegitimate,
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:08.960]  but they're wearing uniforms. But see, they don't have blue skin, so it's not obvious.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:15.080]  It's foreign banks. Benghazi stand down denials, don't stand up to reason, that's Forbes. I
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.080]  mean, this is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, so I'm gonna get into that.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.120]  Senate passes Internet sales tax bill and then opposition from conservatives. I mean,
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:33.080]  this is incredible. The power to tax is the power to destroy. It's a total control grid.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:42.200]  The cybersecurity bill is. This is a Internet sabotage system. As the Google, 100 times
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:48.200]  faster fiber optic goes in. When that fiber optic is in nationwide in about three years,
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.560]  it's going in Austin.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.100]  It's been put in several other major cities. We noticed they're taking over Midwest first.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.000]  Why isn't it California? Why isn't it New York? They know everybody's fleeing to the
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.520]  middle of the country. It's an enemy operation. They're putting down their fiber in Austin,
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:07.480]  other areas. Austin, they admit, is the agenda 21. They have maps. We've shown it on TV.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.480]  When we go to their meetings, how they're gonna take over here. They even describe it
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:20.880]  as their operations and their dominance. I mean, this is a technocratic takeover.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:26.960]  But they go, we drink beer at the campus and act trendy. We have beards and we're rainbow
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:33.120]  socks. They go behind closed doors. General, fair operations, bring them down. I mean,
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:41.280]  this is an enemy operation, spies. Excuse me. Believe me, folks, you better look into
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:48.640]  this. Man, they're sophisticated. But if you're aware of their operations, we can defeat them.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:54.680]  So you got that going on. I'm gonna talk more about the armed march. My thoughts are exactly
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.660]  what Mike Adams has said. It's at Infowars.com. Armed march on DC announced for July 4th.
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:05.720]  Is Adam Kokesh crazy or courageous? And he shows both sides of it. Why? You have a right
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.960]  to do that. The DC Heller did rule you could have guns, but they're still saying they'll
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960]  arrest you.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:18.240]  They are the tyrants. They are in the wrong. But does this give them an opportunity? Well,
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:24.560]  so I'm saying, when I say be there with video cameras, I'm not saying be there armed. Because
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:28.920]  I can't morally tell people to do something that's so dangerous. That's a decision you've
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:32.520]  got to make. So I'm talking about that in the third hour. Because people are spinning
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.520]  it saying Jones is endorsing it.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:42.640]  I am not endorsing it. I am studying it, looking at it from both sides. You understand that?
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:52.640]  Cuz I respect Lou Rockwell, I respect Adam. But Adam does pull pure stunts. But his argument
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.840]  is he pulls stunts for liberty. I get it, fortune favors the bold. There is a tide in
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.620]  the affairs of men when taking up the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:09.000]  Our fortune is liberty. I get it, I get it. But at the same time, when people are like,
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.080]  I hope you're man enough to be there with your gun, bud. See, don't punch my buttons.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.000]  I'm man enough to play this smart. I'm man enough for the long haul. I'm man enough to
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:28.360]  go all the way and do what's really dangerous. But I'm studying it. And it resonates with
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  people.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:34.360]  And just the idea is part of the animating contest of liberty. Now, we've had multiple
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.360]  senators, I'll show these articles while our guest speaks, say it's gonna cost trillions.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.600]  It is the North American Union, it is the end of our country. You can't go to Mexico.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:46.400]  And how about Mexico? Because that's 80% roughly of the illegal immigration. I can't go there
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400]  and have free babies.
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.000]  I can't go there and become a citizen. Jesse Ventura has tried to become a citizen. And
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:58.640]  they've told him no, a former governor. Jesse Ventura, his daughter can't come down there
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.480]  and have a baby free. But see, America has so much hospitality and the authoritarians
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:11.560]  guilt everybody, not to save Mexico that's in horrible tyranny, a collapsing failed state.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:15.640]  Look at how that's hidden in plain view, not to help them, no, to bring all of America
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:19.920]  down. The globalists admit they want you poor so you can never stand up like Mexico that
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.640]  has more billionaires per capita than any other country in the world.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:29.920]  They have more billionaires in the US, not per capita, period. Because you've got one
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:35.440]  tenth of one tenth of one tenth of 1%. I mean, literally, it's less than a dozen people that
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.280]  own the whole stinking thing. And if you get uppity, police in black uniforms drop by and
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.800]  line you up and shoot you.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:45.440]  I've seen the videos where they line people up and shoot them, and it's not even in our
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:54.160]  news, okay? So that's what's coming to America, and I want freedom for all those people. But
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.760]  instead they've hyped up nationalism, la reconquista, la infasora, the reconquering, America's evil.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:04.440]  All the problems in Mexico or America, well, it's the globalist part of it, but not me,
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.640]  and this is the takeover.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.720]  And William Gein, I appreciate him joining us, of Alipack. He's the leader of Americans
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:15.200]  for Legal Immigration, PAC, or Alipack, which is one of the largest grassroots organizations
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:23.320]  in America, Alipack.com, WilliamGein.com as well. William, you've heard me going over
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:27.440]  this. Obama's blaming the Second Amendment for what happens in Mexico, and we know it's
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.560]  armored vehicles and full auto and grenade launchers they're getting.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:38.200]  Guys, if you pull up Bloomberg, Wachovia, or I'll pull it up, Wachovia, Wells Fargo
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.920]  laundered $376 billion. I mean, they're running all this and then blaming us, and now they
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:47.720]  want to fully split the country open. William Gein, what's happening?
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:53.000]  Alex, first of all, thank you so much for having me on at this very, very critical time.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.080]  The Senate is about to consider this amnesty bill in 48 hours in front of the Judiciary
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:01.680]  Committee, and I listened to your lead-in. You were so on the money, you were right on
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:06.720]  the mark. Maybe not on every detail, but when you describe the United States as facing a
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:11.480]  form of treason from within or a type of warfare being practiced against the United States
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:16.280]  citizens, I am so much in agreement with you there, and it's a thing that, as a leader
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.480]  of a national organization, I've become more vocal about over the last several months.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:27.860]  I believe the United States faces a constellation of threats. Just like our bodies walking down
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:33.220]  the street every day face a constellation of risk from accident and disease and microbes,
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:38.440]  the United States, being what it is, the most valued real estate on the planet, faces a
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:43.040]  constellation of threats. I've been on your program several times over
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.080]  the years, and I've warned people across the country, I said, beware the three nation killers.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.520]  There are three things they want to do to the country, which our partial political revolution
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:18:00.800]  of 2010 held back quite a bit. Now, that holdup, that time we bought the country, has expired
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.480]  and they're back. The three nation killers are free speech. They want people to live
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:10.160]  like they live in Canada and Mexico as part of this integration. In Canada, William Gein
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:14.160]  and Alex Jones would have already been yanked in front of a tribunal with the ability to
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.080]  imprison or fine us terribly. If Alex Jones and William Gein were doing what we're doing
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:23.680]  in Mexico today, we'd probably both be dead long ago. And so they want the freedom of
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:29.120]  speech down. They want the second amendment destroyed, and the American gun laws brought
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:34.480]  into equilibrium with the United States. They're moving on every front. This is the
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:39.560]  radical transformation Obama promised. The corporations, the media, the globalist, the
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.720]  communist, this is the full move. This is it. This is the total attack. This is the
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.440]  war. This is the key jump point. And they've got control of most of the major
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:54.040]  networks. They've even got Rupert Murdoch of News Corp and Fox News now on board with
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:58.680]  the amnesty lobby. So most, you know, I used to be on Fox News all the time. I have not
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.880]  been back on Fox News in two years since I announced and announced correctly that the
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:07.360]  Democrats were going to use large-scale illegal immigrant voters in the western states to
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.320]  stop the Tea Party revolution. That was the last time you heard William Gein on a major
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.720]  national network because the door is closed to me and many others like me at Fox. They've
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:21.760]  studied us for several years because they know that my organization, Americans for Legal
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:27.320]  Immigration PAC, played a key role in defeating amnesty in 2006, 2007, and in 2010.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.800]  So now they're lying. We're not going to break it. I want you to come back and get into this.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:34.440]  But what I've seen them is doing is Obama's angering immigrants with his tough new bill
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:39.720]  when it's total amnesty, basically. And then they call it an anti-immigrant bill. Is that
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:40.720]  correct?
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.360]  No, it's not anti-immigrant. That's just the please don't throw me in that briar patch.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.180]  No, I know. That's what I'm saying. I mean, they're remember what they did five years
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.160]  ago when they wouldn't let people read the bill. We're going to talk about what's really
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.640]  in the different versions. You're up there on the Hill. This is coming up for a vote
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:01.080]  very soon in committee. It's all happening. Internet taxes, you name it.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.580]  Are you one of the millions of Americans worried about change? Do you lose sleep over what
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:09.120]  could happen to your assets and hard earned money? Are you looking for a better way of
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:13.660]  life with more freedom, security and asset protection? If you answered yes to any of
[01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:18.720]  these questions, you should consider investing in the country of Belize. Belize is an independent
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:23.640]  English speaking country only hours from the U.S. with strong banking and asset protection
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:28.960]  laws. In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left in the world today. Belize also
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:33.960]  has a very low cost of living, tropical climate and is home to some of the best real estate
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:41.800]  opportunities in the world. To find out more, call 800-793-2600 or go to buybelize.com.

[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:08.580]  losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:13.080]  us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.480]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:22.500]  you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up
[01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.940]  for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:32.120]  prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct. Be

[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:34.240]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.280]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't

[01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:19.120]  Lindsey Graham, nasty little creature that he is, is out whitewashing Benghazi. While
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:27.080]  acting like he's exposing it, Graham, I think the dam is about to break on Benghazi. And
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:31.300]  on his Senate site, on his Facebook, he says, I think the dam is about to break on Benghazi.
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.960]  We're going to find a system failure before, during, and after the attacks, a stand down
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:44.460]  by the Special Forces. They were ordered to stand down for eight hours, done. We knew
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:47.880]  when it happened, a week after it was the Al Qaeda security force hired.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.320]  I'm going to go back to William Gee on the immigration thing. It's all happening. Internet
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:59.920]  taxes, open borders, all of it, but we can beat it. Why are they so desperate now? Why
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.040]  are they able to get so many Republicans to go along with this now? And how do we beat
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:09.000]  this? And what does the immigration bill really do? Why won't they let the public see a copy
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  of it?
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.660]  Why is Senator Sessions saying if we can read it, it will die? Why are they demonizing Ted
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.600]  Cruz for saying we should be able to read it? Well, I'll answer each one of those in
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.880]  order. But first, I want to thank you again, back when I encouraged Senator Graham to come
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.520]  forward about his homosexuality secret, I came under a lot of heat across the country
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:34.240]  and your show was the first show to like, you know, give me a fair spin with what I
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.240]  had to say.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.480]  And I'll always be grateful to Alex Jones show for that, because I believe that Lindsey
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:42.320]  Graham will sing and dance any tune the elites want them to, to the detriment of the American
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:49.200]  public, because they have the power to put his hidden lifestyle on every major network
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.240]  and destroy him at any moment. Whereas we do not have that.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.160]  By the way, two days after you did that, I didn't know you were gonna do that on air,
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.680]  but you're a respected guy and you're up there on the hill. He suddenly reversed himself
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.560]  on the immigration issue back to the pro sovereignty policy.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.720]  He did he was well, he withdrew from the negotiations with Janet Napolitano and Barack Obama and
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:14.760]  his popularity levels in South Carolina plummeted because that was part of my trap. I knew that
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.800]  since I was a tea party guy, that the press, including Comedy Central, I didn't know it
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.200]  would be Comedy Central specifically, but I would take a lot of heat, which washed over
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.960]  me. It was like flames, but I was untouched by the flames, maybe a couple of scented eyebrows
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.320]  here and there from the calls that I received from angry people thinking I was just being
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.800]  mean to gay people, which wasn't my intention at all.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.760]  But Lindsey Graham's approval ratings dropped to unelectable levels. Now since that time,
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.680]  they've been rebuilding him slowly back up to try to save their brand, save their guy
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.000]  because he's up for reelection this year. But Lindsey Graham is a traitor against the
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.120]  people of the United States and him and people like Marco Rubio and John McCain, I don't
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:56.400]  know what all the elites have on Rubio and McCain like I do Graham, but they'll do and
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:00.600]  say anything because these people are just really good at controlling people.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:06.160]  Now that brings us back to how we defeat these people again. How do we stop S744, which is
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:13.480]  a nation killer? It is an illegal immigration amnesty neutron bomb, Alex. Senator Jeff Sessions,
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:18.400]  who I wish so deeply was the President of the United States of America right now with
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:26.640]  a VP like Joe Arpaio. Jeff Sessions' office has been scrambling to read through this 844
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.840]  plus page bill and try to decipher and interpret what it means for the American public and
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.680]  they found a couple of important things. First of all, between the illegal immigrants that
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.760]  it turns into voters eventually and the increase in legal immigration by 50% when we're already
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.800]  as a nation at a hyper or historically high immigration level, combined with the new visa
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.720]  programs, 57 million people predominantly from third world countries would be allowed
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.120]  to immigrate to the United States or enter with a visa in the next 10 years. I'm going
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:02.960]  to repeat that, 57 million, Alex. We've got a population of about 308 million in the country.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:07.280]  So look around you. If you're in traffic, in your house, look out your window.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.800]  And half the kids in the country right now. Sure, half the kids in the country, I've seen
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:17.040]  the statistics, are the children of immigrants. This is a total rewrite of America and it's
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:21.240]  a rewrite towards third world police states. I mean, this is incredible.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.880]  Well, they're bringing in people that are not like the people that have governed America,
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.280]  that founded America. Not like the people that have governed America for over 200 years.
[01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:34.160]  Not like the people that have paid all the taxes for over 200 years. Not like the people
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:39.040]  who have paid the ultimate sacrifice with their own or their children's blood in the
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.440]  wars to protect the US Congress. Well, they come from authoritarian countries
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.200]  and some of them do appreciate freedom because of it. But the vast majority, like 90% vote
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.800]  once they become citizens, to take my guns. How would you leave a country where you couldn't
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.560]  have guns and then come here and take my guns?
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.880]  I guess because they've never had guns, they don't know.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.560]  Well, they're not even literate in their own languages. They have no idea of the American
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.280]  principles and concepts. What you stand for, what I stand for, what 90% of the people out
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.560]  there in America that are indigenous right now, even the people who are liberal. A lot
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.880]  of these people on the left side, the Democrats, they're gonna be smiling real big in the first
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:22.760]  10 years as Republicans lose everything except for a couple of enclaves in a couple of places.
[01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:26.320]  But then their smiles are gonna be short lived when they figured out that whatever their
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:31.360]  particular issue was, be it the environment, be it gay rights, be it-
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.760]  Oh my God, this country is gonna resemble China. Stay there. I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.120]  that's agenda 21. They're gonna keep us in big city reservations. The elite are gonna
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:47.480]  live out in the countryside, helicoptering around, that's their plan. It is horrible.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.520]  We are gonna be third world.
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:30:01.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.980]  alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged
[01:32:06.980 --> 01:32:12.280]  across the US costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012 we saw the largest drought
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.720]  in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight out of mind and so
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:21.460]  you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages
[01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:25.720]  drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature, but you
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.740]  can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply
[01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:34.680]  with the foods direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient dense food you can

[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:30.880]  are the resistance. We are riding on the storm. Internet, Texas Internet censorship, Benghazi
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:38.560]  gate, our government funding Al Qaeda to overthrow somewhat prosperous and comparatively free
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:49.320]  nations like Libya and Syria into this world were thrown. And again, I know you reap what
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:56.180]  you show. I have incredible empathy. I'm not here making excuses for myself. The media
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:01.800]  spends it like everybody knows we should turn our guns in. Everybody knows GMOs good for
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:07.760]  you. Everybody knows aspartame is good. Everybody knows there's no side effects for vaccines
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:08.760]  kids.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:11.160]  You know, they're trying to pass the bill. We're gonna have a guest pop in at the end
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.100]  of the show. Trying to pass it a day out of committee, just like California, where the
[01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:21.360]  government can say your kid gave consent in a public school to have inoculations. Really,
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:26.340]  can they give consent to drink liquor or have sex? That's statutory rape. That's contributing
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.840]  to the delinquency of minors.
[01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:34.080]  That's common law, constitutionally illegal. And then I was the Austin police chief wants
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.280]  to make it where illegal aliens basically don't get arrested. He was on the news talking
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:44.160]  about that for crimes they commit and stuff. I mean, it's just or doesn't want them deported.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:50.680]  I mean, it is just Twilight Zone because they want the magnet. They want to bring the immigrants
[01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.400]  here, not to come here and bust their butts and build the country.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.200]  Not to come here and get into the free market, become wealthy, and the people that work hard
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.560]  go to the top. No, they say come here and just get on welfare. Just vote to take these
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:10.840]  guys' guns. Hey, you're used to being a slave in Africa or Mexico or Eastern Europe. Come
[01:35:10.840 --> 01:35:17.120]  to America. The head of Alipack, William Geen is here, finishing up with this bill, what
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120]  it does.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.680]  I mean, especially from what I've seen and what you've written about and what Sessions
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.320]  has said, trying to read it in the last few days. It's kind of a repeat of what the bipartisan
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:26.320]  bill did before.
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.400]  Well, it's that plus everything they've ever wanted. And the main key here is first, information
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:38.200]  is important, but people are almost oversaturated in information. We've got to get people organized.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:44.960]  Our main two key points for doing that is our primary website, alipack.us, A-L-I-P-A-C.us,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.640]  and a petition site we have at againstamnesty.com. Both of those websites are carrying the information
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.520]  to keep people up to date on this particular bill, the problems with the bill, the full
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:35:58.480]  talking points with the bill, and we give people the phone numbers they need to call,
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:02.080]  what they need to be saying, how they need to be going about it, and we need people to
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:06.600]  not be paralyzed here. If you can't donate time to make a call, if you can't donate a
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:10.920]  dollar to an organization, you're already neutralized. If you like to hang on and listen
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:15.160]  in horror as things fall apart, then that's up to you. But we've got to take the people
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]  that can still stand.
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.640]  You know, the last two months I've had people running the other direction, past me, screaming,
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.920]  or laying there crying in front of me, pretty much, saying, oh, they've got us, they've
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.000]  got us this time that we're beating, because the psychological operations, the psyops of
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.400]  the globalists, have already neutralized so many people that have immersed themselves
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.000]  in this information. And I've been telling them, look, you don't know the outcome of
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.840]  the battle. But this same thing happened in 2006 and 2007. In the first few weeks or months
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.880]  of the battle, we had people running the other direction saying, oh, the enemy is so superior
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.600]  in finances with this George Soros money and all this stuff, we can't beat them, they've
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.640]  got us, they've got us. We need the people who are willing to march towards the disaster,
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.760]  that are willing to put their hands on the tiger's tail, put their hands around this
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.120]  ancient serpent's neck, and to fight back when the outcome of the battle of whether
[01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:08.760]  the Lord is going to preserve the United States or not is still undetermined at this point,
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.600]  and to move forward on these people. We're organizing at alleypac.us and againstamnesty.com.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.180]  Today we've turned everybody loose calling the Senate Judiciary Committee, which there
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:22.960]  are links to on our homepage for all the numbers for those members. That's a battle we think
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.000]  it's most likely we're going to lose because that committee has been stacked with people
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.760]  like Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake and the Gang of Eighties.
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.800]  Yeah, but what about stuff where they advertise to illegals, come have free babies, come get
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:41.620]  on food stamps. I mean, this is fraud. And again, I can't go to Mexico and get food stamps
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:47.360]  and a free birth and everything. I mean, and then it's like, you're just not a nice person.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:52.880]  It's so incredible. Their judicial watch uncovers USDA records sponsoring US food stamp program
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:58.200]  for illegal aliens, and they advertise it in Mexico. I mean, this is treason. And you
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.800]  know about the North American Union deal 2005 with Bush and Fox and the prime minister?
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.360]  I'm glad you mentioned that, Alex, because look, just the other day when the president
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:12.240]  of the United States was in Mexico, he told, it was reported on ABC News, that he was there
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:18.560]  to increase economic integration in the hemisphere or the continent. Now, we never voted for
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560]  that.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.680]  That would require a treaty by the Senate that's never been passed. The American public
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:28.400]  has never agreed to further integrate our economies, which means integrating our population.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.280]  But Bush signs the deal. Bush signs the deal.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.600]  The first one, Clinton put the NAFTA into place and then Bush launched the SPP security
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:41.400]  and prosperity partnership. And now Obama has continued. I did a quick search right
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:47.480]  before coming on your show on Obama economic integration. I found two very fresh things
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:55.080]  that I want to mention. First of all, from the Christian Science Monitor is praising
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:59.400]  this, what Obama did. It said, President Obama's trip to Mexico will help better integrate
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:05.000]  the two economies. And a piece of Senate immigration reform bill focuses on integrating the mainly
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.440]  Mexican population of undocumented immigrants. Each country must respect each other's sensitivities
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  on these two integrations.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:19.400]  Then the article, which just came out May 1st, goes on to say, very key here, it says,
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.600]  taken together, the president's trip and the immigration reform bill are forcing Americans
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:29.320]  to come to grips with Mexico and Mexicans in a way not seen since the controversial
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.320]  passage of the North American Trade Agreement.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:35.960]  And what does it mean come to grips? It's not like Switzerland is bordering us. I wouldn't
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.200]  want to border France. It's going bankrupt. It's like bordering North Korea.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:45.960]  It's forcing Americans, forcing Americans right there. Where is that coming from? Forcing
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:52.520]  Americans. Who in the world is it that is forcing Americans? But there it is, written
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.680]  third paragraph of the Christian Science Monitor.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:00.240]  No, no, they admit it's globalism. They are merging the three countries and taking our
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.880]  rights away. And then telling Americans, don't be nationalistic. While the Ford Foundation
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:12.920]  for 60 years has funded the most radical anti-American nationalism the world has ever seen in Mexico.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:18.600]  Let's just be honest about this. And folks, you think your taxes are high now? The guns,
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:27.300]  everything, it's gone. We are going to collapse, which is the plan. I mean, folks, it is like
[01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:29.360]  jumping into a sinking ship.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.920]  And again, they love it. They absolutely love it, cuz the globalists are exempt from all
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.160]  of this. How do we beat it? Because they said we couldn't beat the gun bill, and they'll
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.580]  stage something else, or there'll be some new shooting, they're gonna come back. But
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:45.920]  we have got to beat them now on this.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.700]  Here's our last shot, and I mean our last shot at this, okay? If we can slow this bill
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:54.840]  down, which we've already done, those of us already fighting through alleyback.us and
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.760]  against damage.com, we've helped slow this bill down. And every day that we can slow
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:03.760]  it down, every day we can get another Alex Jones show out there on this topic. Every
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:11.520]  day people learn more about the national biometric ID in the bill, the $9 trillion price tag
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:12.520]  on the bill.
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.520]  The-
[01:41:13.520 --> 01:41:14.520]  Good God.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.440]  The waivers for all of the enforcement language-
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.920]  Yeah, let me stop you, let me stop you. Again, the other bills had that before, where we
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:27.320]  all get basically a North American ID, and we've already seen the ads for five years.
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:32.240]  They already issue a North American ID. I mean, this is the total, this is it. This
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.980]  is the end of America.
[01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.240]  We have one more chance if we can stop this bill. Now, if we stop this bill, I think there's
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:44.840]  probably a 70% plus chance that Obama will engage in further dictatorial, unlawful, unconstitutional
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:52.000]  activities unless our current lawsuit that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Union
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.560]  is showing some promise with a Texas judge, Obama will probably just try to make it happen
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.560]  anyway.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:03.680]  Our goal at Alipack is to kill this bill, stop this bill, educate more people, and instead
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.080]  of letting them go to sleep, take the energy of the gunfight that just happened. Take the
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:13.360]  energy of Benghazi gate that has built up. Take the energy of the resistance to the illegal
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:18.960]  alien amnesty overthrow of the American republic and channel everything we've got into the
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:27.280]  2014 elections. The 2014 elections will be our last shot to take civilian control of
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.440]  the United States government back over, and we've got, look, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:35.360]  is on the chopping block. If we get a good, well-financed, well-organized candidate to
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.640]  run against Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and I go down there and stir things up enough,
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:42.400]  you know, hey, we might be able to take him out.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:47.080]  The people of office, the people in Arizona, please, people, you did so great with the
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:52.200]  immigration legislation, and now you sent us back John McCain and Jeff Blake. And I
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.680]  know that John McCain and Jeff Blake not only lied to you guys in Arizona, but they lied
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:43:01.840]  to you with over $30 million spent on their campaigns. And Rubio lied to you. We've got
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.280]  to go after the liars. And let me tell you, the main ones we need to go after are the
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:10.040]  Republican liars, Alex. Now, granted, most Democrats are against this thing, too, but
[01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:16.000]  the poll numbers show us that 90, 80 percent of Republicans are against, and truth, if
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.360]  truth be known, what Lindsey Graham is doing, what Marco Rubio is doing.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:25.120]  And since we're so disadvantaged with opposition having all these billionaires and millionaires
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:29.800]  like George Soros on their side, I am targeting the Republicans. And I'll tell you something
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.840]  else. I've got a little bit more respect for a Democrat than I disagree with. I have some
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:39.480]  lame globalist Star Trek New Generation idea about, oh, we just need to merge everything.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:43.740]  At least they're being more open about it. I have more contempt for the Marco Rubios
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.920]  of the world. And John McCain and the Jeff Blakes, they go around lying to everybody.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.280]  Their entire job is to sit there and lie to people and deceive people on the biggest scale
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:57.480]  of them all. And so I have more contempt for them, including in my home state of North
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.480]  Carolina.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.900]  Well, I mean, I want to say this. Listen, they are going to take the guns. They've set
[01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:05.560]  up Homeland Security, teamed up with all these foreigners who think they're part of the government
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:11.380]  to come after everybody. And it is going to be a civil war because, look, they plan to
[01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:16.600]  have a war with us. Even if we lay down, they're coming to get us. So I hope people realize-
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.800]  The supply drain and the fact that they've got us cornered and things like that. But
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:27.760]  my thing is, it's politics, okay? There still is a peaceful political hope here. If enough
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.760]  Americans-
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:32.800]  No, I know. I'm just saying we're not here trying to scare people. I don't have words
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.280]  to describe how dire our straights are.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:40.480]  Well, do you remember the part of the movie when John Connor's in Crystal Peak and he
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:43.680]  figures out that it's gonna happen and things are gonna get terrible and he's just gonna
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.560]  do the best he can with a little ham radio to keep people organized and do what he can?
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:54.160]  You know, that's what this feels like. But we've got to do what we can because even,
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.920]  you know, politics failing to the degree they have, that's unacceptable.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:04.200]  By the way, the good news is hundreds of millions of guns are getting bought. 70 million plus
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:09.640]  just on record in the last few years. We're buying millions of rounds. People are awake,
[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:15.960]  and I mean across the board, the liberty message to white, black, Hispanic, Asian, people that
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.960]  we can at least talk to who don't-
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:21.680]  That can all be avoidable. That can all be-
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:26.320]  No, I know, but that shows that, I understand we need to beat the bill. But what I'm saying
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.680]  is, it shows that people fundamentally know we've got a corrupt government. But I mean,
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:32.320]  I mean, the government is crazy.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.160]  And people fear this government. And it goes back to Thomas Jefferson. You know, when people
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:41.200]  fear the government, there is tyranny. There is tyranny. That's why Obama's talking about
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:46.600]  it to little student groups and saying, beware the voices that preach about government tyranny.
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.720]  What an anathema. What an anathema to the intrinsic American experience his comments
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:57.160]  are. And when he talks, it's clear to those of us that can see the matrix here, that he
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:04.000]  doesn't talk like he's even one of us or a United States citizen at all. He talks about
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  us and our Second Amendment rights as if it's something alien that he is just forced into
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:13.040]  paying homage to because he's sworn oath and he's gonna pretend like he-
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.040]  Well, no, no, no, that's the tactic. Bloomberg says, I'm the biggest supporter of the Second
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:23.560]  Amendment. That's why it means you turn them in. They do that to neutralize opposition.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:28.960]  It's like NDAA. I'm not gonna sign it. So there's no opposition. Then it turns out the
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.480]  White House wrote it and he did sign it. I mean, it's all deception. And I believe and
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:39.280]  I know they're moving at mock speed now because they're behind about a decade, even their
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:45.160]  own tacticians like Brzezinski say that. And they can see that liberty is growing in the
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.480]  minds of Americans across the board.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:54.360]  Well, you ask why now? Why now is this. But since the last election, and this one year
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:58.280]  before the next election cycle really takes grip, which is usually about January, will
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:04.240]  be about January 2004. If we can stop this bill from passing prior to January 1st of
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.760]  2004, I predict it will not pass. And that is giving us a hint-
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.760]  You mean 2014?
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:16.760]  Yeah, right, 2014. And that gives us the hint of what we've got to do to turn it off. What
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:22.240]  we've got to do right now is locate all the traitors, all of the people pushing this invasion,
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:27.720]  pushing this nation-destroying amnesty invasion, including Republicans like Congressman Ted
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:32.240]  Poe from Texas, who we thought was on our side, who now suddenly pops up and says he
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.720]  supports past citizenship for illegal aliens.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:41.760]  Wow, we've actually had three, it's been embarrassing and shocking. But after eight years of operations,
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.920]  we've had to rescind three endorsements in the last-
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.360]  No, no, you know why? Because look, you see you're finding out who's real now. The system
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:57.140]  is uncloaking. They are going for it all now. And 2014 is everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:02.120]  And I mean, listen, I've had these rallies against the illegal alien rallies where they're
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:06.240]  saying America's bad, Mexico, Mexico. And I've gone to those rallies and a lot of Hispanic
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:10.640]  Americans have shown up with me saying, I get it, I'm a truck driver.
[01:48:10.640 --> 01:48:14.320]  And since the Mexican trucks have been let in, my money's been cut in half. No, no, I
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:19.240]  get it. And it doesn't even help Mexico. I mean, why are the mega rich for this like
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:25.600]  Warren Buffett? Because he wants to bankrupt America. The guy gets banker bailout money.
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:32.040]  The guy is a crook. I mean, this guy shut down the Keystone pipeline to Texas from Canada.
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:37.680]  These people have invested in China. They've invested in Mexico in the slave factories.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:44.040]  They're done. They hate American freedom. I mean, it's so simple. Closing comments.
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.940]  What do we do? Who do we call? How do we stop this?
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:51.800]  We get on board at alleyback.us. We call and bombard the Senate and Congress with calls
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:55.800]  against the bill. But at the same time, we need enough people, volunteers and supporters
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.960]  to fully launch our candidate operations of 2014 now. But these lawmakers like Lindsey
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.360]  Graham and Ted Poe and other people all of a sudden hear from people in their district,
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:08.840]  hey, Congressman Poe, did you hear some guy named Danny Smith is gonna run against you
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:11.280]  because you now support amnesty for illegal immigrants?
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:13.320]  Well, what? Yeah, he's already-
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.480]  Now, this is North American Union. And should they also call the committee? Should they
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]  call-
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:23.040]  They should call the judiciary committee, every member of Congress, every member of
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.720]  Senate and keep those calls rolling and intensify them. Spread the word on social media, internet
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:30.960]  and talk radio and help us start finding candidates and candidates-
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:36.280]  Yeah, and I wanna explain something to the gun lobby. The NRA should be against amnesty
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:41.160]  because Mexico, which is the main group of immigrants, has no Second Amendment. 90% of
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:45.840]  the polls I've seen end up voting illegally or when they become citizens, they take the
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  guns.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:50.640]  They won't have trouble with some of their supporters if they try to dilute or change
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:54.960]  their issue. Alipack, Americans for Legal Immigration Act, while we don't have the budget
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.880]  that the NRA does or the numbers just yet, we are the NRA of illegal immigrants.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.600]  No, no, I know you are. That's why you're on this. But what I'm saying is that we need
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:07.640]  NRA members to get it through their head. Folks, this is it. This is North American
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:12.500]  Union. They've done this in Europe. They've done this in other areas. They flood the country
[01:50:12.500 --> 01:50:17.360]  with people, put them on welfare, and then convert the country to socialism.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:21.480]  And the ultra-rich are then exempt from the taxes, as is coming out in France, and they
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480]  want authoritarianism. This is a-
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:27.360]  They do, and they're bringing in people that hate the predominant indigenous people of
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.800]  the United States of European and Christian descendancy types that have stopped the billionaires
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:36.720]  before, stopped the banks before, stopped the type of tyrannies before.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:40.320]  You're talking about the number one group of people that have enjoyed freedom and prosperity
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:45.040]  in world history, here in the United States, that are being targeted within our economy.
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:49.880]  Well, I'll say this. I want to export liberty to all these countries, and I found that we're
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.780]  able to wake people up, but not if there's the language barrier. And that's why the melting
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:58.080]  pot has been overloaded to do this. The head of Alipack, we appreciate William
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:27.760]  Gein joining us. The fight is now. Thank you, sir.

[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:32.520]  Alex Jones here back live. What William Gaines was just talking about is true. The real renaissance
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:38.540]  or Western liberty coming out of Greece and then Rome and then of course Rome became corrupt
[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:45.140]  no longer a republic and then in the dark ages and then Europe has been the main driving
[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:52.680]  force of liberty worldwide in the last 500 years. But the ideas are what can be transferred.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.960]  But it's true, these third world populations have been taught their own nationalism and
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:02.020]  by the media to racially identify. While the United States is taught to be inclusive and
[01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:08.960]  not to identify, but that was done not to create unity. That was done to create balkanization
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:15.340]  and compartmentalization. You turn on MSNBC, it is the total Democratic Party Ku Klux
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:17.020]  Klan hour.
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:21.260]  But you know, all whites are bad unless they submit to everything the New World Order says.
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:26.260]  That way you make political issues of open borders, taking your guns, socialist healthcare
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:32.100]  racial when it shouldn't be racial. We're all human beings. Do you see that? So they
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:39.780]  don't want to export freedom to other countries. America now exports torture and corruption
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:42.460]  and government drug dealing to other countries.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:46.460]  And then they blame what's good about America for all of those problems when America has
[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:52.820]  been captured. Quite frankly, the nanotech, the genetic engineering, all the craziness
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:58.460]  that's going on is gonna far outstrip this immigration issue in the future. I mean, they're
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.060]  gonna release bio weapons, you name it.
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:05.880]  They're gonna change things very, very quickly. I want freedom all over the world from Africa
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:14.140]  to Latin America to Europe to Asia to Australia to every Pacific island. I want humanity to
[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:21.660]  have better goals and ideas of building a future. But the globalist have an ugly view
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.720]  of humanity and they want to collectivize things not to even make you better.
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:33.140]  But to dominate humanity and then reduce humanity's numbers, sterilize the planet. Most of the
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:40.200]  people bring in GMO. I mean, when I look at this plan, it makes you believe in the devil
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:46.820]  because it's so wicked, it's so destructive, it's so bad even for the elite's own kids.
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:50.860]  And I don't see them getting away with it. We're gonna start the next hour and I've got
[01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:53.940]  to get into the Benghazi situation.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:58.560]  Then I wanna get into the latest on Syria. West provided chemical weapons to Syrian rebels.
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.740]  That's in the RA Novostat, that's the official Russian news. I don't just believe what they
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:09.300]  say, I knew that months ago. That is an accurate report. Eyewitness says the younger brother,
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:15.380]  the bomber, he's convicted, no trial needed, did not shoot Boston cop.
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:20.220]  That's what witnesses are saying, that it's friendly fire. And he saw all sorts of friendly
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.220]  fire with the Dorner thing and in New York shooting nine people. We're gonna get into
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:29.820]  all that. That is all coming up and we're also going to get into an NRA video dealing
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:34.020]  with what's happening in Mexico, where the guns are really coming from.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:38.980]  So all that and more coming up and basically forced inoculation of your school children
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:44.060]  in Texas. This is happening all over the country. They go, well, your child agreed to have an
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:50.060]  abortion, they made the decision. Your child, your 11 year old in California, decided to
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:53.980]  get all the vaccines, but they're not of the age of consent, I'm their parent. You're not
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:55.060]  anymore, Jack.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.660]  By the way, in Mexico, they don't ask, they forcibly inoculate and they forcibly abort
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:07.820]  and they forcibly sterilize. You notice me, the white devil, cuz the media said so, cuz
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:11.740]  I'm white, being white's bad. You notice I'm saying don't abort Mexican babies here or
[01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:15.860]  in Mexico. I wanna fill their head full of liberty. I want them to own guns. I don't
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:20.540]  wanna become rich. I want them to open companies and be doctors and I want your kids, no matter
[01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.100]  what color they are, to go to the stars.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:28.700]  But that's not gonna happen if we keep this new world order going forward. We've gotta
[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:32.100]  bring it down. Be sure and support us if you believe in this info. Spread the word about

[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:36.660]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:59:54.260 --> 02:00:06.020]  Reaching war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:13.060]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:21.860]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:46.260]  You didn't build that. Somebody else built that. Barack H. Obama. You didn't build any
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:50.220]  of it. It's not the individual, it's the collective. Well, what is the collective? It's a bunch
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:59.100]  of slaves run by the technocrats. It's like the New York Times promoted, UN promoted zeitgeist
[02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:00.100]  movement.
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:03.660]  People go, Alex, you're just not intellectual enough to get it. A big central computer will
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:08.400]  direct where we work, what food we get, and what we do. Boy, that sounds like total slavery
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:17.580]  to me. By the way, who programs that computer? You just don't get it. You just don't get
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:26.140]  it. It's so intellectual. Look, this old man made models of science fiction cities, Alex.
[02:01:26.140 --> 02:01:31.260]  I'm like, wow, all the communists and fascists always promised all the space age stuff. All
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:35.540]  they delivered was hell on Earth. I've actually seen the stuff 100 years ago. You're just
[02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:42.380]  recycling that? You don't get what intellectuals, we are, Alex.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:45.580]  And then I said to the zeitgeist guy, I said, look, you know, let's come back on. I didn't
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:49.460]  like we had a big fight five, six years ago. Come back on, explain to me how I'm wrong.
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:54.860]  You have to correct, I never said that you should go to a reeducation camp, that I would
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:58.740]  be reeducated. And I went back and watched the interview and he says, you'll be sent
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:00.900]  to a reeducation center.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:06.420]  You'll be reeducated if you don't accept. And I called him back and I said, but I can
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:12.420]  play it. He goes, I'm not looking. You apologize for that and these other five things, and
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:19.180]  I will come on. Can you imagine walking around, it sounds like the NPR people and Obama and
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:20.180]  all of them.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:27.700]  They just walk around going, we are a master planner. I mean, look, I'm a smart guy. And
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:34.140]  I have trouble running my own life and keeping myself in shape, somewhat of shape. Sat on
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:38.740]  my ass for years, excuse the French, and running things here. And I mean, I got a lot of energy
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:43.100]  and a man, let me tell you, I work 18 hours a day a lot of days. Okay, and I'm sick of
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:47.380]  people, government, bureaucrats, all of you.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:51.300]  Arrogant cops walking, who do you think you are? Like I'm supposed to be scared you got
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:03:03.200]  a gun and a suit. Freaks me out, freaks me out. I mean, I know history, man. I know Danger
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:11.400]  Will Robinson. And it's cuz good people have become so compliant. Good people, good cops
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:15.780]  have gone along with letting mad cops run things.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:18.420]  We have just decided everything's corrupt, and that's just the way it is. I'm just gonna
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:23.180]  have a good time. But you know what? We need to pull back from this and just think we're
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:27.860]  alive one time. Are we really gonna let the worst elements of every form of society run
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.740]  things?
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.580]  And I wanna ask the establishment something. I know you're all competing with each other
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:38.500]  and you're all scared too. So you're just trying to jockey the operation so that you
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:45.860]  come out on top. Look, none of you are coming out on top. And something else I told a reporter
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:51.180]  about a week ago, when everybody sells out, there's not even any power in it.
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:57.300]  Even if you're a cynical bad person, what do the devil say? It's better to reign in
[02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:10.660]  hell than serve in heaven. It's better to burn out than fade away. But what if you're
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:19.220]  in hell? What if you're in a system run by the devil? It's better to reign in heaven
[02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:28.420]  than serve in hell. That's another lie of the devil. You don't serve in heaven. The
[02:04:28.420 --> 02:04:34.180]  saints reign in heaven and cast their crowns at the feet of God and don't want it.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:40.060]  Because when you really rule, you know it's a responsibility and you then have discernment
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:47.420]  and wisdom. I will tell the new world order this and I know it in my heart and soul from
[02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:52.860]  the foundations of eternity. You will never taste your world government. You will not
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:05:01.940]  extend your lives and you will die trying. You have already failed.
[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:07.540]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:12.140]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:06.620]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:11.820]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:16.180]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:20.660]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.
[02:07:20.660 --> 02:07:25.620]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control

[02:09:56.100 --> 02:10:04.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:33.100]  They are pushing this. This is who these flaming freaks are. And anything they support,
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:40.100]  you got to be against it. They want open borders, you got to be against it. I can intellectually
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:45.740]  tell you why that's a bad idea, to have open borders. They want our guns turned in, I don't
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:49.740]  want to turn them in. I can intellectually show you why it's good to keep your guns.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:54.040]  They want you to take vaccines, they're bad people with a bad history. Caught carrying
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:59.280]  out eugenics, giving people syphilis, you name it, radiating foster kids. Boy, a known
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:01.860]  group of killers, you don't put something in your body they're telling you to put in
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:08.860]  your body. They're a known group of scum. Our government's been hijacked, so I'm against
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:15.020]  vaccines and I'm against Agenda 21. What do you thunk? It's a foreign banking scam to
[02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:19.700]  shut down everybody but them so only they can operate.
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:24.660]  We're fighting a global mafia and they can think up anything. They create the issuance
[02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:29.420]  of money and credit. So they want to shut down production because that's what gives
[02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:36.420]  them real control. It's not about money, it's about power, it's about domination. It's about
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:44.100]  keeping us the little ants in line. Remember in the Bugs Life? Or was it Ants? What movie
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:51.100]  is that? Bugs Life or Ants? Yeah, Bugs Life. You're like, hey boss, why are we gonna send
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:52.660]  them to the ants?
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:57.020]  We got plenty of food. We got plenty of food here, we don't need to make those ants collect
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:02.900]  food for us. And he goes, those ants outnumber us 100 to 1. And if they ever figure that
[02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:09.900]  out, it's over for us. It's not about food, it's about power. Let's ride, they turn their
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:14.060]  wings on and fly back to dominate them. He goes, quite the motivational speaker, don't
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:17.540]  you think?
[02:12:17.540 --> 02:12:24.540]  I'm watching every form of classical stinking evil run rampant. They're building FEMA camps.
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:33.180]  They admit one year they spent $5 billion, when was that, like 2006 when they declassified
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:39.740]  it. $5 billion in a geoengineering program. And last year they announced, guys, type
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:46.020]  in $10 billion for geoengineering. But then I go, okay, so you're adding it to the jet
[02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:49.820]  fuel, here's the patent, even the pilots don't know, and then aerosolizes it.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:54.180]  And why are you doing that? Well, we don't wanna tell you, but maybe we blew holes in
[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:58.960]  the atmosphere when we detonated all those hydrogen bombs in the 60s in the upper atmosphere.
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:03.860]  And then they had a plan to try to blow up the moon. And then I have writers call me
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:09.300]  and go, do you really believe they tried to blow up the moon? Do you really believe that
[02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:14.380]  they detonated the US alone over 100 hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere, trying to blow
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:18.640]  up the Van Allen radiation belt to get spacecraft through it?
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.260]  And I just go, and I just look at the reporters now and go, no, you're right, I made that
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:28.260]  up. They're like, really, you did? And I said, yeah, man, yeah, man, whatever you want, whatever
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:35.260]  you want. Because I can't deal with it anymore. We have let every crazy person, every nut
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:39.940]  case, every globalist get control, and no one will say no to them.
[02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:42.700]  Mark Dice, I wanna get to this, if I don't get to it now, I'll play it on the nightly
[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:45.700]  news tonight, cuz I got a guest coming up. We'll cue that up, I'll play it up after the
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.740]  guest comes on. Mark Dice went out, and he went out to the campus, and he said, hi, I'm
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:55.740]  with Obama's domestic security force, volunteer security force.
[02:13:55.740 --> 02:14:00.060]  I wanna search your bag to make sure you're not a terrorist. And every person let him
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:07.060]  search their bags. He was wearing a shirt that said troll on it, had a troll on it.
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:16.060]  He said, I am a troll. Hi, I'm a troll with Obama, I'd like to search your bag to make
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.140]  sure you're not a terrorist. I'm with Obama, you say Obama, folks, these people, if you
[02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:24.940]  said Obama says slit your throat, I'm telling you, some of them would do it.
[02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:29.940]  Because their whole identity is, and they watch TV, and they watch TV, and they watch
[02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:36.940]  TV, and they do whatever. Obama, Obama says turn my guns in, Obama says eat GMO, Obama
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:43.940]  says have open borders, Obama says, Obama says Obama's in, Obama's a teleprompter.
[02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:55.660]  You're saying you have the clip ready now? All right, let's just go ahead and play some
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:59.840]  of that now. I mean, it's up on infoawards.com, Paul Watson wrote a story about it. You gotta
[02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:04.140]  see the video of your radio listener. And you can go out to him and say, we want Nazi
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:06.820]  Germany to take over America to take the guns for Obama.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:12.340]  They go, Nazis for Obama? Yeah, I'll sign that. And then he talks to the guy and he
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:16.100]  goes, now you're sure about that? You wanna ban the guns and put them, arrest the gun
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:22.100]  owners and Nazi takeover? He goes, man, you don't have to convince me, I understand.
[02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:27.340]  He's like, he just looks at Martin, cuz to that guy who has no power in his life, it
[02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:34.740]  sounds pretty powerful to lock people up in a camp. I mean, that's sexy, man. I mean,
[02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:41.980]  these people are just pathetic, begging to be overrun, begging.
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:44.500]  Here's the problem though, there are a large portion of us that are awake and know what's
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:48.740]  going on, and you can call us crazy all day. Yeah, we're crazy like a fox, we're crazy
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:52.860]  awake. Let's go to Mark Dice's video, he's got one where they say, all of them say ban
[02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:53.860]  the First Amendment.
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:57.780]  He goes, we're gonna arrest the Tea Partiers and ban their First Amendment, cuz they don't
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:03.380]  like Obama and he needs to be the boss. And they go, yes, yes, I wanna sign that. This
[02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:09.180]  is everyone in Southern California that he talks to, all of them. We go out in Austin,
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:13.940]  let's ban water, yes, ban water. Let's take everybody's guns, yes, let's take everybody's
[02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:14.940]  guns.
[02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:21.260]  Cuz it's real simple, I'm trendy, we gotta go out and say hi. Well, I think we already
[02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:24.220]  did it, we gotta edit it, I haven't seen the video yet. I think they went out last week,
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:34.100]  did they? And shot a piece saying post-birth abortion for the Earth. For the Earth, Obama
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:38.980]  wants to abort babies up to age three, and I guarantee you they're gonna sign it.
[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:44.820]  Really, abort babies for the Earth? Let's go ahead now, you can't ever blame the Germans
[02:16:44.820 --> 02:16:51.500]  anymore, folks. Okay, I mean, people follow orders. You get a tyranny in, it's over. And
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:54.620]  they're trying to get it all in place right now. Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:59.580]  Take a quick look in your backpack, just checking for explosive materials in the wake of the
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:05.500]  Boston bombings. We're just making sure that nobody's carrying any harmful or potentially
[02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:07.260]  hazardous materials on campus.
[02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:13.240]  Okay, you're clear to go. Thank you so much for that. Take a quick look in your bag, make
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:17.140]  sure that you're not carrying any explosive materials in the wake of the Boston bombings.
[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:20.580]  What is this for?
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:26.220]  Thank you for not being a sucker. Hey, sir, excuse me, sir, one second, stop. Just need
[02:17:26.220 --> 02:17:29.700]  to take a quick look in your backpack, make sure we're not having any potentially hazardous
[02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:31.260]  or explosive materials in here.
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:32.260]  Are you serious?
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:37.500]  We're just part of the Obama Citizen Security Volunteer Force, just in the wake of the Boston
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.260]  bombings, we can't be too sure this is a black backpack. Okay, you're clear to go, sir, thank
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:42.260]  you.
[02:17:42.260 --> 02:17:44.020]  Wait, are you serious?
[02:17:44.020 --> 02:17:49.460]  No, we're just showing how suckers people are and they'll just sit and obey and willingly
[02:17:49.460 --> 02:17:51.420]  let their Fourth Amendment be violated.
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:58.220]  My God, I can't believe that guy just laughed.
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:18:02.020]  Excuse me, sir, just need to take a quick look in your bag for make sure there's no
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:05.660]  explosive material. Stop one second, just need to make sure that there's no explosive
[02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:07.140]  materials in this bag or anything.
[02:18:07.140 --> 02:18:15.060]  But that's enough, full video up on infowars.com and Paul Watson's article. Californians let
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:20.740]  Obama domestic security force in quotes, search their bags. And then he goes out and does
[02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:25.500]  it on the boardwalk and the police come over and go, well, I guess you're saying it's voluntary,
[02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:27.300]  so okay.
[02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:33.340]  But people don't like it when we do this. And again, they're in uniforms with a gun.
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:39.180]  And now in Austin, they are, we're searching everybody's bags randomly on Lamar, TSA, feds
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:44.700]  out of their jurisdiction, aren't even sworn police, out there with Austin police searching.
[02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:48.500]  And then you say no to them, they're like, how dare you say no to me? It's exactly the
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:52.660]  same deal, it's asinine.
[02:18:52.660 --> 02:18:58.280]  And we have another video, I'll play some of coming up after the break, where they signed
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:03.740]  petitions, every one of them to ban free speech. And they speak English, these are white guys,
[02:19:03.740 --> 02:19:06.820]  black guys, Hispanic, you name it. I mean, they're like, yeah, we're gonna ban the Tea
[02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:09.220]  Party from their speech, yeah.
[02:19:09.220 --> 02:19:13.440]  Yeah, and we're gonna, cuz you're not allowed to talk about Obama. I mean, he needs to totally
[02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:18.700]  run things now, we're gonna have authoritarianism now. They're like, absolutely. They're like,
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:23.740]  yeah, people are causing a problem talking about Obama. Yeah, let's ban the First Amendment,
[02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:24.740]  let's arrest them.
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:31.300]  And these are people having conversations, making eye contact, clearly, audibly saying
[02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:37.740]  that they're going to do all of this. And California, they've won there. We're on the
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:43.740]  radio there, there's some good people up there. And look, California's going bankrupt, they
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:49.260]  love it. They're gonna take the entire middle class' money, and the ultra-rich that are
[02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:52.620]  exempt, are gonna, of course, move out of California.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:57.220]  And this is what they do everywhere. They've now got taxes above 75% in France, and the
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:00.980]  government on record is exempt. You heard me, they're exempt.
[02:20:00.980 --> 02:20:06.020]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates. Do you know the number one most valuable item in
[02:20:06.020 --> 02:20:11.620]  a crisis? Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct
[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:18.360]  answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:24.460]  item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one
[02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:29.020]  critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth is that
[02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:34.220]  you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside
[02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:37.940]  your door. But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:40.260]  and death for you and your family.
[02:20:40.260 --> 02:20:46.500]  Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[02:20:46.500 --> 02:20:50.940]  You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have
[02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:56.580]  already seen in the last three months. Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before
[02:20:56.580 --> 02:21:01.260]  they force me to shut it down. Again, that's crisis123.com.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:06.740]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:12.020]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:16.260]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight
[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:21.220]  out of mind and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are we all are
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:26.180]  food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[02:21:26.180 --> 02:21:31.260]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:07.780]  you know that mercury from your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as
[02:23:07.780 --> 02:23:12.100]  metal particles into your body wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:15.920]  functioning normally. Animal studies show that mercury causes kidney function to drop
[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:20.640]  by 60 percent. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding
[02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:24.700]  drop in function. The number one method by which your body detoxifies itself of mercury
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:29.580]  is glutathione. The number one superfood that helps turn on all 75 trillion cells of your

[02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:14.300]  Folks, I got a correction to make. I said Wells Fargo and Wachovio laundered $376 billion
[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:18.020]  in drug money over two years according to federal documents that Bloomberg covered.
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:23.780]  It's 378 billion. I always say 2 billion less for some reason. 378 billion, we're going
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:28.080]  to show you that news article again in a moment. We showed it last hour. They were supplying
[02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:33.820]  the aircraft, the weapons, everything. And we've pulled up some of the news articles
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:38.100]  and I've got an NRA piece that also gives its sources where the Mexican drug cartels
[02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:44.100]  get at least three-quarters of their weapons they buy from the Mexican military or they
[02:24:44.100 --> 02:24:51.340]  buy that come in on international flights, fully auto, grenade launchers, you name it.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:55.600]  There it is, banks financing Mexico gangs admitted in Wells Fargo deal. Who's Wells
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:01.260]  Fargo? It's Warren Buffett. Yeah, Warren Buffett's the real gangster folks. He makes Capone look
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:08.860]  like a schoolboy. Warren Buffett has gotten hundreds of billions of dollars, look it up,
[02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:09.940]  of bailout money.
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:17.220]  Just type Warren Buffett, biggest beneficiary of bailout. And now you've got to buy insurance
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:26.300]  from him. That's why he's got record profits this year. He runs things, he's El Jefe, El
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:31.540]  Gordo. Warren Buffett, champion of bailout, also leading beneficiary, McClatchy News.
[02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:37.860]  So now you know, but document can please. Obama blames in Mexico days ago, we've been
[02:25:37.860 --> 02:25:48.740]  covering this, Obama blames US gun owners. And I'll be honest with you, there are a lot
[02:25:48.740 --> 02:25:51.780]  of guns from the US going into Mexico that weren't shipped there by Obama to blame the
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:52.780]  Second Amendment.
[02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:56.900]  And I say great, criminals are gonna have guns, government's gonna have guns anyways.
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:01.260]  I've seen the numbers, the semi-autos, the shotguns, the handguns, Mexicans are getting
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:05.060]  them and taking them home to protect their families. And by the way, you can pull up
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:11.140]  the articles, Mexican vigilantes are restoring order in city after city. Vice News has covered
[02:26:11.140 --> 02:26:12.900]  it, you name it.
[02:26:12.900 --> 02:26:18.580]  So they hate it. Criminal Obama and the criminal drug cartels run by the CIA in many cases,
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:22.740]  that's come out in court, they hate it. So they hate the fact that the Mexicans are getting
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:27.580]  guns. I mean, what are they gonna do if the Mexicans get guns to protect themselves? Then
[02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:31.100]  the cartels, see the cartels will only attack you most of the time if they think you're
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:36.380]  not armed. And they demand money off people to let their kids go to school safe.
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:42.340]  Even poor people, they're shaking down now. Mexico is totally imploded into a hell. And
[02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:47.020]  I say more power to the Mexican people to get guns and protect themselves. You know
[02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:52.600]  the answer to free Mexico? Give guns and firearms training to every family in Mexico and the
[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:54.860]  problems will be over very, very quickly.
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:58.880]  You look at China and places that are under hellish control, cuz they've taken the guns
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.100]  from the people. And only government has the guns. North Korea, you name it. Tyrants hate
[02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:09.180]  guns. Let's go ahead, they hate guns in your hands. Let's go to this NRA piece breaking
[02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.020]  it down, here it is.
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:16.660]  You don't care about your laws here. We can get weapons anywhere. We get weapons from
[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:18.860]  Honduras and El Salvador.
[02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:23.020]  Majority of the weapons are not coming from the US. Three quarters of the weapons that
[02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:28.740]  the cartel gets is supplied by the military.
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:35.380]  Eruption in Mexico is not a problem. It's an institution.
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:39.160]  It's a business for the government, for the military, and for the cartels. Why would you
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:44.800]  stop the business when it's working so well?
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:51.140]  The worst of their society coming here to America to prey upon our innocent citizens.
[02:27:51.140 --> 02:27:52.580]  And this isn't a problem?
[02:27:52.580 --> 02:27:54.660]  The federal government has abandoned us.
[02:27:54.660 --> 02:27:57.340]  Do I think the border is secure? Hell no.
[02:27:57.340 --> 02:28:00.580]  We've been driving down this border road here for about 10 miles. Have you seen a border
[02:28:00.580 --> 02:28:03.460]  patrol agent yet? The border patrol is not on the border.
[02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:06.900]  I know that border, I think, as well as anyone.
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:10.100]  We turn on the TV and Janet Napolitano says...
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:13.460]  It is as secure now as it has ever been.
[02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:14.460]  Not my question.
[02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:15.460]  Senator, please.
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.900]  In my opinion, it's borderline treason.
[02:28:17.900 --> 02:28:22.900]  There's traffic through here unstoppable. The agents, we don't have enough.
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:27.620]  Oh, absolutely. I carry a gun everywhere I go.
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:31.540]  We're looking at human smuggling, drugs, terrorists coming across our property.
[02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:35.300]  From Syria, from Iran, from Turkey, from China.
[02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:39.580]  My wife comes home from the grocery store and a woman's head is in the front yard. Is
[02:28:39.580 --> 02:28:42.980]  this America or is this Iraq?
[02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:48.380]  National security should not be a political game. And these jokers make it just that.
[02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:54.940]  For us and my family, our safe haven has been destroyed. And that is unfordoable. And I
[02:28:54.940 --> 02:28:58.260]  don't know how this government is ever going to give that back to you.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:29:02.500]  To slap in the face the citizens of this great country of ours, to slap in the face the people
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.740]  that have fought for this flag that we represent.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:10.420]  I fear for my grandchildren, what they are going to be left with. It's our right to being
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:13.220]  stripped on a day-to-day basis.
[02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:21.340]  Angry? You betcha. Surprised? No. No president who has the best interests of this nation
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:27.140]  as a nation as it was created would ever, ever do something like this.
[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:33.980]  These guys ought to be criminally tried for what they're doing to this nation.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:40.180]  Everything we love about America, all the freedoms our forefathers fought for, all of
[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:42.460]  it is under attack by Barack Obama.
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:43.460]  No kidding.
[02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:47.060]  So pass this story along, then join the NRA.
[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:50.820]  Absolutely. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:30:01.820]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:01.460 --> 02:32:06.260]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:10.560]  a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:15.260]  fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across
[02:32:15.260 --> 02:32:20.800]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[02:32:20.800 --> 02:32:26.100]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:31.660]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:36.380]  Younggevity. The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:41.460]  need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost

[02:33:53.980 --> 02:34:06.100]  We're not about to make that same mistake. Ministry bringing us in. Oh yeah. Man, I tell
[02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:11.300]  you, anybody who says they're bored because they watch TV all day and the false culture,
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:15.820]  if you're awake folks, you're not bored. The world, the technological developments, the
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:22.420]  good, the bad, the incredible things unfolding, the unspeakable things going on. I haven't
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:24.820]  even gotten into Benghazi and I really should.
[02:34:24.820 --> 02:34:28.980]  The hearings are amara. The indication we're getting from the Republicans is they're gonna
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:35.540]  try to score some political points, but actually not do anything because they're the ones with
[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:42.380]  Obama saying attack Syria, use Al-Qaeda against them. They're all up to it in their eyeballs.
[02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:47.860]  So they'll criticize Obama for not giving support to the ambassador and letting Al-Qaeda
[02:34:47.860 --> 02:34:54.500]  kill them when the State Department hired the Al-Qaeda group, brought them in to overthrow
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:58.940]  Libya and that was the group they hired for security at the safe house and the weapons
[02:34:58.940 --> 02:34:59.940]  cache.
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:06.740]  Down the street, they had a big military torture center. Again, Obama's continuing with torture.
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:10.940]  And it's just an example of there is no Democratic Party. There is no Republican Party at the
[02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:15.500]  top. There are a bunch of crooks. But the mainline Republicans and the Democrats are
[02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:20.300]  all attacking the proto tea party that came out of Ron Paul, myself and others.
[02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:26.220]  That's the group they're going after, constitutionalist, because the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
[02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:33.220]  the Declaration of Independence, common sense, and not laying down to tyranny, being uppity,
[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:39.560]  sits incontrovertibly against them. There aren't many populations that won't put up
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:46.900]  with being slaves. The Afghans won't do it. There are areas of Africa where people never
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:49.900]  really been totally taken over.
[02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:56.300]  There are a few areas of Mexico where nobody's been able to take over. Areas of Chiapas and
[02:35:56.300 --> 02:36:00.860]  things cuz it's really just natives down there. It's like Native Americans who are still down
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:06.380]  there and pretty much same thing as the Comanches or something. Everybody else is being assimilated
[02:36:06.380 --> 02:36:12.020]  and taken over by the globalist corporate board. And bottom line here, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:36:12.020 --> 02:36:16.140]  is the New World Order is not taking us over to make us civilized and bring us into the
[02:36:16.140 --> 02:36:17.140]  future.
[02:36:17.140 --> 02:36:20.740]  They're doing exactly what was done to natives in this country. Put you on a reservation,
[02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:27.840]  use bioweapons against you. Use cultural death against you. Overwrite and destroy your culture.
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:31.420]  This is what the globalists are doing. The globalists have their culture. It's psychopathic
[02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:36.540]  control of society, the destruction of the family, medical tyranny.
[02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:45.620]  So we're gonna get into eyewitness, the Zarnab brother, the one still alive, did not shoot
[02:36:45.620 --> 02:36:49.100]  Boston Cop. It was friendly fire. And Watson goes into all the other examples of where
[02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:53.760]  they've done friendly fire and tried to frame people for it, very powerful. And that's in
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:56.180]  mainstream news.
[02:36:56.180 --> 02:37:01.420]  Cop must have known a little too much and our cops knew too much. And then the whole
[02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:06.220]  thing's a cover up. It's not just that, you add it all together. Also, West providing
[02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:10.620]  chemical weapons in Syria, that's coming out mainstream news. We're getting to that. We've
[02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:16.300]  got a little bit on the Benghazi, but Lindsey Graham and others are like, this is really
[02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:17.380]  the damn breaking.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:23.620]  That's how you lie to somebody. It's like you bust in with some guy in bed with your
[02:37:23.620 --> 02:37:30.660]  wife and he says, this is the damn breaking. I'm gonna come clean for you right now. I'm
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:37.380]  gonna admit everything. You're like, really, you are? Yes, I'm a gynecologist and I dropped
[02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:43.860]  by here tonight to do a medical checkup on it for free cuz I just wanna be a friend.
[02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:48.620]  I mean, that's what Lindsey Graham's doing. He's like, now I got the dams breaking here.
[02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:54.140]  There was total systematic failure and stand down for eight hours on accident. Obama, you
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:57.940]  did a terrible job. We're gonna give the State Department more diplomatic funding and more
[02:37:57.940 --> 02:38:03.380]  security funding. How dare you? And Obama will say, I could have done a better job,
[02:38:03.380 --> 02:38:04.380]  you're right.
[02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:09.940]  Not, well, we hired all kind of the run security and we ordered to stand down for eight hours
[02:38:09.940 --> 02:38:13.460]  while they killed everybody inside. So there wouldn't be any witnesses that we gave them
[02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:19.500]  10,000 heat seeking missiles cuz we're planning to use those on the West to bring in martial
[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:20.500]  law.
[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:25.140]  And so yeah, we killed the ambassador. You bet we did and we'll do it again if we need
[02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:30.100]  to. No, no, you don't want the public to know that. And it may have been a neocon double
[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:34.580]  cross. Some of my experts think that might have even happened and there was a group within
[02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:36.980]  there that told Obama just keep sleeping and they did.
[02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:40.740]  I don't know cuz all these Democrats make it about Obama. There's no way he'd do that.
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:44.580]  There's no way he'd. Really, when they bomb a couple hundred people and kill them to kill
[02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:49.580]  one bad guy, they call it collateral damage. They will kill people all day, including each
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:50.580]  other.
[02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:55.460]  Don't you people get it? Tyranny isn't sexy. It's not cool. It's not fun. I wanna go to
[02:38:55.460 --> 02:39:00.620]  our guest Judy Powell. And they're voting on this today in the committee and this is
[02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:05.300]  being passed all over the country, ladies and gentlemen. She's the co-founder communications
[02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:06.300]  director.
[02:39:06.300 --> 02:39:11.140]  We should get her on sometime in studio on CPS. The battles she's been through with parents
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:14.860]  cuz it's mainly middle class people. They hunt your kids cuz they get top dollar from
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:21.220]  them from the adoption houses. Just like in China, the Falun Gong that only eat organic
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:24.180]  and exercise have the best organs.
[02:39:24.180 --> 02:39:29.780]  And so they blood type them, genetic type them and keep them there in their prison cell.
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:33.620]  Exercise them, feed them well until an American wants an organ or so you don't ask where it's
[02:39:33.620 --> 02:39:36.780]  coming from.
[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:41.720]  So they're warehousing our kids, that's a separate issue. But here is the bill, document
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:56.460]  can please. The bill is HB 1340. The bill is HB 1340 and Judy Powell joins us. She heads
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:40:02.620]  up parentguidancecenter.org and they're trying to pass it in the Texas House.
[02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:07.580]  Here is the bill right here. The bill would allow minors 14 age or older to consent to
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:11.080]  their own immunization unless the medical provider has knowledge the child's parent
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:13.580]  or guardian has expressly refused to give consent.
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.440]  See, all over the country they're giving kids shots as young as five without parental consent
[02:40:17.440 --> 02:40:22.780]  and saying it's an accident they didn't know. California made it down to age 11. Now, can
[02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.460]  your 14 year old give consent to have sex with maybe the principal? Principal's like,
[02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:31.640]  hey, your 14 year old wanted it, wanted the drugs.
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:34.500]  That's why they sell drugs to kids or give it to them free to get them addicted and then
[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:39.440]  say, now go take money out of your mom's purse and bring it to me. And then nobody bust him
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:44.580]  cuz he's paying the cops off. And so there you go and the bill gets even worse in its
[02:40:44.580 --> 02:40:45.580]  language.
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:51.460]  And then next they're also trying to get abortion without parental consent. Hey, in California,
[02:40:51.460 --> 02:40:56.940]  your 11 year old needs a letter to go to the planetarium or the zoo, but not to get an
[02:40:56.940 --> 02:41:01.980]  abortion or get shot up with deadly vaccines that the insert says can kill him. So Judy
[02:41:01.980 --> 02:41:06.820]  Powell fighting this valiantly is a citizen activist right down there at the Capitol right
[02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:08.660]  now as he joins us from the Capitol.
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:13.300]  Judy, thank you for joining us. Tell us the latest on this bill and the phone numbers
[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:15.620]  and who we need to call and what we need to do right now.
[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:20.460]  Well, the latest is it's going to the House floor today. We're thinking maybe in a couple
[02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:21.460]  hours.
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:22.460]  It's already out of committee. My God.
[02:41:22.460 --> 02:41:25.980]  It's out of committee, yeah. It's going to a four vote right now, today. It's on the
[02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:33.740]  calendar for today. So we need people to call their local representative in the House side
[02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:39.620]  and tell them vote against HB 1340. That would be the best thing for everyone to do.
[02:41:39.620 --> 02:41:42.820]  Doesn't it show how criminal the government is? They're shooting kids up everywhere and
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:46.980]  telling them it's the law, then don't tell your parents. And then they're being caught
[02:41:46.980 --> 02:41:48.620]  doing this all over the place.
[02:41:48.620 --> 02:41:52.620]  And so now their answer is just say no more parental consent. I mean, this is unprecedented.
[02:41:52.620 --> 02:41:58.420]  Right, exactly. And we feel like this bill is usurping parental authority and kind of
[02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:03.060]  going around the normal medical process. And it's really about probably the HPV vaccine
[02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:07.700]  because a lot of these vaccines are required to get into schools and children know that.
[02:42:07.700 --> 02:42:12.620]  So say they're sitting at the doctor's office on a sick visit and the doctor introduces
[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:16.860]  some vaccine that's not required to get into school. They're not going to know the difference.
[02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:20.420]  And so they're going to say, sure, yeah, I want to be safe from cancer or whatever, you
[02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:22.700]  know, the doctor is talking at the time.
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:26.700]  Oh, yeah. It's like, hey, we don't have to even go grab kids from CPS now and test stuff
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:28.380]  on them. We can just do it with your kids.
[02:42:28.380 --> 02:42:33.140]  Exactly. And like you said earlier, you know, they're not capable of consenting to sex.
[02:42:33.140 --> 02:42:37.020]  They're not capable. We don't let a 14 year old, you know, drink alcohol. They can't even
[02:42:37.020 --> 02:42:40.620]  go to the school nurse without oversight. You know, they have a headache. They can't
[02:42:40.620 --> 02:42:44.540]  even take an aspirin without the nurse looking over their shoulders. Yet we're going to have
[02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:46.020]  them consent to these immunizations.
[02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:50.580]  Well, see, that's the next phase of parents can't even give their kids a Tylenol. It's
[02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:56.860]  only the school. Only they can. Only they have the power. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:03.140]  And so, I mean, it's just expanding government authority over, of course, with the federal
[02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:06.980]  health care act going through, we think it has a lot to do with that. And so they're
[02:43:06.980 --> 02:43:13.760]  trying to get more and more kids into these hospital homes or the medical home, whatever
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:19.220]  they want to call it, and usurp the parental authority. And in this bill, it specifically,
[02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:25.060]  the most disturbing part is, if your child does consent, it has a clause that says the
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:29.700]  health care provider or facility is not liable for the immunization of a child under this
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:34.860]  section except for the provider's or facility's own acts of negligence, which we already know
[02:43:34.860 --> 02:43:40.860]  in the vaccine industry that pharmaceutical companies are immune from prosecution. And
[02:43:40.860 --> 02:43:45.100]  so we have a bill here that says if we go ahead without your parental authority and
[02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:49.900]  vaccinate your kid and something happens, gee, I'm sorry, Johnny died. We're not
[02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:55.580]  responsible. And so that's the most disturbing part of the bill, I think, is by, you know,
[02:43:55.580 --> 02:44:00.300]  providing a 14-year-old consent. Now, they try to cover themselves in the bill by saying
[02:44:00.300 --> 02:44:07.340]  that they already have on file that a parent has consented to medical treatment, but medical
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:13.860]  treatment, in our opinion, is very different than immunization. And immunization is a choice.
[02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:18.060]  Medical treatment is, you know, sure, if your arm is broken, reset it. If you're in an
[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:22.820]  emergency situation, resuscitate. I can't think of any instance that we have an immunization
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:27.860]  that's going to save a kid's life. So they say that if you've consented to this
[02:44:27.860 --> 02:44:31.780]  medical treatment, then you've already consented, but that's a very different thing in the
[02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:37.900]  immunization world. Because so far, many states, we still have a choice for religious exemptions
[02:44:37.900 --> 02:44:38.900]  or philosophical exemptions.
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:42.380]  Absolutely. Now, is there a general number? Because every time I try to find numbers,
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:45.620]  there's numbers for each person. I'll put them back on screen. Should we call the Speaker
[02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:51.040]  of the House? Or who is most? Because people say, give us a number. If people are so lazy,
[02:44:51.040 --> 02:44:55.260]  they won't even find the number or type in Texas State House contacts. You can find out
[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:59.960]  email them. Because again, I should have dug these numbers up before you got here. Do you
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:02.900]  have those numbers in front of you or do you have a general switchboard number?
[02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:08.260]  Unfortunately, I don't. Yeah, I go through this every year or so when I end up going
[02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:12.700]  over the Texas State House. I'm gonna hang on the wall next time. Of course, they change
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:17.120]  numbers sometimes too, so that we can do that. But of course, they try to hide the numbers
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:18.120]  as well.
[02:45:18.120 --> 02:45:21.300]  Will you put it back on screen? I'll just hand give these out individually to everybody
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:24.980]  out there on the radio. We'll punch that back up. And you can go to-
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:28.700]  The best thing to do is find your address. If you go to the regular site and you type
[02:45:28.700 --> 02:45:33.340]  in your address, then you find your representative. Because representatives listen to their constituents
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:39.900]  specifically. So if you go to the main site, it has an area that says, who is my representative?
[02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:44.500]  And you can click on that and you put in your home address. And I don't keep track of that,
[02:45:44.500 --> 02:45:45.500]  as far as we know, right?
[02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:50.460]  Sure, you can go to texasdirectory.com and they've got all the up-to-date numbers for
[02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:55.320]  each member. But again, and if you're listening in New Mexico, you're listening in Maine,
[02:45:55.320 --> 02:46:00.300]  they are trying to pass this and are passing this everywhere. In some cases, children as
[02:46:00.300 --> 02:46:07.640]  young as 11. And it overthrows common law, common sense. Did you see MSNBC officially
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.460]  in ads now say that the state basically owns your children?
[02:46:11.460 --> 02:46:16.020]  No, no, I didn't see that. I'm sorry, your phone's breaking up.
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:21.220]  I've been up at the Capitol 24 seven, so I have not seen NBC.
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:25.380]  Well, no, no, I mean, this happened a while back. It's just that they're getting more
[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:26.380]  bold.
[02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:27.380]  Absolutely.
[02:46:27.380 --> 02:46:31.260]  So, so do you know how many votes they have? I mean, is it a closed vote or what's going
[02:46:31.260 --> 02:46:32.260]  on?
[02:46:32.260 --> 02:46:37.460]  We don't know yet. I mean, it's just gonna be a general vote. We are working with some
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:44.220]  other groups that have blanketed the Capitol with some fliers, with some points like the
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:51.340]  Home School Coalition, the Texas Home School Coalition, also the National Vaccine Information
[02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:58.300]  Center. The local Texas vaccine group is parents requesting open vaccine education, PROVE crew.
[02:46:58.300 --> 02:47:05.300]  They've been working hard on it. But the other side is very strong. They've got more
[02:47:05.300 --> 02:47:08.740]  money. All of us are working, you know, we're volunteers. And so the other side is coming
[02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:12.500]  from, you know, the doctors and the hospitals and the pharmaceutical companies. They have
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:18.180]  a lot of money that they put into these vaccination campaigns. So, and they spew out a lot of,
[02:47:18.180 --> 02:47:22.620]  you know, dangerous, scary statistics to these representatives. And I think that the representatives,
[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:27.540]  they have a good heart a lot of times and want to do the right thing. But I think that
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:32.780]  they're kind of wowed and wooed, you know, bamboozled by the statistics. We don't have
[02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:38.700]  an HPV epidemic going on in our state where, you know, girls are just dropping dead from
[02:47:38.700 --> 02:47:44.020]  cancer because they didn't get their HPV vaccine. They have no numbers like that proving that
[02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:48.700]  we have people dying, you know, by the millions from the flu or any of these other vaccines.
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:53.620]  They give people 20 times the vaccines they did in the 50s. They're filled with every
[02:47:53.620 --> 02:47:58.180]  horrible thing. The UN's been caught adding steroids to it on record. Anybody can look
[02:47:58.180 --> 02:48:03.560]  it up. This government with its history of secret experimentation cannot be trusted to
[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:09.460]  do anything. So everybody in Texas who doesn't want to have their kids forcibly inoculated
[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:12.860]  because that's what they do. They convince them, oh, you want the shot? You want the
[02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:15.300]  lollipop? I mean, this is just amazing.
[02:48:15.300 --> 02:48:21.220]  And I was afraid of my doctor. Kids are like, okay, this is the doctor. He must know best.
[02:48:21.220 --> 02:48:24.780]  And so you're going to do whatever the doctor, I mean, it's a warranty problem here. You're
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:28.220]  going to put this kid under his authority that they don't understand that they have
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:29.220]  a choice.
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:36.100]  No, exactly. It lets the government bully your child into doing whatever they want.
[02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:40.820]  I mean, government sets up checkpoints now and searches everyone's bags illegally with
[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:46.980]  guys in uniforms and guns. Now, have you seen the forced inoculations they've done in Maryland
[02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:51.580]  where they have the police in riot gear and barking dogs and say it's the law when it's
[02:48:51.580 --> 02:48:52.580]  not?
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:57.060]  And in a giant exercise of brute fraud, they give them the injections?
[02:48:57.060 --> 02:49:02.720]  And this is the level that they start at. They start with kind of a low level coercion
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.640]  kind of under people's noses. It's for your own good. And then they're just going to work
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:12.980]  up from there. The next step would be requiring these vaccines and then taking away our choice.
[02:49:12.980 --> 02:49:16.420]  A bunch of states are doing that now, yes.
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:21.740]  Right. We don't want Texas to be one of them. And so if we fight back now, see the law that
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:27.140]  passed in California that let children consent to immunizations was specifically for STDs.
[02:49:27.140 --> 02:49:32.540]  Now, of course, we're opposed to that as well. But this law in Texas, 1340, is more expansive.
[02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:38.540]  It does not say just for STDs. It just says for immunizations, period. So that's going
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:44.540]  to be any immunization they want to give our kids. We need to stop it. And I think people
[02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:48.940]  have the power to stop it. They don't know that they have the power. The representatives
[02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:55.100]  listen when you start bombarding their offices with phone calls, they listen and they get
[02:49:55.100 --> 02:49:59.220]  afraid to vote for something that's bad and they pull back on it.
[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:04.580]  And that's what we need today. But the American people are so passive now. That's why we've
[02:50:04.580 --> 02:50:10.180]  become so enslaved. Texas is still free to a great extent because people are instinctively
[02:50:10.180 --> 02:50:15.240]  wary of government. But Austin has been colonized by Californians. A lot of them are my friends,
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:20.140]  but people fleeing California. But now the second wave are here saying this is California.
[02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:25.100]  I've actually had Californians tell me that, you're one of those Texans. We're going to
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:29.300]  show you. And it's like, my God, you're going to show me? I mean, it's just bizarre.
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:35.580]  Yes, please don't bring your California law to Texas. We're all in trouble.
[02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:39.460]  It's just it's like a cult, man. It's a cult. All right, well, you're doing great work over
[02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:44.100]  there at parentsguidancecenter.org. Everybody should check it out. Judy Powell will get
[02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:48.140]  you in studio sometime with good audio. Great job down there at the Capitol. We'll see what

[02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:56.100]  That's one of my wife's friends. Great lady. All right. We'll be right back, ladies and
[02:50:56.100 --> 02:51:00.740]  gentlemen, on the other side of this break with more on Benghazi, the armed march on

[02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:08.900]  could happen to your assets and hard-earned money? Are you looking for a better way of
[02:53:08.900 --> 02:53:13.420]  life with more freedom, security and asset protection? If you answered yes to any of
[02:53:13.420 --> 02:53:18.480]  these questions, you should consider investing in the country of Belize. Belize is an independent
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:23.420]  English-speaking country only hours from the U.S. with strong banking and asset protection
[02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:28.700]  laws. In fact, Belize is one of the last tax havens left in the world today. Belize also

[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:43.900]  This is
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:49.080]  Al-Qaeda against Libya and Syria while taking our rights because of the Al-Qaeda threat,
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:53.360]  you know you're in trouble. If Congress can be having hearings about, they've already
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:56.880]  begun to take federal pension funds, they've already spent them, you're still getting fiat
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:54:59.040]  checks but the money's gone.
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:04.480]  That's been given to foreign banks. If they can take pension funds, I mean, my God, you're
[02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:11.520]  talking about the end of society as we know it, the end of confidence in the system. I
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:15.960]  have so many reporters say to me, Alex, you're gonna destroy confidence in America. America's
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:21.480]  being destroyed by the globalists, they're destroying the confidence.
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:26.360]  My confidence, my reliance is on common sense because history has shown any government big
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:33.320]  enough to give you anything you want will take everything you've got. That's just the
[02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:38.800]  way the world works. Look how jealous and envious and non-sharing the average person
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:46.160]  is even if they're not a bad person. People just cannot share. I have done probably ten
[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:50.960]  different media deals with people over the years, financing films, you name it.
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:58.480]  And in no case did they ever pay unless I controlled the money. Everyone that's done
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:04.040]  business with me has been paid exactly what they were owed or more. Every other person
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:10.840]  I've worked with would not pay me and would destroy a relationship because they couldn't
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:16.280]  give people the money. Hollywood, even big shows like Doomsday Preppers, they don't have
[02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:17.800]  paid crew now on them.
[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:21.880]  They have all these Hollywood people and camera folks who will work for free. It's the same
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:26.640]  thing with a lot of the people that do roadie work and stuff. Used to get paid a lot, then
[02:56:26.640 --> 02:56:29.940]  it was paid a little, then it's okay, well, work for free for a while to prove you'll
[02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:30.940]  do it.
[02:56:30.940 --> 02:56:35.800]  I'm talking about some college, yeah, work for a t-shirt. I'm not talking about people
[02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:39.840]  that have never been a roadie, that don't know sound, that don't know light. I mean
[02:56:39.840 --> 02:56:44.000]  good people. That's a race to the bottom. That's not building a culture. That's not
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:49.560]  building a civilization. The globalists are totally cutthroat, folks. You can build a
[02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:57.280]  true free market of excellence where people demand better and better and you build a civilization.
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:02.280]  We're going the opposite direction. And everyone knows this. And then I think about secret
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:08.920]  geoengineering programs partially declassified and just the sci-fi-ness of what we're in.
[02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:14.160]  And who knows what we don't know about? The average bureaucrat, the average even billionaire,
[02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:19.680]  the average senator doesn't even know what's going on. This, because it's so complex, even
[02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:23.880]  though it's all public, most of it, no one even in power will look at it cuz they're
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:30.080]  too busy doing their specialized job to go have sex with their mistress or go play golf.
[02:57:30.080 --> 02:57:36.000]  Or go to a gala and be a narcissist and wave at people. I mean, that's what they're into.
[02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.720]  I am into how the world really works. I am immersed in what's going on. And I have the
[02:57:40.720 --> 02:57:46.160]  quasi photographic memory over the years to be able to integrate it and the historical
[02:57:46.160 --> 02:57:51.880]  lens. And now I can report to you that it wasn't hard.
[02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:57.820]  This stuff is hiding in plain view at point blank range. We'll cover the Benghazi hearings
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:58:01.680]  tomorrow. We'll get into everything. The police have confirmed in England that yes, Bilderberg
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:06.520]  is there this year. I'm going. Everybody needs to be there. There's incredible news at info
