[00:00.000 --> 00:08.760]  It's Thursday, May 16, 2019, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08.760 --> 00:14.040]  President Trump is going to lose in 2020 big time, unless he takes action on four critical
[00:14.040 --> 00:16.000]  areas immediately.
[00:16.000 --> 00:20.200]  After this important report from Mark Dice, I'll lay it all out when we kick off the second
[00:20.200 --> 00:22.160]  segment of this live transmission.
[00:22.160 --> 00:26.800]  But first, Trump is starting to make some major progress on one of the big fronts.
[00:26.800 --> 00:29.000]  And that censorship, here's Mark Dice.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.400]  Well, the good news is, the White House just released a new tool for people to submit detailed
[00:33.400 --> 00:38.120]  reports about being censored on social media, including what the post was about and what
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.760]  platform it was on.
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.640]  But the bad news is, at least as of now, there is no direct link to the form on the White
[00:45.640 --> 00:46.840]  House official website.
[00:46.840 --> 00:50.320]  Hopefully that'll change very soon, and I'm going to tweet to Dan Scavino, the White
[00:50.320 --> 00:54.640]  House social media manager, and let him know that the main page is missing a link to the
[00:54.640 --> 00:55.640]  form.
[00:55.640 --> 00:59.960]  So for now, if you're going to WhiteHouse.gov slash TechBias, it'll take you to this page,
[00:59.960 --> 01:04.560]  which reads, social media platforms should advance freedom of speech, yet too many Americans
[01:04.560 --> 01:09.160]  have seen their accounts suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear, quote,
[01:09.160 --> 01:11.360]  violations of user policies.
[01:11.360 --> 01:15.880]  No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against
[01:15.880 --> 01:18.560]  you, share your story with President Trump.
[01:18.560 --> 01:22.200]  It then takes you to a page where you can fill out your personal details and explain
[01:22.200 --> 01:28.280]  what happened, and best of all, submit screenshots that the social media company sent to you
[01:28.280 --> 01:32.840]  about the particular post that was banned or the account that they took down.
[01:32.840 --> 01:36.360]  Well, as soon as I'm done recording this video, I think I'm going to have to let the president
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.720]  know that Instagram censored this Jussie Smollett Scooby-Doo meme about who was really behind
[01:41.720 --> 01:43.720]  the supposed crime.
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.400]  Good thing I saved this screenshot of the notification they sent me, too, telling me
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.760]  my post had been deleted because it was bullying Jussie Smollett, it was bullying him.
[01:52.760 --> 01:56.160]  And look at this, and the notifications that Instagram sends you when they take down your
[01:56.160 --> 02:01.880]  posts, they actually blur the very post in the notification, but if you just look closely
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.120]  at it, you can obviously tell that's the post that it was.
[02:05.120 --> 02:09.240]  I'm also going to have to let them know that Facebook suspended me for a week after I criticized
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.560]  the Dove soap company's commercial featuring real moms when they included a transgender
[02:15.560 --> 02:22.960]  woman in the ad with her new baby and she identified as the child's mom.
[02:22.960 --> 02:24.720]  We are both his biological parents.
[02:24.720 --> 02:27.120]  You get people that are like, what do you mean, you're the mom?
[02:27.120 --> 02:28.120]  We're like, what?
[02:28.120 --> 02:30.120]  We're both going to be moms.
[02:30.120 --> 02:35.800]  Yes, just saying that it's abnormal that this biological man who identifies as a woman
[02:35.800 --> 02:43.080]  also identifies as his new baby's mother is considered to be hate speech on Facebook.
[02:43.080 --> 02:45.560]  I'm sorry, but you're not that poor baby's mother.
[02:45.560 --> 02:47.280]  Two plus two does not equal five.
[02:47.280 --> 02:51.480]  I don't care what the big tech company say or what the Supreme Court has ruled, you can't
[02:51.480 --> 02:52.480]  tell me what to think.
[02:52.480 --> 02:57.000]  Oh, and then there was the time Twitter suspended me for calling Kevin Spacey a scumbag and
[02:57.000 --> 02:58.440]  told him to go to hell.
[02:58.440 --> 03:00.480]  That was bullying a poor gay man.
[03:00.480 --> 03:04.920]  And speaking of censorship, YouTube did remove the video of the 14-year-old child prodigy
[03:04.920 --> 03:10.640]  soap from her channel where she dressed up as a Muslim and denounced political correctness
[03:10.640 --> 03:13.040]  and social justice warriors.
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.080]  This video has been removed for violating YouTube's policy on hate speech.
[03:18.080 --> 03:21.600]  The video had been up on her channel, I think, for several weeks and had about a quarter
[03:21.600 --> 03:27.840]  million views until BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein, a social media hall monitor, published this
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.040]  article calling for her to be banned from YouTube.
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.680]  And as Twitter feed, he says, I've been covering this stuff for a while now.
[03:34.680 --> 03:38.720]  And Sof's videos are among the most shocking things that I've ever seen.
[03:38.720 --> 03:41.840]  I don't think you could watch this stuff without concluding.
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.440]  There's a moral crisis at YouTube.
[03:44.440 --> 03:48.960]  The good news is Sof is approaching a million subscribers because of all the new publicity.
[03:48.960 --> 03:52.480]  The bad news is I think she's locked out of her account for two weeks because of the strikes
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.120]  and who knows how much longer YouTube will even allow her to have a channel.
[03:56.120 --> 04:00.880]  They don't want a 14-year-old child prodigy who denounces political correctness, feminism,
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.200]  and censorship on social media to have a voice on social media.
[04:05.200 --> 04:09.640]  Meanwhile, the liberal media like the New York Times and Good Morning America are celebrating
[04:09.640 --> 04:16.680]  the 11-year-old drag kid, an 11-year-old boy whose parents dressed him up in drag and
[04:16.680 --> 04:22.240]  take him to gay bars where he does simulated strip teases while men throw dollar bills at
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.240]  him.
[04:23.240 --> 04:26.080]  I'm not going to show you that video because it's beyond horrifying, but here he is on
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.360]  Good Morning America being celebrated for being amazing.
[04:30.360 --> 04:35.280]  And while YouTube recently disabled the comments on all kids' videos because a bunch of pedos
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.080]  were hanging out in the comments section, of course they still allow the comments section
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.640]  to be active on Desmond isAmazing's channel.
[04:43.640 --> 04:44.920]  All right, great job, Mark Dice.
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.880]  Full report up on infowars.com and, of course, markdice.com.
[04:48.880 --> 04:50.080]  Get ready when we come back.
[04:50.080 --> 04:56.960]  If Trump doesn't do four things, he's going to lose in 2020 and so are we big time stalling
[04:56.960 --> 05:01.360]  our populist global revolution.
[05:01.360 --> 05:05.560]  Eating your protein has never been easier with infowars life protein bars.

[06:25.200 --> 06:43.320]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[06:43.320 --> 06:49.800]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't
[06:49.800 --> 06:50.800]  control.
[06:50.800 --> 06:51.800]  UFOs.
[06:51.800 --> 06:56.240]  This global governance at last is in one world, the central bank is in charge.
[06:56.240 --> 07:00.920]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S. naval officers say it was
[07:00.920 --> 07:01.920]  on purpose.
[07:01.920 --> 07:05.280]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.800]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[07:10.800 --> 07:11.800]  Russian scum.
[07:11.800 --> 07:12.800]  He denied everything.
[07:12.800 --> 07:13.800]  He called it all fake news.
[07:13.800 --> 07:14.800]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[07:14.800 --> 07:15.800]  This is a national emergency.
[07:15.800 --> 07:22.800]  If they killed Trump or removed Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[07:22.800 --> 07:23.800]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[07:23.800 --> 07:24.800]  We are at war with Russia.
[07:24.800 --> 07:25.800]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian
[07:25.800 --> 07:26.800]  Assange and WikiLeaks?
[07:26.800 --> 07:28.520]  The White House and the President are citing infowars.
[07:28.520 --> 07:42.540]  They can shut us down your next.
[07:42.540 --> 07:47.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[07:47.440 --> 07:51.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:51.640 --> 07:53.560]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[07:53.560 --> 07:58.280]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[07:58.280 --> 08:02.120]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[08:02.120 --> 08:06.200]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[08:06.200 --> 08:09.200]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.900]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Lewis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all
[08:13.900 --> 08:16.880]  of them were designated dangerous.
[08:16.880 --> 08:17.880]  Dangerous?
[08:17.880 --> 08:18.880]  Dangerous.
[08:18.880 --> 08:19.880]  Dangerous people.
[08:19.880 --> 08:20.880]  Dangerous individuals.
[08:20.880 --> 08:21.880]  Dangerous individuals.
[08:21.880 --> 08:22.880]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[08:22.880 --> 08:23.880]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[08:23.880 --> 08:24.880]  Danger, Will Robinson.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.880]  Danger.
[08:25.880 --> 08:26.880]  They call me dangerous.
[08:26.880 --> 08:27.880]  Danger is my middle name.
[08:27.880 --> 08:28.880]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[08:28.880 --> 08:29.880]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[08:29.880 --> 08:30.880]  This is about the total rollout.
[08:30.880 --> 08:43.320]  How dangerous is infowars?
[08:43.320 --> 08:47.840]  What is the difference, right, at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.520]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[08:50.520 --> 08:53.040]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.720]  Infowars' content is useful to him.
[08:55.720 --> 08:57.640]  Infowars' personalities align with him.
[08:57.640 --> 08:58.640]  I want them shut down.
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.640]  I want them silenced.
[08:59.640 --> 09:00.640]  I want them muted.
[09:00.640 --> 09:02.520]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[09:02.520 --> 09:04.240]  I want them shut down.
[09:04.240 --> 09:05.240]  I want them silenced.
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.240]  I want them muted.
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.240]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[09:10.240 --> 09:16.040]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.440]  highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[09:20.440 --> 09:26.040]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate
[09:26.040 --> 09:29.360]  our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[09:29.360 --> 09:33.760]  Through your rules, your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[09:33.760 --> 09:36.880]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[09:36.880 --> 09:41.040]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[09:41.040 --> 09:43.640]  We need a digital bill of rights.
[09:43.640 --> 09:47.520]  They're becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[09:47.520 --> 09:51.040]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.680]  companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[09:54.680 --> 09:55.840]  You are a bad person.
[09:55.840 --> 09:57.440]  You should be censored off the internet.
[09:57.440 --> 09:58.440]  Bad, yes.
[09:58.440 --> 09:59.440]  Get out of here, Alex.
[09:59.440 --> 10:03.120]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over
[10:03.120 --> 10:04.120]  at Trump's pluriphy.
[10:04.120 --> 10:10.200]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to
[10:10.200 --> 10:13.120]  say, that Infowars president.
[10:13.120 --> 10:17.600]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[10:17.600 --> 10:40.680]  What an exciting time to be alive, my friends.
[10:40.680 --> 10:47.040]  Thursday, May 16th, 2019, I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be here for
[10:47.040 --> 10:49.680]  the next four hours live broadcasting worldwide.
[10:49.680 --> 10:53.680]  And of course, I was Troy with the war room is coming up right after that.
[10:53.680 --> 10:59.240]  David Knight is here weekday mornings from 8am to 11am, right before I go live.
[10:59.240 --> 11:02.480]  We are live on this Thursday, global edition.
[11:02.480 --> 11:08.520]  So if you go to infowars.com or newswars.com, every day when the show goes live, we post
[11:08.520 --> 11:14.240]  an article that has a live video and audio feed in it that really encapsulates what the
[11:14.240 --> 11:17.600]  top story at least at the start of the show is.
[11:17.600 --> 11:32.600]  And that is the fact that President Trump is going to lose in 2020.
[11:32.600 --> 11:42.600]  If he doesn't do four things that absolutely need to happen.
[11:42.600 --> 11:48.160]  And so I tend to cover really important issues here, just kind of throw them out there.
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.280]  Then he gets mixed in with all the other news and information, so I'm going to wait until
[11:53.280 --> 11:54.280]  the next segment.
[11:54.280 --> 11:55.720]  I'm going to lay these four things out.
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.680]  We've already talked about these four things a lot.
[11:57.680 --> 11:59.760]  I'm sure you'll agree with these four things.
[11:59.760 --> 12:02.640]  And I intend to open the phones up and say, are there other things you'd like to add because
[12:02.640 --> 12:10.240]  I'm going to shoot a special report this weekend to the president with graphics and documentation
[12:10.240 --> 12:12.560]  that I know will end up getting to the president.
[12:12.560 --> 12:18.920]  He likes five-minute-long briefings, and we're going to get it into his hands dealing with
[12:18.920 --> 12:33.840]  the massive, unparalleled, just incredible, amazing levels of criminal activity going
[12:33.840 --> 12:36.640]  on in this country.
[12:36.640 --> 12:44.400]  But really the fact that if he thinks the revolution to overturn his election was serious,
[12:44.400 --> 12:51.480]  he ain't seen nothing yet, and neither have we.
[12:51.480 --> 12:57.520]  So I'm going to do my best to lay that out and then get to all the other news.
[12:57.520 --> 13:01.560]  We come back and I'm going to open the phones up today to get your specific take on what
[13:01.560 --> 13:09.280]  you think needs to happen in 2020 and what curveballs you think the establishment are
[13:09.280 --> 13:10.280]  going to be throwing.
[13:10.280 --> 13:15.680]  And I'm going to try to be as calm as I can because once I plunge into the news and information
[13:15.680 --> 13:20.280]  I get in a hurry to try to cover every facet, and I tend to miss the forest for the trees
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.560]  as we all know, but this is really, really critical information that's coming up.
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.640]  So however you're listening, however you're watching, please get others to tune in because
[13:30.640 --> 13:33.000]  it's vital this information get out.
[13:33.000 --> 13:35.600]  The establishment wants us off air for a reason.
[13:35.600 --> 13:39.560]  They know we've got their number and know how to defeat them.
[13:39.560 --> 13:40.560]  Okay.
[13:40.560 --> 13:44.920]  That said, also, we are listeners supported.
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.480]  You have seen the unprecedented draconian attempts to destroy us.
[13:50.480 --> 13:55.800]  Only your word of mouth has overcome their attempts to block our transmissions, only
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.760]  the support of our great AM and FM affiliates as well, and your diligence out there spreading
[14:00.760 --> 14:01.960]  the word.
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.440]  But also financially, you hear radio stations have sponsors and the GCN network we're on
[14:06.440 --> 14:09.760]  has some sponsors, but that's not what funds our operation.
[14:09.760 --> 14:18.480]  It's you directly buying products at infowarstore.com and we make it very, very easy.
[14:18.480 --> 14:22.320]  We have the best supplements, the best vitamins, the best nutraceuticals out there you're
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.120]  going to find, period.
[14:24.120 --> 14:32.560]  And we have great books and films and t-shirts and a lot of other important information.
[14:32.560 --> 14:38.360]  And it's just an ongoing fight to keep this place afloat in the face of what the establishment
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.560]  has been trying to do.
[14:39.560 --> 14:40.800]  And I'm not complaining.
[14:40.800 --> 14:42.200]  I'm not a victim.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.800]  We're targets.
[14:43.800 --> 14:48.880]  And so I would just encourage everyone to understand that just like our information is game changing
[14:48.880 --> 14:55.720]  and accurate and over the horizon radar, the products we've got are amazing as well.
[14:55.720 --> 14:57.800]  I mean, just take our Wake Up America coffee.
[14:57.800 --> 15:00.080]  I think it's the best coffee I've ever had.
[15:00.080 --> 15:03.800]  I found that I could get it organic while harvested from southern Mexico right on the
[15:03.800 --> 15:08.400]  Guatemala border from the Chiapas people, and we've been selling it for 10 years.
[15:08.400 --> 15:10.360]  It's super popular.
[15:10.360 --> 15:16.000]  The same stuff sold in Whole Foods under another name for five to $10 more a pound.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.800]  So WakeUpAmericaCoffee at infowarstore.com.

[15:46.480 --> 15:47.480]  Two different types.

[15:53.000 --> 15:54.880]  the Republic from enemies far and domestic.

[15:55.880 --> 15:58.360]  We'll be back with the four things Trump must do.
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.600]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[16:01.600 --> 16:02.600]  Better grab some flowers, too.

[16:08.320 --> 16:09.640]  in case she wants to return.
[16:09.640 --> 16:11.120]  You know there's an easier way, right?

[17:33.960 --> 17:34.960]  the world.
[17:34.960 --> 17:37.960]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.920]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.920 --> 17:47.720]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.720 --> 17:48.720]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.720 --> 17:50.280]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.280 --> 17:56.840]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[17:56.840 --> 17:57.840]  at Amazon Books.
[17:57.840 --> 18:07.480]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[18:07.480 --> 18:12.200]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[18:12.200 --> 18:17.480]  Faced off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've

[18:58.160 --> 19:07.040]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[19:07.040 --> 19:08.040]  Good to talk to you.
[19:08.040 --> 19:11.840]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally
[19:11.840 --> 19:12.840]  take vitamins at all.
[19:12.840 --> 19:14.920]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.080]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I
[19:19.080 --> 19:20.080]  trust.
[19:20.080 --> 19:23.160]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they
[19:23.160 --> 19:26.320]  say that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate
[19:26.320 --> 19:27.320]  that.
[19:27.320 --> 19:28.320]  What about the ultimate female force?
[19:28.320 --> 19:29.320]  Tell us about it.
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.320]  Well, it's really great.
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.320]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[19:31.320 --> 19:32.320]  I take it.
[19:32.320 --> 19:33.320]  It tastes good.
[19:33.320 --> 19:34.320]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[19:34.320 --> 19:35.320]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[19:35.320 --> 19:39.320]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like
[19:39.320 --> 19:40.320]  it.
[19:40.320 --> 19:42.400]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[19:42.400 --> 19:46.200]  They're known to turbocharge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[19:46.200 --> 19:52.400]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[19:52.400 --> 20:03.520]  I'm glad you plugged it, infoorstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[20:03.520 --> 20:31.080]  Thanks for listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.520 --> 20:45.800]  Welcome back, my friends.
[20:45.800 --> 20:49.680]  Alex Jones here on this Thursday, May 16, 2019 broadcast.
[20:49.680 --> 20:53.120]  We've got some really important, informative guests today.
[20:53.120 --> 20:55.000]  I tend to open the phones up.
[20:55.000 --> 21:00.560]  Starting in the next segment, I'll give the number out and so much more, but let me right
[21:00.560 --> 21:09.680]  now lay out four big pillars that if the president doesn't act decisively on these, he doesn't
[21:09.680 --> 21:10.680]  have a hope.
[21:10.680 --> 21:11.680]  He doesn't have a prayer.
[21:11.680 --> 21:16.840]  He doesn't have a chance in hell of winning the 2020 election.
[21:16.840 --> 21:23.920]  Now, it's not a status symbol or something to brag about that the president knows that
[21:23.920 --> 21:29.400]  we cover a lot of accurate information that the president obviously retweets and promotes
[21:29.400 --> 21:31.120]  info wars.
[21:31.120 --> 21:32.520]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[21:32.520 --> 21:36.960]  They think he just won't get that advice anymore if we're off the air.
[21:36.960 --> 21:42.680]  Well, I mean, the jigs up, the general population, other talk show hosts understand the real
[21:42.680 --> 21:47.720]  paradigm of deep state, global governance, who the players are, what the philosophies
[21:47.720 --> 21:48.720]  are.
[21:48.720 --> 21:51.040]  So there's no really putting that genie back in the bottle.
[21:51.040 --> 21:54.800]  I don't want to say we've outlived our usefulness, but let's just say this.
[21:54.800 --> 22:00.720]  This audience supporting us, helping us relaunch Americana, real politic, how the world really
[22:00.720 --> 22:03.480]  works has changed the world.
[22:03.480 --> 22:05.360]  And so I salute all of you.
[22:05.360 --> 22:12.040]  Now that said, it's up to us now to just keep hammering this to the president, keep hammering
[22:12.040 --> 22:16.640]  this to Congress, and more and more members of the House, more members of the Senate are
[22:16.640 --> 22:24.720]  saying exactly what we're saying because what we're saying is common sense.
[22:24.720 --> 22:30.480]  But most people, even good conservatives in Congress, get caught up in the tar babies
[22:30.480 --> 22:35.400]  of the topics and the subjects that mainstream corporate media puts out.
[22:35.400 --> 22:42.560]  And so we get sucked in to their fantasy lens instead of looking at the facts.
[22:42.560 --> 22:46.200]  So here's the four pillars, then I'll walk through them.
[22:46.200 --> 22:51.240]  Number one is communications and election integrity.
[22:51.240 --> 22:55.560]  So I'll call that one pillar.
[22:55.560 --> 23:01.440]  Communications of the American people, the capacity to communicate beyond just free speech,
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.040]  just communications.
[23:05.040 --> 23:10.680]  And that ties into election integrity and the Democrats, long history of election meddling
[23:10.680 --> 23:13.600]  and the fact that they've been caught in the last election doing it and have been trying
[23:13.600 --> 23:20.600]  to overturn this election and are now involved in draconian level censorship at a level never
[23:20.600 --> 23:22.920]  before seen in the world.
[23:22.920 --> 23:26.640]  Big tech at the behest of the Democrats in deep state has outstripped anything with chai
[23:26.640 --> 23:28.280]  comms we've even done yet.
[23:28.280 --> 23:33.080]  And of course, I'm the test case along with a few others.
[23:33.080 --> 23:34.240]  So that's where we are right now.
[23:34.240 --> 23:44.360]  If the president doesn't act on censorship and on massive manipulation, he will have
[23:44.360 --> 23:46.440]  the 2020 election stolen.
[23:46.440 --> 23:50.080]  There's no doubt he's going to win all the numbers show landslide.
[23:50.080 --> 23:53.540]  He had a landslide in 2016.
[23:53.540 --> 23:58.640]  We predicted a landslide, but I said the wave is going to be partially blocked by a sea
[23:58.640 --> 24:03.400]  wall of fraud and people voting the names of the dead and fake polls.
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.320]  So it's got to be a massive tsunami to make it over the sea wall.
[24:07.320 --> 24:08.320]  It barely did.
[24:08.320 --> 24:16.280]  I mean, there were some CNN polls, they were sampling 30 plus points for Democrats against
[24:16.280 --> 24:17.280]  Trump.
[24:17.280 --> 24:19.760]  And so, of course, Hillary was winning by 67%.
[24:19.760 --> 24:23.440]  It was to create that bandwagon effect, that giant fraud effect.
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.600]  On average, they were sampling 15 points more for Democrats.
[24:26.600 --> 24:28.240]  And remember the death of the election.
[24:28.240 --> 24:30.640]  Why were the polls all wrong?
[24:30.640 --> 24:37.200]  They think two years later, soon to be four years later, you won't have a memory.
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.920]  So Trump has to step up to the plate and fight the election.
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.360]  Fraud that's already unfolding, people voting the names of the dead, the attacks on free
[24:47.360 --> 24:48.360]  speech.
[24:48.360 --> 24:52.680]  We've got to have communications and we've got to have real integrity in elections to
[24:52.680 --> 24:59.440]  block the feverish cheating and corruption we've already seen from the Democrats.
[24:59.440 --> 25:00.440]  So that's the number one pillar.
[25:00.440 --> 25:04.640]  Communications, the integrity of the election, I put that together.
[25:04.640 --> 25:08.600]  And again, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, instant messaging.
[25:08.600 --> 25:12.840]  Now they want WhatsApp that helped the new leader of Brazil get elected.
[25:12.840 --> 25:16.920]  They don't want conservatives to be able to text person to person.
[25:16.920 --> 25:18.680]  They're having CNN investigative reports.
[25:18.680 --> 25:20.200]  Does Jones have one?
[25:20.200 --> 25:22.040]  Is he talking to people on it?
[25:22.040 --> 25:24.480]  Ban him.
[25:24.480 --> 25:29.080]  Because they know, as I've been saying for a year, text messages, send out our articles
[25:29.080 --> 25:30.420]  on text messages.
[25:30.420 --> 25:32.120]  They'll open them way more often.
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.120]  It's the way you get around the censors.
[25:33.120 --> 25:38.080]  Well, now they're trying to go in and saying, well, AT&T might block conservative tweets
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.040]  or conservative texts or, oh, WhatsApp's already starting.
[25:44.040 --> 25:46.440]  It's here, beyond 1924.
[25:46.440 --> 25:48.760]  So that's the number one pillar.
[25:48.760 --> 25:53.520]  And we'll flesh out what we think the president should do and some of the actions he's now
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.920]  taking when we come back.
[25:54.920 --> 25:56.880]  But let's get to the other three pillars quickly.
[25:56.880 --> 26:02.240]  Number of communications, integrity of election, and the fact that most people communicate
[26:02.240 --> 26:09.040]  now over Facebook, over Twitter, over apps, which are being surveilled and controlled in
[26:09.040 --> 26:11.080]  real time.
[26:11.080 --> 26:14.880]  So we've got to have integrity of just communications in this country for the people to communicate
[26:14.880 --> 26:21.120]  for us to have our populist message win.
[26:21.120 --> 26:24.480]  Number two, and Trump's already taken action on this to a great extent, but you watch the
[26:24.480 --> 26:27.800]  Federal Reserve, it's private, foreign-owned, it's going to sneak attack.
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.160]  The Chicombs own part of it, basically, and now they're dumping U.S. Treasuries.
[26:32.160 --> 26:33.160]  That's good.
[26:33.160 --> 26:35.120]  They should just divest and get out of it.
[26:35.120 --> 26:36.120]  But we're in a real war.
[26:36.120 --> 26:42.480]  And there's going to be economic warfare trying to sabotage the economy ahead of the election.
[26:42.480 --> 26:43.480]  That's obvious.
[26:43.480 --> 26:44.480]  Trump knows that.
[26:44.480 --> 26:48.400]  He's already grabbed the establishment by the shorthairs.
[26:48.400 --> 26:53.640]  He's already let them know that he understands what's happening and unfolding.
[26:53.640 --> 27:01.280]  So they did eight hikes and interest rates in the first year of Trump, year and a half.
[27:01.280 --> 27:03.040]  They never did one under Obama.
[27:03.040 --> 27:06.040]  And again, that was to kill this recovery.
[27:06.040 --> 27:11.720]  Once the economy got up to 4.8%, they totally panicked to drive it back down.
[27:11.720 --> 27:15.200]  Trump threatened to remove the leadership of the Federal Reserve and exercise power for
[27:15.200 --> 27:18.920]  the first time in 105 years over the private group that has the name federal.
[27:18.920 --> 27:19.920]  That's all.
[27:19.920 --> 27:20.920]  It's federal about it.
[27:20.920 --> 27:21.920]  So they backed off for now.
[27:21.920 --> 27:23.840]  But he's got to secure the economy.
[27:23.840 --> 27:25.480]  He's got to stand up for the economy.
[27:25.480 --> 27:28.760]  And he's got to understand they're going to try other tricks, try to plunge the markets
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.360]  and other things to blame him ahead of 2020, that we're going to be in the thick of the
[27:33.360 --> 27:35.040]  campaign in just six months.
[27:35.040 --> 27:40.200]  So that's number two, is secure the economy, realize the alien, globalist, federal reserve
[27:40.200 --> 27:45.600]  will run sneak attacks, so we need to continue to laze them politically, light them up with
[27:45.600 --> 27:49.120]  the spotlights that they know they're being watched.
[27:49.120 --> 27:52.840]  Then the President obviously has to secure the boards.
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.280]  And I kept saying declare a national emergency, but I meant a real national emergency as Commander
[27:57.280 --> 28:04.000]  in Chief, like Eisenhower did back in 1958, and actually secure the border when we have
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.680]  a collapsing border and we have hundreds of thousands of months getting caught coming
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.040]  in, we know of, overwhelming the courts, overwhelming ICE, and then they're releasing
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.200]  up to 10,000 every few days.
[28:16.200 --> 28:21.240]  It's a broken border, that's a collapsed country, and the American people, if you don't take
[28:21.240 --> 28:24.120]  the size of action, will know you've been involved in dereliction of duty.
[28:24.120 --> 28:26.040]  Okay, you got a few extra billion from the Pentagon.
[28:26.040 --> 28:30.280]  You're trying to put a band-aid on a leg that's cut off, you've got to put a tourniquet around
[28:30.280 --> 28:31.280]  it.
[28:31.280 --> 28:36.800]  So defend the borders, exercise executive power, declare a real national emergency, not a law
[28:36.800 --> 28:41.640]  enforcement emergency on funding, a true national emergency under the Commander in Chief to
[28:41.640 --> 28:42.880]  defend our borders.
[28:42.880 --> 28:49.600]  And the fourth thing the President needs to do when we come back on the other side, remember
[28:49.600 --> 28:54.600]  the globalists work around the clock to stop these slinks going out, so get them out, newswords.com,
[28:54.600 --> 28:59.240]  prisonplanet.com, let's do this.

[29:13.960 --> 29:19.200]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[31:55.920 --> 31:57.920]  God bless you.
[32:25.920 --> 32:46.480]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com, we knew this censorship is coming forever.
[32:46.480 --> 32:50.240]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[32:50.240 --> 32:52.800]  Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[32:52.800 --> 32:56.480]  We'll go to infowars.com and newswars.com, that's where they find it.
[32:56.480 --> 33:03.080]  There's what things go websites, just go there.
[33:03.080 --> 33:22.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.080 --> 33:26.840]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.560]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:28.560 --> 33:43.000]  Well so does he, live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.280]  No brag, just fact.
[33:45.280 --> 33:51.320]  I am one of the earliest individuals other than Ann Coulter to predict that Donald Trump
[33:51.320 --> 33:56.920]  would become the nominee for president in 2016, I said that in 2015, and that he would
[33:56.920 --> 34:02.720]  end up winning the presidency, that there'd be a worldwide populist movement overriding
[34:02.720 --> 34:04.800]  the globalist.
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.240]  But isn't nationalism and free market and freedom a lot more popular than authoritarian
[34:11.240 --> 34:12.240]  globalism?
[34:12.240 --> 34:20.600]  I mean, I'm betting on humanity, but I could also basically see the tea leaves.
[34:20.600 --> 34:25.160]  And so, I've already covered, if you just joined us, the three pillars, but if you just
[34:25.160 --> 34:31.760]  tuned in, we've got to have communications for election integrity, if not it's election
[34:31.760 --> 34:32.760]  meddling.
[34:32.760 --> 34:37.720]  And under that is the whole crisis of people voting in the names of the dead, which is
[34:37.720 --> 34:41.400]  an official democratic policy for a hundred years, which is now done in an industrial
[34:41.400 --> 34:46.400]  organized scale, you got that.
[34:46.400 --> 34:49.840]  The Democrats run a holy jihad, they admit they're engaged in fraud, they admit they're
[34:49.840 --> 34:55.760]  letting legal aliens vote all over the country and all over the world.
[34:55.760 --> 34:59.680]  So we've got to have a stop to the censorship, at least to fight back, we've got to be aware
[34:59.680 --> 35:13.600]  of election fraud, that all goes under communications.
[35:13.600 --> 35:19.280]  Then of course we've got the attack on the economy, that's got to be stopped by the
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.120]  private Federal Reserve.
[35:21.120 --> 35:23.800]  And Trump's done that so far, but they're going to come back, you better believe it,
[35:23.800 --> 35:24.800]  they always do.
[35:24.800 --> 35:28.440]  And then of course we've got the open borders, the fact that it's his job and his duty to
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.360]  put the regular military there and to turn these people back and not let them overwhelm
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.080]  our asylum system, which they're doing by design and let all these diseases and the
[35:36.080 --> 35:41.760]  rest of it pour in that the system admits is happening.
[35:41.760 --> 35:47.920]  And then there's the fourth one, I don't like Venezuelan dictator Maduro, I don't
[35:47.920 --> 35:55.440]  like the Shiite-Iranian dictatorship and the clerics, but that said, I don't trust
[35:55.440 --> 36:01.360]  John Bolton, I don't trust the neocons, I don't trust the Democrats, and war is very
[36:01.360 --> 36:03.200]  unpopular with the American people.
[36:03.200 --> 36:09.920]  Sure, it might be popular while the bombs are dropping, people historically will get
[36:09.920 --> 36:11.240]  behind it.
[36:11.240 --> 36:18.440]  But right away, it really hurts the President, it hurts our military, it hurts the innocents
[36:18.440 --> 36:22.880]  that get killed in it, and a lot of times the problem that was already there gets a
[36:22.880 --> 36:29.480]  lot worse, look at Iraq, look at Syria, look at Libya.
[36:29.480 --> 36:37.360]  And so one of the biggest threats to the Trump presidency and to America's reboot and restart
[36:37.360 --> 36:38.360]  is the neocons.
[36:38.360 --> 36:45.960]  Now, I am very, very pleased that just today, the White House and the President has come
[36:45.960 --> 36:52.480]  out and said, we don't want war with Iran, but we are going to have tough sanctions,
[36:52.480 --> 36:57.480]  and we don't think the time is right to strike Iran, countermanding some of the neocon propaganda
[36:57.480 --> 36:58.480]  coming up.
[36:58.480 --> 37:05.160]  Here's some of the stories up on infowars.com, this is from zerohedge.com, Iran's military
[37:05.160 --> 37:14.920]  on cusp of war, close quote, as U.S. allies, whole troops from Iraq.
[37:14.920 --> 37:22.800]  Here's another one from information liberation, Washington Post, Trump frustrated by advisors
[37:22.800 --> 37:30.240]  is not convinced the time is right to attack Iran, Trump is not inclined to respond forcefully
[37:30.240 --> 37:39.040]  unless there is a big move from the Iranians, well, the Iranians are saying we're not attacking
[37:39.040 --> 37:43.920]  Saudi Arabian ships, we're not attacking you with drones, these are false flags.
[37:43.920 --> 37:48.040]  I don't tend to believe anything comes out of the Iranian's mouth, but they don't want
[37:48.040 --> 37:53.880]  a war, why would you then try to start one?
[37:53.880 --> 38:00.080]  Just like the last four chemical attacks in Syria, turned out our own government now admits
[38:00.080 --> 38:08.320]  were false flags staged by ISIS and the so-called white helmets to start a larger war and get
[38:08.320 --> 38:11.800]  us involved.
[38:11.800 --> 38:17.800]  Obviously Obama signaled all of that when he said, well, there's any chemicals used,
[38:17.800 --> 38:19.960]  that's a red line, we're going in to take you out.
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.080]  So there's a sod winning all these years, finally completely won thanks to Russia and
[38:24.080 --> 38:28.960]  the U.S. and Trump having a better policy, why the hell would he launch a chemical attack?
[38:28.960 --> 38:33.000]  Well, here's the thing, the globalists don't control the jihadis, they just fund them and
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.320]  protect a lot of them and let them in under the Democrats and McCain and Hillary and others.
[38:39.320 --> 38:44.760]  They all, all four chemical attacks, shot videos, we've already played all these just
[38:44.760 --> 38:50.720]  out of the news, of themselves screaming Allah Akbar and firing the chemical munitions via
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.520]  mortars because they're rock stars.
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.200]  When that's seen on the internet back home in Afghanistan or wherever, they get huge
[38:59.200 --> 39:01.080]  cash donations to their families.
[39:01.080 --> 39:03.720]  They're like Elvis Presley.
[39:03.720 --> 39:08.280]  When everybody sees that back home in Saudi Arabia or wherever they came from on their
[39:08.280 --> 39:15.520]  little hodge of jihad in the happy hunting ground of Syria.
[39:15.520 --> 39:18.680]  And so we've seen this over and over again and I just don't want there to be a big fat
[39:18.680 --> 39:28.280]  juicy false flag and we're off to war with Iran because Iran is not Iraq.
[39:28.280 --> 39:33.920]  I'm not putting Arabs down, Arabs I'm sure are wonderful people and they do have a war
[39:33.920 --> 39:39.600]  like, you know, history to them, a slaving history and so much more, but the Iranians
[39:39.600 --> 39:45.920]  are Persians and they have a whole different history of military attacks and actions and
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.520]  I can tell you the military I know going back over 10 years explained they already have
[39:50.520 --> 39:55.480]  nuclear weapons, they got them from Pakistan, they're getting delivery systems and we do
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.040]  not want to go to war with Iran but Saudi Arabia is going to push us into it and that's
[39:59.040 --> 40:06.840]  basically what's happening here and it's not a good situation.
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.040]  Most of your ISIS or al-Qaeda types are double agents in Western intelligence and with Saudi
[40:12.040 --> 40:13.040]  Arabia.
[40:13.040 --> 40:18.920]  A lot of them are radicals they believe what they're doing but they're still under Western
[40:18.920 --> 40:19.920]  control to a certain extent.
[40:19.920 --> 40:24.160]  That's why you'll see them sent off to attack a country and brought back into the West.
[40:24.160 --> 40:29.640]  That's not the case with Iran ladies and gentlemen in Hezbollah and they've got Iranian sleeper
[40:29.640 --> 40:40.680]  cells in every town and city who if there is a major attack on Iran are going to attack
[40:40.680 --> 40:46.400]  and they're going to attack not soft targets, they're going to attack military bases and
[40:46.400 --> 40:52.520]  police stations and here's a problem I said they don't double agent a lot except with
[40:52.520 --> 40:58.680]  Obama there was some double agenting and some deals and we've caught Iranian groups before
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.000]  staging events and preparing events, they're going to be blamed on right wing groups.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.520]  Show MS-13 is an auxiliary of the Democrats now.
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.960]  I told you that three years ago now it's admitted in mainstream news, FBI reports.
[41:10.960 --> 41:15.200]  Hezbollah does some cross work with Democrats in some of the deep state and so it can be
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.600]  used as cutout proxies to basically set up other decoys.
[41:21.600 --> 41:29.640]  So again this is a real politic briefing to the world ladies and gentlemen that the
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.480]  other big fourth pillar is we don't want to war with Iran.
[41:34.480 --> 41:39.480]  They're very close to toppling the mullahs through just cultural resistance, the people
[41:39.480 --> 41:44.560]  there don't want to be slaves and I just think we need to stay out of it.
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.720]  I'm a little more inclined towards action in my view, you can call and disagree, I'll
[41:48.720 --> 41:54.400]  remember out in a moment, in Venezuela and I'm not calling for action, I'm saying it's
[41:54.400 --> 41:57.400]  in northern South America.
[41:57.400 --> 42:01.400]  Central America has collapsed, they've set up UN bases to move the migrant groups into
[42:01.400 --> 42:10.360]  the U.S. that's a real collapsed society bordering us with a dictator with people massively suffering.
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.600]  So I'd like to see Maduro go and have real elections and stabilize that oil rich nation.
[42:15.600 --> 42:20.600]  I don't trust the neocons, they're like inbred mentally ill dogs or something just like
[42:20.600 --> 42:27.480]  Democrats, they can't ever seem to do good and so they would do either obey a pegs on
[42:27.480 --> 42:32.840]  Trump and mess up his operation to get him or they would put somebody in and it would
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.840]  just fall apart and then it's our whole new mess and I just, it's just a disaster anyway
[42:37.840 --> 42:38.840]  you slice it.
[42:38.840 --> 42:41.880]  So the answer is cut off all the funding in Central and South American countries that
[42:41.880 --> 42:46.480]  don't work with us, put the military on the border and secure that son of a bitch and if
[42:46.480 --> 42:51.560]  Mexico continues to open up corridors into the U.S. well then we have to invade Mexico
[42:51.560 --> 42:53.880]  20, 30 miles in, create a security perimeter.
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.880]  Otherwise I'm not joking, that's standard Pentagon doctrine to actually stop just this

[47:04.000 --> 47:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.000 --> 47:39.720]  One of the most censored people in the world is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[47:39.720 --> 47:43.840]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Tom Papert's going to pop in for a segment, he's a syndicated
[47:43.840 --> 47:47.920]  radio host and manages one of our fine TV affiliates.
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.880]  He got suspended from Facebook for doing the OK sign.
[47:52.880 --> 47:58.360]  That's right, the left find to do symbols every day to ban and persecute people as the
[47:58.360 --> 48:03.760]  thought police, but I went up in the phones up specifically on the four pillars I laid
[48:03.760 --> 48:07.760]  out of defending free speech for election integrity.
[48:07.760 --> 48:13.720]  That's number one, stopping election fraud, that all goes in one area, First Amendment,
[48:13.720 --> 48:17.000]  and then of course, defend the economy for the proud of the Federal Reserve, started
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.920]  been trying to spike it, and then of course, defend the borders, but don't let the neocons
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.240]  in the leftist get us into big giant wars, because it's the left today that once all
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.200]  these wars, they say Trump's this big war monger, but he's been trying to get us out
[48:30.200 --> 48:34.800]  of Afghanistan, has gotten us out of Syria, and so much more, I'm not just mindlessly
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.640]  defending Trump here, I'm simply defending reality and the facts.
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.880]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, toll-free number to join us.
[48:43.880 --> 48:55.080]  We're going to do first-time callers in this first round, 877-789-2539er, 877-789-ALEX
[48:55.080 --> 49:01.680]  on this Thursday, Global Broadcast will take your calls coming up in the next hour, into
[49:01.680 --> 49:07.760]  the third hour and fourth hour as well, with Matt Bracken, oh, he's a perfect guest, former
[49:07.760 --> 49:14.320]  Navy SEAL, best-selling author, counterterrorism specialist to get into Iran, Venezuela, and
[49:14.320 --> 49:15.800]  so much more.
[49:15.800 --> 49:20.400]  Okay, obviously I've got like 50 clips that we'll never get to them all, but we're loaded
[49:20.400 --> 49:22.440]  for bear as always.
[49:22.440 --> 49:27.960]  We've got all the big abortion laws changing towards a pro-life stance, and what the left's
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.520]  insane frenzied response to that is going to be.
[49:31.520 --> 49:35.720]  We've got massive Islamic takeover news and censorship against those that even criticize
[49:35.720 --> 49:41.480]  it in any way, but I'm asking first-time callers, what do you think of those four pillars?
[49:41.480 --> 49:45.040]  What do you think of my statement, that if Trump doesn't take dramatic action on those,
[49:45.040 --> 49:46.040]  he will lose in 2020?
[49:46.040 --> 49:51.360]  I mean, the big one is not letting us have free speech over modern telecommunications
[49:51.360 --> 49:52.720]  and calling it private company.
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.200]  Well, AT&T's private, they're going to break in on your phone calls, you say the wrong
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.920]  thing and I'll let you talk, we're actually talking about that now, that's how high-tech
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.240]  computers are, that's how they can surveil and record everything.
[50:04.240 --> 50:07.960]  Just 20 years ago I'd say they can surveil and record everything in live time, and the
[50:07.960 --> 50:10.840]  future, they'll stop what you can type in live time.
[50:10.840 --> 50:15.680]  Now Microsoft announced their new Microsoft Word, won't let you type certain words, and
[50:15.680 --> 50:17.960]  it's surveilling you in live time.
[50:17.960 --> 50:27.720]  It's all happening, it's all here, we're in 2019, we are in the future.
[50:27.720 --> 50:36.440]  The future is now, the tyrants are trying to steal control of the future.
[50:36.440 --> 50:37.920]  What are we going to do?
[50:37.920 --> 50:42.680]  All right, your calls are coming up right when we start the next hour.
[50:42.680 --> 50:48.160]  Now let me hit this, the good news is, Trump is saying I don't want to have a military
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.680]  strike on Iran, but they better stop harassing our ships and boats and provocations, which
[50:53.680 --> 50:56.920]  they have been involved, and now Trump has made the Federal Reserve, private Federal
[50:56.920 --> 50:59.080]  Reserve back off on raising interest rates.
[50:59.080 --> 51:02.600]  He's trying to secure the border, at least some, but he's going to declare the proper
[51:02.600 --> 51:06.800]  national emergency, put the regular military on there, ignore the courts, it's a constitutional
[51:06.800 --> 51:12.320]  crisis, we're in a crisis, the President has control of the border, that's the executive's
[51:12.320 --> 51:19.680]  purview, it's the President's jurisdiction, first and foremost, is defending the Republic
[51:19.680 --> 51:24.400]  from enemies far and domestic, securing the borders.
[51:24.400 --> 51:30.680]  That's what the executive does, the Congress, a lot of money controls the purse, they've
[51:30.680 --> 51:33.840]  given that to the private Federal Reserve.
[51:33.840 --> 51:43.000]  So it's unprecedented what's happening, and he's trying to obviously stand up to censorship.
[51:43.000 --> 51:47.280]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories, and on Salazar wrote
[51:47.280 --> 51:53.920]  about this last night, it rolled off the front page of newswars.com and infowars.com, but
[51:53.920 --> 52:00.960]  I'm going to ask the crew to repost it to the top of newswars.com and infowars.com,
[52:00.960 --> 52:05.480]  and everybody tweet the newswars version, they try to block you on Twitter and everywhere
[52:05.480 --> 52:11.000]  else if you tweet infowars, but the leftist tards are so stupid that they still haven't
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.920]  figured out newswars, that's a great way to get that out.
[52:13.920 --> 52:19.040]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share stories, Trump administration builds
[52:19.040 --> 52:25.960]  dossier of social media bias ahead of 2020 elections, and believe me, he's got his people
[52:25.960 --> 52:35.320]  on it, I know actually a fella who is involved, I wouldn't say quarterbacking it, but like
[52:35.320 --> 52:42.320]  a running back, a starting running back in this, and I'll just leave it at that, but
[52:42.320 --> 52:43.320]  that's exciting.
[52:43.320 --> 52:51.440]  And it's not a pat on the head too, when we get these calls, and don't so much get
[52:51.440 --> 52:55.160]  the calls from Trump anymore, which is fine, it's novel, I don't even care, I got told
[52:55.160 --> 52:58.720]  Trump, hey you don't need to call and pat me on the head, I just want you to take action,
[52:58.720 --> 53:06.440]  but then I just get calls from folks in the administration or in US intelligence, and
[53:06.440 --> 53:09.720]  none of this is a secret, all my phones are listened to, so the establishment knows this
[53:09.720 --> 53:13.960]  so it pisses them off so bad, and then I get asked or Rob do gets asked, we just get calls
[53:13.960 --> 53:18.720]  and what do you think the best thing is for the president to do on this, send us a report
[53:18.720 --> 53:22.960]  on that, send us a bunch of articles, and then we send it and then it goes into a file
[53:22.960 --> 53:26.920]  and then there's reports and we're just gathering intelligence on the globalist, and then now
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.320]  the president's just reaching out to you, just the same way and saying you're human
[53:30.320 --> 53:33.480]  intelligence on the ground, you know what happened to you, you have the screenshot they
[53:33.480 --> 53:38.800]  sent you, you have how they banned you on Twitter or Facebook, you have what they banned, send
[53:38.800 --> 53:47.760]  it all to us, just like Mark Dice got banned on Facebook for a Scooby-Doo meme, like type
[53:47.760 --> 53:51.960]  in Mark Dice's Scooby-Doo meme please, so just a small Scooby-Doo meme, you can click
[53:51.960 --> 53:57.440]  images everywhere, and you know the old Scooby-Doo, every episode of Scooby-Doo you grew up learning,
[53:57.440 --> 54:04.160]  there isn't really a monster, there isn't really a Gorgon, a zombie, a vampire, a werewolf,
[54:04.160 --> 54:15.520]  a Chewbacabra, a Bigfoot, there's somebody who wants to run everybody out of the town
[54:15.520 --> 54:21.680]  so they get the ski resort to have a mine or whatever, everybody knows about false flags,
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.720]  and they said that was hateful, and so Instagram blocked it, which is Facebook, and then he
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.120]  got suspended for a few weeks, that'll teach you, because you know at the end of each episode
[54:31.120 --> 54:38.320]  they pull the mask off, the monster, and oh it's really, oh it's really, now let's see
[54:38.320 --> 54:44.640]  who's really behind the protest, Gasp, old man Soros, let's see if you try to do that,
[54:44.640 --> 54:51.440]  oh Jesse Smollett staged it, well, well, well, well, well, you're not allowed to do that,
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.640]  and so that's just been delivered to the president, it's all being delivered, and then you're
[54:56.640 --> 55:00.320]  going to see TV ads and radio ads and press conferences about it, and then you're going
[55:00.320 --> 55:07.360]  to see moving against the Democrats and Big Tech admittedly trying to steal 2020 and lying
[55:07.360 --> 55:15.440]  to Congress about it, so good job President Trump, and good job audience who are activists,
[55:15.440 --> 55:23.200]  men and women in the arena for taking action, I salute you, I commend you, you're really
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.800]  doing it, keep it up on the campaign trail, keep it up on the streets, keep it up on c-span
[55:28.800 --> 55:35.200]  and talk radio and the internet and don't stop, I got a bunch of examples of censorship
[55:35.200 --> 55:40.160]  we're going to get to, but again, Tom Papert's going to pop in bottom of the next hour, radio
[55:40.160 --> 55:45.600]  host heads up one of the biggest Trump fan pages on Facebook, millions of followers,
[55:45.600 --> 55:51.840]  Tom Papert dared show the okay symbol, by the way I've not been looking for the okay
[55:51.840 --> 55:57.280]  symbol but I like riding Dangerfield and just old Jimmy Carson, Johnny Carson, all that
[55:57.280 --> 56:03.920]  stuff, so I for fun will actually punch up on the television old Johnny Carson, and without
[56:03.920 --> 56:10.160]  looking man, it's like Johnny Carson doing the okay sign and it's Rodney Dangerfield
[56:10.160 --> 56:16.400]  doing the okay sign, it's just crazy that they're attacking stuff in the international
[56:16.400 --> 56:23.440]  sign language symbol now of A-OK or it's great, it just makes my head spin at a certain point
[56:23.440 --> 56:29.360]  that we let these thought police do this and this is just crazy, absolutely insane,
[56:31.520 --> 56:37.520]  are we going to break, please don't forget, we just flashed it, please don't forget ladies and
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.520]  gentlemen, we're not here if you don't support us and I'm not bitching, I'm saying thank you,
[56:41.520 --> 56:47.120]  but you need ultra 12, double strong when secret 12, the best medical bottleman, vitamin B12 out
[56:47.120 --> 56:50.960]  there, the very same medical bottleman, I just reformulated it and signed a longer term deal
[56:50.960 --> 56:54.960]  and got a better deal, so I said I'm going to give you double the strength, the strongest
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.040]  out there that we know of in existence at 50% off out of the gates, but that special is going to
[56:59.040 --> 57:03.040]  happen in a week or so, the big special we've been running for the last week and a half,
[57:03.040 --> 57:06.320]  two weeks has got to end in the next few days because we're running out of survival shield,
[57:06.320 --> 57:10.400]  deep earth crystal X2, I thought it'd be our last run, we were able to get more,
[57:10.400 --> 57:16.400]  able to sign a longer contract, got a better deal and now X3 of the tri iodine, which is amazing,
[57:16.400 --> 57:22.000]  three types together with the deep earth crystal, that is free bottle of that with your bottle of
[57:22.000 --> 57:29.600]  X2, X2 25% off, free bottle of survival shield X3, never had a deal that good, find out why iodine
[57:29.600 --> 57:36.960]  is so amazing, but only the pure good iodine, infowarslife.com or triple 82533139, just peruse
[57:36.960 --> 57:41.920]  the site, check out infowarsstore.com and support the Second American Revolution, whatever you do,
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.280]  spread the word about those local AM and FM stations, only you can circumvent the census, and by the way, you are.
[57:48.960 --> 57:54.880]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are control
[57:54.880 --> 57:59.760]  freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions
[57:59.760 --> 58:04.800]  gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them hard in
[58:04.800 --> 58:09.120]  cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest
[58:09.120 --> 58:14.640]  places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[58:14.640 --> 58:20.240]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for infowarslife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why
[58:20.240 --> 58:25.280]  we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality Methylcobalamin
[58:25.280 --> 58:32.400]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.800]  highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing,
[58:36.800 --> 58:42.000]  experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution
[58:42.000 --> 59:07.520]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[59:07.520 --> 59:13.520]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[59:13.520 --> 59:18.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[59:18.960 --> 59:24.960]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[59:24.960 --> 59:30.720]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective. It is
[59:30.720 --> 59:35.920]  not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[59:35.920 --> 59:41.120]  activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[59:41.120 --> 59:47.280]  in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a
[59:47.280 --> 01:00:09.920]  pack of our pollen block chewable tablets. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:19.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:01:00.080]  Guess who's a white supremacist now? Stephen Fry. Why? He did the okay hand sign. But Stephen
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:07.920]  Fry is a lifelong liberal, atheist, environmentalist, labor-supporting, LGBT activist. But that whole
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.960]  thing was a contrivance of a bunch of nihilistic, autistic, 4 chance burglar trolls in a hysterical
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.120]  mainstream media that took them seriously by legitimizing their autism in return for
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.800]  rage bait revenue clicks. Doesn't matter, he did this. Guess who's a new face of the far right?
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:28.320]  This 14-year-old girl on YouTube says who? Buzzfeed. Must be true then. The writer of the
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.720]  hit piece on the 14-year-old girl, Buzzfeed's Joe Bernstein says,
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.680]  there are many more people who simply want to preserve the ability to be bigoted on private platforms.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:42.640]  But wait, isn't he the same guy who literally said, kill a straight white man on your way
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:48.400]  to work tomorrow? It doesn't matter. It's life when you work at Buzzfeed. According to Buzzfeed,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:53.920]  this 14-year-old girl's edgy videos are among the most shocking things ever and represent
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:59.840]  a moral crisis. But celebrating an 11-year-old drag queen kid and encouraging people to stick
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:08.240]  dollar bills in his panties, that's wholesome. They're here again. So a teenage girl is radicalizing
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.680]  young people and driving them towards political violence while major left-wing newspapers openly
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.320]  incite political violence. It's okay when we do it. Oh, but it's just a milkshake. Yeah, if Owen
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.800]  Jones and Anna Subri were getting doused with milkshakes, you'd all be wetting the bed like it was
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:32.960]  the return of the Third Reich. Never stop punching Nazis. Never stop lifting weights. Seems pretty
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:40.560]  low energy. Unlike Turboforce, the ultimate energy boost without the come down. Link in description.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:46.000]  Microsoft is set to release a new version of Word that uses artificial intelligence to make
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.280]  your writing politically correct. You know how annoying it is when the iPhone corrects f***ing
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.720]  to ducking every time you try and type it out. Imagine that for an entire essay. Rumour has
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:01.280]  it that every new purchase of Word will come with a voucher for a year's supply of Starbucks
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:07.600]  soylotes. Still seems like a waste of money. Unlike my subscribe star. Link in description.
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.880]  Western Motherhood in 2019. Taking a break from your own four-year-old daughter to spend more
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:19.360]  time in strip clubs. Western masculinity in 2019. Throwing thousands of beta books at ethos
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:26.480]  while you slip into a slow motion diabetic coma. God, life is f***ed. Isis extremists are using
[01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:32.000]  Instagram to promote G-Had. Still, at least my dangerous selfies have been deleted forever.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.080]  Paul Joseph Watson. Censorship. A weapon of tyrants used to oppress population since the
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:45.600]  dawn of history. Widely recognised as inherently evil ever since. And till about 2018 when Western
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.520]  leftists in Silicon Valley started using it to their advantage. And it suddenly became virtuous.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.160]  What a coincidence. Simply because they labelled everyone on the receiving end a Nazi. In 1943
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.120]  the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:10.960]  States. It read, when certain obstructionists become too irritating label them after suitable
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:18.320]  build-ups as fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic. And use the prestige of anti-fascist and
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.880]  tolerance organizations to discredit them. In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:31.200]  us with those names which already have a bad smell. The association will, after enough repetition,
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:36.960]  become fact. We handed a hysterical cult that demands total obedience and punishes those who
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:42.800]  resist. With deep platforming, public shaming, violence and arrest. The power to run society.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.600]  Whoops. It's been really shocking. Imagine a cashless society where your grocery purchase
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.480]  gets declined because some pencil neck in Silicon Valley got offended by your tweets.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.040]  You just imagined our collective future. We'll be back.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:04.320]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling, Mike. You are the man, Alex. I'm
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.560]  so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan. Ever since I've been listening,
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.760]  I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the bone broth. The bone broth.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.920]  The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:23.200]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk. It tastes like
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:29.840]  oval team. It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. Like good. I feel great since I've
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:36.240]  been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste. I've used the super
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.800]  male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well. Brother,
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.480]  you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you. But yes,
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:48.480]  this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:53.200]  the true bone broth. It is next level. It really is good. So thank you. I feel great
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:06:03.040]  since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:26.880]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.520]  Oh, they thought they'd shut us down a long time ago. They forgot about all those hundreds
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:46.080]  of radio stations. They even FM. Some of them 50,000 watt AMs. 100,000 watt FMs.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:53.920]  100,000 watt shortwave. Former Voice of America transmitters. Blast it now.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:04.480]  Oh, that's why we got our fingers in everything. Will you smoke signals if we need you to reach
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:18.880]  people? It's your source. 50,000. Unstoppable watch. All right, let's stop there.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.120]  By the way, Clutcher listeners, they've been on the show before,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  and then they got leftist attacks once Obama got in. We're a little bit ashamed of it. But I
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.240]  think I inspired that song too. A show I was doing about Fort Detrick and
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.640]  bio weapons and other things, but it doesn't matter. Of course, Bellamy admits is his big song.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.920]  Who really launched him was off this show, but then he got intimidated by all the threats too.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:51.360]  But see, that doesn't matter. See, we don't follow the rock stars. They follow us.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.560]  And then there's folks like the founder of Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan,
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:06.080]  who's not a coward and who's proud of Info Wars and others inspiring his last five albums.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:13.600]  You see, that's the real cultural power of Info Wars and what we've done and it's seen everywhere.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.000]  Remember just two and a half years ago, it seems like a thousand years ago?
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:27.200]  Chris Carter relaunched X Files and he had an Alex Jones character and he said,
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.080]  I think Alex Jones is good in the New York Times. He said, I don't think Alex Jones is a racist.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:37.760]  I think Alex Jones wants to reboot America and is a good guy. And it was stuff like that.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:43.520]  It made the establishment when Trump won go into a conniption fit.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.800]  And they said, we're going to get this guy off the air and we're going to shut him down.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:56.080]  And we're going to finance this homeland character for a hit show on cable that's Alex Jones,
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:01.600]  who we say is Alex Jones, who goes out and commits all these crimes and all this fake news
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:09.120]  and does all these bad things. And then that character, when he gets sued or the police
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.240]  command from him, he runs and hides in homeland. Well, see, I'm not that character from homeland.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:19.840]  So we're not running and hiding. We're in the halls of Congress getting in Sundar Pachai that
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.160]  had a Google's face and calling him a criminal liar and saying he should be indicted for working
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:29.040]  with the chai comms and espionage. And now they're having closed door intelligence hearings
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:38.800]  at the Senate discussing just that. Now, did I do that? No. I called the emperor's new closeout.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:46.560]  I said, no, two plus two equals four. But more importantly, our audience
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.560]  of hardcore focused individuals that love freedom and understand how much trouble we're in
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.720]  have spread the word and have not been intimidated. And that's really the amazing time
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:06.880]  we're living in right now. So I want to go to your phone calls right now throughout the balance
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:12.160]  of the transmission today, even when our guest room will be taking your calls. And I want to ask you,
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:18.800]  where do you see the world right now? Are the globalist winning or are we losing?
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.520]  How could Trump lose in 2020? They're trying to say, oh, he's way ahead in the polls. Oh,
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:29.920]  you know, there's nobody really challenging him. Oh, they want us to feel complacent. They want
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.800]  us to feel like we've already won when they're going to bring in massive censorship. It's already
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.200]  happening. Election fraud. They're trying to start wars. They're trying to kill the economy. They're
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.440]  trying to break our borders right now. We're in crisis. So don't think as Trump's up there
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.640]  projecting confidence that we're out of the woods, we're far from it. I want Trump to project
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:52.800]  confidence for the people, but to have the confidence to win the actual fight with the
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:11:02.800]  globalist. That's what this comes down to. Now, we're going to take your phone calls.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.240]  Do you agree with me that he's got to do those four things or he's going to lose?
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.640]  The Democrats are in a fever. They're always trying to steal stuff. They got caught last
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:16.640]  time. Trump barely won because of the fraud. He had a tsunami landslide. What do we do to stop that?
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.760]  Seriously, what are you going to do? I mean, I'm asking literally. I'm not condescending.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.800]  I'm not saying you haven't done enough. I'm saying you're the core people, but the system hates that
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:32.880]  actually care that they know we're beating them. I'm asking you because every one of you is a
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.760]  general. Every one of these are private. Every one of you is a mother and a father to this country
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:45.680]  and its son and its daughter. It's all symbiotic. We're in this together, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:52.800]  I was just four pillars. Which one of the pillars is the most important? Which pillars is Trump
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:58.240]  doing a good job on and which pillars is he not? Are there other pillars? Are there sub-pillars to
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:05.440]  the pillars? Trump's going to lose in 2020 unless he does those four things. I told you he was going
[01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:13.120]  to win. If fraud could be overcome with the landslide, we were so dead on about the illegal
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:18.800]  spying. We were so dead on about everything. Because the funny thing happens, if you're immersed in
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.680]  research, if you're immersed in all the best guest and immersed in all the calls, this is all you do,
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:30.720]  you kind of start figuring out how stuff works. So I'll ask you again, are we going to let them
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.200]  steal this election from us? Are we going to let them steal our victory to reboot the country back
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:40.480]  right at our moment of victory? Because I've got the debos, you know, the debos scum and the globalist.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:48.880]  Truth is, I didn't predict any of this. They're so arrogant. They go on television in Europe
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.360]  and in the US and say, we're not going to let populists have a voice. I'm very glad we're
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:58.720]  censoring. We're going to beat them. This is top globalist on US TV.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:10.720]  Debos elitist celebrates discussions being quickly erased from social networks.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:15.200]  So I ask you again, are we going to let them win? We're going to put up with this crap.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.360]  Let's talk to John in the great state of Texas. You're on the air, John. Thanks for calling.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.480]  Hi, Alex. Welcome. You know, the first thing, the first sign that Donald Trump needs to quit
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:33.440]  doing is quick giving to the Clint Smiths communist salute. I've seen him do it numerous times.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.320]  There was another website. They had a picture of him standing next to the victim here, China,
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:43.760]  giving the Clint Smiths communist salute. And I don't know if he's an outright communist or not,
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.440]  but people should, somebody should tell them to quit doing it because the earth's been.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.280]  Well, you know, I know folks get really upset about signals and symbols, but a symbol can mean
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.360]  anything. They were trolling because the US is breaking China's legs right now,
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.840]  devastating their operations. Huge announcements were made today against their 5G system.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.240]  And as you've understand, in China, that's not so much the symbol of revolutionary communism,
[01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:15.360]  but it is in the West. So Trump there with the communists doing that is, oh, I love your leader.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:21.440]  Oh, I'm your friend. He takes that energy away that they would have saying he's an enemy. So
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:24.560]  I'm, in my view, I think Trump is trolling them. What do you think?
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.680]  Well, I don't think he's a communist. I didn't think he could make a bad choice doing that.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:35.840]  But no, listen, I hear you. But I mean, people, I'm not saying you're wrong that I think it's bad
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.960]  visual etiquette to be doing the fist. You know, the fist just meant resistance for the
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.160]  communists took it. Why do we let the left take every symbol, rainbows, fists, rising suns,
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.080]  you know, everything's supposedly occultic. And I'm not saying you're wrong
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.760]  that the but I mean, you know, he wears an American flag at at Davos. He wears an American flag at
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.440]  EU meetings. Everybody else is wearing global government pens. I mean, he does a lot of good
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.960]  stuff. It's not about defending Trump. You called in about the four pillars, though. Did you want
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.560]  to comment on what Trump needs to do to win? It's kind of it's kind of do away with his censorship.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:13.840]  This is right out of the Soviet Union. That's the first threat. He needs to do away with the
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:18.400]  these meal kinds. They're trying to start a war with Iran. It's a war with Iran. It's going to
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.440]  double steep the country. How many trees of dollars in debt? How much debt button costs?
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.680]  It's got to mention all the damages stuff it'll do.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.440]  Now, I hear you, brother, I appreciate your call. I would take all that angry energy,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.280]  and I'm not condescending here. I'm saying call C span a few times a day during Washington Journal,
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.120]  calling to talk radio, go out with a bullhorn during a live event, take over like we do.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.240]  I mean, we're out there fighting. We're the men in the arena and you are too.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:51.680]  And I encourage you to call this show. I would just call shows outside of the choir or call

[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:22.480]  5 different types of caffeine.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.600]  That's turbo force, five different types of caffeine
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.800]  Those are not the crush
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800]  Five different types of caffeine
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.800]  That's turbo force, can't derive
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:35.040]  Five hundred, no, I'm gradual by the very bad
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.120]  I'm alone, burn, can't derive
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.520]  Five hundred, no, I'm gradual by the very bad
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.640]  That's turbo force
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.600]  Ah, okay, well, I'm throwing a lot of energy in my brain here
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:48.960]  And good right now, good right now, good right, good right, good right now
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.160]  We work out, next level, turbo force, turbo force
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.440]  We work out, next level, turbo force, turbo force
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.840]  And get the fish oil
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:01.520]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.520]  Is that I won't be there for my children someday
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.120]  That's why I need to make them strong now
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:06.880]  Now I can be there for my children
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.720]  Now I can make them strong
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.320]  Now I can instruct them
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.000]  Now I can teach them what I've learned
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.120]  But not once I'm gone
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.120]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:16.240]  But now they're using better
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.240]  Getting rid of what you said they were before
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:21.920]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.920]  Now that we have high tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:27.440]  But I have joined my will to the resistance
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.560]  I can't be destroyed now
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.880]  As long as I realize I've done right
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.480]  And the longer the people know the truth
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.840]  And you can't be destroyed either
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.840]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.360]  And go through the fire for it
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:41.520]  There is a magic that then takes place
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.200]  The transcend space and time
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.120]  When you commit, be a word of mouth
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.080]  Or to pray for us
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.680]  Or to spread our articles and videos
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:50.800]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing
[01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.200]  So please now commit to support InfoWars
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.440]  However you can and realize your provision
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:21.040]  To InfoWars is your own provision
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.720]  I'm just an average man
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:27.520]  The Christchurch call was not only something extremely moving
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.080]  But also extremely effective
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.880]  Because the key players in the social network
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.320]  Had decided to support
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:44.160]  It's something which has been discussed amongst the head of states
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:47.840]  The Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was there
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:52.000]  And has been making a very moving speech
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:59.360]  Regarding how the hatred and the speech of hate
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.240]  Are contaminating the social network
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.840]  And I believe that this landmark
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.840]  In how people will now operate
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:18.400]  And how some discussion will be quickly erased
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.720]  From the social network
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.080]  There was still some criticism
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.120]  That potentially the changes don't go far enough
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.400]  Because it still puts the onus
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.640]  On the social media companies to do more
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.080]  And one of the issues seemed to be
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.840]  The ability of these technology companies
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.880]  To remove negative content very quickly
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:36.320]  Almost immediately
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.000]  Do you think we're going to see that change
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.680]  Of behavior from technology companies
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.080]  That you have worked with a lot as an advertiser?
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.360]  I think that it's not only a question of technology
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.920]  It's also a question of willingness
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.840]  And there was a big debate regarding freedom of speech
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:03.840]  And can they remove things because of the freedom of speech
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.280]  Or should they have a kind of censorship
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.040]  And at the end of the day
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.760]  There is a balance which has been made
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.120]  And I think that where we are today is a good step
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.120]  I would say that it's the ultimate solution
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.600]  And this is the best thing that we can do
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.560]  But I think it's a step in the right direction
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.840]  Facebook has been extremely strong on their willingness to help
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.040]  It's the same with Jack Dorsell who was there personally
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.840]  And we feel that there is a consciousness
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.960]  Of the leaders of the social network
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.120]  That these can harm
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:51.040]  And this can be a terrible thing for society
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.360]  So they are conscious of the need
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:54.560]  And they have taken steps
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.520]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.200]  Davos Alidas celebrate
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.800]  Discussions being quickly erased from social networks
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.360]  Close quote
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.320]  Anything disagreeing with world government
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.760]  Sexualizing your children
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.200]  Not letting radical Islam in
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.920]  They're now saying if you criticize Islam in any way
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.120]  You're just banned everywhere
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.200]  They're arresting people in Europe
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.720]  While they let the Islamists run around
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.320]  Burning and killing and stealing and raping
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.160]  Absolutely criminal
[01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:21.360]  And then they go before Congress and say
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.640]  We're not censoring anybody
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:26.320]  Meanwhile they've got this guy on CNBC
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.240]  Throwing it in your face
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.080]  What does Trump need to do?
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.320]  Well antitrust
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:34.960]  Go after them for their criminal selling of data
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.720]  They're lying to Congress
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.080]  This argument that oh they're a private company
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:41.280]  You can't do anything
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.520]  The EU, the Chai comms are already creating regulations
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.040]  That then override our laws of free speech
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.400]  We have to say no
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.920]  Just like Huawei openly caught spying all over the world
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.280]  Whenever they put 5G in
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.360]  Backdoors Chinese government run
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.360]  And Trump says no
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.520]  Now you can't even sell your equipment in the US
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:05.440]  He signed that order last night
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.120]  You can do the same damn thing to Facebook
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.800]  And Twitter and Google and all these arrogant people
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.080]  They're not so arrogant now though
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.120]  They figure out what's happening
[01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.920]  Let's go to Mike in Illinois
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.960]  Mike, I call the four pillars of what Trump must do
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.960]  To not have the election stolen
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.160]  And our nationalist movement
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.280]  Our populist movement killed in 2020
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:32.000]  That's only a year out now from the heart of the race
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.760]  I've listed those for new listeners, I'll do it again
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.680]  Defend free speech
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:37.680]  Stop the censorship for election integrity
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.800]  Election fraud
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.240]  Deal with that, that's one
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.760]  Stop trying to plunge the economy
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.520]  By the Federal Reserve
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.200]  Don't let them start new big giant wars
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.160]  And defend the border
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.000]  If the president doesn't do those things
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.760]  He will lose, they will steal the election
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.240]  What do you think?
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.920]  Mr. Jones, it's an honor to talk to you
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.360]  Welcome
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.840]  I think you're right on with the four pillars
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.280]  I saw something very interesting the other day
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:04.480]  I don't know if people realize how controlled this man is
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:08.000]  It was a YouTube video of an interview
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.280]  Between Chris Plant and President Trump
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.320]  And if you look in the background
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.560]  The whole interviewer people waving him off
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:17.680]  Trying to stop the interview
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.600]  Well, I'm not omnipresent
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.440]  So I don't know about Trump
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:24.720]  Was being interviewed by somebody
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.000]  And people are waving him off
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.960]  What does that mean?
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:27.840]  By Chris Plant
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.520]  And he's another radio personality
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.680]  And everybody in the background
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.880]  Kept waving him off
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.480]  Because they were talking like you and I
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.440]  Are talking right now
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.120]  So I really think he's very isolated
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.840]  And doesn't know a lot that's going on
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.120]  Sure, you're saying, I don't know what you're speaking
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:49.760]  You're saying the president goes over to talk to some radio host
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.000]  And there's all these people, all these handlers
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.920]  Trying to keep him from talking to him
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.040]  Absolutely, and Chris Plant is very conservative
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.040]  So I'm sure they didn't disappear
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.480]  Sir, there's no speculation here
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:09.200]  When they put a leadership in there
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.440]  And his new chief of staff last year
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.320]  They said the main mission was keeping them
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:17.680]  From getting info wars information
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.920]  So that's what John Kelly said his main mission was
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:24.480]  To keep Trump from being able to surf the internet
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.600]  Or make phone calls
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.800]  And so you're absolutely right
[01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:30.240]  In fact, can we fade up the Facebook audio and video for TV viewers
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.400]  Because we found what you're talking about
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.120]  Where the president sees somebody, comes over and talks to him
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.680]  And then the establishment doesn't like it
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.600]  And so they're trying to wave him off
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.080]  I appreciate it very much
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.800]  And I know that you're talking about taxes today
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.920]  I've just been speaking to some of your staff
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.680]  Some of your people about all of that
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:54.640]  Now what's the one thing that you think that is
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.880]  That Americans, people in your butters, need to know about tax reform
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.040]  Well, with the highest tax nation
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.800]  And a lot of this is the president's busy
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.680]  He's got to go places
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.360]  People are going to wave him off and wave him over
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.120]  But regardless, people always look for something like a video
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:10.880]  They see for the proof of what's happening
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.080]  But you can have total admissions and just no one even cares
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.040]  If it's like all over the news, they try to handle him
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.280]  All over the news, they try to control what info he gets
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.640]  He'll try to sign executive orders
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.280]  They'll slip him under things to make sure they don't go out
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.240]  That there's total rebellion in the government against Trump
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.160]  There's massive mutiny going on
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.800]  There's whole agencies not doing what the president says
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.160]  When it's legal and lawful
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:35.760]  You've got judicial tyranny and activism going on
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.520]  Where he does executive orders and things
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.360]  About banning people from seven countries
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.640]  That's in the Constitution
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.240]  And then it takes him a year to finally have
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.880]  The Supreme Court unanimously rule that he has that power
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.800]  So yes, you're absolutely right, Mike
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.920]  That's going on
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.280]  Yeah, I have one more habit to touch with you
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.840]  It's a Ted Nugent story
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.120]  I live in McHenry County
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.640]  We're 35 miles west of Thunderdome
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.760]  Which I call Chicago
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.560]  And it was announced a few months ago
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.600]  That Ted Nugent will be playing at our county service summer
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.920]  And of course, all the usual suspects were outraged
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.280]  They want to have, uh, they want to cancel him
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:15.760]  They want to have demonstrations
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.800]  And guess what happened?
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.400]  All-time record presale of tickets
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.480]  Well, I think you hit the key here
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:24.080]  And I keep meaning to say this every hour
[01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:24.720]  I should say it
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.280]  When you don't give in to censors and double down
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:27.920]  They fail
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:28.800]  They're bullies
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.400]  The left has no viewers, no listeners
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.440]  No one likes them
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.720]  Except for mentally ill
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.320]  You know, folks that have five college degrees
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.880]  And huge debt and can't get a job as you know
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.640]  So they want a communist overthrow
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.200]  Because they've got a degree in communist management
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.720]  Of American slaves
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.600]  Seriously
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.720]  So yes, absolutely
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.760]  Double down
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.120]  Don't give in to the intimidation
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.480]  Override their censorship
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.520]  Say no, no, no

[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:40.800]  And it just so happens
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.760]  It'd already been labeled with the other
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.800]  We decided to change the name

[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.360]  And the next Gavin McInnis is going to join us
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.160]  As well in fact I forgot this guys
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.360]  Before I forget for next hour
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:56.000]  There's an actual email that we got from a national newspaper
[01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:59.440]  Of what Facebook actually sent out to the press
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.720]  When we were banned two weeks ago now today
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.320]  That actually says because we had Gavin McInnis
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:08.240]  A major hate leader on
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.400]  That was another reason we were being permanently banned
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:13.840]  Now remember Obama hangs out with Lewis Farrakhan
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.240]  So does Stevie Wonder and everybody else
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.680]  And I say that's their free speech fine
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.120]  But Farrakhan's banned as well
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.680]  To imagine these degrees of separation
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:26.720]  So we have that email
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.760]  I had the crew do an article on it last week
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:31.600]  Or somebody can get in the email
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.120]  And get me that letter again
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:36.320]  We have about 40 minutes till I get him on
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.000]  But I'll need that by then
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:38.320]  Thank you
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:40.320]  Now continuing here
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:45.040]  Tom Pappert is a talk show host in his own right
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.440]  And he manages a great TV station
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.080]  We're on KCTU there in Wichita, Kansas
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.640]  Facebook slaps Trump supporter with 30-day ban
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.960]  For doing okay hand sign
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:00.560]  Now again they're saying they're not censoring anybody
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.360]  Who's conservative
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.160]  No just if you do an okay sign
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.600]  That everyone on earth
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.400]  From Rodney Dangerfield to
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:12.240]  Eddie Murphy has done
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.520]  It's in the international hand sign symbol
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.160]  Meaning okay
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.600]  If you're diving
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.080]  And they ask you if you have enough air
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.040]  Or everything's okay
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.040]  As you kind of go along the bottom
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.160]  They say are you okay
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.240]  Now we all know that the system knows it's not racist
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:29.920]  They just want to be able to take anything
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.440]  And say you can't say mother and father
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:32.000]  That's hateful
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.920]  Or well you misgendered me
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.880]  I'm really too gendered
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.680]  You could never know
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.800]  It's all about it's impossible for you to serve me
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.920]  And taking the mental illness of the universities
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.000]  And expanding it out across the world
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:46.640]  But Tom has been suspended
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.800]  As an evil thought criminal
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.000]  Paul Joseph Lawson wrote about it
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.760]  He also writes for bigleaguepolitics.com
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:54.400]  Tom does Facebook slaps Trump supporter
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.600]  With 30-day ban
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.840]  For doing okay hand sign
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.080]  And of course the providence of this was
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.680]  4chan loves to troll Hillary
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:05.600]  So three years ago right before the campaign ended
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.560]  She lost, she said this frog they like
[01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:11.360]  This isn't like supremacist leaders
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.120]  She made it the white supremacist leader
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.680]  And then 4chan said yes
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.880]  And when Trump does this
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.800]  The okay sign which he does all the time for 40 years
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:24.000]  I've been saying hey everything's great
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:24.640]  Everything's wonderful
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.600]  Oh you'll love our golf course
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.240]  It's really good
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.720]  Like a chef says oh you're gonna love the food
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:30.640]  They bought it
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.520]  And so now you've got Cubs fans doing it
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.880]  Which means support of Trump
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.080]  You will that's blurred out
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:36.880]  Lifetime bans
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.200]  This is a contrived hysteria
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.680]  And it's incredibly dangerous
[01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:45.920]  That it's gotten to this point
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:48.560]  But again these people mean business
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.680]  Tom I wonder if you'll get banned from
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.200]  Banking
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.960]  I mean they're already saying ban all this from banking
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.520]  I mean maybe you'll be banned from any sporting event next
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.240]  I mean you you you made a hand signal
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:01.280]  You're in a lot of trouble Tom
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.000]  I know I guess I'm a Nazi
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.080]  I had no power in this decision
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:08.000]  But Facebook decided that I'm a Nazi
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.280]  And it's actually funny Alex
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.520]  You know you talk about the baseball stadium
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:15.360]  That picture it was a screenshot from a show I did last week
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:20.080]  Making fun of the absurdity of getting banned from Wrigley fields
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.600]  For doing the okay symbol
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.680]  And so I'm saying that if you do an okay symbol
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.440]  I guess you're an evil angry man
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.680]  And I make the funny face
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.680]  And somebody took a screenshot of it
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:30.640]  And sent it to me
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.480]  And they added the literal Nazi
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.000]  Because of course I'm a Nazi
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.440]  Because I do this now
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.040]  And so it was just a joke
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.040]  An absurd over the top joke
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.520]  And Facebook took it seriously
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.160]  And you're right
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.680]  It is this type of hysteria
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:45.520]  This type of oh we finally got him
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:46.480]  We got him for something
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.760]  He's a bad man
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:49.600]  You know it really does make you wonder
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.160]  What's next
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.400]  And we've already had conservatives banned from banking
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.880]  And we've had conservatives banned from payment processors
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.480]  I know you're no stranger to this
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:59.280]  You've had probably a dozen payment processors
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.240]  Block you
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.040]  But you know Alex
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:03.040]  I don't see you doing this very often
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.880]  So I guess maybe it's unwarranted
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.480]  Maybe you're not a bad guy after all
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.760]  Maybe frog man good
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.560]  I mean you heard my breakdown of this
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.440]  Of why they're doing it
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:15.280]  They're just appropriating every symbol
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:17.120]  Every system saying it's evil
[01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.080]  So that to communicate
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.560]  You've got to go through these new high priests of communication
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:22.480]  And that's what the EU and others even admit
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.960]  They want prior restraint on memes
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:26.000]  On all communications
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.920]  This is incredibly cult-like
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.320]  It really is
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.680]  And that's really what they want to do
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.760]  They want to control how we talk to each other
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.800]  How we think in our day-to-day life
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.320]  The words that go into our brain
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.120]  I will hear people say a word that is banned on Facebook
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.480]  And it's not a terrible word
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.000]  It's not a terrible slur
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.600]  It could be like the T-word
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:47.360]  And I don't mean transmission
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.240]  Something close though
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:51.040]  And I hear someone say that in my day-to-day
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.160]  And my heart skips a beat
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.040]  Like oh my goodness
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:54.240]  Something bad's gonna happen
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:57.120]  Like I expect Facebook's thugs to come out of the woodwork
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:58.320]  To hold this guy away
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:01.360]  The trannies called themselves trannies
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:04.800]  So then if you say that though, you're bad
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.680]  It's all selective
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:06.960]  It's a new royalty
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:08.240]  It's a total tyranny
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.840]  And it's just absolutely out of control
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.520]  Absolutely
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.040]  This type of language policing
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.840]  And if they can get us to go along with their rules
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.360]  You know, I did a whole show last night
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:19.680]  I was on somebody else came over to my studio
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.440]  So I could use their Facebook account
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.200]  Because I follow all the rules
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:24.320]  And so I did a show last night
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.920]  And I said, you know, you're not gonna stop me
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.760]  You're not gonna stop me from making jokes
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.040]  I'm not going to comply
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.320]  With your insane globalist thought policing
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.680]  Because that's how they win
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:36.320]  If they can make you say that big brother is good
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.280]  That's how they win
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.600]  That's how they finally won in 1984
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.240]  Winston submitted after torture
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.840]  No, I'm not going to submit
[01:39:43.840 --> 01:39:45.680]  And that's what I think is so powerful about
[01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.880]  Broadcasts like this one
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.080]  That you will not submit
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.560]  You would rather be banned into oblivion
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.160]  Go down the memory hole
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:54.480]  Then play along with their little rules
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.440]  And stop saying the T-word, tranny
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.880]  And notice, Tom, they're always adding new words
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.160]  And new things we can't use
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.440]  There's never enough
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.640]  That's the whole point of this
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.880]  Once you surrender to thought police
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.080]  The sky's the limit
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.760]  And they admit they're doing this
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.520]  What do you make of the president
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.080]  Coming on and saying and setting up a site
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.320]  At the White House where you can report
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.680]  All the censorship you're going through
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:19.200]  I think that's a big step in the right direction
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:22.000]  But, you know, the election is barreling towards us
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  I think it needs to take serious action now
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.320]  Well, I agree with you completely
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.720]  I think that this is a good, important step
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:30.800]  I hope that the president will take it seriously
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.120]  I hope that the administration will take it seriously
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.800]  But just look at how many people are gone
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.080]  How many people who were out there in the trenches
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.400]  Circumventing the mainstream media's narrative
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.240]  Back in 2016 that are already gone
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.280]  You, Gavin McInnes, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.000]  Laura Loomer, the names just stretch
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.440]  As far as you can see
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:52.320]  And so these are the president's top supporters
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:53.120]  Being taken down
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.400]  So I hope that he will do something
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.600]  I hope he's not going to wait and examine and monitor
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:59.840]  I appreciate that he is posting about this
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:02.640]  And that he is actively making it a part of his campaign speeches
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.640]  When he goes out to do his rallies
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.240]  But we need some real action
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:08.240]  Because at this point, the big tech companies
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.920]  They think that the Trump administration
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.160]  I just guessed this, I have no insider knowledge
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.320]  But they seem to think that the Trump administration
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.840]  Is weak and they're in effect
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:17.120]  Oh, let's expand on that
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.600]  David from the big neocon at Atlantic Monthly
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:21.040]  Said two weeks ago
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:24.080]  Don't worry, President Trump's weak
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.520]  He's not going to take action
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.200]  He's all talk, shut him down
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.520]  Now he changed the headline later
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.040]  Because people are like, well, that might actually
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.080]  Give him a take action
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.840]  But this is just insane
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.680]  You can't say Alex Jones
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.320]  You can't say M4 Wars unless it's in a negative light
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.240]  You can't show an okay sign
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.560]  What a bunch of sick freaks on the left
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.480]  Saying we're white supremacists
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.920]  Applying it to that
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.600]  And then stealing our free speech for you
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.440]  That is so sick
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:52.640]  While the left runs around foaming at the mouth
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.560]  Calling for everybody else to be censored
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:58.000]  Calling for censorship and calling for violence
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.760]  I can't tell you how many death threats
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.840]  I get in the Facebook page inbox
[01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.680]  Or on my own personal profile
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:04.880]  But that's totally fine
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.640]  I can't tell you how many groups there are
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.760]  Where people are calling for actual violence
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:10.880]  Against Trump supporters
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.720]  Actual discrimination against Trump supporters
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:14.240]  But all of that gets ignored
[01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:16.480]  Because they're in the right and we're in the wrong
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.720]  We are the enemy, we are the other
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.880]  Trump, they're the holy anointed
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.160]  They're the establishment
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.680]  They get to play God
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.920]  And you look at the useful idiots that have joined the system
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.760]  They're so pathetic
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.720]  Because the algorithms, the AI is already replacing them
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.360]  All the leftist publications from BuzzFeed to Salon
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:35.520]  Are going bankrupt, closing their doors
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.600]  Because their job is done
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.640]  They don't even get
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.160]  The left doesn't get
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:42.080]  Nationalist patriots being around
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.280]  Always would have given them a job
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.600]  They don't get like removing everybody
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.960]  Now you're obsolete
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.040]  But they don't care
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:49.760]  They don't care
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:53.360]  Because most of the leftist writers are mentally efficient
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:01.120]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.160]  They are technocrats
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.480]  They are control freaks in their own words
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.480]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.760]  And make your own decisions
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:10.240]  Gets to the way of their great destiny
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:11.760]  To merge with AI gods
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.680]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:14.880]  We're fighting them hard
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:16.240]  Right here in the third dimension
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:18.800]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.360]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.640]  Is our bodies
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:25.040]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.400]  For the ForrestLive.com
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.840]  I couldn't do it
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.200]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.400]  That was incredibly high quality
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.280]  Metalica Bottleman
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.600]  And double the strength of it
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.840]  In a new formula, Ultra 12
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.400]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.920]  Highest quality B12
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.760]  Over the counter that you're going to find anywhere
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:47.200]  It is amazing, experience pure Metalica Bottleman B12
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:50.000]  For yourself and fund the second American evolution
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.360]  Against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:54.560]  infowarslife.com
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.960]  Or AAA-253-3139
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.720]  They've not shut down our speech
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:02.240]  We're at infowars.com and newswars.com
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.240]  And we're defeating the leftist tyrants
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:06.000]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.080]  But almost all of them said we used to love you on air
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:11.760]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:13.120]  Are you coming back?
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:14.880]  We're at infowars.com
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.240]  We're at newswars.com
[01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.000]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:18.480]  Dot news
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.440]  We have our own videos
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.480]  We have our own articles
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:21.680]  They're trying to destroy us
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.520]  But thanks to you and others having us on
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.200]  InfoWars are still checking along
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.160]  So we're there folks
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.200]  Tomorrow's news

[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:31.280]  Man, woo!
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.440]  InfoWars.com
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:36.640]  Because that's much people out here
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.400]  I'm talking about infowars.com
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.120]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:41.520]  There you go
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:43.360]  We knew this censorship was coming forever
[01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.800]  We have our own video streams
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.920]  Our own audio streams
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.880]  And it's all free to air
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.080]  Anybody can use it
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.600]  Reupload and do whatever you want
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.080]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:52.960]  That's where they find it
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.800]  You know, there's what things called websites
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:55.360]  Please go there

[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.920]  And it's not like we're selling stuff
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.360]  You don't need, you don't want
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.760]  The air in the average American home
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.680]  Is filled with toxins
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:11.360]  That put it on par with a major city
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.760]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.880]  Our major cities
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:16.640]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.440]  So we have air filters at infowars.com
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.800]  The Alexa Pure Breeze
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.320]  Which is right now $50 off
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.280]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.320]  Iron Cluster Air Filter Technology
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.280]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:35.120]  We're basically selling these at cost
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.200]  Because there was a big overhaul
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.160]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:43.040]  For yourself, I've got two in my home
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.320]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.120]  With the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.760]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home

[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:17.520]  Created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:18.720]  The new platinum standard
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:21.200]  Of advanced multivitamin formulation

[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:33.120]  We've managed to make this powerhouse formula

[01:46:53.600 --> 01:47:23.440]  Available at infowarsstore.com
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:33.920]  All right, I'm going to go back to your phone calls
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:36.320]  Tom Pappert is about to go back to his great work
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.080]  At bigleafpolitics.com
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.840]  And managing that TV station he has
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:44.160]  But pulling back from this
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:48.480]  Well, you have the globalist overwhelming society
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.080]  Setting up an anti-human world government
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:54.320]  Flooding us with radical Islamists
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:55.680]  Sexualizing our children
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:01.600]  And then you've got these attempts to have their cake and eat it too
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:04.080]  And censor people and celebrate censorship
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.920]  And say they want to bankrupt people
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:07.520]  And say they want to silence us
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:10.720]  And just constant comments about go out and find a heterosexual
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.520]  And kill them
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.360]  Go out and find a white man and kill them
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.040]  I mean, this is just the ethos of the vicious spew
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:20.320]  And then if you do an okay sign, you're banned
[01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:25.360]  It's just shameful how criminal these people are
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.560]  And they're not going to win
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:30.160]  Because you can see the momentum building in Congress
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.920]  Building around the world to say no to this
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.480]  And I don't think they're going to get away with it, Tom
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.280]  I think that they've really pushed too far
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.200]  But it's going to be a lot easier for society
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:41.280]  If we just crack down on these individuals
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.840]  Because this whole right wing kind of fake libertarian cult
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.440]  Oh, they're private companies
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:51.040]  Oh, okay, so AT&T can break in on my phone line and say what I can say
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:51.840]  They can listen to me
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:54.560]  Because they are listening, but they know it's illegal
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.240]  They get in trouble, but Big Tech just does it
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.000]  And it's the same thing
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.440]  These people are a joke
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:00.880]  They're out of control
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.160]  And I think with what you see with Trump doing to the Chai comms right now
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.480]  What you see with Trump doing with these announcements to
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.160]  He is going to move forward against censorship
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.720]  I just can't believe they don't get that after 40, 50 years of Big Tech
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.880]  Having no oversight, it's coming
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:19.680]  Well, and they have this fantasy the Big Tech folks do
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.440]  That if they can just make the regulations, then they'll be fine
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:26.400]  And you see some of them are already saying, please regulate us
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.240]  It'll be great, just regulate us
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.560]  And we'll tell you what regulations to put in place
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:32.400]  Which to me says they're scared
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.080]  They realize that this is coming
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.080]  And they're hoping, praying that they get some good regulation
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:39.440]  Like the farm of people have
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:41.840]  Where it's going to cement their monopoly
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:45.120]  And I'm sure the GOPE, the establishment
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.720]  I'm sure they would love to give that to them
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.920]  Because they benefit
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.480]  Certain names that I won't denigrate anybody on your show
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:53.680]  But certain very popular conservatives benefit from Big Tech
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.080]  Because Big Tech knows that they're part of the Uniparty
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.240]  They might as well have a D next to their name
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.080]  They're just a token Republican
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:02.560]  And the people that benefit see nothing wrong with any of this
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.480]  They see it as removing the competition
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.840]  Getting rid of Alex Jones
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.240]  Getting rid of fun meme pages on the internet
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.400]  Getting rid of alternative and new media
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:12.960]  They see it as a boon to their business model
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.400]  They see it as the way they get more
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:15.280]  You just said it, the Well Street Journal
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.800]  Before I got banned last year said
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.720]  Once Jones is banned
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:19.760]  And no one stands up for him
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.880]  We're going to ban everybody
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.240]  The internet will be like Netflix
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.920]  We're going to be incredibly popular
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.040]  And profitable
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.160]  And that's what news corps they were splitting up was saying
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:31.200]  So exactly, we've got the neocons, the blueblods
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.960]  Wanting a monopoly of markets
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:34.560]  Saying damn the First Amendment
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:37.360]  Don't they get the left is going to slit their throats
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.400]  Once they get control
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.440]  We, I mean, they're crazy, the left is cancer
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.440]  It really is
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.200]  I think they think that they're part of it
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  You know, you've got these certain type of people
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:50.320]  Where they just want to be a part of the game
[01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.240]  They want to be a good little boy
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.680]  And get their pat on the head
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.840]  From the establishment, from the left
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.200]  From the insane people
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:58.480]  And they want to be part of the club
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:00.560]  They want it to be invited to the cocktail parties
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560]  They want to go to the donor meetings
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.080]  And they think that they're just safe
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:07.040]  And the fact is, once they can take all of us out
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:08.880]  All of a sudden, the more moderate
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:10.320]  So-called moderate voices
[01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.480]  That are actually just establishment voices
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.080]  They're going to be on the chopping block too
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:15.440]  I mean, the way this ends
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.720]  You're going to have Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.840]  And you're going to have Nancy Pelosi's Democratic Party
[01:51:21.840 --> 01:51:23.120]  And nothing else out there
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:26.880]  That will be all the realm of public discussion
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.160]  And let's expand on that
[01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.120]  Let's expand on that
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:32.640]  Max Kaiser was here about two and a half years ago
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.600]  After the election
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.200]  And we went to dinner and hung out and all this
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:39.360]  And he said, you can't tell this story on air
[01:51:39.360 --> 01:51:40.640]  But I'm going to tell you the story
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:43.360]  Then I saw him in D.C. three weeks ago at Trump Hotel
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:46.400]  And he just started telling the story on camera
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.000]  Because, you know, he's been really good friends
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.600]  With Alec Baldwin for 30 years
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.160]  You know, he knows the Soros sons
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.280]  He was a top broker
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.560]  He was at a very famous folks house for a huge party
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.160]  That a big screen television that was a story tall
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:04.480]  And there's all these top Democrats there
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:05.600]  And Alec Baldwin's there
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:08.320]  And when Trump won that night
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.160]  Baldwin flipped out on him
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.200]  They were all crying
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.400]  And said, I think you're a Russian agent
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.720]  And actually called the FBI on his friend of 30 years
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.760]  That they've been on, you know, vacations together
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:24.240]  You know, I mean, they're close, we're close friends
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:28.400]  Alec Baldwin won't even talk to Max Kaiser now
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.160]  Even though he's known him 30
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:37.040]  I mean, Max Kaiser was in like 1988 videos on nightline
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.400]  About the stock market, okay
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.480]  I mean, he vacations with the Soros's
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.360]  I'm going to leave it at that
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.640]  And literally Alec Baldwin
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.080]  Who's been in parties with Kaiser 30 plus years ago
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:50.560]  And knows him and again, they vacation together
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:55.200]  Will not talk to him and actually believes he's a Russian agent
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:56.800]  This is cuckoo land
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.520]  Now he's the enemy
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.560]  Now he's the other
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.280]  You know, when I was at a left-wing college campus
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.480]  They warned us against demonizing the other
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.600]  And making people who are just like you into the other
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:12.640]  And now that is exactly what the left, what the social media tech people
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.200]  What everybody on this massive globalist front is doing to us
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.760]  They see Alex Jones and they say, you're not a person
[01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:22.560]  They see some guy in his 20s doing the okay symbol
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.080]  And they say, you're not a person
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.000]  We can ban you, we can take you out of the banks
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  We can attack you, we can call the police on you
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.400]  We can turn on our friends of 30 years
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:33.120]  Because suddenly you're not a human being anymore
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.000]  You're the enemy
[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  I mean, that's exactly what they're doing to us
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.680]  And it's interesting that they think it's just censorship
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.040]  Some of these controlled people
[01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.880]  Some of the blue bloods, as you say
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.400]  Because they're going to be turned on eventually
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.520]  You know, we think they're wrong
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.040]  They want us dead
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.360]  Even the blue bloods, they've got their things where
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:55.200]  Well, I want a small government and I want this and I want that
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.840]  Well, to them, you're saying that you want Hitler in office
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.040]  That's what the Democrats hear when you challenge their narrative nowadays
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.680]  Exactly, because they've got two or three college degrees
[01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.960]  That are worthless, they're pissed
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.240]  They're supposed to be the ruling class
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:13.520]  This utopia that AOC and, you know, before her Bernie Sanders
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:16.240]  And of everything free, it's gonna get here
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.080]  It's Donald Trump and Tom Pappert and Max Kaiser
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.720]  And Alex Jones and Gavin McGinnis, they're the ones stopping it
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.280]  Tom, you're awesome, we love your great work
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:27.760]  All the great pleases, people can follow you
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.560]  You're blocked on Facebook now at God Emperor Trump official
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.680]  You're on Twitter for now at RealGETrump
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:35.040]  God bless you, we'll talk to you soon
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:37.120]  Thank you for having me on, Alex
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.160]  It's always a pleasure
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:38.640]  Thank you
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.640]  And I'm gonna try to run through some calls here
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.160]  And we'll take calls with Gavin McGinnis
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.720]  But I want to know specifically, what do you think Trump should do?
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.360]  Because the president is listening
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:48.880]  And they're trying to codify a plan right now
[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:51.040]  And they've gotten down to the working groups
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:54.960]  That are developing the battle plans
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.640]  For what Trump's gonna do
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.880]  And the system is so pissed
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.520]  There's no general Kelly in there as a filter
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:04.960]  Trump's got lawyers, he's got antitrust people
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:11.040]  He's got people he trusts from different U.S. intelligence agencies
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.800]  Who were supporters early on
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:13.840]  And then he knows they're good
[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.000]  And they're just reaching out and doing all the research
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.840]  And now they want all the proof from everybody
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.120]  And they're gonna take action
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:21.840]  That's the really exciting announcement
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.120]  It's up on infowars.com
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.520]  Don Salazar article
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.440]  Trump urges big tech censorship
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:30.480]  Talk all of a sudden
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.000]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.200]  Again, a very important story
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.560]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:42.240]  The links are at infowars.com
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:44.880]  Follow the story, follow the links, do it now

[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:51.120]  And when they censor it, share that with the White House
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.000]  See how they like it
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:54.960]  They like to troll and complain and get us banned
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.440]  We're gonna show how they're banning us and what they're doing
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.520]  And we're gonna take action
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.200]  Back in two minutes, we'll go right to your phone calls
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.560]  I see some of the callers saying
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:03.920]  Is Allie's gonna sue back?
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:05.920]  I've sued PayPal
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.560]  I've counter sued, I'm fighting all these other suits
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:09.600]  I've won most of them
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.640]  You never see that in the news
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.800]  I won two lawsuits the last month
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.560]  Yeah, if we have the money, I've got to sue Facebook
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:17.920]  They've listed me as a terrorist
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.000]  They've defamed me, trying to kill me, basically
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.400]  I've got to sue this G2 group
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.800]  That's listed me as a terrorist in their filings
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:25.600]  I mean, this is insane
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.520]  I have no criminal record, I have great credit
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:29.920]  You're just gonna put me in a database as a criminal and ruin my life?
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:32.320]  There's no jury gonna put up with your crap
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.680]  But no one's been fighting back, so they think they're green lit
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:39.680]  I tell you, the White House is looking at G2, all of it
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:41.760]  Just keep being arrogant, you Boston boys
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.800]  Now, briefly, because I haven't even plugged the cellar
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.800]  The 25% off the amazing X2
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:51.920]  Everybody's got to research and look into the iodine conspiracy
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:53.920]  What it does to your health, when you don't have it
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:55.520]  What it does for your health, when you do have it
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.400]  IQ, energy, fertility, everything
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:00.080]  X2, 25% off

[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:10.320]  That synergistically work together

[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:42.880]  And say goodbye to fatigue
[01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.880]  That's infowarslife.com
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:15.880]  We're listening to Alex Jones
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.880]  We're going to go to Jeffery and Canada and Andrew and
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:39.880]  Lander and Josh and Mike and Leslie and Nick and Ryan and so many others
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.880]  But Mike and Texas, the head of Gavin McGinnis joining us
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.880]  Let's talk about Commander and Chief Trump, indictments, criminal charges
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.880]  What Trump needs to do, what's on your mind
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:48.880]  Thanks for calling
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.880]  Thanks for taking my call out
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.880]  I do appreciate everything you all do
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:53.880]  The support you want to can
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:54.880]  Thank you, sir
[02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:58.880]  There's three things that you didn't cover and stuff that are very important
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.880]  Number one, Trump needs to start
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.880]  Looking into the exact limits of his executive authority
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:06.880]  Not only being Commander and Chief
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.880]  Just the limits of his office, what he can and what he can get away with doing
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:14.880]  Number two, he needs to stop telegraphing what he's going to do
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:19.880]  And just do it and then after the fact tell people why he did it
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.880]  Because perception is reality to these people
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:28.880]  They want to create a false perception of anything that they do
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:30.880]  And they have to tell you about it
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.880]  Trump needs to quit telegraphing it, that's the third thing
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.880]  That's important and stuff, the president just needs to take the gloves off
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:41.880]  And start putting his people in jail, you know
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:44.880]  And get the Justice Department off their butts
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.880]  Quit investigating and looking into these things
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:49.880]  And start taking some action
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:53.880]  Even if it turns out and stuff to blow up in his face
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.880]  At least he'll be perceived as doing something instead of just tweeting and talking about it
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.880]  No, I totally agree with you
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:02.880]  We have to realize they're not stopping their attempted coup
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:06.880]  And it's not just Trump's right, it's his duty to defend the border
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:10.880]  And to secure the elections and all of it
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:12.880]  And they're never going to stop
[02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:16.880]  And so again, the swamp still keeps trying to act like it wants to compromise
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:20.880]  So Trump acts like compromising with that, it's not going to compromise
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.880]  This is so true
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.880]  I noticed I haven't really heard a lot of you program but
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.880]  We also still have a problem and stuff with people that are speaking out
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:34.880]  And activists that are still either quote unquote, suiciding themselves
[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.880]  Or disappearing or dying off
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:41.880]  So I really want to urge you and your crew and everyone else stuff
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:43.880]  To take as many precautions as you need to
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.880]  No, I hear you, well they've got some weird green light with a stay behind thing inside the government
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:51.880]  To kill veterans that the computer decides are a threat
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.880]  And so because you were in the military, there's some weird thing where they believe they own you
[02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.880]  It's not constitutional, Trump doesn't know about it
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:02.880]  They have been killing a lot of veterans with key understanding of things
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.880]  Because they're planning a violent revolution
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:09.880]  And they've identified individuals they believe would be leaders in resistance during that period
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.880]  And so yeah, I don't want to make folks paranoid but it's definitely been going on in a big way
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:16.880]  I'll just leave it at that
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:21.880]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Andrew in New York and then Jeffrey in Canada, you're on the air
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:25.880]  Hi Alex, great for you to take my call, I really appreciate it
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.880]  Appreciate you
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:31.880]  I called during the AMA in March, it's great to talk to you again
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.880]  Listen, in regards to the election meddling, I don't know if you remember
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:39.880]  But I think her name is Dev Harris, you had her on a call
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:42.880]  Yeah, black box voting, she's a liberal, nonpartisan
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.880]  She says that they tried to steal the election from Trump in 2016
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.880]  I don't think they ever stopped that, I think they kept doing it and they're going to do that again
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:54.880]  And I think that's like the biggest non-talked about thing in just all the public consciousness
[02:03:54.880 --> 02:03:59.880]  Like I think that is a really big thing they're going to use to steal the election
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.880]  Doesn't Soros and a whole bunch of other people own stock in these companies like
[02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:07.880]  He owns a controlling interest in the largest company that about half the voting is done in the US
[02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:10.880]  So it's unbelievable just how brazen they are
[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:17.880]  It's ridiculous and I feel that that's an issue that needs to be raised to people like Trump and the others around him that are on our side
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:24.880]  The capitalized on what your first caller and Tom Pappard and what I spoke about last time
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  The neocons, you just mentioned it, big thread
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:32.880]  Again, I think they're more dangerous than they are enablers of the leftist
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:38.880]  They systematically enable them and we need to, you know, keep raising that because I think
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  I totally agree, Andrew, I could talk to you all day but Gavin McGinnis is coming up
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  And yes, his brother's going to join us as well and his brother's a crazy leftist
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:48.880]  Wait, and we'll take your calls too
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:05:17.880]  Don't everybody hang up, Gavin McGinnis coming up, stay with us
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:23.880]  You guys are even better for your telomeres, for your cells, your mitochondrial DNA, for your nerves, for your brain
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:28.880]  If there's one thing you take it should be DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more
[02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.880]  And all apparel, you'll leave this once a year, annual super sale, all apparel,
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:39.880]  Ballcaps, T-shirts, sweatshirts, footies, 50% off, 50% off store-wide
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:42.880]  And you help fund the info war and you spread the word and you stand up to the bullies
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:48.080]  up to the bullies. Storewide apparel sell 50% off and so much more and your funding makes it all
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:53.600]  possible. Whatever you do get DNA forced today. It's discounted but it's about to sell out. We'll be right back.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:05.600]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones for example.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:14.080]  Alex Jones. The far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.080]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:27.520]  Scott. Russian. Scott.
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:34.000]  Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:50.480]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed I hope.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:54.960]  Scott.
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:02.000]  Gavin McInnis. Founder of Vice.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:10.160]  Journalist. Comedian. One of the most banned people in the world.
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:13.360]  Giants just will continue with your calls throughout the hour.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:21.520]  And when you hear them talk about Gavin on the news they go this far-right extremist
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:27.360]  hate figure. Well remember we got to emails a month and a half ago when Facebook had the
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:35.760]  media internally lobbying to ban us off the air. They said if we could designate Jones as a hate
[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:47.440]  figure like Gavin McInnis then we could just say you can't even say his name unless it's in
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:52.560]  a negative light. And of course everybody from Sean Hannity, the president of Tucker Carlson
[02:07:52.560 --> 02:08:00.560]  has covered this and just said this is insane. So they don't just silence you. They then lie
[02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:04.560]  about you once they've done it. And so I've got all the articles, the internal emails and
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:10.560]  all of it. We're going to go over this because this is such a big deal because now they've
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:16.000]  designated me as that hate leader and guess how they did it? We now have the letters
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:24.640]  that were sent to the media. They said he had Gavin on. Now remember what happened last year?
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.040]  We're going to walk through this. In fact I meant to do it before the show and I got busy
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:34.000]  and didn't do it. Guys type in proud boys designated hate group. The FBI never said it. There was no
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.480]  judge. There was no jury. But even the FBI who can't just act like God and say this is a terror
[02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:46.960]  group didn't say it. They're just interviewing some FBI. He's like well you know these extremist
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:54.960]  groups that are these anti-fun, proud boys. So off of that banking groups like G2 that works with
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:59.440]  Interpol just said oh my god an FBI agent said so. Well a week later the FBI came out and said we
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:05.040]  did not say Gavin McGinnis or his group is an extremist or a terror or a violent group.
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:07.840]  And so
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:18.400]  they then took him off. And then now they say Jones had Gavin on in the internal Facebook
[02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:26.000]  documents document cam shot police. And they say because of that it's the final straw because I
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:34.320]  touch Gavin who has these cooties. Now you see anyone else that talks to me it is. This is the
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:42.240]  opposite of innocent until proven guilty. This is Soviet Union on PCP. While individuals poster
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:46.720]  pages created by M4s and Alex Jones have been removed the past. The full ban comes after Jones
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:53.280]  hosted Gavin McGinnis. This is talking points put up on Facebook. Founder of far right group
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:59.840]  proud boys and a designated hate figure on the platform on a show. A Facebook spokesman said
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:07.760]  and it goes on from there. And now they've told all their 2.4 billion I kept saying 2.2 billion
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:12.880]  users if you praise any of these people or defend them you're banned too you'll be one.
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:20.080]  That's racketeering that's such a mafia criminal activity. To list us as all this and with a
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:29.280]  straight face this is Forbes. Forbes the assassin of truth. It was Forbes that said that I was banned
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:33.120]  off YouTuber beating up a 10 year old child. Never beat up a 10 year old never been arrested
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:38.240]  wasn't me in the video they just defamed me made it up. They retracted a week later though after
[02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:49.200]  the damage was done. Look at this article out of the BBC. The Facebook memo said that Jones had
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:56.000]  hosted on his program Gavin McGinnis. Leader of the proud boys whose members are known for
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.760]  racist anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Mr. McGinnis has been designated a hate figure and
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:07.440]  that all came of the Southern Prairie Law Center saying and he's now suing them and their whole
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:13.440]  operation is falling apart as the rats leave the sinking ship. Gavin thank you for coming on.
[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:16.560]  I guess I'm in even more trouble because people are going to be able to actually hear what you
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.080]  have to say and hear what I say and you know learn that none of what they say about you is
[02:11:22.080 --> 02:11:28.000]  true. I'd almost call you a classical liberal not even a right winger. I mean what would you call
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.720]  yourself? What would you call me? I mean this is so Arwellian. It makes me wonder is this really
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.320]  a simulation? You want to talk Arwellian. Remember when Laura Loomer was on your show
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:43.040]  and she was having a breakdown. She was saying I don't know what to do.
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:53.600]  What? Yes sir we're live. Can you hear me? Yeah I'm not sure what's going on with our audio but
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:58.800]  you're live. Okay so you can hear me okay. I hear you great just go ahead and start over.
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:04.240]  All right so Laura Loomer was freaking out on your show right and she was saying I don't know
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:09.120]  what to do Alex. We wanted to discuss that on our show. I'm banking up a bunch of shows. I got a
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:15.920]  new project launching soon and the only place I could find that footage on YouTube was making fun
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:21.600]  of her. It was a cartoon clip where the ghost space ghost is mocking her. So they're controlling
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:26.720]  the narrative to the point where the only way you can discuss me, you, Paul Joseph Watson,
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.840]  Myleon Opposite and these people is to lampoon them. If you were to say I don't know Alex Jones
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:36.000]  seems like a decent guy or even if you were to say I don't even understand what exactly is the
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.880]  problem with conspiracy theories aren't they just theories about people conspiring. That would get
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:45.680]  banned. So the only way you can discuss us is to criticize us. You call, you compare it to
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:51.920]  Soviet Russia. I think we've gone beyond that. Soviet Russia would allow you to go on a gulag
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.960]  and you could pay your pennants. This is irrevocable. We are verboten forever.
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:06.000]  We sit here in this position being tyrannized. And if you study history, once a tyranny gets
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  people in the capacity of accepting it by incrementalism, people pretty much always end
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.200]  up succumbing to it. I mean, this is a really dark, dangerous time.
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:23.440]  Yeah. And they're basing their views on us on what our critics have to say about us.
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:30.000]  So it's like if you want to get an opinion on the Yankees, you talk to a Mets fan. Well, Mets fans
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.520]  hate the Yankees and they go, you see the Yankees are hate figures. The Yankees are a hate team.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.560]  And you go, have you ever seen them play? Like, have you ever watched the game? No,
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:44.000]  they've never heard us in context. And there's a plethora of content out there where you and I
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:50.160]  are saying things in context, but they're not interested in that. They're profoundly incurious.
[02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:54.640]  So they just take the comedian soundbite where he said, I hate this guy because of this little
[02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:59.520]  blip. And we've seen guys like Jim Jeffries take Abba Yimini out of context and make him into
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:04.480]  some sort of hate figure. And they go, good, I'm running with it. I don't think they even believe
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:09.360]  it. I think they just go, I need fodder to prove that the Yankees suck. So I'm just going to take
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:14.240]  this Mets fan's word. I don't really care about baseball. They don't care about the truth. They
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:20.480]  just want to run with this juvenile narrative. Well, yeah, they're authoritarians and they're
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:25.040]  making their move and big techs allied with dying corporate media and dying political systems and
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:29.920]  the Chai comms and the EU and Hollywood and all this. And they're just going, yeah, we're thugs.
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:34.160]  We're making our move. And now they're saying, we're going to take your banking away. We're
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:37.680]  going to harass you at your house. I mean, it's happening to me. It's happening to you.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.400]  They are really, really pushing it, Gavin. Where do you think all this goes?
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:49.280]  We have to start our own pirate ships and fight back. The movie that we just did together,
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.840]  I was just watching it today and I was kind of discouraged watching myself
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:57.920]  because they did it right after I was fired. And I was definitely at a low point. It's before you
[02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:03.040]  gave me that pep talk and said we can rebuild him. And it was before I realized what a clown world
[02:15:03.040 --> 02:15:09.600]  we're living in. And I'm very different now. I'm ready to fight. I box every morning.
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:15.200]  I'm in it to win it. And back then it was like the second round and I was lying on the mat thinking
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:20.400]  there's no future here, but I feel differently now. I think they're just making us stronger.
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:26.000]  They're making us more resilient. And I feel like I'm a better fighter for all of this abuse.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.440]  No, I totally, I absolutely agree. Let's talk about this new film, which is independent of
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:36.080]  the urine I'm in and three other people that have been these underpersons that is now only
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:41.600]  available at Vimeo for download or saving. Everybody is an act of resistance should go to

[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:05.680]  prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:10.480]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.880]  children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking ogres. If you're ready to flee the city

[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:32.880]  claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:39.760]  foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:46.240]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:54.000]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:03.600]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.880]  effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula. Everybody knows
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:14.640]  about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things it's associated with and then it's been
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:19.040]  the big craze for at least a decade. Well, thousands of years ago it's what everybody told people they
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.600]  should drink in a soup if they were sick. But then you add not just the fact this is the strongest,
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:29.120]  most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally. Then you have the chaga
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.760]  mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key
[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:39.920]  ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy. Our ultimate bone
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:45.200]  broth formula is amazing. It's 50% off right now in FullWareStore.com because I want you to try it
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:48.560]  and see how great it is. And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:53.920]  family. It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists
[02:18:53.920 --> 02:19:00.960]  and fighting for all of our freedoms. Stacey in the great state of Texas. In FEMA Region 6,
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:05.680]  you're on the air worldwide, Stacey. Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say,
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:09.600]  I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.560]  Ultimate Female Force. I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:18.720]  that I trust. You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:22.240]  they say that they have in them. And they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.480]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force? Tell us about it.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.920]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.000]  doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste. And you know,
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.680]  it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like it. Well, just so you
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:40.080]  know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo-charge women. And then we
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:46.560]  get the organic ones and put it in it. So yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:20:05.920]  in Ultimate Female Force. So I'm glad you plugged it. Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:24.400]  All right, you want to go? It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:20:26.800 --> 02:20:32.400]  Gap McKinnon just said it all. He said, we've got to create our own little pirate ships like
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:38.240]  Infowars, our own ecosystems, our own websites, our own platforms, because the system is abusing
[02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:43.120]  its power, its surveillance, its censorship. And just like they've destroyed so many
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:49.840]  patriots in the past, well now in the 21st century, we can rebuild them. And when Gavin was here four
[02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:54.240]  months ago or so, and just been de-platformed, was being lied about, he hadn't countersued yet,
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.200]  he hadn't decided to take action. I am proud of the fact that he stayed a few days, went on to eat,
[02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:04.560]  we hung out, and I, you know, put some good whiskey in him and some good Tomahawk steaks.
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:08.720]  And I said, damn it, son, you're a trailblazer. You've been a leader. Everything you've done
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.080]  has been successful. You're not going to be happy unless you fight back. They were harassing his
[02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:16.400]  wife, they were stalking his family, they were calling him a Nazi, taking his bank accounts away,
[02:21:16.400 --> 02:21:19.840]  and you know what, he fought back and now they're even more pissed. And they're saying,
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:24.640]  if you support him, we're going to come after you. Well, you know what, we're all Spartacus now,
[02:21:24.640 --> 02:21:29.360]  but it's the audience that is in the arena. This is a place where you're not some passive
[02:21:29.360 --> 02:21:33.680]  audience. When you support us, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy our products,
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:38.320]  when you watch the films we're in, you are carrying the ball down the field and rubbing it in the
[02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:43.520]  eye of the establishment and beating them because they're selling lies and AOC saying the world's
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:48.800]  ending. We're selling a future and a reality that works. Show. Six million dollar man,
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:53.520]  ladies and gentlemen, Gavin McGinnis, Alex Jones. We are all, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:56.480]  that six million dollar man, and it's you that have rebuilt us. Here it is.
[02:21:56.480 --> 02:22:08.720]  It's one more step for man, one step for man. One minute. Someone's keeping their microphone.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:12.880]  Okay, stand mic for systems. Okay, Steve. Okay, you got it out. Someone's keeping it, buddy.
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:19.680]  Let's go to districts. Let's try to have 32nd accessories. Roger, at 008, hold us in.
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.960]  So again, folks, we're promoting
[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:29.200]  Americana in the face of the globalist. Of course, they're going to come after us.
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:34.400]  But folks, get that now. This is 21st century war.
[02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.800]  Info wars is a flag in the symbol of the fight. They want to capture it. You get it.
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:53.920]  You've been holding the flag up, despite hell.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:23.520]  Steve Austin, astronaut, a man barely alive.
[02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:34.080]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:45.760]  world's first pionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before.
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:56.000]  Better, stronger, faster. All right, so let's get back to Gavin who's on fire today. I want to
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:00.640]  take your calls coming up. I appreciate everybody holding. But we're not little bitches here whining
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:05.440]  about all this. We're effective. Gavin has launched major national advertising movements,
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:11.760]  launched vice magazine and TV. That's why they fear him. Paul Watson has done incredible things.
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:14.960]  That's why they fear him. I've done amazing things. Our audience has done amazing things.
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:19.840]  Matt Drudge has done unbelievable things. We're the good guys, Dammit. We've proven it.
[02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:23.840]  And we've delivered Trump, and he's delivered a lot so far. He's in battle. We've got to do more.
[02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.640]  But audience, I'm going to go back to you again. Dammit, you know how amazing you are
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.880]  and what you've done. And so we're in this fight still together. But I'm telling you,
[02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:38.560]  it's an incredible time, Gavin. Yeah, you know, one thing I want to make clear too is I think a
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:44.720]  lot of us are decent human beings on the right and conservatives and Christians. And we, as they
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:51.760]  dehumanize us, we humanize them. And we, like in that movie, we see Tommy Robinson has had to
[02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:56.720]  relocate his family again. And he may have to leave the country entirely. I want to make something
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:01.600]  very clear to the right. You know that the left sees that as a victory, right? That the left has
[02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:07.520]  gone way past empathy or sympathy. Now they're about nothing but vindictive revenge. And I think
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:12.000]  a lot of us go, Hey, man, look at Dana Lash. She had to pack up overnight and move to a home.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.920]  Oh, yeah. Oh, listen, listen, I'm not relocating. You come to my house being violent. I'll blow
[02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:21.840]  your head off. And I'm not putting Tommy down. He's got a lot of courage. But I get him wanting
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:26.080]  to protect his daughters. It's just that, you know, people, you know, you come into me harm,
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:32.320]  you gonna die. So go ahead. These people are ruthless. They want us dead. And when they see
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:39.120]  us suffering, they love every minute of it. If Ann Coulter died, there would be hilarious memes
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:45.200]  about her before her body was cold. They did it to Roger Ailes. We are dealing with an unprecedented
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:50.720]  vindictiveness. It started with daddy issues. And now it's down to people who, but you just said
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:55.600]  it, I'm giving the floor next segment, but they have no chivalry. They have no sense of decency.
[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.560]  Because you don't want bad stuff happening to you. You don't want your kids in the fight. So you
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:02.720]  don't mess with their kids. It's a normal instinct. They have no bottom. What's wrong with them?
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.520]  Well, when they hear something like, you know, our children are being threatened, our children are
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.920]  in danger, they, their takeaway with that is, well, he shouldn't have put his kids in danger.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:18.720]  What a dummy. Tommy Robinson shouldn't have done that to his kids. So they are incapable of seeing
[02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:23.680]  any kind of humanity. And we have to recognize that we have to know our enemy and our enemy is
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:33.040]  devoid of empathy. Our enemy is purely ruthless. And, and, and I see with this in my life, the weak
[02:26:33.040 --> 02:26:38.400]  who are given petty power are always the biggest abusers, the biggest war criminals. They're really
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:43.680]  strong tend to have a built in chivalry or a governor. And there's just something about the
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:50.880]  left of how pathetic they are that they'll just do anything. Well, they want to normalize the freaks
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:56.880]  because they're freaks. How many Antifa have been arrested for disgusting sexual behavior,
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:04.160]  like Mika Rhodes, the head of Portland Antifa, who had raped several couples, young men and women,
[02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:11.040]  pre adolescent men, boys and girls. And you realize, Oh, the reason that you're trying to destroy society
[02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:18.800]  is that you are incompatible with normal society. So you want to make us all evil freaks. The idea
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:24.000]  that they're calling all these people racist, putting proud boys in jail who have black wives,
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:29.200]  this has nothing to do with Nazis, nothing to do with truth. This is all about crushing the enemy
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  and crushing Trump. And if you support Trump, and you're even mildly influential, they have
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:41.920]  to lie about you and try to destroy you. And the only solution is to fight back. Because if you
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:48.240]  don't fight back, they'll keep treading on you. And that Gavin is your big crime. We'll talk about
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:52.960]  that and go to calls when we come back and talk about the new film you're in. The big crime is
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:57.840]  proud boys goes out Western chauvinism, black, white, gay, straight, whatever you go out there.
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:28:02.240]  Antifa keeps attacking you 10 to one, you beat their asses. And the crime is, is that they're
[02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:06.480]  so pathetic, you're supposed to bow to the methad professors and let them beat you in the head of
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:10.800]  the club. But instead, you don't let them beat up women and children. They attack you, you kick
[02:28:10.800 --> 02:28:15.760]  their ass every time they can't stand it. I mean, they're such villains, you think in a fight,
[02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:18.880]  sometimes they'd win. No, they're that pathetic, they're scum.
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:27.280]  Well, and this whole idea of a hate group, it's what is a hate group? What is a hate figure?
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:32.640]  There's no logic to it at all. It's just silly, pedantic rhetoric. We all know the truth. The
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:38.080]  truth is that Antifa is the DNC's paramilitary wing. Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:44.560]  You're right, they're totally protected. And the big unspoken law is you don't mess with the
[02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:50.080]  methad army, pedophile army, you found out of them, you worship the methad anti for army,
[02:28:50.080 --> 02:28:54.160]  but they've actually now been officially listed as terrorists. Crowd Boys has them.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:59.840]  Everyone knows even good people fall on hard times, your credit cards get maxed out and you get
[02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:05.200]  behind on your taxes. Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding and they won't stop until
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.960]  they collect. They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:14.080]  home or business could be at risk. It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.

[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:00.880]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air. Thanks for calling Mike.
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:05.360]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:09.600]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for the
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:15.920]  bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:21.200]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk. It tastes like
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:27.680]  oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like good. I feel great since
[02:31:27.680 --> 02:31:33.840]  I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste. I've used the
[02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:38.400]  SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:41.760]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products. Give me some air. I'm thanking you.
[02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:46.400]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:50.080]  the true bone broth. It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.
[02:31:50.080 --> 02:31:52.480]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:32:02.720]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.280]  And get the fish oil.
[02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:02.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:21.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[02:33:21.280 --> 02:33:23.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:37.520]  So imagine the year 2019 individuals that stand up to armed groups of meth head
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:42.800]  thugs wearing masks. People who just go out and demonstrate and defend women and children
[02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:50.480]  are listed by the media as terrorists. And then everyone then follows suit to then
[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:54.720]  de-platform those individuals, harass them at their homes, even take their bank accounts.
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:58.880]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest. We'll take a few phone calls here in a moment on a host of issues
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:04.160]  of what Trump needs to do. But Gavin, getting into this film, censoredmovie.com,
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:08.640]  it's where people can download it or where they can watch it. You can rent it or buy the film
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:13.280]  that supports these great filmmakers who would dare blackball themselves by actually talking to
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:17.200]  undpersoned individuals. So you can decide for yourself what they actually said.
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:20.640]  You can't watch this. It's the name of the film. You can't watch this.com
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:26.240]  or just go to censoredmovie.com if you want to download it or stream it.
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:29.840]  Very important that everybody understands this is an act of resistance to do that
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:33.680]  and to share it with others. But Gavin, getting back to you, other points,
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.240]  or I've been asking a lot of the questions today, but I want you to get into other topics,
[02:34:38.240 --> 02:34:41.680]  other issues that you're focused on. You also wanted to bring this film up,
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:44.000]  what you think Trump should do, other points.
[02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:51.360]  Well, I just think that we have to understand what we're up against here. And I think that
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.160]  the right is too honorable sometimes. And we go, oh, there's the Antifa nuts,
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:03.760]  then there's a DNC, then there's the media. It's all one cabal. There's just different groups
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:11.520]  within this one. The DNC and Antifa are the same. And the prosecutors in our courts are also social
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:17.440]  justice warriors taking talking points from the DNC. Like after the pro-boys were arrested in New
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:23.440]  York, you saw de Blasio, the attorney general, Governor Cuomo all saying, oh, this hate group
[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:27.920]  is roaming the streets of New York just beating up random gays and Muslim people, all total and
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:31.600]  utter lies. But you think, okay, well, that's just going to stay with that one tweet. No,
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:38.000]  that leaked into the prosecution that leaked into into the court system that leaked into the media
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.360]  that leaked into Antifa. It's all the same. And I think the crime that proud boys committed was
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.040]  saying, all right, we've had enough of this. We've had enough of you harassing Milo and
[02:35:47.040 --> 02:35:52.720]  Ben Shapiro and moderates like Alan Dershowitz. We're going to protect them, these speakers,
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:59.600]  from you psychopaths. And that was a sin. Like at deplorable, they're throwing feces, batteries,
[02:35:59.600 --> 02:36:06.400]  and urine eddas, and we're the bad guys. That's the clown world we're living in. And I remember
[02:36:06.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  seeing an interview with the coming in Catholic school kids. And one of it was one of the most
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.200]  shocking sentences I've ever heard. The woman interviewing this, that kid who stood up to
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.440]  the, the Indian, it was banging drum in his face. She said, well, standing your ground,
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.200]  that's a little aggressive, don't you think? And that's where we're at today to stand your ground
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:30.000]  to say, no, I'm not a Nazi to say, no, you're not going to tell me what to think or how to vote
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.200]  or what to say. And what words to use, I'm not going to let you control my life. That is considered
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:42.240]  an act of aggression in Trump's America. It's bizarre. Well, if you look at the EU or Australia,
[02:36:42.240 --> 02:36:46.560]  New Zealand, defending yourself from someone raping your wife, attacking you, they'll throw you in
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:52.320]  prison and let the rapist or attacker go. So the ultimate crime in the leftist system is fighting
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.120]  back against them. You're just there to, you know, at the Washington Miami, you're there on a tour.
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:00.880]  People come over to you screaming your white scum, we're going to kill you. You know, the black
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.680]  Israelites for 30 minutes, they just edited together and say, look at these horrible white supremacists.
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:10.480]  They were supposed to just, I guess, just run to the hills and not wait for their bus. Totally sick.
[02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:16.240]  That's the world they want, where we're just constantly running in fear. And the irony is,
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:22.000]  okay, I'll constantly run in fear. Who's going to protect you, you liberal wimps? You need us.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.240]  You need the Archie bunkers to protect you because you don't know how to fight. You don't
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:30.880]  know how to fight tyranny. You know, it's very possible that the government is letting this mob
[02:37:30.880 --> 02:37:35.840]  rule do all their dirty work. And then once everyone's censored, now they can jump in and
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.400]  say, all right, I'll be controlling social media from here on in. I mean, we're already seeing
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:47.120]  Congress get involved in Facebook and the lines are blurring between Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:52.480]  and the White House. You know, I don't know where Trump is in all this. He seems to be absent. I
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:38:00.000]  guess he's busy on Twitter, but we seem to be losing the war with the mob and the war with the
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:05.600]  system itself. The government is also on board with these SJWs. Well, the only good news, though,
[02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:10.640]  in all this, Alex, is that they are incompetent boobs. Like, you look at who they're running with
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:16.080]  Bill de Blasio, the man who's turning New York City into San Francisco homeless bill,
[02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:21.440]  or Pete Buddygig, some random mayor in some small town who looks like Alfred E. Newman,
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:27.920]  or radicals like Ilhan Omar, who ridicules 9-11, or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who wants to get rid
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:32.240]  of all fossil fuels. In many ways, they're their own worst enemy. So I'm so confident Trump's going
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:38.560]  to win. And we will win in the long run. But right now, today, the lunatics are running the asylum.
[02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:41.920]  No, you're right. I want to go to some of these calls, but you mentioned the film,
[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.240]  and you had cut off by the break earlier. You were saying you went and saw the film,
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:49.840]  you can't watch this that you're in that was shot four months ago or so, your interview,
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:53.440]  when you were really down. But I think it's actually poignant and pretty powerful,
[02:38:53.440 --> 02:38:57.280]  the parts of the film you're in. So give a sure review of a censored movie.
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:03.760]  Well, I think it's great. I think the right will see it and go, Jesus, what the hell is going on
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:08.720]  with this country? I didn't realize things were that bad. I didn't realize, and I never say victim,
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:13.600]  I didn't realize that that conservatives were being targeted so much. These targets
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:18.960]  are being overrun for what? They're not Nazis, they're not bigots. So that's what the right
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.280]  and the sane and the curious people will get from it. But I think a lot of lefties, these
[02:39:23.280 --> 02:39:30.720]  vindictive little bitches, are going to go, haha, you ruined your life by speaking up against tyranny.
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:34.800]  They're going to enjoy the suffering, I'm afraid.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.560]  You're right. Okay. Again, I've got a problem. I've got so many phone lines. We get a lot of
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:44.480]  great calls and I can't ever get to everybody, but I'm trying here. Jeffrey in Canada,
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:48.960]  Trump's focused on the Fed and taking action on speech. I'm going to go to some other callers
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.720]  that are holding. Jeffrey in Canada, you're on the air with Gavin McInnis and myself.
[02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:57.840]  Thanks for holding. Thanks for calling. Go ahead. Well, it's an honor to be on the show and I want
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:04.080]  to thank you and Gavin and the crew at Info Wars. And earlier in the broadcast, you mentioned,
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:09.200]  what are you doing out to the audience? And one of the things I've been doing is I listened
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:13.920]  to your show. I've even purchased some of your products and I've decided to do my own website
[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:19.520]  and speak out about what's happening. And the free speech part is so critical. If you can't talk
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:25.600]  to each other in a living room or in a bedroom or in a school, then how can you get any progress?
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:33.040]  And so for what I think Trump should do is that he should basically do some sort of executive
[02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:38.000]  action to take the internet back, because if he's able to re-consolidate the internet back into the
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:44.640]  U.S. system, it could literally take and basically almost break the back of the social credit system
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:49.440]  that's being rolled out worldwide. And this whole thing about unpersoning people is really
[02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:55.280]  the American, the North American version of the social credit system. And so this is very, very
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.400]  important. And also, too, that the, even President Trump speaking about the internet being given away
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:04.880]  under the Obama administration to the United Nations, the gentleman named Morgan Wright
[02:41:04.880 --> 02:41:10.320]  is a cyber expert. He was talking about this on the news, so people should look into that.
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:16.320]  But more importantly, President Trump mentioned, I think in 2016 in the speech, he says that there's
[02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:22.320]  the weakness and incompetence of the United Nations is something that he's going to be...
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:27.280]  Exactly. You just said it. Obama handed the internet over as soon as Trump got elected
[02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:32.080]  when he was at lame duck to sabotage things. And so it's not even about a censorship issue.
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:38.240]  That's important. For me, it's about the fact that we're letting foreign powers come in and take our
[02:41:38.240 --> 02:41:42.560]  rights and having Facebook and everybody else line up with their regulations. And Congress goes,
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:47.760]  it's a private company. Europe's not doing that. Thank you so much. Great point, Jeffrey. Gavin.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:56.400]  Yeah, you know, another thing that's shocking about all of this censorship is their worst fear,
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:00.560]  the worst thing you could do, worse than being Alex Jones, worse than being a hate figure,
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:05.120]  the worst thing you could do right now is encourage debate between the right and the
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:10.960]  left to show, you know, Cornel West and Milo Yiannopoulos or to show Roger Stone and Shank
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:17.200]  Uger, to show Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley sitting together in a room discussing Trump's
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.880]  America. That's their ultimate nightmare because that will show the rest of the country that the
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:29.360]  right are not lunatic white nationalists are actually quite rational. And to show our similarities
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.000]  is the worst thing you could possibly do for the left because they've managed to make us into
[02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:39.840]  Gargamel from the Smurfs. And to have Gargamel sit down with a Smurf is the end of their crazy
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:44.560]  narrative. You said it, they need to project their lives on the Tea Party, Trump, everybody.
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:47.760]  That's why they're so desperate to shut down communications is because they know they're
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:43:00.880]  very close to losing. More calls with Gavin McInnis straight ahead. Stay with us.

[02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:21.360]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but

[02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:47.920]  it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half pack at the first time you take it

[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:30.960]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones here live with Gavin McGinnis.
[02:47:31.520 --> 02:47:34.080]  I'm taking your phone calls right now, coming up.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:39.360]  Matt Bracken toasts at the fourth hour ahead of the war room. But I'm looking at these headlines.
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:44.160]  We're not whining about the censorship of ourselves. It's how draconian it is,
[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:48.800]  how then these big tech companies lie to Congress. This happened a few days ago.
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:54.880]  Facebook censors Michelle Malkin for a post about Laura Loomer and Gavin McGinnis
[02:47:56.320 --> 02:48:01.200]  and myself. She just linked to an article and said, it's wrong to censor these people.
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:07.360]  This is dangerous, so they shut her account down. So again, we're going to silence people.
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:12.720]  And if you don't like it, you're silence. Oh, but we're not censoring. They tell Congress,
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.920]  you know, I just saw Trump during the break. He's live at a press conference.
[02:48:17.920 --> 02:48:21.120]  The Democrats are already bitching that he wants to deport MS-13.
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:27.920]  As Pelosi said, all God's children. So Gavin, I mean, there's no mistake. The globalists and
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:31.440]  the forces that work with them are trying to conquer this country. It's very simple.
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.680]  Isn't it bizarre? I mean, we've talked about this before, but your company's called Info Wars.
[02:48:37.680 --> 02:48:43.440]  And I saw Stephen Colbert joking around going, looks like Alex Jones lost his war on Info.
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:50.800]  And you go, yeah, that's exactly what happened. That's not a joke. And I think this sort of
[02:48:50.800 --> 02:48:56.400]  boomer left, all of these people, by the way, that we're having trouble with are rich white people.
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:01.760]  And it's under the auspices of fighting for equality. But don't these dummies realize
[02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:08.480]  they're making us cool? That's why I wore this motorcycle jacket. They are Gen Y, Gen Z,
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:12.640]  these younger people, they're going, oh, they're verboten. You mean like rock and roll in the 50s
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:18.080]  where they would burn records because it was Satan's music. They're making us fun and exciting.
[02:49:18.080 --> 02:49:25.120]  And they are showing themselves to be weak and incapable of debate and incapable of handling
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:30.320]  differing opinions. They're making themselves look really bad and they're making us look really cool
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:36.400]  and good, especially to young people. But their arrogance says, well, we'll just censor them too
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.720]  and we'll tell people not to promote it. And I don't see it lasting long term. You're on about
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:45.760]  three years ago. And I said, what is peak leftist derangement? He said, you said, well, I don't
[02:49:45.760 --> 02:49:51.920]  think we've got anywhere close to it. Tomorrow, we're going to air a compilation of not two years
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:56.720]  ago or three years ago, but the latest stuff in the last year of all the leftist attacks and insanity.
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:03.120]  And when you go out in public, they're just all like crazed maniacs. These entitled zombies on
[02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:08.560]  methamphetamine. Where do you think they're going to go from here? Because I think Trump's going to
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:12.720]  win. I think globalism is going to continue to decline. There's all these international reports
[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:18.320]  that the EU is about to collapse. The CHICOM economy is falling apart. Trump does have
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:21.600]  grand juries criminally investigating the Democrats. I mean, what are they going to do is
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:27.520]  things just get worse and worse for them. They're going to get more violent and they're going to
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:32.560]  get more destructive. But what you're going to see after Trump wins is two Americas. There's going
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:38.880]  to be reality where the economy is booming, where China's got slapped in the wrist and then understands
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:44.400]  they can't mess with us anymore, where immigration is getting curbed, where I hope a wall is starting.
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:49.200]  But at the very least, we will not have the open borders we've been dealing with since George W.
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:56.000]  Bush. And that will be what's actually going on. Then they'll be almost half the country that will
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:03.680]  be in clown world where in their minds, in their day-to-day behavior, the most extreme, far right
[02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:09.200]  Richard Spencer, David Duke, Andrew Anglin, Daily Stormer, all of these far, far right guys that
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:16.240]  make up a tiny sliver of the right, a tiny, tiny sliver. In their minds, that will just be like
[02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:23.680]  60% of the country. So they will be walking around in basically a movie, a crazy movie that doesn't
[02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:31.440]  exist, where America is a Nazi hellhole of bigotry and hatred, and they'll live their lives accordingly.
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:39.120]  It's we're about to see an almost like North Korean dystopia where reality and people's perception
[02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:44.480]  are not even in the same universe. And that's the thing we see. Every blue city is going bankrupt
[02:51:44.480 --> 02:51:51.920]  and collapsing. Every blue city is ratcheting up taxes. Every blue city is doubling down on everything
[02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:59.040]  and everyone's fleeing them as they just delusionally stomp around like all of America is some SJW
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:05.680]  university just howling at the moon about Nazis. It's insane. And it could lead to a civil war,
[02:52:05.680 --> 02:52:11.200]  clown world versus the real world. And the irony is both agree like what proud boys are fighting
[02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:18.800]  these anti-fascists. They're saying, yeah, dummy, we hate fascism too. Everyone does. Trump is not
[02:52:18.800 --> 02:52:25.520]  Hitler, dumbass. We both hate tyranny. We're both. But they don't hate tyranny. They're the
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:33.040]  tyrants that project their authoritarianism onto us. Yeah, they don't like certain types of tyranny.
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:39.360]  It's like tyranny for me, but not for thee. And the irony is in our version of events,
[02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:43.920]  everyone's freer. There's more freedom. There's more anarchy. There's less government.
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:49.440]  Trump is the most punk rock anarchist president we've ever had. Reagan was a punk rocker.
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:54.240]  Margaret Thatcher was a punk rocker. They all wanted to destroy the government. They all hated
[02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:59.600]  the government. And then you get these big government anarchists, whatever the hell that means,
[02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:05.360]  who can't wait for more regulations and more rules and more discipline and less freedom.
[02:53:05.360 --> 02:53:11.120]  I mean, you just got to sort of just shake your head and keep fighting because we're dealing with
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:17.520]  the good times has created some weak men and we are dealing with the pusification of America.
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:22.960]  Well, men now think running up a white flag and grobbling is a cool thing to do.
[02:53:22.960 --> 02:53:26.800]  It's a bunch of conformity. It's very, very bizarre.
[02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:34.240]  You know, Mark Rufler, the guy that plays the Hulk. I saw a tweet he put up right before Ilhan
[02:53:34.240 --> 02:53:41.040]  Omar was elected and Alexandria Cortez was elected. He was literally holding a white handkerchief
[02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:48.640]  like this in the tweet. And he was saying, goodbye, patriarchy. See, this is a man who is
[02:53:48.640 --> 02:53:53.440]  a patriarch, by the way. He has kids and he's sitting there holding a literal white flag,
[02:53:53.440 --> 02:54:00.080]  waving goodbye to the patriarchy. That's our incredible Hulk today. Great, great work, America.
[02:54:00.080 --> 02:54:06.720]  Well, I mean, clearly all of this is a demoralize the human family. Notice that China won't allow
[02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:12.000]  any Hollywood propaganda into China, but they but they're financing most of it here. It's just so
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:20.640]  bizarre to see this kind of follower class, all acting like street gang thugs, trying to make
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:25.600]  us conform to what they're wanting to build and wanting us to conform to their delusions. It's
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:31.440]  just it's like mass psychosis. Well, what do you do when you're a spoiled brat and you have no
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:36.000]  culture and you feel like you're lacking discipline, you feel like a spoiled brat,
[02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.320]  and you look at your baby boomer dad who though he's rich now, he grew up kind of poor and you're
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:45.920]  and you think, I have no substance. I see the freedom riders riding in the south in the 60s,
[02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:50.640]  fighting for justice. I wish I had something like that. I know I'm just going to take it all out on
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:57.200]  daddy. So so much of this stupid leftist culture is daddy issues that let's make Homer Simpson
[02:54:57.200 --> 02:55:02.720]  a bumbling buffoon. Let's talk about white males on the money, the dead presidents. Let's talk about
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:08.560]  how much we hate dads, basically smash the patriarchy means I hate you daddy. And it's basically
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:13.760]  a kid running up to his room and saying, I hate it here and slamming the door so hard that his
[02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:19.680]  little name tag that's on the front falls off onto the really a spoiled rotten lunatic. He'll
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:24.480]  like pooping his bed or something, which every city around my leftist, even homeless, I'm sure
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:29.360]  he's hitting the news, you know, they call the Portland poopers, the men go out and poop to
[02:55:29.360 --> 02:55:36.160]  show how powerful they are. So everyone's just crapping everywhere. Lord of the flies and San
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:41.920]  Francisco is the beginning. I mean, we need to see the future ahead of us. Ezra Levant was
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:47.520]  describing London as a dystopian time machine where you can see where we're going to be
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:51.360]  in about five years. And I think that's a very accurate assumption. And you can even see it
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:56.640]  within America is Dem run cities. They're all going to be like San Francisco soon. New York
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:02.560]  is is a minutes away from being commie for Nya. We're going to see it everywhere. Detroit,
[02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:12.480]  East New York, what's it called the B town, Burlington, no, the Baltimore,
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:16.800]  Baltimore, they're all going to be the same soon. And it's going to be the, the, the rain of the
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:22.000]  homeless. By the way, I'm a little scared of how I talked about Portland poopers and they pulled
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:26.720]  it up within three seconds where you guys like already on Portland pooper. I haven't talked about
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:30.480]  that in like a month and just like instantly I said Portland pooper. It was like on screen for
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.240]  TV viewers. Look at him. But this is a fun off these men. Like it's there. It's sort of sacrament
[02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:39.440]  to do something bad. And it's like, Oh, I'm a bad. I'm naughty. I pooped on the street corner.
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:44.560]  And they have liberal women like I liked it. I like men pooping. It's fun. It's liberal. Oh,
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:52.080]  my God. It's a sexy poop on me. Wow. Gab McGinnis, the verboten film, you can't watch this is the
[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:57.280]  name of the film. You can't watch this.com. It's where you go. Sensordmovie.com will take you

[02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:55.120]  Mike. You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:58:59.440]  fan. Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for
[02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:05.920]  the bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth. The bone broth.
[02:59:05.920 --> 02:59:11.040]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk. It tastes
[02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:17.520]  like oval team. It tastes like oval team. It tastes like oval team. Like good. I feel great
[02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:23.440]  since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride free toothpaste. Um, I'd use
[02:59:23.440 --> 02:59:28.480]  the, uh, super male vitality, a host of other products. So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.480 --> 02:59:32.080]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you. But
[02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:36.480]  yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[02:59:36.480 --> 02:59:41.200]  the true bone broth. It is next level. It really is good. So thank you. I feel great
[02:59:41.200 --> 02:59:42.560]  since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[02:59:48.640 --> 02:59:51.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:51.280 --> 03:00:20.480]  You're welcome back folks. Gavin McGinnis is leaving us here about four minutes. I'm going to come
[03:00:20.480 --> 03:00:23.920]  back, take your calls and Matt Braggins coming up. I promise to get your calls. We're into our
[03:00:23.920 --> 03:00:30.400]  best tears. I want to talk to you, but Gavin, I don't want people to think I'm a loser or I'm a
[03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:34.480]  victim. I've been attacked. You've been attacked because we've been effective relaunching common
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:39.440]  sense and success and standing up to a bunch of authoritarian losers and control freaks that are
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:44.560]  just comically ridiculous and have used our open free society to convert it to a tyranny almost
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:50.720]  overnight. The backlash, the pendulum is swinging back, but I'm quite frankly proud of the fact.
[03:00:52.080 --> 03:00:56.320]  I mean, it's not fun. Like you said, you're wearing a rebel without a cause
[03:00:57.840 --> 03:01:01.600]  jacket that you pull off quite well. I just looked like a black apple or something about
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:08.000]  where one, you know, but like a black balloon. But I mean, it is kind of fun to be rock and roll,
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.160]  but like this isn't like rock and roll where they were trying to cool or break in a guitar.
[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:16.400]  This isn't like outlaw country as they talk about smoking weed and having sex with women,
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:20.720]  which is fine. Whale and Jennings, all those guys love them. I mean, there's not been something
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:26.640]  this rock and roll ever. This is more rock and roll than rock and roll. And then you file suit,
[03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:29.840]  a bunch of other suits are getting filed. We're developing one against the Southern
[03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:33.760]  Primary Law Center, this terrorist organization that goes around doing this and suddenly their
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:38.320]  head guy, their deputy, they're all quitting. There's lawsuits starting internally. I mean,
[03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:44.240]  this is this is spectacular. So we're not rock and roll. We're not the new punk rock because
[03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:48.960]  we're way more radical and real and Americana than that. So what would I mean, we're not bragging,
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:53.760]  but it's just sorry, we're way more radical and cutting edge and more persecuted than the
[03:01:53.760 --> 03:01:59.360]  sex pistols and, and you know, people like Elvis or whatever, what would you call it?
[03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:04.720]  Yeah, that's a good point. I mean, that was fashion. And by the way, a lot of this is
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:08.320]  fashion back and forth. These people don't care about the truth. It's like I always compared to
[03:02:08.320 --> 03:02:12.160]  the mods and the rockers fighting on Brighton Beach, but they're fighting for some sort of silly
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:17.600]  gain. They don't like they call Trump an anti-Semite. It's the most pro-Jewish president imaginable.
[03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:22.880]  So they're not concerned about the facts, but they just want to win. And you're right.
[03:02:23.680 --> 03:02:28.960]  We are fighting not for some sort of like petty win. We're fighting for the very fabric of this
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:33.760]  country. This country is incredibly unique. It's built on grit. It's built on mobility.
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:37.760]  It's built on meritocracy. It's built on individualism. It's built on nationalism.
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:43.040]  It's built on Christianity. And it's built on this concept of let's give people freedom
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:47.840]  because we trust them. Come on over here, bust your ass and you can be rich too. Let's all climb
[03:02:47.840 --> 03:02:52.240]  aboard. And they are tearing away at that. They're pushing us left. They're trying to make us into
[03:02:52.240 --> 03:02:58.960]  Europe into the Soviet Union. They're trying to socialize us as socialists. And you just said
[03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:02.720]  that they're trying to break our will. We're fighting not just for the American way. We're
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:08.000]  fighting for our literal lives. We are being conquered by a bunch of control freaks. And we
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:13.920]  must rise to the occasion. And you've done it with your lawsuit against SPLC. Tell us about that.
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:19.920]  Yes. So the reason I fought the SPLC too is because they've infiltrated my Wikipedia. My
[03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:24.400]  Wikipedia doesn't sound like anyone I've even heard of before. They ruined the Proud Boys,
[03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:29.120]  got dozens of them fired. Every time you see an article talking about this hate figure crap,
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:34.000]  it's eventually linked back to the SPLC's false allegations. And I thought I've had enough. And
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.360]  the reason it's really important to fight these things is because you have to show the world
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:45.840]  what the truth is. You can't bow down and get walked all over like a Jared from Subway. Remember
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:50.400]  him? So he took a plea deal because they were calling him a pedophile. And I think he got
[03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:54.960]  15 years in jail. When you hear that, you go, holy crap, he must have been a real serious
[03:03:54.960 --> 03:04:00.480]  pedophile. If he's taking a deal, I'm not taking a deal. I'm not guilty of the things
[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:04.320]  they're saying. The Proud Boys, the three remaining ones, they're not taking a deal.
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:10.000]  And in the one minute you have left, as soon as you filed that suit, all the resignations,
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.040]  all the firings, it was like magic. They just started imploding.
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:21.600]  Morris Dees was fired for sexism and racism. Richard Cohen, the president, after laughing
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:26.480]  at me and saying this suit is frivolous, he was then forced to step down. They're head of legal,
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:31.120]  I assume, realizing there's going to be discovery. And we're going to see all the malicious behavior
[03:04:31.120 --> 03:04:36.320]  they're up to. She steps down. They are crumbling. The ACLU jumped in and tried to help them to
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:42.000]  dismiss this. The judge just told them, no, ACLU, you're not getting involved here. We just recently,
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:46.800]  a couple days ago, put in our motion to dismiss their motion to dismiss. I mean, we haven't even
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:51.600]  stepped in the ring. And they're already dropping like flies. Got an incredible, incredible great
[03:04:51.600 --> 03:04:57.840]  job. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars

[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:33.680]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me. Because I don't love you enough, you'll buy that.
[03:06:35.680 --> 03:06:40.640]  I got some push from... All right, now keep trying to go to your calls. And we got Matt
[03:06:40.640 --> 03:06:45.680]  Bracken coming up, so I'm pushing him back. And you got Trump just unveiled a merit-based
[03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:50.160]  immigration system. And I was sitting in there, trying to eat my lunch in four minutes, watching
[03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:55.120]  him. And I said, let me guess, this has been going on 30 minutes, he's released the text of it.
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:01.120]  I bet the Democrats are already decrying deporting convicted criminals, like MS-13,
[03:07:01.120 --> 03:07:06.720]  and sure as hell, it was already in the Washington Post. These people are predictable. I mean,
[03:07:06.720 --> 03:07:11.680]  Trump could have a cure for cancer, and they would say they didn't want it. It's just crazy.
[03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:19.440]  Speaking of that, there's an article on m4wars.com that is incredible. It's a zero-hedge article.
[03:07:20.480 --> 03:07:27.680]  And I knew this about Brennan, former head of national security. I didn't know it about
[03:07:27.680 --> 03:07:32.560]  Comey, but sure enough, they've got links to it. They both voted communist.
[03:07:32.560 --> 03:07:46.800]  Into the 1980s. Is that not crazy? The heads of Obama's FBI and CIA both voted for communist
[03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:52.480]  during the Cold War. It was somehow able to move up the ranks within the same U.S.
[03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:56.000]  intelligence community that has spent decades fighting that very ideology.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:03.360]  And then when I went and read this during the breaks, it's in mainstream news. They're both
[03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:09.280]  bragging. Comey's like, I'm a commie. He's like some eight-foot-tall, weird-ass Martian
[03:08:11.040 --> 03:08:15.840]  who obviously doesn't like, and you hear a communist, the big banks want you controlled
[03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:22.880]  under communism. They're all exempt from it. Wow. What a bunch of American hating trash.
[03:08:22.880 --> 03:08:26.160]  Boy, Joseph McCarthy sure got proven, right, didn't he?
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:33.760]  He never did one tenth of the persecution left doing of us right now. And notice they're calling
[03:08:33.760 --> 03:08:44.960]  us Russians. Unbelievable. Absolutely insane. All right, we're gonna go ahead and go to some
[03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:49.120]  of your phone calls now. And then I will play some of that Trump speech that Matt Bracken's
[03:08:49.120 --> 03:08:55.120]  gonna come on. So the first caller, we can put that call list back up on screen for me. Thank you.
[03:08:55.840 --> 03:09:00.960]  First caller I want to go to and then we're gonna get to Lander and William and others is
[03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:09.680]  Marilyn Patriot says that his wife and mother are pushing him, I guess, to get vaccines.
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:15.440]  And so I'm gonna find out what's happening or pushing for their child to have vaccines.
[03:09:15.440 --> 03:09:21.680]  So tell us what's happening, Marilyn Patriot. Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you. Thanks
[03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.600]  for taking my call. Appreciate you, brother. I want to plug your products, man. I'm a 49-year-old
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:33.120]  landscaper. I do patios, walks and walls and I couldn't do what I do without DNA force,
[03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:38.880]  bringing the feeling back and my three fingers on my left hand, the bodies every day to, you know,
[03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:44.880]  to calm my body, the super male vitality. If I had to pick one product to take and it was
[03:09:44.880 --> 03:09:51.120]  only what I could take with me on a on a ship or whatever, I would take the iodine, the silver
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:55.840]  bullet keeps me and my family, you know, from from being really sick, you know, keeps us keeps us
[03:09:55.840 --> 03:10:02.480]  clean and and a load of other. I got your air filter, your water filter and, you know, we're
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:11.680]  living good. I just I'm in a freaking war against my mother, my aunt and my and my wife with vaccines.
[03:10:11.680 --> 03:10:17.760]  I got a beautiful little boy coming in two weeks. Wow. And and and, you know, it's like I present
[03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:24.480]  information, right? And, you know, these women are stupid. You know, my wife's got two MBAs. I
[03:10:24.480 --> 03:10:30.880]  don't understand. Well, they get into hysteria and it's peer pressure and then they see all the
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:35.920]  stuff in the news. And so have you showed them that there's no safety testing on vaccines?
[03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:39.360]  Have you showed them they have liability protection? Have you read them the inserts of
[03:10:39.360 --> 03:10:44.880]  measles, mumps and rubella saying you can cause type one diabetes or Guillain berets or all sorts
[03:10:44.880 --> 03:10:48.960]  of autoimmune diseases or the children for at least a year, especially if they're breastfed,
[03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:54.880]  have childhood immunity, infant immunity. And if you give them vaccines, it can cause a permanent
[03:10:54.880 --> 03:10:59.280]  autoimmune disorder. I mean, have you actually gone to Walgreens or CVS and said, I don't want
[03:10:59.280 --> 03:11:04.160]  your fact sheet. I want the insert by law you're supposed to give me that comes in each bottle
[03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:09.520]  of it. I mean, have you gotten that? And it's as thin as Bible paper. It is Bible paper. And you
[03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:13.040]  can sit there and highlight it with a magnifying glass. It's the finest print you've ever seen.
[03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:17.600]  Okay, it's like a pocket Bible. And then you show them that. I mean, have you done that?
[03:11:18.640 --> 03:11:24.560]  No, that's my next step. I have to do that. That's the ace of spades. That shuts people up real fast.
[03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:30.720]  You know, it's from Brazil, right? We had my first son down there. And I fought her down there,
[03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:34.800]  but we were in Brazil, you know, there's a lot of third world stuff down there. And so I let her,
[03:11:34.800 --> 03:11:39.520]  you know, he got a probably a dozen vaccines over two years. And, you know, thank God,
[03:11:39.520 --> 03:11:44.000]  he's fine. He's bright. He's smart. But, you know, I'm, you know, it was ticking time bombs in him.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:50.560]  I realized that. But again, just, I mean, I can tell you to argue this. I'd say, honey, honey,
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:56.320]  I know that you can learn immunity from vaccines. I know they can attenuate viruses and bacteria.
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:01.520]  But even Japan says don't give kids vaccines until 18 months. They're more industrialized
[03:12:01.520 --> 03:12:06.400]  than us. India banned the Gardasil Shot that killed so many young girls and say, you know,
[03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:10.960]  they want to put hundreds of things in kids' bodies. You know that whatever else is in the shot,
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:15.600]  your body then creates an autoimmune response to for life. And just give her stacks of mainstream
[03:12:15.600 --> 03:12:23.840]  articles about autism up or autoimmune disorders being way up or allergies being associated with
[03:12:23.840 --> 03:12:28.800]  vaccines and just show them and say, well, okay, honey, 50 years ago it was three vaccines they
[03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:34.720]  wanted to push. Now it's 56. Soon it'll be 200. Should we give the baby 200 shots? Don't you get
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:40.000]  it? It's a newborn baby. You know, a bee sting could kill the baby. Well, what is in this? I mean,
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:47.760]  women have got to understand and men as well, autoimmune responses. How many people listening
[03:12:47.760 --> 03:12:52.320]  took a vaccine once and got real sick? Almost everybody. Everybody I know in the military,
[03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:58.080]  tough guys have gotten really, really sick. You can also read the vaccine epidemic,
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:05.440]  very powerful book available at infowarstore.com, 100% reviews, and give that to her. It's written,
[03:13:05.440 --> 03:13:10.000]  you know, by scientists, by experts, and it lays it all out. And let me tell you, mark my words.
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:16.480]  Monsanto and Bayer, explain this to them, are both in vaccines, okay, especially Bayer.
[03:13:16.480 --> 03:13:23.120]  Bayer knowingly gave millions of people HIV and a blood product that they knew had it in it. They
[03:13:23.120 --> 03:13:29.680]  just didn't care, okay? And it's the same thing with Monsanto and all the stuff they're doing.
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:35.520]  They're about to get bankrupted. Vaccine makers have liability, total protection. You've got to
[03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:41.840]  explain that. Say, hey, why can't other consumer groups that are allowed to talk about other issues
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:46.720]  talk about vaccines? Because it's their Achilles heel. If you think Monsanto and Roundup's bad,
[03:13:46.720 --> 03:13:54.080]  baby, it's mama's milk compared to what's in these vaccines. So that's for your wife and
[03:13:54.080 --> 03:14:02.960]  mother-in-law. This will be like 10 minutes into the fourth hour. So three hours, 10 minutes into
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:07.600]  the archive, it'll go up in a few hours, infowarstore.com, you can queue it right up for your wife.
[03:14:07.600 --> 03:14:13.520]  And you know what? I'll bet your wife for your child's future. One way bet. If she can prove wrong
[03:14:13.520 --> 03:14:20.160]  what I said, $10,000 to her. It's a one-way bet. God is my witness. We'll fly your wife here. I'll
[03:14:20.160 --> 03:14:26.960]  pay her $10,000 on air. $10,000. If she can prove anything I just said is wrong. You can't do it,
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:34.800]  lady. I got four kids. They've never had a shot. In Germany and China, they produce clean vaccines
[03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:39.520]  that cost thousands of dollars a shot because they go through with spectrometers, electron
[03:14:39.520 --> 03:14:45.920]  microscopes, and testers and screen everything out. Because then it actually has an effect. If
[03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:55.120]  you have anything else in it, your body creates an autoimmune response. Look up 1996 UN African
[03:14:55.120 --> 03:14:59.440]  doctors and Pakistani doctors and Indian doctors found they were adding a female hormone to the
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:05.200]  tetanus shot, giving it to women, and it was sterilizing them. And they were having miscarriages
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:10.160]  in the second trimester because it created an autoimmune response to that hormone. Ma'am,
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:18.640]  look up SV 40. And you'll have snopes. Oh, look, snopes says SV 40 is a cancer virus,
[03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:21.280]  and the government admits it gave people cancer, but not everybody.
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:28.800]  Snopes says the sky isn't blue. Look it up. God bless you, brother. I really appreciate your
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:35.360]  call. I appreciate it. Call me back. And like I said, get his name and number. $10,000.
[03:15:36.080 --> 03:15:41.040]  One way, she's not betting me. If she can prove, if she can prove any of that substantively,
[03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:48.640]  she gets $10,000. You can't do it, ma'am. I want you to do the research and find out

[03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:57.280]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my
[03:16:57.280 --> 03:17:02.640]  mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.640 --> 03:17:06.560]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems

[03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:03.200]  Introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate
[03:18:03.200 --> 03:18:09.600]  seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort,
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:16.000]  and respiratory function. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:21.680]  quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:26.640]  this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
[03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:31.760]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:36.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:41.360]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase which is
[03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:47.360]  an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy
[03:18:47.360 --> 03:18:54.000]  the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[03:19:57.680 --> 03:20:07.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:07.680 --> 03:20:24.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:38.560]  It's an opportunity for striving low-income Americans not to compete with those low-income Americans.
[03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:44.560]  Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today while
[03:20:45.280 --> 03:20:52.720]  ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow.
[03:20:52.720 --> 03:21:01.760]  And we want immigrants coming in. We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country.
[03:21:03.040 --> 03:21:08.880]  But a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill.
[03:21:10.320 --> 03:21:14.800]  All right, folks. We've got the full speech. Owen Schreuer in the next hour is going to be
[03:21:14.800 --> 03:21:19.440]  playing it when he takes over in the war room. We've got Matt Bracken about the takeover. I want
[03:21:19.440 --> 03:21:22.800]  to try to get as many of your calls as possible. And I apologize. I can't get to all of them.
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:27.440]  We really respect all your calls. And I have to stop now and just say this.
[03:21:28.560 --> 03:21:32.400]  I didn't plug any last hour things that fund us. And I'm not complaining.
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:38.000]  I'm just saying if people don't financially buy our products, we won't be here.
[03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:42.960]  And a subconscious part of me sometimes I think kind of hopes that because I'm not going to give
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:49.760]  in, I'm not going to give up, but I could give out. And I'm just very, very thankful to the listeners
[03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:54.160]  for all your support over the years. And you just don't know how important you are
[03:21:54.960 --> 03:21:59.680]  literally. And I don't want to say I'm guilty always asking for support. I just know I sound
[03:21:59.680 --> 03:22:04.640]  like a baby bird squawking sometimes saying feed me, Seymour. But these are products you
[03:22:04.640 --> 03:22:09.200]  need anyway. So thank you all. A bunch of big specials are about to end at m4store.com. And
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:15.760]  I'll just leave it at that. And you know, I'm just mad at the enemy that they're so damn evil.
[03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:20.400]  Because I've said this a lot. And I'll say it again, man, if they were like Boss Hog or something,
[03:22:20.960 --> 03:22:25.840]  and just wanted to run stuff, I didn't want to sexualize kids and didn't want to kill
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:31.840]  already born babies and stuff. I wouldn't be fighting this hard. And again, I don't feel
[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:39.840]  sorry for myself, but I don't want to even say I'm exhausted. I'm like a ringwraith now or something.
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:48.800]  I'm only alive when I'm fighting and thinking about this. It's all I do now. I have dreams
[03:22:48.800 --> 03:22:54.080]  about it. When I'm on the crapper, I'm thinking about it when I'm walking down the street. I mean,
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:23:00.080]  I just remember when I used to go fishing and hiking and I even 10 years ago, five years ago,
[03:23:00.080 --> 03:23:04.720]  and I'm not complaining. I'm just gone, folks. I'm gone. In fact, there's no turning back.
[03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:12.080]  It's all over for me. I mean, I'm just I'm gone, folks. 25 years doing this and there's nothing
[03:23:12.080 --> 03:23:23.920]  left. There's nothing left except war. And that's it. By the way, I'm fulfilled. I feel stronger
[03:23:23.920 --> 03:23:31.520]  than I never felt. But I'm not the same person I used to be. I used to be a funny guy. I used to have
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:37.680]  fun. And now it's just the globalists have really robbed us of our innocence, haven't they? They've
[03:23:37.680 --> 03:23:46.240]  robbed us of being able just to be normal and just live our lives. But I just don't know what
[03:23:46.240 --> 03:23:51.120]  they're going to do next. They're so damn evil. And I just study them all day long. They're just
[03:23:51.120 --> 03:23:56.640]  they just come. They're just they're a bunch of trash and they're so hateful and they're such
[03:23:56.640 --> 03:24:02.960]  liars and they're funded by the biggest mass murderers and they're just so bad. And you know,
[03:24:02.960 --> 03:24:13.520]  in the final equation, they do it because they're weak. And that's really what evil is is people
[03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:22.400]  just giving another weakness. And I just can't believe our country has turned into this.
[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:31.680]  And I don't like the avenues my brains from going down either. I just know this.
[03:24:31.680 --> 03:24:44.560]  They will lose. The question is, how bad is it going to get before we turn it around?
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:50.160]  All right, Lander in Oregon, you're a real trooper. You win the blue ribbon for holding so long.
[03:24:51.680 --> 03:24:54.160]  Thank you for calling. What's on your mind? What's the President Trump do?
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:25:00.720]  Well, I liked your four pillar plan. But I think that right now we it's it's just like you're
[03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:06.080]  saying we're not in Kansas anymore. And as a fourth dimensional war, a fourth generation war,
[03:25:06.080 --> 03:25:13.840]  we need our comms or free speech as our number one element. And most people in what's going to
[03:25:13.840 --> 03:25:20.080]  happen aren't even going to be able to judge what's real and what's not real anymore. That's why
[03:25:20.080 --> 03:25:25.040]  having you here on the air talking about this stuff is so important. Well, you said it, the
[03:25:25.040 --> 03:25:30.800]  globalists admit, and in 1984, they talk about this, that they're removing all the basic pillars
[03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:34.800]  of common sense of reality. And for people that live with some pillars of reality, we can still
[03:25:34.800 --> 03:25:39.040]  navigate it. But for some people that grow up without the pillars, they don't even know where
[03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:46.000]  they are. Yeah, it's really scary, man. So where do you at a gut level think this is going?
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:56.960]  Well, what you were talking about earlier about sort of misinformation about events
[03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:06.160]  between patriots and people wearing masks, I think we need to be able to not just understand
[03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:12.400]  false flags, but understand how lots of these people might be controlled using our modern
[03:26:12.400 --> 03:26:17.840]  technology. Because our modern technology isn't just about RF controls, it's about controlling
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:24.160]  the cybernetic inputs into different people's systems. And we have to get people aware that
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:28.080]  basically when they're using these big tech platforms, they are
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:36.160]  seeding a sort of personal control that I think most people don't think of the technology.
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:39.600]  And by the way, that's what all the heads of Facebook admit. There's top psychologist,
[03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:44.880]  psychiatrist, with real time inputs studying what works and what doesn't to mesmerize the
[03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:49.040]  weakest people into a highly suggestible state. And once they have you in that state, they can
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:54.960]  actually program you through these systems, not just the flicker rate, but the social conditioning
[03:26:54.960 --> 03:26:59.680]  that goes through it. And so yes, these are the greatest mind control devices the world has ever
[03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:05.200]  seen designed to exploit psychological vulnerability. So we wonder why the modern leftist looks like
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:11.280]  a dead zombie. It's because they're sleepwalking. And in many cases, medically are in a trance.
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:18.720]  They're under a spell. Wow. You know, being here in Portland, I see that stuff. It's real, man.
[03:27:19.760 --> 03:27:22.480]  What is it like? I mean, what's happened to them? Because they all have like a demonic
[03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:29.040]  look on their eye and they all kind of walk like zombies. Yeah. Lots of blank stares. I mean,
[03:27:29.040 --> 03:27:33.920]  lots. It's in the kind of lower class neighborhood where I work, you know,
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:37.760]  usually once or twice a day, there'll be someone running around screaming, convulsing,
[03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:46.080]  you know, feces all over the streets. It's, it's, it's a mess out here, man. Most people, I totally
[03:27:46.080 --> 03:27:53.040]  not awake in terms of what they walk around their daily lives. This is the screen sickness.
[03:27:54.080 --> 03:27:57.680]  It's screen sickness. And then they've been programmed by the lowest common denominator.
[03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:03.760]  And then now they're animal brain, their reptile brain is in control. And it's here,
[03:28:03.760 --> 03:28:07.680]  we wonder what the apocalypse, what the, what it looks like. I mean, this is the death
[03:28:07.680 --> 03:28:11.440]  of humanity. Powerful call, Lander. Thanks for holding for so long. Glad you got in.
[03:28:11.440 --> 03:28:19.040]  All right. I apologize to everybody else. Tiger Woods on turbo force. Well, I don't want to hear
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:25.280]  that call. And I want to hear Matt Braggen. And Matt knows sometimes I'm going to preempt him.
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:30.560]  He does a great job co-hosting, but I got, we'll go to Matt Braggen. But I got to hear from Casey
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:37.360]  in female region too about Tiger Woods on turbo force. Look, I've been told by folks that play
[03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:41.200]  golf with him. He's a lister for years. I know he's buddies with Trump, but I just,
[03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:45.760]  did he just come back from nowhere with turbo force? That's an endorsement I would definitely
[03:28:45.760 --> 03:28:51.360]  need. That can save the show right there. I want to hear about this and Matt Braggen takes it over.
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:56.320]  Faith Goldy might be popping in. Okay. So a watch is good and some jewelry. Better grab some flowers
[03:28:56.320 --> 03:29:00.560]  too. Hey, what you doing? Mother's Day. Remember? Oh yeah. So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip

[03:30:54.160 --> 03:31:00.800]  Stacy in a great state of Texas. In FEMA region six, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[03:31:00.800 --> 03:31:04.480]  Good to talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know
[03:31:04.480 --> 03:31:08.400]  that I don't normally take vitamins at all. I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:31:08.400 --> 03:31:13.280]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[03:31:13.280 --> 03:31:16.880]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins, they don't have things that they say
[03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:20.000]  that they have in them and they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:22.240]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[03:31:22.240 --> 03:31:25.680]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good. It
[03:31:25.680 --> 03:31:29.760]  doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and you know,
[03:31:29.760 --> 03:31:32.880]  it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day. So I really like it.
[03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:36.640]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are, they're known to turbo
[03:31:36.640 --> 03:31:42.000]  charge women and then we get the organic ones and put it in it. So yeah, stamina, libido,
[03:31:42.000 --> 03:31:46.880]  energy, these are amazing things and ultimate female force. So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:31:46.880 --> 03:32:10.320]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight to five, three, three, one, three, nine. What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history. This is a digital AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones or info wars.com.
[03:32:10.320 --> 03:32:25.120]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels. Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[03:32:25.120 --> 03:32:32.400]  They saw info wars as a dominant, independent, anti war pro human, pro sovereign, pro family,
[03:32:32.400 --> 03:32:42.400]  populist organization. So they thought first they come for Alex Jones. Then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:32:42.400 --> 03:33:03.400]  The way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech. Understand that they believe they can take us down. They'll take everybody else down.
[03:33:03.400 --> 03:33:25.400]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Yeah, and Matt Braga is coming up right now. You've got something for me. By the way, I've been going over Trump's presidential plan. It's up on info wars.com.
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:39.400]  It's a point based system. And it makes a lot of sense and a lot of European countries use it. And so they're gonna trouble calling it evil. Problem is they're just going to override that with a bunch of refugees and call it refugees like the EU's done.
[03:33:39.400 --> 03:33:57.400]  So continue to track that as it unfolds. But I got to go to this caller. I apologize to the others. Casey, I'm sure it's wishful thinking. You're saying Tiger comes back from nowhere. Is he on turbo force? Just an amazing pre workout and long term energy system. Unlike any other or I mean, Tiger Woods isn't actually taking
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:13.400]  turbo force, is he? That's a good idea though. I was trying to send him some. I'm not entirely sure. But when I was watching the masters, he was drinking a bottle of pole in spring that was pink. Who knows? I sure love turbo force, my friend.
[03:34:13.400 --> 03:34:29.400]  Excuse me? I said, I sure love turbo force. Yeah, I know. Well, check it out. I mean, you can go on YouTube because they showed him a lot, you know, when he was just standing around because he's a big story, you know, he's Tiger Woods. And every once in a while, he'd be sucking on that bottle of pole with spring and it was pink.
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:33.400]  And I don't know anybody else makes an energy drink that's pink.
[03:34:33.400 --> 03:34:46.400]  I'll have to try to find out. I know I've been told by multiple folks that are friends with him. He's a listener, but I don't really worry about stuff like that. But that's a great point. I was told like eight years ago as a listener, I was told like earlier this year, some folks that are friends with him, oh, you know, Tiger likes your show.
[03:34:46.400 --> 03:35:02.400]  So that's great. Who knows? He might be on, he might be on turbo force. Who knows? Well, last year when he won his first tournament in a long time, they tried to grill him on like, you know, degrading the president in some way. You know, this is what you need in a press conference after a golf tournament, right? And he wouldn't do it.
[03:35:02.400 --> 03:35:06.400]  I know he's friends with Trump. He's been friends with Trump like 20 years.
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:14.400]  Yeah, exactly. You know, and he wouldn't like both president. No, I don't forget it. The media wasn't even talking about his when they were talking about his politics.
[03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:23.400]  So your other point, Casey, times we're living in times we're living in. Oh, that's an interesting question. This is the beginning of the printing press, the internet.
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:27.400]  I mean, this is the second wave of the information revolution.
[03:35:27.400 --> 03:35:33.400]  Once we had the printing press, now everyone can have a Bible. Everyone can have a book. Everyone could read for themselves.
[03:35:33.400 --> 03:35:46.400]  They weren't being told by other people what everything was. And this led to the industrial revolution, the information revolution, all the revolutions that we had from the 14th century through today.
[03:35:46.400 --> 03:36:00.400]  Now the internet is the next level, because now with the electronic media taking over, now the internet is the electronic media for everyone. It's basically it's the printing press for electronic media, and they're trying to stop it.
[03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:11.400]  You know, you being cut off is burning books or records for that matter. That's my opinion on it. And I don't, do I know what to do about it? I think we just have to fight away through it.
[03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:16.400]  You know, Gavin McGinnis suing SPLC is a start, you know.
[03:36:16.400 --> 03:36:24.400]  Let me tell you, I'm trying to develop the money to do that, so it can be done right, because you can get lawyers to do it quote for free.
[03:36:24.400 --> 03:36:33.400]  But then when it gets down to depositions and all the rest of it, it doesn't happen. We have got the PIs that will work at cost, licensed all over the country.
[03:36:33.400 --> 03:36:41.400]  We've got the helicopter pilots. We've got, I mean, we're not just going to play games with these groups. We're going to come after them legally and lawfully.
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:48.400]  It just, I haven't pulled the trigger on a few different plans yet, because, you know, I saved up some money over the years and I've spent most of that.
[03:36:48.400 --> 03:36:56.400]  I always wanted to have a backup, because I knew this was coming. So it really does come down to the listeners. Whatever you do supporting us, you're going to see some fireworks one way or the other.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:36:57.400]  Thank you, Casey.
[03:36:57.400 --> 03:37:07.400]  All right, Matt Bracken takes over. Appreciate him letting me pre-empt some here we got behind today. Matt Bracken, enemiesfarmdomestic.com, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism specialist, give us this take on the waterfront.
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:10.400]  Thanks, Matt.
[03:37:10.400 --> 03:37:18.400]  Thanks, Alex. Yeah, I was trying to set up a conference call or a call in with Faith Goldie for this hour, but she's busy.
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:28.400]  It didn't work out, but it'd be great to have her on as soon as possible, because I saw, there's a lot coming out of Canada right now.
[03:37:28.400 --> 03:37:46.400]  There's a little troika of globalist communists that the Christchurch shooting, the mosque massacres, boosted the status of the socialist, globalist prime minister of New Zealand, whose name is Jacinda Ardern.
[03:37:46.400 --> 03:38:04.400]  And when the mosque shooting happened, even though it's ironic that it was live streamed on Facebook, and so it really could be almost called the Facebook massacre, because that was the vehicle that was used to spread the images live globally.
[03:38:04.400 --> 03:38:16.400]  But when this happened, New Zealand, which doesn't have a First or Second Amendment, they've gone really whole hog both against free speech and against gun rights.
[03:38:16.400 --> 03:38:21.400]  Now they're sending armed cops to people's houses over social media posts.
[03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:38.400]  And after the mosque massacres, the shooter had put a manifesto up on the internet, and very quickly New Zealand made it a felony to even try to link to this thing or to the Facebook videos.
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:48.400]  And what's coming now, they're benefiting from this in terms of using it for a crackdown on conservative social media.
[03:38:48.400 --> 03:39:07.400]  These three in this troika, which is Justin Trudeau of Canada, Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, and Emmanuel Macron, they and other invited leaders are having a meeting in Paris next week called the Christchurch call.
[03:39:07.400 --> 03:39:18.400]  Now, they're not talking about Sri Lanka, Islamic massacres, anything like that. This is going to be focused on conservatives and getting us off of the internet.
[03:39:18.400 --> 03:39:28.400]  And they're going to use the Christchurch model where they can just make internet addresses basically illegal.
[03:39:28.400 --> 03:39:38.400]  Anybody going to them is going to be flagged for further social media censorship. Certain IPs are just going to be banned and deleted.
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:54.400]  So this, in a sense, is really becoming a battle between, I think, President Trump and those who want more freedom on the internet and the globalist, socialist communists who want less freedom on the internet.
[03:39:54.400 --> 03:40:06.400]  So when Obama, this is a caller, one or two calls ago made this point, Obama gave away control of the internet seems like a minor thing, but it was really important.
[03:40:06.400 --> 03:40:15.400]  America used to control the internet and we don't anymore. So a battle is lining up because it won't matter if we have free speech in the United States.
[03:40:15.400 --> 03:40:37.400]  If certain internet addresses are just banned or deleted or flagged for further social media censorship across this increasingly hostile social credit system that we have where you can be taken off of Patreon, PayPal, even credit cards.
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:48.400]  And this is all coming and certain social media sites are going away like the WordPress site Chateau de Hartiste. It's been up for years.
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:56.400]  It's been attacked, I think, by the Southern Poverty Law Center, like Gavin McGinnis was talking about, and it's gone.
[03:40:56.400 --> 03:41:11.400]  So while I've got a moment, I'd like to mention I do have a new book out and it's stuff that's probably going to be gone from the internet. If these communists have their way, it's called the Bracken Collection.
[03:41:11.400 --> 03:41:28.400]  And if you get it in hard copy, it won't be deleteable. It's also going to be on Kindle. You can pre-order it. But all of these questionable, shaky, right-wing, alt-right sites, there's a real battle going on now.
[03:41:28.400 --> 03:41:39.400]  And the rest of the globalist world is going to try to take it down. It's sort of America versus the world because we're the only holdout with a true First Amendment.
[03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:53.400]  The rest of the world and the tech giants, like Facebook, Facebook and Google are happy to work with the communist Chinese to work with Emmanuel Macron and Trudeau and all of these globalists.
[03:41:53.400 --> 03:42:04.400]  They have no problem with stripping us of our free speech rights. So you've only got conservatives in America standing up for the First Amendment.
[03:42:04.400 --> 03:42:19.400]  You've got the Democratic socialists of America. They don't want the First Amendment. If Trump loses, forget it. And you've got the tech giants that may be American, but their loyalty is purely globalist.
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:38.400]  So we need to stand up and make this a real fight and support President Trump and encourage him to go to war for free speech on the Internet. Apparently there's going to be some kind of a blog entry where you can report censorship.
[03:42:38.400 --> 03:42:52.400]  And that's good, but we need to push that as strongly as possible because with 2020 coming, forget the Russians. Just imagine the power of big social media to twist and suppress conservatism.
[03:43:09.400 --> 03:43:21.400]  We're at infowars.com. We're at newswars.com. Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news. We have our own videos. We have our own articles. We're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, infowars is still chatting along.
[03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:23.400]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news. Today.
[03:43:23.400 --> 03:43:45.400]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com. We knew this censorship was coming forever. We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.

[03:44:15.400 --> 03:44:24.400]  I told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick, but then you add not just the fact this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.

[03:45:17.400 --> 03:45:18.400]  God bless you, brother.
[03:45:18.400 --> 03:45:25.400]  I have three or four infowars bumper stickers in my glove box right now. I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:54.400]  You're our only hope, brother. I'm telling you, you're more important than I am. It's people like you on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground.
[03:45:54.400 --> 03:46:00.400]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas. Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.

[03:46:26.400 --> 03:46:32.400]  And we decided I liked Secret 12 Plus, but they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[03:46:32.400 --> 03:46:37.400]  Just call it Ultra 12. Well, you know what? I don't like how the label's printed, and it just so happens it already been labeled with the other one.
[03:46:37.400 --> 03:46:44.400]  We decided to change the name, so when you peel off the label, underneath it, it's Secret 12 Plus.
[03:46:44.400 --> 03:46:52.400]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now. Better than Secret 12 ever was. Infowarsstore.com now back in stock at four months sold out.
[03:47:14.400 --> 03:47:26.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:33.400]  I'd like to continue with what I was talking about in the last segment.
[03:47:33.400 --> 03:47:41.400]  And while I'm thinking about it, flag this or go on YouTube for as long as she's still on there.
[03:47:41.400 --> 03:47:48.400]  She gets banned once in a while, comes back with a new channel. On YouTube, she's Faith J. Goldie now.
[03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:55.400]  And her new video is called What the Elites Are Preparing For, or What Are the Elites Preparing For.
[03:47:55.400 --> 03:48:02.400]  And it's amazing how this is getting absolutely no coverage in the United States, which I think is intentional.
[03:48:02.400 --> 03:48:12.400]  Trump was not invited to this conference. This is a censorship conference. This is a globalist, socialist censorship conference.
[03:48:12.400 --> 03:48:22.400]  And what's on the table is not Islamic terror. It's suppressing conservative thought, the so-called alt-right.
[03:48:22.400 --> 03:48:37.400]  And they're going to have a very receptive audience with the big tech CEOs who are going to help as much as they can to take away our freedom of speech.
[03:48:37.400 --> 03:48:47.400]  We remember a couple of years ago, there was an open mic moment where Angela Merkel was caught discussing with Mark Zuckerberg how they would like to cooperate,
[03:48:47.400 --> 03:48:54.400]  to get rid of the so-called hate speech on the Internet. He'd do all that he could. And this is unfolding.
[03:48:54.400 --> 03:49:02.400]  So as much as we can, with what we can, we need to help push Trump, because there's not many people in our corner,
[03:49:02.400 --> 03:49:11.400]  help push Trump towards some kind of, I don't know if it's going to take executive action, trying to push a bill through Congress,
[03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:21.400]  is going to be futile at this point because the Democrats are running it. But we're going to find ourselves in a very small and diminishing echo chamber
[03:49:21.400 --> 03:49:33.400]  where conservatives will only be allowed to broadcast within the United States. Our websites and blogs will virtually be banned outside of the United States
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:42.400]  where there is no First Amendment. So this is serious because you'll say, well, I still have my Internet, but your reach, your volume,
[03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:50.400]  is going to be progressively just turned down and down and down. And with an election coming up, I mean, it cracks me up.
[03:49:50.400 --> 03:49:58.400]  I think the Russians spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on disruptive Facebook ads, and really for both sides.
[03:49:58.400 --> 03:50:08.400]  And that was supposed to be some huge thing, but just imagine the power of Google, Facebook, and Twitter to tilt the playing field with their algorithms,
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:18.400]  to boost leftist websites and leftist commentators, and to silence conservatives, you know, infowars, people like ourselves.
[03:50:18.400 --> 03:50:24.400]  So it's not enough just to say, hey, I'm still on Facebook. I'm still on Twitter. Life is good. Right.
[03:50:24.400 --> 03:50:33.400]  But if your volume is being turned down to 0.5 and the Southern Poverty Law Center's volume is turned up to 20, well, that has an effect.
[03:50:33.400 --> 03:50:44.400]  One of the previous callers mentioned how there is a screen sickness and millennials and even Gen Xers, you don't, anybody, myself, you,
[03:50:44.400 --> 03:50:50.400]  you don't realize it, but you think, yeah, I have free choice. I go on the Internet and I can choose one, two, three, four, five.
[03:50:50.400 --> 03:50:54.400]  But what you don't realize is one, two, three, four, five, we're all chosen for you.
[03:50:54.400 --> 03:51:07.400]  You know, it wasn't a free search result. It was the search results that were put to you by left-wing social justice warriors that work for big tech.
[03:51:07.400 --> 03:51:18.400]  So we're progressively being brainwashed without really even knowing it, just by thinking, you know, I can go and see whatever I want on the Internet.
[03:51:18.400 --> 03:51:23.400]  But the first choices that come up are the choices that they want you to see.
[03:51:23.400 --> 03:51:31.400]  Now, I'd like to switch while I have time slightly. The Iran war drums are certainly beating.
[03:51:31.400 --> 03:51:35.400]  And you have to wonder, you know, why is this happening right now?
[03:51:35.400 --> 03:51:47.400]  Is there truly some intel out there that's so important that Trump feels like he's got to move aircraft carriers and our 70-year-old B-52 fleet?
[03:51:47.400 --> 03:52:01.400]  Perhaps there is. Now, a problem with having politicized intel agencies, a really big problem, is this the boy who cried wolf paradigm,
[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:12.400]  which is an ancient saying that, you know, has a lot of meaning when intel agencies aren't calling balls and strikes when they're slanted politically.
[03:52:12.400 --> 03:52:23.400]  And Brennan was part of this whole Iraq WMD hoax, you know, which was used to drag us into the first Iraq war.
[03:52:23.400 --> 03:52:31.400]  When Americans now distrust the intel agencies and our first reaction, for all we know, there really is.
[03:52:31.400 --> 03:52:36.400]  You know, Iran could be preparing nukes on missiles. And who would believe it?
[03:52:36.400 --> 03:52:43.400]  After what happened with the Iraq WMD story, who would ever believe the intel agencies now?
[03:52:43.400 --> 03:52:55.400]  They've burned their credibility. And that's one of the worst consequences of, you know, having politicized lying intel agencies.
[03:52:55.400 --> 03:53:04.400]  It's the boy who cried wolf. Even if there's a real reason to go to war with Iran and I pray to God there's not and that we don't, nobody's going to believe it.
[03:53:04.400 --> 03:53:13.400]  And this is really, you know, when you consider that Brennan and Comey were communists, are communists, they're just undercover about it.
[03:53:13.400 --> 03:53:21.400]  The best thing that they can do, working really in parallel with what Vladimir Putin would like to do.
[03:53:21.400 --> 03:53:29.400]  You know, Putin considers that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century.
[03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:38.400]  That's what Putin truly believes. And his primary enemy is and will be the United States of America.
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:45.400]  You know, a global hegemon with global reach, you know, power across the globe.
[03:53:45.400 --> 03:53:57.400]  If he can trick us or drag us along with people like Brennan into attacking Iran now, and we're tied down in a war that is worse than the Iraq war,
[03:53:57.400 --> 03:54:07.400]  worse than Afghanistan or Syria, you know, with global economic consequences, with the Straits of Hormuz closed with missiles and sea mines.
[03:54:07.400 --> 03:54:14.400]  Well, Russia has got its own energy supply. They would like to see nothing more.
[03:54:14.400 --> 03:54:21.400]  Putin and his old KGB buddies, they would like to see nothing more than America tearing itself to pieces,
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:29.400]  totally overextended, wrecking its military, using up its ordinance, and the West in an economic catastrophe.
[03:54:29.400 --> 03:54:35.400]  So that's what I think is going on. I hope nothing like that happens.
[03:54:35.400 --> 03:54:42.400]  Now, as far as Lindsey Graham, he's now the darling of the conservatives ever since he stood up for Kavanaugh.
[03:54:42.400 --> 03:54:54.400]  So he's gained a lot of political capital in the last, say, six months. But Lindsey Graham didn't get the nickname Lindsey Grahamnesty for no reason.
[03:54:54.400 --> 03:55:10.400]  So when we see Trump's proposals on the border, you can just bet we're going to get shafted again with another big omnibus amnesty that will promise more border protection
[03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:19.400]  that we'll never really get. So the border fence creeps along while we're having a mass invasion, a demographic invasion,
[03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:30.400]  which the Democrats love because they see every one of these, you know, Guatemalan and El Salvadoran kids as a future dreamer, a future Democrat voter.
[03:55:30.400 --> 03:55:38.400]  You know, they come over at age seven or 13. Imagine how many elections they'll be voting in and they're going to be voting for welfare.
[03:55:38.400 --> 03:55:44.400]  They're going to be voting for free medical. They're going to be voting for free education. That means they're going to be voting Democrat.
[03:55:44.400 --> 03:55:53.400]  So there's no way that the Democrats in Congress are going to approve any bill that comes out of a Lindsey Graham or Donald Trump.
[03:55:53.400 --> 03:56:01.400]  And what Donald Trump needs to do is use his authority as the commander in chief to put military forces on the border.
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:10.400]  I've said it over and over again, three strand and then six strand concertina from coast to coast backed up with military ready to fire tear gas.
[03:56:10.400 --> 03:56:23.400]  You don't have to wait until a hundred or a thousand people are rushing the border. You can loudspeaker them and gas them with with tear gas, pepper spray in Mexico.
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:32.400]  What country just allows itself to be overrun? That's why they call that the GOP, the stupid party and the Democrats, the evil party.
[03:56:32.400 --> 03:56:39.400]  The Democrats know what they're doing. This is the great replacement. This is a demographic replacement.
[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:51.400]  They are bringing in future Democrat welfare voters and the Republicans, even Trump, are too timid and politically correct to call it out as what's happening,
[03:56:51.400 --> 03:56:56.400]  which is a a planned calculated demographic invasion.
[03:56:56.400 --> 03:57:10.400]  The American Democrat globalists and the George Soros globalists are working hand in glove to bum rush our country with millions of new future Democrat welfare voters.
[03:57:10.400 --> 03:57:17.400]  That's what's going on and Trump can stop it, but he needs to take the gloves off and say the hell with Congress.
[03:57:17.400 --> 03:57:26.400]  I can do this as commander in chief. Protecting the border from invasion is right in the Constitution. He needs to just do it.
[03:57:26.400 --> 03:57:31.400]  Anyway, I'll be back next week and we'll see what's going on.
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:39.400]  But follow what's happening in Paris with this this social media censorship conference because it's going to have consequences here.
[03:57:39.400 --> 03:57:43.400]  And so this is Matt Bracken and I'm signing off.
[03:57:43.400 --> 03:57:50.400]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:57:50.400 --> 03:57:57.400]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:57:57.400 --> 03:58:02.400]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:58:02.400 --> 03:58:08.400]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:58:08.400 --> 03:58:13.400]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
