[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:34.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.120 --> 00:39.800]  welcome my friends welcome it is the third day of December Friday the third
[00:39.800 --> 00:43.520]  day of December 2010 we're going to be live here for at least the next three
[00:43.520 --> 00:49.600]  hours today coming up in about 30 minutes I am going to have an update up
[00:49.600 --> 00:59.280]  at info wars.com with some really serious breaking news and I'm just going
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.520]  to wait until 11 30 coming up in 30 minutes to go over this the headline at
[01:05.520 --> 01:11.640]  info wars.com right now is police state episode of hit Ventura show covering
[01:11.640 --> 01:17.880]  FEMA camps pulled from air now I noticed this three weeks ago and I've been
[01:17.880 --> 01:21.960]  so busy that I didn't really talk to the network about it until about a week
[01:21.960 --> 01:26.280]  ago and then I talked to some more people from the network yesterday and I
[01:26.280 --> 01:30.880]  decided this morning why not just talk to Jesse Ventura directly and he's been
[01:30.880 --> 01:35.080]  busy and just noticed it in the last week that they did completely memory hole
[01:35.080 --> 01:38.920]  they normally air new episodes over and over again they're airing all the new
[01:38.920 --> 01:43.080]  episodes over and over again but the police state FEMA camp special that you
[01:43.080 --> 01:46.960]  know I consulted on and of course appeared in heavily in fact of any of
[01:46.960 --> 01:49.720]  the episodes I've been involved in this season or last season this is the big
[01:49.720 --> 01:58.040]  one I'm very proud of it I've said it's a first for national television and I
[01:58.040 --> 02:04.640]  can say well I'm going to wait till the bottom of the hour I called I talked to
[02:04.640 --> 02:11.240]  Ventura I wrote some notes about what I can and can't talk about because
[02:11.240 --> 02:15.440]  obviously when you're working with an organization and there's confidence
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.600]  involved I don't break confidence when someone puts me in that place but I
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.880]  knew that they wouldn't wait long to start saying something about this because
[02:25.880 --> 02:32.920]  these are people that like freedom I'll guarantee you Ventura does and so what
[02:32.920 --> 02:37.960]  I've got for you is pretty bombshell and Ventura is deciding right now what
[02:37.960 --> 02:43.880]  he's going to do about this but I will let you in on this information coming up
[02:43.880 --> 02:49.360]  at about t-minus 30 minutes well exactly 30 minutes from now at 33 after and
[02:49.360 --> 02:53.080]  we're three minutes into the broadcast right now I will get in to this
[02:53.080 --> 02:56.920]  information this deals with the freedom of the press it deals with behind the
[02:56.920 --> 03:02.520]  scenes media manipulation it deals with this whole Homeland Security
[03:02.520 --> 03:09.000]  apparatus it it's a lot bigger than just this TV show and FEMA camps the truth
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.960]  was told in that hour special the truth was told and people don't like it and
[03:15.960 --> 03:20.600]  I'll be surprised if they start rearing the JFK episode I from last week I
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.880]  noticed that that isn't scheduled before the new premiere tonight on water and if
[03:25.880 --> 03:30.040]  the system doesn't like the JFK or the police state episode they're really not
[03:30.040 --> 03:34.160]  gonna like what airs tonight I mean this is hard core that they're putting
[03:34.160 --> 03:39.000]  uranium in the water and it's confirmed it's funny that it's breaking in Texas
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.920]  newspapers and CBS News at the same time here in Texas but they spin it and go
[03:43.920 --> 03:48.760]  the government's covering up uranium that's not the story the fact is they're
[03:48.760 --> 03:56.000]  sticking it in there because it fries men's genitals du does the same thing to
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.280]  our troops haven't you figured it out I got the White House science our book over

[04:14.440 --> 04:18.760]  to come out swinging but I gotta sit here and wait for them to tell you the
[04:18.760 --> 04:24.920]  full deal and it's it's very hard to keep my mouth shut folks this stuff is real

[08:45.960 --> 08:50.440]  that is so staggering this a week after they announced they're dumping the dollar
[08:50.440 --> 08:54.560]  with the Russians and what have they chosen as their new real currency for
[08:54.560 --> 09:04.840]  international trade gold they're also going wild into silver Ron Paul says
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.120]  US counterfeit machine will lead to political social chaos what did the
[09:09.120 --> 09:12.040]  Pentagon say three years ago what did the British Ministry of Defense say three
[09:12.040 --> 09:17.080]  years ago that they're waiting and planning for this that's why they're
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.000]  censoring Jesse Ventura's police state FEMA camp special because it breaks down
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.200]  the entire control grid the spying system what's in the news today what I
[09:26.200 --> 09:30.640]  told you years ago the government is watching everything listening to you
[09:30.640 --> 09:35.480]  reading your emails tracking every purchase you make it's totally lawless
[09:35.480 --> 09:41.520]  it's completely illegal and they've been doing it in plain view now it's in the
[09:41.520 --> 09:45.920]  Wall Street Journal today now it's in Wired Magazine today and they talk about
[09:45.920 --> 09:49.720]  it like it's no big deal at TSA sticks their hands down your pants yeah the
[09:49.720 --> 09:53.360]  government spies on everything you do but it's secret where the 28 plus
[09:53.360 --> 09:56.480]  trillions gone to the Federal Reserve oh but we'll tell you about a trillion of
[09:56.480 --> 10:05.120]  it it's going to US media and to foreign banks I mean it is so criminal so
[10:05.120 --> 10:12.040]  illegitimate and the sky's the limit for these people oh there's no doubt we're
[10:12.040 --> 10:15.800]  going into a total depression there's no doubt the FEMA cancer there there's no
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.360]  doubt we are in so much trouble and we're in trouble because the average
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.160]  American I listened to him on talk radio the talk show host their childlike
[10:25.160 --> 10:31.160]  they are so trusting they they have no understanding of concepts or geopolitical
[10:31.160 --> 10:37.920]  movements or political systems they are helpless but it doesn't matter five
[10:37.920 --> 10:40.960]  percent of people weren't helpless against the corrupt British government
[10:40.960 --> 10:47.200]  that that look like angels compared to this one in 1776 five percent kicked
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.720]  their hind end because they were committed to fight them and never stop
[10:51.720 --> 10:58.080]  we got a lot more than 5% I said we got 15% that are hardcore and another 20% or
[10:58.080 --> 11:01.320]  so they're starting to wake up we are going to win this thing if the globalist
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.560]  can't play us off against each other okay I said I'd get to all the stacks the
[11:04.560 --> 11:10.160]  financial stack is totally insane with the food lines and the depression lines
[11:10.160 --> 11:18.000]  forming and with the real unemployment is more like 30% in California 23%
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.400]  nationwide growing we've got the new TSA information CNN reporter put on watch
[11:27.400 --> 11:31.840]  list of the criticizing TSA it's coming out that they are spying on people that
[11:31.840 --> 11:40.200]  criticize the TSA just total brazen authoritarian tyrannical bullies they're
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.000]  also announcing on television that yes the TSA is going to be in every town in
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.320]  the city confirming what we told you years ago with the local police they're
[11:51.320 --> 11:57.440]  now doing it from Florida to Texas to California New York Chicago literally
[11:57.440 --> 12:00.960]  putting the hands down the pants I've got the local newscast of them grabbing
[12:00.960 --> 12:08.080]  the genitals at bus stations and in oh my god it's just I can't believe it the
[12:08.080 --> 12:12.800]  boarders wide open of course I mean they are literally getting us ready to be
[12:12.800 --> 12:15.480]  rounded up and shipped off and they're getting the cops all trained for and I
[12:15.480 --> 12:20.200]  mean it's just so the bankers can rob everything I mean it's a nightmare it's
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.520]  totally illegitimate all people got to do is wake up and realize history but
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.840]  they won't they're still getting drunk every day watching their football games
[12:29.840 --> 12:35.240]  talking about silly stuff the average man acts like a 14-year-old boy people
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.200]  have arrested development and so we're gonna get hurt real bad you can be
[12:39.200 --> 12:46.440]  absolutely assured of that it's gonna get a lot worse for it gets better I've
[12:46.440 --> 12:53.960]  got all this TSA stuff I've got all the WikiLeaks news here's the Washington
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.880]  Post with a whitewash the Washington whitewash post government reports
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.120]  violation of limits on spying aimed at US citizens and then they just go on to
[13:05.120 --> 13:09.160]  admit that basically everything you do is completely surveilled of course that
[13:09.160 --> 13:13.760]  the Know Your Customer Act openly says the government has database connections
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.880]  directly to all your bank accounts and credit card transactions the credit card
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.160]  companies are paid money by the government to upkeep the the databases
[13:23.160 --> 13:29.760]  they know live time I mean six years ago I put it in Matrix of Evil the mainstream
[13:29.760 --> 13:35.320]  news articles where the governor was talking out of school in Wisconsin and
[13:35.320 --> 13:39.120]  told the Green Bay newspaper that oh look at my threat fusion center we
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.920]  can just dial in your name or social security or driver's license and focus
[13:42.920 --> 13:46.600]  on where you are via your cell phone at any time and you know we've got license
[13:46.600 --> 13:49.680]  plate reading cameras and back then I'd talk about it and get laughed at now

[13:52.880 --> 13:59.000]  scanners total control but the borders wide open government reports violations
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.160]  of limits on spying aimed at US citizens here's wired magazine feds
[14:03.160 --> 14:11.240]  warrantlessly tracking American's credit cards in real-time this was all public
[14:12.040 --> 14:21.160]  in 1996 it was all in the Telecommunications Act and it goes over
[14:21.160 --> 14:28.960]  the the the store loyalty cards the store gives you discounts on the products
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.320]  to create algorithms and figure out what you'll buy at any price to raise
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.920]  prices on key items and rip you off that's admitted but also they're paid by
[14:37.920 --> 14:42.840]  the government in real time to deliver the government every day what you buy
[14:42.840 --> 14:51.400]  it's totally criminal it's totally illegal they just do it all this RFID and
[14:51.400 --> 14:55.480]  products and cars they admit going back a decade ago San Francisco Chronicle
[14:55.480 --> 15:01.200]  they've got radio readers up all over the country tracking in real time and
[15:01.200 --> 15:04.400]  they're now announcing all this to cause a chilling effect to break your will
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.640]  yeah we spy on everything you do worse than 1984 yeah we stick our hands down
[15:08.640 --> 15:12.360]  your pants yeah we got 800 cities that are sanctuary cities and the illegals

[15:20.920 --> 15:24.520]  mainstream media is paid off by the government yeah we're stealing everything
[15:24.520 --> 15:30.080]  yeah we're taking the veterans benefits what's you gonna do about it we got
[15:30.080 --> 15:33.760]  SWAT team guys who think they're warriors who think the American people of
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.600]  their enemy trained to kill you we're foreign bankers we're criminals ha ha ha
[15:38.600 --> 15:42.560]  these cops like their uniforms they like their power they're gonna do whatever we
[15:42.560 --> 15:49.880]  want and if you smart off we're gonna taser you I mean it's it's brazen this
[15:49.880 --> 15:55.760]  country is becoming like Romania under Cheshire they've built the grid bigger
[15:55.760 --> 16:00.280]  than anything anybody's ever created and they're lined up with all this stuff
[16:00.280 --> 16:03.480]  tracking everybody and now they're going yeah we're gonna start censoring
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.760]  yeah we want to start arresting people for their speech what else science are
[16:07.760 --> 16:13.560]  yes Sunstein and others have said and now they come to the point of saying oh
[16:13.560 --> 16:16.760]  you think you're gonna peacefully take the country back through the states and
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.280]  the legislators in the Congress you think you're the people and this is of
[16:20.280 --> 16:22.960]  the people for people by the people and you're gonna do what the founders said
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.040]  and that what's totally legitimate we're gonna stage terror attacks we're gonna
[16:27.040 --> 16:30.680]  come after the American people we're gonna start wars with you we're not
[16:30.680 --> 16:34.840]  gonna let you peacefully take things back we're gonna rape you we're gonna
[16:34.840 --> 16:40.640]  steal everything you got because they know the average American is literally
[16:40.640 --> 16:44.800]  in a trance you try to talk to adults out there major scientific studies it's
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.640]  on record that most adults have lower brainwaves than people just 20 years
[16:48.640 --> 16:54.800]  ago they are in a sleep state you talk about glazed eyes the general public is
[16:54.800 --> 17:00.280]  literally asleep because when you watch just a few minutes of television the
[17:00.280 --> 17:04.080]  first time it takes an hour or more the studies show that once you learn to have
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.080]  suspend disbelief when your eyes glaze over your mouth hangs open you start
[17:08.080 --> 17:14.920]  drooling once you get mesmerized your brainwaves lower to a sleep walking
[17:14.920 --> 17:21.080]  state between waking and sleep totally suggestible folks your neighbors are
[17:21.080 --> 17:28.680]  literally zombies now they are literally biological androids do you
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.200]  understand that that's why you can't get through to them and they've put
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.800]  chemicals in the water that accentuate that on record and zombies listening

[24:45.680 --> 24:51.960]  breed them for the more docile the more passive until today you look at a wild

[26:19.760 --> 26:24.280]  going to be buying it in gold ladies and gentlemen because worldwide across the
[26:24.280 --> 26:30.520]  board fiat currencies are being devalued what a Napoleon Bonaparte say
[26:30.520 --> 26:33.880]  about private banks running a nation when a government is dependent upon
[26:33.880 --> 26:38.960]  banks for money and bankers for money they and not the leaders of the
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.480]  government control the situation since the hand that gives is above the hand
[26:43.480 --> 26:48.920]  that takes money has no motherland financiers are without patriotism and
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.400]  without decency their sole object is gain Napoleon Bonaparte what did Lord
[26:54.400 --> 26:59.600]  Acton say around the same period the issue which has swept down the centuries
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.880]  and notice centuries later we're still facing it the issue which has swept
[27:03.880 --> 27:08.960]  down the centuries and which will have to be fought sooner or later is the
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.280]  people versus the banks and what did George Washington fight what did Andrew
[27:14.280 --> 27:18.440]  Jackson fight this same issue what did Lincoln deal with what did Kennedy get
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.000]  killed for the bankers what Thomas Jefferson say if the people ever allow
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.760]  private banks to control the issuance of their currency first by inflation then
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.840]  by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will
[27:31.840 --> 27:35.800]  deprive the people of all their property until their children wake up
[27:35.800 --> 27:43.600]  homeless on the continent their fathers conquered Thomas Jefferson this was
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.040]  always the issue in our country it was always the number one election issue at
[27:48.040 --> 27:55.960]  the state level at the federal level from the 1770s right through until the
[27:55.960 --> 28:02.520]  1960s it was always the issue or one of the biggest issues it was a scandal
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.960]  decades after the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 that it came out in
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.600]  major newspapers that the richest families in the US had met three years
[28:12.600 --> 28:19.600]  before in 1910 at Jekyll Island Georgia to secretly and this has now all been
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.800]  released come out in their newspapers they owned they didn't own them all at
[28:23.800 --> 28:27.360]  the time but most of them and say they were against the Federal Reserve Act
[28:27.360 --> 28:31.560]  oh don't get us no oh please don't throw me in the briar patch when that's
[28:31.560 --> 28:38.800]  exactly where they wanted to be thrown now arrogantly two weeks ago at the
[28:38.800 --> 28:43.560]  hundred year anniversary of this conspiracy to take over the financial
[28:43.560 --> 28:46.720]  system in the US and control the issuance of currency and credit and
[28:46.720 --> 28:53.200]  hence take over the US and use that as a base for the planet they had a
[28:53.200 --> 28:57.840]  celebration at Jekyll Island with Bernackie and all the rest of the scum
[28:57.840 --> 29:06.360]  and the elite families and Greenspan and now it comes out that 20 and we

[35:29.120 --> 35:38.360]  individual freedoms on every front they are moving now they are stealing tens of
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.960]  trillions a year they won't tell the Congress where it went when some of it
[35:41.960 --> 35:49.040]  comes out it's buying off media I mean that's a totally unfree society
[35:51.200 --> 35:57.080]  meanwhile people are fighting over Republican and Democrat Boehner is up
[35:57.080 --> 36:01.000]  there today putting out press releases the Republican leader probably going to
[36:01.000 --> 36:06.600]  be speaker reporting on oh unemployment went up to 9.8 oh my I mean
[36:06.600 --> 36:12.720]  Boehner knows full well it's above 22 they all just play along with it if a
[36:12.720 --> 36:17.120]  congressman isn't talking like Ron Paul about martial law world government
[36:17.120 --> 36:24.920]  dollar collapse they're bought and paid for and I want to see Rand Paul hit the
[36:24.920 --> 36:28.680]  ground running when he gets into the Senate
[36:30.920 --> 36:36.920]  we all by degree have been conditioned to accept more and more and more
[36:36.920 --> 36:44.360]  insanity and whereas I would read the blueprints over a decade ago and so your
[36:44.360 --> 36:48.480]  cable box has a microphone in it that they don't even tell you about they've
[36:48.480 --> 36:53.360]  got AI computers recording it and doing keyword data logs then Google comes out
[36:53.360 --> 36:58.680]  five years later admits they're using all of these devices and your computer to
[36:58.680 --> 37:02.240]  listen to you and watch you schools come out and say yeah we're watching your
[37:02.240 --> 37:07.520]  kids at home no judge no jury they come out today in the Wall Street Journal in
[37:07.520 --> 37:12.560]  the Washington Post and Wired magazine and say yeah the government's listening
[37:12.560 --> 37:16.360]  to everything you do they're watching all your transactions in
[37:16.360 --> 37:20.840]  lifetime just four years ago Bush was up there in press conferences going I
[37:20.840 --> 37:26.320]  promise yeah well we're not listening any of you without a warrant I yeah we're
[37:26.320 --> 37:30.640]  only listening to Alcada overseas yeah yeah then he got caught lying so
[37:30.640 --> 37:35.240]  Congress runs in and writes a retroactive law saying well if it's if it's
[37:35.240 --> 37:40.000]  if it's people of interest overseas to people in America we don't need warrants
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.840]  and then it turns out it's just complete lawlessness well we already knew that the
[37:45.840 --> 37:52.600]  telecommunications act of 96 gave nine billion dollars first it was six billion
[37:52.600 --> 37:59.080]  and three billion more to be technical and it was also authorized billions more
[37:59.080 --> 38:07.520]  each year to pay the telecoms to run the spying for the NSA and they've got
[38:07.520 --> 38:14.720]  what they call dark fiber at every major IT facility that is in assay period
[38:14.720 --> 38:19.760]  everything and everything you do is being listened to but don't let that
[38:19.760 --> 38:23.880]  intimidate you don't let that become some panopticon you know the French going
[38:23.880 --> 38:29.920]  back 300 years ago figured out how to build circular prisons that had a stone
[38:29.920 --> 38:36.560]  guard tower generally four stories high inside a four-story prison and all of
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.040]  the bars were open so they could watch you at all times and there were guards at
[38:41.040 --> 38:47.240]  every level of the tower that had catwalks going out so that you had the
[38:47.240 --> 38:52.680]  feeling of being watched all the time the French 300 years ago developed this
[38:52.680 --> 38:56.280]  system of total surveillance or the feeling that you're being surveilled
[38:56.280 --> 39:01.760]  good you're dirty criminals that shouldn't be listening to my phone you're a
[39:01.760 --> 39:05.360]  dirty government that makes everything it does secret see they get more secret
[39:05.360 --> 39:10.320]  as everything we do is wide open and every act of this is a felony but it
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.800]  doesn't intimidate me it doesn't scare me that they're corrupt and evil see a
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.240]  lot of folks are going from the process of denying all this exists to going yeah
[39:18.240 --> 39:24.480]  I know it's all real so I'm just gonna go along with it if you give into this we
[39:24.480 --> 39:36.480]  know historically 100% 100% of the time we know where this goes downhill the more
[39:36.480 --> 39:41.440]  they get away with the more they're going to do and again comes out three
[39:41.440 --> 39:45.360]  months ago that all the major death benefits of six million dead and dying
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.600]  veterans from World War two through the current wars are having their death
[39:49.600 --> 39:53.880]  benefits when they die stolen from them and the government made a deal with the
[39:53.880 --> 39:59.280]  insurance companies to do it and nobody gets in trouble because the bureaucracy
[39:59.280 --> 40:07.680]  said Congress didn't pass a law legalizing theft the bureaucracy says so
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.440]  they say it's against the law for TSA to stick their hands down your pants but
[40:13.440 --> 40:22.120]  they say they're immune are you starting to figure out what these people are
[40:22.120 --> 40:26.760]  doing they are psychologically breaking our will they are training us to accept
[40:26.760 --> 40:34.560]  anything now not only did it come out in the last two days that hundreds of
[40:34.560 --> 40:38.920]  billions of dollars was given to foreign banks hundreds of billions was was
[40:38.920 --> 40:42.720]  given to foreign corporations and hundreds of billions were given to US
[40:42.720 --> 40:50.360]  corporations in the fortune 100 including MSNBC and other media outlets but the
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.440]  details of that remains secret and MSNBC violated tax laws by not reporting it
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.640]  but the government doesn't care if you violate laws as long as you're part of
[40:59.640 --> 41:05.520]  their criminal group we have a criminal government that is a sock puppet for
[41:05.520 --> 41:09.640]  offshore ruthless banks that Thomas Jefferson warned you about that Lord
[41:09.640 --> 41:17.880]  Acton warned you about and I read those quotes earlier and so of course the
[41:17.880 --> 41:20.600]  government's out in the open and Lieberman and Sunstein around the open and
[41:20.600 --> 41:23.920]  others are out in the open and Bill O'Reilly's out in the open saying
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.400]  censor people's free speech execute WikiLeaks regardless what you think of
[41:28.400 --> 41:35.040]  WikiLeaks if you execute or in or in prison him and it does look like a
[41:35.040 --> 41:41.200]  globalist destabilization program if you execute him for leaking this stuff to
[41:41.200 --> 41:46.360]  the media am I going to get executed for when law enforcement gave me the Mayak
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.320]  report and Homeland Security reports proving that veterans and gun owners of
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.040]  the number one enemy of the federal government and that that's who's really
[41:53.040 --> 41:59.280]  targeted not al-Qaeda al-CIAida will I be executed I mean if somebody gives a
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.120]  reporter some information will they be executed
[42:04.120 --> 42:23.040]  this is where we're going as a society and it's moving quicker once you get to
[42:23.040 --> 42:27.280]  this point in a tyranny then more tyranny happens in a year that happened
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.240]  in the previous decade then when you get deeper more tyranny happens in a month
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.680]  that happened in the previous decade then more tyranny happens in a week I've
[42:36.680 --> 42:41.880]  studied tyrannies I've it's the same it's like a cancer you know certain types
[42:41.880 --> 42:44.920]  of cancer they know how they grow they know how they behave they know what
[42:44.920 --> 42:50.480]  they do and folks the planet our society our civilization gave in to corrupt
[42:50.480 --> 42:56.320]  politicians corrupt banks corrupt elites with fancy PR men and slick
[42:56.320 --> 43:10.000]  packaging and they sold us pure evil and it's here and it's only going to get
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.080]  worse until you break out of your trance and get angry now I'm going to make the
[43:14.080 --> 43:20.880]  big announcement here I'm authorized to go this far people that don't understand
[43:20.880 --> 43:25.240]  basic journalism I wear many hats I'm a pundit I'm a journalist I'm a film maker
[43:25.240 --> 43:31.640]  I'm a writer I'm a researcher I'm an analyst I've got to wear all the hats
[43:31.640 --> 43:36.120]  here to fight the globalist but under journalism people say tell us who your
[43:36.120 --> 43:42.160]  law enforcement source was for my act on Homeland Security doesn't matter what
[43:42.160 --> 43:44.800]  my source is the government admits those documents are real and are upset about
[43:44.800 --> 43:50.680]  it see the general public so ignorant they're like well why don't you tell us
[43:50.680 --> 43:54.280]  your source because then I wouldn't have the source and it's the same thing with
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.600]  this Jesse Ventura TV show being censored you know I've done some consulting
[43:58.600 --> 44:02.080]  for the show I've appeared in about half the episodes of last season and this
[44:02.080 --> 44:09.160]  season I'm in the episode tonight next week's episode deep research and when I
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.840]  saw the police state episode that I consulted on heavily and appeared in I
[44:12.840 --> 44:17.240]  couldn't believe it was going to go on air and I said that on air I said I
[44:17.240 --> 44:21.120]  cannot believe this is gonna air how the threat fusion centers are spying on
[44:21.120 --> 44:28.000]  everything you do how they're got roundup list this is all on record but
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.200]  never presented on national television the Rex 84 plan the continuity of
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.360]  government plan and and these congressmen being questioned who
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.360]  co-sponsor of the emergency centers act who then made jokes about it and tried
[44:39.360 --> 44:51.520]  to deny it I couldn't believe that that was actually going to air I couldn't
[44:51.520 --> 44:56.120]  believe that that was going to go on air and it went on air now normally when
[44:56.120 --> 44:59.680]  these shows air they air again the next week before the new episode then they
[44:59.680 --> 45:05.640]  air every day in the next week they air them 30 40 times they're re-airing last
[45:05.640 --> 45:09.120]  year's episodes it's got to be in the hundreds now these things are on all the
[45:09.120 --> 45:16.240]  time they're very popular the police state FEMA special only aired one time
[45:16.240 --> 45:23.040]  three weeks ago on Friday night it aired one time and it gave people the full
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.520]  spectrum breakdown Ventura at the end said the police state isn't coming it's
[45:27.520 --> 45:33.600]  here people say it can't happen here it already has it was hardcore I felt proud
[45:33.600 --> 45:37.360]  of being involved I called Ventura up that night at home and congratulated him
[45:37.360 --> 45:41.560]  I called his son Tyrell I called Michael Braverman I congratulated him I'd never
[45:41.560 --> 45:50.280]  done that before I said this was incredible it was scheduled on the
[45:50.280 --> 45:54.080]  schedule to air the next Friday before the new show was supposed to air at 8 p.m.
[45:54.080 --> 45:59.920]  central before the 9 p.m. central premiere of the new one didn't air I kind
[45:59.920 --> 46:06.800]  of thought well maybe it's a snafu then it didn't air again then I started
[46:06.800 --> 46:10.800]  making phone calls and you know you work with people they say well I really you
[46:10.800 --> 46:14.800]  know can't tell you anything unless it's off record well then I can't come to you
[46:14.800 --> 46:21.720]  with something off record so I just called Ventura up this morning he just
[46:21.720 --> 46:25.520]  learned about it in the last few days because he's busy too now he fires and
[46:25.520 --> 46:32.560]  forgets makes the show and moves on and so here's the article updated at
[46:32.560 --> 46:36.120]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com like I don't even know if it's on prison
[46:36.120 --> 46:40.320]  planet yet it went up 15 minutes ago police state episode of hit Ventura show
[46:40.320 --> 46:47.440]  covering FEMA camps pulled from air update from Alex Jones that will put
[46:47.440 --> 46:51.480]  this from info wars.com up on screen update from Alex Jones and Governor
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.240]  Jesse Ventura on secretive police state cancellation you notice they're not
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.200]  saying why it was pulled you notice no one's in the news saying it was
[47:00.200 --> 47:05.360]  inaccurate it's just pulled out of the schedule it's pulled out of them you know
[47:05.360 --> 47:13.800]  and off the site the clips the video clips on the true TV site are pulled it
[47:13.800 --> 47:17.400]  just disappears it just doesn't exist of the eight episodes there's only seven
[47:17.400 --> 47:23.280]  listed now update from Alex Jones and Governor Jesse Ventura on secretive
[47:23.280 --> 47:27.600]  police state cancellation and so I can talk about it because Jesse wants it
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.240]  talked about and he's not giving a full statement yet he's gonna do more
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.240]  investigation but next week he said he'll probably come on the show he's
[47:34.240 --> 47:38.240]  deciding what he's gonna do right now update from Alex Jones and Governor
[47:38.240 --> 47:42.560]  Jesse Ventura on secretive police state cancellation this is an update on the
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.760]  now confirmed bizarre cancellation of the police state FEMA camp episode from
[47:47.760 --> 47:54.880]  true TV schedule which is apparently due to background pressure I wrote this
[47:54.880 --> 47:57.760]  with Aaron right before I went live on there today call him in here I want to
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.200]  update this it is due to background pressure I'm just not authorized to say
[48:01.200 --> 48:05.160]  what I just call Aaron in here right now it's not apparently due to background
[48:05.160 --> 48:12.000]  pressure it is due to grab a background pressure to just have him take
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.240]  apparently out Alex Jones a consultant to the show who appears in police state
[48:17.240 --> 48:21.400]  notice three weeks ago that the episode was scheduled to air before the then
[48:21.400 --> 48:25.320]  newest episode on Fridays at 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central Alex knew the
[48:25.320 --> 48:29.040]  encore presentations were consistently replayed over and over prior to brand
[48:29.040 --> 48:32.680]  new Friday premiere episodes so red flags went up when it did not re-air like
[48:32.680 --> 48:37.000]  all the others now that more inconsistencies have been documented Alex
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.280]  made some phone calls to get to the bottom of the matter this morning Alex
[48:40.280 --> 48:44.480]  spoke with Governor Jesse Ventura and discovered that he was fully aware of the
[48:44.480 --> 48:47.920]  fact that police had been pulled due to pressure from within the government now
[48:47.920 --> 48:51.880]  that's the bombshell that's all I can say and I'm gonna leave it there but out
[48:51.880 --> 48:58.560]  of the government from a branch of government that's what did this the
[48:58.560 --> 49:02.920]  government doesn't want you to see what you saw you understand that in America
[49:02.920 --> 49:07.440]  if they're not buying off a network like MSNBC if they're not paying for it
[49:07.440 --> 49:16.400]  behind the scenes with your tax money the gov just calls up and shuts it down
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  this morning Alex spoke with Governor Ventura and discovered that he was
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.640]  fully aware of the fact that police data been pulled due pressure from the
[49:25.640 --> 49:28.400]  government and I already have that separately from the other sources but
[49:28.400 --> 49:32.000]  now Ventura is out in the open so I can talk about it the former Minnesota
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.960]  governor and star of the show indicated that he's not ready to make a full
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.920]  statement yet and he's still investigating the details and talking
[49:42.920 --> 49:47.320]  with Network execs however Ventura urge that people have a right as citizens to
[49:47.320 --> 49:54.080]  contact True TV and let them know that they want to see it back on air whatever
[49:54.080 --> 49:57.400]  the full cause of the behind-the-scenes pressure it is clear that the government
[49:57.400 --> 50:01.240]  does not want audiences discussing FEMA camps and fusion centers are looking up
[50:01.240 --> 50:07.640]  HR 645 the bill named and read in the episode that authorizes FEMA emergency
[50:07.640 --> 50:11.280]  centers and gives you a blueprint of what they've already built Alex has done
[50:11.280 --> 50:17.120]  all he can to make sure that True TV series is packed with hard-hitting facts
[50:17.120 --> 50:21.520]  and full of real substantial issues though the show employs the dramatic
[50:21.520 --> 50:24.760]  techniques used through television this is not the typical stuff people had
[50:24.760 --> 50:28.080]  better understand that these are truly groundbreaking shows that are
[50:28.080 --> 50:32.080]  discussing damning evidence that the establishment doesn't want singing of the
[50:32.080 --> 50:36.240]  minds of the mainstream audience yeah through their mind control box who knows
[50:36.240 --> 50:39.520]  if tonight's water episode investigating lithium and uranium and
[50:39.520 --> 50:43.360]  fluoride being added to drinking water as a means of population control will
[50:43.360 --> 50:48.080]  itself even air or be repeated after the fact lovers of liberty and supporters
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.520]  of conspiracy theory show had better cue their DVRs and other recorders and save
[50:52.520 --> 50:55.880]  the episode for good because with the censorship we've already seen it is
[50:55.880 --> 50:58.960]  difficult to know how long this program will be on the air or whether its
[50:58.960 --> 51:02.840]  episodes will air repeat normal blood pressure naturally how would that make
[51:02.840 --> 51:08.000]  you feel I'm Don from the Mexican January of 2000 I had a heart attack then

[51:20.120 --> 51:24.440]  taking heart and body extract and within a few days I started sleeping a lot
[51:24.440 --> 51:29.320]  better my blood pressure normalized my blood sugar normalized and my sleep
[51:29.320 --> 51:32.600]  really did improve experience these benefits and more when your body gets

[54:17.880 --> 54:21.840]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up because gold is surging towards another all-time
[54:21.840 --> 54:27.160]  high fourteen hundred and seven dollars in climbing silver going way up the huge
[54:27.160 --> 54:34.160]  announcement China's gold imports surge five fold will get Ted's take on what
[54:34.160 --> 54:42.200]  that means but listeners do you understand that pressure has been put on
[54:42.200 --> 54:46.000]  true TV to pull the episode and it's been gone for three weeks it is not
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.040]  reared like all the other episodes and we don't even know if the JFK is gonna
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.160]  be rearing they're not rearing it tonight before the new show as they
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.840]  normally would that's super hardcore and it just shows that this country's not as
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.600]  free as we thought it was see stuff can fly into the radar the system's pretty
[55:02.600 --> 55:07.200]  arrogant the episodes went on last year but I told you these episodes were so
[55:07.200 --> 55:11.920]  hardcore it it's got the system scared because let me tell you that police
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.840]  state special a hundred percent nailed the takeover program I mean what are
[55:16.840 --> 55:19.960]  they gonna call the Wall Street Journal today or Wired magazine and say don't
[55:19.960 --> 55:24.760]  report that we're tracking everyone in real time illegally no you're the crooks
[55:24.760 --> 55:29.440]  you're the ones doing stuff that's wrong we're done it's time for people to come
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.280]  out in the open about this and I commend Ventura for saying well I'm not I got to
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.440]  do more research but we do know this is going on and we know the specifics but
[55:37.440 --> 55:43.400]  but he wants to flesh it out further on his response before he does something
[55:43.400 --> 55:50.040]  and he even said to me he said what more can I do Alex I mean I go and do this
[55:50.040 --> 55:53.800]  show I fly all over and get groped I try to get the truth out to people and then
[55:53.800 --> 56:01.880]  did and then this happens so you know he gets a little disenchanted but he's a
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.240]  fighter we'll see what Ventura does he's already fought today saying you tell
[56:05.240 --> 56:08.680]  your audience you which they're right as citizens to say they want to see it back
[56:08.680 --> 56:14.760]  on air if they want I want to bring up Ted Anderson Ted what do you think of
[56:14.760 --> 56:19.600]  the police state episode being memory hold well I mean it's just another big
[56:19.600 --> 56:24.040]  brother intervention I mean I don't know why they want to keep the fog over our
[56:24.040 --> 56:28.960]  eyes I guess if they you know if you want to introduce tyranny you want to
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.320]  make sure that the people aren't aware of it but I think everybody's you know
[56:33.320 --> 56:36.960]  they're smart enough to figure that one out it's just a you know it it's just
[56:36.960 --> 56:41.560]  another again it's another nail in the coffin to the our constitutional rights
[56:41.560 --> 56:46.840]  our liberty here as Americans the government wants to keep us you keep
[56:46.840 --> 56:49.880]  the wall over our eyes so we don't know what's going on so we don't fight
[56:49.880 --> 56:53.400]  against this well it's now being confirmed that they are putting people on
[56:53.400 --> 56:57.800]  no fly list to criticize the government including CNN reporters I mean they are
[56:57.800 --> 57:03.720]  so dirty Ted you know Alex it just it boils my blood and I know it does for
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.720]  everybody in this audience I mean we should be just you know I mean obviously
[57:07.720 --> 57:12.280]  true TV is taking a big risk putting Jesse Ventura and you on the air like
[57:12.280 --> 57:16.000]  that I mean but still I mean this is what we need this country is so hungry for
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.440]  this I mean we're talking millions of people that are watching that well I
[57:19.440 --> 57:23.320]  mean here's another wrinkle what did Ventura say he had a three-year contract
[57:23.320 --> 57:28.080]  with MSNBC they hired him basically knowing he was anti-war then stuck a
[57:28.080 --> 57:31.000]  gag in his mouth and said your TV shows canceled even though it got great
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.840]  ratings and you're not allowed to do media interviews for three years yeah
[57:35.840 --> 57:39.600]  they paid him to keep quiet because he's under contract I mean that's the way
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.160]  they operate they know but that I mean of course that but now we know it was
[57:43.160 --> 57:48.080]  the government funding MSNBC all along that's how evil they are now he comes
[57:48.080 --> 57:54.000]  back with another show and government's coming in yeah yeah of course I mean you
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.720]  know that's why when I've been offered by some of the biggest TV networks in the
[57:58.720 --> 58:04.320]  country my own TV show and also my own investigative reports and reality shows I
[58:04.320 --> 58:08.520]  just say no because if I don't act like a clown they're not gonna put it on
[58:08.520 --> 58:16.200]  television and I remember a big filmmaker who made the a show for history
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.320]  discovery channel their most expensive show ever it was almost four million for
[58:20.320 --> 58:24.920]  five episodes and they came back to the director and said make these guys look
[58:24.920 --> 58:29.920]  kooky and he didn't so they just canceled 3.9 million dollar on discovery
[58:29.920 --> 58:33.160]  channel that was three years ago so now when I get the almost weekly calls
[58:33.160 --> 58:38.000]  offering me TV shows I just go no because it's because they won't let it on
[58:38.000 --> 58:52.800]  air stay there Ted you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today hi folks

[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.000]  fellow reserve that runs the country gives trillions of dollars to offshore
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.040]  banks private corporations our news media secretly it's not media it's a
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:47.040]  government whorehouse and yeah there's hundreds of cable channels sometimes
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.520]  something can slip through but if people actually start paying attention to it
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:56.880]  they go hey we can't let this be a trend shut it down so folks tonight you better

[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:13.880]  shut that down too that's too much truth you can't give that to people update
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.360]  from Alex Jones and former governor Jesse Ventura on secretive police state
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:26.040]  cancellation it's confirmed government pressure shut it down government
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:37.040]  threats I mean Ventura was involved I trust him I know he's a real guy who
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.480]  believes in what he says I don't even agree with everything he believes in but
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:44.640]  I know he's for real he's somebody who's who's a good guy and so I went and did
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.040]  the trouble of consulting and helping him and giving him footage and traveling
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:54.120]  around the country I've ignored all the other TV shows because I learned over
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.440]  the years that they said in the Wall Street Journal down here for two days
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:00.640]  interviewing it was just an intelligence gathering operation they
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.960]  didn't write an article a featured cover you know they they they spend weeks
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.560]  off and on over the years interviewing me for a big television show highest
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.440]  budget discovery channel history they just can the whole thing after it's done
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:18.800]  because it makes us look too good oh they air that history channel piece though
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:25.520]  demonizing 9-11 truth every few weeks I was speaking to a full ampla theater of
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.960]  about 400 people they waited till the hour lunch break came up they shot video
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:35.400]  of no one in the bleachers but three people and cut back to me to imply no
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.360]  one was there to hear me speak they they they they blew up the video they
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:45.400]  they morphed and deformed my face oh that airs all the time you imagine being
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.760]  one of those mercenaries but again that was an NBC mercenary with a company a
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:58.400]  subsidiary of NBC that produced that 9-11 hit piece for history channel we've
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:03.240]  analyzed this in NBC and CBS for the big ones on government payroll did you know
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.440]  that the CBS broadcast center in Manhattan I'm going back to Ted after
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:13.480]  the break I'm gonna finish this right now I remember reading it in plain view
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:25.320]  over a decade ago that NBC CBS and ABC and one other network got almost all
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.600]  their news feeds and news gathering from CBS broadcast center in Manhattan and
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.480]  then I learned how my local news most of it was news packages not just on the
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.800]  local CBS but news packages with the video and the text that the local
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.240]  reporter reads it's all written in New York that's why when I saw that piece
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.640]  now five years ago where they said mercury is good for your child's brain
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.780]  it is now nutritious government study shows remember I played that a lot of
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.160]  your new listener and laughing to search the term government says mercury good
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.240]  for your child it'll come up on YouTube and I searched it that day and saw
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:10.240]  hundreds of local TV stations ABC CBS NBC all the exact same words you ever
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:15.200]  wonder why ABC NBC CBS on the nightly news have the same topic in the same
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.000]  order even with the same video and the same sponsors cuz it's all staged they
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.520]  just give you three flavors and Fox figure that out 15 years ago and made
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:31.360]  Fox TV but they just give you a false alternative and they have more viewers
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.080]  and all those other networks combined because folks think oh that's the
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:41.560]  alternative and so media figures out hey the truth sells so they say hey we'll
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:47.680]  give Jesse Ventura a show then people actually start watching it and the big
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:53.240]  boys notice and go uh-uh-uh no sir and I will tell you the show even being
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.680]  re-upped even though it's a big hit probably not gonna happen so that's
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:59.960]  the America you live in land of the cowards home of the slaves will be
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:09.120]  right back tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become

[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only

[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:18.560]  Lloyd Chapman I had a Bob Chapman coming on no relation and of course Mr. Lloyd
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:29.920]  Chapman heads up one of the major business organizations in this country
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:37.640]  he heads up the American Small Business League it turns out and this is MSNBC is
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.800]  reporting it so the government and CNBC the government the government news
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:51.520]  channel CNBC wants you to know Obama administration wants secret blacklist for
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.080]  Pentagon contractors according to the American Small Business League and so
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:05.480]  now there's not just no bid contracts if you don't give the Democrats or whoever
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.560]  is in power enough campaign contributions bribes you don't even get to put in a
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.400]  bid for toilet seats at the Pentagon or for bottled water for the troops or for
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:20.880]  a new roof on the barracks no only the insiders and hundreds and hundreds and
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.960]  hundreds he keeps doing this every week of companies have been given waivers I
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.400]  know I keep repeating this I just can't get over it to not have to get insurance
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.200]  for their employees and so their competition isn't going to be able to
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.760]  compete against that and we'll go out of business you think we've lost industry
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:44.000]  because we can't compete against China and their slave wages and the fact that
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.280]  we don't have all the regulations or that they don't have all the regulations
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:54.640]  that we do I mean this is all about vertical integration special rules for
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.840]  the general public that enslave us and the establishment there's no rules on
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:05.280]  them now shifting gears into the economy this is such a big deal I want to get
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.960]  in Anderson's view on this financial times of London today China's gold
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:16.480]  imports surge five fold gold imports into China have soared this year turning
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.560]  the country already the largest bullion miner into a major overseas buyer for
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.120]  the first time in recent memory the surge what's comes as Chinese investors
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.960]  look for insurance against rising inflation and currency appreciation
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.960]  puts Beijing on track to overtake India as the world's largest consumer of gold
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:38.440]  and a significant force in global gold prices now remember we've always talked
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:43.840]  about 1% a few years ago now 2% of Westerners Europeans and people in the
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:50.440]  US have been buying gold it's around 10% of Arabs close to 50% of Indians only a
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:57.000]  few percentage of Chinese now they're rushing in a billion 600 plus million
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.400]  people that pull up China population I know it's been growing give me that
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.480]  statistic I want to be spot-on thanks guys fact check me on that but over a
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:13.080]  billion and a half people in China China's gold import surge five fold what
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.680]  happens as they do that well gold goes up it's at 1400 plus and the bankers
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.800]  aren't going to be able to suppress it if you look at the long-term gold chart
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.640]  it's going straight up sure there's some dips and the media always runs a hoax
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.920]  and says see golds you know the gold bubble has popped it's not a gold
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:37.200]  bubble okay China population 1 billion 331 million that was in 2009 though a
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.920]  few weeks ago I saw that they've just done a census and they project 1.6 but
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:48.720]  then I saw another report that they've stabilized so point is 1.3 plus billion
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.640]  so you get 1.3 plus billion rushing in you've got right up at a billion in
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:59.480]  India let's see if I'm right about that population for India into like 980
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.320]  something million or is it crossed a billion the point is they're all rushing
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:09.120]  in to get gold Ted Anderson what does this mean for you a guy 32 years in the
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:13.720]  golden silver business what is it going on 14 years with Midas resources what
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.120]  does this mean what's happening in the markets right now Ron Paul says US
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.120]  counterfeit machine will lead to political social chaos key article at
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.680]  prisonplanet.com now they're laying off police all over the country got those
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:31.300]  reports pouring in tax breaks for bailout recipients stirs up debate the
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:35.160]  big banks not only have record bonuses and are taking over they get tax rebates
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:42.160]  tax breaks applicants battle cold for government help to get money for gas for
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.480]  their houses so they don't freeze the death economy added fewer jobs and
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.080]  expected November Wall Street Journal Ted Anderson what's your view on this
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.040]  well I mean you're talking about China well here's the the real proof is right
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:13:00.520]  here gold is at 1409 90 at a peak today currently right now 1407 30 silver at
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:07.800]  $29 and 34 cents at a peak today currently trading at 2924 this stuff is
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.280]  going through the roof because the United States dollars falling look at it
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.000]  from the Chinese point of view these people are savers they have a surplus
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.120]  they do not run debt and they're watching the Western world try to kill
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.920]  their currencies by quantitative easing and and that's not just from the United
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.960]  States it's from the entire there's a concerted admitted G20 plan launched
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.960]  last year to have coordinated evaluation and of course the Chinese are sitting on
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:39.960]  a tremendous amount of US government securities a lot of US cash they're
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.560]  making agreements now with Russia to get away from trading United States dollars
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.520]  for their goods and services services between them you know this whole thing
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.000]  I mean the United States dollar is losing this superpower this this
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:58.440]  worldwide unit-based currency and they're trying to get away from it the
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.800]  United States is doing everything we can to kill it as well I mean that
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:06.360]  quantitative easing I mean we had a report come out today that the jobless
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.240]  claims you know went from 9.6 percent to 9.8 percent and because of that they
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.800]  ever the whole world knows that the Federal Reserve system is going to be
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:22.080]  buying more government securities more Treasury bonds and and pushing more
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:26.200]  newly printed money into the system driving the value of money down it's
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.240]  it's bad news for the United States citizen because anybody that's worked
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.920]  and tried to save or can't you know the wages aren't going to be able to increase
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:39.240]  we are we are dead-facing inflation and there's a great possibility of hyper
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.400]  inflation as well and if it gets to that point you might as well look at what
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.760]  Zimbabwe's like right now because that's what that's what the United States and
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:51.960]  we've got heading and we've got that deadly pincer of you know economy not
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.040]  being manipulated because we've had many examples of inflation and hyper
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.360]  inflation all over the world in the last few thousand years and in many times
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.120]  just the last you know decade in different parts of the world has been
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:07.120]  very well studied under a more natural economic inflation just a corrupt
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.120]  government over printing money because they get to use it up front of their
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.960]  inside operations and to give to their cronies but then over time it then
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.600]  cheats the population with their buying power people on fixed incomes but
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.520]  normally if you have inflation still the economy a lot of times will quote
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.560]  overheat there'll be lots of business going on no no no we have a depression
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.400]  in the real economy an implosion in production in goods and services in
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:44.040]  growth huge unemployment with the inflation laid on top of it and the
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.600]  raising of taxes squeezing those that are productive and then you've got all
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.960]  this behind the scenes trillions being handed out to banks private
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.560]  corporations of taxpayer money Ted I've studied history we've never seen such
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:04.720]  naked brazen out in the open robbing and the government across the board just
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:10.400]  announcing no due process on every front I mean we are going into the real
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:16.320]  tyranny right now I mean it is happening it sure is we've never seen this in the
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.200]  United States not since its inception it is certainly not constitutional it is a
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:25.440]  direct attack on the liberties and the freedoms of the people and this is being
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.280]  driven by this money printing machine and all of our politicians are bought off
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:35.600]  it just and by the way to interrupt Ted Obama's up here with a bizarre statement
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:41.320]  right now in a speech saying we've got to earn our freedom and we've got I saw
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:46.560]  ABC special this Sunday with all these globalists telling us that we need to
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.240]  have national service I mean we are becoming slaves Ted we're almost out of
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:56.320]  time you know there's not a total solution but there is a lifeboat and I
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:02.040]  believe in gold and silver Max Kaiser made the point yesterday that I was
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.400]  promoting silver when it was $5 an ounce of gold what was 260 something
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:10.080]  an ounce and that was 10 years ago and I've risen with silver and gold you've
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.960]  risen with it because we know history when they devalue currencies gold and
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:19.520]  silver goes up it doesn't even mean you're really making a profit it looks
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.120]  like you are with gold and silver up four or five fold the case of silver even
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.440]  more than more than four fold I guess it's five-fold or more now with all of
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.280]  this happening now it's our dollars been devalued and we're just saving our
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:38.000]  wealth Ted Anderson fire out today specials how long you can hold in this

[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:51.080]  be able to have Lloyd Chapman president of the American Small Business League
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:58.760]  ASBL.com and he is the president of the organization and this this integrates
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:02.240]  him with everything else that's happening I just mentioned that if you
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:05.720]  weren't an Obama contributor or Democrat contributor you would get your
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:11.920]  General Motors dealership taken I mean that came out in the news a year and a
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:16.280]  half ago it's come out that you know the no-bid contracts under Bush have been
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:22.400]  expanded select you know good old boys get the contracts the media spends this
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.680]  like oh foreigners don't get to no no no this was American companies now under
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:30.480]  Obama he's going further Obama administration wants secret blacklist
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.200]  for Pentagon contractors according to American Small Business League and it
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.640]  goes on the blacklisting allowed under section 815 would result in de facto
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.080]  departments of federal contractors and and and and debarments across the federal
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.600]  government without due process section 815 does not require DoD to notify or
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.120]  justify its decision to blacklist companies so you don't even know you put
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.120]  your bid in and they never tell you you've been blacklisted that's the
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.400]  hallmark of a fascist society DoD determinations regarding the secret
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.040]  blacklist would be protected from disclosure under the Freedom of
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.280]  Information Act I mean this is just pure tyranny I can't state how bad this is
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:16.320]  number five the legislation represents a reduction in competitiveness in federal
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:19.840]  contracting programs which is the only part of the government growing and as a
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.840]  result could lead to increased cost of goods and services number six the
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:29.280]  legislation consolidates DoD acquisition authority over 300 billion a year in
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:32.480]  defense contracts into the hands of a small group of high-level Pentagon
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.360]  officials which kind of like Chertoff had a homeland security orders the naked
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.640]  body scanners then he goes to the company to head it up after he leaves
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.440]  there's more in here let's get the intel from the export Lloyd Chapman
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.400]  president of the American Small Business League Lloyd you've got the floor
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.320]  break down what's happening well Alex the president that promises the most
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.560]  transparent administration in history is trying to launch a program where two
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.560]  guys maybe three guys at the Pentagon can blacklist any American company that
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:13.080]  works with the Pentagon or or federal agencies without notification no
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.480]  justification no due process and there's no way you can get information on it
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:22.120]  it's exempt it'll be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act reminds me
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.200]  of McCarthyism quite frankly but it goes beyond that because back then they
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.960]  least they'd have a hearing and they would accuse you publicly you have a
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.360]  chance to defend yourself but this is where you can be accused of a crime
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.920]  convicted and that never have a chance to respond and of course the
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:41.080]  opportunities for abuse we couldn't cover all the opportunities for abuse if
[01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:45.960]  we're on the phone for 24 hours but you talked about the car dealerships think
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:49.960]  what's gonna happen if the government has the ability to blacklist the company
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:54.680]  that makes their living selling to the to the Pentagon or other federal agencies
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:40:00.560]  they got an opportunity to blacklist you and my guess is that it's a no-brainer
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.760]  that's gonna be abused and my guess is that people that contribute to the
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:07.760]  administration you know are gonna gonna be the ones that won't be blacklisted
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.320]  and it's just very concerning and it's just it's so sad to see the government
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:19.600]  doing this type of thing but my real concern is it's gonna be used to blacklist
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.280]  small businesses that have objected to the Pentagon's what I call anti-small
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.560]  business policies I don't know if you've seen the stories in the press but the
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.120]  last oh eight years there's been probably 500 stories in the press that have
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.320]  shown that the majority of government small business contracts go to fortune
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:40.800]  500 firms sure well this I mean this is what happened in Nazi Germany is that
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:45.000]  Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler they all became the equivalent of what
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:50.160]  would be trillionaires today because less than a dozen people had to approve
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.360]  everything and so it was quote a free market but everything had to go through
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.320]  them I mean this is designed so that you know generals order a missile system
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.720]  they retire in two years and you know become the board of directors and get a
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:07.680]  million-dollar a year salary this is putting that on steroids I mean this is
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:13.280]  fascism so walk through it for folks well it's basically going to allow three
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:18.040]  people to Pentagon it will most likely be controlled by the White House and
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:24.600]  heavily influenced by maybe four or five major contractors to blacklist companies
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.000]  and what's going to happen is these these small number of major contractors
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.280]  that that I would say virtually control the Pentagon it's common knowledge of
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.320]  Washington if you come along with a more effective product at a lower price
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.360]  they're gonna find some reason to blacklist you and you'll have absolutely
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:45.280]  no recourse they could actually stifle innovation but and so you won't be
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:51.320]  able to have a local Texas company go out and put new roofs on barracks at
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:56.080]  Fort Hood you won't be able to have a local plumber company that has contracts
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:00.880]  to fix toilets no it's gonna be these big mega corporations so they take our
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.520]  tax money send it to Washington and then it's vertically integrated into fewer
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:10.400]  and fewer hands who then won't have an incentive to do a good job absolutely
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.920]  and I like I said there's been oh gosh I've lost track of how many stories of
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.080]  the press I think there's been around 15 federal investigations they show some
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.280]  the largest companies in Italy and England and Holland and France even
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:30.440]  South Korea are getting hundreds of millions and US government small
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:34.280]  business contracts and Obama's allowing that to continue every day in fact quite
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:40.760]  frankly it's about between one and two million dollars a minute and government
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.760]  small business contracts are diverted to large corporations and this secret
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.080]  blacklist I think was potentially designed to go after all the companies
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.880]  that object to it so if you object to the Pentagon getting small business
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:56.560]  contracts companies in Italy they're gonna come down on you blacklist or
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:00.520]  company and see most people stealth of government that's all they do that's
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.500]  what they do for living so if you're blacklisted from selling to the
[01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:06.640]  government you're out of business here and let's be clear we have trade and
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:12.960]  balances with Italy with South Korea with Japan with China more and more of
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.440]  the I saw a statistic 90 plus percent of our components for weapons are now made
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.640]  in China over 90 percent of the drugs the vaccines are now made there and if so
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:29.280]  already we have these trade imbalances but God forbid the federal government
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.880]  actually give contracts to even American companies and now it won't even be
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:39.040]  small ones it's going to be big ones I mean now a town around a military base
[01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:44.320]  isn't even going to be able to get any benefit from having the base there this
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:50.240]  is just insane yeah if you're a small business you know around a military
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:55.080]  base like Fort Hood you'll be losing contracts for post-it notes and big
[01:43:55.080 --> 01:44:00.920]  pens and computers the companies in England Holland France South Korea
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:06.520]  Italy all around the world and that's happening right now and that's not just
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:12.560]  me some conspiracy theory I came up with in 2005 the inspector general for the
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.440]  small business administration said this one of the largest challenges facing the
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:20.440]  small business administration and the entire federal government today is at
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.800]  large businesses are receiving federal small business procurement awards and
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:29.680]  they found a report 514 that the small business administration itself the SBA
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.720]  was giving small bits and contracts to a multi-billion dollar conglomerate out
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:40.480]  of Holland called Berman NV so these are these are the findings of the general
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:45.440]  accounting office the inspector journals for the department interior again the
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.800]  GAO and the SP zone inspector general the SP of the advocacy every day every
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:55.800]  minute contracts that by law should be going to legitimate small businesses are
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.160]  being diverted to fortune 500 firms the administration knows it's happening
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:05.120]  think about we're the worst economic downturn in 80 years small businesses
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:10.120]  generate over 90% of all net new jobs they employ over 56% of the private
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:13.800]  sector workforce they generate over half the gross domestic product and here's a
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.480]  shocker they're responsible for with 90% of all us exports and right now while
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.840]  we're talking the government is giving federal small bits and contracts to
[01:45:21.840 --> 01:45:26.160]  companies overseas and fortune 500 firms and if you complain about it you're to
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:30.080]  get blacklisted if this if this secret blacklist passes we're talking to Lloyd
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.480]  Chapman the president of the American Small Business League ASBL.com let's
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.080]  walk through I'm gonna make some points then get your take on it let's walk
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.560]  through that of course the vast majority of our exports are small
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:48.440]  businesses there aren't any by and large big industries left here to export so
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.960]  it is that micro economy and those specialty niche items that are still
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:59.160]  having this country run then you start shutting them down this is really about
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:04.720]  price-fixing that's what the Food Safety Act is about openly in the last month
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.520]  12 million dollars spent by big mega agribusiness to shut down small farms
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:13.320]  and ranches to allow the federal government to come in and and just have
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.800]  unlimited power to put bureaucracy on them though most of the food safety
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:22.280]  problems we've seen in the next public numbers come from the big mega agribusiness
[01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:26.200]  the Tyson chickens and others so they're lobbying to shut that down it's about
[01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:30.120]  price-fixing once you've only got two or three chicken packers or beef packers
[01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:35.040]  once you've got most local farmers working for big mega agribusiness then
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.800]  they can get together and price-fix and control the market and jack up prices so
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:44.640]  it's the same thing here you shut small businesses out they don't even know they
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.440] 've been shut out when they're putting their bids in that allows the insiders
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.640]  to jack up all of their prices I mean this is so diabolical your take on what
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:56.960]  I just talked about well you know I'll say something interesting I was talking
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.520]  to a seven-year-old kid about two months ago and I said if you were trying to
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:05.640]  stimulate the economy and create jobs and you knew that small businesses
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.760]  created 95 percent of all the net new jobs how much of a stimulus funds would
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:15.080]  you give small businesses he said well 95% the Obama administration has given
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.400]  maybe 3% of the stimulus funds of small businesses 3% now the companies that
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:25.480]  create 97% of the net new jobs half the gross domestic product 90%
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.000]  exports are getting 3% of the stimulus funds that's why the unemployment
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.240]  rates are coming down well that makes me think of a Bible verse that out of the
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.480]  mouths of babes here's the seven-year-old saying put the money in small
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:42.920]  business but the big mega businesses they've got the lobbyist oh absolutely
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:50.080]  absolutely in fact I'll take something fascinating when the house small business
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:53.920]  committee has hearings on federal small business policy you know who's always
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:48:00.720]  there to testify Boeing Boeing aircraft so when nitty belasquez has a hearing on
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.480]  federal small business policy and to look at why government small business
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.200]  contracts are going to fortune 500 firms knowledge of a small business group
[01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:12.880]  has ever been invited to testify I've never been in the room there and of
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.720]  course Boeing has moved to China yeah well by the way today what we're talking
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:20.880]  Boeing is getting federal small business contracts they get they get
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.320]  hundreds of millions in federal small business contracts so that's what your
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.320]  organization does is tries to tie the small businesses together if small
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:33.600]  businesses started funding their own lobbying groups and got aggressive we
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.920]  could kick these multinationals out but now we learned trillions of dollars
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.080]  have been stolen and given to elite corporations with bailout money I mean
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.080]  there's no end to it you know I'll take something when I when I talk to people
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.520]  about politics they're complaining I always tell them one thing it's much
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.720]  worse than you think it is so as you and I are talking your people are listening
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:56.760]  I want to assure people that what's going on in this country right now what's
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:00.320]  going on in Washington what's going on the bomb administration is much much
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:05.120]  worse than you think it is it's more corrupt than you think it is and it's
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:10.160]  I would have to call it sort of anti-middle class but think about a
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:13.320]  federal policy by the way that allows fortune-fivority firms to get small
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.120]  business contracts that's happening right now and the SBA you know is the one
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:22.400]  that came up with it but by the way I here's what we should talk about real
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:26.360]  quick let's talk about what people can do yes sir let's talk about it in fact
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:30.240]  that was my next question how do we counter this legislation but more than
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.000]  that how do we roll back the corruption that's already rampant all right here
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.080]  here's my advice I have all the stories on this my website ASBL.com

[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:53.240]  we've been on television and people can take a look at it but call your

[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:18.680]  here 97% of the stimulus money to these mega corporations who were offshore and
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:23.080]  now they don't even want small business to be able to put a bit in basically is
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.280]  what this amounts to you wonder why we don't have an economy it's because it's
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:34.440]  a rigged game and the big mega banks they want socialism to take your money
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.680]  and then give it to them so it's socialism on the bottom with fascism on
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.040]  the top and that's what the stupid leftist and stupid right-wingers will
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:48.640]  not get but before 110 years ago if you read a political science book this is
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:53.240]  all it talked about they have given us false information you've got to have
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.360]  local control you've got to have true free market and we need to shrink the
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:02.200]  size of government so much of the waste is these big mega corporations small
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.880]  businesses will bring competition to that now in closing it's exciting know
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.320]  that Lloyd Chapman is from Austin Texas of course we're out of Austin Texas but
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:15.280]  his organization is not based here he's got more than a hundred thousand members

[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:26.120]  United States Lloyd there's 28 million small business in this country and not

[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:37.160]  about 30 contractors or employees and how much does it cost to join your

[01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:01.320]  Obama administration so we don't just sit around and talk we do oh yeah what
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:05.000]  they're doing is totally criminal so if we lay down we're gonna lose what's the
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:11.640]  saying that winners never quit and losers what's that saying I can never seem to
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:15.840]  get it right that I forgot here's something that quitters never win and

[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:40.920]  action and I just want to commend what you're doing how good a chance does this
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:46.720]  legislation have a passing this this s3454 unfortunately I would say it's
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:50.200]  probably got about a 90% chance of passing because the Pentagon controls
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:54.520]  our government when you go to Washington DC like I do all the time and you're
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:58.440]  sitting in a congressman's office there's a bunch of magazines sitting on the

[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:06.720]  full-page ads for the nation's top five defense contractors if you look at the

[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.120]  health care that's New York Times telling you how great it is they're gonna
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:35.560]  cheat everybody nobody's safe but they wear the troops like a mantle of honor
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:41.000]  the big defense contractors and tell you how patriotic they are to sell you
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.080]  their takeover the economy it was the Pentagon we're going back to our guest
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.360]  here in a moment that got us to accept the uniform universal product code that
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:56.280]  wants us to accept RFID that funded Google to spy on us they're taking over
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:00.680]  the economy and now trying to shut small businesses out of the economy after
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:04.280]  we paid the taxes we got about three minutes left with the president of the
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:10.000]  American Small Business League ASBL.com Lloyd Chapman briefly finish up
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.200]  with your point about the Pentagon runs America you're in these meetings and
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:17.200]  tell them what you see well you know what you know when Eisenhower left
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.720]  office his last speech was he said beware of the growing power of the
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.840]  military industrial complex and if you go to Washington you know these big
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:30.160]  defense contractors like Lockheed and Boeing and Northrop and Raytheon they
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:34.320]  run Washington they're the they spend more money lobbying than anybody else
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:37.960]  member president Obama said there'd be no places administration for lobbyists
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:41.880]  yes first thing you did was it was a point of Raytheon's lobbyist over
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.120]  procurement for the Pentagon that's how much power they think and now he's got
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:53.360]  Monsanto lobbyists running the FDA yeah so these big defense contractors are
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:57.520]  incredibly powerful but they get whatever they want in Washington DC because
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:02.920]  they've got the money. Washington runs on money and the legislation that's
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:06.520]  get passed in Washington is not the legislation that's good for the
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:10.560]  American people it's what the big defense contractors and big corporations
[02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:16.280]  you know pay for and it's just really really unfortunate but just think you
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.520]  know federal law says 230 billion a year and government contracts should go to
[02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.480]  small businesses there's been 15 investigations say that most of that
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:30.480]  money goes to these fortune 500 defense firms if we could stop that that would
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:33.960]  put more money into the middle class anything the president Bush or president
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:38.600]  Obama ever spoke up. All we have to do is just quit giving small business

[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.520]  people do something if you're patriotic and you love this country I'm named

[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:57.200]  bomber when he's 21 and I've run up feeling very patriotic and I'm fighting

[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.760]  get on the phone and I call people but if you love this country do something and

[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:12.360]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:20.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:24.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:28.720]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:33.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.720]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:13.600]  armory of resistance it's why the globalist have been attacking it trying
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:17.760]  to take it down I mean Jesse Ventura's police state episode that I consulted on
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:22.280]  that was one of the main forces behind and I appeared in censored that's coming
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:28.000]  up the minute I mean it's all happening we're effective that is scaring them and
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.120]  prison planet TV's a big part of the resistance to get against this whole
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:38.080]  system now everything is happening so fast that sometimes I think my head is
[02:11:38.080 --> 02:11:41.600]  actually spending but before we get into the economy and all this I want to talk
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.400]  to Bob Chapman who joins us for an hour every Friday at least and sometimes
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:51.440]  more and of course Bob was the biggest private silver and gold broker and he
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.480]  had the biggest financial newsletter until he retired he came back over a
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:58.520]  decade ago he has international forecaster.com he worked in a counter
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:04.920]  espionage against the Soviets with secretive government agencies he's a
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.360]  patriot he of course co-published and helped Gary Allen get out his Nundair
[02:12:09.360 --> 02:12:13.800]  call a conspiracy his son runs of course Gary Allen's son runs Politico now
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:18.120]  today Bob has been a real driving force for almost 50 years against the
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:23.000]  globalist and you know the fact that they are trying to censor really shows
[02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.160]  how effective we are here's the breaking news police state episode of hit
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.960]  Ventura show covering FEMA camps pulled from air and people are scared at the
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:35.640]  network they're scared in the production they wouldn't really give me all the
[02:12:35.640 --> 02:12:39.480]  info we know that they when they air a show they reared a whole bunch it wasn't
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:44.840]  reared it was delisted from the website it disappeared I called Ventura he just
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:49.760]  learned about it he said yeah basically government threat directly from a
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:55.080]  government group I'm just gonna leave it at that pressure network heads being
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:00.440]  called I'm just gonna leave it at that being contacted men in suits breaking in
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.640]  trash cans threats you've heard Tyrell talk about that a few weeks ago saying
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:08.800]  folks you're lucky this is on air well now you're noticing it's not and who
[02:13:08.800 --> 02:13:12.920]  knows of the if the water special will air it just so happened to break two
[02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:16.760]  weeks ago in Texas news they are putting uranium in the water well that's
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.840]  what their episodes about that they're putting uranium in the water to
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.640]  sterilize us okay see if you serve this corrupt system you're a cop FBI agent
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.840]  don't laugh at this you think it's cute your kids are drinking uranium and that
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.000]  they're publicly saying they want to add lithium that's gonna air supposedly at
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:39.000]  nine o'clock central tonight 10 p.m. Eastern let's see if it does they they're
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.600]  not rearing the JFK episode tonight before it as they have always done in
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:48.760]  the past they'll air the last episode they're in last year's episode about
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.120]  global warming I'm in that one too folks this is happening and now the whole
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:56.360]  show next year is in jeopardy doesn't matter if it's got top ratings on their
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:01.600]  network doesn't matter that's why the system scared this thing went under the
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:06.000]  radar last year and part of this year but now it's not and then you know it's
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.880]  creepy folks it's creepy to learn they're putting reporters on no fly list
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.520]  it's creepy that Bob Barr is doing a four-year on myself and Matt Drudge
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:18.440]  reportedly being spied on by TSA it's creepy no one Homeland Security listens
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:22.520]  to all my phone calls but you know what they're crooks and I'm standing up to
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:26.200]  them my children aren't gonna be slaves it's given into corruption that's
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.960]  brought us this far you got a gut up and just say look I'm not putting up with
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:35.680]  it any more crooks and everybody else was scared to talk about it I called
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:40.000]  Ventura and he said I've got to find out more but yes it's confirmed probably
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.240]  come on next week I have to decide what I'm gonna do but people have a right of
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:46.920]  citizens to call true TV and contact them and say we want to see that back on
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:50.800]  air they didn't pull it and say it was inaccurate they just pulled it and hope
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:55.800]  you didn't notice because they've I'm not supposed to get into more of it until
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:59.120]  they're ready to talk about it if they even are but I'm not sitting around I'm
[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:01.960]  glad Ventura said go ahead and talk about it because you know once you're
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:04.840]  in confidence with people it's a journalistic thing that you don't break
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:09.680]  that confidence but Ventura said go so he's the boss on the show boom I'm
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:15.760]  giving it to you Bob Chapman what do you think of that it's something that you
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:23.440]  should expect when you're effective this is what they do and you know this has
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:28.000]  been going on all the years that I've known you and then some and it's not
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.840]  gonna go away and they're gonna get more aggressive as we go along and they're
[02:15:31.840 --> 02:15:35.760]  gonna do everything possible to keep the American people from knowing the truth
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:41.040]  about anything and never mind the American people your broadcasts they
[02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:46.440]  go all over the world you're waking up people everywhere and it's wonderful
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:49.640]  yeah they're probably gonna they're probably gonna try to kill me soon but
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:55.280]  whatever well now you know I did what I did and we had this conversation over
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:00.840]  ten years ago yeah you've left the country you've got to constantly move well
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:06.200]  I do so that they can't keep track of me but yeah it's worked out good and why'd
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:10.880]  you decide to move when they tried to plant hangar nades on you or oh that
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:17.600]  was back in 75 I go back a long way with these people I mean they started
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:23.160]  really leaning on me in 1967 and they've never stopped because I'm supposed to be
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:27.360]  one of them and they don't like it when I'm not one of them seeing that they
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:31.880]  train me and that's where possible thing that can happen to them well that's why
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:36.360]  my act at homeland security say their number one enemy is veterans that's
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:41.480]  right because we know how it's played and that's why I've done that veteran show
[02:16:41.480 --> 02:16:47.280]  or the Marine Disquisition for over five years it's number one and blog talk and
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.520]  has been for years because I want these guys to know what's going on we need the
[02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:59.840]  military to defend the American people in our way of life not these monsters
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.200]  that have been Washington and the transnational conglomerates and Wall
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:10.120]  Street and banking and be between that group and the pharmaceutical companies
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:15.520]  and insurance they come up with almost all the money to buy off the politicians
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:21.200]  they really virtually control the country and the gentleman who was before
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:28.280]  us this was course of doubt a double feature Chapman to Chapman and anyway
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:33.240]  he came right out and said that and he's got you know in-house experience on that
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:37.480]  and he's one of the biggest business he's one of the biggest business member
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:43.080]  groups in the country and he said we've got a criminal crook government well
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:46.640]  we've been saying the same thing for a long but you're noticing more and more
[02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:51.080]  Americans would say this over beers a decade ago now prominent people are just
[02:17:51.080 --> 02:17:58.440]  telling it like it is and they can't get us all Bob no they can't in fact they
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:06.080]  probably only can get maybe 20 million out of 300 million I mean when they go
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:11.400]  to move against us it's going to be the sorryest thing they ever did because
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:15.440]  they're not going to get any support if the Pentagon thinks that they're going
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:24.160]  to order line offices around and noncoms and gunnies they're crazy we have them
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:32.120]  in our camp not in theirs they're good decent hard-working men and women who
[02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:36.520]  put their lives in the line every single day for this country and we're going to
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:41.000]  back them a hundred percent and if something happens it's nasty I'll be
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:48.120]  the first one to head over the border and join them believe me as old as I am
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:57.160]  well we need to keep you in the rear with the gear Bob somebody's got to do
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:03.640]  the public relations yeah well you know what at the end of the day at least we
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.480]  didn't lay down and let boats and go down without a fight whatever happens
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:12.960]  that's right you can't give up you've got to keep going and going and going you
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:18.400]  can never ever accept defeat and I've run my whole life that way and you have
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:24.480]  to and we want everybody else to emulate that quality it's extraordinarily

[02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:43.640]  happen and these people have gone too far they had a good deal going and now
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:49.680]  they're gonna get crushed well history shows you're right but it's gonna be one

[02:24:10.800 --> 02:24:17.480]  we've got a new report out on Ventura TV show tonight shocker feminizing
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:26.480]  uranium fluoride and lithium and water to be exposed on Ventura TV show and
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:29.880]  Erin did a great job hammering this article out real quick I think I'm
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:34.520]  gonna have him at the bottom some of the Texas news where the government he
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:37.440]  hid that there was uranium in the water the news doesn't tell you they're
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.920]  adding it and by the way that's confirmed I mean it's crazy it's gone
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:47.200]  this far that they just did they're just killing us slowly out in the open Bob
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:56.640]  Chapman you know it's interesting that you say that because probably about a
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:02.040]  year and a half ago they did the same thing with their manipulation of the
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:07.800]  markets particularly gold and silver for years and years starting in 1988 they
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:14.120]  try to cover up what they were doing and for a long time up until oh probably
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:22.160]  1998 I was the only one who wrote about it everybody thought I was crazy as
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:29.480]  usual and of course they were all wrong but they're right out in the open with
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:35.000]  their manipulation of the market they just don't care anymore and of course we
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:40.200]  had employment figures come in today and the government knew yesterday what they
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.640]  were going to be that's what did they do gold runs up $10 they whack it back down
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:49.960]  again silver was up 60 cents they whack it back down again so it wouldn't rally
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:55.560]  as much today when the cruddy news came out on unemployment so what happened
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:00.920]  gold is up $20 today which is double what it was of yesterday and silver's
[02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:07.080]  up about 60 cents and so what they do can't last long but they don't care
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:12.440]  about that they're they're a bunch of stopgappers they run around like
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:17.640]  wild Indians trying to put their finger in the dike everywhere and it's not
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:23.200]  going to work it's like the home of the hat mad hatter or something they are in
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:28.640]  the open no I mean it's in the Wall Street Journal Wired magazine they just
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:33.360]  come out and say everything you do is listen to and watch in real time we're
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.600]  tracking every purchase you make with with any digital and then it's trying to
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:42.600]  intimidate us now we knew this a decade ago or more with the telecommunications
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:46.760]  act that codified it but we saw the infrastructure being paid for now they
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:50.920]  just come out and go yeah we commit felonies just every millisecond yeah
[02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:56.160]  we're just total crooks yeah there's uranium in your water I mean and now
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:01.400]  the WikiLeaks thing I'm what do you think of that it looks like a
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:06.560]  disinformation operation to me because most of the stuff for anybody that's
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:11.680]  paying attention they knew it the only thing I saw that I didn't know is the
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:19.720]  Hillary Hillary's instructions to professional personnel in the State
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:24.200]  Department to spy on others I would have thought I would have gotten that
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:30.200]  because you're gonna laugh when you hear this but the State Department not only
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:33.560]  gets and I don't know where they get it from but I've talked to the person who
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.640]  gets it gets my publication and they sent it to every consulate and every
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:43.480]  embassy in the world and then it goes out all over Washington well Bob you
[02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:47.200]  know that the State Department the Department of Agriculture all these
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:50.540]  departments they've always been riddled with spies I mean all major
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:54.160]  governments do that but I mean I think the fact that Hillary just ordered
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:28:01.200]  everybody to spy I mean that's amazing it certainly is but it shows you what
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:06.440]  she's an integral part of what's going on but that was the only surprise I saw
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.400]  and I'm sure in January I guess they're gonna come out and say a bank or two is
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.280]  on the verge of bankruptcy well heck anybody that's involved in this thing
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:23.080]  like you and I and all our listeners they know that the banks are broke so
[02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:29.800]  what's you know what's the big deal so I don't see anything world-ending in that
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:34.080]  we're gonna go to break in a minute and come back in the long segment I want to
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:38.280]  get started now though I've been really researching Max Kaiser's push with along
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.480]  with zero hedge and others who I respect to try to crash JP Morgan by buying
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:48.680]  silver but I read the gold antitrust committees press release a few days ago
[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:52.520]  about it and they said look we commend Max and I can pull it up read the quotes
[02:28:52.520 --> 02:28:56.480]  but people can go look at it this will bring out manipulation into the open
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:28:59.280]  and it may hurt a lot of the big banks that are shorting and it will drive the
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:04.640]  price up but JP Morgan's only three billion you know you know in for this
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:09.360]  and you know they'll find ways of covering it what's your view of Max
[02:29:09.360 --> 02:29:15.960]  Kaiser's plan absolutely terrific psychological warfare it's not the fact
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:20.440]  they're gonna get stuffed financially oh three billion or whatever it is and
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:25.560]  again I shouldn't play that down you know Max is stuck his neck out like very
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:31.040]  few people have over a number of years it said let's do this and I think it's a
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:36.760]  great idea maybe it's only five billion dollars whatever it is we're giving them
[02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:42.840]  nightmares all right stay there let's come back and talk about that on the
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:47.760]  other side absolutely it reveals the fraud we'll get into the Chinese what
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:52.760]  they're doing with gold and a lot more stay with us we're on the March the

[02:33:09.520 --> 02:33:18.280]  go to the TSA in Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones I rarely get
[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:23.040]  so mad that I talk over the liner I'm so enraged by what I just confirmed over
[02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.200]  the break from Bloomberg business week that I can hardly talk if anybody ever
[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:33.800]  wanted to know that Boehner I don't know why she was real name boner I don't know
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:43.760]  that's how it's pronounced it's German it's boner I don't know why Boehner is
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.840]  getting away with what he does but he's out there lying about the unemployment
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:54.080]  he's a globalist he's a newt-genrich protoge and nobody should be surprised by
[02:33:54.080 --> 02:33:57.600]  the fact that he gets to go around the TSA naked body scanners well here's
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.800]  Bloomberg business week says Boehner is doing everything you can told Bloomberg
[02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:06.800]  to prevent Ron Paul from becoming chairman of the House Banking Committee
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:12.840]  and its seniority Ron Paul is supposed to be the chairman hey how about we cause
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:17.240]  a move to get Ron Paul to be the new speaker of the house instead of Boehner
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:24.360]  aka boner I mean I mean this is what needs to be done so this is new breaking news
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:29.480]  on this front we'll get a link to that up on info wars.com and
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:34.120]  prismplanet.com will also get that video up where the seventy something year old
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:38.080]  guy lives on family farm is being kicked off by the city that's annexed it's
[02:34:38.080 --> 02:34:42.120]  saying he's not allowed to basically have a farm in the city they're getting
[02:34:42.120 --> 02:34:45.000]  rid of the grandfathering rules all over the country I mean this government's
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.200]  just completely criminal we're gonna get that up I'm gonna go into the economy
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:54.360]  with with Bob Chapman here in a moment but but folks listeners you are so
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:57.960]  awesome you're the reason we're having such a big effect sure I put the hours
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:01.920]  in do the work bring on the guests that I respect who've really been accurate in
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:05.280]  the past and who have a good understanding of how the world really
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:09.000]  works but it's you the listeners that carry the bowl down the field and
[02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.120]  normally in the last six months since we've been doing Google bombs I only do
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:16.080]  it like once a week or so but we've been doing a lot this week because Google
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:21.560]  censoring is so much and we need to put light on the fact that they're
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:26.800]  censoring Jesse Ventura's TV show and that'd be a great search term but since
[02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:29.600]  the article doesn't say censoring the TV show we need to use something out of
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:33.000]  the headline show that millions of other people will end up reading this and
[02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:36.440]  learning about it and putting pressure on it it's also important to contact
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:40.960]  true TV online or I guess next week I'll give you their phone number to try to get
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:45.560]  that episode back on dealing with the FEMA camps and the fusion centers spying
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:58.800]  on the American people but let's let's let's make let's make Ventura show the
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:03.200]  number one search term you've got to use something rare or it'll get mixed in
[02:36:03.200 --> 02:36:09.000]  with a bunch of other articles that have similar headlines Ventura show FEMA
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:14.720]  three words Ventura show FEMA so three words or two words and a abbreviation
[02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:23.080]  but Ventura show FEMA Ventura show FEMA Ventura show FEMA let's make that the
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:26.160]  number one term the few times we haven't gotten the number one search we've got
[02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:29.280]  like number two or three is when I've done it at the end of the show but I know
[02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:32.280]  we have a huge audience everybody puts it in Google over and over again in about
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:38.760]  three hours it'll be number one Ventura show FEMA that's that's unique
[02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.520]  enough that it'll it'll it'll take them to info wars.com and prison.com and in
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:47.320]  other sites since we're blocked by Google you just copy the article and then
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:50.080]  you'll get the traffic which is great I just want the information to get out
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:55.280]  Ventura show FEMA says Google's blocked us on Google news Ventura show FEMA
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:37:00.600]  Ventura show FEMA that's the number one search term and let's do this too let's
[02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:03.960]  hit them with another torpedo let's fight even harder resistance is victory
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:10.280]  never giving in never giving up feminizing uranium I think folks need to
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:12.840]  read this article and know about the show coming up tonight that they're
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:16.520]  putting feminizing uranium and it's also very poisonous and toxic in your water
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:22.080]  out of the phosphate mines feminizing uranium those are the two search terms
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:27.320]  Ventura show FEMA is number one number two feminizing uranium it's up to you
[02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:30.360]  it's your mission if you choose to accept it Bob Chapman what do you think of
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:35.640]  that idea I think it's terrific and I think you should evolve for the next
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:43.720]  one by going after a boner and his pressure that he's under from the
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.440]  bankers and Wall Street not to give Ron Paul his assignment on the committee is
[02:37:48.440 --> 02:37:54.280]  the chairman and I think people should let him know that the next time he runs
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.920]  there'll be a hundred thousand people or more in his district campaigning against
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:06.240]  him I tell you what I'll get a blurb up by Paul Watson right now and and we'll
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:15.120]  the headline will be John Boehner John Boehner scams for Federal Reserve and
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:20.920]  let's just have another search term John Boehner scam how do you spell how do you

[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:53.840]  scam and then have the subheadline that he's moving to run a scam because

[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:58.920]  there and stick it to us then then boners gonna have his way with us so it is
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:07.120]  very very important to stand up stand up against these people we have John
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:11.680]  Boehner's phone number I hate having to use his false name but people know him
[02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:21.400]  as Boehner John boners phone number 202-225-6205-202-225-6205 and tell him
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:27.000]  that Ron Paul must chair the House monetary policy subcommittee or
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.160]  Republicans will pay the price well now they're even debating him even being on
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:33.160]  the subcommittee I thought he was gonna be the banking chair this is
[02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:37.080]  disgusting I mean I'm so bad what I mean next will Boehner say Ron Paul's not
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:39.960]  even allowed to be in the Congress even though he wins all the Republican straw
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:44.880]  polls Bob Chapman well that's what they would like and of course I know that's
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:49.800]  not gonna happen but they're gonna try to isolate him this is an isolation
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:56.240]  process and if we don't go to bat for Ron Paul they're gonna get away with it
[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:00.000]  and we don't want that to happen I mean look at they've done to our economy
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:06.320]  this is Wall Street and banking they destroyed the American dream we've
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:11.160]  lost eight and a half million jobs 42,000 corporations through free trade
[02:42:11.160 --> 02:42:16.040]  globalization offshoring and outsourcing it's been a very genesis of the
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:21.560]  destruction the transfer of power particularly the the manufacturing
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.840]  sector the transfer of power to them and now small businesses won't be able to
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:28.120]  get government contracts openly I mean these people are just out of control
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:35.160]  here's Boehner's fax number 202 225 0704 it's time to Tea Party him every time
[02:42:35.160 --> 02:42:40.840]  he shows up in his district that Newt Gennrich globalist slime bag make it
[02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:48.200]  number one folks John Boehner scam John Boehner scam Newt Gennrich globalist
[02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:55.480]  trash let me give you his Butler County office this doesn't make any sense
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:00.960]  because I know unless I'm going crazy Boehner's out of Michigan isn't he
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:08.360]  because this has got him out of Ohio if he's from Ohio I'm oh that's right he's
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:11.840]  from Michigan I know that I got so many facts in my brain I can't remember them
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:22.200]  all anymore okay here's his Westchester Ohio address 513 779 5400 513 7795
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:35.080]  400 513 7795 400 is his field office his Miami County office is 937 339 1524
[02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:41.680]  and his DC district of criminal slime bag nest is 202 225 6205 I tell you
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:51.520]  folks this is unbelievable Bob Chapman more comments on this front I think we're
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:57.320]  seeing a an argument going on between the Europeans in the United States as to
[02:43:57.320 --> 02:44:04.800]  how to handle the endemic problems among the banking community and the the
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:12.000]  approach to bankruptcy of so many countries and today the Europeans backed
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:17.920]  off and said they're going to use QE to type of injection of money and credit
[02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:27.400]  into the banks in Europe so that they'll be able to hang on as Greece
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:34.080]  Ireland Portugal in Spain and perhaps even Italy go bankrupt there's
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:40.000]  absolutely no way they can get them out they can't bail them out it's just too
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.200]  expensive between that group five countries the cost will be three to five
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:51.600]  trillion I don't think they're gonna be able to do it Bob and that means that the
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:56.120]  eurozone will break up and probably the European Union and the average German
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:59.200]  will just love that because they didn't want to be in there in the first place
[02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:04.600]  and neither does anybody else according to the polls now let's go back to the fact
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.280]  that they've announced this week that they are gonna cut 2 million veterans
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:14.280]  government insurance and cut pension funds I mean that is really a bold move
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:21.480]  that is unbelievable unbelievable and you know if it hits a fan they're gonna
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:26.000]  have to deal with these people and these people are hardcore intelligent
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.160]  professionals I mean I would not want to be in Washington to New York City when
[02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:36.840]  they get these guys and ladies mad and it's sure to happen I mean how do they
[02:45:36.840 --> 02:45:43.040]  think for one second they can get away with that that's horrible they're
[02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:50.560]  openly doing it I mean even worse than cutting Social Security and again they
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:54.560]  they keep saying oh well it's to pay off the debt this won't pay off any of the
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:58.840]  1.5 quadrillion this is all going to the bankers you got to get rid of the
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:04.520]  bankers you know we just saw that in Greece and you and I did all those
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:11.200]  programs over there and then they're doing it in Ireland Ireland the two banks
[02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  are broke the country's not broke they want the money to come in to bail out
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.480]  the banks which are owned by Europeans and they have the head of the Central
[02:46:21.480 --> 02:46:26.400]  Bank in Ireland openly say quote it's good to have foreigners own your country
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:33.280]  unbelievable well I'll tell you if I lived in Ireland I wouldn't be very happy
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:37.560]  well the same things happening here I mean it's just crazy shifting gears
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:42.440]  back into gold what does it mean to have the Chinese announced last week that
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:45.640]  they're not going to engage in trade with Russia with dollars anymore as
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:49.040]  international currency and then suddenly we hear they're increasing their
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:54.320]  purchasing of gold five-fold I mean I don't think JP Morgan and all the
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:57.680]  King's men and all the King's horses are going to be able to suppress the price
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.240]  anymore if this is happening well it certainly is happening it's been
[02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:07.120]  happening for the last couple of years with the public now the Chinese have
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:13.360]  been taking all gold production and buying it internally domestic and the
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:17.800]  Russians have been doing the same thing the Chinese have been surreptitiously in
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:23.600]  the market using hedge funds to buy for them the Russians they don't care the
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.240]  every time the IMF sells gold they say how much you got oh 32 tons fine we'll
[02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:34.680]  take it all and so they know what they're doing and incidentally you know in
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:43.360]  96 I think it was 96 let me think oh six maybe it was at another time but anyway
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.880]  Gadda had a meeting in Alaska and one of the people who came was one of the key
[02:47:47.880 --> 02:47:51.960]  people in the Russian government in finance and listen to all the speakers
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:58.880]  there I didn't go but I remember it and so they know what's going on and I'm
[02:47:58.880 --> 02:48:02.760]  sure they passed it on to the Chinese and the other BRIC partners are theirs
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:09.440]  but gold and silver are going up and there's nothing they can do to stop it
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:14.640]  in this business that's going on we talked about Max Kaiser and you know
[02:48:14.640 --> 02:48:19.640]  let's take Morgan down well maybe they won't take Morgan down but they're gonna
[02:48:19.640 --> 02:48:23.880]  give him an awful headache they're gonna force them to cover their shorts this
[02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:29.960]  five class action suits one of them Rico against Morgan they're gonna lose and
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:35.040]  four of the suits they'll probably pay off on the other one who's a pro on the
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:41.320]  floor of the comics who brought the Rico he back and down he's gonna take them
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.280]  all away well here's the key and this is wonderful exactly when everybody starts
[02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:50.400]  attacking them it doesn't even mean we're all gonna win but resistance is
[02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:55.200]  victory when we start standing up and we're in the right if we fire a thousand
[02:48:55.200 --> 02:49:01.080]  torpedoes at them it only takes one and I got news folks 500 torpedoes are gonna
[02:49:01.080 --> 02:49:05.000]  hit them and then when more torpedoes start hitting them everybody else sees
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.400]  that they've got power other people start firing torpedoes all we got to do is
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:16.120]  get in the fight and start swinging we have our own Cy war going on against all
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.920]  of these terrible people that we have to deal with and Max has put himself up
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:26.320]  front and I think that's great just like you do yeah well I would you know I
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:32.080]  covered carried positive articles on what Max had to say already and there's a
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:37.680]  group in Germany which interviews Max and myself and and we carry a lot of this
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:42.560]  stuff in English and German both we have a lot of German subscribers and I'm
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:48.920]  sure the Max does because he's in Europe but these are the kind of things to put
[02:49:48.920 --> 02:49:53.960]  a burr under their saddle they're gonna run a hundred different places putting
[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:58.800]  fires out and if they're doing that they can't have enough time to mess with
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:05.520]  us yeah the answer is just swarm them like a bunch of piranhas they can't
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:16.320]  stop us death by a thousand bites man yeah here's the take all the metal you
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.280]  can but it won't break JP Morgan the secretary and treasure for Gata Chris
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:26.840]  Powell says that but he goes on to praise the silver by saying it will
[02:50:26.840 --> 02:50:31.400]  expose the manipulation and it will drive the price up which overall will
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:38.800]  expose the overall fiat currency movement that's true well we know this
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:42.120]  just the exercise of resisting is victory as I've said a million times
[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:45.640]  I'll say it a million times again I want to come back and talk briefly about some
[02:50:45.640 --> 02:50:50.560]  other things that are happening in the economy what's going on with the TSA and

[02:54:34.840 --> 02:54:38.760]  now it's starting to come out and drudge is linked to this today CNN reporter
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:45.800]  put on a watch list after criticizing TSA former congressman Bob Barr who's on
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:49.560]  next week now he's putting in four-year request about them spying and
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:53.440]  persecuting members of the media that criticize them state and local lawmakers
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:59.640]  are moving to throw the TSA out of the states that's how the Washington Times
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:05.960]  they really are reaching too far here's raw story exclusive TSA frisk groom
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:10.880]  children to cooperate with sex predators abuse experts says I mean the
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:18.080]  world it isn't hype to say is really waking up to tyranny right now Bob well
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:23.440]  they are and it's for exactly what you said they're taking this too far and
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:31.720]  in particularly with TSA and as we've discussed on the program before they
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:37.040]  have a number of objectives number one psychological warfare number two making
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:41.040]  people do things that they wouldn't normally do so they can control them and
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:49.400]  then insulting them by touching them where they shouldn't and having machines
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:57.200]  which can get people cancer and what are they looking for probably we're not
[02:55:57.200 --> 02:56:00.880]  going to use the machines anymore we're not going to touch you anymore but you'll
[02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.160]  have to give your fingerprints in an ice cap they've now announced that yeah
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:11.000]  that's the plan they're just incredible that I just guessed at it no I know Bob
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.880]  that's why you're smart that's what's amazing is that once you know them you
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:17.200]  know what their plan is going to be and so many times I'll say I bet they're
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:20.000]  planning this and then somebody sends me an article where they're already doing
[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:24.760]  it same thing just happened there but just for you we've only got about three
[02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:27.280]  minutes left I want to encourage folks they want a free copy of the
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:32.440]  international forecaster to call 800 686 2237 or go to the international

[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:54.160]  minutes left here Bob Chapman what else do you think's important on your radar
[02:56:54.160 --> 02:56:58.400]  well it's only a matter of time before the European nations that are in trouble
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:03.000]  go down and they know that and there's no way out for them they're trying to
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.920]  grab as much money as they can before they do go down and they don't have a
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:11.400]  breakup of the Euro and then the European Union and that'll take a couple
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:19.160]  of years maybe more in the meantime there in in the United States Congress and
[02:57:19.160 --> 02:57:22.760]  Senate they're going to try to get as much legislation passed as they can
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.880]  between now and the end of the year and because they're not going to have another
[02:57:26.880 --> 02:57:31.760]  opportunity to get some of these dreadful things true and so you've got a
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:37.080]  fight against that you got to be up on what they're after and what they're
[02:57:37.080 --> 02:57:42.840]  trying to do like this dream act that's coming up next week I understand that
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:52.080]  this FDA this new food act is not going the way they like it too because that
[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:55.880]  shows they know full well a spending bill can't start in the Senate they just
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:58:04.280]  try to do it anyway just like any dictatorial power I mean this is what
[02:58:04.280 --> 02:58:08.480]  corporate as fascism is all about they've been going to give them a go-ahead
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:15.080]  to do anything they want they're untouchable it's just like the big firms
[02:58:15.080 --> 02:58:22.360]  versus the SEC and the CFTC the CFTC and the SEC work for the big firms I
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:28.880]  was there well for 11 years they were told exactly what Madoff did and they
[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:33.000]  protected him I mean this is a group of criminals but their hubris will bring
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.440]  them down Bob great to have you on Lord Willem will see you next Friday I'll be
[02:58:38.440 --> 02:58:53.280]  back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. great job crew
