[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Another world. Another time. Another time. In the age of wonder. In the age of wonder. Another world. Another time. Another time. His life was green and good until the trist of fact.
[00:27.000 --> 00:43.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance. Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[00:43.000 --> 01:03.000]  I've said this many times and it's always been true. But as the world quickens, as time and space and technological developments accelerate, as populations explode, as knowledge increases, but also ignorance for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:03.000 --> 01:22.000]  As time and space piles on, it is harder and harder to even try to scratch the surface of the incredible developments, but somehow I've got to do it today. Because each story has other stories that are corollary that give you the big picture.
[01:22.000 --> 01:37.000]  We have Hurricane Harvey hysteria. Customers all over Texas fight a store sellout of water and other key staples. Why do people never have the basic staples, most folks?
[01:37.000 --> 01:53.000]  And then images from space are just unbelievable. Like I said, it's from the International Space Station. If you're watching us on television, we are a radio-slash-television transmission.
[01:53.000 --> 02:09.000]  This report is up on DrudgeReport.com. Hurricane Harvey hysteria. And they are calling it the perfect storm. No pun intended. Harvey to make landfall as cat three hurricane, 40 inches of rain, latest updates.
[02:09.000 --> 02:17.000]  I'm looking to send some reporters down there right now. Worst case scenario looms for Texas with Hurricane Harvey.
[02:17.000 --> 02:31.000]  Storm of the decade. Perfect conditions could make Harvey the strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. in 12 years. As Texans are told, get out of dodge before a 130-mile-an-hour wind and rain cause alligator-infested floods.
[02:31.000 --> 02:42.000]  It's actually true. They took the ban on hunting alligators off of 10 years ago or something. They're like running around like roaches. My son killed three just a few years ago and won an eye.
[02:42.000 --> 02:53.000]  I'm ten feet long. That's bigger gators than Louisiana now. So Hurricane Harvey could be a flooding disaster. A storm stalls over Texas. They get three inches in Houston. They flood.
[02:53.000 --> 03:01.000]  They're talking 40 inches and it's building. It's accelerating. And it's set to start hitting tonight.
[03:01.000 --> 03:13.000]  This thing kind of crept up on us. It was first this tropical storm in Category 1. We're not sure. Category 2. Category 3 accelerating right towards Texas.
[03:13.000 --> 03:22.000]  Gonna hit around Corpus Christi, Port Aransas. They haven't been hitting decades there by a bad hurricane. And then turn up the coast and rampage up through Houston.
[03:22.000 --> 03:36.000]  But part of it hits Austin and San Antonio. But that's the left flank. If it keeps its track, it is going to devastate Houston and the entire area north of Corpus Christi and Port Aransas.
[03:36.000 --> 03:44.000]  One of my favorite fishing spots down there. So it is barreling in, folks. Our prayers are with all the folks that are down there.
[03:44.000 --> 03:57.000]  Now that said, there's the other big giant news. We broke back on August 4th with Jack Pasobak, who had been in meetings with folks from the White House, who were told, you don't visit infowars.com.
[03:57.000 --> 04:06.000]  And then of course the media totally ignored that. Even though it came directly from high level sources. Well, it's now in U.S. today.
[04:06.000 --> 04:15.000]  Politico broke it. Oh my gosh, the exact words we said have now been confirmed by basically General Kelly.
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  And his argument is, well, he's keeping all news from the president. But those sites are, I guess, some of his particular favorites so that people can't just do walk-ins.
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  And they're real worried about his son, Donald Jr. bringing him stuff. And then the media tries to spin it. They're saying it's fake news.
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  Yeah, fake news. Like, you were going to win the election, the polls were off, or fake news. Like, the president was getting ready to get rid of Renz Priebus and Spicer.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  We said they'd get rid of him on a Friday, and they got rid of him on a Friday, or all the hundreds of other big things we told you that came through.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  Just like we told you that Kelly had done this two and a half weeks before anybody else did. Oh, and then there's the big news.
[04:53.000 --> 05:00.000]  The other fake news running the headline that I have proof Michelle's a trainee.

[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[06:04.000 --> 06:17.000]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[06:17.000 --> 06:24.000]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[06:24.000 --> 06:38.000]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[06:38.000 --> 06:48.000]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  What does Stephen Bannon call the fight against the globalist? He calls it a war, an information war.
[08:25.000 --> 08:32.000]  Why do you think the globalists are after us so much? Why do you think they're demonizing me so much?
[08:32.000 --> 08:42.000]  Why do you think they're coming after us on every conceivable front with straw men and so many other forms of deception?
[08:42.000 --> 08:52.000]  It's because the globalists know that we have their number and that we're aware of their operations and that we've read their books and read their publications
[08:52.000 --> 08:59.000]  and understand they're establishing a private corporate world government that controls all the major parties
[08:59.000 --> 09:08.000]  and creates a synthetic form of consensus to bring in a post-industrial anti-human New Dark Age.
[09:08.000 --> 09:18.000]  And that's their words not mine. An authoritarian technocracy where the future doesn't need humanity and where we're obsolete.
[09:18.000 --> 09:28.000]  These are the big issues that should unify all of us but instead they make it a partisan issue then they have the Democratic Party attack you
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  and you can't help but then fight back in a partisan way because the only folks organized to battle back against it are the Republicans
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  but half of them are neocon globalist collaborators and so you're surrounded basically in a pincer attack
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  but the good news is the people of the world are waking up.
[09:46.000 --> 09:53.000]  Authoritarian, unelected globalism is in trouble and the elites admit that in their own internal publications and in leaks.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  So we have right on our side, we have history on our side, we have the numbers and we are beginning to transcend their propaganda
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  but they are intensifying their old tricks to the next level. We're going to cover this very dangerous hurricane.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  The worst they're saying to hit the United States in more than 12 years.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  We've seen record low hurricane activity in the last 12 years but now Hurricane Harvey is coming barreling in, set to hit later this evening.
[10:21.000 --> 10:32.000]  Now reportedly we put the track up on screen for folks is going to rampage up the coast hitting somewhere around Corpus Christi and Port Aransas
[10:32.000 --> 10:41.000]  and then turning to the east and plowing up through the central eastern part of the state.
[10:41.000 --> 10:48.000]  We'll be able to cover the hurricane from right here in Austin Texas but I am talking to my brave reporters to see who wants to bite the bullet
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  or draw the short straw while horses couldn't drag them away.
[10:52.000 --> 11:01.000]  To jump in the old Ford F-150 I've got here for the office vehicle and drive down close to the coast to show the bare shelves,
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  the people fighting over water that's being reported and to show the big evacuation.
[11:06.000 --> 11:17.000]  I don't think we need our guys to be there when it makes landfalls or the famous image of the reporter blowing around in their rain suit
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  or in their raincoat but we want to just show how precarious civilization is
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  and how a storm or an earthquake or a war or a disease outbreak can destabilize things so incredibly quickly.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  So that's coming up and it's absolutely key.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  We've got Jack Pasobic joining us.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  He broke back on the fourth of this month two and a half, three weeks ago.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  White House of Staffers, if you like Info Wars or Milo you're fired
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  and basically said it's banned in the White House and don't show it to the president.
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  Of course no media that's fake picked it up, all the real media did pick it up
[12:00.000 --> 12:09.000]  and now it's in Politico, it's in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, it's in Buzzfeed.
[12:09.000 --> 12:16.000]  That indeed we are dead on accurate and exactly as we said has now been confirmed and reported
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  but notice they don't give Jack Pasobic credit.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  I have Charlie Wurzel's number from Buzzfeed and the organization that poses as reporters,
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  their PP gate, comic book, fantasies and the rest of it that they write fiction on
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  and I text messages and I said are you going to add this to your story?
[12:35.000 --> 12:40.000]  Jack Pasobic broke it word for word, he has a good point, he texts it back
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  but I didn't really get clarification on whether he's going to update the story at the top to say
[12:44.000 --> 12:51.000]  wow Info Wars is right again just like we called exactly when pre-bus and others would be fired
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  and who would be brought in.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  Just like we told you about the smart meter spying on you
[12:56.000 --> 13:02.000]  and the bisphenol A causing you to have sexual cancers in your organs
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  and all sorts of other problems and infertility.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  Everything we talk about is basically in the main literature, the scientific literature.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's just not in pop culture.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  So I had countless people, I mean many people walked me in Seattle and go you are a liar.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'd go why? And they'd go gay frogs.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  And I'd go well that's not true, a lot of you saw the live feeds on the streets.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  I'd go that's not true, that's funny then, huh?
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  So let me just show you here on this on my computer, on my phone
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  hundreds of studies about Atrazine causing about half the frogs in most of the U.S. to be bisexual or sterile.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  They said I don't want to look at it, you're a Nazi.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  And I'd say don't you care about your kids. One guy had his kid with him.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  This run-offs causing cancer, serious problems. He said no, I care about Nazis.
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  And I'm like I understand you're Captain America, you found a Nazi now.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  This isn't live action role-played, bro.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  I'm a real person. The globalist created the Nazis. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[14:06.000 --> 14:10.000]  The Cold Springs Harbor, IBM. They're the ones fighting me.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  You know what, Nazi? F off.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  I'm like yeah, it just feels good to say you found a Nazi and shake your finger at him.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  Because Tom Brokaw told you with no proof and MSNBC said,
[14:22.000 --> 14:29.000]  but I'm actually here exposing this program that's declassified to literally sterilize your children.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  And it'll give you breast cancer, this is secular cancer, you name it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  I mean just a few of these chemicals, they don't want to hear it, folks.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  They're already committed to the lie. It feels good. They feel smug.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  They're part of the establishment, even though they're useful idiots, they don't want to know.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  So that's coming up.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  Also, armed anti-fuck, which means pro-fascists, but they call themselves anti-fascists.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  Remember, just always invert it and you're actually back up and down.
[14:57.000 --> 15:01.000]  Armed anti-fuck called for open revolution, violence against police.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  We've got a bunch of videos, a bunch of special reports.
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  Again, the subjects joining us, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Doug Hagman, Roger Stone,
[15:09.000 --> 15:14.000]  and so much more will probably be going live to a feed too from the White House.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  With Mike Cernovich who's been there reporting, getting a lot of key intel all week.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  He's been inside the White House all week.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  So that's going to be coming up as well as we have some excerpts of that
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  or go to some of that live for you right here in the next three hours and 45 minutes.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  But before we go any further, I can see this coming a thousand miles away.
[15:35.000 --> 15:46.000]  Remember Trevor Noah, but also the Daily Show and the Late Show or whatever it's called with Stephen Colbert.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  I don't really keep track of the shows.
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  I just see the clips where they attack me sometimes.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  They attack me daily now, so there's no way to cover it at all.
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  Seriously, I haven't even watched most of the new clips of them attacking me last night, the night before.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  But I knew what I saw and I said it on here about two months ago.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  Wineth Paltrow puts out her own supplement line.
[16:10.000 --> 16:15.000]  And they didn't want to look like they were persecuting just a quote conservative, even though they were.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  So she drew the short straw.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  They picked her and I said, all of our products are being bought by big think tanks,
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  watchdog groups, the Daily Show, the Late Late Show, the Late Show.
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  They're all buying it.
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  They don't even hide it on the receipts, NBC, ABC, CBS, Time Warner.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  They're buying everything, D Magazine, Newsweek, Time.
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  They're all buying our products and then sending them off to be tested.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  And they found that they were the cleanest out there in the Big BuzzFeed study with a very aggressive California lab.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  But I said, look, they're not done.
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.000]  They've chosen poor Gwyneth Paltrow as the sacrificial lamb to go, oh, look, we're calling for consumers.
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  Everybody to sue and go after Alex Jones.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  But we're throwing Gwyneth Paltrow in there as well.
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  Because she's saying seaweed baths are good for your skin or whatever.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  I mean, that even says that it's Walgreens.
[17:10.000 --> 17:15.000]  But see, nobody's going after Walgreens.
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  Nobody's going after CVS that sells colloidal silver.
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.000]  Nobody's going after Bezos that owns Whole Foods and Amazon.
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  I asked BuzzFeed this morning, I said, why are you still doing all this when you know it's just to target me?
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  And they couldn't even deny it.
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  Couldn't even argue because it's true.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.000]  And so they're not going to stop.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  You have to understand that.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.000]  And if they can't get a California lab to spike it, they'll find somebody too.
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  They mean business.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  These people launch phony wars.
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.000]  They do it all.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.000]  They're fake individuals.
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  They're fake liberals.
[17:48.000 --> 17:53.000]  And so they're trying with everything they can, John Oliver, all of them.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  They've launched a new Jordan Kepler program that's like The Daily Show.
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.000]  That'll air five days a week where he debuted clips last night on The Daily Show saying,
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  I play Alex Jones and I say the things he says.
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.000]  No, you don't.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  You don't say anything I say.
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  You're a fraud that's stolen my identity that then misrepresent it.
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  But again, this is what they do.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  And then their weak-minded viewers will attack me on the street believing the things he says.
[18:19.000 --> 18:24.000]  This is next-level psychological straw man warfare.
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  So here's the new news.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  I told you they were doing this.
[18:29.000 --> 18:34.000]  Advertising Watchdog files complaint against Gwyneth Paltrow in two cherry-picked districts
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  of California with it with district attorneys calling for criminal charges against Gwyneth
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  Paltrow for claims she made.
[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  Now you know how this works.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  First, they're going to indict her, then it's Alex Jones, even though I haven't made the claims.
[18:49.000 --> 18:50.000]  And we've got the lawyers.
[18:50.000 --> 18:51.000]  We're ready.
[18:51.000 --> 18:53.000]  We're going to make major hay out of this.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  We're going to turn this around in a judo move.
[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  I know we are, because we always do.
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  But the poor thing has got to be, you know, SWAT-teamed first.
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.000]  Because again, they want to make it look like it's not partisan as if when I depose all these
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  groups and all these people and get their emails and put private eyes on them and things
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  we've already done to some of these groups, as if we don't already know the strategy I
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  told you months ago, as if we're not already ready, as if we can't show that it's racketeering,
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  as if they're not used to having someone counter sue them because they're not used to somebody
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  seeing what they do and understanding their operations.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  Even if they ever got it in front of a jury, do you imagine?
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm selling the exact same products sold in Whole Foods
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  and they even make more claims than I do.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  But why am I here?
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  I'm here because of my political speech.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  And even if you don't agree with my speech, do you believe that I should be witch-hunted
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  and hauled in here to be fined millions of dollars or thrown in prison because I dare sell
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  melatonin and say it's associated with better sleep when that's a fact?
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S. and launches a new missile every other week.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  Their warhead of choice, electromagnetic pulse.
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  Such an event would cripple the U.S. power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.
[20:10.000 --> 20:11.000]  Are you ready?
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  You can be with a Solarc EMP-hardened solar generator.

[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  I'm going to go through the hurricane and how serious it is.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  This is not hype.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Folks, no, I don't hype hurricanes unless they're really serious.
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  This is serious.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  And I've got family directly in line of it.
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.000]  I tend to have reporters down there covering it today and tomorrow.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  The aftermath is what's key.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  Our story is on dredgerport.com.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  Hurricane Harvey hysteria.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  Customers fight a store sellout of water.
[24:46.000 --> 24:57.000]  See the video, see the photos at infowars.com, newswars.com, and of course, drudgerport.com, the mighty drudge report.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  Boy, the globalists hate that that organization exists.
[25:00.000 --> 25:06.000]  Now, we're also going to get into the total hysteria where Pelosi doesn't know where she is again.
[25:06.000 --> 25:15.000]  She's calling Trump, George W. Bush again and says the Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolf in a crowd at theater.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  I don't know who has worse dementia.
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  I don't know if it's her or if it's Maxine Waters, but these people are out of their minds.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  And then they're the one setting up a commission to look if Trump has dementia.
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  I'm not kidding.
[25:35.000 --> 25:41.000]  In fact, there's Democrats, I saw it on CNN this morning, saying that they're going to be on this commission.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  And the question was, will they be bipartisan or fair?
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  That's a joke.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  It's like, again, saying, well, Hitler sit in judgment of himself at Nuremberg.
[25:53.000 --> 26:04.000]  But the question is, they're the ones that obviously have had more Botox than anybody else in history and don't know what planet they're on.
[26:04.000 --> 26:15.000]  Aleppo is where in Korea, where Putin attacked Korea, President Bush, he needs to learn that he's a problem.
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  They don't know what planet they're on.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  So that's coming up so many clips, so many guests today.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  But first, let me get back to Gwyneth Paldrow.
[26:26.000 --> 26:34.000]  The poor thing, when I saw it, because these things go out in talking points from the Democratic Party and from Hillary and through Zucker and others.
[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  I mean, it's admitted.
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  So the exact same scripts everywhere, every major comedy show starting two months ago.
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.000]  Oh, look at Gwyneth Paldrow.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  She's a cook.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  She's a nut.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  She's evil.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  Supplements are bad.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  None of them work.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  You know, she's totally insane.
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.000]  Oh, and look, she sells some of the same type stuff that Alex Jones does.
[26:53.000 --> 27:02.000]  And I went, that poor thing, that poor thing, they've just chosen to burn her so that, oh, we're not just singling out Alex Jones.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  Look, we got Gwyneth Paldrow too.
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  They won't go after Bezos who owns Whole Foods and Amazon, the biggest seller of supplements, and some really bad ones.
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.000]  Whole Foods sells the highest quality, right down to stuff that's known to be bad.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  I mean, hell, you can go to the big stores at the malls.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  We all know the name.
[27:18.000 --> 27:26.000]  They got sports enhancers, they've tested their stuff, and they find amphetamines sometimes in the sports enhancers because I guess it works.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  They try to put stuff in there that works even though it's illegal.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  That's why they're always catching sports enhancement stuff, you know, filled with stuff, but that's not supplements.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  That's not nutrients.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  That's why they studied ours and said it's just really well-known herbs.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  In fact, none of it's really fancy or, or, or, or, or, you know, really complex.
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.000]  It's, yeah, it's staple, concentrated, cold pressed, and, and other systems.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Exactly.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  And now advertising Watchdog files complaint against Gwyneth Paldrow's Goop.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  That's her company for deceptive health claims.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  How dare she said some health and wellness events she put on?
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  Going Hollywood to get into that because only Bezos is allowed to make the money.
[28:08.000 --> 28:16.000]  In response, Goop says T-I-N-A org provided limited information and made threats under arbitrary deadlines, which were not reasonable under the circumstances.
[28:16.000 --> 28:24.000]  And it goes on to say a Madison, Connecticut based nonprofit that describes itself as dedicated to empowering consumers to protect themselves.
[28:24.000 --> 28:33.000]  And then it goes on from false advertising, sites 51 examples in which Goop touts products on her site, either seriously or implicitly.
[28:33.000 --> 28:46.000]  And then it goes on to say that they've gone to two different chief attorneys, district attorneys in two counties in California.
[28:46.000 --> 28:54.000]  Just like they use Travis County to go after Republicans and that they're calling for her to be indicted basically for criminal activity.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  That's what it says right here.
[28:56.000 --> 29:03.000]  So it's like, oh, we're not targeting Alex Jones. We indicted Gwyneth Paldrow first.
[29:03.000 --> 29:09.000]  And he got all these Democrat TV shows saying, look at Gwyneth Paldrow, look at Alex Jones, get them, get them, get them, get them.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  They're not allowed to sell L-Tryptophan. They're not allowed to sell Melatonin.
[29:14.000 --> 29:20.000]  But I can walk in any Walgreens anywhere else and it just says right on the bottle, help you have better sleep.
[29:20.000 --> 29:30.000]  This is just well-known fact, but in hundreds of studies, but we don't even say that. We just say, well, we've got Melatonin and L-Tryptophan and Valerian Root and all these other things.
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  And boy, when I personally take it, it helps me sleep.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  They're like, arrest him. Good Lord, throw that man in jail. Can you believe what he did?

[29:52.000 --> 30:19.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:22.000 --> 30:37.000]  We're on the run.
[30:37.000 --> 30:55.000]  Anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival. Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion. Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.

[31:26.000 --> 31:40.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[31:40.000 --> 31:54.000]  The Lexapure Breeze will be a steal at $300-400. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[32:00.000 --> 32:19.000]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy and told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[32:19.000 --> 32:30.000]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[32:30.000 --> 32:43.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[32:43.000 --> 32:51.000]  You can pull these studies up for yourself. This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[33:17.000 --> 33:26.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[33:26.000 --> 33:37.000]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:37.000 --> 33:48.000]  Everybody understands this fact, but I want you to really focus on it, because if they can take Trump down or they can take me down, they can take you down, and they mean to take you down.
[33:48.000 --> 34:01.000]  They admit it in all their publications, how much they hate you and your family. They admit they absolutely want to tear down God, tear down the family unit, and totally dominate the human species itself.
[34:01.000 --> 34:14.000]  That is the ultimate tyrant dream since the beginning of civilization, and they believe that they are now within grasp of that holy grail, of that satanic brass ring.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  And poor little Gwyneth Paltrow is not a mainline leftist. She's more of a libertarian. I've known for years. She was in a film exposing chemtrails made in Australia.
[34:23.000 --> 34:33.000]  I know folks that know her. They told me a decade ago that she was dialed in. Hollywood knows that. So they said, who are we going to burn and make an example of?
[34:33.000 --> 34:40.000]  We're a burner, because we got to burn her before we burn Alex Jones.
[34:40.000 --> 34:49.000]  It's not hard to figure out when it's the same talking points on the news and on all these so-called comedy shows that are really fake news that hides behind, oh, we're just comedy.
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  I play Alex Jones' character and I love Hitler.
[34:53.000 --> 35:05.000]  Major movies, TV shows, HBO shows, Netflix shows, all of it, and it goes on and on and on and on.
[35:05.000 --> 35:19.000]  And now you read on and they filed with two district attorneys in two different counties to make sure I guess they get one of them that does it.
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.000]  A complaint calling for criminal charges. That's rarely done. Usually they call for civil penalties.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  But no, we want her criminally locked up. That's your Democrats.
[35:29.000 --> 35:43.000]  Yeah, we'll show everybody in Hollywood to stay in line and we'll show everybody about Jones. We'll get some district attorney to indict him. Do it! Let's go!
[35:43.000 --> 35:51.000]  I'm so ready for this. You think I'm just going to go and say, I'm sorry, I didn't know it. I'm going to go. Boom, we've got your files. Boom, we're subpoenaing this.
[35:51.000 --> 36:00.000]  Boom, we're going after the watchdog group. Boom, we're getting the files from the Daily Show and the Late Late Show and all the rest of the shows that admittedly are being directed.
[36:00.000 --> 36:10.000]  And then people inside those organizations, I know, are going to leak us all the emails and the coordination with the Democratic Party and George Soros because we've already been given some of it.
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  Oh, yeah. And guess what? It's already saved on servers in other countries.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  You don't just think I figured all this out on my own, do you?
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  We know all about the lawyer meetings in D.C. and the ones in Los Angeles and the ones in Austin, Texas.
[36:30.000 --> 36:38.000]  And we know about the ones in New York and we know all about it and we've got some of your names and some of your little emails.
[36:38.000 --> 36:50.000]  What, did you just think you were going to destroy me and that there weren't other forces fighting you? You just think I'm all here by myself?
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  Everybody knows I'm not going to back down and give up. That's the only reason I've been given all this support because I'm not going to waver.
[36:57.000 --> 37:07.000]  I'm not going to falter. I'm not going to have them threaten me, my family, everything and promise it'll all be all right if I just back down.
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  No, it's going to be all right because I'm going to run you over because I'm just the tip of the spear.
[37:15.000 --> 37:25.000]  By the time you figure that out, the spear would have already gone past you because it went through you politically in a loving, peaceful way.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  And you'll never know what hit you because it already hit you.
[37:30.000 --> 37:43.000]  You're already flailing around politically, bleeding to death, announcing how powerful you are and putting out all your talking points, how you're invincible and how you're unstoppable.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  But you're not.
[37:45.000 --> 37:51.000]  So, just because they're doing this, I'm going to announce a money bomb for two weeks out.
[37:51.000 --> 38:06.000]  But I want to be the biggest we've ever done for the war chest for all these attacks that are already here and the attacks that are coming and you see our expansions and our new shows and the new reporters and everything we're doing to really have an even stronger war chest just dedicated.
[38:06.000 --> 38:15.000]  And I'm already doing it getting the top lawyers lined up, different sectors of the country, so they're ready on the ground when they launch different operations.
[38:15.000 --> 38:26.000]  Because don't you want us to win, but whatever you do, just go to infowarstore.com today and buy the supplements and buy the water filtration and buy the coffee that they say is a scam.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  You know, they're saying I'm making claims that coffee wakes you up.
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  I'm serious.
[38:30.000 --> 38:40.000]  They're trying to get criminal charges for that because I'm a bad person, you know, selling coffee, high quality organic coffee from Mexico, high mountain desert, actually locally sourced.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  What's the term?
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  Wild source is beyond organic.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Limited time flash special.
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.000]  It's super male vitality for 57% off and infowarslife.com.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  We've never done that before.

[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  Stamina, energy, libido, I personally experienced it's got well known herbs that are concentrated and cold pressed.
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  3,600 plus reviews on power reviews, a third party site, and they even had groups go at them and say, this isn't real.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.000]  Let us see your records.
[39:14.000 --> 39:15.000]  They laughed and said, sure, here it is.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  It's all real.
[39:16.000 --> 39:23.000]  You think anybody could go create tens of thousands of fake reviews, 3,000 for one product alone.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Thank you all for your support, folks.

[39:45.000 --> 39:52.000]  infowarstore.com or triple A2533139.

[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  These two formulas are the perfect super combo for supporting a healthy thyroid and supercharging your health.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  Selenium helps support the immune system.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  DNA, production, thyroid health.
[40:09.000 --> 40:17.000]  And I say, true iodine helps support healthy hormone levels and healthy metabolic systems and much more.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  You die without iodine.
[40:19.000 --> 40:20.000]  That's not a claim.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  That's a fact.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  It's like, Jones claims you need oxygen to live.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Complete conspiracy there as he claims coffee wakes you up.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  I got it.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  I just saw Whole Foods years ago best selling organic Chiapas coffee.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  I went and found out where you got it, brought it in and sell it.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  But it's okay for them to say really delicious aromatic organic volcanic soil coffee.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  I mean, I didn't even say coffee wakes you up.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  They're saying the name wake up.
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  You can't prove coffee wakes you up, you criminal.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  You failed.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  You ever heard such a scammer?
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Such a fake news.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  D Magazine, hometown newspapers.
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  Look at Jones and they use coffee and go look at the false claim.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  We want criminal charges.
[41:10.000 --> 41:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he sold melatonin and said it made you sleep.
[41:16.000 --> 41:17.000]  But he did something worse.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  He sold coffee at $5 a pound less than the very same stuff is at Whole Foods.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  And he called it.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Now get ready for this.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that man sitting right there.
[41:29.000 --> 41:37.000]  That devil sold coffee with the name wake up America.
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  We all know America is a white supremacist term on top of it.
[41:40.000 --> 41:51.000]  Not since they emailed out an image of a white baby with an American flag in its hand that the ACLU have we seen such disgraceful radical evil.
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.000]  We call for five years in prison and $2 million five on that devil.
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  And this isn't even a joke.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  Fake news.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  The baby photos have a flag in its hand.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  Click on the tweet.
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.000]  That's a crop photo.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  Show the evil triggering American flag.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  There it is.
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  Bingo.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  A little run of stories saying I'm lying about this.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  But the ACLU said we're so sorry.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  We won't do it again.
[42:24.000 --> 42:25.000]  Don't call us.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  Literally don't call us racists.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  No.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  Don't do that.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Not that.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  No.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  I'm sorry.
[42:31.000 --> 42:32.000]  I'll do whatever you say.
[42:32.000 --> 42:33.000]  Do whatever you say.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  Just take my guns, my children, everything.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  Just open the borders up.
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  I'll do whatever MSNBC says.
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  Just don't have time.
[42:38.000 --> 42:41.000]  But don't go call me a racist.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Please keep me in check.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  Oh, but the ACLU didn't get what they did.
[42:46.000 --> 42:47.000]  They sent out Kermit saying he was sorry.
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.000]  Don't you get the code?
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  That's papula frog.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  The ACLU is white supremacist.
[42:54.000 --> 42:55.000]  Oh, my gosh.
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Oh, why didn't I see the code words?
[42:58.000 --> 43:03.000]  Code words.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Look, I'm going to the end, folks.
[43:05.000 --> 43:06.000]  And I'm not scared of all these attacks.
[43:06.000 --> 43:07.000]  I'm very honored.
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  Hell, they expect sometime I'll probably get a parking
[43:10.000 --> 43:11.000]  garage or something.
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  They'll kill me.
[43:12.000 --> 43:13.000]  I mean, that's just the way the ball bounces.
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  I chose this because somebody's got to do it.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  And not because I'm a hero.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  This is survival of the species we're talking about
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  against a satanic pedophile army.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  You better believe I'm fighting them.
[43:27.000 --> 43:28.000]  You couldn't get me to stop.
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  This isn't courage.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  This is instinct.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  This is absolute beyond will.
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  This is compulsion.
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  It'd be like if I was living back in the 50s
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  and Marilyn Monroe was at her peak
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  and she wanted to go on a date with me
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.000]  and I wasn't married man.
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  It's not.
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  It's a torture having to take her out to dinner.
[43:50.000 --> 43:55.000]  I will assure you this is a pleasure to be persecuted.
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  A pleasure to be attacked by the pedophile army.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  It is an enjoyment.
[43:59.000 --> 44:00.000]  It is an honor.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  Our forebears gave up everything.
[44:02.000 --> 44:03.000]  Their kids got killed and they died.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  And they were imprisoned on prison ships
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  and killed and tortured to death so that we'd have this.
[44:08.000 --> 44:11.000]  And I'm upset that they're coming after me.
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  I am just barely walking up the steps to join my ancestors.
[44:16.000 --> 44:21.000]  I am not even a good person yet.
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.000]  And I intend to join them.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  Because everything they gave to us,
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.000]  they imparted will and honor and strength
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  and they transmitted it spiritually
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  down through the time through men and women to us.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  And we now here are the holders of that great honor,
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  of that great title.
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  And we must be strong in the face of these satanic forces.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  Please support us at forestore.com.
[44:47.000 --> 44:57.000]  Now, let me give you some really big news.
[44:57.000 --> 45:02.000]  I've not been sure about Michelle Obama being a transsexual.
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.000]  And I'm very serious when I cover this.
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.000]  Sometimes I look back and it seems silly
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  to even be covering such a subject until you realize
[45:14.000 --> 45:17.000]  the globalists are like a tranny cult.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.000]  In the culture, in the media, in the TV shows,
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  with drag racing and the rest of it, they're obsessed with it.
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  And Hollywood has made countless drag movies.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  Even if they're not popular, they keep force-feeding them.
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  And I just keep wondering what's going on
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  without even looking for it when you're on the Internet
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  or your iPhone surfing.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  It gets shoved and shoveled at you.
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  And you ask yourself, why is this so popular?
[45:43.000 --> 45:46.000]  And the answer is, it isn't.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  But in the minds of the elite, this must be
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  one of their other favorite fetishes.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  Now, that said, I've seen a lot of weird bold photos of her
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  and I've done the Google searches with the photo
[45:59.000 --> 46:01.000]  to see if it's Photoshopped, photo search it and see,
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  no, there it is, Getty Images, or there it is,
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  Associated Press Image, and it really is a bulge.
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  And then you see dozens and dozens and dozens
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  and then medical doctors come out and say,
[46:11.000 --> 46:16.000]  look at her head, look at her hands, look at her shoulders.
[46:16.000 --> 46:19.000]  She has the autonomy, the Adam's apple,
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.000]  everything of a man.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  And then a lady was at Harvard last week,
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  I have the article right here out of Daily Mail,
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  let's move, Malia Obama checks into Harvard dorm
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  with help Barack Obama and Michelle.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  I mean, you've got him in different videos saying,
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  Michael and I, and we use shorter clips of the video
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  we put out there going, oh, he doesn't really mean his wife.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  No, no, in the full clips he did,
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  we're gonna add those in the links below.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  It's the number six biggest video on YouTube right now.
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  I noticed when I saw it the night before
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  it had already been taken down.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  We hadn't posted it, somebody else had,
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  it had been taken down.
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.000]  We had millions of views in just a few hours.
[47:02.000 --> 47:05.000]  So we reposted it under fair use, analyzing it saying,
[47:05.000 --> 47:08.000]  we're not against trannies, we're not against any of the stuff.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  Even though it's our free speech to be against
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  whatever you want to do, I'm not, I don't hate them.
[47:13.000 --> 47:15.000]  I'm tolerant, I'm not out to get them.
[47:15.000 --> 47:18.000]  I just don't want our kids being sexualized by anybody.
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  So I put out the headline, is this the final proof
[47:21.000 --> 47:23.000]  Michelle Obama is a man?
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.000]  Question mark, because hundreds of publications are saying,
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  Alex Jones says she's a man.
[47:32.000 --> 47:38.000]  Alex Jones says he has all this proof
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  and then they edit the video to not show the proof
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  and they edit the video to not show
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  where I've put out the evidence
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  and they edit the video to leave out something even bigger.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  Nowhere in any of these articles
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  showing you how controlled corporate media is.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Hundreds of them this morning.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  Do they say Joan Rivers said it
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  and that's how I start the video.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  We took the video that they've basically tried to ban,
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  put it into a larger context, news piece I did
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  and showed Joan Rivers right before she died mysteriously
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  in a medical accident saying,
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  oh, we already have a gay president.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  Michelle and Obama, you know, she's a tranny
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  and she had dinner with them.
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  She was friends with them
[48:20.000 --> 48:23.000]  and then she died because they didn't want her doing further interviews.
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  So I look at it and I just say there's no way they're that bold.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  There's no way that they're that crazy.
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  There's no way that this is actually happening
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  and then I see this video
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  shot by a Democrat by one of their fans.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  We've got the ladies page right here.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  She shoots the video.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  Sandy Alton Sennett
[48:42.000 --> 48:47.000]  and she shoots it of Michelle and Obama coming out
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.000]  or Michael as he calls her, he, whatever it is.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  She, she mail, whatever.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  And she's walking down
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  and this is the raw video off her Facebook.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  They haven't taken that one down, just the folks that pointed it out.
[49:03.000 --> 49:10.000]  And man, folks, it's clearly either a real male member
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  or it's an artificial one
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  and they're trying to basically troll folks.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  This could be a Psyop.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  They've done this before
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.000]  and but it's either a very elastic rubber false member
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  or it's the real deal because she adjusted just like a man does.
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  It's incredibly obvious
[49:29.000 --> 49:35.000]  and it looks like there's about an eight inch rubber prosthesis.
[49:35.000 --> 49:38.000]  I mean, look, they put in the Harvard Law Review
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  that he edited that he was born in Kenya.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  He said, I was born in Kenya.
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  They have Michelle saying he was born in Kenya.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  We took the bait. He was born in America, folks.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  They put that out
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  literally on purpose themselves.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  And we later confirmed it.
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  He was from Hawaii, Frank Marshall Davis.
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  He admitted it in his book.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  He said, I used to stay with Frank.
[49:57.000 --> 50:00.000]  You know, Frank, my grandfather was best friends with him.
[50:00.000 --> 50:01.000]  It was like he was my dad.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  And then it turns out that was his dad.
[50:03.000 --> 50:06.000]  And we have the photos and everything, a famous communist.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  So of course they had to create the Kenya thing
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  because she did marry guys as part of the deal
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  to bring folks in as a side business.
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  You know, these other men that she would marry
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  to get them into the country on visas.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  That's a well-known scam.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  It was part of her CIA cutout.
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  So I'm going to come back and play you this footage
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  that they don't want you to see,
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  or maybe they do want you to see.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  I don't know anymore, but look.
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  I mean, whatever pants fell down
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and then she had a huge, you know what, hanging down.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  I mean, either it's a fake thing in her pants
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  or it's real because it's not Photoshop
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  and it's not fake video.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  We've blown up the video layers.
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  We know how to look for the pixelation, the manipulation.
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.000]  It's not.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.000]  She has a sausage, a cucumber,
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  but it's giggling around.
[50:54.000 --> 50:55.000]  It's flopping around.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  I mean, it looks like she's packing.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's a no-brainer.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine,
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA,
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  and other endocrine disruptors,
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.000]  Get the original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration,
[51:15.000 --> 51:16.000]  Big Berkey.

[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  Any time, any place, any way,
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  At home, at work, in the car, on smartphones,
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.000]  That makes choosing radio is a place to advertise your business.
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  One of the best decisions you can make.

[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  Easy, affordable, effective.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  It's been said, any society has only three missed meals away from chaos.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  Those times may be near.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  Think about it, our country faces multiple terrorist threats
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[52:14.000 --> 52:18.000]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  from a single cyber attack.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises,
[52:23.000 --> 52:27.000]  the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.

[54:02.000 --> 54:05.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Chelsea Clinton.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  Good myths in the WikiLeaks.
[54:07.000 --> 54:10.000]  They robbed 97% of the money from the Haitians and killed people.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  She says we're killing people.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  She's saying that Michelle Obama or Michael Obama
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  is everything this site will never be.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  Honorable, brave, beloved, beautiful.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  Don't need to watch an awful video to know that.
[54:22.000 --> 54:25.000]  Ha! This is video shot by one of their fans
[54:25.000 --> 54:28.000]  where she looks like she either got a rubber snake in her pants
[54:28.000 --> 54:33.000]  or she is, could be a major porn star in Hollywood, okay?
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  And I'm not putting trannies down.
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  So here's the deal.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  Joan Rivers said this and died.
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  And none of the media will even cover that she had dinner with the Obamas.
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  She was friends with them and she was all for it saying it's great
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  that she was gay and that he's got a tranny wife.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  And it's a big joke on America.
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  And then she died.
[54:54.000 --> 54:57.000]  But they don't ever show in the reports that I'm saying Joan Rivers said it.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I was never sure. It was kind of a joke to me.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  I never created it.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  But now there's footage they're trying to pull off the internet
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  where I guess she didn't tuck it between her legs or whatever,
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  you know, like right out of silence the lambs.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  It rubs the lotion on the skin.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Oh, you know, I'd like me a little bit.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  Look, see it for yourself.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  Here's the footage. It's going to go to number one on YouTube.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  If they try to take it down, you know, it's the end of free speech
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  because I'm covering what people were already covering.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  And here comes Michelle Obama walking like a man,
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  looking like a linebacker, way bigger than Obama, big hands, big head.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  And man, I guess she's a devil then.
[55:33.000 --> 55:36.000]  Maybe it's a forked tail that's six inches long.
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  That's it. Michelle Obama's a devil.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  I've already made the joke about Obama, but maybe it isn't.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  Maybe it's a little forked tail.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.000]  You decide what is this hanging between her legs,
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  jiggling and flopping around. Here it is.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  Slow down.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  She's adjusting it?
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  I mean, I've seen men my whole life, myself adjust their packages.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  So, I were talking about this, folks, but they're bringing it up.
[56:01.000 --> 56:12.000]  Yeah, she's got it. Get that gun in line there.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  Since the early days of the Obama administration,
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.000]  citizens across the board have studied videos and photos
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  of Michelle Obama and said, that is a man.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  And even Obama has called her over and over again, Michael.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  But new shock footage has emerged that's being censored off the Internet
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  as fast as you can upload it.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  I'm here to ask you, what do you think?
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  Because in America, it's still okay to ask questions.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  After all, there are many questions surrounding the president's past.
[56:46.000 --> 56:52.000]  And now people are starting to question the sexual orientation of the First Lady.
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  Alex Jones has a special report on that.
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.000]  But first, here's what Joan Rivers had to say to kick the controversy into the mainstream.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  You know Michelle is a trans.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.000]  A transgender. We all know.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Oh my gosh.
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  Is this final proof that Michelle Obama is a man?
[57:16.000 --> 57:19.000]  That's what the headlines are reading across the Internet.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  I first saw this headline last night.
[57:22.000 --> 57:29.000]  And since then, the video has gone super viral across YouTube platforms.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  I'm going to come back in the next segment, play the rest of it.
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.000]  And again, they've caught people smuggling over the border,
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  parrot snakes in their bras, in their pants.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  One time my mom was flying back from Belize.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  And in the bathroom when they landed in Houston,
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  a lady pulled a parrot out of her shirt that was tied up.
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  I'm not kidding this happened.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  And she comes running out going, David, David, do I tell customs they got a parrot?
[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  But I went, yeah, I walked over and told them somebody just came out of there with a parrot.
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.000]  But seriously, maybe, maybe she dropped a little bag of jewelry in
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  and that could kind of jiggle around a bunch of jewelry.
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  I'm serious. I'm not sure she's a man.
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  They always say I'm definitive. I created it.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  No, Joan Rivers said it.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  And then she was dead.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  They said she's in there for a regular medical deal.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  Like somebody poured gasoline down her throat.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  They said the technicians don't even know what happened.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  Just fire was shooting out of her mouth.
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  Like she was a dragon.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  Truth is way stranger than fiction. I don't know what happened.
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  All I know is she's got a rubber Halloween snake in her pants then.
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  Okay, fine. She's not a man.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  She carries a rubber snake around in her pants.
[58:36.000 --> 58:38.000]  That's much more plausible.
[58:38.000 --> 58:40.000]  And she just has big shoulders, big head, big hands.
[58:40.000 --> 58:45.000]  Obama reportedly, you know, like $65,000 of succulent hot dogs will ever do his house.
[58:45.000 --> 58:49.000]  It's just in the WikiLeaks though, succulent hot dogs and special sauces.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.000]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[58:57.000 --> 59:02.000]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[59:11.000 --> 59:15.000]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[59:15.000 --> 59:21.000]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[59:28.000 --> 59:34.000]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[59:34.000 --> 59:40.000]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[59:43.000 --> 59:46.000]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands
[59:46.000 --> 01:00:11.000]  and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Is this the final proof Michelle Obama is a man?
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Or is she just smuggling stuff in her pants that looks like a snake?
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  Here it is.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  The proof that Michelle Obama is a man?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  That's what the headlines are reading across the internet.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  I first saw this headline last night and since then,
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  the video has gone super viral across YouTube and other platforms.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  The problem is channels posting it are being deleted.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Now, I'm not saying that Michelle Obama is a tranny.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  And I don't hate trannies.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  But we have famous photos of her where it appears she has a large bulge in her pants.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  And we have Joan Roberts, who was a big fan of gays and trannies
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  and everything else saying, hey, we've already got our first gay couple
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  because Michelle is a tranny.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  She died a month or so later in a freak medical mishap.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  And then you expand and look at it.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  The fact that in his own book that Obama wrote about growing up,
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  he talked about being raised by a tranny nanny in Indonesia.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  And so you ask yourself, there's this media obsession with trannies
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  and Michelle keeps in public photos and videos
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  to appear to have a very large penis in her pants or shoulders are wide.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Her face is very, very masculine.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  She looks like a tranny.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  And so you ask yourself, are the children a beard for Obama?
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  And of course, Michelle Obama or Michael Obama, as he's called her in two different videos.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  Here is some of the past photos that got people thinking.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  And then Joan Rivers saying indeed that Michelle is a tranny.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  And let's be clear.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  The media has said that I am the progenitor or the creator of this theory.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  I am not the creator of this theory.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  This has been on the Internet since the campaign,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  since he kept calling her Michael in all these press conferences and events.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  How do you call your wife Michael when it's Michelle?
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Men and women of the finest military in the world.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Most of all, Admiral Mullen.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  Deborah.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  Michael and I. Michael and I. Michael and I.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Is that anything scary?
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  You know, uh, well, when Michelle's mad.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  When Michelle's mad.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  My Michael. Oh, my Michael.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  He killed a hot dog.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Ms. Rivers, how are you?
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  You made, you made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  Is this like a, is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I am so excited.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  And I should do very well because I don't show it.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  And do you think that the country will see the first,
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  We already have it with Obama.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  So let's just calm down.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Got it.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  You know Michelle is a trans.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  A transgender. We all know.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000]  Oh my gosh.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  It's okay.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  We've blown up this video.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  We have enhanced this video just shot days ago as they were visiting one of their daughters at college.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  And it doesn't look like a cell phone in her pants, in her, in her, in her dress.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  It doesn't look like it looks like a cucumber or something right out of the movie spinal tap.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  So you watch this, you decide their public figures,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Joan Rivers, who was friends with them, said this and died mysteriously.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  And it just makes you ask, is anything we're told true anymore?
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Because we've watched the footage.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  We've blown it up.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  It does not appear to be manipulated or photoshopped.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  It appears from the video layers with our experts looking at it to be real.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  That's the only question we're asking is, why did Joan Rivers die?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Right after she questioned this and what does this footage mean to you?
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  Oh my gosh.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back, but major wardrobe malfunction there.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And again, they use this for blackmail when they put people like this in the White House.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Total control.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  They basically bring down the U.S. anytime they want, bringing this secret out.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  That's why they arranged this and did this.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  And of course, there's a lesser magic joke on everyone.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  And it would be strange, indeed, if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax,
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  peppermint oil, iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.

[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  Watch me, watch me, I got it, watch me, I got it, hey!
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  I got something that makes me want to shout, I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  I don't care how big you are, I don't care how high you think you are.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  If you come for me, I'm coming for you.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  And so, whether it's the President of the United States of America or any of his cabinet,
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  we will say to them, we will resist you.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  We will not allow you to damage this country in the way that you're doing.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  We will not allow you to take us backwards.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Not only will we resist you, we will impeach you, Mr. President.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  And so, I know that you are as inspired as I am this evening.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  I want you to know that I said and I'll say it over and over again, reclaiming my time.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Now here's Pelosi, even stupider.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  How could the park service justify denying that organization their free speech rights?
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  Because the Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolves in a crowded theater.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  If you are endangering people, then you don't have a constitutional right to do that.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  It's yell fire in a theater and you can't have pre-constraint on speech saying you think someone's going to yell fire.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  If someone says, we're going to go have a rally at the Capitol to gather a group together to blow up the legislature,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  then you have admitted criminal intent to commit criminal acts and organize criminal acts and engage in terrorism
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  to influence the political process and then you get swat-teamed and then you get sent to a supermax prison.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  Whereas I didn't like the alt-right group that was out there and either to Jack Pasobit or Mike Cernovich or anybody.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  You know, we've been invited to speak at all those and we said, no, it's stupid.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  We want to be inclusive, not the Democratic Party that's all about division while claiming they're trying to stop it.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  But white nationals, KKK, they've got their rights.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  And so now because Charles Bartley came out and said, I don't care about those idiots.
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  I got my own life. I'm successful. Screw them. I'm not giving attention to a bunch of losers.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  They went, oh, you're a white supremacist. They're calling George Foreman names because he likes Trump.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  It's just, it's insane. It's totally out of control, but this is the desperate Democratic Party that is now saying they're going to have a house commission
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  with Pelosi and with Maxine Waters on it. I'm not kidding. It was on CNN this morning.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  They're going to be on this commission about Trump's mental health.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  These women, if you watch their press conferences, it's the best unintentional comedy until you realize how dangerous they are
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  because they're calling for, you know, to stop Putin and his attack on Korea as if there's not a North or South
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  or as if Putin's not involved in Korea except for a small border.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  That's how great, as he goes, well, Aleppo in Korea, lady, Aleppo is in Syria.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  That's the Middle East, not the Far East, not South Central Asia, Southeast Asia.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  These people, how about we have the congressman from Georgia? Watch his name.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  The one that Hank, whatever, the one that thinks, Hank Johnson, the one that thinks Guam is floating.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  And the admiral thought he was joking and he wasn't joking. He said, well, if we put too many troops on the island, will it not capsize?
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Fancy word you learned. The sailboat, you know, floating.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  Talk about twilight zone. Meanwhile, you have conversations with Trump or you see him working 18 hours a day.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  It's like, how is this guy hardly ever stumble his words, totally focused, incredible memory, like a machine, finishing your sentences for you.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  He's a superman compared to these people.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  Putin, Aleppo, North Korea, Putin, the technical Korea, and George W. Bush as president, and the islands are floating.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And you ask yourself, who is running things?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  Meanwhile, results, economy exploding, all these amazing things happening, and they're just trying to block it with big central banks and open sex going,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  the economy's going under, the economy's going under, we're raising interest rates, Obamacare's going to stay, you're not getting tax cuts.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Please, economy fall.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  And the left cheerleading, yeah, depression, get Trump. I mean, talk about loving your servitude, talk about hating yourself, talk about mind control, talk about a cult of idiots.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  And then meanwhile, our story is up on DrudgeReport.com, Hurricane Harvey hysteria, consumers, customers fight as stores sell out of water.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  A Don Salazar article, Storm Aspected Upgrade, now to category three, which it was.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  It's Harvey to make landfall tonight, bringing 40 inches of rain, they get three inches in Houston, they flood.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  Worst case scenario, looms for Texas with Hurricane Harvey. Storm of the decade, perfect conditions can make Harvey the strongest hurricane hit the U.S. in 12 years,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  as Texans are told to get out of dodge before 130-mile-an-hour winds and rain cause alligator-infested floods.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  It's actually true. Hurricane Harvey could be the flooding disaster as the storm stalls over Texas.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  There is a creek on a place we used to live in that when it rained three or four inches, it would flood right up the house.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  I got to, you know, get with my ex-wife on the phone and just say, you need to, she still lives there, you need to get to high ground.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  I mean, I'm sure she is. This is just absolutely out of control. I mean, there will be deaths from this, you can believe it.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  And so everybody should get to higher ground and pray, pray for folks who are in Texas. And Trump is on it, talking to the governor, got emergency response,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  National Guard, federal trips already getting ready to go in, and it's, he failed, he failed, he failed.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  Remember during the campaign, he went to Louisiana, Mississippi when it got hit, and Obama wouldn't, they just don't even care.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  But they made a big deal out of Bush not doing enough. Brownie, you're doing a good job and all that.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And I don't think Bush did a good job. The point is, Obama did ten times worse, but it's okay.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  Because it's all this upside down idiot standard. And you watch, Trump's going to fly down in the aftermath.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  That won't be enough. Everything is upside down world. Joining us, though, is Jack Pasobic.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  For the rest of the hour, riding shotgun, if you want to see what Leigh Ann Mackadoo.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Jack Pasobic's incredible naval intelligence. Didn't make a big deal out of that.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  They're trying to get him out of the Navy now. Headlines across the nation last week.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  How dare the president retweet Jack Pasobic, a journalist, who didn't tell us he was in naval intelligence.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  And he needs to be thrown out of the Navy and lose his security clearance.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Because, you know, the crazy president likes you. That's like working for a foreign spy or something to have the president like you.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  That's illegal. Again, upside down world. And then he ran the headline on August 4th. We had him on White House to Staffers.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  If you like Info Wars or Milo, you're fired. One other thing, General Kelly is restricting all the knowledge getting in.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  And then they go on today and admitting in Politico, New York Times, Washington Post, and admitting everything that Jack Pasobic broke.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  But what happens when you're right over and over and over again about when somebody's going to be out, like the Chief of Staff or the White House spokesman,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  and you're right to the day, and you're right on things that were things because you actually have real sources,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  which they admit in Politico and Reuters, Pasobic and Mike Cernovich and myself and Roger Stone have real sources.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  But to the general public, they say, oh, they're fake news. Don't listen to them. But now they've got to admit it.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  So they don't want people that they admit have the real intel to let the president know.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  Oh, by the way, the former deputy director of the CIA went on CNN and said they're preparing to kill you.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  Oh, and sir, here's a report where Clapper says they're preparing to forcibly remove you.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  And here's another person from Congress saying they're shopping it, saying Republicans better get in line or we'll kill you too.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  It goes like this. This is going to get real hairy. We don't want a civil war. He's mentally ill.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  And you need for yourself and your family to decide to make the right decision when this happens.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  All you got to do is keep your mouth shut. I've gotten the phone calls.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  So that's how this works. And they're playing hardball, folks. This is a revolutionary war we're in.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  So Jack Pasobic, everybody should follow you on Twitter. Everybody should support you.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  One of the main Trump groups obviously there to help get Trump elected.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  Trump loves you. The enemy hates that. Jack Pasobic said this is for Trump.com.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000]  Everybody should just absolutely thank you for the great work you do there in D.C.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  You were right again on target because you weren't right. You were reporting.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  It isn't a prediction. You have sources that were told this by people that formerly worked for Soros.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  That's Soros people. And of course they've got the president so isolated because they're scared he's going to learn all this.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  Jack.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:31.000]  Yeah, Alex, that's what they're doing. They're trying to stifle the president's information flow
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000]  because they know that when Donald Trump gets the information,
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000]  they know that when Donald Trump has all access to information at his fingertips,
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.000]  that he will inevitably make the right decision as he's done time and time again.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  Well, I heard about this nearly a month ago, Alex, and I came on. We talked about it.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  I said, Alex, my sources in the White House are telling me,
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  Jana Toner, these people, John DeStefano, they're going around to the staff
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  and they're telling all the staff stop reading info wars.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  If you like info wars on your Facebook, if you put it up on your social media,
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  they're scouring everyone's accounts to see if anyone's posted any articles.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  And if you had that, you were fired. You were immediately gone.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]  So they started at the lower levels and now they're working their way up.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  See, they worked their way in. They started there a few months ago,
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  and that's where we first got the indications of it because I know these people.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  I see these people. I'm friends with some of these people on occasion.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  I'm not going to say who, though, because I don't want to get them fired.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000]  I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. I'm just telling you what's going on.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  And I think that the American people have a right to know this.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  And now it seems that they're actually funneling that information from President Trump.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  Meanwhile, we've got people like Gary Cohn, who's now going out and bashing Trump
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000]  in the mainstream press. So what remains to be seen is,
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  does the president even know that this has happened because have they kept that off of his desk?
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  The great news is they can keep control of what goes into his office,
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  but they can't keep control of what he sees on TV and what he sees on his cell phone,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  where he still has Twitter, he still has his personal social media,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  and his legions, his millions of fans on social media, on Twitter.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.000]  And that's why Twitter, admittedly, for three months, blocks all the positive stuff.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  But then we got word to him about that. He learned to then go into the feeds.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  And I don't want to get into inside baseball.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  We also obviously got Trump the quotes and where they said they're going to kill him.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  He didn't know that. So now, obviously, the Pentagon was already aware of this.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  Now Trump's ready for that. I mean, they just can't. We're like, sir, they're preparing to kill you.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000]  Here's what they're saying. And here's the COG plan. And now we're taking action.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:35.000]  Yeah, they know that what we're doing is trying to expose them for stopping our movement,
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  for stopping the movement of the New American Revolution, as many people are calling it,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  the New American independence movement. And they don't want the president to be associated with that.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  They want him to go right along with the new concern.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  And they don't want minorities who are the majority to have the new birthright and be part of this
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  because they are America.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:25.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  After being sold out for months, our best selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at m4store.com.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  The Atlantic Monthly, the same folks that have been organizing a military coup using Continued Government against the president, they have come out and said the eclipse was racist because it went over areas that were not predominantly minority.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.880]  minority. I'm not kidding. So how long do they say Harvey is racist because it's
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:29.040]  gonna hit an area with a lot of white folks, a lot of Hispanics, but also a lot
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:33.300]  of black folks. A lot of black folks on the coast of Texas, and I guess they got
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:37.520]  good taste. It's, you know, Texas is a nice place to live and in Houston. So, you
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.500]  know, they said the eclipse was racist. They were serious. They want to just foam
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.280]  in everything where all you see is racism, not opportunity.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.040]  Jack Pasobic, how long until they say that Hurricane Harvey is racist? I'm
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.680]  surprised they haven't yet, Alex. It's almost like it's right on cue for them.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.360]  They're a little behind. I guess the mainstream media is still catching up to
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:59.240]  the news cycle, but clearly they're gonna call this racist. They're gonna view
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:03.600]  everything through the lens of race. And I've been talking to my contacts in DC
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.040]  and we figured out what essentially the main goal of all of this is. Their end
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.080]  state, Alex, is to take out the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Declaration of
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.360]  Independence. We saw a CNN panel just yesterday talking about Washington and
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.800]  Jefferson. These are people that founded our country. They founded our way of
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.160]  That's right. Once you get one statue, they all fall like dominoes. Then it's the
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.440]  Declaration. It's the Bill of Rights. It's the Constitution. All those evil rights,
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.960]  let's get rid of them because they're racist. Exactly. So, when we talk about
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.880]  freedom of speech and they're trying to block freedom of speech, Nancy Pelosi
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.240]  calling it Wolf in the Theater. I'm not sure maybe she was talking about Wolf
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:46.040]  Blitzer. We have to ask him. But yeah, if I see Wolf in the Theater, I better not
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  say hi. Mr. Blitzer, excuse me. So, the real goal for all of this, take out the
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.000]  Constitution, get away from those things to discredit them the same way they're
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.560]  trying to discredit the president. But at the same time, they're also using
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:04.160]  loopholes to get around the way the Constitution has our democratically
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.720]  elected president. They didn't get enough votes. They were counting votes for
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.320]  impeachment last week. They were trying to put together Democrats and
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.120]  Republicans. They came up short. That's why they're trying to push this fake
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.800]  mental illness, mental health kind of statement that's going on, because that
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:22.840]  puts it under the 25th Amendment. And under the 25th Amendment, the vote
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.680]  actually comes not from Congress, but from the cabinet. And by the way, we'll
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.080]  talk about this more in the next segment. I want to get back to their plan to
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:33.680]  overthrow Trump in your intel, because I know it's always incredibly spot-on.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:39.240]  They are openly pushing for the 25th Amendment. And Roger Stone allowed me, I
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:42.520]  should say, to tell where he learned that. Remember back in May, he said, the
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:45.560]  Russian irritable Peter out, then it'll be racism, because they were already doing
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.560]  that before. They'd find some excuse, which they did. And then it's going to be
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:55.400]  that he's mentally ill, early onset of Alzheimer's, early onset dementia. He
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.720]  didn't just pull that out of a hat. He talked to major reporters that were in
[01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.320]  editorial meetings at the highest levels of some of the biggest papers. They were
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.760]  given talking points and told the whole rollout. That's how criminal this is, how
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:13.400]  made up it is. Yeah, Alex, it's like they know exactly what narrative is in the
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.480]  line. So they just move on one, they move on the other, they keep it going until
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.360]  that one completely peters out. And then you notice that whenever another one of
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:24.800]  these dies, another one of these false narratives, there's no apologies. There's
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.560]  no retractions. There's no, Oh, I'm sorry, we got this wrong. We're issuing a
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:33.000]  correction. No, they just move on to the next one. So one day he's a Russian. The
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.520]  next day he's an agent of the Nazi party of America. The next day he's mentally
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:43.040]  unfit for office. It's literally 1984. But instead of it taking place over a
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.760]  period of weeks, months and years, it's instantaneous. It's that instantaneous
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.320]  shift. And they think that because of social media, American attention spans
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.480]  aren't as fast as they used to be. They're hoping that people aren't paying
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.880]  attention, but they're not. And by the way, they're popping them out and telling me
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.720]  the leftists are all over Twitter now. I guess Paul Watts is doing a story because
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:07.320]  they just see Florida as racist because it went 51% for Trump or whatever, or
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.480]  52%. And they see Texas that way. So they don't understand that it's also close
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:15.440]  to half Democrats. They're calling for all of our deaths saying Texas and
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.720]  Florida as entities are like creatures and need to be killed down with them all
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:26.360]  drown them all. America so many rednecks as is. Yes, Jesus, cleanse Texas and
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.040]  Florida. Show your wrath to all these racist Trump supporters. I mean, it's
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.840]  just crazy. They're insane. It isn't even hyper partisanship anymore, Alex. You
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:40.480]  never hear stories about, oh, you know, we want these people to be out of office
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.120]  or because we disagree with their ideas. They're calling for destruction. They're
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:48.440]  calling for death. They're calling for agitation. They're calling for they're
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:53.400]  using listen to the hurricane is some giant destroying monster attacking
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:58.320]  Texas with a big KKK add on. Again, they see race everywhere. Hurricane killed
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.600]  them. Oh, it's a white child when they seal you website races. The halls named
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:07.680]  Lynch ban it. These are completely insane people. They did this during
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.640]  Katrina. They said George W. Bush steered it into Katrina or steered
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.840]  Katrina to New Orleans because it was the majority black. I mean, this is how
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:20.160]  people on that side think. And then they blame me for that because I just had
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:23.920]  weather weapons experts on talking about World War, you know, Korea and
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.440]  Vietnam and weather weapons. And they misappropriated that to me. It's it's
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:31.960]  insane. Jack the subjects are guests. We're gonna talk about the ongoing soft
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:37.240]  coup that's now gotten hot. Bubbles are forming at the bottom of the bowl of the
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:41.160]  pan. I mean, they are moving. They mean business. What do we do to stop them? We
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.880]  can beat them again just like in the election. And Lee and Mac are just
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:49.400]  coming up. Stay with us on the march. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and the
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:59.920]  GCN radio network police departments across the country are now using an
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:05.560]  invasive surveillance tool called sting rays, which use cell phone towers to
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:11.960]  intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants. The technology comes
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:17.040]  courtesy of the FBI who have forced our nation's police departments into signing
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.760]  nondisclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:26.680]  technology. Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our fourth amendment
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.160]  and they have no legal authority for warrantless sting ray spying, where we
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:35.840]  now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:41.240]  people who are not even suspected of any crimes. Once again, more evidence that
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.840]  the police state isn't coming. It's already here. This is Darren McBreen and
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.680]  I invite you to join the resistance info wars.com.

[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.360]  organic mustard seed. The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:26.080]  well known from supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.600]  production and eyesight. Bio truth selenium is also the perfect super
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:33.840]  charger and survival shield x2 nascent iodine as both help support a healthy

[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:57.840]  That's infowarslife.com. We've taken thousands of years of known research and
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.480]  put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.280]  best systems that God gave us to mother nature to detoxify the body. That's why
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.440]  I'm introducing Z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:16.240]  the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.600]  associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:24.240]  classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:28.360]  over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:32.280]  comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You want to yourself, you want to
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:36.040]  your family and you owe it to the future of this country in the world that

[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:45.400]  need you the remnant of America to reignite those brush fires the next
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:48.880]  level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.080]  your prayers together we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.680]  bodies with Z Shield and infowarslife.com.
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:10.840]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the G.C.N. radio
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:21.000]  network. It's illustrated very very well in a Charlton Heston film from the 1950s
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.160]  documenting the historical life of L Sid that marked the beginning of the
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:33.000]  colonial or Reconquista of Spain from the Islamic Moors of North Africa and I'm
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.240]  certainly not comparing myself to L Sid far from it but the globalists have
[01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:44.640]  chosen me after Trump as the symbol they want to destroy to try to kill the
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:49.320]  nationalist reawakening movement because they fear us because we're inclusive
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.160]  we're open they fear Roger Stone because he's inclusive and open he's trying to
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.400]  get Trump to decriminalize marijuana we win the whole thing if he does that just
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.680]  do it he has no idea how that will get the leftist to finally wake up a lot of
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.720]  them and that was Trump's inclination during the campaign they hate us because
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.760]  they really know they tap our phones they know we're not racist they know we
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:13.520]  really want to bring people together they know we're fans of humanity and they
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.160]  know we're fearless because we realize we can't be slaves we can't live on our
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.440]  knees because we'll get killed anyways it's not live on your knees or die on
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:28.400]  your feet it's live on your feet maybe die on your knees wish you die a thousand
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.720]  times as they say before you finally get it uh-uh when I get concerned about
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:38.200]  something I go on the attack and listeners need to follow us on real
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:40.800]  Alex Jones they need to they need to like us on the Facebook channels you
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.280]  need to spread our videos our articles they block us auto-sharing stuff to
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:49.680]  people but they can't stop you from sharing videos and sharing articles and
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.520]  getting them out to people and sharing info wars.com forward slash show and
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:57.320]  telling folks about local stations we're on or telling stations thank you for
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:02.360]  carrying the show and tithing not to some big corrupt church but to a little
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.960]  church that tells the truth or to the local radio station or sign up for
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:10.640]  auto-shipping at the products at infowarstore.com because we're in the
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.160]  eye of the storm here and we're trying to stay in the eye where it's calm with
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:22.240]  all this around us and to be as peaceful as doves and wise as serpents as Moses
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.080]  said and trying to really do the right thing trying to be honorable trying to
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.400]  always tell the truth trying to really take action and not squander the
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:36.800]  position we're in so when I say the enemy has chosen me as a champion it's
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.000]  like in the old days when two kingdoms were about to fight a lot of times they
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.280] 'd send the king's son or or somebody else's their champion to fight the other
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.440]  person's champion so that they didn't have to go to battle and destroy each
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.880]  other with irreconcilable differences and so the globalists have chosen
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:59.960]  Trump because he is our champion and they also want to destroy any of the
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.320]  people that are carrying his sword for him and giving it to him when he gets on
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.720]  his horse anybody that dares support him like a Jack Pasobic or a Roger Stone or
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.160]  Mike Cernovich or a Matt Drudge they're going after all of his supporters so no

[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.960]  chance I mean this is a mission where you're 5050 you're gonna die but listen

[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.880]  understand but you should try to find the next best thing is some of the
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.000]  Himalayan salts and sea salts you have to research them have some good iodine in
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.040]  them and so that's an inexpensive way to get it but or again support us we
[01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:57.800]  support you and I'm not complaining get to understand I'm mad at myself I don't
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.360]  have enough energy it'll be 10 o'clock at night and I'm calling people saying
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.840]  we're going back out of the office I got to do this report and it's because I
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:07.080]  know this is life and death I'm in a fight I can't let these people win we're
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.880]  bringing in Leanne Leanne McAdoo right to shotgun with myself and
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:12.840]  Pesovic I didn't intend this to happen today with the two together but it's
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.000]  kind of a nice mix we'll get her take on this whole situation what's happening
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  worldwide but Jack Pesovic you were trying to get to some points right as we
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.920]  went to break dealing with how high the stakes are what the next move is what
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.680]  the next attack is they're everywhere saying they're getting ready to kill
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.280]  him they're saying he's mentally ill they're saying this new commission with
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.080]  Pelosi and all them totally doddering to run a commission about how he's got
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:40.560]  Alzheimer's I know they're trying to look confident to their own people to make
[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:45.080]  people desert Trump by the threats of violence both public and private with
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:49.120]  the entire MSM calling for violence against Trump supporters the question
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.840]  is have I judged America right does America take this as an insult and is
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.040]  now digging in their heels to be stronger are we really a nation of
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.440]  cowards and that's what this has come down to this is about the test of who we
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.120]  are that a lot of people around me who this has gotten so intense I just say
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.880]  I can't handle it and I understand that but they're not gonna be able to handle
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:11.920]  what comes after it if if this city falls if this Republic goes down true
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:18.800]  haters of us are gonna have an absolute time of wanting to repine but it'll
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.320]  also descend into a true civil war and doesn't the enemy realize that they have
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.240]  stuck their mouth in the head of the lion yeah Alex I let me explain this
[01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:33.640]  commission to you because the 25th amendment if they need the vice
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.760]  president to go along with that to declare the president's unfit for office
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:43.640]  they would need Pence to vote against the president's mental mental capacity
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:47.800]  for office Mike Pence is not going to do that so that is why the Democrats
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:51.840]  under representative Democrat out of Portland representative Earl Blumenauer
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.280]  they've introduced this new oversight commission they're calling it the
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:59.680]  oversight commission on presidential capacity it's a new act that they're
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:04.720]  trying to do as well concurrently with set up this commission to get this act
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:07.960]  pass of course the president is not going to another witch hunt group of a
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.400]  high priesthood around to sit around and say oh he's mentally ill with Pelosi not
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.280]  knowing what her name is as the chairman if Pelosi doesn't know what her name is
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.080]  Maxine Waters doesn't even know what is going on in international affairs he
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:24.920]  thinks Aleppo is on the wrong continent she thinks Putin is building off it has
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.920]  been an office in North Korea she's all over the place but they're gonna talk
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.440]  about this mental capacity meanwhile if you look at a lot of these leaders on
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:35.040]  the specially on the Democrat side we've got octogenarians in charge of the
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:40.160]  party in some cases in the Republican Senate side John McCain of course heart
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:43.240]  goes out to the guy praying for him hope he's hopefully he's healthy but
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.760]  obviously has had some health issues I actually broke the news about John
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:51.320]  McCain's health issues before he came public you broke the brain tumor you
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:55.680]  broke the brain tumor you broke it all that's why you're fake news yeah so I'm
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:00.260]  fake news because I've got sources within these offices I've got sources my
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:04.400]  eyes and ears are all over Capitol Hill they're over the White House I put that
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:08.200]  story out when they said John McCain was just getting eye surgery I said no he
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.200]  actually has serious health issues I've been told it has to do with his brain it
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:16.920]  then came out later they had the brain tumor so this is exactly what came out
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.800]  they were trying to cover it up but then when he had that sort of episode during
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.080]  the Comey hearing when he asked the questions and it went completely off
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:29.080]  the rails that's when they knew they had to come they had to come lose that he
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.400]  said it was up late watching a baseball game and although the diamond backs but
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.920]  I don't think anybody really bought that so when we're talking about mental
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.720]  capacity then fine let's talk about everyone's mental capacity to serve
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.560]  let's take that all the way out I say the same thing when they talk about Russian
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:46.960]  influence in the campaign let's talk about foreign influence let's talk about
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.520]  where money's coming into the Democrat and Republican parties let's talk about
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.880]  these think tanks that are getting money let's talk about Mexican oligarchs
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:59.840]  like Carlos Slim owning the New York Times you have to take Alex their their
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:04.800]  targets their types of attacks on us and you flip it around because they accuse
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:08.120]  us of doing the things that they themselves are doing and that's exactly
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.720]  what it is in this case exactly let's bring in Leanne McAdoo in Full Wars
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:17.240]  calm amazing reporter to get her overall view we haven't even talked yet we're
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:20.080]  always synced up on the topic she wants to get into and I want to get into what
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:26.680]  do you make of this period we're in the craziness just the the over-the-top hate
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.480]  of the left now that is just frothing insanity calling solar eclipse racist
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.920]  where is this going to go Leanne what would you call this period we're in right
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.320]  now oh these are dark days but you know what I think that we're kind of on the
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:43.360]  precipice where the light we're we're just now kind of emerging of so many
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:48.680]  people like yourself myself Jack Pasobic who are being called you know
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:54.920]  traitors or Nazis or we have mental instability when it's clear and it's
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:59.320]  becoming clear by the day that the people who are making those accusations are
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:04.480]  the ones with some serious mental issues that they've been trying to to cover
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.400]  up something I think is really funny right now we've got a C. Bell Edmonds is
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:15.480]  tweeting this out her her site news bud they've done a really good expose talking
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.920]  about the Clinton train paying off the young Turks now you remember the young
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.360]  Turks they were huge Bernie Sanders supporters and once all that came out
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:30.480]  that the DNC was throwing the election the nomination for Hillary Clinton he
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:36.120]  vowed to go after the Democratic Party when Hillary lost well now news bud is
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:42.880]  actually exposing that they the young Turks are paid 20 million dollars by the
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.120]  Clinton train to break that promise and to speak you know positively about
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:52.440]  Hillary Clinton and to actually not go after them so that's incredible who can
[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.720]  you trust the people think that the young Turks are this you know alternative
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:00.080]  site they can go to for truthful news when they're actually being paid by the
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:05.120]  very people they promise their audience that they're gonna go after they're
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:09.040]  actually setting up this I didn't know about this I knew they got money from
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:14.440]  Qatar more than 20 million and from the monster Al Gore and then I know that
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.400]  they were demonizing Hillary properly and then they flipped and suddenly said
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:22.920]  basically you know we love Hillary now that's really a great point and so let's
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.400]  put up this article I guess it's from Newsmax has it and simple Edmonds former
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:30.760]  NSA FBI translator everything she documented ended up coming out that's
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.200]  news bud where media integrity matters I like her because I call her a classical
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:38.640]  liberal she's more of a liberal lady but she exposes the left hand the right
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.840]  Clinton train paid the young Turks 20 million tell us about this land right
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.880]  well you know you have to be a subscriber to news bud to get the entire the
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.960]  entire story there and I highly recommend it they do great reporting there
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.640]  but they follow the money which is you know what you do as an investigative
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.880]  journalist and they found out that of course the preferred method for sort of
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:04.520]  silencing your opposition or getting people to align with you as far as the
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:08.560]  Clintons are concerned is you can just pay them off and what I think is really
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.760]  frustrating is that the young Turks they created this whole movement to try to
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:19.120]  get young progressive Democrats elected in 2018 so this is something that you
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:22.720]  people really need to be looking out for on their local election that's why we
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.920]  keep telling people to go be involved in your local election run for office
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:31.440]  yourself if you can because we do have these young progressive people in the
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.840]  Democratic side being trained by this group that this program the young Turks
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.680]  have started to get into office but they started it and told their audience
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:47.640]  that they're doing this because they were so upset that the DNC threw it for
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:50.720]  Hillary Clinton and they were just gonna you know rally the support of the
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.480]  double battle and I knew about that it was really all the establishment calling
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:57.680]  it grassroots but it was actually to be the Democratic operatives no one is
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:02.080]  more arrogant and greasy than sink turd or whatever his name is and then they
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:05.480]  use the name young Turks is the group that exterminated all the Armenians and
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.200]  other people and they know then he says the Armenian genocide didn't happen
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.400]  because he's proud of the murder of the Christians clearly I mean using the name
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:18.040]  young Turks that's the brown shirts that brought those parties to power and
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:23.040]  launched the persecution in World War one with the Germans of over a million
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:28.000]  Armenians that they killed deader than a hammer the only Christian groups that
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.320]  held on to the Islamic takeover of Constantinople and the rest of Turkey
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:36.680]  hundreds and hundreds of years ago I mean it's just like a guy called the
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:40.960]  young Turks like saying the young Muslim Nazis and we love to kill
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:46.000]  Christians and he's up there all literally just this greasy hateful pig
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.600]  like monster who sits around when you know he attacked me the other day for
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.120]  chasing down some guy cussing at me just saying hey give me an interview going
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:56.480]  you know we don't need to cover him he's so illegitimate no one follows him dude
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:47:00.560]  our website's like 5,000 times bigger than yours we're all over the country we
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:04.040]  advise you name it they're asking the media was asking me today well where
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:08.920]  does Trump get your info and can they I go I go the CIA gives it to him it isn't
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:12.520]  like all these agencies are against Trump Trump goes and meets with the
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.600]  patriots he's got the Pentagon top generals all the people it's it's it
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:20.080]  look and a lot of this again people it's all gonna come out in the wash when
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.120]  you beat these people it's just understand folks it's not just the
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:26.680]  squeaking squawking people on TV saying we're gonna kill Trump from the CIA
[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:29.800]  they're doing this they're doing that because they're so weak and they better
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:33.360]  hope and pray their operation isn't successful because if they launch it
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.560]  it's gonna be a giant bear trap on their heads don't think Trump's just sitting
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:40.760]  there waiting for him to try to kill him and something ain't gonna happen I'm
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:46.320]  telling you we are in a time where things are so incredibly in great and
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:49.400]  it's basically controlled opposition because you have all of these young
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.360]  Bernie Sanders supporters thinking that they're gonna be rallying to this
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.800]  alternative media outlet the young Turks when really they're just controlled
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.280]  opposition they're being paid by the very people that they say they're gonna be
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:05.080]  fighting against and they're asking all their supporters for money in this I
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.840]  mean they're bragging about the fact that we would love George Soros's money
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:13.640]  he's not funding us we welcome it if he wants to fund us you know so they at a
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:17.560]  certain point yes back in the day I think they did some great work but now
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.360]  we've really seen them spiral down it's it's a shame to just where people gonna
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:29.080]  get their their news and information from if Google and these other sites are
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:33.320]  successful in shutting down info let's expand on that let's expand on that
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:36.400]  they're force-feeding when I check the subject about this the new land they are
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:41.880]  force-feeding young Turks through Google they're partnered with them it's true we
[01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:45.080]  do videos in live time showing them attacking us it was down in minutes
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.240]  they were controlling our site and flipping us off with the Google guys
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.560]  going yeah we're in control F you and I went outside to the video about it and
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.120]  then they had to put it back up I mean that's how arrogant they are must be a
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:58.040]  power trip with Google just be able to get it and shut us down whenever you
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.600]  want so they can say that I attacked them when it was really the opposite of
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:06.120]  spitting at me trying to hit me they invited me up and then set me up one of
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.760]  the comedian guys invited me up I guess he didn't know remember Lee and we walked
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.440]  by first I'll be back later they were waving me over so later I just jump up
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:17.680]  as a surprise it's all these little you know shows throughout this parking
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.680]  garage but they'd air-conditioned but but that's the big thing they're trying
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.560]  to silence us while they create all these strawman shows launch a five-day
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.280]  week daily show program about me where a guy plays the part of me but says
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.760]  things I never said about I have all the shows I'm racist you know and they put
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.120]  out the lies so I get physically attacked put some of it let me ask you
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:40.280]  and then Leanne if we got a break how far will this go next because they're
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:44.600]  silencing us or trying to while they attack us everywhere and then don't
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:50.200]  even let us respond no journalistic integrity no nothing because Alex what
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:54.080]  they're doing is they're taking comedy and they're weaponizing it right the
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:58.320]  daily show these other organizations out there they know that they know that
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.720]  info wars is getting bigger they know that it's penetrating through the memes
[01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:07.240]  the songs things are getting out into the mainstream the name of info wars is
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.880]  getting out to mainstream jack masovic leon macadoo alex jones were becoming
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:14.880]  household names believe it or not so they've got to fight the framework battle
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:18.480]  by saying don't listen to those guys those guys are crazy don't listen to those
[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:21.520]  guys those guys are liars you know I watched that clip Alex they said they
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.400]  said you put up lies behind you on the screen there in the studio I see you
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.680]  with the American flag behind you is the American flag a lie according to these
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:34.520]  people they will do anything they can to discredit us to call us names to put
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.800]  us in a framework so people don't believe anything that we say even when
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:42.840]  everything we say is echoed weeks later in the mainstream exactly it's because
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.320]  we're so accurate we're hated because we're studying the globalist arrogant
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.240]  their downfall is they write white papers they've got to communicate to their
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.600]  hundreds of thousands of operatives so that you can always get their actual
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:55.920]  blueprints you might you get a owner's manual to a car and they're telling me
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:00.080]  the car has this engine and the car does this I'm going this isn't you know the
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.920]  blue f-150 450 horsepower you say this is a pinto with this engine I've got the
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.040]  owner's manual and they're like no no no don't look don't look at him and all I'm
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.960]  doing is I'm not smart here's the owner's manual they're gonna do this next
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:17.840]  and then it happens next because we have the owner's manual and you're
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:21.600]  right jack but it's that's partly correct because it you're part of saying
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.560]  it's true but more so it's about intimidating people who don't understand
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:29.040]  being demonized by these criminals is good it's telling everybody else you
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.200]  stick your head up we'll do what we've done to Ron Paul and Rand Paul and Matt
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:37.680]  Drudge and Alex Jones and Jack Pasobic and Leanne McAdoo and everybody else
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.560]  who stands up we're gonna come after you we're gonna lie about you we're gonna
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:46.040]  attack your family and so it's but look they're gonna attack our families if we
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.600]  don't stand up aren't we tired of laying down let's politically stand up and say
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:54.880]  I don't know how this is gonna end but you want to get in the fight you want to
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.360]  swing some fists politically get ready because in the words of Ben Graham it's
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:05.800]  clobbering time Jack Leanne I love Ben Groom on that that's it Alex we're gonna
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.160]  come at them with truth I just did a huge expose on Anna Navarro last night I
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:14.560]  put out how this CNN hack that they put on saying she's a Republican when she
[01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:18.360]  supported Democrat candidates for years she's raised money for the corrupt
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:23.320]  indicted senator Bob Menendez and her father believe it or not was a member
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:27.320]  of the Nicaraguan Contras that were funded by the CIA and she's completely
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.640]  open about all this stuff completely open about it so we're gonna come at them
[01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:36.280]  not with fake news we're not gonna come at them with spurious accusations we're
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:39.720]  gonna do our research we're gonna dig into FEC records and we're actually
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:44.320]  going to use their own tools and tactics to expose them and of course
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:49.080]  Menendez what's he been caught sticking his little cookie jar in we know there
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:53.360]  were some it's all pay-for-play getting people visas that should ever have had
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.680]  visas but it's not just that he's got that he's got that elite taste yeah and
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:03.000]  he's going down because they've got him cold they've got him pretty cold and
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.200]  actually it came down to a tiff between him and Obama and Obama actually
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.040]  threw him under the bus and said you know Bob you've gone so far that I can't
[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:16.480]  even protect you you're done any through into the wolves well that's the thing is
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.440]  what is it about psychopaths and wimps they think they're gonna start fights
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.280]  and push push push and not get pushed back and then when they finally get a
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:26.880]  big hard fist of truth upside their head they're like why did you do that I'm
[01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:31.040]  like you're attacking and hacking at us with hatchets and then we just kicked
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.880]  you upside the head what do you think's gonna happen and then they complain they
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:38.440]  say oh they say we're coming they say we're harassing them they say that we're
[01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:42.280]  we're we're we're taking down them I say excuse me look what you've done to my
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.160]  family look what you've said about me Jake Tapper called me a freak yesterday on

[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.000]  they're trying to ignite a real civil war a race-based civil war it's so sad
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:11.080]  that's why we are trying to have unity and reach out to everybody and just say
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:14.520]  let's come together and see through the scam and then Trump's delivered on the
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.760]  economy the most basic thing something Obama promised he do Trump did it
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:24.040]  already in seven months well you know Alex what I think is really interesting
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:28.720]  is what we have Nancy Pelosi coming out mixing the metaphors where she was
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:32.760]  wanting to say you know you can't shout fire in a crowded theater but she said
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.720]  you can't yell wolf in a crowded theater because she was mixing the metaphor of
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:41.120]  of crying wolf and that's exactly what the left and the Democrats are doing
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.960]  they're crying wolf calling everyone a Nazi everyone a white supremacist and
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:48.920]  it's getting diluted they're really trying to ramp this up thinking it's
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:53.840]  gonna work for them up leading up to 2018 when that's exactly why they lost
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:57.760]  and they've been losing and they're gonna lose again because they are
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:02.720]  diluting their message by continuing to cry wolf and it's just so interesting
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.120]  that that was kind of jumbled up in her her brain that's probably you know
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:09.800]  that's right but don't worry she'll run the commission looking into Trump's
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:13.680]  brain I mean this is a total separation of powers violation let's let's play
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.640]  that that big bad wolf clip here you never cry wolf in a theater
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:23.240]  responsibility how could the park service justify denying that organization
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:28.520]  their free speech rights because the Constitution does not say that a person
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:34.600]  can shout yell wolf in a crowded theater if you are endangering people then
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:39.960]  you're you don't have a constitutional right to do that too there you go so they
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:43.600]  want to put pre-controls on the First Amendment which is no First Amendment at
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:47.960]  all Leigh Ann Jack right well and the thing is is that she's coming out
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.720]  saying that this is gonna be a white supremacist rally coming up in San
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:55.280]  Francisco in Berkeley that's this Patriot Prayer rally it's being put on by
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.200]  someone who that's right even like multi-racial Christians now are white
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:04.240]  supremacists right exactly and it's getting it people are getting sick and
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:07.280]  tired of it but the thing I think is interesting is people in San Francisco
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:12.520]  don't even bother to look into it they're just gonna go and put their pets
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.120]  poop oh yeah I saw that under the Golden Gate Bridge a thousand people it's
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.720]  associated press are gonna show up and have their dogs poop so that so that
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:24.720]  everyone can like walk around in poop and Antifa throws poop at people why are
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.800]  they so sick for something because Alex these people have been sold a bill of
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:36.360]  programming they've been programmed in institutions they've been programmed by
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:41.440]  by mainstream media by television by video games in some cases that they
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.440]  need to hate that they have violence it's like they live all the subtext behind
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:50.040]  popular culture that we see today the violence the guns that are out there
[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:53.680]  they're you know sort of making this stuff feel like this is what you should
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.440]  do what you want to do but then they're also said you can't do this you can't
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:56:58.640]  do this you have to you can't be masculine you have to control that you
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:02.600]  have to put it down and now they turn you loose and say these are the enemies
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:06.560]  these are the people that we need to target these Christians these republic
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:10.400]  and then when I walk down the street I throw coffee on me and scream Nazi and
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.000]  I try to you know hug a black guy he thinks I'm a Nazi and runs off look
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.480]  right here the Guardian turd Reich San Francisco dog owners lay mindful to poo
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:21.960]  for a right-wing rally because I want to be sure if new listeners are tuning in
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:26.920]  on radio that this sounds insane it sounds like we're making all this up
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:32.320]  like Antifa in a new article in a new video has pledged to kill police like
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:36.880]  actual leaders are saying we now are going to shoot cops and then nothing's
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:41.160]  doing I mean that's a conspiracy to keep them at murder murder one they're
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:46.520]  organizing it they're saying kill me and nothing's being done Jack actually what
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.920]  what Nancy Pelosi said is correct but she should have said it regarding Antifa
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:54.320]  she should have said that's true with this first amendment doesn't protect
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:59.000]  groups that are calling for organized destruction chaos in mayhem but the only
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.960]  group in America that I've heard that's calling for nationwide destruction
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.920]  chaos assassination of police officers assassination of the president they've
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:11.240]  been doing it and they've been doing it and they've been doing it they think the
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:14.880]  police when a nationwide kill a couple hundred a day are gonna roll over and go
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.040]  we'll do what you say we'll be liberal we'll let you run our review boards now
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:22.080]  and you know what I mean the cops seem to followers maybe they will and then the
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:26.260]  cops will become the enemy you work for much anti-fuck cop killers I just can't
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:29.120]  believe how far we've come a few five more minutes and then we've got major

[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:34.120]  work what else is on your radar what else is coming up what else is you in
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:41.480]  part to the audience going forward Alex we I want to see more and more number
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:45.560]  one the operations that are done psychologically on our president so now
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:49.480]  that we know they're censoring his information what are they trying to do
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:53.960]  what are they trying to shape his worldview as what are they going to try
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:59.200]  to push the president on and then number two is how do we get information to the
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.920]  president how do we make sure that we're using social media that we're using
[02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:07.200]  other avenues of approach now when I worked in intelligence that's what you
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:10.880]  would do if you had a source if you had a target you would try to say what are
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.360]  the avenues of approach you could use to potentially get to that person get to
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:19.600]  that object that's what we're now looking at different channels to get our
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:23.360]  news to get your news Alex our stories to the president so that he can make
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.400]  these decisions we know that he's right and that's number one number two is who
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:32.840]  is rising up to run against the president in 2020 John Kasich this is
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:36.440]  something I broke a few weeks ago that he was considering it now it's an axios
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:39.640]  now it's political that case it is trying to run potentially as an
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.680]  independent and we noticed that nobody on the Democrat side seems to really be
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.760]  jumping up to say I'm doing it I'm filing nomination petitions against the
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.480]  president to run as a Democrat so I'm very interested to see because Alex
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:56.800]  there's no way they can run on anything they're doing right now they are in total
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.240]  scorched earth mode as a party because that's how badly they were beaten and
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.400]  now they've been exposed as having no idea so I want to see possibly Kamala
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:09.480]  Harris I see that as being one of the rumors that goes around a lot a lot of
[02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:13.600]  people talking about her in DC but I don't know if I see her building out the
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:17.280]  nationwide infrastructure having the note the donor meetings that she be
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.240]  required to have so I'm keeping a very close eye on the DNC and the RNC as
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:26.960]  always Alex to see what they're up to next to stop our president and to stop
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:30.520]  our movement Jack Busseaubeck everybody should follow you on Twitter
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:35.280]  everywhere else thank you so much thank you Leigh Ann that's a good point he
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:42.400]  makes the polls show people aren't into this Russia stuff this race stuff it's
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:46.280]  not working but they just keep pushing it where do you think this is going well
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:50.280]  it's everyone just needs to understand that this is Saul Alinsky rule for
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:54.800]  radicals I mean we have Gary Cohn coming out saying that Trump must do better to
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:59.640]  condemn neo-nazis and white supremacists what more can he do this is the Saul
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:04.720]  Alinsky tactic of picking your target freezing it continuing to hit never
[02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:09.280]  letting down continually keeping your opposition having to defend themselves
[02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:14.440]  against these attacks that have zero basis in reality but as long as Trump is
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:18.960]  being forced to continue condemning neo-nazis I mean he's been they've been
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.120]  forcing him to do this since since before the election and so as long as they
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.760]  can keep him because that's all they have then he can be distracted and you
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:31.040]  know tweet out things that the media can spin out of control he's gonna be
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.600]  distracted from completing his agenda or he's going to allow these other
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.720]  neocons that are have seemed to have been circling him as of late he's going
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.760]  to be distracted and not be able to be in control of his administration and just
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:50.040]  kind of being led by the nose because he doesn't want to be labeled as a racist
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.320]  he doesn't want to tarnish the Trump brand you know well beyond his eight
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:59.360]  years of presidency so this is something that this is Saul Alinsky and this is
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:03.560]  what the left is using to target the president to target his supporters it
[02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:07.640]  doesn't matter how much he disavows or condemns it's never gonna be gonna stop
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.000]  it's a political tactic doesn't the left get there being manipulated that
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:17.160]  they're being controlled it's pathetic right they don't get it they don't see
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:21.680]  that they are there's agent provocateurs there's controlled opposition they don't
[02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:26.320]  see that this the person who's putting on the patriot prayer rally is a person of
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:32.520]  color on his facebook page it says no nazis no white supremacist allowed but
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.680]  they're still calling it a white supremacist rally it'll never be enough
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.720]  that's right leon macadoo on twitter leon thank you so much info wars

[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:48.800]  information that is critical this is exclusive information straight ahead
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:54.480]  we'll be back in full wars dot com what exactly is political correctness and why
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:57.600]  is it being pushed on the american public well political correctness is
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:01.320]  simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:04.680]  control public opinion by controlling your opinions the establishment gets
[02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:08.320]  you to not only agree with their agenda but to also ensure that your government
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:12.480]  created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect this is how the power
[02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:15.880]  elite and government stay in power the use psychological manipulation they
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:19.600]  turn the public into obedient sheeple and over time we lose our ability to
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:23.440]  distinguish reality from deception but how does political correctness and other
[02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:27.480]  deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment saturates mass media
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:31.160]  with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:35.360]  popular culture and is accepted as truth such as global warming for example then
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:38.560]  the establishment suppresses any counter arguments to their agenda by
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:43.120]  calling critics kooky not jobs racist or in the case of man-made climate change

[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:08.640]  aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:13.120]  nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:17.520]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so I

[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:38.160]  been witnessing the last three years plus has been CNN MSNBC the former
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:45.120]  White House run by Obama and his Justice Department openly saying police
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.560]  deserve to die because another officer another jurisdiction might have done
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:54.600]  something wrong the media would fan the flames of that in most cases to turn out
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:09:00.920]  to be a fraud and then say well cops deserve to die they're bad we're going
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:07.200]  to give you exclusive information right now from Doug Hagman who has broken big
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:13.240]  stories here like the wiener story and the texting the sexting to minors that
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.880]  was here first with Doug Hagman of the Hagman report syndicated radio
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.440]  broadcaster in his own right law enforcement trainer long-term private
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:26.360]  investigator working in New Jersey in New York I've been listening to him 15
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.960]  years interviewing him 10 years he always gives us really on spot info and
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:35.480]  I've never gotten him to send me an emergency memo like this info wars Doug
[02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:41.000]  Hagman exclusive info wars not made public until now coordinating with law
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.560]  enforcement confirming with the intel not just the public statements and CNN and
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:51.200]  MSNBC saying attack Trump supporters they're all Nazis all Trump supporters
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:56.400]  are Nazis all gun owners are Nazis telling the ACLU tweeting a photo of a
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.560]  white baby with American flag is racist ACLU apologizing saying the Eclipse is
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:06.480]  racist this is mass race war programming that Soros doubled the money after
[02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:12.480]  Trump won two black lives matter anti-fa and others and so we've got where
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.840]  they're planning the attacks what's happening they are openly saying this on
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:20.080]  the news but law enforcement is tracking a federal and state and has confirmed
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.520]  they're planning to target civilian members of the pro-trump communities
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:26.840]  that's why I was being attacked so hard in Seattle there the message is going
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.680]  out attack kill do what you can opposing groups specifically free speech groups
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.000]  ban free speech attack all protest Christian groups want to march had
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.120]  marches set up months ago say their races go out attack them I got this
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:44.800]  sounds crazy we just joined this it's mainstream news bring 10,000 dogs have
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:48.440]  mulled crap on the field where the Christians are coming no Christians no
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:53.000]  whites no conservatives no libertarians that's how it works describe it all
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.760]  opposition is all right then say it's Nazi so this is directly memos from law
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:04.240]  enforcement and there's a lot more I haven't gotten into this yet but this is
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:08.440]  very very serious all over the United States and they're preparing a violent
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.440]  revolution as they said a month ago they're getting ready the next two months
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:15.760]  overthrow Trump Soros one of the summer of raids that came out and you're gonna
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:19.320]  see CNN like it's normal like when they back the Arab Spring overthrowing our
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:22.560]  ally in Egypt saying they're blowing up churches they're burning they're killing
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:26.120]  tens of thousands this is good the Christians deserve it you'll see
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.600]  Anderson Cooper right there saying you know Ron Poles been killed Matt Dredge
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:32.520]  has been killed the president's been killed this is loving this is liberal
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:37.320]  kill kill kill that's why they've got flower shops and coffee shops in the news
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:41.840]  saying are you a racist do you pledge allegiance against Trump they're identifying
[02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:45.640]  getting their people ready as little secret agents for this so you want to
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.560]  see the globalist communist takeover they're ready they're planning it and
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:52.360]  that's why they've been trying to intimidate law enforcement to get on
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:56.520]  board so I'm gonna give the floor because he's a polite and humble guy and
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:00.000]  I'll wait for me to talk and I'll run over him Doug Hagman to go through this
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  intelligence memo a lot of which I've got from my own sources and the enemies
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.480]  out in the open this is big he's got the timetable for us thank you so much Doug
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:14.000]  Hagman Alex thanks so much for having me and I really appreciate the the war
[02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.760]  effort what you're doing and the changes that you're causing in this
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:26.800]  country you're actually doing a lot for the cost I just as of 4 10 a.m. my time
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:30.800]  this morning I heard from an investigator one of my investigators
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:36.400]  actually we've got and this is I have not really made this announcement
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.760]  official to this point but over the past several months actually since the
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:47.240]  election we have gathered I've managed to gather a handful of accredited
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:53.840]  licensed investigators all across the United States not many but enough to
[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:58.760]  make an impact the difference and to investigate and infiltrate various
[02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:03.920]  groups such as indivisible and Tifa and all of the you heard it there so you
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:10.800]  were gonna be going to project Veritas model exactly exactly now one of the
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:14.400]  things that that I heard from this morning one of the investigators I heard
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:19.880]  from this morning attended a meeting last night in San Francisco that's all
[02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:23.880]  it's all I'm prepared to say in terms of location you don't want to give up too
[02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:29.480]  much to identify him right right and this meeting I'll just summarize it by
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:34.320]  saying this the left hard left the progressive left the communist left the
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:40.680]  people that that are organizing these marches these riots more appropriately
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.960]  they are preparing for war civil war in this country their targets are
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:51.480]  civilians who openly support Donald Trump or for capitalism or free
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:57.720]  enterprise civilians who openly support free speech conservative Christians
[02:13:57.720 --> 02:14:02.920]  and conservatives and Christians separately and collectively and of course
[02:14:02.920 --> 02:14:07.360]  they have a special division or a special aspect of this where they are
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:13.400]  being taught how to confront law enforcement personnel so there's a
[02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:20.840]  three-tiered operational system taking place right now training groups right
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:25.480]  now that are in progress all across the United States that are being funded by
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:32.120]  under under the umbrella of the Obama organizing for action and the Soros the
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:38.360]  Woods fund I'm saying this now these are my words as best I can tell the
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:43.760]  nonprofits the larger NGOs that operate under the umbrella of either OFA
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:50.240]  organizing for action or the Soros group of NGOs and that they're they're
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:56.120]  funding these training sessions all across the United States offshoots of the
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:02.800]  32 or 250 satellite branches of OFA organizing for action and part and
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:09.520]  parcel to the 32,500 plus foot soldiers of organizing for action they're working
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:13.960]  in tandem with one another we have groups and we're able to verify this we
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:21.320]  have groups such as indivisible and Tifa black lives matter by any means
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:26.720]  necessary and a few new ones that have sprung up including one that just sprung
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:31.080]  up here four days ago actually the revolutionary abolitionist movement
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:38.000]  which is they just opened a Philadelphia chapter all communist fronts all that
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:46.960]  are connected to this resist narrative resist fascism narrative and this is
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.760]  all cloaked under the guys under the pretext of we're gonna fight for freedom
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:57.240]  for in this country we're gonna fight the tyranny the fascism that the
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:01.000]  Trump administration is bringing into America we're gonna bring back the
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.960]  Obama model and system of governance and we're also going to use both academia
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:12.440]  as well as and this is important Obama holdovers within our government still
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:17.280]  there including and especially within the Department of Justice that's a too
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:21.320]  pronged approach to number one be notified of any type of advanced police
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:27.040]  action and second of all to circumvent prosecution where we are to
[02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:31.200]  assistant circumventing prosecution and to stand down like in Charlottesville
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:36.600]  when they attack Christian groups or anybody else exactly so the report I
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.440]  got you this morning early this morning from my west from the investigator in
[02:16:41.440 --> 02:16:47.680]  the West Coast said this you basically won't believe the group in in San
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:52.640]  Francisco in the San Francisco area was not in San Francisco but in that area
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:59.520]  men basically that looked nothing like he had ever suspected I mean people
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.560]  dressed in nicely dressed in and dressed jeans and khakis that we're not
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:08.000]  just fighting the little dirty methods now they freaked out enough people now
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000]  and had enough public figures with authority on mainstream news and
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.520]  Congress say this that they're in a war we're gonna fight we've got Maxine
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.960]  Waters saying it's a war I'm coming for you and she's out of that area I'm
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:24.480]  coming for you Trump and you've got former CIA deputy director saying we're
[02:17:24.480 --> 02:17:27.760]  going to kill Trump soon so a lot of these are gonna end up being
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:31.600]  intelligence operatives as you just said from deep state they are preparing
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:36.240]  their move this is it ladies and gentlemen yeah and you've been ahead of
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:39.960]  the curve on this and I have to give you a lot about me my friend we now know
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:42.440]  they're they're in the news saying they're getting ready to operational so
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:47.360]  continue with your report so okay one of the things okay when my
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:53.160]  investigator went in first the thing that really surprised him first of all
[02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:58.480]  this the location of the meeting was I'm not gonna say done in code but was done
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:07.120]  very snarkly absolutely yeah there you go thank you and anyway they when he
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:10.720]  arrived at this meeting location shows they know they're getting watched
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:16.120]  absolutely and that's a good point and when he arrived at the meeting location
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:21.320]  there was an initial invitation and then went upon his arrival he was actually
[02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:25.600]  searched and they took away all electronics there was no allowance for
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:32.320]  iPads or amazing criminal intent absolutely and they actually put the
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:37.960]  phones in a separate room and made sure that they were off very interestingly and
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:44.400]  and they all but searched I mean frist like a law enforcement officer would the
[02:18:44.400 --> 02:18:49.280]  attendees to this meeting so this shows organized people are serious absolutely
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:53.600]  organized now one of the things that they're they're modeling this and it's
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:19:00.320]  this surprised me 20 or 47 years ago yesterday there was a bombing at the
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:07.080]  University of Wisconsin in Madison at 342 a.m. the target was the Army
[02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:14.120]  Mathematics Research Center and again 47 that this is April or August 24th 1970
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:22.840]  a 2000 pound ammonium nitrate fertilizer oil bomb went on and this is
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:28.440]  weatherman 2.0 it basically yeah yeah and they're they're studying the tactics
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:34.960]  and the operational methods from history from long ago from a decade
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:38.600]  stay there everything you're saying is hell I know you've got your sources of
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.400]  people infiltrating this is huge but they're out in the open saying violence
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:48.760]  is good I was wrote kill everybody and I just hope somehow we move against them

[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:51.800]  professionals it's operatives corporate governmental they've been waiting so long
[02:24:51.800 --> 02:24:55.320]  for this they're planned to launch this once Hillary got him with a race for
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.240]  they were gonna start but now we've got a beachhead to direct against them we've
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:02.800]  got him caught there in the pencil attack that's why they're so desperate
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:12.280]  and they're led at the top by a bunch of scum Harvey is slamming into Texas a
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:16.680]  hundred and ten miles an hour 35 inches of rain to 40 expected hits around seven

[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:29.800]  big storm hitting as bad as this will be for Texas and the undoubted deaths the
[02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:34.420]  35 to 40 inches of rain that are gonna hit Houston in other areas that city
[02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:39.640]  floods at three inches in one one day is that they're on the news saying we're
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:42.640]  getting ready for violence we're gonna kill Trump supporters we're gonna attack
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:46.480]  his family the lawsuits the harassment none of its work the demonization where
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:51.880]  they are on the news saying KKK a racist or everywhere horrible slander racial
[02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:56.440]  attacks on whites are exploding stabbing shootings I mean it is insane it's but
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:00.280]  most people still see through it and the Doug Hagman has worked with a bunch of
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:03.320]  law enforcement and private investigators that way you can have to go
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:06.440]  between his law enforcement can't give you info officially but the the
[02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:10.240]  investigators as the go between going to these meetings and they're planning
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:15.000]  something big something violent and targeting people so I know you get into
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.040]  what your sources are saying everybody should really start packing know what
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:22.720]  you're doing and being prepared but more importantly information warfare wise
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:26.320]  we have to get out ahead of this and because notice when they call for
[02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:31.080]  violence on their own channels that are departmentalized then we cover they go
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:34.760]  Jones is insane or Doug Hagman's insane or Matt drudge is insane or daily
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.720]  callers insane there's no plan for violence when they're all over CNN MSNBC
[02:26:38.720 --> 02:26:42.960]  so many clips every day I can even hashtag hunt Republicans people killing
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:46.960]  city council members judges Republicans being shot everywhere they're like
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.960]  nothing's happening nothing's happening while they
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:53.480]  advocate their mass they're telling us we're not attacking the Sydney war so
[02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:57.320]  classic military tactics this is a short segment long segment coming up but Doug
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:01.640]  other intel I mean this sounds like pretty serious pretty imminent and they've
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:05.400]  told us it's imminent you know they're directing from above what else politically
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:10.040]  or let's get into your report first and we'll talk about big picture well it's
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:14.560]  interesting because you've got a number of the level of coordination I suppose
[02:27:14.560 --> 02:27:20.440]  because of this limited segment the level of coordination between the foot
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:26.360]  soldiers and the people that are giving the orders is not what what anyone
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:30.880]  expected at least on on great on one to ten let's say special forces is a nine
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:34.800]  nobody gets a 10 you know your average idiot auntie father can't wipe their
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:39.080]  acid too I mean is this a seven and eight what is it maybe about a six or a
[02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:45.560]  seven frankly surprisingly efficient with respect to the communications and
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:52.120]  they're they're bringing in operational security specialists veterans anti-war
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:57.080]  people who people who served in our in Iraq and Afghanistan who are against the
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:01.600]  the war reminiscent of the anti-Vietnam era but bringing in these kind of
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:05.120]  specialists to advise them on operational security in the civil war and I'm
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:08.400]  gonna be the four we come back in a civil war I'm not I mean isn't it time if
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:11.640]  they're gonna just do whatever at certain points that there's no command
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:16.680]  control folks locally you have to deal with these people oh absolutely yeah and
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:20.880]  and I think you know what I'm saying we didn't start this but yeah we just can't
[02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:25.080]  sit here and let these people run around and kill hundreds of cops no exactly
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.080]  you're exactly right and and these people now recognize the fact that the
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:33.120]  right or the conservatives the second amendment pro-second amendment people
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:37.680]  with the concealed weapons that represent a threat to them they can't they
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.360]  can't match concealed weapon that's next in your memo there the commies are
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:47.520]  really pissed that that we laid down that emergency backup for them yes yes
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:51.920]  exactly so all of this combined and you've got this weird and then we get
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:55.680]  in this later but after the break but we get this weird amalgamation this is
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:29:01.080]  auto amalgamation of various groups that have short-term and long-term goals but
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:07.000]  everybody from the black activist groups to the to the gender identity groups
[02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:11.040]  that are combining forces see I still hear intel so good I've not said this on
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:14.360]  air because they'd attack me but I'll say it I've seen people with a bike locks
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:18.800]  the physical attacks at my own crew it's like usually trannies are attacking
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:23.400]  it's this bizarreness where it's trannies attacking yeah it's it's crazy
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.880]  it's it's beyond it's either I'm gonna shut up we know this is so riveting and

[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.360]  the briefings who they're put in place how they were already it is like night
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:42.200]  and day the bumbling politicos that Obama and George Bush put in I mean this
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:46.560]  is just night and day and so of course they're saying oh it's incompetent he
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:53.600]  doesn't care but I'm looking at this hurricane hurricane Harvey I went on
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:56.960]  air today like 11 I said reporters get down there I hope they took 37 they
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:59.920]  don't need to go to the coast but just part way down to show the evacuation the
[02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:05.680]  stores that are all cleaned out I mean it is five hours four hours from hitting
[02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:11.680]  and already it is bad this is gonna be bad bad bad I predict a hundred people
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:16.040]  are gonna die from this unfortunately this is bad Houston again three inches
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:19.560]  it's not as bad as New Orleans but it's it's basically built on a swamp I mean
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:25.360]  it's three inches it floods they're talking 35 40 inches and if that hurricane
[02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:30.760]  stalls it could be even more wow this is gonna be a disaster and so prayer for
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:35.920]  everybody obviously I've even got to get family moved out of an area where we got
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.920]  a creek because it comes up to the house and they say if something that's what
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:42.160]  ten inches it doesn't we have like 40 inches they've had hurricanes before
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:46.840]  come up park over Austin had 20 30 inches and it floods everything so this is a
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:50.800]  whopper ladies and gentlemen and we're gonna be here covering it at info wars
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:57.520]  dot com news wars dot com and we've got generator power and other systems we've
[02:34:57.520 --> 02:35:00.640]  got solar as well but not extensive so we're gonna try to the power does go up
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:05.520]  we built an industrial area so our power tends to stay on even when it goes
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:09.480]  off the rest of city because they've got some continuity government systems here
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:14.080]  in Austin so we picked an area where we're on the edge of the COG area and
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:17.520]  again that's all inside baseball it's not a secret it's just the public doesn't
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:21.440]  know how all this works so you've got former CIA directors you've got former
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:25.520]  deputy directors you got former deputy director of the FBI Phil mud all of them
[02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:30.160]  saying we're going to kill the president that's to give their own people
[02:35:30.160 --> 02:35:34.400]  encouragement to go to the meetings and to get ready and load the weapons and
[02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.800]  the explosives and I guess they think they're gonna kill police chiefs and
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:42.080]  talk show hosts and congress folks I mean they've been beta testing and think
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:47.280]  there's not gonna be struck back I don't want to kill a bunch of idiot leftist
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:52.240]  and people I but I mean I'm not gonna be the one coming after you I really feel
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:55.760]  sorry for these people though I mean I'll tell them right now the Santa Claus
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:36:00.160]  has got a list and checked it twice and the Patriots are not gonna be going
[02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:04.000]  after the stupid Annie Fah or the CIA left us that you know have been embedded
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.800]  as analysts in towns and cities for decades want to be part of a great
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:10.680]  commie commie overthrow and they're gonna lead little teams of you know folks to
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.960]  bomb stuff and dump chlorine gas down high-rise buildings air conditioning
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:20.320]  vents and stuff we know they're planning everybody involved in running this if you
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:24.640]  kicked us off you had better be on a jet out of here a lot of globalists are
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:27.960]  smart they've been getting out it's been admitted a lot of the big money is like
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:33.320]  flown off to Europe Monte Carlo the Cook Islands at least the Bahamas or
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:39.120]  Roatan or you know even little cruddy third-world areas or you've run off to
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:45.680]  Kauai Hawaii or Tasmania but all the mid-level folks that haven't the built
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:52.040]  safe houses under your mansion your name will be mud and that's not I'm not the
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:56.600]  one called for violence but you are starting a fight with the violent people
[02:36:56.600 --> 02:37:03.040]  with the people that actually know how to be violent historically so I'll take
[02:37:03.040 --> 02:37:07.720]  no pleasure in the fact that you are literally climbing into a woodshipping
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:12.560]  machine but that's what I'm telling you the Red Guards March and Oliver Austin
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:15.040]  they're all over the cut they're attacking people everywhere they are
[02:37:15.040 --> 02:37:19.600]  moving forward they're intimidated they did a beta test we kill over a hundred
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:25.400]  cops and not a lot happened that way you just think a cop here and there every
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.760]  few days getting killed and CNN going well they deserve it that was a beta test
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:34.720]  that was like a parrot test another branch for it's on it called testing the
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:38.040]  perch you got a parrot on your arm you try to put them on a branch they put
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.800]  their beak on it first now that beak is just testing to see that branches there
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:46.840]  it's a hundred times the weight when the parrot gets on they just tested the
[02:37:46.840 --> 02:37:53.520]  perch so understand that that they want the cops to get so paranoid they run
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:57.160]  into their fortresses when this kicks off so they can then demand stuff from
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:01.040]  the city council like oh take a statue down or we'll kill you prison oh 50 cops
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:04.360]  got killed will you deserve it let us take control of the department put our
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:08.000]  people in I say you're with us and we'll stop killing you okay we're made to
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:11.400]  deal with the antifa and then it's over because then they're gonna march you in
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:18.360]  against us and what has to happen has to happen so I'm just telling you you're
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:21.480]  afraid of the antifa and the communist police and I don't think you are but
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:26.440]  your bosses are compromised you better be afraid of the real civil war and I'm
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:29.760]  not here operationally planning myself even though I got that area in my brain
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:35.480]  more than most the people that do are waiting for you they are waiting and so
[02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:41.480]  you look your bosses already got out of the country so understand you pull this
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.640]  off there isn't one of you that is gonna escape judgment not one now you've got
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:51.320]  the floor my friend go over this Doug Hagman investigator police trainer great
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:54.960]  source of intel broken so many big stories here walk through at the beginning
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:59.920]  your whole memo you I'm gonna shut up you've got the floor all right well thanks
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:06.960]  Alex and just to recap you just so people know I've been I've managed it
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.320]  to organize a group of volunteer accredited licensed investigators all
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.200]  across the country just a handful to do what project Veritas has done recap that
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:21.360]  that's right to infiltrate to investigate and infiltrate various
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:26.520]  anti or these fascist groups that operate under the pretext of anti
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:33.000]  fascism groups such as but not necessarily Antifa Black Lives Matter and
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:38.560]  so on revolutionary abolitionist movement and others like that and we've
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:45.280]  found is especially last evening for I'm able to say this one of the
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.840]  investigators was able to infiltrate a meeting last night on the west coast in
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:54.240]  the San Francisco area and was just astounded by what he saw and by the way
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:01.360]  the attendance there was in the double digits low to mid double digits again
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.720]  not wanting to get too much away for our operational security reasons the age
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:11.000]  range was anywhere between in his estimation the eldest there being late
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:18.880]  60s perhaps early 70s surprisingly to as young as a late teenager and these
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:25.600]  groups or this group or they're aligning with other such fascist violent
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:32.920]  groups groups that are that comprise the resist fascism meme or narrative and
[02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:40.760]  they are now partnering with various like black activist groups is Central
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:46.080]  American Mexican other than Mexican immigration groups Muslim black and
[02:40:46.080 --> 02:40:52.080]  Arab Muslim groups in the subgroups thereof such as the propel staining and
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:59.120]  anti-Israeli groups this is not your ordinary vanilla kind of operation or
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:04.840]  just just thrown together operation this is a highly organized operation they
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:10.480]  there even the invitation for example was even done in a manner which you
[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:15.120]  would not ordinarily I mean it's not a poster on a telephone pole or a flyer
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.960]  in a windshield it was it was done via the internet through social networking
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:22.680]  and so you have to know what you're looking for to really get invited to
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:27.920]  these groups their infrastructure with their objectives I suppose they're
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:32.680]  pretty clear and they're unanimous or relatively unanimous or synonymous with
[02:41:32.680 --> 02:41:37.720]  one another building resistance inside the United States to take down Donald
[02:41:37.720 --> 02:41:41.720]  Trump the president the presidency of Donald Trump and of course ultimately
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:45.840]  our constitutional republic and take down our capital the system of
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.800]  capitalism replace it with communism that's their stated objective with
[02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:54.680]  respect to revolutionary abolitionist movement that there's now this is not
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:59.360]  necessarily where this investigator was their stated objective is to build the
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:02.760]  resistance infrastructure here in the United States they don't believe that
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:09.480]  the civil wars ever resolved and they want to or they believe it's a civil war
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:15.960]  just transferred from that war into the transition into a prison industrial
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:22.240]  complex that's what they believe the the modeling in that case they they're
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:29.240]  modeling their organization tactics and an operational motive operation along
[02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:36.280]  the resolve of revolutionary groups in Syria northern Syria their short-term
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:42.400]  objectives build the infrastructure of support to provide support to fascist
[02:42:42.400 --> 02:42:46.680]  groups like Antifa Black Lives Matter and other such groups the long-term to
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:52.160]  just to just to burn this country down replace its government and basically
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:56.080]  kill all of the people who don't agree with them we're talking about a pure
[02:42:56.080 --> 02:43:00.600]  Stalinist like purge here in the United States that's what they want to do very
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.560]  similar to the weather underground back in this and back in the 60s early 70s
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:07.880]  but here's the difference they've got total MSM behind them former CIA
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:10.840]  directors and are announcing they're getting ready to do it for confidence
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:14.800]  building and it and appear to being prepared to actually engage this so
[02:43:14.800 --> 02:43:19.560]  this is the total maximum alert you not agree with me a hundred percent agree
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:25.560]  with you and they they in fact it was stated to me during the during my
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:30.080]  briefing this morning they actually have our compiling a list when I say they
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:33.480]  I'm talking about this particular group as well as others are compiling a list
[02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:39.800]  of mayors city managers city planners city officials who are sympathetic to
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:45.000]  their causes that will work with them that can and it's it's that to that
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:51.600]  level and the next level above that academia and the mainstream media the
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:59.200]  captured corporate media working with NGOs that actually are shall we say have
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:04.280]  an allegiance to the Obama regime the Hillary Clinton the whole of the
[02:44:04.280 --> 02:44:08.560]  Hillary Clinton people but the Obama holdovers and especially those within
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:14.160]  the Department of Justice it but the bottom line here that the the targets
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:21.200]  that they're going after in in the immediate are the the civilians who
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:25.880]  are openly conservative and openly supportive of Donald Trump and the
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:30.600]  capitalistic society in which this is a main bullying operation to have the
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:34.880]  media even say this is okay when they do it it's a response to the fascism it's
[02:44:34.880 --> 02:44:37.760]  a response to the racism when the sorrows groups attacks that have
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:40.680]  overthrown other countries so we've seen the same shaking back the Arab
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:45.200]  Springs same thing in in European countries same thing in Ukraine give
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:49.280]  legitimacy to it and then hope everybody else just cowers and rolls over to
[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:56.400]  him which is not going to happen mr. mud exactly yeah it's it's it's not and I
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.080]  think that they are preparing for blowback because they're bringing in
[02:45:00.080 --> 02:45:05.520]  professionals to teach self-defense to teach gun handling gun safety good more
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:12.200]  targets yeah exactly you know the very people who say we're anti-gun are
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:15.840]  actually training and bringing in people to train them in that was the main
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.640]  tweet when the ACLU tweeted out a picture of a little white baby with
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:22.240]  an American flag saying our future's freedom they said no they showed blacks
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:25.720]  with guns basically killing white kids there was white people doing it this is
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:30.720]  total mental illness it's like a mix of fascism and communism and kkk but it's
[02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:34.120]  anti-white and it's weird white people running and I don't know what's going on
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:37.960]  this is like these people are crazy yeah what they see what happened in
[02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:43.520]  Venezuela or North Korea what is their problem well that's you know that
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.720]  cloward-piven the Venezuelan model is exactly what they're after that chaos is
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:54.440]  what they're after that they're using the Alinsky the Alinsky tactics that's
[02:45:54.440 --> 02:45:58.560]  what they want they want that exactly so what does the president do what do we
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:01.840]  do because they that they're crazy enough to telegraph a month ago that in two
[02:46:01.840 --> 02:46:05.400]  months they're gonna take the president out okay and they said back in July we're
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:08.880]  gonna have us you know violence and blame the right wing Soros admitted it so
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:13.120]  here we are they admit what they're doing obviously to telegraph confidence to
[02:46:13.120 --> 02:46:16.040]  their own people people say why would you give out operational information they
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:19.640]  have to to get people wound up to go you know dump chemicals down the high
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:22.920]  scraper and go shoot people at the school and blaming on patriots I mean
[02:46:22.920 --> 02:46:25.800]  they're gonna do false flags on us to make no mistake they're gonna run false
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:29.560]  flags and lamas have the media ready then they're gonna launch the counterop
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:32.920]  they'll launch the false flag they'll blow up the federal building they'll
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.760]  shoot up the school they'll have the Alex Jones or Trump supporters say they did
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:39.200]  it be one of their people that they got folks ready to suicide mission they
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:43.160]  caught him running the last stop that'll be phase one phase two about a weekend as
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:47.080]  you know you need to resign Trump start burning cities down and then killing
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:51.640]  cops everywhere thinking will capitulate so what do we do beforehand to stop them
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:55.680]  I think Trump has to move against a let's play a clip of Maxine Waters telling
[02:46:55.680 --> 02:47:02.320]  her constituents we're moving we're coming for you here it is here is Maxine
[02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:10.720]  Waters I don't care how big you are I don't care how high you think you are if
[02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:16.440]  you come for me I'm coming for you idiot we tried to cut taxes power people
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:23.080]  you horrible slob and so whether it's the president of the United States of
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:30.320]  America or any of his cabinet we will say to them we will resist you we will
[02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:34.040]  not I thought we were the resistance to damage this country in the way that you
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:39.240]  are doing damage it we will not allow you to take us backwards not only will we
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:49.040]  resist you we will impeach you mr. and then look at all these soft people even
[02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:52.000]  the white ladies that are in it like crank their hair into a thing like trying
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:55.680]  to like we're black it just so so sorry for black people led by people like this
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:59.640]  lady I said thank God for him for a minute and you know so many people are
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:03.600]  speaking out against this this is just madness but you know I've statistically
[02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:07.320]  been out of these events and seen it myself there's really almost no black
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:10.440]  people they don't seem to be buying into it it's almost all white people I don't
[02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:13.880]  set the virtues signal people see my live feeds in Austin my life feeds
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:20.080]  elsewhere it's 80% white so it's just crazy what do you think's really
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:27.040]  happening here well you know I think and this is just my supposition based on
[02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:31.640]  reason analysis I do believe that the shadow government of which the deep
[02:48:31.640 --> 02:48:38.400]  state is a part of a subgroup of is is in charge of all of this and if I can
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:42.960]  connect some seemingly disparate dots here I do believe that many of our
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:47.720]  congressmen and women have been compromised or being blackmailed you've
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:53.800]  got the one spy ring in Congress you've got the the server situation the email
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:49:00.280]  situation you've got this NSA this massive NSA in national law or NSA in
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:07.280]  the CIA and NRO surveillance program that has perhaps captured so much
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:11.280]  information about what they meant is used for blackmail against Patriots right
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:18.360]  exactly so so you've got compromised from within by both the I'm gonna say the
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:25.120]  Muslims Pakistani nationals in one case the the green red axis you've got a
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.240]  coalition that wants to overthrow America and fight over the spoils later
[02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  yeah exactly and they're working together right now but I'm sure at some
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:37.280]  point one is going to exert dominance over another one group over another and
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:41.800]  I think that you know of course the the red over the green will win out in this
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:45.880]  in this case but but this but this is a deep state operation at the highest
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.880]  levels I truly believe that because you don't fund something like this and you
[02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:54.240]  certainly don't organize something like this on a budget that I just see some of
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:59.120]  these cannon fodder idiots out there I agree if I gotta give it to the Democrats
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:02.800]  and the globalist they got some big wavos to pull something like this I mean
[02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:05.920]  this is basically the Democrats in deep state planning a mass cop killing
[02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:10.400]  citizen killing hardcore authoritarian coup like 1917 Russia I mean they think
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:16.000]  they're gonna execute that they have got another thing coming yeah and they want
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.600]  to implement the very thing that they say that they're against and then that
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:25.360]  that's why people get confused I think and they're using these Alinsky tactics
[02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:29.040]  little tactics and saw a linsky against us that's their motive operation let's
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:32.280]  talk about the Awan brothers and that diet but that you had many others broke
[02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:36.560]  and where all that's going to start to strike back they're trying to isolate
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:40.040]  him claiming as we can focus but we're gonna get your intel on that but man I

[02:54:15.160 --> 02:54:28.560]  I'm about to break down one of the most profound things I've ever said in 22
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:33.840]  years on here is it all clicked during the break I walked out to the crew and I
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.320]  said this is the Bolshevik Revolution 2.0 but just as the Bolshevik
[02:54:38.320 --> 02:54:42.320]  Revolution was funded by big powerful banks that wanted to sack and conquer
[02:54:42.320 --> 02:54:49.120]  Russia and replace one old system with a very anti-Christian authoritarian system
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:53.920]  just as they did it just as they modeled that attack that's their attack
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:58.440]  coming up in the next few months and Darya whose family fled communism is an
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:02.600]  army veteran and patriot she's from Russia she said Alex don't you see it's
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:08.080]  October it's 100 years since the Bolshevik takeover because I was saying
[02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:11.160]  we've got to look at the Bolshevik attack that's the same attack pattern the
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:15.840]  same big banks the same Eastern elites the same program trying it here in
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.800]  America where they get central control then order the military to order you to
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:23.880]  turn in the guns once you do that they kill the military command they knock
[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:27.360]  out the opposition parties that they've gotten it because they told the
[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:30.360]  opposition we're about to overthrow the opposition went along thinking we're
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:34.200]  getting a seat at the table they're gonna annihilate all of them then I
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:40.560]  realized it's the Trotskyites the neocons were kicked out by Stalin Trotsky
[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:43.960]  went to Mexico got killed and then his right-hand people came here and said
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.000]  we're gonna take over the Republican Party because it was the opposition to
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:52.160]  Bolshevism in America and then the very ones turn around and say the
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:56.680]  Republicans are the communists when it's flawed as they are they're the party
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:01.360]  that wasn't and see I'm cursed with history but it's hiding in plain view
[02:56:01.360 --> 02:56:06.600]  and I'm gonna host the fourth hour Roger Stone can't get a Skype up it's fine
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:09.960]  I'm gonna cause whether he'll be on the phone but wild horses couldn't drag me
[02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:12.800]  away we'll have live feeds of the hurricane all of it but there is no
[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:18.680]  doubt they're saying on CNN MSNBC we're going to overthrow the president we're
[02:56:18.680 --> 02:56:24.680]  gonna get violent we're gonna kill people antifa is good hashtag kill
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:29.240]  Republicans hunt Republicans Wolf Blitzer well the guy that killed the or shot
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:33.320]  the folks and shot Scalise he wasn't hateful he just didn't like Trump there
[02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:38.080]  they are really crazy enough to try it and I don't want to run down the poor
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:40.840]  Russians under the czars and how poor they were and that was still kind of
[02:56:40.840 --> 02:56:45.240]  futile and maybe we're maybe we're more decking it they were poor and not
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:48.360]  decking it we're just decking its loss man maybe we're maybe we will be rolled
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:51.880]  over but I don't think it's gonna go well but if they do announce
[02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:56.160]  centralization turning the guns kill Trump kill the leaders folks know just
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:59.640]  go after their leadership we're gonna beat them it's they're not gonna take the
[02:56:59.640 --> 02:57:02.920]  country if they can try to get DC to totally capitulate that other state
[02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.440]  governors they've got a COG under Trump under Obama to go in and take out state
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:11.440]  governors have special forces take over capitals special forces they don't have
[02:57:11.440 --> 02:57:15.880]  their robots and missiles in yet do not follow those orders understand we can
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:19.000]  save the Republic and I'm already putting out stuff here in case we lose
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.760]  the first round but I think we're gonna win the second round no matter I think
[02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:26.720]  we're gonna win the first but I think we got to be honest I I'm clear Doug they
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:30.440]  are beginning to launch the second most revolution in November October they
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:33.720]  think they'll be in full control of DC by October and then on the hundredth
[02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:38.320]  anniversary they intend to bring down the US oh you know what to have such a
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:43.200]  robust understanding of history I think it's so necessary now more than ever and
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:47.080]  I think that's a that's a very good analogy and a good synopsis because I
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:50.560]  think that's exactly what we're seeing and it is kind of a duck or bleed
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.560]  scenario yeah we might take a few I'm sure we will take a few but but in the
[02:57:55.560 --> 02:57:58.600]  end or in the second round I think we know we we're gonna come back and
[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:03.600]  prevail so you're absolutely correct in my view anyway on your analysis it's
[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:07.600]  some people got to get we're going to win there won't be any communication to
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:11.240]  command and control hit them don't stop you got to be ready once they start
[02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:15.120]  killing everybody you got to go you got to go you got to take it to them just go
[02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:18.440]  after the commie dirt bags and get them that's the number one thing get them and
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:21.760]  don't stop and understand you turn your guns in they're gonna string you and
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:25.680]  your wife up and rape your kids in front of you just like Lenin did all over
[02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:29.880]  Eastern Europe they want to murder and rape Christians their pedophiles we'll
[02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:33.840]  be back with fourth hour five more months Doug Ackman then Roger Stone this is
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:38.040]  real it's happening and we're here raising the alarm worldwide hold of

[02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:54.560]  problem that pretty much scares me the most I mean I try to make sure that I
[02:58:54.560 --> 02:58:59.240]  don't put tops in some food and water and beverages in my system but right now
[02:58:59.240 --> 02:59:04.160]  we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your
[02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:09.160]  body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:13.320]  disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere these are all
[02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:16.120]  parasites tell us about all the stuff I said there's so many things that are
[02:59:16.120 --> 02:59:20.080]  right you have the name in there you have the organic clove bud the organic
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:24.560]  wormwood I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:27.520]  well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today it

[02:59:43.440 --> 03:00:04.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.440 --> 03:00:16.400]  I was thinking about how big the stakes are now we always heard about a global one
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:21.000]  world government communist takeover of America now I can turn on any channel
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:26.760]  and they've got actors playing me saying I'm Alex Jones and I'm a racist or all
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:29.680]  this crazy stuff I told another channels they said we're gonna kill Trump they
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:33.840]  got former CIA directors and deputy directors saying it and then we have
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:37.080]  investigators out there like Veritas and like what the Northeast intelligence
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:40.640]  network and Hagman and Hagman are doing and they get the same intel and I see
[03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:45.200]  it on the streets people and businesses looking at me you guys making
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:49.720]  300 grand a year going we're gonna kill you and it's like they're coming of age
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:55.920]  like they're gonna get me and they but first they're gonna demonize who we are
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:00.440]  and just launching an all-out civil war and CNN when cops get killed well
[03:01:00.440 --> 03:01:04.480]  some cops are bad so cops reform yourself and you'll stop getting shot when
[03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:09.560]  you're pumping gas how the hell is some cop in Houston shot in the back of the
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:12.960]  head by his pumping gas his fault some cop might have done something wrong in
[03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:16.520]  Missouri which they didn't it's not about worshiping police but they're the
[03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:21.960]  detonator of a fake revolution there's problems in police but nothing compared
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:26.400]  to the the communists the socialists and all the rest of it and we sit here
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:30.840]  literally seeing them I'm sure of it hell they say they're getting ready to
[03:01:30.840 --> 03:01:35.000]  launch the second Bolshevik Revolution that's the primer to create the hysteria
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:38.680]  then the globalists will come in with a UN and restabilize and it won't be a
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:42.680]  pure Bolshevik system at first but they're planning this and they're
[03:01:42.680 --> 03:01:46.280]  calling Congress and everybody's saying it's about to come you need to sit out
[03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:50.840]  and we'll leave you alone that's exactly what the Bolsheviks did when they only
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:54.280]  took Moscow for like a year and they kept writing letters and sending
[03:01:54.280 --> 03:01:58.960]  emissary saying just give up to different garrisons of the military give up
[03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:04.720]  and we won't kill you and your family they give up they kill and you have to
[03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:09.520]  understand you can't give up to this that's how you lose you don't give up
[03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:13.440]  and I'll take no pleasure in a bloody war killing these people because they're
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:18.280]  animals okay I take no pleasure I want to stop this but let me tell you something
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:22.000]  we're gonna smash these people and we take America back if they if they
[03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:26.720]  watch this we're going to rat you think there was a Nazi hunt there's gonna be a
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:30.080]  hunt for globalists the world's never seen there's gonna be billion dollar
[03:02:30.080 --> 03:02:33.680]  bounties on their heads okay none of them George Soros the globalist they'll be
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:38.320]  nowhere to hide you will fail the problem is they don't mind dying they're so
[03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:42.160]  satanic they want this you understand that's what makes it so dangerous a lot
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:47.200]  of top globalists like Rockefeller presence you have died actually they
[03:02:47.200 --> 03:02:50.600]  actually like the excitement of this Doug that's why they're such a dangerous
[03:02:50.600 --> 03:02:54.560]  enemy that's why it's so sad we have to warn the military and police right now
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:56.760]  you're gonna ride shotgun once the rest of the hour of Roger Stone thanks for
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:00.760]  telling that this is a real crossroads this is for all the marbles this is it
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:09.560]  we always do it was coming it's here it's here and it's crazy I saw the
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:15.160]  comment made by Roger Stone at the I think TMZ did a quick interview or a
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:19.880]  quick question and answer and I'll tell you something they wanted Civil War go
[03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:23.240]  ahead and keep that the impeachment narrative the impeachment eject
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:29.680]  objective going at the congressional levels in it and in the media push for
[03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:35.040]  this unfitness to be president that's their narrative keep that going and
[03:03:35.040 --> 03:03:39.560]  you're gonna see the difference being of course historically between then and
[03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:44.440]  now is the fact that there will be some pushback by the conservative by the
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:49.440]  conservative right who are heavily armed or who are armed and ready to fight to
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:53.080]  protect our value system here in this country I don't think it's gonna be an
[03:03:53.080 --> 03:03:56.800]  easy and the Patriots are smart they're not gonna be like antifa hitting some
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.320]  woman they have a bike locker shooting a cop pumping gas that's right that's
[03:04:01.320 --> 03:04:05.080]  right and wouldn't you advise if a civil war kicks off the police at least need
[03:04:05.080 --> 03:04:10.160]  to get out of the way oh heck yeah yeah I mean that the police right now are
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:15.520]  essentially cannon fodder to these these idiots out there that are dressed up
[03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:19.320]  like like thugs with baseball bats with nails sticking on them for crying a
[03:04:19.320 --> 03:04:23.520]  lot so yeah I mean it's it's it's ridiculous but but but the police

[03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:05.800]  Hagman and Hagman calm syndicate a talk show host police trainer runs a big
[03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:10.200]  successful private investigator firm he followed the veritas model last year got
[03:09:10.200 --> 03:09:17.520]  his people in a lot of key positions and now his investigators liaison with
[03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:20.000]  law enforcement obviously but you're not supposed to go directly with law
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.760]  enforcement they get in trouble so they go through the former law enforcement to
[03:09:22.760 --> 03:09:25.920]  give us the intel they are in the meetings in San Francisco you name it and
[03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:30.920]  what they're saying internally mirrors people like Maxine Waters last night in
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:33.840]  the speech saying we're coming for you we're bringing you down Trump and they're
[03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:36.760]  there they're in the news saying we're gonna kill Trump supporters we're gonna
[03:09:36.760 --> 03:09:42.920]  hashtag hunt Republicans and we've got the briefing here from our sources
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:46.680]  law enforcement military and investigators now they're gonna target
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:50.880]  civilian members of the pro-trump communities for death judges lawyers
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:54.920]  members of Congress you already saw Scalise they're gonna target white
[03:09:54.920 --> 03:09:58.040]  peace officers on site they're gonna go out and just shoot as many white cops
[03:09:58.040 --> 03:10:01.600]  spot but that was only a test the hundreds of dead cops you've seen on
[03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:04.560]  last few years we're talking hundreds a day they're just gonna slaughter them in
[03:10:04.560 --> 03:10:10.680]  mass and then after all of that they're bringing in instruction on firearms
[03:10:10.680 --> 03:10:14.240]  self-defense and counter surveillance anti-police workshops self-defense
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:20.240]  workshops weapons procurement and handling no one in the in the hundreds of
[03:10:20.240 --> 03:10:23.600]  years of combined research from the people he's talked to have seen anything
[03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:28.720]  like this they say this is the weathermen 2.0 and they talk about the
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:34.200]  weathermen and those bombings of police military universities that have
[03:10:34.200 --> 03:10:37.320]  military training you name it so we're gonna ride shotgun but people just
[03:10:37.320 --> 03:10:42.280]  joined us Doug Hagman recap the magnitude I mean we've basically confirmed
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:45.640]  hell they're in the news people say why you never announced a military attack
[03:10:45.640 --> 03:10:50.440]  well yeah you do if you're trying to get your people confident to go out and dump
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:54.440]  the chlorine gas down the you know the air conditioning system of the
[03:10:54.440 --> 03:10:57.800]  high rises as we know they're training to do I mean they want mass death they
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:01.840]  want total confusion they want capitulation dead cops everywhere the
[03:11:01.840 --> 03:11:06.360]  National Guard systems hit Army Navy Marine Corps recruiting centers hit
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:10.960]  churches hit conservatives hit members of Congress hit they plan when this rushes
[03:11:10.960 --> 03:11:16.160]  for their October surprise that they're October Bolshevik 100 years later they
[03:11:16.160 --> 03:11:21.680]  plan on my my intel on killing thousands in the first few days to then have a
[03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:25.960]  shoe for peace agree to remove Trump and then when they get central control and
[03:11:25.960 --> 03:11:30.200]  quote new elections we never have new elections again COG then they start
[03:11:30.200 --> 03:11:33.440]  killing everybody all the leadership will start getting arrested getting killed
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:37.160]  now I because they admitted this in Atlantic Monthly this is their COG plan
[03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:42.120]  I've been briefed by folks that have seen classified versions of Valkyrie from
[03:11:42.120 --> 03:11:46.080]  Germany but also systems here that were floated in the 80s the congressional
[03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:50.320]  hearings on they're planning to use Nuremberg study of that plan but actually
[03:11:50.320 --> 03:11:55.280]  against us so a Bolshevik revolution meets Operation Valkyrie against the
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:11:59.920]  American people Doug Hagman recap them are going to Roger Stone yeah just
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:04.840]  briefly for those just joining him essentially we have a handful of
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:09.160]  investigators across the country specific cities infiltrating investigating
[03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:14.120]  infiltrating these of fascist groups they've successfully done so in many
[03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:18.640]  cases the latest report early this morning 410 Eastern time this morning
[03:12:18.640 --> 03:12:25.160]  saying look this one particular meeting in San Francisco so well organized the
[03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:31.480]  tactics the training the training being very professional the age of people
[03:12:31.480 --> 03:12:37.400]  there range from late 60s perhaps early 70s all the way down to late teens this
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:42.240]  is the resist fascism movement that's what they're calling themselves but it's
[03:12:42.240 --> 03:12:47.240]  actually a lot of professionals these aren't just the average method yeah
[03:12:47.240 --> 03:12:52.760]  exactly these are above the these are the people who are sending out the
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:12:57.480]  cannon fodder this the idiots you see in the street with the baseball or the
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:02.400]  bicycle helmets on and the baseball bats I mean those people are the useful
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:06.720]  idiots the you know hire a stooge for a day or two and go out there and take a
[03:13:06.720 --> 03:13:11.080]  few wax okay that's who those people are these people are the planners these
[03:13:11.080 --> 03:13:14.640]  people are the architects of the chaos that we're seeing the brain and yeah
[03:13:14.640 --> 03:13:19.720]  exactly however they're bringing in these these professionals to teach as you
[03:13:19.720 --> 03:13:24.680]  said the weapons self-defense their force multiplying a revolutionary group
[03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:29.320]  yep yeah yeah and to go against law enforcement as well and so the bottom
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:32.480]  line here is they want to burn everything down baby if they can't have it
[03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:37.080]  which they can't they didn't trump one they're on over it so burn it all down
[03:13:37.080 --> 03:13:42.320]  baby but burn it down to the ground and by any means necessary to instance to
[03:13:42.320 --> 03:13:48.600]  install a communist type government and but but cloak it in this anti-fascism
[03:13:48.600 --> 03:13:52.240]  movement which is by the way I'm not an authoritarian I'm anti-police state
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:55.520]  non-anti-police but I know that it's here to come in a uniform if they're
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:13:59.360]  planning the overthrow admitting it having former CIA deputy director saying
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:03.480]  we're gonna kill Trump soon it's not authoritarian to move against them
[03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:07.280]  paramilitarily and and they don't even make it to the police station because
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:09.920]  you don't even need a judge or jury when you're trying to overthrow the whole
[03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:13.240]  country and saying kill the president they just they're never seen again I
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:16.360]  mean if they really want this war and they want to kill hundreds of millions
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:19.400]  of people potentially I mean a nuclear war could start over this we have I
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:22.520]  mean I don't want to sound tough I never talked about this in 20 years they're
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:25.600]  the ones wanting to push this I mean there's no half measures we need to
[03:14:25.600 --> 03:14:29.680]  identify not ourselves individually but through Trump through the patriots
[03:14:29.680 --> 03:14:33.120]  they're in the government identify do we wait till they make their next big
[03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:36.760]  strike or we move now because every minute we sit here and don't tell
[03:14:36.760 --> 03:14:41.040]  ourselves the truth we are in deep trouble only maximum commitments gonna
[03:14:41.040 --> 03:14:46.960]  defeat these people yeah it's either duck bleed or fight back and I think what
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:52.160]  we're doing by exposing and working with law enforcement I think I think this is
[03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:56.680]  working out well but there will come a point in time when we have to dig in and
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:00.120]  say okay you know what we're not gonna take casualties we're not gonna do this
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:03.320]  and we were gonna have to fight back exactly we already seen over a hundred
[03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:06.760]  cops executed the media celebrating it's not just about worshiping cops but if
[03:15:06.760 --> 03:15:11.600]  they can kill innocent cops they can kill anybody absolutely oh yeah yeah I mean
[03:15:11.600 --> 03:15:17.080]  for crying out loud you you kill a police officer you're gonna kill anyone and
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:24.400]  we have to get away with that they've set this yeah it's ridiculous this is
[03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:29.320]  this is so well organized and I think the last thing I really wanted to
[03:15:29.320 --> 03:15:35.320]  mention is I think we cannot understate the what we're seeing here but we and
[03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:39.560]  we also have to really place responsibility where it belongs and that
[03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:45.000]  is this shadow government that's operational by Obama by the Obama hold
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:49.680]  which he admittedly dug in he admittedly called it a shadow government yeah
[03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:54.480]  exactly and and he goes back decades but but really under the Obama
[03:15:54.480 --> 03:15:57.960]  organizing for action which is the fourth iteration of the plans or their
[03:15:57.960 --> 03:16:01.280]  various groups but but these are the foot soldiers that we're seeing now we're
[03:16:01.280 --> 03:16:05.120]  seeing everything come to come to fruition that's been planned let's be
[03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:09.560]  clear this is not a drill they admit themselves they intend to try it which is
[03:16:09.560 --> 03:16:13.920]  crazy historically I must say this sound positive they have a 10% chance of
[03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:21.680]  succeeding done it's yeah I'd put our I'd put the patriots against these these
[03:16:21.680 --> 03:16:26.160]  this cannon fodder any day of the week the problem is what are our enemies like
[03:16:26.160 --> 03:16:34.120]  China and North Korea going to do when we are tied down in this that's a great
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:38.040]  question you know I'm not I'm no expert in that in that department I don't know
[03:16:38.040 --> 03:16:40.960]  but I'll tell you something we certainly don't need that division that
[03:16:40.960 --> 03:16:46.560]  they're causing you talk about some potential for you know takeover and make
[03:16:46.560 --> 03:16:51.240]  no mistake who's directing the Democrats more Morris to red China that's yeah
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:56.000]  very very much so when you see the Clinton relationship with the foreign
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:00.840]  entities yeah I can't believe we put up with this long I mean all these people
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:05.640]  should be nice to be facing grand jury I'll leave it at that I mean this is so
[03:17:05.640 --> 03:17:10.280]  ridiculous yeah we're all in the line here folks this is real you they got 10
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:14.640]  TV shows attacking me right now made for TV movies they're all coming after us
[03:17:14.640 --> 03:17:19.040]  this is real and you know what it's okay we're in this this is life what's gonna
[03:17:19.040 --> 03:17:23.360]  be gravy training shopping malls and movies and ballgames forever okay this
[03:17:23.360 --> 03:17:27.560]  is the big push this is the big attack we beat this we got 50 years of
[03:17:27.560 --> 03:17:31.520]  prosperity after this and the new American Century but we get defeated in
[03:17:31.520 --> 03:17:36.880]  this it is hell on earth and I'm not worried about myself I'm a man I can take
[03:17:36.880 --> 03:17:40.540]  let me tell you something I don't mind it I don't mind the pain to quote Glenn
[03:17:40.540 --> 03:17:45.280]  Danzig I really don't but I really feel sorry for the kids and everybody else so
[03:17:45.280 --> 03:17:48.640]  I was telling you if we got to do this right now I'm not afraid of these people
[03:17:48.640 --> 03:17:51.400]  I'm afraid I'm not gonna do a good enough job now I'm gonna skip this breaks we
[03:17:51.400 --> 03:17:53.920]  have more time go to Roger Stone here he is getting off a plane a few days ago
[03:17:53.920 --> 03:17:58.320]  and TMZ yelling at him saying oh you know you're planning violence or whatever
[03:17:58.320 --> 03:18:02.280]  and here he is you're saying look what do you think's gonna happen when you start
[03:18:02.280 --> 03:18:06.120]  a war and keep attacking us this is what's gonna happen they want a civil war
[03:18:06.120 --> 03:18:09.880]  is Roger Stone people are even calling for like impeachment already and that
[03:18:09.880 --> 03:18:12.760]  sort of stuff do you think there's any any chance that he might be impeached the
[03:18:12.760 --> 03:18:16.080]  people who are calling for impeachment are the people who didn't vote for him
[03:18:16.080 --> 03:18:20.800]  they need to get over it they lost the candidate had every advantage she spent
[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:26.920]  two billion dollars he spent 275 billion sorry he whipped her ass it's over you
[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:32.120]  lost try to impeach him just try it you will have a spasm of violence in this
[03:18:32.120 --> 03:18:36.200]  country an insurrection like you've never seen you think no question you think
[03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:40.280]  if you got impeached like the country sides are heavily armed my friend yes
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:46.720]  absolutely this is not 1974 they the people will not stand for impeachment
[03:18:46.720 --> 03:18:51.480]  a politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life there will
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:56.440]  be violence on both sides I'll make this clear I'm not advocating violence but
[03:18:56.440 --> 03:18:59.640]  I'm predicting you're predicting that if he got impeached there'd be some sort of
[03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:04.520]  civil war type yes that's what I think will happen hell that's what they've
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:08.120]  been pushing and here's the thing they want to train us march out to face a
[03:19:08.120 --> 03:19:14.280]  bunch of toilet paper antifa if they're not killing people they go kill cops they
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:18.920]  go send folks to shoot members of Congress they're killing cops and
[03:19:18.920 --> 03:19:23.640]  Congress people what I'm telling you you don't go out and fight dirty methods
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:28.640]  who aren't even worth killing you let the leadership of the coup know that's on
[03:19:28.640 --> 03:19:31.880]  TV saying they're gonna kill the president that you know what this is a
[03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:37.920]  two-way street brother and let let them feel physics let them feel let them feel
[03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:44.560]  it let them know because once you let the dogs of war off the chain they're
[03:19:44.560 --> 03:19:48.360]  gonna find America's restraint hadn't been weakness hadn't been cowardice it's
[03:19:48.360 --> 03:19:54.800]  been guilt at what incredible killers we are how easy it is how good we are at
[03:19:54.800 --> 03:20:01.080]  it your constituents can hardly walk you have no idea I'm not trying to
[03:20:01.080 --> 03:20:03.880]  intimidate the enemy because they're totally turned over to evil they're not
[03:20:03.880 --> 03:20:07.880]  gonna listen I just want the listeners to know if we go where they want to take
[03:20:07.880 --> 03:20:18.280]  us let's give them what they came for in spades in royal flush Roger Stone we
[03:20:18.280 --> 03:20:21.560]  stand at the precipice the second Bolshevik Revolution is upon us in
[03:20:21.560 --> 03:20:25.200]  October there's no doubt they're launching operations does the president
[03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:33.200]  know what can we do Roger Stone I must tell you I got jostled on the street
[03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:37.800]  here in West Hollywood this morning I guess this has become the way of the
[03:20:37.800 --> 03:20:42.560]  world the citizen cannot even walk on the streets without being assaulted by
[03:20:42.560 --> 03:20:47.480]  hysterical leftists it reflects everything that you have not only said
[03:20:47.480 --> 03:20:53.320]  but what you have predicted now for months that this that this conflagration
[03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:57.320]  was coming you remember election nine I'm not bragging what did I tell you no
[03:20:57.320 --> 03:21:02.360]  you said that you were a little downcast not because we won but because you
[03:21:02.360 --> 03:21:07.320]  foresaw the fact that the left would never accept the Democratic election would
[03:21:07.320 --> 03:21:12.040]  never accept the results I was preparing to die Roger I'm not gonna see
[03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:15.200]  you know I could see where we're going but we're gonna win in the end but no I
[03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:19.880]  was preparing to die that night you understand now yes indeed I now see
[03:21:19.880 --> 03:21:26.320]  the big picture I've never seen this kind of hysteria ever before on the
[03:21:26.320 --> 03:21:31.760]  political front and they just keep ratcheting up their entire Russian gambit
[03:21:31.760 --> 03:21:37.040]  which was designed to remove Trump has failed has fallen flat even this new
[03:21:37.040 --> 03:21:44.520]  email that was discovered in the email of Rick Dearborn oh my god somebody in
[03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:47.840]  the transition team said sometime we're gonna talk to Putin like you're gonna
[03:21:47.840 --> 03:21:54.080]  talk to everybody we caught him talking to the Japanese Prime Minister yeah it's
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:21:58.040]  not even that serious when you run the presidential campaign you get thousands
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:04.320]  and thousands of incoming messages from well-meaning people who have no
[03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:09.240]  judgment whoever the person in West Virginia was who said oh the campaign
[03:22:09.240 --> 03:22:14.920]  staff should meet with Vladimir Putin I mean that's not only improbable
[03:22:14.920 --> 03:22:21.040]  impossible and highly unlikely it's absurd and by the way there's no evidence
[03:22:21.040 --> 03:22:24.760]  that any such meeting ever happened and how do we know the Democrats didn't send
[03:22:24.760 --> 03:22:28.800]  the email it's not even a response it's an email they can send me an email saying
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:34.160]  I'm Captain Kangaroo and say oh look Alex is talking to Captain Kangaroo yeah
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:39.120]  but you see again the media is all over it today the way they were over the
[03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:44.480]  Donald Trump Jr. meeting as if it was something they're running out of
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:51.160]  straws they switched therefore from Russia because that failed to race race the
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:57.920]  race card and race baiting is a kind of a surefire issue for the left going so
[03:22:57.920 --> 03:23:02.440]  far as to say anybody who voted for Donald Trump is a white supremacist that's
[03:23:02.440 --> 03:23:07.520]  the most ridiculous thing I literally have ever heard absurd absolutely absurd
[03:23:07.520 --> 03:23:10.960]  but clearly I think Russia and all of it is a smoke screen for race war they're
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:14.760]  going with this narrative they're activating their cells it's confirmed
[03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:20.920]  where do you think this is going well when you have CNN and other news
[03:23:20.920 --> 03:23:26.200]  outlets excusing the violence of the left saying because of the oppressive
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:31.520]  history of slavery that it's perfectly all right because some cops were bad all
[03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:35.440]  cops deserve to be killed exactly they're now calling for violence on CNN
[03:23:35.440 --> 03:23:40.800]  Roger it's extraordinary then the other thing I find interesting is that CNN
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:47.440]  actually has a promo to keep playing that says as the Trump presidency implodes
[03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:53.440]  who said it's imploding he's not going anywhere other than continuing to do the
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:59.840]  job the CNN not know that their bosses are trying to entice loose cannon people
[03:23:59.840 --> 03:24:03.760]  to attack them don't attack folks let them move let them attack us first let
[03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:06.440]  them do I mean we were winning intellectually but they're the ones
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:10.200]  getting there for violence doesn't the CNN employees realize they're being
[03:24:10.200 --> 03:24:14.920]  sucked into a civil war well I think that they have sped up their timetable
[03:24:14.920 --> 03:24:19.560]  at CNN to call for anarchy because the handwriting is on the wall and they
[03:24:19.560 --> 03:24:24.360]  know that Jeff Zucker will shoot shortly be out and that they will have new
[03:24:24.360 --> 03:24:30.880]  management that may not look as favorably on their revolutionary credo as the
[03:24:30.880 --> 03:24:35.880]  current management at CNN that's why I think they have gone you know zero to
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:40.720]  sixty overnight yeah they're trying to fit like cockroaches when you poison them
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:44.120]  they all start having sex I always heard this and one time I sprayed a bunch of
[03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:46.960]  roaches I found behind the refrigerator and they all started having sex
[03:24:46.960 --> 03:24:50.000]  immediately when I sprayed them it's like they know they're all done for
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:54.360]  they're losing so now they're trying to move the revolution forward that makes
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:25:01.200]  perfect sense to me I mean the tone and the hysteria at CNN has now reached
[03:25:01.200 --> 03:25:06.840]  epic proportions watching Anderson Cooper show the other night with Ed
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:12.760]  Martin oh it's just unreal it's total five on one I've never seen anything like it
[03:25:12.760 --> 03:25:15.240]  by the way I thought Martin handled himself pretty well under those
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:19.200]  circumstances and I've seen him here on info wars many times he's a solid
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:25.800]  patriotic fellow take a lot of guts to go on five on one yeah the guys wanted me
[03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:29.240]  to play that clip yesterday it's very very powerful they all gang on their all
[03:25:29.240 --> 03:25:33.800]  and CNN says quote all Trump supporters are white supremacists that is so
[03:25:33.800 --> 03:25:38.080]  dangerous that is so wild there's nowhere for them to go next when they've
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:42.000]  already had Phil Mudd saying kill the president we're gonna kill him he's a
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:47.320]  former deputy director of the CIA and FBI I mean why SWAT teams didn't take him
[03:25:47.320 --> 03:25:52.240]  for a kayaking trip the next morning I mean this is insane yeah well again
[03:25:52.240 --> 03:25:58.360]  Jeff Sessions has the power to move against the Obama NSA clique those are
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:04.560]  the people orchestrating this revolution this insurgency specifically John
[03:26:04.560 --> 03:26:09.400]  Brennan Admiral Rogers James Clapper yeah I don't like this this fellow
[03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:13.960]  clapper who got caught lying twice in front of the Congress about the
[03:26:13.960 --> 03:26:19.880]  government's metadata program only to be proven to be a liar by Edward Snowden
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:25.440]  he's now running around saying I don't focus on fit no dude you're the one who's
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:29.680]  unfit you're the one who belongs in a federal penitentiary what are you
[03:26:29.680 --> 03:26:34.480]  talking about and mr. Clapper what's with the shaved heads thing why are you
[03:26:34.480 --> 03:26:39.160]  guys all have shaved heads it's coming some kind of secret club or what well
[03:26:39.160 --> 03:26:45.640]  let's expand on this they're desperate they're pathetic but they're
[03:26:45.640 --> 03:26:50.560]  constituents everybody I know on their uber bills on power bills on bank
[03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:55.160]  statements there's like there's KKK everywhere report Nazis attack them if
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:27:00.080]  you see them the corporations are like all this is the revolution all I'm
[03:27:00.080 --> 03:27:04.440]  telling you is they are now firing on all fronts but it may just be a giant
[03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:08.200]  toddler event because none of them are willing to pull triggers like the Bolshevik
[03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:11.880]  Revolution I mean does this thing just fizzle or a few poor cops get shot in the
[03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:15.320]  back of the head or what happens well I think we shall see their problem of
[03:27:15.320 --> 03:27:20.440]  course is that they are seeing guts and ghosts to where none exist I've been
[03:27:20.440 --> 03:27:26.040]  active on the American right for 40 years I've never met any Klansman I've
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:30.720]  never actually seen any white supremacists I don't know any neo-nazis I
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:35.200]  think this is a handful of nuts a handful of cooks the idea that they're
[03:27:35.200 --> 03:27:39.760]  everywhere no they're nowhere now what there are however is crazy left-wing
[03:27:39.760 --> 03:27:44.520]  radicals from in teapot and black lives matter there are plenty of them they're
[03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:49.240]  so gutless they have to wear masks they won't even show their faces what they
[03:27:49.240 --> 03:27:53.680]  don't most other we've learned their group got leaked they're almost all
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:58.840]  school teachers well what I find interesting is the fact that they don't
[03:27:58.840 --> 03:28:03.840]  recognize the American rights along adherence to the Second Amendment and
[03:28:03.840 --> 03:28:08.360]  the vast number of patriots who own firearms and how to use them this is
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:13.680]  why they've been trying to get the guns away from Patriots for so long again I
[03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:19.280]  don't advocate violence I renounce violence I'm not condoning violence I'm
[03:28:19.280 --> 03:28:24.400]  against violence they like to twist your words when you foresee what's
[03:28:24.400 --> 03:28:30.160]  happening or what will happen as I did on TMZ well then it was stone calls for
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:34.400]  civil war no I call for nothing of the kind stone calls for violence no I never
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:39.920]  said that at all go listen to the whole interview but they twist your words and
[03:28:39.920 --> 03:28:44.400]  attempt all I'm doing is warning these people you want to come kill me and kill
[03:28:44.400 --> 03:28:48.120]  the president and piss all over George Washington you're going to get a fight
[03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:54.320]  dumbass George Washington freed his slaves and he also made financial
[03:28:54.320 --> 03:29:00.800]  arrangements so they would all have an opportunity he he was a great man father
[03:29:00.800 --> 03:29:04.640]  of our country now they want to tear down his portrait tear down his statues
[03:29:04.640 --> 03:29:09.480]  ridiculous I like he was born into all that and then reportedly most his wealth
[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:13.840]  went to putting this people into education and giving them money when he
[03:29:13.840 --> 03:29:17.480]  ended it but it doesn't matter that the West ended slavery they project the
[03:29:17.480 --> 03:29:20.280]  lion to come back to Doug Hagman get his take on this credible breakdown of
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.440]  Roger Stone also look at other attacks it was Roger Stone predicted the whole

[03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:09.120]  cases had much better nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought
[03:32:09.120 --> 03:32:13.760]  out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing
[03:32:13.760 --> 03:32:18.800]  and so I set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated bone

[03:33:57.440 --> 03:34:02.680]  and just overall how people are responding so I want to call Owen or
[03:34:02.680 --> 03:34:06.960]  I'll do it I guess well the guests are talking and line up some of that
[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:12.960]  information just briefly poor Gwyneth Paltrow I saw months ago when they put
[03:34:12.960 --> 03:34:16.920]  her on all the big comedy shows TV shows saying look the left-wing has their
[03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:20.560]  cooks that sell supplements and so does Alex Jones they didn't say Jeff Bezos
[03:34:20.560 --> 03:34:24.920]  does and he owns Amazon he owns Whole Foods and Alex private labels a lot of
[03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:28.440]  the stuff that's sold at Whole Foods no it was like Alex Jones is evil selling
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:32.720]  melatonin for sleep and vitamin C for health and Alex Jones is evil and says
[03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:36.480]  vitamin B12 good for he's a complete lying scumbag racist KKK member and
[03:34:36.480 --> 03:34:40.400]  literally that's what they said and I said look they're gonna have some
[03:34:40.400 --> 03:34:45.160]  watchdog group file complaints and ask district attorneys or others or state
[03:34:45.160 --> 03:34:48.600]  attorney generals to indict with Paltrow and I and I said this month ago I
[03:34:48.600 --> 03:34:53.680]  said they're gonna indict her first and go see we weren't picking on right
[03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:58.800]  wingers we indicted with Paltrow now I didn't just know about this before they
[03:34:58.800 --> 03:35:03.480]  picked Paltrow people were at meetings in DC New York and other areas with the
[03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:07.080]  lawyers where they had this whole strategy and they said well they're
[03:35:07.080 --> 03:35:10.040]  gonna burn some leftist for the supplements and then Alex Jones so I
[03:35:10.040 --> 03:35:17.640]  knew when I saw it so do it it will blow up in your face bigger than Dallas and
[03:35:17.640 --> 03:35:22.240]  that is some confidence game here I mean your death threats what you've done to

[03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:48.320]  fight but going back to Doug Hagman about other points on this front and
[03:37:48.320 --> 03:37:53.680]  then to Roger Stone Doug Hagman Alex thanks and you know I was enjoying the
[03:37:53.680 --> 03:37:58.040]  conversation between you and Mr. Stone and I thought as I was listening to
[03:37:58.040 --> 03:38:03.760]  that I recalled Mr. Stone talking about Donald Trump's execution by Robert
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:08.080]  Bueller and of course how he Donald Trump is being isolated and I think
[03:38:08.080 --> 03:38:13.120]  everything that I spoke about with respect to the various fascist groups
[03:38:13.120 --> 03:38:19.000]  that are at the street level and above kind of remember what Van Jones said
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:24.280]  said top down bottom up bottom up top down whatever and I think that's what
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:27.960]  we're seeing take place right now so this Spencer movement as you refer to it
[03:38:27.960 --> 03:38:33.240]  but with respect to the top down which Mr. Stone as had mentioned about the
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:36.360]  execution by Mueller I think that the I think that it's important for people to
[03:38:36.360 --> 03:38:42.280]  realize that Mueller number one is not qualified of course to be in that
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:47.800]  independent council position based on I think it's a 18 CFR 45.2 or one of
[03:38:47.800 --> 03:38:54.480]  those one of those the fact that he's got political and personal relationships
[03:38:54.480 --> 03:38:57.440]  with the principal so he can't be a prosecutor and a witness at the same
[03:38:57.440 --> 03:39:03.240]  time but of course exceptions are made in the grand jury with respect to this
[03:39:03.240 --> 03:39:09.280]  it's a swamp grand jury that has no credibility you've got 99.8% of the
[03:39:09.280 --> 03:39:12.520]  donations on Democrats you've got them ignoring all the stuff the Democrats
[03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:16.800]  said you've got almost all their people being Democrats you've got tell me caught
[03:39:16.800 --> 03:39:20.200]  lying to Congress yeah notice they're kind of backing off the Russian
[03:39:20.200 --> 03:39:23.000]  narrative what's your intel on that right now because now they've gone on the
[03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:26.600]  right I mean it seems like they're kind of realizing even their fraud claims
[03:39:26.600 --> 03:39:30.480]  Trump uses outside accounting firms and it's super clean it seems like that's
[03:39:30.480 --> 03:39:34.960]  hitting a dead end well and that's interesting how that Russian narrative
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:39.240]  is seemingly dissolving and I think what they're trying to do is breathe new
[03:39:39.240 --> 03:39:44.280]  life into that Russian narrative by attempting to flip Paul Manafort look I
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:50.400]  don't I don't have a good sense on that however I don't believe that's gonna
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:39:55.240]  happen I think that I think that perhaps new life will be breathed into the
[03:39:55.240 --> 03:39:59.520]  Russian narrative or at least that's what they want to have happened so let me
[03:39:59.520 --> 03:40:02.840]  bring him up and jump in any time Roger used to be business partners with Paul
[03:40:02.840 --> 03:40:07.080]  Manafort great Patriot worked with groups against Russia you know all these
[03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:11.560]  claims are asinine but they are trying to flip Manafort on SWAT team raids on
[03:40:11.560 --> 03:40:16.000]  stuff you already gave him where is that going I think it's going precisely
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:21.960]  nowhere I spoke to Paul roughly a week ago he's very angry and continues to be
[03:40:21.960 --> 03:40:27.000]  defiant the truth of it is they want him to bear false witness against the
[03:40:27.000 --> 03:40:32.440]  president they want him to say yes I was colluding with the Russians and yes
[03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:37.240]  down from do everything so they want him to become Judas Iscariot they want him
[03:40:37.240 --> 03:40:42.760]  to become John Dean and he's not going to do it he's not going to lie therefore
[03:40:42.760 --> 03:40:46.760]  they're trying to dredge up any pressure point on him they can find the
[03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:52.240]  irony of this Nazi like Gestapo raid on his home where they kick in the door
[03:40:52.240 --> 03:40:57.040]  then they kick in the door to the bedroom where he's sleeping with his wife to
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:00.720]  get documents that they had never requested formally and could have had
[03:41:00.720 --> 03:41:07.080]  easily it's a charade but Manafort is holding strong despite the extraordinary
[03:41:07.080 --> 03:41:13.760]  assault on his character on his business on his family he remains a hundred
[03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:20.040]  percent loyal to the president and to the administration and we're all the same
[03:41:20.040 --> 03:41:23.800]  shooting range here it's just like because we're not just loyal to Trump
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:27.560]  we're loyal to America and we don't stand with the pedophile armies of Hillary
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:32.440]  Clinton well not only that but Alex I saw something extraordinary today I just
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:38.000]  hung up with a political reporter Gary Cohn the president's chief economic
[03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:46.120]  advisor a former alum of Goldman Sachs liberal Democrat recommended for his
[03:41:46.120 --> 03:41:51.760]  job by Jared Kushner the president's son-in-law is out publicly attacking the
[03:41:51.760 --> 03:41:57.360]  administration now I saw that what the Reagan White House
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:02.960]  I work with the Bush White House I've never seen anything like this in the
[03:42:02.960 --> 03:42:08.000]  40 years I've been in American politics if you work in the White House you serve
[03:42:08.000 --> 03:42:13.320]  at the pleasure of the president if I hear one of my employees all on Roger
[03:42:13.320 --> 03:42:17.520]  if I hear one of my employees on talking trash they're fired that's what you
[03:42:17.520 --> 03:42:22.240]  don't do that well it's unprofessional as well as disloyal if you've got a
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:27.480]  problem then you come internally plus that's like a leak that's a form of a
[03:42:27.480 --> 03:42:32.160]  leak laundry like this that's the form of a leak though they want to shut the
[03:42:32.160 --> 03:42:35.680]  patriots off to Trump and supporting so they can run around he doesn't know
[03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:39.760]  they're they're undermining him what a little piece of crap what do we do this
[03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:44.160]  guy should be fired so fast his head would spin I mean it's extraordinary to
[03:42:44.160 --> 03:42:50.720]  me that that he's trying to feather his own nest here he's joined the chorus of
[03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:55.080]  anti-Trump rhetoric when he's a White House insider but he's been bestowed
[03:42:55.080 --> 03:42:59.600]  one of the greatest honor you could have in public services to serve on the
[03:42:59.600 --> 03:43:04.840]  White House staff but the I guess the lesson the story is when you go to bed
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:10.160]  with dogs you wake up with please why would anybody in the Trump White House
[03:43:10.160 --> 03:43:17.600]  want to employ a liberal Democrat they call him carbon tax Gary because that's
[03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:22.480]  what he did at Goldman why would you ever bring him in to the White House to
[03:43:22.480 --> 03:43:26.800]  begin obviously against Trump Trump killed that multi hundred trillion dollar
[03:43:26.800 --> 03:43:30.120]  deal they planned over the next few decades Gary Cohn Trump's advisors said
[03:43:30.120 --> 03:43:33.800]  to have drafted a resignation letter after Charlottesville well then let them
[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:38.680]  leave good God Trump's not a racist I mean just let this little leftist turd
[03:43:38.680 --> 03:43:43.080]  bag leave God we're sick of these parasites stay there Roger Stone stay
[03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:49.080]  there obviously mr. Doug Hagman let's go now via Skype driving down the halfway
[03:43:49.080 --> 03:43:53.880]  to the Texas coast Owen shroyer to cover the big lines of cars is what I want
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:57.480]  the evacuation zone once you get there I want to get the stores that are all
[03:43:57.480 --> 03:44:01.160]  empty obviously when you get the storm surge but it's about civilization on the
[03:44:01.160 --> 03:44:05.840]  edge and how even a storm like this puts us into crisis and how they're gonna
[03:44:05.840 --> 03:44:09.000]  try to demonize the president for his response that's already been very rare
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:14.960]  well-planned focused and robust Owen shroyer well we're almost a stand-in
[03:44:14.960 --> 03:44:19.240]  tornado right now then we're gonna hop on the 37 which is apparently where a
[03:44:19.240 --> 03:44:27.640]  lot of traffic is the main evacuation zone 37 is the main evacuation zone yeah
[03:44:27.640 --> 03:44:31.760]  so they're heading towards 37 right now and then we're gonna head into the
[03:44:31.760 --> 03:44:37.080]  belly of hurricane Harvey and we're gonna see what people are doing if
[03:44:37.080 --> 03:44:40.480]  people are really evacuating like they've been told that people are
[03:44:40.480 --> 03:44:44.360]  hunkering down people we already know are raiding the spurs so we're gonna see
[03:44:44.360 --> 03:44:47.880]  all that we'll see if we can see the female response whether it be good or
[03:44:47.880 --> 03:44:51.200]  bad I know the president Trump has been really preparing for this I can't
[03:44:51.200 --> 03:44:56.960]  remember during Hurricane Sandy or Hurricane Katrina maybe you can remember
[03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:01.080]  this but I don't remember any of the president doing as much action prior to
[03:45:01.080 --> 03:45:04.840]  the actual hurricane prior to the devastation that the weather is gonna
[03:45:04.840 --> 03:45:09.200]  bring the president Trump has been drawing attention to I've never seen
[03:45:09.200 --> 03:45:12.040]  that before in the past Obama didn't really do it I don't think Bush did it
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:16.400]  you can see what happened if Sandy and Katrina just for proof of that so we're
[03:45:16.400 --> 03:45:21.080]  gonna by the way Obama did nothing for Hurricane Sandy but that was okay but
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:24.160]  Trump hasn't done enough even though it hasn't hit yet that's the new talking
[03:45:24.160 --> 03:45:30.880]  point yes so we'll see what the responses like from FEMA they really need to get
[03:45:30.880 --> 03:45:35.280]  involved if it's that devastating oh they're gonna need to get involved that
[03:45:35.280 --> 03:45:39.840]  is a fast-moving big hurricane it is three inches puts you some water we're
[03:45:39.840 --> 03:45:45.880]  talking 35 40 inches this is gonna be a disaster you know and to the point that
[03:45:45.880 --> 03:45:50.240]  you were saying earlier if you live in downtown Austin and there was some sort
[03:45:50.240 --> 03:45:54.680]  of a big event and you had to get out of the city good luck you're not going
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:45:58.640]  anywhere because they have you bottlenecked onto three bridges there's
[03:45:58.640 --> 03:46:02.440]  only three bridges you can get over the water with so you know this is the type
[03:46:02.440 --> 03:46:06.800]  of thing that makes people realize how fragile society really can be in the
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:10.400]  midst of a big event especially when you're in a big city like Austin if
[03:46:10.400 --> 03:46:13.360]  people try to get out you're not going anywhere buddy you're stuck you better
[03:46:13.360 --> 03:46:18.360]  be prepared and you know I said this the other day Alex and this is sad but I
[03:46:18.360 --> 03:46:22.800]  think it's true I think that we are gonna see some serious devastation from the
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:26.240]  hurricane I think it's gonna hit Corpus Christi hard tonight I think it's gonna
[03:46:26.240 --> 03:46:31.400]  hit Houston hard tomorrow and then I think it's gonna hit Louisiana hard on
[03:46:31.400 --> 03:46:35.760]  Sunday exactly despite the fact we say this and I get it too because you don't
[03:46:35.760 --> 03:46:38.640]  believe it and all sudden the little screams at Austin we're not even on the
[03:46:38.640 --> 03:46:42.800]  coast go up and like it's barely rushing suddenly it is rushing don't drive
[03:46:42.800 --> 03:46:48.200]  across streams stay in your house get to high ground hundreds are gonna die if
[03:46:48.200 --> 03:46:51.600]  people don't listen thousands are hundreds die each time this is a big
[03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:57.000]  fat storm full of water dumping they're saying minutes you know inches a minute
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:01.960]  and so what this is gonna hit Texas hard and we need to pray for folks but
[03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:05.600]  people need to get to high ground and they do need to evacuate fact I told you
[03:47:05.600 --> 03:47:10.400]  guys this morning I know who's gonna go I just said pick a hotel 50 miles from
[03:47:10.400 --> 03:47:14.360]  the coast don't be down there low in that area do whatever you want you're
[03:47:14.360 --> 03:47:17.360]  driving along on my Ford truck was pretty slick done it that's like seven
[03:47:17.360 --> 03:47:22.120]  years awesome truck the point is is that you need to be there be safe to show
[03:47:22.120 --> 03:47:26.360]  the stores show the people do the reports live in the stores at night show
[03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:30.920]  the folk but be safe okay Owen well it's gonna have the coverage of this Alex
[03:47:30.920 --> 03:47:33.200]  we're gonna be boots on the ground we're gonna be fearless we're gonna do
[03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:38.280]  exactly what our audience expects from us but just on a closing note I do agree
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:41.560]  with you I think there's gonna be some serious devastation with this however
[03:47:41.560 --> 03:47:46.880]  sadly I think that this can be used as a good time for America to unify you know
[03:47:46.880 --> 03:47:51.360]  to remember that we're all one country we're all together in this and when one
[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:55.240]  of us suffers as Trump has said we all suffer so this is gonna be big for
[03:47:55.240 --> 03:47:59.120]  America to come together do not let this hurricane my next point did you know
[03:47:59.120 --> 03:48:02.560]  liberals everywhere I saw this from Paul earlier I couldn't believe I just
[03:48:02.560 --> 03:48:07.920]  searched it tens of thousands of tweets saying kill Texas kill Florida kill
[03:48:07.920 --> 03:48:11.720]  Louisiana they deserve it because they're Republican a third of the people are
[03:48:11.720 --> 03:48:16.040]  more a Democrat they are so crazy they want everybody to die the Democrats do
[03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:22.040]  because Texas is Republican what the hell well I think that we're gonna I
[03:48:22.040 --> 03:48:24.920]  think that America is gonna come together after this I think people are
[03:48:24.920 --> 03:48:28.400]  gonna be they're gonna come to help the devastation I think Trump's gonna come to
[03:48:28.400 --> 03:48:32.120]  Texas and I think I think so too and I think this will be an even though a
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:36.080]  devastating sad moment also a healing moment Alex we just went under a
[03:48:36.080 --> 03:48:40.360]  bridge there was a digital side on top of it that said warning do not travel
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:44.480]  south well we're heading south I would say in that camera right out the front of
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:49.840]  that Ford Raptors they're driving the great American big old giant vehicle
[03:48:49.840 --> 03:48:52.520]  that Al Gore actually owns one of they think you shouldn't be able to have one
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:58.280]  of there we go ladies and gentlemen we're in the Ford Raptor and hey hey show me
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:02.520]  your crew member who you got with you go ahead and show folks there's a
[03:49:02.520 --> 03:49:05.960]  great patriot let's talk to Harrison I know he's driving it real quick Harrison
[03:49:05.960 --> 03:49:10.800]  give us your take on things I gotta agree with Oman you know I looked through a
[03:49:10.800 --> 03:49:15.560]  couple hurricanes in Houston I grew up in Houston and I knew I mean after the
[03:49:15.560 --> 03:49:19.400]  hurricane hit I've never seen a neighborhood come together like after
[03:49:19.400 --> 03:49:22.840]  hurricane hit I mean neighbors just get together if you got a big truck you
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:26.200]  go drive through the water you see if anybody needs help everybody's powers
[03:49:26.200 --> 03:49:30.680]  out so I was just sitting out on the front porch and cooking out and obviously
[03:49:30.680 --> 03:49:34.400]  can't keep any of your food so you're just it just becomes a big block party so
[03:49:34.400 --> 03:49:39.240]  there is sort of this silver lining to the crowd when there is devastation like
[03:49:39.240 --> 03:49:45.560]  this all those normal little you know neighborly you know fights that you get
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:49.120]  in all that it all just falls to the wayside nobody comes together to help
[03:49:49.120 --> 03:49:53.880]  each other so I'm hoping we get some good footage of that as well well said my
[03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:56.720]  friend what a great crew member but we're a lot of great videos he's put out
[03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:59.880]  let's aim that he did the Trump's first six months videos to show the
[03:49:59.880 --> 03:50:03.200]  accomplishments let's aim that camera real quick for TV viewers info wars.com
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:06.400]  forward slash show them a skip this break so folks can see as you barrel
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:10.920]  towards the towards the old hurricane here we go you know the front of the
[03:50:10.920 --> 03:50:14.600]  car here we go folks barreling down the highway towards it be safe guys
[03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:22.440]  listeners please pray for Harrison and for Owen God bless you guys be safe
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:26.120]  all right there you go we're gonna skip this break back to Roger Stone for
[03:50:26.120 --> 03:50:32.760]  closing comments then closing comments from Mr. Hagman I cannot express the
[03:50:32.760 --> 03:50:36.680]  listeners enough that we're committed to this fight and it's not as we're heroes
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:43.520]  we're not slaves and we're gonna win and I just feel sorry for all the other
[03:50:43.520 --> 03:50:46.680]  victims of communism but we're in one hell of a fight Roger Stone closing
[03:50:46.680 --> 03:50:52.880]  comments well you call it Alex I must admit this has happened much faster than
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:57.560]  I thought it would I thought that ultimately the left would settle down
[03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:03.160]  particularly as Donald Trump moves the country towards prosperity but instead
[03:51:03.160 --> 03:51:07.920]  what we seem to have on our hands is a violent revolution a violent overthrow
[03:51:07.920 --> 03:51:12.560]  of the constitutionally elected government with half of the media
[03:51:12.560 --> 03:51:19.880]  defending it or promoting it it is all my predictions on TM and TMZ I
[03:51:19.880 --> 03:51:25.640]  stand by you are going to have a bloody civil war we're not advocating it we
[03:51:25.640 --> 03:51:30.240]  don't condone it we're not for it but it's not but we are not the ones
[03:51:30.240 --> 03:51:34.440]  provoking it yeah that's right we're not gonna take it once they swing why
[03:51:34.440 --> 03:51:39.400]  would we I mean I think we're the ones committed to a democratic or
[03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:43.720]  constitutional system and notice we're winning that way we're winning we're
[03:51:43.720 --> 03:51:51.240]  winning that way or worse but we have accepted the results they refuse to
[03:51:51.240 --> 03:51:57.160]  accept the people's mandate here it's it's unlike anything I've seen in 40
[03:51:57.160 --> 03:52:01.160]  years in politics well you know I got contacted by some high-powered lawyers
[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:06.440]  through my lawyers and they said yeah they're gonna indict a Hollywood person
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:09.440]  to promote supplements to make it look like they're not going after you and
[03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:12.360]  they even did it like a month later when it's Paltrow Alex Jones soul
[03:52:12.360 --> 03:52:16.360]  supplements arrest him now they've got the indictments in California to put her
[03:52:16.360 --> 03:52:21.880]  in jail for selling mainline supplements everybody else does so they go oh we got
[03:52:21.880 --> 03:52:27.080]  Paltrow it like we don't know don't they get like it's gonna come out they'll
[03:52:27.080 --> 03:52:30.560]  understand what this isn't like we're blind like their poor average
[03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:35.000]  constituent they're selling crack to we are awake we are ready we're going to
[03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:42.080]  win Roger well I've just been told that a some radical left-wing group has filed
[03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:49.640]  a complaint against me with the FBI claiming that I have threatened members
[03:52:49.640 --> 03:52:56.160]  of Congress when I said that in my opinion no member of Congress who voted
[03:52:56.160 --> 03:53:01.160]  for impeachment would be safe what I said that would that they would be taking
[03:53:01.160 --> 03:53:07.520]  their lives in their own hands my lawyers will handle this filing a false
[03:53:07.520 --> 03:53:14.400]  complaint with the FBI is of course a crime but I it's Democrats on TV saying
[03:53:14.400 --> 03:53:19.240]  hashtag hunt Republicans once Calise was shot they're the ones cop killing all
[03:53:19.240 --> 03:53:23.680]  we're saying is you little limp dicks want to fight you're about to get one
[03:53:23.680 --> 03:53:31.600]  once you launch it this was a posted by some dipshit named Scott Dworkin calls
[03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:39.720]  himself a funder on Twitter this is the kind of harassment that the Patriots
[03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:45.600]  like you and I are forced to put up with all right Roger we're gonna be doing
[03:53:45.600 --> 03:53:48.600]  live broadcast throughout the weekend please join us for them with the
[03:53:48.600 --> 03:53:52.880]  hurricane other events but they are admittedly planning a overthrow of
[03:53:52.880 --> 03:53:56.560]  local government killing all the cops I mean you can't make this up I'm on
[03:53:56.560 --> 03:54:00.120]  world in a fantasy world but they're crazy we're gonna win thank you Roger
[03:54:00.120 --> 03:54:05.280]  Stone stonecultured.com we'll talk to you soon many thanks Alex all right let's
[03:54:05.280 --> 03:54:09.320]  go back to Doug Hagman Doug Hagman of course has a lot of great websites but
[03:54:09.320 --> 03:54:12.920]  his work has been impeccable I mean I remember hearing him like 15 years ago
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:16.040]  and coast to coast and thinking man that sounds a little wild and then a lot of
[03:54:16.040 --> 03:54:18.320]  year later it came true and I was like okay well maybe he's a little bit
[03:54:18.320 --> 03:54:21.400]  credible he was one of the first guys I heard like David Horowitz say they're
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:25.520]  gonna merge with the Al Qaeda and the radical Islam and criminal groups in the
[03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:29.040]  government are working with Islam and I was a little not as sophisticated I'm
[03:54:29.040 --> 03:54:31.840]  like now it's criminals in the government letting it happen because it was
[03:54:31.840 --> 03:54:36.600]  worse than that so he just over and over again has broken them the wiener story
[03:54:36.600 --> 03:54:39.480]  over and over again he's got these documents from his investigators and
[03:54:39.480 --> 03:54:43.320]  sources they're getting ready to go and I and you can see it though it's not
[03:54:43.320 --> 03:54:46.680]  like I'm not taken away from what he said it's like they're saying it
[03:54:46.680 --> 03:54:50.400]  everywhere they're there and then he gets the inside intel of them waiting in
[03:54:50.400 --> 03:54:56.600]  their cells to go out and have this ride of passage and it's just closing
[03:54:56.600 --> 03:55:00.920]  comments a Doug Hackman on where we are right now yeah well I'll tell you I think
[03:55:00.920 --> 03:55:04.760]  we're in the we're living in the most perilous time in American history in
[03:55:04.760 --> 03:55:09.200]  modern times anyway what we're doing since our founding this is just this is
[03:55:09.200 --> 03:55:15.440]  this is the same level yeah yeah and I think people especially conservatives
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:21.360]  and Christian conservatives we need to wake up they need to wake up they need
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:28.040]  to get their heads out of their butts and see what's going on we cannot allow we
[03:55:28.040 --> 03:55:32.520]  cannot allow you got to go to city council you got to call C-span you got
[03:55:32.520 --> 03:55:37.200]  to get call talk ready you got to get aggressive now exactly otherwise I mean
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:44.160]  yeah lead follow or get out of the way it but but do something and I'm so
[03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:52.120]  impressed with with all with our collective efforts here look we are if
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:57.240]  we don't fight if we don't fight back that is we are we are going to be
[03:55:57.240 --> 03:56:01.000]  ultimately wounded what Roger Stone just went through with respect to the FBI
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:05.960]  look we go through the same thing the harassment the the law fair the
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:11.360]  accusations of whatever all he said this or that this is the asymmetrical war
[03:56:11.360 --> 03:56:15.680]  in which we find ourselves and I'll tell you something it gets rather old rather
[03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:20.960]  fast tie us down and defending ourselves yeah exactly and it costs money it
[03:56:20.960 --> 03:56:25.200]  it doesn't you can have the craziest accusation out there it costs money to
[03:56:25.200 --> 03:56:29.120]  defend yourself and this is how they want to bankrupt the alternative or new
[03:56:29.120 --> 03:56:34.880]  media or independent media and continue to harass us but the bottom line most
[03:56:34.880 --> 03:56:40.320]  perilous time in human history the reprieve that we may have gotten so
[03:56:40.320 --> 03:56:44.520]  that Christians talk about under Donald Trump have we squandered that perhaps but
[03:56:44.520 --> 03:56:48.520]  but you better wake up and understand that you are in the crosshairs I'm sorry
[03:56:48.520 --> 03:56:53.760]  this is the enemy counter-offensive absolutely and and you know what we
[03:56:53.760 --> 03:56:59.320]  unite or we die we fight or we die and I'm I ain't ready to die in the fact in
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:04.080]  the fact of the matter is I'm not gonna leave this mess are you not more alive
[03:57:04.080 --> 03:57:07.160]  than ever aren't you feeling good actually at least we've engaged them
[03:57:07.160 --> 03:57:10.640]  we've got a beachhead we're making them counter-strike we're drawing them out in
[03:57:10.640 --> 03:57:13.680]  the open they're not gonna just creep around and brainwash our kids anymore
[03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:16.720]  we're gonna face them out there with their rifles we're gonna force them to
[03:57:16.720 --> 03:57:21.560]  come out and start killing us exactly yeah it's it's now or never and you know
[03:57:21.560 --> 03:57:27.000]  I look at this and I'm not gonna allow my offspring to walk past my grave my
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:31.280]  tomb and say you know he could have done something he did nothing and spit on
[03:57:31.280 --> 03:57:34.400]  spit on my my tomb I'm gonna be out there I'm gonna be fighting I'm gonna be
[03:57:34.400 --> 03:57:39.800]  leading the charge along with people like you yourself and people like you and
