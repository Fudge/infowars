[00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:08.626]  Another time.
[00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.152]  In the Age of Wonder.
[00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:35.833]  I've said this many times and it's always been true, but as the world quickens, as time and space and technological developments
[00:00:53.169 --> 00:01:03.732]  Accelerate as populations explode, as knowledge increases, but also ignorance, for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:15.956]  As time and space piles on, it is harder and harder to even try to scratch the surface of the incredible developments, but somehow I've got to do it today.
[00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:20.457]  Because each story has other stories that are corollary that give you the big picture.
[00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.941]  We have Hurricane Harvey hysteria.
[00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:33.983]  Customers all over Texas fight a store sellout of water and other key staples.
[00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:37.444]  Why do people never have the basic staples, most folks?
[00:01:37.444 --> 00:01:41.285]  And then images from space are just unbelievable.
[00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.405]  Like I said, it's from the International Space Station.
[00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:49.387]  If you're watching us on television, we are a radio slash television transmission.
[00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:51.147]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:54.694]  But our report is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.435]  Hurricane Harvey Hysteria.
[00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:00.756]  And they're calling it the perfect storm.
[00:02:00.756 --> 00:02:02.256]  No pun intended.
[00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:04.477]  Harvey to make landfall as Cat 3 Hurricane.
[00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:06.217]  40 inches of rain.
[00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.818]  Latest updates.
[00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:11.518]  I'm looking to send some reporters down there right now.
[00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:14.919]  Worst case scenario looms for Texas with Hurricane Harvey.
[00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:17.946]  Storm of the decade.
[00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:19.427]  Perfect conditions.
[00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:21.848]  Could make Harvey the strongest hurricane to hit the U.S.
[00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.309]  in 12 years, as Texans are told.
[00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:31.512]  Get out of Dodge before 130 mile an hour wind and rain cause alligator infested floods.
[00:02:31.512 --> 00:02:32.733]  It's actually true.
[00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:36.214]  They took the ban on hunting alligators off of 10 years ago or something.
[00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:38.556]  They were like running around like roaches.
[00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:40.676]  My son killed three just a few years ago in one hunt.
[00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:44.498]  One of them 10 feet long.
[00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:45.999]  That's bigger gators in Louisiana now.
[00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.260]  So Hurricane Harvey could be a flooding disaster, a storm stalls over Texas.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.020]  They get three inches in Houston, they flood.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.481]  They're talking 40 inches and it's building, it's accelerating.
[00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.842]  And it's set to start hitting tonight.
[00:03:01.842 --> 00:03:03.162]  This thing kind of crept up on us.
[00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.043]  It was first, it's a tropical storm in Category 1.
[00:03:06.043 --> 00:03:07.763]  We're not sure, you know, sure.
[00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:11.104]  Category 2, Category 3 accelerating right towards
[00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.934]  Texas going to hit around Corpus Christi, Port Aransas.
[00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:19.276]  They haven't been hit in decades there by a bad hurricane.
[00:03:19.276 --> 00:03:22.959]  And then turn up the coast and rampage up through Houston.
[00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.823]  But part of it hits Austin and San Antonio, but that's the left flank.
[00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:36.911]  If it keeps its track, it is going to devastate Houston and the entire area north of Corpus Christi and Port Aransas.
[00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:38.392]  One of my favorite fishing spots down there.
[00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.590]  So it is barreling in, folks.
[00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.971]  Our prayers are with all the folks that are down there.
[00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:47.873]  Now that said, there's the other big giant news.
[00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:56.257]  We broke back on August 4th with Jack Posobiec, who'd been in meetings with folks from the White House who were told, you don't visit InfoWars.com.
[00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:03.513]  And then of course the media totally ignored that, even though it came directly from high-level sources.
[00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:07.555]  Well, it's now in USA Today, Politico broke it.
[00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:13.418]  Oh my gosh, the exact words we said have now been confirmed by basically...
[00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:15.496]  General Kelly.
[00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:19.100]  And his argument is, well, he's keeping all news from the president.
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.464]  But those sites are, I guess, some of his particular favorites.
[00:04:22.464 --> 00:04:24.046]  So the people can't just do walk-ins.
[00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:28.611]  And they're real worried about his son, Donald Jr., bringing him stuff.
[00:04:28.611 --> 00:04:29.792]  And then the media tries to spin it.
[00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:30.954]  They're saying it's fake news.
[00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:40.580]  Yeah, fake news like you were going to win the election, the polls are off, or fake news that the president was getting ready to get rid of Rince Priebus and Spicer.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:52.324]  We said they'd get rid of him on a Friday, and they got rid of him on a Friday, or all the hundreds of other big things we told you that came true, just like we told you that Kelly had done this two and a half weeks before anybody else did.
[00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:57.405]  Oh, and then there's the big news, the other fake news, running the headline that I have proof Michelle's a tranny.
[00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:05.201]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:04.542]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:15.179]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had
[00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:17.601]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:24.245]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:26.787]  And so I set out to develop Caveman.
[00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:33.412]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:06:33.672 --> 00:06:34.613]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:05.598]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:06.521]  What does Stephen Bannon call the fight against the globalists?
[00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:08.062]  He calls it a war.
[00:08:08.062 --> 00:08:09.303]  An information war.
[00:08:09.303 --> 00:08:13.184]  Why do you think the globalists are after us so much?
[00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:33.011]  Why do you think they're demonizing me so much?
[00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:43.175]  Why do you think they're coming after us on every conceivable front with straw men and so many other forms of deception?
[00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:44.916]  It's because the globalists know
[00:08:46.832 --> 00:09:08.825]  That we have their number and that we're aware of their operations and we've read their books and read their publications and understand they're establishing a private corporate world government that controls all the major parties and creates a synthetic form of consensus to bring in a post-industrial anti-human new dark age.
[00:09:08.825 --> 00:09:10.186]  And that's their words, not mine.
[00:09:11.147 --> 00:09:14.228]  An authoritarian technocracy.
[00:09:14.228 --> 00:09:16.509]  Where the future doesn't need humanity.
[00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:17.929]  And where we're obsolete.
[00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:23.651]  These are the big issues that should unify all of us.
[00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:26.312]  But instead they make it a partisan issue.
[00:09:26.312 --> 00:09:28.613]  Then they have the Democratic Party attack you.
[00:09:28.613 --> 00:09:31.334]  And you can't help but then fight back in a partisan way.
[00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:35.795]  Because the only folks organized to battle back against it are the Republicans.
[00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:38.036]  But half of them are neocon globalists.
[00:09:38.939 --> 00:09:42.884]  Collaborators, and so you're surrounded, basically, in a pincer attack.
[00:09:42.884 --> 00:09:46.668]  But the good news is the people of the world are waking up.
[00:09:46.668 --> 00:09:53.436]  Authoritarian, unelected globalism is in trouble, and the elites admit that in their own internal publications and in leaks.
[00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:57.140]  So, we have right on our side, we have history on our side, we have the numbers.
[00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:04.467]  And we are beginning to transcend their propaganda, but they are intensifying their old tricks to the next level.
[00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:11.292]  We're going to cover this very dangerous hurricane, the worst they're saying to hit the United States in more than 12 years.
[00:10:12.998 --> 00:10:21.444]  We've seen record low hurricane activity in the last 12 years, but now Hurricane Harvey is coming barreling in, set to hit later this evening.
[00:10:21.444 --> 00:10:40.518]  Reportedly, we can put the track up on screen for folks, is going to rampage up the coast, hitting somewhere around Corpus Christi and Port Aransas, and then turning to the east and plowing up through the central eastern part of the state.
[00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:50.665]  We'll be able to cover the hurricane from right here in Austin, Texas, but I am talking to my brave reporters to see who wants to bite the bullet or draw the short straw.
[00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:52.366]  Walled horses couldn't drag them away.
[00:10:52.366 --> 00:11:05.873]  To jump in the old Ford F-150 I've got here for the office vehicle and drive down close to the coast to show the bare shelves, the people fighting over water that's being reported, and to show the big evacuation.
[00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:18.980]  I don't think we need our guys to be there when it makes landfalls or the famous image of the reporter blowing around, you know, in their rain suit or in their raincoat.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:30.346]  But we want to just show how precarious civilization is and how a storm or an earthquake or a war or a disease outbreak can destabilize things so incredibly quickly.
[00:11:30.346 --> 00:11:32.387]  So that's coming up and is absolutely key.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.801]  We've got Jack Posobiec joining us.
[00:11:35.801 --> 00:11:43.265]  He broke back on the 4th of this month, two and a half, three weeks ago.
[00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:48.627]  White House staffers, if you like InfoWars or Milo, you're fired.
[00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:51.889]  And basically said it's banned in the White House and don't show it to the President.
[00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:55.951]  Of course, no media that's fake picked it up.
[00:11:55.951 --> 00:12:01.634]  All the real media did pick it up and
[00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:16.735]  Now it's in Politico, it's in the New York Times, in the Washington Post, it's in BuzzFeed, that indeed we are dead on accurate and exactly as we said has now been confirmed and reported.
[00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.478]  But notice they don't give Jack Posobiec credit.
[00:12:21.252 --> 00:12:31.960]  I have Charlie Wurzel's number from BuzzFeed and an organization that poses as reporters, you know, their PPGate comic book fantasies and the rest of it that they write fiction on.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.843]  And I text messaged him and I said, are you going to add this to your story?
[00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:36.284]  The Jack Posobiec broke it word for word.
[00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:51.842]  He has a good point, he texted back, but I didn't really get clarification on whether he's going to update the story at the top to say, wow, InfoWars is right again, just like we called exactly when Priebus and others would be fired and who would be brought in.
[00:12:52.847 --> 00:13:05.131]  Just like we told you about the smart meter spying on you and the bisphenol A causing you to have sexual cancers, you know, in your organs and all sorts of other problems and infertility.
[00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:10.953]  Everything we talk about is basically in the main literature, the scientific literature.
[00:13:10.953 --> 00:13:14.314]  It's just not in pop culture.
[00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:19.915]  So I had countless people, I mean, many people walked me in Seattle and go, you are a liar.
[00:13:19.915 --> 00:13:20.456]  I'd go, why?
[00:13:20.456 --> 00:13:21.656]  And they'd go, gay frogs!
[00:13:23.749 --> 00:13:24.949]  And I'd go, well, that's not true.
[00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:27.130]  A lot of you saw the live feeds on the streets.
[00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:27.990]  I go, that's not true.
[00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.871]  That's funny then, huh?
[00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:38.634]  But I go, let me just show you here on this, on my computer, on my phone, hundreds of studies about Atrazine causing about half the frogs in most of the U.S.
[00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:40.454]  to be bisexual or sterile.
[00:13:40.454 --> 00:13:41.355]  They said, I don't want to look at it.
[00:13:41.355 --> 00:13:43.936]  You're a, you're a Nazi.
[00:13:43.936 --> 00:13:45.456]  And I'd say, don't you care about your kids?
[00:13:45.456 --> 00:13:47.617]  One guy had his kid with him.
[00:13:47.617 --> 00:13:49.377]  This runoff's causing cancer, serious problems.
[00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:51.098]  He said, no, I care about Nazis.
[00:13:53.424 --> 00:13:54.345]  And I'm like, I understand.
[00:13:54.345 --> 00:13:55.365]  You're Captain America.
[00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:57.887]  You found a Nazi now.
[00:13:57.887 --> 00:14:00.749]  This isn't live-action role-play, bro.
[00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:02.671]  I'm a real person.
[00:14:02.671 --> 00:14:04.873]  The Globalist created the Nazis.
[00:14:04.873 --> 00:14:06.734]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:07.715]  The Cold Springs Harbor.
[00:14:07.715 --> 00:14:08.435]  IBM.
[00:14:08.435 --> 00:14:10.337]  They're the ones fighting me.
[00:14:10.337 --> 00:14:11.998]  You know what, Nazi?
[00:14:11.998 --> 00:14:13.379]  F off.
[00:14:13.379 --> 00:14:22.045]  I'm like, yeah, it just feels good to say you found a Nazi and shake your finger at them, because Tom Brokaw told you with no proof, and MSNBC said,
[00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:32.554]  I'm actually here exposing this program that's declassified to literally sterilize your children, and it'll give you breast cancers, it's a secular cancer, you name it.
[00:14:32.554 --> 00:14:34.735]  I mean, just a few of these chemicals.
[00:14:34.735 --> 00:14:36.635]  They don't want to hear it, folks.
[00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:38.616]  They're already committed to the lie.
[00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:39.836]  It feels good.
[00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:41.237]  They feel smug.
[00:14:41.237 --> 00:14:43.798]  They're part of the establishment, even though they're useful idiots.
[00:14:43.798 --> 00:14:44.378]  They don't want to know.
[00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:47.685]  So that's coming up.
[00:14:47.685 --> 00:14:52.548]  Also, Armed Antifa, which means pro-fascist, but they call themselves anti-fascist.
[00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:57.391]  Remember, just always invert it, and you're actually back up and down.
[00:14:57.391 --> 00:15:00.973]  Armed Antifa call for open revolution violence against police.
[00:15:00.973 --> 00:15:04.314]  We've got a bunch of videos, a bunch of special reports.
[00:15:04.314 --> 00:15:08.197]  Again, Posobiec's joining us, Leanne McAdoo, Doug Hagman, Roger Stone.
[00:15:09.469 --> 00:15:11.229]  And so much more.
[00:15:11.229 --> 00:15:17.911]  We'll probably be going live to a feed, too, from the White House with Mike Cernovich, who's been there reporting, getting a lot of key intel all week.
[00:15:17.911 --> 00:15:19.711]  He's been inside the White House all week.
[00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:30.013]  So that's going to be coming up as well as we have some excerpts of that or a little some of that live for you right here in the next three hours and 45 minutes.
[00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:35.254]  But before we go any further, I could see this coming a thousand miles away.
[00:15:35.254 --> 00:15:38.935]  Remember Trevor Noah, but also The Daily Show?
[00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:51.333]  And the late show, or whatever it's called, with Stephen Colbert, I don't really keep track of the shows, I just see the clips where they attack me sometimes.
[00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:54.195]  They attack me daily now, so there's no way to cover it at all.
[00:15:54.195 --> 00:16:09.706]  Seriously, I mean, I haven't even watched most of the new clips of them attacking me last night, the night before, but I knew what I saw, and I said it on here, about two months ago, Gwyneth Paltrow puts out her own supplement line.
[00:16:11.118 --> 00:16:15.640]  And they didn't want to look like they were persecuting just a, quote, conservative, even though they were.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.381]  So she drew the short straw.
[00:16:17.381 --> 00:16:18.142]  They picked her.
[00:16:18.142 --> 00:16:27.787]  And I said, all of our products are being bought by big think tanks, watchdog groups, The Daily Show, The Late Late Show, The Late Show.
[00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:28.547]  They're all buying it.
[00:16:28.547 --> 00:16:30.368]  They don't even hide it on the receipts.
[00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:34.351]  NBC, ABC, CBS, Time Warner.
[00:16:34.351 --> 00:16:35.231]  They're buying everything.
[00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:37.092]  D Magazine, Newsweek, Time.
[00:16:37.092 --> 00:16:40.314]  They're all buying our products and then sending them off to be tested.
[00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:47.317]  And they found that they were the cleanest out there in the Big Buzzfeed study, with a very aggressive California lab.
[00:16:47.317 --> 00:16:49.898]  But I said, look, they're not done.
[00:16:49.898 --> 00:17:02.422]  They've chosen poor Gwyneth Paltrow as the sacrificial lamb to go, oh look, we're calling for consumers, everybody to sue and go after Alex Jones, but we're throwing Gwyneth Paltrow in there as well.
[00:17:04.474 --> 00:17:07.677]  You know, because she's saying seaweed baths are good for your skin or whatever.
[00:17:07.677 --> 00:17:10.039]  I mean, that even says that at the Walgreens.
[00:17:10.039 --> 00:17:15.523]  But see, nobody's going after Walgreens.
[00:17:15.523 --> 00:17:20.227]  Nobody's going after CVS that sells colloidal silver.
[00:17:20.227 --> 00:17:25.252]  Nobody's going after Bezos that owns Whole Foods and Amazon.
[00:17:25.252 --> 00:17:30.096]  I asked BuzzFeed this morning, I said, why are you still doing all this when you know it's just to target me?
[00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:34.949]  And they couldn't even deny it, couldn't even argue, because it's true!
[00:17:34.949 --> 00:17:36.871]  And so, they're not going to stop.
[00:17:36.871 --> 00:17:38.252]  You have to understand that.
[00:17:38.252 --> 00:17:41.654]  And if they can't get a California lab to spike it, they'll find somebody to.
[00:17:41.654 --> 00:17:42.274]  They mean business.
[00:17:42.274 --> 00:17:43.915]  These people launch phony wars.
[00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:44.496]  They do it all.
[00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.177]  They're fake individuals.
[00:17:46.177 --> 00:17:48.258]  They're fake liberals.
[00:17:48.258 --> 00:17:54.463]  And so they're trying, with everything they can, John Oliver, all of them, they've launched a new
[00:17:56.246 --> 00:18:07.068]  Jordan Kepler program that's like The Daily Show that'll air five days a week where he debuted clips last night on The Daily Show saying, I play Alex Jones and I say the things he says.
[00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:07.648]  No you don't!
[00:18:07.648 --> 00:18:09.909]  You don't say anything I say.
[00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:12.909]  You're a fraud that's stolen my identity that then misrepresents it.
[00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:14.449]  But again, this is what they do.
[00:18:14.449 --> 00:18:19.870]  And then their weak-minded viewers will attack me on the street believing the things he says.
[00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.831]  This is next level psychological strawman warfare.
[00:18:24.488 --> 00:18:26.250]  So here's the new news.
[00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.012]  I told you they were doing this.
[00:18:29.012 --> 00:18:43.086]  Advertising watchdog files complaint against Gwyneth Paltrow in two cherry-picked districts of California with district attorneys calling for criminal charges against Gwyneth Paltrow for claims she made.
[00:18:43.086 --> 00:18:44.267]  Now you know how this works.
[00:18:44.267 --> 00:18:45.568]  First they're going to indict her.
[00:18:46.826 --> 00:18:49.747]  Then it's Alex Jones, even though I haven't made the claims.
[00:18:49.747 --> 00:18:50.507]  We've got the lawyers.
[00:18:50.507 --> 00:18:51.268]  We're ready.
[00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:53.309]  We're going to make major hay out of this.
[00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:55.890]  We're going to turn this around in a judo move.
[00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.690]  I know we are, because we always do.
[00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.252]  But the poor thing has got to be SWAT teamed first.
[00:19:02.601 --> 00:19:27.260]  Because, again, they want to make it look like it's not partisan, as if when I depose all these groups and all these people and get their emails and put private eyes on them and things we've already done to some of these groups, as if we don't already know the strategy I told you months ago, as if we're not already ready, as if we can't show that it's racketeering, as if they're not used to having someone counter-sue them, because they're not used to somebody seeing what they do and understanding their operations.
[00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:33.511]  Even if they ever got it in front of a jury, can you imagine?
[00:19:33.511 --> 00:19:40.856]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm selling the exact same product sold at Whole Foods, and they even make more claims than I do, but why am I here?
[00:19:40.856 --> 00:19:57.828]  I'm here because of my political speech, and even if you don't agree with my speech, do you believe that I should be witch-hunted and hauled in here to be fined millions of dollars or thrown in prison because I dare sell melatonin and say it's associated with better sleep when that's a fact?
[00:19:59.494 --> 00:20:01.596]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:03.577]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.798]  Their warhead of choice?
[00:20:04.798 --> 00:20:06.299]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:07.740]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.202]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.
[00:20:10.202 --> 00:20:10.902]  Are you ready?
[00:20:10.902 --> 00:20:14.125]  You can be with a Sol-Ark EMP-hardened solar generator.

[00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:28.067]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to go through the hurricane and how serious it is.
[00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:29.328]  This is not hype.
[00:24:29.328 --> 00:24:31.549]  Folks, no, I don't hype hurricanes unless they're really serious.
[00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:33.010]  This is serious.
[00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.091]  And I've got family directly in the line of it.
[00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:38.613]  I tend to have reporters down there covering it today and tomorrow.
[00:24:38.613 --> 00:24:39.893]  The aftermath is what's key.
[00:24:40.974 --> 00:24:46.678]  Our stories on DrugsReport.com, Hurricane Harvey hysteria, customers fight as stores sell out of water.
[00:24:46.678 --> 00:24:55.703]  See the videos, see the photos at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and of course DrugsReport.com.
[00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:58.225]  The mighty Drugs Report.
[00:24:58.225 --> 00:25:00.126]  Boy, the globalists hate that that organization exists.
[00:25:01.923 --> 00:25:06.386]  We're also going to get into the total hysteria where Pelosi doesn't know where she is again.
[00:25:06.386 --> 00:25:18.633]  She's calling Trump George W. Bush again and says the Constitution does not say that a person can yell wolf in a crowded theater.
[00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:20.494]  I don't know who has worse dementia.
[00:25:20.494 --> 00:25:28.599]  I don't know if it's her or if it's Maxine Waters, but these people are out of their minds.
[00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:34.213]  And then they're the ones setting up a commission to look if Trump has dementia?
[00:25:34.213 --> 00:25:35.194]  I'm not kidding!
[00:25:35.194 --> 00:25:42.317]  In fact, there's Democrats, I saw it on CNN this morning, are saying that they're gonna be on this commission!
[00:25:42.317 --> 00:25:47.180]  And the question was, will they be bipartisan or fair?
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.321]  That's a joke!
[00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:54.464]  It's like, again, saying, will Hitler sit in judgment of himself at Nuremberg?
[00:25:54.464 --> 00:25:58.226]  But the question is, they're the ones that obviously
[00:25:59.548 --> 00:26:04.671]  They've had more Botox than anybody else in history and don't know what planet they're on!
[00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:10.454]  Aleppo is where, in Korea, where Putin attacked Korea.
[00:26:10.454 --> 00:26:14.757]  President Bush, he needs to learn that he's a problem!
[00:26:14.757 --> 00:26:18.999]  They don't know what planet they're on!
[00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:20.920]  So, that's coming up.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.521]  So many clips.
[00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:23.482]  So many guests today.
[00:26:23.482 --> 00:26:25.343]  But first, let me get back to Gwyneth Paltrow.
[00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:33.650]  The poor thing, when I saw it, because these things go out in talking points from the Democratic Party and from Hillary and through Zucker and others.
[00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.231]  I mean, it's admitted.
[00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:39.492]  So the exact same scripts everywhere, every major comedy show, starting two months ago.
[00:26:39.492 --> 00:26:47.613]  Oh, look at Gwenda Paltrow, she's a kook, she's a nut, she's evil, supplements are bad, none of them work, you know, she's totally insane.
[00:26:47.613 --> 00:26:53.555]  Oh, and look, she sells some of the same type stuff that Alex Jones does.
[00:26:53.555 --> 00:26:54.935]  And I went, that poor thing.
[00:26:56.141 --> 00:27:02.346]  That poor thing, they've just chosen to burn her so that... Oh, we're not just singling out Alex Jones!
[00:27:02.346 --> 00:27:03.948]  Look, we got Gwyneth Paltrow too!
[00:27:05.265 --> 00:27:11.067]  They won't go after Bezos who owns Whole Foods and Amazon, the biggest seller of supplements, and some really bad ones.
[00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:14.948]  Whole Foods sells the highest quality right down to stuff that's known to be bad.
[00:27:14.948 --> 00:27:19.549]  I mean, hell, you can go to the big stores at the malls, we all know the name, they got sports enhancers.
[00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:26.271]  They've tested their stuff and they find amphetamines sometimes in the sports enhancers because I guess it works.
[00:27:26.271 --> 00:27:28.752]  They try to put stuff in there that works even though it's illegal.
[00:27:30.094 --> 00:27:35.616]  That's why they're always catching sports enhancement stuff, you know, filled with stuff, but that's not supplements, that's not nutrients.
[00:27:35.616 --> 00:27:40.237]  That's why they studied ours and said it's just really well-known herbs.
[00:27:40.237 --> 00:27:46.479]  In fact, none of it's really fancy or, you know, really complex.
[00:27:46.479 --> 00:27:51.781]  Yeah, it's staple, concentrated, cold-pressed, and other systems, exactly.
[00:27:52.648 --> 00:27:59.991]  And now, advertising watchdog files complaint against Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, that's her company, for deceptive health claims.
[00:27:59.991 --> 00:28:02.232]  How dare she said some health and wellness events she put on?
[00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:06.134]  Don't want Hollywood to get into that, because only Bezos is allowed to make the money.
[00:28:08.226 --> 00:28:16.811]  In response, Goop says TINA.org provided limited information and made threats under arbitrary deadlines which were not reasonable under the circumstances.
[00:28:16.811 --> 00:28:36.381]  It goes on to say a Madison, Connecticut-based nonprofit that describes itself as dedicated to empowering consumers to protect themselves, and then it goes on from false advertising, cites 51 examples in which Goop touts products on her site either seriously or implicitly, and then it goes on to say that they've gone to two different
[00:28:39.727 --> 00:28:54.423]  Chief Attorneys, District Attorneys in two counties in California, just like they used Travis County to go after Republicans, and that they're calling for her to be indicted, basically, for criminal activity.
[00:28:54.423 --> 00:28:55.904]  That's what it says right here.
[00:28:58.024 --> 00:29:00.766]  It's like, oh, oh, we're not targeting Alex Jones.
[00:29:00.766 --> 00:29:03.568]  We indicted Gwyneth Paltrow first.
[00:29:03.568 --> 00:29:07.492]  And you've got all these Democrat TV shows saying, look at Gwyneth Paltrow, look at Alex Jones.
[00:29:07.492 --> 00:29:09.873]  Get them, get them, get them, get them, get them.
[00:29:09.873 --> 00:29:13.036]  They're not allowed to sell L-tryptophan.
[00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:15.138]  They're not allowed to sell melatonin.
[00:29:15.138 --> 00:29:20.222]  But I can walk in any Walgreens, anywhere else, and it just says right on the bottle, helps you have better sleep.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:33.649]  Because it's just well-known fact, but in hundreds of studies, but we don't even say that, we just say, well, we've got melatonin and L-tryptophan and valerian root and all these other things, and boy, when I personally take it, it helps me sleep.
[00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:35.170]  They're like, arrest him!
[00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.912]  Good Lord, throw that man in jail!
[00:29:37.912 --> 00:29:39.753]  Can you believe what he did?
[00:29:39.753 --> 00:29:44.317]  Support us, buy the products, throw it in their face, infowarestore.com.

[00:29:48.291 --> 00:29:52.213]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.213 --> 00:29:59.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.917 --> 00:30:05.999]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:15.264]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[00:30:15.264 --> 00:30:17.605]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[00:30:17.805 --> 00:30:18.986]  On the grasshoppers.
[00:30:18.986 --> 00:30:22.230]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:28.937]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[00:30:28.937 --> 00:30:33.401]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:40.829]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[00:30:41.189 --> 00:30:49.633]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[00:30:49.633 --> 00:30:55.615]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.
[00:30:55.615 --> 00:30:58.497]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:58.497 --> 00:30:59.037]  I'm David Knight.
[00:30:59.932 --> 00:31:01.813]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.813 --> 00:31:03.854]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.854 --> 00:31:06.756]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.756 --> 00:31:12.820]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:22.005]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:26.868]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:27.088 --> 00:31:29.533]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:37.569]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:38.550]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.754 --> 00:31:43.678]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.678 --> 00:31:47.262]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.262 --> 00:31:53.969]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.969 --> 00:31:58.153]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:06.858]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:19.514]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:32:19.834 --> 00:32:23.496]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:32:23.496 --> 00:32:30.480]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:43.347]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:32:43.347 --> 00:32:44.888]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:32:45.188 --> 00:32:51.571]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:56.514]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:33:16.988 --> 00:33:26.016]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:26.016 --> 00:33:28.097]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.097 --> 00:33:30.619]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:36.773 --> 00:33:41.461]  Everybody understands this fact, but I want you to really focus on it again.
[00:33:41.461 --> 00:33:46.208]  Because if they can take Trump down, or they can take me down, they can take you down.
[00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:47.891]  And they mean to take you down.
[00:33:47.891 --> 00:33:51.356]  They admit it, in all their publications, how much they hate you and your family.
[00:33:52.577 --> 00:34:01.081]  They admit they absolutely want to tear down God, tear down the family unit, and totally dominate the human species itself.
[00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:11.825]  That is the ultimate tyrant dream since the beginning of civilization, and they believe that they are now within grasp of that holy grail, of that satanic brass ring.
[00:34:14.036 --> 00:34:17.498]  And poor little Gwyneth Paltrow is not a mainline leftist.
[00:34:17.498 --> 00:34:19.139]  She's more of a libertarian.
[00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.059]  I've known for years.
[00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:23.181]  She was in a film exposing chemtrails made in Australia.
[00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:24.201]  I know folks that know her.
[00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:27.423]  They told me a decade ago that she was dialed in.
[00:34:27.423 --> 00:34:28.804]  Hollywood knows that.
[00:34:28.804 --> 00:34:33.326]  So they said, who are we going to burn and make an example of?
[00:34:33.326 --> 00:34:37.008]  What a burner!
[00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:39.750]  Because we've got to burn her before we burn Alex Jones.
[00:34:40.831 --> 00:34:47.315]  And it's not hard to figure out when it's the same talking points on the news and on all these so-called comedy shows that are really fake news.
[00:34:47.315 --> 00:34:49.757]  That hides behind, oh we're just comedy!
[00:34:49.757 --> 00:34:53.479]  I play Alex Jones' character and I love Hitler!
[00:34:53.479 --> 00:35:06.107]  Major movies, TV shows, HBO shows, Netflix shows, all of it, and it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:35:06.107 --> 00:35:06.427]  And now,
[00:35:10.987 --> 00:35:12.767]  You read on.
[00:35:12.767 --> 00:35:19.389]  And they filed with two district attorneys in two different counties to make sure, I guess, they get one of them that does it.
[00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:21.669]  A complaint calling for criminal charges.
[00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:22.869]  That's rarely done.
[00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:24.350]  Usually they call for civil penalties.
[00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.091]  But no, we want her criminally locked up.
[00:35:28.091 --> 00:35:29.931]  That's your Democrats.
[00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:32.451]  Yeah, we'll show everybody in Hollywood to stay in line.
[00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:34.812]  And we'll show everybody about Jones.
[00:35:34.812 --> 00:35:38.953]  We'll get some district attorney to indict him.
[00:35:38.953 --> 00:35:39.453]  Do it!
[00:35:39.453 --> 00:35:39.893]  Let's go!
[00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:45.453]  I'm so ready for this!
[00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:47.875]  You think I'm just gonna go in and say, I'm sorry, I didn't know it.
[00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:50.297]  I'm gonna go, boom, we've got your files.
[00:35:50.297 --> 00:35:51.759]  Boom, we're subpoenaing this.
[00:35:51.759 --> 00:35:53.400]  Boom, we're going after the Watchdog Group.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:36:00.286]  Boom, we're getting the files from the Daily Show and the Late Late Show and all the rest of the shows that admittedly are being directed.
[00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:09.915]  And then people inside those organizations, I know, are gonna leak us all the emails and the coordination with the Democratic Party and George Soros, because we've already been given some of it.
[00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.111]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:12.111 --> 00:36:13.092]  And guess what?
[00:36:13.092 --> 00:36:18.534]  It's already saved on servers in other countries.
[00:36:18.534 --> 00:36:22.475]  You don't just think I figured all this out on my own, do you?
[00:36:22.475 --> 00:36:25.376]  We know all about the lawyer meetings in D.C.
[00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:28.397]  and the ones in Los Angeles and the ones in Austin, Texas.
[00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:32.420]  And we know about the ones in New York.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.583]  And we know all about it.
[00:36:34.583 --> 00:36:38.669]  And we've got some of your names in some of your little emails.
[00:36:38.669 --> 00:36:43.716]  What, did you just think you were gonna destroy me and that there weren't other forces fighting you?
[00:36:43.716 --> 00:36:45.980]  You just think I'm all here by myself?
[00:36:51.033 --> 00:36:53.215]  Everybody knows I'm not gonna back down and give up.
[00:36:53.215 --> 00:36:56.197]  That's the only reason I've been given all this support.
[00:36:56.197 --> 00:37:07.485]  Because I'm not gonna waiver, I'm not gonna falter, I'm not gonna have them threaten me, my family, everything, and promise it'll all be alright if I just back down.
[00:37:07.485 --> 00:37:13.049]  No, it's gonna be alright because I'm going to run you over.
[00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:15.611]  Because I'm just the tip of the spear.
[00:37:15.611 --> 00:37:17.052]  And by the time you figure that out,
[00:37:18.666 --> 00:37:31.075]  The spear would have already gone past you, because it went through you politically, in a loving, peaceful way, and you'll never know what hit you, because it already hit you.
[00:37:31.075 --> 00:37:43.865]  You're already flailing around politically, bleeding to death, announcing how powerful you are, and putting out all your talking points, how you're invincible, and how you're unstoppable.
[00:37:43.865 --> 00:37:44.346]  But you're not.
[00:37:45.754 --> 00:38:14.091]  So, just because they're doing this, I'm gonna announce a money bomb for two weeks out, that I wanna be the biggest we've ever done for the war chest, for all these attacks that are already here, and the attacks that are coming, and you see our expansions, and our new shows, and the new reporters, and everything we're doing, to really have an even stronger war chest, just dedicated, and I'm already doing it, getting the top lawyers lined up, different sectors of the country, so they're ready, on the ground, when they launch different operations.
[00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:17.472]  Because don't you want us to win?
[00:38:17.472 --> 00:38:26.495]  But whatever you do, just go to infowarestore.com today and buy the supplements and buy the water filtration and buy the coffee that they say is a scam.
[00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:29.196]  You know, they're saying I'm making claims that coffee wakes you up.
[00:38:29.196 --> 00:38:29.696]  I'm serious.
[00:38:29.696 --> 00:38:31.437]  They're trying to get criminal charges for that.
[00:38:31.437 --> 00:38:40.020]  Because I'm a bad person, you know, selling coffee, high quality organic coffee from Mexico, high mountain, desert, actually locally sourced.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.860]  What's the term?
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.361]  Wild sources, beyond organic.

[00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.052]  And they even had groups go at them and say, this isn't real.
[00:39:13.052 --> 00:39:13.813]  Let us see your records.
[00:39:13.813 --> 00:39:15.314]  They laughed and said, sure, here it is.
[00:39:15.314 --> 00:39:17.796]  It's all real.
[00:39:17.796 --> 00:39:22.700]  You think anybody could go create tens of thousands of fake reviews, 3,000 for one product alone?

[00:39:59.282 --> 00:40:05.265]  These two formulas are the perfect super combo for supporting a healthy thyroid and supercharging your health.
[00:40:05.265 --> 00:40:10.347]  Selenium helps support the immune system, DNA production, thyroid health, and eyesight.
[00:40:11.227 --> 00:40:17.929]  True iodine helps support healthy hormone levels and healthy metabolic systems and much more.
[00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:19.130]  You die without iodine.
[00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.651]  That's not a claim, that's a fact.
[00:40:21.651 --> 00:40:23.931]  Just like, Jones claims you need oxygen to live.
[00:40:23.931 --> 00:40:25.112]  Complete conspiracy there.
[00:40:25.112 --> 00:40:26.472]  He claims coffee wakes you up.
[00:40:26.472 --> 00:40:28.633]  I got it.
[00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:33.855]  I just saw Whole Foods years ago, best-selling organic Chiapas coffee.
[00:40:33.855 --> 00:40:37.516]  I went and found out where you got it, brought it in and sell it.
[00:40:37.516 --> 00:40:40.297]  But it's okay for them to say really delicious, aromatic, organic.
[00:40:41.017 --> 00:40:42.659]  Uh, volcanic soil coffee.
[00:40:42.659 --> 00:40:45.641]  I mean, I didn't even say coffee wakes you up.
[00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:47.742]  They're saying the name Wake Up.
[00:40:47.742 --> 00:40:52.546]  You can't prove coffee wakes you up, you criminal!
[00:40:52.546 --> 00:40:55.749]  You filth!
[00:40:55.749 --> 00:40:57.630]  You ever heard such of a scammer?
[00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:58.771]  Such fake news?
[00:40:58.771 --> 00:41:00.132]  D Magazine!
[00:41:00.132 --> 00:41:01.793]  Hometown newspapers!
[00:41:01.793 --> 00:41:04.075]  Look at Jones, and they use coffee!
[00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:05.576]  And go, look at the false claim!
[00:41:05.576 --> 00:41:07.458]  We want criminal charges!
[00:41:10.171 --> 00:41:16.454]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he sold melatonin and said it made you sleep.
[00:41:16.454 --> 00:41:17.374]  But he did something worse.
[00:41:17.374 --> 00:41:23.597]  He sold coffee at five dollars a pound less than the very same stuff is at Whole Foods.
[00:41:23.597 --> 00:41:37.123]  And he called it, now get ready for this, ladies and gentlemen, that man sitting right there, that devil, sold coffee with the name Wake Up America.
[00:41:37.123 --> 00:41:39.444]  We all know America is a white supremacist term on top of it.
[00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:51.462]  Not since they emailed out an image of a white baby with an American flag in its hand at the ACLU have we seen such disgraceful, radical evil!
[00:41:51.462 --> 00:41:59.844]  We call for five years in prison and two million dollar fine on that devil!
[00:41:59.844 --> 00:42:00.764]  And this isn't even a joke!
[00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.971]  Fake news.
[00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:06.613]  The baby photos have a flag in his hand.
[00:42:06.613 --> 00:42:07.515]  Click on the tweet.
[00:42:07.515 --> 00:42:09.016]  That's a crop photo.
[00:42:09.016 --> 00:42:11.039]  Show the evil triggering American flag.
[00:42:11.039 --> 00:42:11.500]  There it is.
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:11.880]  Bingo!
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.744]  A little run of story saying I'm lying about this.
[00:42:14.744 --> 00:42:16.106]  You know, I'm supposed to be.
[00:42:16.106 --> 00:42:17.908]  But the ACLU said, we're so sorry.
[00:42:17.908 --> 00:42:18.188]  We will...
[00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:25.780]  Don't call us, literally, don't call us racist.
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.920]  No, no, don't do that!
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.501]  Not that!
[00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:28.842]  Please don't!
[00:42:28.842 --> 00:42:30.423]  I'm sorry!
[00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:32.504]  I'll do whatever you say!
[00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:34.525]  Just take my guns, my children, everything.
[00:42:34.525 --> 00:42:35.746]  Just open the borders up.
[00:42:35.746 --> 00:42:37.227]  I'll do whatever MSNBC says.
[00:42:37.227 --> 00:42:41.370]  Just don't have Tom Brokaw call me a racist.
[00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.752]  Please keep me in check!
[00:42:43.752 --> 00:42:45.553]  Oh, but the ACLU didn't get what they did.
[00:42:45.553 --> 00:42:47.694]  They sent out Kermit saying he was sorry.
[00:42:47.694 --> 00:42:49.055]  Don't you get the code?
[00:42:50.495 --> 00:42:52.357]  That's Peppy the Frog!
[00:42:52.357 --> 00:42:54.759]  The ACLU is white supremacist!
[00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:56.180]  Oh my gosh!
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:00.603]  Oh, why didn't I see the code words?
[00:43:00.603 --> 00:43:03.926]  The code words!
[00:43:03.926 --> 00:43:06.408]  Look, I'm going to the end, folks, and I'm not scared of all these attacks.
[00:43:06.408 --> 00:43:07.469]  I'm very honored.
[00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.832]  Hell, I expect sometime I'll probably hit a parking garage or something and they kill me.
[00:43:11.832 --> 00:43:13.694]  I mean, that's just the way the ball bounces.
[00:43:13.694 --> 00:43:17.017]  I chose this because somebody's got to do it.
[00:43:17.017 --> 00:43:18.118]  And not because I'm a hero.
[00:43:20.026 --> 00:43:25.490]  This is survival of the species we're talking about against a satanic pedophile army!
[00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:27.272]  You better believe I'm fighting them!
[00:43:27.272 --> 00:43:28.653]  You couldn't get me to stop!
[00:43:28.653 --> 00:43:31.415]  This isn't courage, this is instinct!
[00:43:31.415 --> 00:43:34.918]  This is absolute beyond will!
[00:43:34.918 --> 00:43:39.021]  This is compulsion!
[00:43:39.021 --> 00:43:41.383]  It'd be like if I was living back in the fifties and
[00:43:42.648 --> 00:43:47.692]  Marilyn Monroe, you know, was at her peak and she wanted to go on a date with me and I wasn't a married man.
[00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:50.234]  It's not torture having to take her out to dinner!
[00:43:51.303 --> 00:43:55.366]  I will assure you, this is a pleasure to be persecuted.
[00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.828]  A pleasure to be attacked by the pedophile army.
[00:43:57.828 --> 00:43:59.449]  It is an enjoyment.
[00:43:59.449 --> 00:44:00.850]  It is an honor.
[00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.251]  Our forebearers gave up everything.
[00:44:02.251 --> 00:44:03.932]  Their kids got killed and they died.
[00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:09.015]  And they were imprisoned on prison ships and killed and tortured to death so that we'd have this.
[00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:11.737]  And I'm upset that they're coming after me.
[00:44:11.737 --> 00:44:16.841]  I am just barely walking up the steps to join my ancestors.
[00:44:16.841 --> 00:44:20.203]  I am not even a good person yet.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.742]  And I intend to join them!
[00:44:24.742 --> 00:44:34.891]  Because everything they gave to us, they imparted will, and honor, and strength, and they transmitted it, spiritually, down through the time, through men and women, to us.
[00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:41.557]  And we now, here, are the holders of that great honor, of that great title.
[00:44:41.557 --> 00:44:45.760]  And we must be strong in the face of these satanic forces.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.341]  Please support us in fullwarrestore.com.
[00:44:47.341 --> 00:44:50.184]  Now, let me give you some really big news.
[00:44:57.529 --> 00:45:02.738]  I've not been sure about Michelle Obama being a transsexual.
[00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:07.066]  And I'm very serious when I cover this.
[00:45:07.066 --> 00:45:09.229]  Sometimes I look back and...
[00:45:10.563 --> 00:45:17.248]  It seems silly to even be covering such a subject until you realize the globalists are like a tranny cult.
[00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:22.672]  In the culture, in the media, in the TV shows, with drag racing and the rest of it, they're obsessed with it.
[00:45:22.672 --> 00:45:24.874]  And Hollywood has made countless drag movies.
[00:45:24.874 --> 00:45:28.757]  Even though they're not popular, they keep force-feeding them.
[00:45:28.757 --> 00:45:32.780]  And I just keep wondering, what's going on?
[00:45:33.951 --> 00:45:41.517]  Without even looking for it, when you're on the internet or your iPhone surfing, it gets shoved and shoveled at you.
[00:45:41.517 --> 00:45:43.839]  And you ask yourself, why is this so popular?
[00:45:43.839 --> 00:45:47.262]  And the answer is, it isn't.
[00:45:47.262 --> 00:45:51.606]  But in the minds of the elite, this must be one of their other favorite fetishes.
[00:45:54.332 --> 00:46:07.703]  Now that said, I've seen a lot of weird bulge photos of her, and I've done the Google searches with the photo to see if it's photoshopped, photo search it and seen, oh there it is, Getty Images, or there it is, Associated Press image, and it really is a bulge.
[00:46:07.703 --> 00:46:17.051]  And then you see dozens and dozens and dozens, and then medical doctors come out and say, look at her head, look at her hands, look at her shoulders.
[00:46:17.051 --> 00:46:20.754]  She has the autonomy, the Adam's apple, everything, of a
[00:46:25.325 --> 00:46:27.466]  And then a lady was at Harvard last week.
[00:46:27.466 --> 00:46:30.788]  I have the article right here out of Daily Mail.
[00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:36.011]  Let's move Malia Obama checks into Harvard dorm without Barack Obama and Michelle.
[00:46:36.011 --> 00:46:45.076]  I mean, you've got him in different videos saying, Michael and I. And we use shorter clips of the video we put out there going, oh, well, he doesn't really mean his wife.
[00:46:45.076 --> 00:46:45.536]  No, no.
[00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:48.138]  In the full clips he did, we're going to add those in links below.
[00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:51.119]  It's the number six biggest video on YouTube right now.
[00:46:51.119 --> 00:46:53.761]  I noticed when I saw it the night before, it had already been taken down.
[00:46:55.311 --> 00:46:56.191]  We hadn't posted it.
[00:46:56.191 --> 00:46:57.092]  Somebody else had.
[00:46:57.092 --> 00:47:00.493]  It had been taken down.
[00:47:00.493 --> 00:47:02.253]  It had millions of views in just a few hours.
[00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:08.415]  So we reposted under fair use, analyzing it, saying we're not against trannies, we're not against any of the stuff.
[00:47:08.415 --> 00:47:12.596]  Even though it's our free speech to be against them if we wanted to, I'm not.
[00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:13.897]  I don't hate them.
[00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:14.537]  I'm tolerant.
[00:47:14.537 --> 00:47:15.637]  I'm not out to get them.
[00:47:15.637 --> 00:47:17.638]  I just don't want our kids being sexualized by anybody.
[00:47:18.314 --> 00:47:23.542]  So I put out the headline, is this the final proof Michelle Obama is a man?
[00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:25.504]  Question mark!
[00:47:25.504 --> 00:47:29.690]  Because hundreds of publications are saying Alex Jones says she's a man.
[00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:34.037]  Alex Jones
[00:47:37.253 --> 00:47:47.601]  Says he has all this proof, and then they edit the video to not show the proof, and they edit the video to not show where I've put out the evidence, and they edit the video to leave out something even bigger.
[00:47:47.601 --> 00:47:58.109]  Nowhere in any of these articles showing you how controlled corporate media is, hundreds of them this morning, do they say Joan Rivers said it, and that's how I start the video.
[00:47:58.109 --> 00:48:03.053]  We took the video that they've basically tried to ban, put into a larger context news piece I did,
[00:48:04.767 --> 00:48:13.215]  And show Joan Rivers, right before she died mysteriously in a medical accident, saying, oh, we already have a gay president.
[00:48:13.215 --> 00:48:16.879]  Michelle and Obama, you know, she's a tranny.
[00:48:16.879 --> 00:48:18.000]  And she had dinner with them.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.723]  She was friends with them.
[00:48:20.723 --> 00:48:23.605]  And then she died because they didn't want her doing further interviews.
[00:48:23.605 --> 00:48:25.887]  So I look at it and I just say, there's no way they're that bold.
[00:48:26.806 --> 00:48:28.787]  There's no way that they're that crazy.
[00:48:28.787 --> 00:48:30.428]  There's no way that this is actually happening.
[00:48:30.428 --> 00:48:34.691]  And then, I see this video shot by a Democrat, by one of their fans.
[00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:37.852]  We've got the lady's page right here.
[00:48:37.852 --> 00:48:39.353]  She shoots the video.
[00:48:39.353 --> 00:48:43.596]  Sandy Alton Sinette.
[00:48:43.596 --> 00:48:47.938]  And she shoots it of Michelle and Obama coming out.
[00:48:47.938 --> 00:48:51.500]  Or Michael, as he calls her, he, whatever it is.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.701]  She, he, she, male, whatever.
[00:48:56.992 --> 00:49:00.695]  And she's walking down, and this is the raw video off her Facebook.
[00:49:00.695 --> 00:49:03.638]  They haven't taken that one down, just the folks that pointed it out.
[00:49:03.638 --> 00:49:14.568]  And man, folks, it's clearly either a real male member, or it's an artificial one, and they're trying to basically troll folks.
[00:49:14.568 --> 00:49:16.529]  This could be a PSYOP.
[00:49:16.529 --> 00:49:18.551]  They've done this before.
[00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:22.655]  But it's either a very elastic, rubber, false member,
[00:49:24.073 --> 00:49:27.476]  Or it's the real deal because she adjusted just like a man does.
[00:49:27.476 --> 00:49:29.318]  It's incredibly obvious.
[00:49:29.318 --> 00:49:34.883]  And it looks like there's about an eight inch rubber prosthesis.
[00:49:34.883 --> 00:49:39.687]  I mean, look, they put in the Harvard Law Review that he edited that he was born in Kenya.
[00:49:39.687 --> 00:49:41.128]  He said, I was born in Kenya.
[00:49:41.128 --> 00:49:42.830]  They have Michelle saying he was born in Kenya.
[00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:43.530]  We took the bait.
[00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:45.152]  He was born in America, folks.
[00:49:45.152 --> 00:49:46.253]  They put that out.
[00:49:47.302 --> 00:49:50.204]  Literally on purpose themselves.
[00:49:50.204 --> 00:49:51.605]  And we later confirmed it.
[00:49:51.605 --> 00:49:54.026]  He was from Hawaii, Frank Marshall Davis.
[00:49:54.026 --> 00:49:55.187]  He admitted it in his book.
[00:49:55.187 --> 00:49:58.329]  He said, I used to stay with Frank.
[00:49:58.329 --> 00:49:59.850]  My grandfather was best friends with him.
[00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.271]  It was like he was my dad.
[00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:03.633]  And then it turns out that was his dad.
[00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.494]  And we have the photos and everything.
[00:50:05.494 --> 00:50:06.775]  A famous communist.
[00:50:06.775 --> 00:50:08.956]  So of course they had to create the Kenya thing.
[00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:13.739]  Because she did marry guys as part of the deal to bring folks in as a side business.
[00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:16.301]  You know, these other men that she would marry to get them into the country on visas.
[00:50:17.722 --> 00:50:17.862]  That's
[00:50:36.665 --> 00:50:40.727]  Either it's a fake thing in her pants, or it's real.
[00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:43.248]  Because it's not photoshopped and it's not fake video.
[00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:45.008]  We've blown up the video layers.
[00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:46.829]  We know how to look for the pixelation, the manipulation.
[00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:47.869]  It's not.
[00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:54.232]  She has a sausage, a cucumber, but it's jiggling around.
[00:50:54.232 --> 00:50:54.932]  It's flopping around.
[00:50:54.932 --> 00:50:57.633]  I mean, it looks like she's packing.

[00:51:30.457 --> 00:51:31.177]  Anywhere.
[00:51:31.177 --> 00:51:34.279]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[00:51:34.279 --> 00:51:34.839]  At home.
[00:51:34.839 --> 00:51:35.499]  At work.
[00:51:35.499 --> 00:51:36.299]  In the car.
[00:51:36.299 --> 00:51:37.400]  On smartphones.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.002]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[00:51:41.002 --> 00:51:46.644]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.

[00:51:57.149 --> 00:51:57.769]  Effective.
[00:51:58.369 --> 00:52:02.814]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:52:02.814 --> 00:52:04.416]  Those times may be near.
[00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:05.337]  Think about it.
[00:52:05.337 --> 00:52:09.942]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:52:09.942 --> 00:52:14.587]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:52:14.927 --> 00:52:20.729]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:52:20.729 --> 00:52:27.432]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:52:27.432 --> 00:52:29.993]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:52:30.433 --> 00:52:33.234]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:54:02.777 --> 00:54:10.461]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Chelsea Clinton, who admits in the WikiLeaks they robbed 97% of the money from the Haitians and killed people.
[00:54:10.461 --> 00:54:12.062]  She says we're killing people.
[00:54:12.062 --> 00:54:17.025]  She's saying that Michelle Obama, or Michael Obama, is everything this site will never be.
[00:54:17.025 --> 00:54:19.466]  Honorable, brave, beloved, beautiful.
[00:54:19.466 --> 00:54:21.508]  Don't need to watch an awful video to know that.
[00:54:22.915 --> 00:54:32.986]  This is video shot by one of their fans where she looks like she's either got a rubber snake in her pants or she could be a major porn star in Hollywood, okay?
[00:54:32.986 --> 00:54:35.789]  And I'm not putting trannies down.
[00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:36.530]  So here's the deal.
[00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.152]  Joan Rivers said this and died.
[00:54:39.133 --> 00:54:49.958]  And none of the media will even cover that she had dinner with the Obamas, she was friends with them, and she was all for it, saying it's great that Obama's gay and that he's got a tranny wife.
[00:54:49.958 --> 00:54:51.979]  And it's a big joke on America.
[00:54:51.979 --> 00:54:52.979]  And then she died.
[00:54:52.979 --> 00:54:56.621]  But they don't ever show in the reports that I'm saying Joan Rivers said it.
[00:54:56.621 --> 00:54:57.461]  I was never sure.
[00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:59.342]  It was kind of a joke to me.
[00:54:59.342 --> 00:55:00.363]  I never created it.
[00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:03.044]  But now, there's footage they're trying to pull off the internet
[00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:08.192]  Well, I guess she didn't tuck it between her legs or whatever, you know, like right out of Silence of the Lambs.
[00:55:08.192 --> 00:55:10.893]  It rubs the lotions on the skin.
[00:55:10.893 --> 00:55:14.615]  Oh, you know, I'd like me a little bit.
[00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:16.196]  Look, see it for yourself.
[00:55:16.196 --> 00:55:16.956]  Here's the footage.
[00:55:16.956 --> 00:55:18.297]  It's going to go to number one on YouTube.
[00:55:18.297 --> 00:55:23.559]  If they try to take it down, you know it's the end of free speech, because I'm covering what people were already covering.
[00:55:23.559 --> 00:55:30.142]  And here comes Michelle Obama walking like a man, looking like a linebacker, way bigger than Obama, big hands, big head.
[00:55:30.142 --> 00:55:30.503]  And man,
[00:55:31.812 --> 00:55:32.973]  I guess she's a devil then.
[00:55:32.973 --> 00:55:36.317]  Maybe it's a forked tail that's six inches long.
[00:55:36.317 --> 00:55:36.757]  That's it.
[00:55:36.757 --> 00:55:38.299]  Michelle Obama's a devil.
[00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:41.442]  I've already made the joke about Obama, but maybe it isn't.
[00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:43.504]  Maybe it's a little forked tail.
[00:55:43.504 --> 00:55:44.224]  You decide.
[00:55:44.224 --> 00:55:47.147]  What is this hanging between her legs, jiggling and flopping around?
[00:55:47.147 --> 00:55:49.930]  Here it is.
[00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:50.711]  Slow it down.
[00:55:50.711 --> 00:55:52.152]  She's adjusting it?
[00:55:55.424 --> 00:55:58.750]  I mean, I've seen men my whole life, myself, adjust their packages.
[00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.494]  So I were talking about this, folks, but they're bringing it up.
[00:56:00.494 --> 00:56:01.155]  Look at that.
[00:56:01.155 --> 00:56:03.079]  She's got... Get that gun in line there.
[00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:22.657]  Since the early days of the Obama administration, citizens across the board have studied videos and photos of Michelle Obama and said, that is a man.
[00:56:22.657 --> 00:56:26.500]  And even Obama has called her over and over again, Michael.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:33.785]  But new shock footage has emerged that's being censored off the internet as fast as you can upload it.
[00:56:33.785 --> 00:56:36.667]  I'm here to ask you, what do you think?
[00:56:36.667 --> 00:56:39.990]  Because in America, it's still okay to ask questions.
[00:56:42.646 --> 00:56:52.230]  After all, there are many questions surrounding the President's past, and now people are starting to question the sexual orientation of the First Lady.
[00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:54.931]  Alex Jones has a special report on that.
[00:56:54.931 --> 00:56:59.873]  But first, here's what Joan Roberts had to say to kick the controversy into the mainstream.
[00:57:02.512 --> 00:57:06.554]  No, Michelle is a trans... I'm sorry, she's a what?
[00:57:06.554 --> 00:57:09.076]  A transgender.
[00:57:09.076 --> 00:57:09.976]  We all know.
[00:57:09.976 --> 00:57:11.377]  Oh my gosh.
[00:57:11.377 --> 00:57:16.260]  Is this final proof that Michelle Obama is a man?
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:19.662]  That's what the headlines are reading across the internet.
[00:57:19.662 --> 00:57:27.767]  I first saw this headline last night, and since then, the video has gone super viral across YouTube and other platforms.
[00:57:27.767 --> 00:57:29.107]  Alright, hit pause.
[00:57:29.107 --> 00:57:31.249]  I'm gonna come back in the next segment, play the rest of it.
[00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:38.986]  And again, they've caught people smuggling over the border parrots, snakes, in their bras, in their pants.
[00:57:38.986 --> 00:57:46.151]  One time my mom was flying back from Belize and in the bathroom when they landed in Houston, a lady pulled a parrot out of her shirt that was tied up.
[00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:47.552]  I'm not kidding, this happened.
[00:57:47.552 --> 00:57:50.313]  And she comes running out going, David, David, do I tell customs they got a parrot?
[00:57:50.313 --> 00:57:54.316]  But I went, yeah, and walked over and told them some lady just came out of there with a parrot.
[00:57:54.316 --> 00:57:55.737]  But seriously, maybe
[00:57:57.088 --> 00:58:01.452]  Maybe she dropped a little bag of jewelry in, and that could kind of jiggle around, a bunch of jewelry.
[00:58:01.452 --> 00:58:03.594]  I'm serious, I'm not sure she's a man.
[00:58:03.594 --> 00:58:05.676]  They always say I'm definitive, I created it.
[00:58:05.676 --> 00:58:08.239]  No, Joan Rivers said it.
[00:58:08.239 --> 00:58:11.582]  And that she was dead!
[00:58:11.582 --> 00:58:14.905]  They said she's in there for a regular medical deal, like somebody poured gasoline down her throat.
[00:58:14.905 --> 00:58:19.590]  They said, the technicians don't even know what happened, just fire was shooting out of her mouth.
[00:58:19.590 --> 00:58:20.491]  Like she was a dragon.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.920]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.601]  Truth is way stranger than fiction.
[00:58:25.601 --> 00:58:26.881]  I don't know what happened.
[00:58:26.881 --> 00:58:32.862]  All I know is she's got a rubber Halloween snake in her pants then, okay?
[00:58:32.862 --> 00:58:34.503]  Fine, she's not a man.
[00:58:34.503 --> 00:58:36.323]  She carries a rubber snake around in her pants.
[00:58:36.323 --> 00:58:37.763]  That's much more plausible.
[00:58:37.763 --> 00:58:40.404]  And she just has big shoulders, big head, big hands.
[00:58:40.404 --> 00:58:45.785]  Obama reportedly, you know, likes $65,000 in succulent hot dogs delivered to his house.
[00:58:45.785 --> 00:58:46.826]  It's just in the WikiLeaks, though.
[00:58:46.826 --> 00:58:48.526]  Succulent hot dogs and special sauces.
[00:58:51.138 --> 00:58:54.921]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:58:54.921 --> 00:59:02.646]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:59:02.646 --> 00:59:11.272]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:59:11.272 --> 00:59:15.674]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:59:15.674 --> 00:59:20.978]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:59:21.058 --> 00:59:21.678]  We're good.
[00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:59.732]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.732 --> 01:00:02.392]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:02.392 --> 01:00:08.973]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:12.694]  Alright, folks, let's finish up this special report.
[01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.975]  It's more powerful, obviously, visually, if you're a radio listener.
[01:00:14.975 --> 01:00:16.635]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:00:16.635 --> 01:00:19.155]  To see it, post it to InfoWars.com.
[01:00:19.155 --> 01:00:21.436]  Is this the final proof Michelle Obama is
[01:00:22.623 --> 01:00:27.147]  A man, or is she just smuggling stuff in her pants that looks like a snake?
[01:00:27.147 --> 01:00:28.588]  Here it is.
[01:00:28.588 --> 01:00:31.171]  Proof that Michelle Obama is a man?
[01:00:31.171 --> 01:00:35.594]  That's what the headlines are reading across the internet.
[01:00:35.594 --> 01:00:44.883]  I first saw this headline last night and since then the video has gone super viral across YouTube and other platforms.
[01:00:44.883 --> 01:00:48.346]  The problem is channels posting it are being deleted.
[01:00:49.383 --> 01:00:53.567]  Now I'm not saying that Michelle Obama is a tranny.
[01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.849]  And I don't hate trannies.
[01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:57.410]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:03.355]  But we have famous photos of her where it appears she has a large bulge in her pants.
[01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:08.160]  And we have Joan Roberts, who was a big fan of gays and trannies.
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:14.924]  And everything else saying, hey, we've already got our first gay couple because Michelle is a tranny.
[01:01:14.924 --> 01:01:21.107]  She died a month or so later in a freak medical mishap.
[01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:29.192]  And then you expand and look at it, the fact that in his own book that Obama wrote about growing up, he talked about being raised by a tranny.
[01:01:30.072 --> 01:01:32.113]  Nanny in Indonesia.
[01:01:32.113 --> 01:01:43.659]  So you ask yourself, there's this media obsession with trannies and Michelle keeps in public photos and videos to appear to have a very large penis in her pants.
[01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:45.100]  Her shoulders are wide.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.301]  Her face is very, very masculine.
[01:01:47.301 --> 01:01:50.043]  She looks like a tranny.
[01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:53.945]  And so you ask yourself, are the children a beard for Obama?
[01:01:54.986 --> 01:02:00.393]  And of course, Michelle Obama or Michael Obama, as he's called her in two different videos.
[01:02:00.393 --> 01:02:04.338]  Here is some of the past photos that got people thinking.
[01:02:04.338 --> 01:02:09.185]  And then Joan Rivers saying indeed that Michelle is a tranny.
[01:02:09.185 --> 01:02:10.306]  And let's be clear.
[01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:17.306]  The media has said that I am the progenitor or the creator of this theory.
[01:02:17.306 --> 01:02:19.468]  I am not the creator of this theory.
[01:02:19.468 --> 01:02:26.454]  This has been on the internet since the campaign, since he kept calling her Michael in all these press conferences and events.
[01:02:26.454 --> 01:02:29.676]  How do you call your wife Michael when it's Michelle?
[01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:33.900]  Men and women of the finest military in the world.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.683]  Most of all, Admiral Mullen.
[01:02:37.683 --> 01:02:38.043]  Deborah.
[01:02:39.878 --> 01:02:44.283]  Michael and I, Michael and I, Michael and I. Is that anything scary?
[01:02:44.283 --> 01:02:56.996]  You know, uh, well, when my, my, my, when Michelle's mad, when my, my, my, when Michelle's mad, when my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
[01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:58.124]  Ms.
[01:02:58.124 --> 01:03:00.165]  Rivers, how are you?
[01:03:00.165 --> 01:03:03.147]  You made a ton of news officiating the wedding in New York yesterday.
[01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:05.888]  Is this like a new cottage career move for you?
[01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:07.789]  I am so excited.
[01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:09.690]  And I should do very well because I don't show it.
[01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:13.953]  And do you think that the country will see the first, the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[01:03:13.953 --> 01:03:15.693]  We already have it with Obama.
[01:03:15.693 --> 01:03:17.875]  So let's just calm down.
[01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:18.155]  Got it.
[01:03:22.747 --> 01:03:23.628]  I'm sorry, she's a what?
[01:03:23.628 --> 01:03:27.170]  A transgender, we all know.
[01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:31.753]  My gosh.
[01:03:31.753 --> 01:03:33.154]  We've blown up this video.
[01:03:33.154 --> 01:03:38.718]  We have enhanced this video just shot days ago as they were visiting one of their daughters at college.
[01:03:38.718 --> 01:03:43.221]  And it doesn't look like a cell phone in her pants, in her dress.
[01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:46.363]  It doesn't look like, it looks like a cucumber
[01:03:47.183 --> 01:03:49.785]  Or something right out of the movie, Spinal Tap.
[01:03:49.785 --> 01:03:52.248]  So you watch this, you decide.
[01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:53.809]  They're public figures.
[01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:57.112]  Joan Rivers, who was friends with them, said this and died mysteriously.
[01:03:57.112 --> 01:04:01.175]  And it just makes you ask, is anything we're told true anymore?
[01:04:01.175 --> 01:04:04.038]  Because we've watched the footage, we've blown it up.
[01:04:04.038 --> 01:04:06.840]  It does not appear to be manipulated or photoshopped.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.504]  It appears from the video layers with our experts looking at it to be real.
[01:04:11.504 --> 01:04:14.466]  That's the only question we're asking is, why?
[01:04:15.741 --> 01:04:18.424]  Did Joan Rivers die right after she questioned this?
[01:04:18.424 --> 01:04:20.186]  And what does this footage mean to you?
[01:04:29.662 --> 01:04:41.271]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back, but major wardrobe malfunction there.
[01:04:41.271 --> 01:04:44.754]  And again, they use this for blackmail when they put people like this in the White House.
[01:04:44.754 --> 01:04:47.356]  Total control to basically bring down the U.S.
[01:04:47.356 --> 01:04:49.378]  anytime they want, bringing this secret out.
[01:04:49.378 --> 01:04:51.620]  That's why they arranged this and did this.
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.202]  And of course, there's a lesser magic joke on everyone.
[01:04:56.451 --> 01:04:58.573]  December 23rd, 1776.
[01:04:58.573 --> 01:05:01.916]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[01:05:01.916 --> 01:05:06.920]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.724]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[01:05:11.724 --> 01:05:14.346]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[01:05:14.346 --> 01:05:16.088]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[01:05:16.348 --> 01:05:19.349]  That the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:22.370]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:25.331]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:28.472]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[01:05:28.472 --> 01:05:34.054]  And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[01:05:34.054 --> 01:05:38.176]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right
[01:05:38.396 --> 01:05:42.421]  Not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:47.687]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[01:05:47.687 --> 01:05:53.574]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[01:05:53.574 --> 01:05:55.576]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[01:05:56.562 --> 01:06:00.727]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock.
[01:06:00.727 --> 01:06:02.028]  NymphoRestore.com.
[01:06:02.028 --> 01:06:04.110]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:09.416]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:13.160]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.703]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:16.703 --> 01:06:19.886]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:19.886 --> 01:06:23.770]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:30.936]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:30.936 --> 01:06:37.062]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[01:06:37.242 --> 01:06:38.643]  Nanosilver and more.
[01:06:38.643 --> 01:06:46.931]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:46.931 --> 01:06:55.238]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:06:56.491 --> 01:07:05.574]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:05.574 --> 01:07:13.697]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:13.957 --> 01:07:18.840]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:25.645]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:25.645 --> 01:07:32.810]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:39.854]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:39.854 --> 01:07:43.797]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:43.797 --> 01:07:44.017]  Watch me!
[01:07:44.017 --> 01:07:44.197]  Watch me!
[01:07:44.197 --> 01:07:44.498]  I got it!
[01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:12.592]  I don't care how big you are.
[01:08:12.592 --> 01:08:15.215]  I don't care how high you think you are.
[01:08:15.215 --> 01:08:17.378]  If you come for me I'm coming for you.
[01:08:35.288 --> 01:08:46.392]  And so, whether it's the President of the United States of America or any of his cabinet, we will say to them, we will resist you.
[01:08:46.392 --> 01:08:51.473]  We will not allow you to damage this country in the way that you're doing.
[01:08:51.473 --> 01:08:54.634]  We will not allow you to take us backwards.
[01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:59.236]  Not only will we resist you, we will impeach you, Mr. President!
[01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:10.263]  And so, I know that you are as inspired as I am this evening.
[01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:17.048]  I want you to know that I said and I'll say it over and over again, reclaiming my time!
[01:09:17.048 --> 01:09:20.571]  Now here's Pelosi, even stupider.
[01:09:20.571 --> 01:09:26.376]  How could the Park Service justify denying that organization their free speech rights?
[01:09:26.376 --> 01:09:29.599]  Because the Constitution does not say that a person can
[01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:47.276]  It's yell fire in a theater and you can't have pre-constraint on speech saying you think someone's going to yell fire.
[01:09:47.276 --> 01:10:01.682]  If someone says we're going to go have a rally at the Capitol to gather a group together to blow up the legislature then you have admitted criminal intent to commit criminal acts and organize criminal acts and engage in terrorism
[01:10:03.018 --> 01:10:10.560]  To influence the political process, and then you get SWAT teamed, and then you get sent to a Supermax prison!
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.282]  Whereas I didn't like the alt-right group that was out there, and neither did Jack Posobiec or Mike Cernovich or anybody.
[01:10:16.282 --> 01:10:19.123]  You know, we've been invited to speak at all those, and we said, no, it's stupid!
[01:10:19.123 --> 01:10:21.524]  We want to be inclusive!
[01:10:21.524 --> 01:10:24.965]  Not the Democratic Party that's all about division, while claiming they're trying to stop it.
[01:10:26.212 --> 01:10:29.034]  White Nationalists, KKK, they've got their rights.
[01:10:29.034 --> 01:10:32.556]  And so now because Charles Barkley came out and said, I don't care about those idiots.
[01:10:32.556 --> 01:10:33.216]  I got my own life.
[01:10:33.216 --> 01:10:33.877]  I'm successful.
[01:10:33.877 --> 01:10:34.297]  Screw them.
[01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.798]  I'm not giving attention to a bunch of losers.
[01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:39.260]  They went, oh, you're a white supremacist!
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.321]  They're calling George Foreman names because he likes Trump.
[01:10:44.056 --> 01:10:46.378]  It's insane!
[01:10:46.378 --> 01:10:55.022]  It's totally out of control, but this is the desperate Democratic Party that is now saying they're going to have a House Commission with Pelosi and with Maxine Waters on it.
[01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:55.682]  I'm not kidding.
[01:10:55.682 --> 01:10:57.683]  It was on CNN this morning.
[01:10:57.683 --> 01:11:01.886]  They're going to be on this commission about Trump's mental health.
[01:11:01.886 --> 01:11:09.990]  These women, if you watch their press conferences, it's the best unintentional comedy until you realize how dangerous they are because they're calling for
[01:11:12.056 --> 01:11:20.478]  You know, to stop Putin and his attack on Korea, as if there's not a North or South, or as if Putin's not involved in Korea, except for a small border.
[01:11:20.478 --> 01:11:24.439]  That's how crazy... And she goes, well Aleppo in Korea?
[01:11:24.439 --> 01:11:27.000]  Lady, Aleppo is in Syria!
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.561]  That's the Middle East, not the Far East.
[01:11:30.561 --> 01:11:32.982]  Not South Central Asia, Southeast Asia.
[01:11:32.982 --> 01:11:37.123]  These people... How about we have the congressman from Georgia?
[01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:37.743]  What's his name?
[01:11:39.411 --> 01:11:46.156]  The one that, Hank whatever, the one that thinks, yeah Hank Johnson, the one that thinks Guam is floating.
[01:11:46.156 --> 01:11:53.261]  And the Admiral thought he was joking, and he wasn't joking, he said, well if we put too many troops on the island, will it not capsize?
[01:11:53.261 --> 01:11:56.264]  Fancy word, you learned.
[01:11:56.264 --> 01:11:58.085]  The sailboat, you know, floating?
[01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:04.446]  Talk about Twilight Zone.
[01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:08.349]  Meanwhile, you have conversations with Trump, or you see him working 18 hours a day.
[01:12:08.349 --> 01:12:17.257]  It's like, how has this guy hardly ever stumbled his words, totally focused, incredible memory, like a machine, finishing your sentences for you.
[01:12:17.257 --> 01:12:19.960]  He's a superman compared to these people.
[01:12:23.166 --> 01:12:27.972]  Putin's in Aleppo, North Korea.
[01:12:27.972 --> 01:12:30.715]  Putin attacked North Korea.
[01:12:30.715 --> 01:12:33.699]  And George W. Bush is president.
[01:12:33.699 --> 01:12:35.581]  And the islands are floating.
[01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:40.027]  And you ask yourself, who is running things?
[01:12:41.291 --> 01:13:00.004]  Meanwhile, results, economy exploding, all these amazing things happening, and they're just trying to block it with big central banks and Goldman Sachs going, the economy's going under, the economy's going under, we're raising interest rates, Obamacare's gonna stay, you're not getting tax cuts, please, economy fall!
[01:13:00.004 --> 01:13:02.706]  And the left cheerleading, yay, depression, get Trump!
[01:13:02.706 --> 01:13:10.832]  I mean, talk about loving your servitude, talk about hating yourself, talk about mind control, talk about a cult of idiots.
[01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:18.978]  And then meanwhile, our story's up on DrugsReport.com.
[01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.779]  Hurricane Harvey hysteria.
[01:13:20.779 --> 01:13:25.562]  Consumers, customers fight as stores sell out of water.
[01:13:25.562 --> 01:13:26.863]  A Don Salazar article.
[01:13:26.863 --> 01:13:30.225]  Storm is expected to upgrade now to Category 3, which it was.
[01:13:30.225 --> 01:13:33.527]  It's Harvey to make landfall tonight, bringing 40 inches of rain.
[01:13:33.527 --> 01:13:34.667]  They hit 3 inches in Houston.
[01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:36.548]  They flood.
[01:13:36.548 --> 01:13:39.330]  Worst case scenario looms for Texas with Hurricane Harvey.
[01:13:41.013 --> 01:13:45.114]  Storm of the decade, perfect conditions can make Harvey the strongest hurricane hit the U.S.
[01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:52.856]  in 12 years as Texans are told to get out of Dodge before 130 mile an hour winds and rain cause alligator infested floods.
[01:13:52.856 --> 01:13:54.016]  It's actually true.
[01:13:54.016 --> 01:13:59.698]  Hurricane Harvey could be the flooding disaster as the storm stalls over Texas.
[01:13:59.698 --> 01:14:07.220]  There is a creek on a place we used to live in that when it rained three or four inches it would flood right up the house.
[01:14:09.932 --> 01:14:14.598]  I gotta, you know, get with my ex, walk to him on the phone and just say, you need to, she still lives there, you need to get to high ground.
[01:14:14.598 --> 01:14:16.079]  I mean, I'm sure she is.
[01:14:16.079 --> 01:14:19.023]  This is just absolutely out of control.
[01:14:19.023 --> 01:14:22.928]  I mean, there will be deaths from this, you can believe it.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.762]  And so everybody should get to higher ground and pray, pray for folks who are in Texas.
[01:14:27.762 --> 01:14:33.345]  And Trump is on it, talking to the governor, got emergency response, National Guard, federal troops already getting ready to go in.
[01:14:33.345 --> 01:14:34.966]  And it's, he failed, he failed, he failed!
[01:14:34.966 --> 01:14:38.247]  Remember during the campaign he went to Louisiana and Mississippi when it got hit?
[01:14:38.247 --> 01:14:39.148]  And Obama wouldn't?
[01:14:39.148 --> 01:14:40.449]  They just don't even care?
[01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:42.350]  They made a big deal out of Bush not doing enough?
[01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:44.130]  Brownie, you're doing a good job and all that.
[01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:45.651]  And I don't think Bush did a good job.
[01:14:45.651 --> 01:14:47.972]  The point is, Obama did ten times worse!
[01:14:47.972 --> 01:14:48.553]  But it's okay!
[01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:56.815]  Because it's all this upside-down idiot standard, and you watch, Trump's gonna fly down in the aftermath, that won't be enough.
[01:14:56.815 --> 01:14:58.256]  Everything is upside-down world.
[01:14:58.256 --> 01:14:59.697]  Joining us though is Jack Posobiec.
[01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:04.546]  For the rest of the hour, we're riding shotgun if you want to see what Leanne Mack can do.
[01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:06.667]  Jack Posobiec's incredible naval intelligence.
[01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:07.748]  Didn't make a big deal out of that.
[01:15:07.748 --> 01:15:09.469]  They're trying to get him out of the Navy now.
[01:15:09.469 --> 01:15:11.530]  Headlines across the nation last week.
[01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:23.177]  How dare the president retweet Jack Posobiec, a journalist, who didn't tell us he was in naval intelligence and he needs to be thrown out of the Navy and lose his security clearance because, you know, the crazy president likes you.
[01:15:23.177 --> 01:15:26.119]  That's like working for a foreign spy or something to have the president like you.
[01:15:26.119 --> 01:15:27.020]  That's illegal.
[01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.721]  Again, upside down world.
[01:15:28.721 --> 01:15:30.142]  And then he ran the headline.
[01:15:31.062 --> 01:15:32.704]  On August 4th, we had him on.
[01:15:32.704 --> 01:15:36.689]  White House to staffers, if you like InfoWars or Milo, you're fired.
[01:15:36.689 --> 01:15:39.532]  Went on to say General Kelly is restricting all the knowledge getting in.
[01:15:39.532 --> 01:15:46.220]  And then they go on today admitting it in Politico, New York Times, Washington Post.
[01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:49.399]  And admitting everything that Jack Posobiec broke.
[01:15:49.399 --> 01:16:06.955]  But what happens when you write over and over and over again about when somebody's going to be out, like the Chief of Staff or the White House spokesman, and you write to the day, and you write on things after things because you actually have real sources, which they admit in Politico and Reuters, Posobiec and Mike Cernovich and myself and Roger Stone have real sources.
[01:16:07.515 --> 01:16:11.698]  But to the general public, they say, oh, they're fake news, don't listen to them, but now they've got to admit it.
[01:16:11.698 --> 01:16:16.181]  So they don't want people that they admit have the real intel to let the president know.
[01:16:16.181 --> 01:16:21.024]  Oh, by the way, the former deputy director of the CIA went on CNN and said they're preparing to kill you.
[01:16:21.024 --> 01:16:26.148]  Oh, and sir, here's a report where Clapper says they're preparing to forcibly remove you.
[01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:31.491]  And here's another person from Congress saying they're shopping it, saying Republicans better get in line or we'll kill you too.
[01:16:31.491 --> 01:16:32.092]  It goes like this.
[01:16:32.432 --> 01:16:33.993]  This is going to get real hairy.
[01:16:33.993 --> 01:16:35.374]  We don't want a civil war.
[01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:40.576]  He's mentally ill and you need for yourself and your family to decide to make the right decision when this happens.
[01:16:40.576 --> 01:16:42.477]  All you got to do is keep your mouth shut.
[01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:43.398]  I've gotten the phone calls.
[01:16:46.872 --> 01:16:47.653]  That's how this works!
[01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:09.650]  Everybody should just absolutely thank you for the great work you do there in DC.
[01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:12.151]  You were right again on target because you weren't right.
[01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:13.191]  You were reporting.
[01:17:13.191 --> 01:17:14.471]  It isn't a prediction.
[01:17:14.471 --> 01:17:19.473]  You have sources that were told this by people that formerly worked for Soros.
[01:17:19.473 --> 01:17:20.713]  That's Soros people.
[01:17:20.713 --> 01:17:24.374]  And of course they've got the president so isolated because they're scared he's gonna learn all this.
[01:17:24.374 --> 01:17:24.654]  Jack!
[01:17:26.513 --> 01:17:27.914]  Yeah, Alex, that's what they're doing.
[01:17:27.914 --> 01:17:31.355]  They're trying to stifle the president's information flow.
[01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:43.740]  Because they know that when Donald Trump gets the information, they know that when Donald Trump has all access to information at his fingertips, that he will inevitably make the right decision, as he's done time and time again.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.062]  Well, I heard about this nearly a month ago, Alex, and I came on.
[01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:47.802]  We talked about it.
[01:17:47.802 --> 01:17:54.245]  I said, Alex, my sources in the White House are telling me, Janna Toner, these people, Giant DiStefano, they're going around to the staff.
[01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:57.507]  And they're telling all the staff, stop reading InfoWars.
[01:17:57.507 --> 01:18:04.993]  If you like InfoWars on your Facebook, if you put it up on your social media, they're scouring everyone's accounts to see if anyone's posted any articles.
[01:18:04.993 --> 01:18:06.514]  And if you had that, you were fired.
[01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:07.675]  You're immediately gone.
[01:18:07.675 --> 01:18:10.777]  So they started at the lower levels, and now they're working their way up.
[01:18:10.777 --> 01:18:12.038]  See, they worked their way in.
[01:18:12.038 --> 01:18:17.002]  They started there a few months ago, and that's where we first got the indications of it, because I know these people.
[01:18:17.002 --> 01:18:17.963]  I see these people.
[01:18:17.963 --> 01:18:19.684]  I'm friends with some of these people on occasion.
[01:18:19.884 --> 01:18:22.307]  I'm not going to say who though because I don't want to get them fired.
[01:18:22.307 --> 01:18:23.589]  I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble.
[01:18:23.589 --> 01:18:25.031]  I'm just telling you what's going on.
[01:18:25.031 --> 01:18:27.374]  And I think that the American people have a right to know this.
[01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:32.040]  And now it seems that they're actually funneling that information from President Trump.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:37.527]  Meanwhile, we've got people like Gary Cohn, who's now going out and bashing Trump in the mainstream press.
[01:18:37.527 --> 01:18:38.088]  So I might...
[01:18:38.408 --> 01:18:43.410]  What remains to be seen is does the president even know that this has happened because have they kept that off of his desk?
[01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:54.936]  The great news is they can keep control of what goes into his office, but they can't keep control of what he sees on TV and what he sees on his cell phone where he still has Twitter, he still has his...
[01:18:55.296 --> 01:19:00.520]  Personal social media and his legions, his millions of fans on social media, on Twitter.
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:05.444]  And that's why Twitter admittedly for three months, Twitter admittedly for three months blocks all the positive stuff.
[01:19:05.444 --> 01:19:07.125]  But then we got word to him about that.
[01:19:07.125 --> 01:19:09.527]  He learned to then go into the feeds.
[01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:11.909]  And I don't want to get into inside baseball.
[01:19:11.909 --> 01:19:15.892]  We also obviously got Trump the quotes and where they said they're going to kill him.
[01:19:15.892 --> 01:19:17.012]  He didn't know that.
[01:19:17.012 --> 01:19:19.154]  So now obviously the Pentagon was already aware of this.
[01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.195]  Now Trump's ready for that.
[01:19:20.495 --> 01:19:27.261]  I mean, they just can't, we're like, sir, they're preparing to kill you, here's what they're saying, here's the COG plan, and now we're taking action.
[01:19:27.261 --> 01:19:28.142]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:19:29.768 --> 01:19:40.972]  Yeah, they know that what we're doing is trying to expose them for stopping our movement, for stopping the movement of the New American Revolution, as many people are calling it, the New American Independence Movement.
[01:19:40.972 --> 01:19:43.933]  And they don't want the president to be associated with that.
[01:19:43.933 --> 01:19:46.274]  They want him to go right along with the new conservative line.
[01:19:46.274 --> 01:19:51.656]  And they don't want minorities, who are the majority, to have the new birthright and be part of this, because they are America.
[01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:54.217]  Jack Posobiec, a true hero, will be with us straight ahead.

[01:23:29.136 --> 01:23:30.637]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[01:23:30.637 --> 01:23:32.078]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[01:23:32.078 --> 01:23:34.539]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.

[01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:03.905]  Jack Vossobek, an amazing journalist, true investigator, patriot on the front line of the Info Wars, our guest.
[01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.288]  Riding shotgun with us throughout the hour.
[01:24:05.288 --> 01:24:06.431]  Leanne Mack is going to pop in with us.
[01:24:07.458 --> 01:24:08.918]  Uh, some analysis as well.
[01:24:08.918 --> 01:24:22.361]  You know, Atlantic Monthly, the same folks that have been organizing a military coup using continuity of government against the president, they have come out and said that the eclipse was racist because it went over areas that were not predominantly minority.
[01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:23.241]  I'm not kidding.
[01:24:23.241 --> 01:24:25.482]  So how long do they say Harvey is racist?
[01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:29.682]  Because it's going to hit an area with a lot of white folks, a lot of Hispanics, but also a lot of black folks.
[01:24:29.682 --> 01:24:31.723]  A lot of black folks on the coast of Texas.
[01:24:32.904 --> 01:24:34.386]  I guess they got good taste.
[01:24:34.386 --> 01:24:36.790]  Texas is a nice place to live and in Houston.
[01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:38.753]  So they said the Eclipse was racist.
[01:24:38.753 --> 01:24:39.855]  They were serious.
[01:24:39.855 --> 01:24:43.580]  They want to just foam in everything where all you see is racism, not opportunity.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:47.487]  Jack Posobiec, how long until they say that Hurricane Harvey is racist?
[01:24:48.991 --> 01:24:50.912]  I'm surprised they haven't yet, Alex.
[01:24:50.912 --> 01:24:52.734]  It's almost like it's right on cue for them.
[01:24:52.734 --> 01:24:53.554]  They're a little behind.
[01:24:53.554 --> 01:24:56.516]  I guess the mainstream media is still catching up to the news cycle.
[01:24:56.516 --> 01:24:58.798]  But clearly they're going to call this racist.
[01:24:58.798 --> 01:25:01.500]  They're going to view everything through the lens of race.
[01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.701]  And I've been talking to my contacts in D.C.
[01:25:03.701 --> 01:25:04.442]  and we figured out
[01:25:04.822 --> 01:25:07.685]  What essentially the main goal of all of this is.
[01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:12.829]  Their end state, Alex, is to take out the US Constitution, the US Declaration of Independence.
[01:25:12.829 --> 01:25:17.292]  We saw a CNN panel just yesterday talking about Washington and Jefferson.
[01:25:17.292 --> 01:25:21.376]  These are people that founded our country, that founded our way of... That's right.
[01:25:21.376 --> 01:25:23.858]  Once you get one statute, they all fall like dominoes.
[01:25:23.858 --> 01:25:27.400]  Then it's the Declaration, it's the Bill of Rights, it's the Constitution.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.343]  All those evil rights, let's get rid of them because they're racist.
[01:25:31.801 --> 01:25:40.674]  Exactly, so when we talk about freedom of speech and they're trying to block freedom of speech, Nancy Pelosi calling it wolf in the theater, I'm not sure maybe she was talking about Wolf Blitzer.
[01:25:40.674 --> 01:25:41.576]  We have to ask him.
[01:25:44.685 --> 01:25:46.607]  Yeah, if I see Wolf in a theater, I better not say hi.
[01:25:46.607 --> 01:25:49.049]  Mr. Blitzer, excuse me.
[01:25:49.049 --> 01:26:05.402]  So, the real goal for all of this, take out the Constitution, get away from those things to discredit them the same way they're trying to discredit the President, but at the same time, they're also using loopholes to get around the way the Constitution has our democratically elected President.
[01:26:05.402 --> 01:26:06.783]  They didn't get enough votes.
[01:26:06.783 --> 01:26:08.845]  They were counting votes for impeachment last week.
[01:26:08.845 --> 01:26:11.167]  They were trying to put together Democrats and Republicans.
[01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:11.967]  They came up short.
[01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:14.089]  That's why they're trying to push this fake
[01:26:14.728 --> 01:26:15.148]  I don't
[01:26:37.068 --> 01:26:40.953]  For the 25th Amendment, and Roger Stone allowed me yesterday to tell where he learned that.
[01:26:40.953 --> 01:26:45.959]  Remember back in May, he said, the Russian narrative will peter out, then it'll be racism, because they were already doing that before.
[01:26:45.959 --> 01:26:47.621]  They'd find some excuse, which they did.
[01:26:47.621 --> 01:26:54.590]  And then it's going to be that he's mentally ill, early onset of Alzheimer's, early onset dementia.
[01:26:55.331 --> 01:26:56.653]  He didn't just pull that out of a hat.
[01:26:56.653 --> 01:27:02.078]  He talked to major reporters that were in editorial meetings at the highest levels of some of the biggest papers.
[01:27:02.078 --> 01:27:05.281]  They were given talking points and told the whole rollout.
[01:27:05.281 --> 01:27:08.585]  That's how criminal this is, how made up it is.
[01:27:10.273 --> 01:27:19.397]  Yeah, Alex, it's like they know exactly what narrative is in the line, so they just move on one, they move on the other, they keep it going until that one completely peters out.
[01:27:19.397 --> 01:27:29.041]  And then you notice that whenever another one of these dies, another one of these false narratives, there's no apologies, there's no retractions, there's no, oh, I'm sorry, we got this wrong, we're issuing a correction.
[01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:31.362]  No, they just move on to the next one.
[01:27:31.362 --> 01:27:38.825]  So one day he's a Russian, the next day he's an agent of the Nazi Party of America, the next day he's mentally unfit for office.
[01:27:39.125 --> 01:27:46.691]  It's literally 1984, but instead of it taking place over a period of weeks, months, and years, it's instantaneous.
[01:27:46.691 --> 01:27:53.636]  It's that instantaneous shift, and they think that because of social media, American attention spans aren't as fast as they used to be.
[01:27:53.636 --> 01:27:56.559]  They're hoping that people aren't paying attention, but they're not.
[01:27:57.219 --> 01:28:12.645]  And by the way, they're popping the mayor telling me the leftists are all over Twitter now, I guess Paul Watson's doing a story, because they just see Florida as racist because it went 51% for Trump or whatever, or 52%, and they see Texas that way, so they don't understand that it's also close to half Democrats.
[01:28:12.645 --> 01:28:19.768]  They're calling for all of our deaths, saying Texas and Florida as entities are like creatures and need to be killed.
[01:28:19.768 --> 01:28:20.828]  Down with them all!
[01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.908]  Drown them all!
[01:28:21.908 --> 01:28:23.229]  America has too many rednecks!
[01:28:24.289 --> 01:28:31.975]  As is yes, Jesus cleanse, Texas and Florida show your wrath to all these racist Trump supporters I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:28:31.975 --> 01:28:42.023]  They're insane It isn't even hyper partisanship anymore Alex, you know, you never hear stories about oh, you know We want these people to be out of office because we disagree with their ideas.
[01:28:42.023 --> 01:28:44.004]  They're calling for destruction.
[01:28:44.004 --> 01:28:47.667]  They are calling for death They are calling for agitation.
[01:28:47.667 --> 01:28:48.928]  They're calling for they're using
[01:28:49.228 --> 01:28:55.652]  And they see the hurricane is the giant destroying monster attacking Texas with a big KKK ad on.
[01:28:55.652 --> 01:28:57.533]  Again, they see race everywhere.
[01:28:57.533 --> 01:28:58.654]  Hurricane, kill them!
[01:28:58.654 --> 01:29:00.975]  Oh, it's a white child on the ACLU website.
[01:29:00.975 --> 01:29:01.716]  Races!
[01:29:01.716 --> 01:29:04.718]  Oh, the holes named Lynch, Bannon.
[01:29:04.718 --> 01:29:07.079]  These are completely insane people.
[01:29:07.079 --> 01:29:08.260]  They did this during Katrina.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:13.983]  They said George W. Bush steered it into Katrina, or steered Katrina to New Orleans because it was the majority black.
[01:29:13.983 --> 01:29:16.885]  I mean, this is how people on that side think.
[01:29:18.502 --> 01:29:25.408]  And then they blame me for that, because I've just had weather weapons experts on, talking about World War, you know, Korea and Vietnam and weather weapons.
[01:29:25.408 --> 01:29:27.189]  And they misappropriate that to me.
[01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:28.270]  It's insane.
[01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:30.012]  Jack Posobiec is our guest.
[01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:35.136]  We're going to talk about the ongoing soft coup that's now gotten hot.
[01:29:35.136 --> 01:29:37.998]  Bubbles are forming at the bottom of the bowl, of the pan.
[01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:39.019]  I mean, they are moving.
[01:29:39.019 --> 01:29:39.740]  They mean business.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.121]  What do we do to stop them?
[01:29:41.121 --> 01:29:43.003]  We can beat them again, just like in the election.
[01:29:43.003 --> 01:29:44.364]  And Leanne McAdoo is coming up.
[01:29:44.364 --> 01:29:44.904]  Stay with us.
[01:29:45.825 --> 01:29:47.446]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.446 --> 01:29:56.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.391 --> 01:30:09.478]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:22.768]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[01:30:22.768 --> 01:30:39.015]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[01:30:39.495 --> 01:30:44.499]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[01:30:44.499 --> 01:30:48.722]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[01:30:48.722 --> 01:30:50.123]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:59.325]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:59.325 --> 01:31:00.807]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:31:00.807 --> 01:31:05.853]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWars Life Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:05.853 --> 01:31:09.879]  This is the True Selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:31:10.379 --> 01:31:14.521]  Every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:31:14.521 --> 01:31:19.683]  But BioTrue Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:23.145]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:31:23.145 --> 01:31:27.167]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[01:31:27.307 --> 01:31:35.392]  BioTruth Selenium is also the perfect supercharger for Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[01:31:35.392 --> 01:31:40.275]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTruth Selenium before we sell it again.
[01:31:40.275 --> 01:31:48.819]  That's InfoWarsLife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that not only help yourself and your family, but also fund our operation against the globalists.
[01:31:48.819 --> 01:31:49.360]  A 360 win.
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.421]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:52.922]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[01:31:52.922 --> 01:31:54.103]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:55.390 --> 01:32:05.977]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:32:05.977 --> 01:32:08.038]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:32:08.038 --> 01:32:10.900]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.401]  It's made in the USA.
[01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:15.523]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:16.184]  Absolutely.
[01:32:36.107 --> 01:32:47.815]  Patriots, stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:47.815 --> 01:32:51.117]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:32:51.117 --> 01:32:54.319]  Now it's time to change our bodies, with Z-Field, at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:33:03.826 --> 01:33:15.790]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:30.496]  It's illustrated very, very well in a Charlton Heston film from the 1950s, documenting the historical life of El Cid that marked the beginning of the La Reconquista of Spain from the Islamic Moors of North Africa.
[01:33:32.722 --> 01:33:35.664]  And I'm certainly not comparing myself to El Cid.
[01:33:35.664 --> 01:33:36.224]  Far from it.
[01:33:36.224 --> 01:33:47.032]  But the globalists have chosen me after Trump as the symbol they want to destroy to try to kill the nationalist reawakening movement.
[01:33:47.032 --> 01:33:48.273]  Because they fear us.
[01:33:48.273 --> 01:33:49.634]  Because we're inclusive.
[01:33:49.634 --> 01:33:50.734]  We're open.
[01:33:50.734 --> 01:33:53.736]  They fear Roger Stone because he's inclusive and open.
[01:33:53.736 --> 01:33:55.858]  He's trying to get Trump to decriminalize marijuana.
[01:33:56.218 --> 01:33:58.219]  We win the whole thing if he does that.
[01:33:58.219 --> 01:33:59.339]  Just do it!
[01:33:59.339 --> 01:34:02.441]  He has no idea how that will get the leftists to finally wake up, a lot of them.
[01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:05.962]  And that was Trump's inclination during the campaign.
[01:34:05.962 --> 01:34:07.443]  They hate us because they really know.
[01:34:07.443 --> 01:34:08.323]  They tap our phones.
[01:34:08.323 --> 01:34:09.384]  They know we're not racist.
[01:34:09.384 --> 01:34:11.125]  They know we really want to bring people together.
[01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:13.306]  They know we're fans of humanity.
[01:34:13.306 --> 01:34:16.087]  And they know we're fearless because we realize we can't be slaves.
[01:34:16.087 --> 01:34:19.928]  We can't live on our knees because we'll get killed anyways.
[01:34:19.928 --> 01:34:21.869]  It's not live on your knees or die on your feet.
[01:34:21.869 --> 01:34:23.870]  It's live on your feet.
[01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:25.371]  Maybe die on your knees.
[01:34:27.256 --> 01:34:30.177]  Wish you'd die a thousand times, as they say, before you finally get it.
[01:34:30.177 --> 01:34:31.777]  Uh-uh.
[01:34:31.777 --> 01:34:35.258]  When I get concerned about something, I go on the attack.
[01:34:35.258 --> 01:34:39.159]  And listeners need to follow us on Real Alex Jones.
[01:34:39.159 --> 01:34:40.720]  They need to like us on the Facebook channels.
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:43.020]  You need to spread our videos, our articles.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.561]  They block us auto-sharing stuff to people.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:35:11.446]  But they can't stop you from sharing videos, and sharing articles, and getting them out to people, and sharing InfoWars.com forward slash show, and telling folks about local stations we're on, or telling stations, thank you for carrying the show, and tithing, not to some big corrupt church, but to a little church that tells the truth, or to the local radio station, or sign up for auto shipping at the products at InfoWarsStore.com, because we're in the eye of the storm here.
[01:35:12.645 --> 01:35:32.154]  And we're trying to stay in the eye where it's calm with all this around us and to be as peaceful as doves and wise as serpents, as Moses said, and trying to really do the right thing, trying to be honorable, trying to always tell the truth, trying to really take action and not squander the position we're in.
[01:35:32.154 --> 01:35:34.075]  So when I say the enemy has chosen me,
[01:35:35.243 --> 01:35:46.900]  As a champion, it's like in the old days when two kingdoms were about to fight, a lot of times they'd send the king's son or somebody else as their champion to fight the other person's champion.
[01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:52.940]  So that they didn't have to go to battle and destroy each other with irreconcilable differences.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:36:04.326]  And so, the globalists have chosen Trump, because he is our champion, and they also want to destroy any of the people that are carrying his sword for him and giving it to him when he gets on his horse.
[01:36:04.326 --> 01:36:12.410]  Anybody that dares support him, like a Jack Posobiec, or a Roger Stone, or a Mike Cernovich, or a Matt Drudge, they're going after all of his supporters.
[01:36:13.812 --> 01:36:22.399]  So no, when you support local affiliates that carry us, when you support this broadcast, you're supporting the people that are supporting this suicide mission.
[01:36:22.399 --> 01:36:26.463]  And a suicide mission doesn't mean you always die on it, but it means there's a 50-50 chance.
[01:36:26.463 --> 01:36:29.926]  I mean, this is a mission where you're 50-50, you're gonna die.
[01:36:30.546 --> 01:36:41.039]  But listen, the real suicide mission is going along with the New World Order, so go to Infowarsstore.com, get the coffee, get the videos, get the books, get the Patriot t-shirts to meet like-minded people.
[01:36:41.039 --> 01:36:44.163]  Get the CNN is fake news on the front, Infowars.com on the back.
[01:36:44.163 --> 01:36:45.485]  Wear it, meet like-minded people.
[01:36:46.085 --> 01:36:47.706]  If you work in the leftist area, they may kill you.
[01:36:47.706 --> 01:36:49.528]  But in general areas, you get dinner bought for you.
[01:36:49.528 --> 01:36:51.589]  The key is, now is the time to exercise free speech.
[01:36:51.589 --> 01:36:53.930]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:55.311]  Limited time special.
[01:36:55.311 --> 01:36:57.033]  Super Mel Vitality.
[01:36:57.033 --> 01:36:57.273]  57% off.
[01:36:57.273 --> 01:36:58.554]  Never done that before.
[01:36:58.554 --> 01:36:59.374]  It is amazing.
[01:36:59.374 --> 01:37:00.875]  Great way for you to try it.
[01:37:00.875 --> 01:37:04.558]  Super Combo with the BioTrue Organic Mustard Seed Selenium.
[01:37:04.558 --> 01:37:05.418]  You'll die without it.
[01:37:05.418 --> 01:37:06.579]  It's electrochemical.
[01:37:06.579 --> 01:37:08.841]  Media goes, she says you'll die without buying this product.
[01:37:08.841 --> 01:37:09.281]  No.
[01:37:09.281 --> 01:37:10.962]  You die without selenium.
[01:37:10.962 --> 01:37:12.063]  You die without oxygen.
[01:37:12.063 --> 01:37:13.023]  You die without water.
[01:37:13.023 --> 01:37:14.825]  You die without vitamin C. You die without iodine.
[01:37:15.325 --> 01:37:21.547]  Just type in government studies on iodine deficiency and brain damage and low IQs and cancer and all of it.
[01:37:21.547 --> 01:37:24.128]  Just look!
[01:37:24.128 --> 01:37:25.788]  Those are together 45% off.
[01:37:25.788 --> 01:37:26.908]  Those are the new big specials.
[01:37:26.908 --> 01:37:27.949]  Sign up for auto ship.
[01:37:27.949 --> 01:37:29.429]  Get 10% off.
[01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:30.149]  Free shipping.
[01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:31.690]  That's free shipping on order.
[01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:32.350]  $50 or more.
[01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:34.511]  Whatever you do, just commit to pray for us.
[01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:35.951]  Commit to spread the links.
[01:37:35.951 --> 01:37:37.411]  Commit to buy the products if you can.
[01:37:37.411 --> 01:37:38.792]  If you can't, I totally understand.
[01:37:40.196 --> 01:37:44.339]  But you should try to find the next best thing is some of the Himalayan salts and sea salts.
[01:37:44.339 --> 01:37:46.040]  You have to research them.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.140]  Have some good eye on them.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.841]  And so that's an expensive way to get it.
[01:37:48.841 --> 01:37:52.904]  But again, support us.
[01:37:52.904 --> 01:37:54.025]  We support you.
[01:37:54.025 --> 01:37:55.265]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:37:55.265 --> 01:37:55.786]  Get to understand.
[01:37:56.792 --> 01:37:58.474]  I'm mad at myself that I don't have enough energy.
[01:37:58.474 --> 01:38:01.776]  It'll be 10 o'clock at night and I'm calling people saying, we're going back into the office.
[01:38:01.776 --> 01:38:02.717]  I got to do this report.
[01:38:02.717 --> 01:38:04.899]  And it's because I know this is life and death.
[01:38:04.899 --> 01:38:05.560]  I'm in a fight.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.961]  I can't let these people win.
[01:38:06.961 --> 01:38:10.744]  We're bringing in Leanne McAdoo riding shotgun with myself and Posobiec.
[01:38:10.744 --> 01:38:14.207]  I didn't intend this to happen today with the two together, but it's kind of a nice mix.
[01:38:14.207 --> 01:38:18.471]  We'll get her take on this whole situation, what's happening worldwide.
[01:38:18.471 --> 01:38:21.534]  But Jack Posobiec, you were trying to get to some points right as we went to break.
[01:38:21.974 --> 01:38:26.076]  Dealing with how high the stakes are, what the next move is, what the next attack is.
[01:38:26.076 --> 01:38:28.217]  They're everywhere saying they're getting ready to kill him.
[01:38:28.217 --> 01:38:29.698]  They're saying he's mentally ill.
[01:38:29.698 --> 01:38:37.462]  They're saying this new commission with Pelosi and all them totally doddering to run a commission about how he's got Alzheimer's.
[01:38:37.462 --> 01:38:48.588]  I know they're trying to look confident to their own people to make people desert Trump by the threats of violence, both public and private, with the entire MSM calling for violence against Trump supporters.
[01:38:48.588 --> 01:38:49.309]  The question is,
[01:38:50.009 --> 01:38:51.771]  Have I judged America right?
[01:38:51.771 --> 01:38:55.575]  Does America take this as an insult and is now digging in their heels to be stronger?
[01:38:55.575 --> 01:38:57.878]  Or are we really a nation of cowards?
[01:38:57.878 --> 01:38:58.919]  And that's what this has come down to.
[01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:00.681]  This is about the test of who we are.
[01:39:00.681 --> 01:39:04.746]  I've had a lot of people around me who this has gotten so intense they just say, I can't handle it.
[01:39:04.926 --> 01:39:11.692]  And I understand that, but they're not going to be able to handle what comes after it if this city falls, if this republic goes down.
[01:39:11.692 --> 01:39:25.084]  True haters of us are going to have an absolute time of wanton rapine, but it'll also descend into a true civil war, and doesn't the enemy realize that they have stuck their mouth in the head of the lion?
[01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:35.521]  Yeah Alex, let me explain this commission to you because the 25th Amendment, they need the Vice President to go along with that.
[01:39:36.172 --> 01:39:38.794]  To declare the President unfit for office.
[01:39:38.794 --> 01:39:44.499]  They would need Pence to vote against the President's mental capacity for office.
[01:39:44.499 --> 01:39:46.440]  Mike Pence is not going to do that.
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:54.646]  So that is why the Democrats under Representative Democrat out of Portland, Representative Earl Blumenauer, they've introduced this new Oversight Commission.
[01:39:54.646 --> 01:39:58.489]  They're calling it the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity.
[01:39:58.489 --> 01:40:05.215]  It's a new act that they're trying to do as well concurrently with set up this commission to get this act passed.
[01:40:05.755 --> 01:40:14.165]  So it's another witch hunt group of a high priesthood to sit around and say, oh he's mentally ill with Pelosi not knowing what her name is as the chairman.
[01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:17.530]  Pelosi doesn't know what her name is.
[01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:20.992]  Maxine Waters doesn't even know what's going on in international affairs.
[01:40:20.992 --> 01:40:23.113]  She thinks Aleppo is on the wrong continent.
[01:40:23.113 --> 01:40:26.134]  She thinks Putin has been in office in North Korea.
[01:40:26.134 --> 01:40:27.375]  She's all over the place.
[01:40:27.375 --> 01:40:29.336]  But they're going to talk about this mental capacity.
[01:40:29.336 --> 01:40:35.719]  Meanwhile, if you look at a lot of these leaders, especially on the Democrat side, we've got octogenarians in charge of the party.
[01:40:35.719 --> 01:40:39.021]  In some cases, on the Republican Senate side, John McCain, of course.
[01:40:40.001 --> 01:40:45.087]  Heart goes out to the guy, praying for him, hoping he's healthy, but obviously has had some health issues.
[01:40:45.087 --> 01:40:49.112]  I actually broke the news about John McCain's health issues before he came public with it.
[01:40:49.112 --> 01:40:51.234]  That's right, you broke the brain tumor too.
[01:40:51.234 --> 01:40:53.878]  You broke the brain tumor, you broke it all, that's why you're fake news.
[01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:59.386]  Yeah, so I'm fake news because I've got sources within these offices.
[01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:00.166]  I've got sources.
[01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:02.447]  My eyes and ears are all over Capitol Hill.
[01:41:02.447 --> 01:41:04.007]  They're over the White House.
[01:41:04.007 --> 01:41:07.448]  I put that story out when they said John McCain was just getting eye surgery.
[01:41:07.448 --> 01:41:11.269]  I said, no, he actually has serious health issues.
[01:41:11.269 --> 01:41:13.289]  I've been told it has to do with his brain.
[01:41:13.289 --> 01:41:15.670]  It then came out later they had the brain tumor.
[01:41:15.670 --> 01:41:16.970]  So this is exactly what came out.
[01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:18.251]  They were trying to cover it up.
[01:41:18.251 --> 01:41:19.891]  But then when he had that sort of
[01:41:20.677 --> 01:41:21.177]  I don't think so.
[01:41:43.243 --> 01:41:44.724]  Russian influence in the campaign.
[01:41:44.724 --> 01:41:46.425]  Let's talk about foreign influence.
[01:41:46.425 --> 01:41:49.847]  Let's talk about where money's coming into the Democrat and Republican parties.
[01:41:49.847 --> 01:41:52.368]  Let's talk about these think tanks that are getting money.
[01:41:52.368 --> 01:41:56.631]  Let's talk about Mexican oligarchs like Carlos Slim owning the New York Times.
[01:41:56.631 --> 01:41:58.452]  You have to take, Alex, their
[01:41:59.245 --> 01:42:09.493]  Um, their targets, their types of attacks on us, and you flip it around, because they accuse us of doing the things that they themselves are doing, and that's exactly what it is in this case.
[01:42:09.493 --> 01:42:10.153]  Exactly.
[01:42:10.153 --> 01:42:16.257]  Let's bring in Leanne McAdoo, Infowars.com, amazing reporter, uh, to get her overall view.
[01:42:16.257 --> 01:42:19.980]  We haven't even talked yet, we're always synced up on the topics she wants to get into and I want to get into.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:27.646]  What do you make of this period we're in, the craziness, uh, just the, the, the over-the-top hate of the left now?
[01:42:28.447 --> 01:42:31.959]  That is just frothing insanity calling solar eclipse racist?
[01:42:31.959 --> 01:42:33.403]  Where is this going to go Leanne?
[01:42:33.403 --> 01:42:35.109]  What would you call this period we're in right now?
[01:42:36.224 --> 01:42:43.085]  Oh, these are dark days, but you know what, I think that we're kind of on the precipice, we're the light, we're just now kind of emerging.
[01:42:43.085 --> 01:43:03.329]  So many people like yourself, myself, Jack Posobiec, who are being called, you know, traitors or Nazis or we have mental instability, when it's clear and it's becoming clearer by the day that the people who are making those accusations are the ones with some serious mental issues that they've been trying to
[01:43:04.049 --> 01:43:04.770]  We're good to go.
[01:43:19.529 --> 01:43:34.759]  Now, you remember the Young Turks, they were huge Bernie Sanders supporters and once all that came out that the DNC was throwing the election, the nomination for Hillary Clinton, he vowed to go after the Democratic Party when Hillary lost.
[01:43:34.759 --> 01:43:43.705]  Well, now NewsBud is actually exposing that the Young Turks were paid $20 million by the Clinton train.
[01:43:44.901 --> 01:43:50.486]  To break that promise and to speak, you know, positively about Hillary Clinton and to actually not go after them.
[01:43:50.486 --> 01:43:52.168]  So that's incredible.
[01:43:52.168 --> 01:43:52.989]  Who can you trust?
[01:43:52.989 --> 01:44:04.560]  The people think that the Young Turks are this, you know, alternative site they can go to for truthful news when they're actually being paid by the very people they've promised their audience that they're going to go after.
[01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:08.243]  They're actually setting up this... Well, Leanne, I didn't know about this.
[01:44:08.243 --> 01:44:13.547]  I knew they got money from Qatar, more than $20 million, and from the monster Al Gore.
[01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:20.091]  And then I know that they were demonizing Hillary properly, and then they flipped and suddenly said, basically, you know, we love Hillary now.
[01:44:20.091 --> 01:44:21.713]  So that's really a great point.
[01:44:22.273 --> 01:44:25.534]  And so let's put up this article, I guess it's from Newsmax, has it?
[01:44:25.534 --> 01:44:30.656]  And Sybil Edmonds, former NSA, FBI translator, everything she documented ended up coming out.
[01:44:30.656 --> 01:44:33.777]  That's Newsbud, where media integrity matters.
[01:44:33.777 --> 01:44:35.598]  And I like her, because I call her a classical liberal.
[01:44:35.598 --> 01:44:39.019]  She's more of a liberal lady, but she exposes the left and the right.
[01:44:39.019 --> 01:44:41.380]  Clinton trained, paid the young Turks $20 million.
[01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:42.200]  Tell us about this, Leanne.
[01:44:43.743 --> 01:44:49.847]  Right, well, you know, you have to be a subscriber to NewsBud to get the entire story there, and I highly recommend it.
[01:44:49.847 --> 01:45:06.717]  They do great reporting there, but they follow the money, which is, you know, what you do as an investigative journalist, and they found out that, of course, the preferred method for sort of silencing your opposition or getting people to align with you, as far as the Clintons are concerned, is you can just pay them off.
[01:45:07.377 --> 01:45:17.947]  And what I think is really frustrating is that the Young Turks, they created this whole movement to try to get young progressive Democrats elected in 2018.
[01:45:17.947 --> 01:45:22.350]  So this is something that people really need to be looking out for on their local election.
[01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:23.912]  That's why we keep telling people to go.
[01:45:24.512 --> 01:45:43.855]  Be involved in your local election, run for office yourself if you can, because we do have these young progressive people on the Democratic side being trained by this group, this program the Young Turks have started to get into office, but they started it and told their audience that they're doing this because they were so
[01:45:44.855 --> 01:45:51.679]  Upset that the DNC threw it for Hillary Clinton and they were just going to, you know, rally the support of the Bernie supporters.
[01:45:51.679 --> 01:45:52.359]  I knew about that.
[01:45:52.359 --> 01:45:57.142]  It was really all the establishment calling it grassroots, but it was actually going to be the Democratic operatives.
[01:45:57.142 --> 01:46:01.825]  No one is more arrogant and greasy than Sink Turd or whatever his name is.
[01:46:01.825 --> 01:46:06.547]  And then they use the name Young Turks as the group that exterminated all the Armenians and other people.
[01:46:06.547 --> 01:46:07.608]  And they know.
[01:46:07.608 --> 01:46:11.370]  Then he says the Armenian genocide didn't happen because he's proud of the murder of the Christians.
[01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:12.491]  Clearly!
[01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:26.823]  I mean, using the name Young Turks, that's the brown shirts that brought those parties to power and launched the persecution in World War I with the Germans of over a million Armenians that they killed deader than a hammer.
[01:46:26.823 --> 01:46:33.949]  The only Christian groups that held on since the Islamic takeover of Constantinople and the rest of Turkey hundreds and hundreds of years ago.
[01:46:33.949 --> 01:46:39.353]  I mean, it's just like a guy called the Young Turks, like saying the Young Muslim Nazis
[01:46:40.174 --> 01:46:56.363]  And we love to kill Christians, and he's up there, literally, just this greasy, hateful, pig-like monster who sits around, you know, he attacked me the other day for chasing down some guy cussing at me and just saying, hey, give me an interview, going, you know, we don't need to cover him, he's so illegitimate, no one follows him.
[01:46:56.363 --> 01:46:59.164]  Dude, our website's like 5,000 times bigger than yours.
[01:46:59.164 --> 01:47:00.505]  We're all over the country.
[01:47:00.505 --> 01:47:02.046]  We advise, you name it.
[01:47:02.046 --> 01:47:05.167]  They're asking, the media was asking me today, well, where does Trump get your info?
[01:47:06.508 --> 01:47:08.670]  The CIA gives it to him.
[01:47:08.670 --> 01:47:11.732]  It isn't like all these agencies are against Trump.
[01:47:11.732 --> 01:47:16.676]  Trump goes and meets with the Patriots, he's got the Pentagon, top generals, all these people.
[01:47:16.676 --> 01:47:21.119]  Look, and a lot of this, again, people, it's all going to come out in the wash when we beat these people.
[01:47:21.119 --> 01:47:27.584]  It's just, understand folks, it's not just the squeaking, squawking people on TV saying we're going to kill Trump from the CIA and they're doing this.
[01:47:27.584 --> 01:47:28.925]  They're doing that because they're so weak.
[01:47:29.485 --> 01:47:36.372]  And they better hope and pray their operation isn't successful, because if they launch it, it's going to be a giant bear trap on their heads.
[01:47:36.372 --> 01:47:40.757]  Don't think Trump's just sitting there, waiting for them to try to kill him, and something isn't going to happen.
[01:47:40.757 --> 01:47:44.902]  I'm telling you, we are in a time where things are so incredible, Leanne.
[01:47:45.854 --> 01:47:58.362]  Right, and it's basically controlled opposition because you have all of these young Bernie Sanders supporters thinking that they're going to be rallying to this alternative media outlet, the Young Turks, when really they're just controlled opposition.
[01:47:58.362 --> 01:48:02.285]  They're being paid by the very people that they say they're going to be fighting against.
[01:48:02.845 --> 01:48:05.026]  And they're asking all their supporters for money in this.
[01:48:05.026 --> 01:48:09.087]  I mean, they're bragging about the fact that we would love George Soros' money.
[01:48:09.087 --> 01:48:10.107]  He's not funding us.
[01:48:10.107 --> 01:48:12.428]  We welcome it if he wants to fund us.
[01:48:12.428 --> 01:48:17.170]  You know, so they at a certain point, yes, back in the day, I think they did some great work.
[01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:19.790]  But now we've really seen them spiral down.
[01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:27.373]  And it's it's a shame to just where are people going to get their their news and information from if Google and these other
[01:48:28.653 --> 01:48:32.675]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:48:32.675 --> 01:48:33.395]  Let's expand on that.
[01:48:33.395 --> 01:48:39.778]  They're force-feeding, when I checked something about this with you, Leigh-Anne, they are force-feeding Young Turks through Google.
[01:48:39.778 --> 01:48:40.638]  They're partnering with them.
[01:48:40.638 --> 01:48:41.799]  It's true.
[01:48:41.799 --> 01:48:44.200]  We do videos in Live Time showing them attacking us.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:45.420]  It was down in minutes.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:49.602]  They were controlling our site and flipping us off with the Google guys going, yeah, we're in control, F you.
[01:48:49.602 --> 01:48:52.683]  And I went outside and did a video about it, and then they had to put it back up.
[01:48:52.683 --> 01:48:53.984]  I mean, that's how arrogant
[01:48:54.344 --> 01:48:54.805]  They are.
[01:48:54.805 --> 01:49:03.292]  It must be a power trip with Google to be able to get in and shut us down whenever you want so they can say that I attacked them when it was really the opposite, them spitting at me, trying to hit me.
[01:49:03.292 --> 01:49:05.994]  They invited me up and then set me up.
[01:49:05.994 --> 01:49:07.456]  One of the comedian guys invited me up.
[01:49:07.456 --> 01:49:08.216]  I guess he didn't know.
[01:49:08.216 --> 01:49:10.899]  Remember, Liam, we walked by first.
[01:49:10.899 --> 01:49:11.599]  I'll be back later.
[01:49:11.599 --> 01:49:12.460]  They were waving me over.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:14.502]  So later I just jump up as a surprise.
[01:49:14.502 --> 01:49:15.123]  It's all these little
[01:49:15.723 --> 01:49:21.168]  You know, shows throughout this parking garage that they air-conditioned, but that's the big thing.
[01:49:21.168 --> 01:49:34.702]  They're trying to silence us while they create all these straw man shows, launch a five day a week daily show program about me, where a guy plays a part of me but says things I never said about, I'm Alex Jones and I'm racist, you know, and they put out these lies so I get physically attacked.
[01:49:35.222 --> 01:49:37.646]  Passovic, let me ask you, and then Leanne, if we've got a break.
[01:49:37.646 --> 01:49:39.770]  How far will this go next?
[01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:46.102]  Because they're silencing us, or trying to, while they attack us everywhere, and then don't even let us respond.
[01:49:46.102 --> 01:49:48.325]  No journalistic integrity, no nothing.
[01:49:49.206 --> 01:49:53.989]  Because, Alex, what they're doing is they're taking comedy and they're weaponizing it, right?
[01:49:53.989 --> 01:50:05.457]  The Daily Show, these other organizations out there, they know that InfoWars is getting bigger, they know that it's penetrating through the memes, the songs, things are getting out into the mainstream.
[01:50:05.457 --> 01:50:08.579]  The name of InfoWars is getting out to the mainstream.
[01:50:08.579 --> 01:50:12.261]  Jack Pasovic, Leanne McAdoo, Alex Jones, we're becoming household names, believe it or not.
[01:50:12.541 --> 01:50:16.723]  So they've got to fight the framework battle by saying, don't listen to those guys.
[01:50:16.723 --> 01:50:17.903]  Those guys are crazy.
[01:50:17.903 --> 01:50:18.744]  Don't listen to those guys.
[01:50:18.744 --> 01:50:19.584]  Those guys are liars.
[01:50:19.584 --> 01:50:20.804]  You know, I watched that clip, Alex.
[01:50:20.804 --> 01:50:25.046]  They said, they said you put up lies behind you on the screen there in the studio.
[01:50:25.046 --> 01:50:27.027]  I see you out with the American flag behind you.
[01:50:27.027 --> 01:50:28.127]  Is the American flag a lie?
[01:50:28.127 --> 01:50:41.613]  According to these people, they will do anything they can to discredit us, to call us names, to put us in a framework so people don't believe anything that we say, even when everything we say is echoed weeks later in the mainstream.
[01:50:42.093 --> 01:50:46.314]  Exactly, it's because we're so accurate we're hated, because we're studying... The globalists are arrogant.
[01:50:46.314 --> 01:50:55.377]  Their downfall is they write white papers, they've got to communicate to their hundreds of thousands of operatives, so that you can always get their actual blueprints, you know, like you'd get an owner's manual to a car.
[01:50:55.377 --> 01:50:58.318]  And they're telling me the car has this engine, and the car does this.
[01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.178]  I'm going, this isn't...
[01:50:59.798 --> 01:51:02.662]  You know, the blue F-150, 450 horsepower, you say.
[01:51:02.662 --> 01:51:04.364]  This is a Pinto with this engine.
[01:51:04.364 --> 01:51:06.327]  I've got the owner's manual.
[01:51:06.327 --> 01:51:07.308]  And they're like, no, no, no.
[01:51:07.308 --> 01:51:07.809]  Don't look.
[01:51:07.809 --> 01:51:08.690]  Don't look at him.
[01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:10.212]  And all I'm doing is I'm not smart.
[01:51:10.212 --> 01:51:11.173]  Here's the owner's manual.
[01:51:11.173 --> 01:51:12.375]  They're going to do this next.
[01:51:12.375 --> 01:51:15.639]  Then it happens next because we have the owner's manual.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:27.907]  And you're right, Jack, but that's partly correct, because part of what you're saying is true, but more so it's about intimidating people who don't understand being demonized by these criminals is good.
[01:51:27.907 --> 01:51:38.553]  It's telling everybody else, you stick your head up, we'll do what we've done to Ron Paul, and Rand Paul, and Matt Drudge, and Alex Jones, and Jack Posobiec, and Leanne McAdoo, and everybody else that stands up.
[01:51:38.553 --> 01:51:42.775]  We're going to come after you, we're going to lie about you, we're going to attack your family.
[01:51:44.056 --> 01:51:47.079]  Look, they're going to attack our families if we don't stand up.
[01:51:47.079 --> 01:51:48.661]  Aren't we tired of laying down?
[01:51:48.661 --> 01:51:54.487]  Let's politically stand up and say, I don't know how this is going to end, but you want to get in a fight?
[01:51:54.487 --> 01:51:56.809]  You want to swing some fists politically?
[01:51:56.809 --> 01:52:01.074]  Get ready, because in the words of Ben Graham, it's clobbering time.
[01:52:01.074 --> 01:52:01.854]  Jack?
[01:52:01.854 --> 01:52:02.155]  Leanne?
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:04.801]  I love Ben Grimm on that.
[01:52:04.801 --> 01:52:05.482]  That's it, Alex.
[01:52:05.482 --> 01:52:07.183]  We're going to come at them with truth.
[01:52:07.183 --> 01:52:10.286]  I just did a huge expose on Ana Navarro last night.
[01:52:10.286 --> 01:52:16.912]  I put out how this CNN hack that they put on saying she's a Republican, when she supported Democrat candidates for years.
[01:52:16.912 --> 01:52:21.175]  She's raised money for the corrupt, indicted Senator Bob Menendez.
[01:52:21.175 --> 01:52:26.660]  And her father, believe it or not, was a member of the Nicaraguan Contras that were funded by the CIA.
[01:52:26.660 --> 01:52:28.742]  And she's completely open about all this stuff.
[01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:30.643]  Completely open about it.
[01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:33.225]  So we're going to come at them, not with fake news.
[01:52:33.225 --> 01:52:36.146]  We're not going to come at them with spurious accusations.
[01:52:36.146 --> 01:52:37.247]  We're going to do our research.
[01:52:37.247 --> 01:52:39.208]  We're going to dig into FEC records.
[01:52:39.208 --> 01:52:43.991]  And we're actually going to use their own tools and tactics to expose them.
[01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:48.894]  And of course, Menendez, what's he been caught sticking his little cookie jar in?
[01:52:48.894 --> 01:52:54.077]  There were some, it's all pay for play, getting people visas that should never have had visas.
[01:52:54.077 --> 01:52:55.418]  But it's not just that.
[01:52:55.418 --> 01:52:56.839]  He's got that elite.
[01:52:56.839 --> 01:52:57.860]  He's got that elite taste.
[01:52:59.384 --> 01:53:01.805]  Yeah, and he's going down because they've got him cold.
[01:53:01.805 --> 01:53:02.926]  They've got him pretty cold.
[01:53:02.926 --> 01:53:06.467]  And actually, it came down to a tiff between him and Obama.
[01:53:06.467 --> 01:53:10.429]  And Obama actually threw him under the bus and said, you know what, Bob?
[01:53:10.429 --> 01:53:12.930]  You've gone so far that I can't even protect you.
[01:53:12.930 --> 01:53:13.330]  You're done.
[01:53:13.330 --> 01:53:14.271]  And he threw him to the wolves.
[01:53:15.287 --> 01:53:22.172]  Well, that's the thing is, what is it about psychopaths and wimps that think they're going to start fights and push, push, push and not get pushback?
[01:53:22.172 --> 01:53:26.816]  And then when they finally get a big hard fist of truth upside their head, they're like, why did you do that?
[01:53:26.816 --> 01:53:31.700]  I'm like, you're attacking and hacking at us with hatchets and then we just kick you upside the head.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.701]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:53:34.022 --> 01:53:34.742]  And then they complain.
[01:53:34.742 --> 01:53:36.183]  They say, oh, they say we're coming.
[01:53:36.183 --> 01:53:37.703]  They say we're harassing them.
[01:53:37.703 --> 01:53:40.744]  They say that we're taking down them.
[01:53:40.744 --> 01:53:43.084]  I say, excuse me, look what you've done to my family.
[01:53:43.084 --> 01:53:44.224]  Look what you've said about me.
[01:53:44.224 --> 01:53:47.085]  Jake Tapper called me a freak yesterday on CNN.
[01:53:47.085 --> 01:53:50.326]  A freak, just freak, that the president retweeted.
[01:53:50.326 --> 01:53:51.666]  I said, Jake, come on.
[01:53:51.666 --> 01:53:52.586]  I'm a veteran.
[01:53:52.586 --> 01:53:53.967]  I've served our country.
[01:53:53.967 --> 01:53:55.447]  How many times have you served, Jake?
[01:53:55.447 --> 01:53:56.987]  So I said, I challenged him to a tap dance.
[01:53:56.987 --> 01:53:59.028]  Let's do a tap-off, me and Jake Tapper.
[01:53:59.028 --> 01:53:59.948]  I'll see you on the field.
[01:54:01.021 --> 01:54:07.366]  Leanne, my gut says we're going to have victory, but they're trying to ignite a real civil war, a race-based civil war.
[01:54:07.366 --> 01:54:08.146]  It's so sad.
[01:54:08.146 --> 01:54:13.330]  That's why we are trying to have unity and reach out to everybody and just say, let's come together and see through this scam.
[01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:18.073]  And then Trump's delivered on the economy the most base thing, something Obama promised he'd do.
[01:54:18.073 --> 01:54:20.135]  Trump did it already in seven months.
[01:54:22.028 --> 01:54:38.551]  Well, you know, Alex, what I think is really interesting is we have Nancy Pelosi coming out mixing the metaphors where she was wanting to say, you know, you can't shout fire in a crowded theater, but she said you can't yell wolf in a crowded theater because she was mixing the metaphor of crying wolf.
[01:54:38.551 --> 01:54:41.151]  And that's exactly what the left and the Democrats are doing.
[01:54:41.151 --> 01:54:47.032]  They're crying wolf, calling everyone a Nazi, everyone a white supremacist, and it's getting diluted.
[01:54:47.032 --> 01:54:49.793]  They're really trying to ramp this up, thinking it's going to work for them.
[01:54:50.213 --> 01:54:53.135]  That's right, but don't worry, she'll run the commission looking into Trump's brain.
[01:54:53.135 --> 01:54:55.517]  I mean, this is a total separation of powers violation.
[01:54:55.517 --> 01:54:58.580]  Let's play that big bad wolf clip here, because you never cry wolf in a theater.
[01:55:19.637 --> 01:55:25.442]  How could the Park Service justify denying that organization their free speech rights?
[01:55:25.442 --> 01:55:32.428]  Because the Constitution does not say that a person can shout, yell, wolf in a crowded theater.
[01:55:32.428 --> 01:55:38.734]  If you are endangering people, then you don't have a constitutional right to do that.
[01:55:38.734 --> 01:55:39.755]  There you go.
[01:55:39.755 --> 01:55:44.399]  So they want to put free controls on the First Amendment, which is no First Amendment at all, Leigh Ann Jack.
[01:55:45.598 --> 01:55:46.199]  Right.
[01:55:46.199 --> 01:55:52.650]  Well, and the thing is, is that she's coming out saying that this is going to be a white supremacist rally coming up in San Francisco and Berkeley.
[01:55:52.650 --> 01:55:54.433]  It's this Patriot Prayer Rally.
[01:55:54.433 --> 01:55:57.217]  It's being put on by someone who himself is a person of color.
[01:55:57.217 --> 01:55:59.862]  That's right, even like multi-racial Christians now are white supremacists.
[01:56:00.819 --> 01:56:01.619]  Right.
[01:56:01.619 --> 01:56:02.079]  Exactly.
[01:56:02.079 --> 01:56:05.140]  And it's getting, people are getting sick and tired of it.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:10.221]  But the thing I think is interesting is people in San Francisco don't even bother to look into it.
[01:56:10.221 --> 01:56:13.522]  They're just going to go and put their pets' poop.
[01:56:13.522 --> 01:56:14.562]  Oh yeah, I saw that!
[01:56:14.562 --> 01:56:22.944]  Under the Golden Gate Bridge, a thousand people, it's Associated Press, are going to show up and have their dogs' poop, so that everyone can like walk around and poop.
[01:56:22.944 --> 01:56:24.505]  And Antifa throws poop at people.
[01:56:24.505 --> 01:56:25.505]  Why are they so sick?
[01:56:27.711 --> 01:56:32.414]  Because Alex, these people have been sold a bill of programming.
[01:56:32.414 --> 01:56:43.321]  They've been programmed in institutions, they've been programmed by mainstream media, by television, by video games in some cases, that they need to hate.
[01:56:43.321 --> 01:56:44.282]  That they have violence.
[01:56:44.282 --> 01:56:45.143]  It's like they live.
[01:56:45.143 --> 01:56:47.984]  All the subtext behind popular culture that we see today.
[01:56:47.984 --> 01:56:48.665]  The violence.
[01:56:48.965 --> 01:56:50.706]  The guns that are out there.
[01:56:50.706 --> 01:56:54.689]  They're, you know, sort of making this stuff feel like this is what you should do, what you want to do.
[01:56:54.689 --> 01:56:59.533]  But then they're also saying, you can't do this, you can't do this, you can't be masculine, you have to control that, you have to put it down.
[01:56:59.533 --> 01:57:03.055]  And now they turn you loose and say, these are the enemies.
[01:57:03.055 --> 01:57:05.417]  These are the people that we need to target, these Christians.
[01:57:06.638 --> 01:57:13.903]  And then when I walk down the street and I throw coffee on me and scream Nazi and I try to, you know, hug a black guy and he thinks I'm a Nazi and runs off.
[01:57:13.903 --> 01:57:15.204]  Look right here, The Guardian.
[01:57:15.204 --> 01:57:16.245]  Turd Reich.
[01:57:16.245 --> 01:57:19.788]  San Francisco dog owners lay minefield of poo for a right-wing rally.
[01:57:19.788 --> 01:57:24.932]  Because I want to be sure if new listeners are tuning in on radio, this sounds insane.
[01:57:24.932 --> 01:57:27.293]  It sounds like we're making all this up.
[01:57:27.293 --> 01:57:31.276]  Like Antifa in a new article, in a new video, has pledged to kill police.
[01:57:32.496 --> 01:57:37.099]  Actually, what Nancy Pelosi said is correct, but she should have said it regarding Antifa.
[01:57:37.099 --> 01:57:38.160]  She should have said that's true.
[01:58:02.376 --> 01:58:06.658]  Destruction, chaos, assassination of police officers, assassination of the president.
[01:58:06.658 --> 01:58:08.038]  And they've been doing it!
[01:58:08.038 --> 01:58:09.359]  And they've been doing it!
[01:58:09.359 --> 01:58:10.740]  And they've been doing it!
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:18.363]  They think the police, when they nationwide kill a couple hundred a day, are gonna roll over and go, we'll do what you say, we'll be liberal, we'll let you run our review boards now.
[01:58:18.363 --> 01:58:19.003]  And you know what?
[01:58:19.003 --> 01:58:20.383]  I mean, the cops seem to follow orders.
[01:58:20.383 --> 01:58:20.844]  Maybe they will!
[01:58:21.804 --> 01:58:23.645]  And then the cops will become the enemy.
[01:58:23.645 --> 01:58:25.745]  He worked for a bunch of anti-cop killers.
[01:58:25.745 --> 01:58:27.226]  I just can't believe how far we've come.
[01:58:27.226 --> 01:58:30.507]  Let's do five more minutes, and then we've got major breaking news.
[01:58:30.507 --> 01:58:32.467]  He's never done this in ten years coming on.
[01:58:32.467 --> 01:58:34.648]  We have Doug Hagman coming on.
[01:58:34.648 --> 01:58:39.469]  He says exclusive intel on major plans for civil war.
[01:58:39.469 --> 01:58:43.431]  He's got his sources on the East Coast and the NYPD that exposed the pedophilia.
[01:58:43.431 --> 01:58:44.251]  We're going to all come back.
[01:58:44.251 --> 01:58:44.631]  Stay with us.
[01:58:46.102 --> 01:58:47.704]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion!

[02:00:23.462 --> 02:00:25.163]  A lot of other guests joining us coming up.
[02:00:25.163 --> 02:00:31.025]  Doug Hagman, Breaking News.
[02:00:31.025 --> 02:00:32.266]  What else is on your radar?
[02:00:32.266 --> 02:00:33.526]  What else is coming up?
[02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:36.868]  What else did you impart to the audience?
[02:00:36.868 --> 02:00:40.269]  Going forward, Alex, I want to see more and more
[02:00:41.127 --> 02:00:41.708]  I don't think so.
[02:00:56.545 --> 02:00:59.908]  How do we get information to the president?
[02:00:59.908 --> 02:01:05.293]  How do we make sure that we're using social media, that we're using other avenues of approach?
[02:01:05.293 --> 02:01:07.455]  Now, when I worked in intelligence, that's what you would do.
[02:01:07.455 --> 02:01:16.023]  If you had a source, if you had a target, you would try to say, what are the avenues of approach you could use to potentially get to that person, get to that object?
[02:01:16.323 --> 02:01:24.153]  That's what we're now looking at, different channels to get our news, to get your news Alex, our stories to the President so that he can make these decisions.
[02:01:24.153 --> 02:01:26.075]  We know that he's right and that's number one.
[02:01:26.075 --> 02:01:30.000]  Number two is, who is rising up to run against the President?
[02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:31.403]  In 2020.
[02:01:31.403 --> 02:01:35.565]  John Kasich, this is something I broke a few weeks ago that he was considering it.
[02:01:35.565 --> 02:01:40.707]  Now it's in Axios, now it's Politico that Kasich is trying to run potentially as an independent.
[02:01:40.707 --> 02:01:50.692]  And we noticed that nobody on the Democrat side seems to really be jumping up to say, I'm doing it, I'm filing nomination petitions against the president to run as a Democrat.
[02:01:50.692 --> 02:01:55.994]  So I'm very interested to see because Alex, there's no way they can run on anything they're doing right now.
[02:01:55.994 --> 02:01:57.915]  They are in total scorched earth
[02:01:57.995 --> 02:01:58.676]  We're good to go.
[02:02:11.769 --> 02:02:18.132]  But I don't know if I see her building out the nationwide infrastructure, having the donor meetings that she'd be required to have.
[02:02:18.132 --> 02:02:28.458]  So I'm keeping a very close eye on the DNC and the RNC, as always, Alex, to see what they're up to next to stop our president and to stop our movement.
[02:02:28.458 --> 02:02:31.119]  Jack Bosobik, everybody should follow you on Twitter and everywhere else.
[02:02:31.119 --> 02:02:33.020]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:34.281]  Thank you.
[02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:35.602]  Leanne, that's a good point he makes.
[02:02:38.407 --> 02:02:42.329]  The polls show people aren't into this Russia stuff, this race stuff.
[02:02:42.329 --> 02:02:44.129]  It's not working, but they just keep pushing it.
[02:02:44.129 --> 02:02:46.150]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:51.192]  Well Alex, everyone just needs to understand that this is Saul Alinsky rule for radicals.
[02:02:51.192 --> 02:02:57.555]  I mean, we have Gary Cohn coming out saying that Trump must do better to condemn neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
[02:02:57.555 --> 02:02:58.955]  What more can he do?
[02:02:58.955 --> 02:03:07.259]  This is the Saul Alinsky tactic of picking your target, freezing it, continuing to hit, never letting down, continually keeping your opposition.
[02:03:07.859 --> 02:03:13.281]  I'm having to defend themselves against these attacks that have zero basis in reality.
[02:03:13.281 --> 02:03:22.384]  But as long as Trump is being forced to continue condemning neo-Nazis, I mean, he's been, they've been forcing him to do this since, since before the election.
[02:03:22.384 --> 02:03:30.686]  And so as long as they can keep him, because that's all they have, then he can be distracted and, you know, tweet out things that the media can spin out of control.
[02:03:30.686 --> 02:03:36.848]  He's going to be distracted from completing his agenda, or he's going to allow these other neocons that are, have
[02:03:37.228 --> 02:03:37.368]  Yeah.
[02:03:57.683 --> 02:04:03.525]  This is Saul Alinsky, and this is what the left is using to target the president, to target his supporters.
[02:04:03.525 --> 02:04:07.006]  It doesn't matter how much he disavows or condemns, it's never going to be enough.
[02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:07.706]  They're never going to stop.
[02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.466]  It's a political tactic.
[02:04:08.466 --> 02:04:09.627]  They're never going to stop.
[02:04:09.627 --> 02:04:13.128]  Doesn't the left get they're being manipulated, that they're being controlled?
[02:04:13.128 --> 02:04:13.708]  It's pathetic.
[02:04:15.066 --> 02:04:16.586]  Right, they don't get it.
[02:04:16.586 --> 02:04:21.367]  They don't see that there's agent provocateurs, there's controlled opposition.
[02:04:21.367 --> 02:04:27.348]  They don't see that the person who's putting on the Patriot Prayer Rally is a person of color.
[02:04:27.348 --> 02:04:32.409]  On his Facebook page it says, no Nazis, no white supremacists allowed.
[02:04:32.409 --> 02:04:34.949]  But they're still calling it a white supremacist rally?
[02:04:34.949 --> 02:04:36.190]  It'll never be enough.
[02:04:36.190 --> 02:04:38.010]  That's right, Leanne McAdoo on Twitter.
[02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:40.670]  Leanne, thank you so much, InfoWars correspondent.
[02:04:40.670 --> 02:04:42.851]  There goes Leanne McAdoo, straight ahead.
[02:04:42.851 --> 02:04:44.431]  We've got breaking information.
[02:04:45.603 --> 02:04:46.944]  That is critical.
[02:04:46.944 --> 02:04:48.345]  This is exclusive information.
[02:04:48.345 --> 02:04:48.825]  Straight ahead.
[02:04:48.825 --> 02:04:52.548]  We'll be back in 4Wars.com.
[02:04:52.548 --> 02:04:56.310]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[02:04:56.310 --> 02:05:02.495]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[02:05:02.495 --> 02:05:11.441]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in ripple effect.
[02:05:11.661 --> 02:05:14.084]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[02:05:14.084 --> 02:05:17.927]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[02:05:17.927 --> 02:05:21.631]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[02:05:21.631 --> 02:05:25.035]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[02:05:25.035 --> 02:05:33.583]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[02:05:33.583 --> 02:05:35.065]  Such as global warming, for example.
[02:05:35.245 --> 02:05:44.428]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments to their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[02:05:44.428 --> 02:05:50.930]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:52.111]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:05:52.711 --> 02:05:57.413]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:05:57.413 --> 02:06:08.057]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had
[02:06:08.277 --> 02:06:08.437]  I think?
[02:06:26.556 --> 02:06:27.217]  We're good.

[02:08:05.014 --> 02:08:09.857]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:09.857 --> 02:08:11.538]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:08:11.538 --> 02:08:13.200]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:20.785]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.785 --> 02:08:29.531]  Well, Hurricane Harvey set to hit at about 7, 8 o'clock Central tonight into Texas, Category 3, 40 inches of rain, a true disaster.
[02:08:30.796 --> 02:08:51.172]  But the big disaster we've been witnessing the last three years plus has been CNN, MSNBC, the former White House run by Obama and his Justice Department openly saying police deserve to die because another officer in another jurisdiction might have done something wrong.
[02:08:51.172 --> 02:08:53.674]  The media would fan the flames of that.
[02:08:53.674 --> 02:08:56.016]  In most cases, it turned out to be a fraud.
[02:08:56.016 --> 02:08:58.798]  And then say, well, cops deserve to die.
[02:08:58.798 --> 02:08:59.279]  They're bad.
[02:09:00.592 --> 02:09:13.136]  We're going to give you exclusive information right now from Doug Hagman, who has broken big stories here, like the Wiener story and the texting, the sexting to minors.
[02:09:13.136 --> 02:09:24.199]  That was here first with Doug Hagman of the Hagman Report, syndicated radio broadcaster in his own right, law enforcement trainer, long-term private investigator working in New Jersey and New York.
[02:09:25.367 --> 02:09:27.730]  I've been listening to him 15 years, been interviewing him 10 years.
[02:09:27.730 --> 02:09:34.078]  He always gives us really on-spot info, and I've never gotten him to send me an emergency memo like this.
[02:09:34.078 --> 02:09:38.984]  InfoWars, Doug Hagman exclusive to InfoWars, not made public until now.
[02:09:40.336 --> 02:09:42.177]  Coordinating with law enforcement.
[02:09:42.177 --> 02:09:44.619]  Confirming with the intel.
[02:09:44.619 --> 02:09:49.062]  Not just the public statements and CNN and MSNBC saying attack Trump supporters.
[02:09:49.062 --> 02:09:50.343]  They're all Nazis.
[02:09:50.343 --> 02:09:51.824]  All Trump supporters are Nazis.
[02:09:51.824 --> 02:09:53.585]  All gun owners are Nazis.
[02:09:53.585 --> 02:09:55.567]  Telling the ACLU.
[02:09:55.567 --> 02:09:59.109]  Tweeting a photo of a white baby with American flag is racist.
[02:09:59.109 --> 02:10:00.730]  ACLU apologizing.
[02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:02.412]  Saying the Eclipse is racist.
[02:10:02.412 --> 02:10:09.717]  This is mass race war programming that Soros doubled the money after Trump won to Black Lives Matter, Antifa and others.
[02:10:11.058 --> 02:10:14.641]  And so we've got where they're planning the attacks, what's happening?
[02:10:14.641 --> 02:10:24.007]  They are openly saying this on the news, but law enforcement is tracking federal and state and has confirmed they're planning to target civilian members of the pro-Trump communities.
[02:10:24.007 --> 02:10:26.109]  That's why I was being attacked so hard in Seattle.
[02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:27.310]  The message is going out.
[02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:29.751]  Attack, kill, do what you can.
[02:10:29.751 --> 02:10:34.475]  Opposing groups, specifically free speech groups, ban free speech, attack all protests.
[02:10:34.475 --> 02:10:39.539]  Christian groups want to march, had marches set up months ago, say they're racist, go out, attack them.
[02:10:40.692 --> 02:10:43.476]  This sounds crazy, but just join us, it's mainstream news.
[02:10:43.476 --> 02:10:47.561]  Bring 10,000 dogs, have them all crap on the field where the Christians are coming.
[02:10:47.561 --> 02:10:51.005]  No Christians, no whites, no conservatives, no libertarians.
[02:10:51.005 --> 02:10:52.287]  That's how it works.
[02:10:52.287 --> 02:10:55.371]  Describe it, all opposition is alt-right, then say it's Nazi.
[02:10:56.670 --> 02:11:12.690]  So this is directly memos from law enforcement, and there's a lot more I haven't gotten into this yet, but this is very, very serious all over the United States, and they're preparing a violent revolution, as they said a month ago, they're getting ready in the next two months to overthrow Trump.
[02:11:12.690 --> 02:11:14.732]  Soros wanted the summer of rage, that came out.
[02:11:15.489 --> 02:11:23.439]  And you're gonna see CNN like it's normal, like when they back the Arab Spring overthrowing our ally in Egypt, saying they're blowing up churches, they're burning, they're killing tens of thousands.
[02:11:23.439 --> 02:11:24.480]  This is good.
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:25.822]  The Christians deserve it.
[02:11:25.822 --> 02:11:32.670]  You'll see Anderson Cooper right there saying, you know, Ron Paul's been killed, Matt Dredge's been killed, the President's been killed, this is loving, this is liberal.
[02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:34.292]  Kill, kill, kill.
[02:11:34.292 --> 02:11:34.973]  That's why they've got...
[02:11:35.433 --> 02:11:39.175]  Flower shops and coffee shops in the news saying, are you a racist?
[02:11:39.175 --> 02:11:40.956]  Do you pledge allegiance against Trump?
[02:11:40.956 --> 02:11:44.778]  They're identifying getting their people ready as little secret agents for this.
[02:11:44.778 --> 02:11:47.820]  So you want to see the globalist communist takeover.
[02:11:47.820 --> 02:11:48.680]  They're ready.
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.021]  They're planning it.
[02:11:50.021 --> 02:11:52.763]  And that's why they've been trying to intimidate law enforcement to get on board.
[02:11:52.763 --> 02:11:54.764]  So I'm going to give the floor because he's a.
[02:11:55.543 --> 02:11:58.807]  Polite and humble guy, and he'll wait for me to talk and I'll run over him.
[02:11:58.807 --> 02:12:05.076]  Doug Hagman to go through this intelligence memo, a lot of which I've got from my own sources, and the enemy's out in the open.
[02:12:05.076 --> 02:12:05.837]  This is big.
[02:12:05.837 --> 02:12:07.639]  He's got the timetable for us.
[02:12:07.639 --> 02:12:08.881]  Thank you so much, Doug Hagman.
[02:12:10.037 --> 02:12:20.201]  Alex, thanks so much for having me, and I really appreciate the war effort, what you're doing, and the changes that you're causing in this country.
[02:12:20.201 --> 02:12:23.162]  You're actually doing a lot for the cause.
[02:12:23.162 --> 02:12:26.403]  I just, as of 4.10 a.m.
[02:12:26.403 --> 02:12:38.287]  my time this morning, I heard from an investigator, one of my investigators actually, we've got, and this is, I have not really made this announcement official to this point,
[02:12:39.067 --> 02:12:52.350]  But over the past several months, actually since the election, we have gathered, I've managed to gather a handful of accredited licensed investigators all across the United States.
[02:12:52.350 --> 02:13:05.613]  Not many, but enough to make an impact, a difference, and to investigate and infiltrate various groups such as Indivisible, Antifa, and all of the... And you said that you were going to be going the Project Veritas model?
[02:13:06.875 --> 02:13:08.537]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:13:08.537 --> 02:13:19.510]  Now, one of the things that I heard from this morning, one of the investigators I heard from this morning attended a meeting last night in San Francisco.
[02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:22.814]  That's all I'm prepared to say in terms of location.
[02:13:22.814 --> 02:13:24.797]  You don't want to give up too much, identify him.
[02:13:25.137 --> 02:13:26.478]  Right, right.
[02:13:26.478 --> 02:13:30.302]  And this meeting, I'll just summarize it by saying this.
[02:13:30.302 --> 02:13:43.453]  The left, hard left, the progressive left, the communist left, the people that are organizing these marches, these riots, more appropriately, they are preparing for war.
[02:13:43.453 --> 02:13:45.115]  Civil war in this country.
[02:13:45.115 --> 02:13:52.041]  Their targets are civilians who openly support Donald Trump or for capitalism or free enterprise.
[02:13:52.821 --> 02:13:56.462]  Civilians who openly support free speech.
[02:13:56.462 --> 02:14:02.404]  Conservative Christians and conservatives and Christians separately and collectively.
[02:14:02.404 --> 02:14:12.228]  And of course they have a special division or a special aspect of this where they are being taught how to confront law enforcement personnel.
[02:14:12.888 --> 02:14:34.296]  So there's a three-tiered operational system taking place right now, training groups right now that are in progress all across the United States that are being funded by, under the umbrella of the Obama Organizing for Action and the Soros, the Woods Fund.
[02:14:34.296 --> 02:14:35.917]  I'm saying this now, these are my words.
[02:14:36.757 --> 02:14:49.423]  As best I can tell, the non-profits, the larger NGOs that operate under the umbrella of either OFA, Organizing for Action, or the Soros group of NGOs.
[02:14:49.423 --> 02:14:55.186]  And they're funding these training sessions all across the United States.
[02:14:55.186 --> 02:14:58.688]  Offshoots of the 250 satellite branches of OFA, Organizing for Action, and parcel to the 32,500 plus
[02:15:06.411 --> 02:15:08.792]  Foot soldiers of Organizing for Action.
[02:15:08.792 --> 02:15:11.732]  They're working in tandem with one another.
[02:15:11.732 --> 02:15:33.958]  We have groups, and we're able to verify this, we have groups such as Indivisible, Antifa, Black Lives Matter, By Any Means Necessary, and a few new ones that have sprung up, including one that just sprung up here four days ago, actually, the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement, which is, they just opened a Philadelphia chapter.
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:46.511]  All that are connected to this resist narrative, resist fascism narrative.
[02:15:46.511 --> 02:15:50.877]  And this is all cloaked under the guise, under the pretext of we're gonna fight
[02:15:51.622 --> 02:15:54.243]  For freedom in this country.
[02:15:54.243 --> 02:15:59.764]  We're going to fight the tyranny, the fascism that the Trump administration is bringing into America.
[02:15:59.764 --> 02:16:04.305]  We're going to bring back the Obama model and system of governance.
[02:16:04.305 --> 02:16:15.448]  And we're also going to use both academia as well as, and this is important, Obama holdovers within our government, still there, including and especially within the Department of Justice.
[02:16:16.792 --> 02:16:28.878]  That's a two-pronged approach to, number one, be notified of any type of advanced police action, and second of all, to circumvent prosecution, or to assist in circumventing prosecution.
[02:16:28.878 --> 02:16:34.421]  And to stand down, like in Charlottesville, when they attack Christian groups or anybody else.
[02:16:34.421 --> 02:16:35.261]  Exactly.
[02:16:35.261 --> 02:16:42.445]  So, the report I got this morning, early this morning, from the investigator in the West Coast said this.
[02:16:43.368 --> 02:16:58.939]  You basically won't believe the group in San Francisco, in the San Francisco area, was not in San Francisco, but in that area, men basically that looked nothing like he had ever suspected.
[02:16:58.939 --> 02:17:03.122]  I mean, people dressed in, nicely dressed, in dress jeans and khakis.
[02:17:03.122 --> 02:17:06.384]  Yeah, we're not just fighting the little dirty meth heads now.
[02:17:06.384 --> 02:17:08.626]  They freaked out enough people now and had enough
[02:17:09.446 --> 02:17:14.869]  Public figures with authority on mainstream news and Congress say this that they're in a war.
[02:17:14.869 --> 02:17:15.590]  We're gonna fight.
[02:17:15.590 --> 02:17:30.678]  We've got Maxine water saying it's a war I'm coming for you, and she's out of that area I'm coming for you Trump, and you've got former CIA deputy director saying we're going to kill Trump soon So a lot of these are gonna end up being intelligence operatives as you just said from deep state.
[02:17:30.678 --> 02:17:33.800]  They are preparing their move This is it ladies and gentlemen
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:38.662]  Yeah, and you've been ahead of the curve on this, and I have to give you a lot of credit.
[02:17:38.662 --> 02:17:39.502]  Well, enough about me, my friend.
[02:17:39.502 --> 02:17:42.323]  We now know they're in the news saying they're getting ready to go operational.
[02:17:42.323 --> 02:17:44.284]  So continue with your report.
[02:17:44.284 --> 02:17:55.468]  So, okay, one of the things, okay, when my investigator went in first, the thing that really surprised him, first of all, the location of the meeting was
[02:17:56.498 --> 02:18:00.582]  I'm not going to say done in code, but it was done very snarkily.
[02:18:00.582 --> 02:18:01.783]  Cryptically.
[02:18:01.783 --> 02:18:02.504]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:18:02.504 --> 02:18:03.545]  Thank you.
[02:18:03.545 --> 02:18:10.511]  And anyway, when he arrived at this meeting location... Which shows they know they're getting watched.
[02:18:11.483 --> 02:18:14.047]  Absolutely, and that's a good point.
[02:18:14.047 --> 02:18:24.239]  And when he arrived at the meeting location, there was an initial invitation and then upon his arrival he was actually searched and they took away all electronics.
[02:18:24.239 --> 02:18:26.922]  There was no allowance for iPads or iPhones.
[02:18:26.922 --> 02:18:28.645]  This shows amazing criminal intent.
[02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:30.894]  Absolutely.
[02:18:30.894 --> 02:18:38.337]  And they actually put the phones in a separate room and made sure that they were off, very interestingly.
[02:18:38.337 --> 02:18:45.679]  And they all but searched, I mean frisked, like a law enforcement officer would, the attendees to this meeting.
[02:18:45.679 --> 02:18:48.620]  So, this shows... Organized.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.800]  Absolutely organized.
[02:18:50.460 --> 02:19:05.764]  Now one of the things that they're modeling this and it's this surprised me 20 or 47 years ago yesterday there was a bombing at the University of Wisconsin in Madison At 342 a.m.
[02:19:05.764 --> 02:19:12.706]  The target was the Army Mathematics Research Center and again 47 that this is April or August 24th 1970 and
[02:19:14.941 --> 02:19:22.426]  A 2,000 pound ammonium nitrate fertilizer oil bomb went off.
[02:19:22.426 --> 02:19:24.788]  You're saying this is Weatherman 2.0?
[02:19:24.788 --> 02:19:25.749]  Basically, yeah.
[02:19:25.749 --> 02:19:26.349]  Yeah.
[02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:35.075]  And they're studying the tactics and the operational methods from history, from long ago, from a decade ago.
[02:19:35.075 --> 02:19:35.736]  Doug, stay there.
[02:19:35.736 --> 02:19:37.717]  Everything you're saying is hell.
[02:19:37.717 --> 02:19:39.178]  I know you've got your sources of people infiltrating.
[02:19:39.178 --> 02:19:39.719]  This is huge.
[02:19:39.719 --> 02:19:41.880]  But they're out in the open saying violence is good.
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:42.581]  Overthrow.
[02:19:42.581 --> 02:19:43.261]  Kill everybody.
[02:19:45.342 --> 02:19:51.767]  I just... I just hope somehow we move against them before they do.
[02:19:51.767 --> 02:19:54.329]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?

[02:22:57.717 --> 02:22:59.298]  But the symptoms are there.

[02:24:28.236 --> 02:24:30.758]  Now if you'll buy that,
[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:36.856]  I got some oceanfront property in action.
[02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:42.231]  You know what's scary about these reports from around the country?
[02:24:42.231 --> 02:24:44.712]  The clean-cut professionals they've got.
[02:24:44.712 --> 02:24:48.273]  But you know those people aren't clean-cut professionals.
[02:24:48.273 --> 02:24:49.614]  It's operatives.
[02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:50.835]  Corporate, governmental.
[02:24:50.835 --> 02:24:52.915]  They've been waiting so long for this.
[02:24:52.915 --> 02:24:56.757]  They were planning to launch this once Hillary got in with a race war they were going to start.
[02:24:56.757 --> 02:24:59.138]  But now we've got a beachhead to direct against them.
[02:24:59.138 --> 02:25:00.218]  We've got them caught.
[02:25:00.218 --> 02:25:01.759]  They're in the pincer attack.
[02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:02.839]  That's why they're so desperate.
[02:25:02.839 --> 02:25:06.461]  And they're led at the top.
[02:25:07.785 --> 02:25:10.647]  By a bunch of scum.
[02:25:10.647 --> 02:25:15.009]  Harvey is slamming into Texas, 110 miles an hour, 35 inches of rain to 40.
[02:25:15.009 --> 02:25:18.991]  Expected hits around 7 o'clock tonight, but it's already starting to hit.
[02:25:18.991 --> 02:25:25.235]  We'll have live coverage tonight, Infowars.com, with our news team and reporters on the ground.
[02:25:25.235 --> 02:25:33.019]  But the big storm hitting, as bad as this will be for Texas and the undoubted deaths, the 35 to 40 inches of rain that are going to hit Houston and other areas,
[02:25:34.073 --> 02:25:57.682]  That city floods at three inches in one day, is that they're on the news saying, we're getting ready for violence, we're going to kill Trump supporters, we're going to attack his family, the lawsuits, the harassment, none of it's worked, the demonization, where they're on the news saying KKK, racists are everywhere, horrible slander, racial attacks on whites are exploding, stabbing, shootings, I mean it is insane, but most people still see through it.
[02:25:58.479 --> 02:26:12.898]  And the Doug Hagman has worked with a bunch of law enforcement and private investigators, that way you can have the go-between, because law enforcement can't give you info officially, but the investigators is the go-between, going to these meetings and they're planning something big, something violent, and targeting people.
[02:26:13.599 --> 02:26:16.642]  So, I know you get into what your sources are saying.
[02:26:16.642 --> 02:26:20.225]  Everybody should really start packing, know what you're doing, and being prepared.
[02:26:20.225 --> 02:26:24.809]  But more importantly, information warfare-wise, we have to get out ahead of this.
[02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:29.393]  Because notice, when they call for violence on their own channels that are departmentalized,
[02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:35.698]  Then we cover it, they go, Jones is insane, or Doug Hagman's insane, or Matt Drudge is insane, or Daily Caller's insane.
[02:26:35.698 --> 02:26:42.404]  There's no plan for violence when they're all over CNN, MSNBC, so many clips every day, I can't even, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:26:42.404 --> 02:26:46.727]  People killing city council members, judges, Republicans, being shot everywhere.
[02:26:46.727 --> 02:26:48.288]  They're like, nothing's happening, nothing's happening.
[02:26:48.288 --> 02:26:53.393]  While they agitate their mass, they're telling us we're not attacking, this isn't a war.
[02:26:53.393 --> 02:26:54.874]  So classic military tactics.
[02:26:54.874 --> 02:26:57.356]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, but Doug,
[02:26:57.916 --> 02:26:58.618]  Other intel.
[02:26:58.618 --> 02:27:03.067]  I mean, this sounds like pretty serious, pretty imminent, and they've told us it's imminent.
[02:27:03.067 --> 02:27:04.450]  You know they're directing from above.
[02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:05.573]  What else politically?
[02:27:05.573 --> 02:27:08.178]  Let's get into your report first, then we'll talk about big picture.
[02:27:08.993 --> 02:27:17.576]  Well, it's interesting because you've got a number of... the level of coordination, I suppose, because of this limited segment.
[02:27:17.576 --> 02:27:28.939]  The level of coordination between the foot soldiers and the people that are giving the orders is not what anyone expected, at least on... Graded on 1 to 10.
[02:27:28.939 --> 02:27:32.780]  Let's say Special Forces is a 9, nobody gets a 10.
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:35.881]  You know, your average idiot antifa can't wipe their ass a 2.
[02:27:35.881 --> 02:27:36.402]  I mean, is this a 7 and 8?
[02:27:36.402 --> 02:27:36.722]  What is it?
[02:27:37.947 --> 02:27:41.191]  Maybe about a six or a seven, frankly.
[02:27:41.191 --> 02:27:45.636]  Surprisingly efficient with respect to the communications.
[02:27:45.636 --> 02:27:55.348]  And they're bringing in operational security specialists, veterans, anti-war people, people who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:27:56.088 --> 02:27:58.250]  Uh, who are against the war.
[02:27:58.250 --> 02:28:00.532]  Reminiscent of the anti-Vietnam era.
[02:28:00.532 --> 02:28:04.115]  But bringing in these kind of specialists to advise them on operational security.
[02:28:04.115 --> 02:28:10.360]  But in a civil war, and I'm going to give you the floor when we come back, in a civil war, I'm not, I mean, isn't it time that they're going to just do whatever?
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:15.023]  At certain points when there's no command and control, folks locally are going to have to deal with these people.
[02:28:15.023 --> 02:28:16.264]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:16.264 --> 02:28:23.170]  Yeah, and I think... You know what I'm saying, we didn't start this, but we just can't sit here and let these people run around and kill hundreds of cops.
[02:28:23.945 --> 02:28:25.347]  No, exactly.
[02:28:25.347 --> 02:28:26.708]  You're exactly right.
[02:28:26.708 --> 02:28:36.398]  And these people now recognize the fact that the right or the conservatives, the Second Amendment, pro-Second Amendment people with the concealed weapons represent a threat to them.
[02:28:36.398 --> 02:28:40.222]  They can't match concealed weapons.
[02:28:40.222 --> 02:28:41.763]  I noticed that's next in your memo.
[02:28:41.763 --> 02:28:46.068]  The commies are really pissed that we laid down that emergency backup for them.
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.240]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:28:48.240 --> 02:29:08.724]  So, all of this combined, and you've got this weird, and we can get into this later after the break, but we get this weird amalgamation, this odd amalgamation of various groups that have short-term and long-term goals, but everybody from the black activist groups to the gender identity groups that are combining forces.
[02:29:08.724 --> 02:29:13.145]  See, I showed your intel so good, I would not have said this on air, because they'd attack me, but I'll say it.
[02:29:13.145 --> 02:29:15.305]  I've seen people with the bike locks, the physical attacks.
[02:29:16.165 --> 02:29:16.925]  My own crew.
[02:29:16.925 --> 02:29:19.166]  It's like usually trannies are attacking.
[02:29:19.166 --> 02:29:22.427]  It's this bizarreness where it's trannies attacking.
[02:29:22.427 --> 02:29:24.008]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:29:24.008 --> 02:29:28.409]  It's beyond... I'm gonna shut up even though this is so riveting and so real.

[02:31:23.044 --> 02:31:31.788]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[02:31:58.644 --> 02:32:00.726]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:32:00.726 --> 02:32:06.030]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:09.553]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[02:32:09.733 --> 02:32:09.973]  I'm good.
[02:32:33.203 --> 02:32:35.245]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[02:32:35.245 --> 02:32:43.532]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.

[02:32:56.755 --> 02:32:59.438]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:32:59.438 --> 02:33:02.421]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:02.421 --> 02:33:08.207]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.207 --> 02:33:09.949]  The lonely city.
[02:33:09.949 --> 02:33:18.197]  The lonely city.
[02:33:21.932 --> 02:33:34.777]  I gotta tell you, just watching the people Trump has, like his Homeland Security spokesman, that guy is super informed, super on target, hearing the briefings, who they're putting in place, how they were all ready.
[02:33:34.777 --> 02:33:41.900]  It is like night and day, the bumbling politicos that Obama and George Bush put in.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:44.541]  I mean, this is just night and day.
[02:33:44.541 --> 02:33:47.903]  And so, of course, they're saying, oh, it's incompetent, he doesn't care.
[02:33:47.903 --> 02:33:50.784]  But I'm looking at this hurricane, Hurricane Harvey.
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:54.601]  I went on air today at like 11.
[02:33:54.601 --> 02:33:55.901]  I said, reporters get down there.
[02:33:55.901 --> 02:33:56.342]  I hope they took 37.
[02:33:56.342 --> 02:34:01.664]  Then we need to go to the coast, but just part way down to show the evacuation, the stores that are all cleaned out.
[02:34:01.664 --> 02:34:07.966]  I mean, it is five hours, four hours from hitting and already it is bad.
[02:34:07.966 --> 02:34:10.588]  This is going to be bad, bad, bad.
[02:34:10.588 --> 02:34:12.508]  I predict a hundred people are going to die from this.
[02:34:12.508 --> 02:34:13.749]  Unfortunately, this is bad.
[02:34:14.369 --> 02:34:19.374]  Houston, again, three inches is not as bad as New Orleans, but it's basically built on a swamp.
[02:34:19.374 --> 02:34:21.577]  I mean, it's three inches, it floods.
[02:34:21.577 --> 02:34:24.720]  They're talking 35, 40 inches.
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.082]  And if that hurricane stalls, it could be even more.
[02:34:27.082 --> 02:34:29.305]  Wow, this is going to be a disaster.
[02:34:30.128 --> 02:34:32.769]  And so prayer for everybody, obviously.
[02:34:32.769 --> 02:34:40.031]  I've even got to get family moved out of an area where we've got a creek because it comes up to the house and they say if something hits, that's what 10 inches it does.
[02:34:40.031 --> 02:34:41.332]  We have like 40 inches.
[02:34:41.332 --> 02:34:45.533]  They've had hurricanes before, come up and park over Austin, had 20, 30 inches and it floods everything.
[02:34:45.533 --> 02:34:48.995]  So this is a whopper, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:48.995 --> 02:34:54.056]  And we're going to be here covering it at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:34:54.056 --> 02:34:55.297]  And we've got generator power.
[02:34:56.641 --> 02:35:01.002]  In other systems, we've got solar as well, but not extensive, so we're going to try to, the power does go up.
[02:35:01.002 --> 02:35:13.986]  We built an industrial area, so our power tends to stay on even when it goes off the rest of the city, because they've got some continuity of government systems here in Austin, so we picked an area where we're on the edge of the COG area.
[02:35:13.986 --> 02:35:15.567]  And again, that's all inside baseball.
[02:35:15.567 --> 02:35:18.488]  It's not a secret, it's just the public doesn't know how all this works.
[02:35:19.028 --> 02:35:28.693]  So you've got former CIA directors, you've got former deputy directors, you've got former deputy director of the FBI, Phil Mudd, all of them, saying, we're going to kill the president.
[02:35:28.693 --> 02:35:39.918]  That's to give their own people encouragement to go to the meetings and to get ready and load the weapons and the explosives and I guess they think they're going to kill police chiefs and talk show hosts and Congress folks.
[02:35:39.918 --> 02:35:43.299]  I mean, they've been beta testing and think there's not going to be struck back.
[02:35:45.638 --> 02:35:51.870]  I don't want to kill a bunch of idiot leftist people, but I mean, I'm not going to be the one coming after you.
[02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:53.252]  I really feel sorry for these people though.
[02:35:53.252 --> 02:35:54.134]  I mean, I'll tell them right now.
[02:35:55.280 --> 02:36:08.228]  Santa Claus has got a list and checked it twice and the Patriots are not going to be going after the stupid Antifa or the CIA leftists that have been embedded as analysts in towns and cities for decades and want to be part of a great commie overthrow.
[02:36:08.228 --> 02:36:16.193]  They think they're going to lead little teams of folks to bomb stuff and dump chlorine gas down high rise buildings, air conditioning vents and stuff we know they're planning.
[02:36:18.467 --> 02:36:23.808]  Everybody involved in running this, if you kick this off, you had better be on a jet out of here.
[02:36:23.808 --> 02:36:26.368]  A lot of globalists are smart, they've been getting out, it's been admitted.
[02:36:26.368 --> 02:36:42.291]  A lot of the big money is like, flown off to Europe, Monte Carlo, the Cook Islands, at least the Bahamas, or Roatan, or you know, even little cruddy third world areas, or you've run off to Kauai, Hawaii, or Tasmania.
[02:36:42.291 --> 02:36:47.612]  But all the mid-level folks that haven't, they've built safe houses under your mansion,
[02:36:49.031 --> 02:36:51.131]  Your name will be mud.
[02:36:51.131 --> 02:36:53.672]  That's not, I'm not the one calling for violence.
[02:36:53.672 --> 02:36:57.473]  But you are starting a fight with the violent people.
[02:36:57.473 --> 02:36:59.973]  With the people that actually know how to be violent.
[02:36:59.973 --> 02:37:01.353]  Historically.
[02:37:01.353 --> 02:37:08.855]  So, I'll take no pleasure in the fact that you are literally climbing into a wood chipping machine.
[02:37:08.855 --> 02:37:10.815]  But that's what I'm telling you.
[02:37:10.815 --> 02:37:12.656]  The Red Guards marching all over Austin.
[02:37:12.656 --> 02:37:13.396]  They're all over the country.
[02:37:13.396 --> 02:37:14.776]  They're attacking people everywhere.
[02:37:14.776 --> 02:37:15.836]  They are moving forward.
[02:37:15.836 --> 02:37:16.557]  They are intimidated.
[02:37:16.557 --> 02:37:17.677]  They did a beta test.
[02:37:17.677 --> 02:37:18.097]  We kill.
[02:37:19.139 --> 02:37:23.983]  Over a hundred cops and not a lot happened?
[02:37:23.983 --> 02:37:28.626]  You just think a cop here and there every few days getting killed and CNN going, well, they deserve it.
[02:37:28.626 --> 02:37:29.867]  That was a beta test.
[02:37:29.867 --> 02:37:35.091]  That was like a parrot tests another branch before it gets on it called testing the perch.
[02:37:35.091 --> 02:37:37.774]  You got a parrot on your arm and you try to put them on a branch.
[02:37:37.774 --> 02:37:39.655]  They put their beak on it first.
[02:37:39.655 --> 02:37:42.217]  Now that beak is just tested to see that branch is there.
[02:37:42.217 --> 02:37:46.160]  It's a hundred times the weight when the parrot gets on.
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:47.161]  They just tested the perch.
[02:37:48.979 --> 02:38:00.047]  So, understand that, that they want the cops to get so paranoid they run into their fortresses when this kicks off, so they can then demand stuff from the city council, like, oh take a statue down or we'll kill you.
[02:38:00.047 --> 02:38:07.332]  Prison, oh 50 cops got killed, well you deserve it, let us take control of the department, put our people in, say you're with us and we'll stop killing you.
[02:38:07.332 --> 02:38:11.916]  Okay, we're made a deal with the Antifa and then it's over, because then they're going to march you in against us.
[02:38:13.917 --> 02:38:16.118]  What has to happen has to happen.
[02:38:16.118 --> 02:38:23.300]  So, I'm just telling you, you're afraid of the anti-fine, the communist police, and I don't think you are, but your bosses are compromised.
[02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:26.221]  You better be afraid of the real civil war.
[02:38:26.221 --> 02:38:31.222]  And I'm not here operationally planning anything myself, even though I got that area of my brain, more than most.
[02:38:31.222 --> 02:38:33.803]  The people that do are waiting for you.
[02:38:33.803 --> 02:38:34.663]  They are waiting.
[02:38:34.663 --> 02:38:37.684]  And so, look, your boss has already got out of the country.
[02:38:39.406 --> 02:38:45.150]  So, understand, you pull this off, there isn't one of you that is going to escape judgment.
[02:38:45.150 --> 02:38:46.051]  Not one.
[02:38:46.051 --> 02:38:48.092]  Now, you've got the floor, my friend.
[02:38:48.092 --> 02:38:53.656]  Go over this Doug Hagman, investigator, police trainer, great source of intel, broken so many big stories here.
[02:38:53.656 --> 02:38:56.398]  Walk through, at the beginning, your whole memo.
[02:38:56.398 --> 02:38:56.998]  I'm going to shut up.
[02:38:56.998 --> 02:38:57.459]  You've got the floor.
[02:38:58.815 --> 02:39:00.436]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:39:00.436 --> 02:39:13.221]  And just to recap, just so people know, I've managed to organize a group of volunteer accredited licensed investigators all across the country.
[02:39:13.221 --> 02:39:14.161]  Just a handful.
[02:39:14.161 --> 02:39:15.702]  To do what Project Veritas has done.
[02:39:15.702 --> 02:39:16.202]  Recap that.
[02:39:17.383 --> 02:39:18.504]  That's right.
[02:39:18.504 --> 02:39:27.772]  To infiltrate, to investigate and infiltrate these fascist groups that operate under the pretext of anti-fascism.
[02:39:27.772 --> 02:39:34.598]  Groups such as, but not necessarily Antifa, Black Lives Matter and so on.
[02:39:34.598 --> 02:39:37.541]  Revolutionary abolitionist movement and others like that.
[02:39:38.241 --> 02:39:53.772]  And we've found, especially last evening, I'm able to say this, one of the investigators was able to infiltrate a meeting last night on the West Coast in the San Francisco area and was just astounded by what he saw.
[02:39:53.772 --> 02:40:01.158]  And by the way, the attendance there was in the double digits, low to mid-double digits.
[02:40:01.158 --> 02:40:04.060]  Again, not wanting to give too much away for our operational security reasons.
[02:40:05.380 --> 02:40:18.365]  The age range was anywhere between, in his estimation, the eldest there being late 60s, perhaps early 70s, surprisingly, to as young as a late teenager.
[02:40:18.365 --> 02:40:32.650]  And these groups, or this group, they're aligning with other such fascist violent groups, groups that are, that comprise the resist fascism meme or narrative.
[02:40:33.411 --> 02:40:53.312]  And they are now partnering with various black activist groups, Central American, Mexican, other than Mexican immigration groups, Muslim, black, and Arab-Muslim groups, and the subgroups thereof, such as the pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli groups.
[02:40:54.012 --> 02:41:01.057]  This is not your ordinary vanilla kind of operation or just thrown-together operation.
[02:41:01.057 --> 02:41:05.279]  This is a highly organized operation.
[02:41:05.279 --> 02:41:15.765]  Even the invitation, for example, was even done in a manner which you would not ordinarily... I mean, it's not a poster on a telephone pole or a flyer on a windshield.
[02:41:15.765 --> 02:41:19.708]  It was done via the Internet through social networking.
[02:41:19.708 --> 02:41:23.150]  And so you have to know what you're looking for to really get invited to these groups.
[02:41:24.025 --> 02:41:29.069]  Their infrastructure, their objectives, I suppose, they're pretty clear.
[02:41:29.069 --> 02:41:34.692]  And they're unanimous, or relatively unanimous, or synonymous with one another.
[02:41:34.692 --> 02:41:43.778]  Building resistance inside the United States to take down Donald Trump, the president, the presidency of Donald Trump, and of course, ultimately, our constitutional republic.
[02:41:43.778 --> 02:41:48.882]  And take down our capital, the system of capitalism, replace it with communism, that's their stated objective.
[02:41:49.716 --> 02:42:02.100]  With respect to the revolutionary abolitionist movement, now this is not necessarily where this investigator was, their stated objective is to build the resistance infrastructure here in the United States.
[02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:16.705]  They don't believe that the Civil War was ever resolved and they want to, or they believe that the Civil War just transferred from that war into, it transitioned into a prison industrial complex.
[02:42:16.705 --> 02:42:17.545]  That's what they believe.
[02:42:18.459 --> 02:42:34.780]  The modeling in that case, they're modeling their organization tactics and operational mode of operation along the Rojava revolutionary groups in Syria, northern Syria.
[02:42:35.549 --> 02:42:46.039]  Their short-term objective is to build the infrastructure of support to provide support to fascist groups like Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other such groups.
[02:42:46.039 --> 02:42:54.706]  Long-term, just to burn this country down, replace its government, and basically kill all of the people who don't agree with them.
[02:42:54.706 --> 02:42:59.290]  We're talking about a pure Stalinist-like purge here in the United States.
[02:42:59.290 --> 02:43:00.472]  That's what they want to do.
[02:43:00.472 --> 02:43:01.973]  Very similar to the weather underground.
[02:43:02.333 --> 02:43:03.093]  Back in the 60s, early 70s.
[02:43:18.616 --> 02:43:21.838]  I 100% agree with you.
[02:43:21.838 --> 02:43:43.610]  In fact, it was stated to me during my briefing this morning, they actually are compiling a list, when I say they, I'm talking about this particular group as well as others, are compiling lists of mayors, city managers, city planners, city officials who are sympathetic to their causes, that will work with them.
[02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:45.471]  And it's to that level.
[02:43:45.971 --> 02:43:56.336]  And the next level above that, academia and the mainstream media, the captured corporate media, working with NGOs that actually are
[02:43:57.685 --> 02:44:10.791]  Shall we say, have an allegiance to the Obama regime, the Hillary Clinton people, but the Obama holdovers, and especially those within the Department of Justice.
[02:44:10.791 --> 02:44:24.737]  But the bottom line here, the targets that they're going after in the immediate are the civilians who are openly conservative and openly supportive of Donald Trump.
[02:44:25.517 --> 02:44:27.818]  In the capitalistic society in which we live.
[02:44:27.818 --> 02:44:33.019]  This is a main bullying operation to have the media even say this is okay when they do it.
[02:44:33.019 --> 02:44:34.840]  It's a response to the fascism.
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.380]  It's a response to the racism.
[02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:39.161]  When the Soros groups attacks that have overthrown other countries.
[02:44:39.161 --> 02:44:45.103]  We've seen the same shake and bake, the Arab Spring, same thing in European countries, same thing in Ukraine.
[02:44:45.103 --> 02:44:49.704]  Give legitimacy to it and then hope everybody else just cowers and rolls over to them.
[02:44:49.704 --> 02:44:51.525]  Which is not going to happen, Mr. Mudd.
[02:44:53.066 --> 02:44:53.647]  Exactly.
[02:44:53.647 --> 02:44:56.189]  Yeah, it's not.
[02:44:56.189 --> 02:45:05.176]  And I think that they are preparing for blowback because they're bringing in professionals to teach self-defense, to teach gun handling, gun safety.
[02:45:05.176 --> 02:45:07.618]  Good, more targets!
[02:45:07.618 --> 02:45:08.219]  Exactly.
[02:45:08.739 --> 02:45:15.141]  You know, the very people who say we're anti-gun are actually training and bringing in people to train them.
[02:45:15.141 --> 02:45:20.983]  Oh, that was the main tweet when the ACLU tweeted out a picture of a little white baby with an American flag saying, our future is freedom.
[02:45:20.983 --> 02:45:25.484]  They said no, and they showed blacks with guns basically killing white kids, and it was white people doing it.
[02:45:25.484 --> 02:45:27.184]  This is total mental illness.
[02:45:27.184 --> 02:45:34.146]  It's like a mix of fascism and communism and KKK, but it's anti-white, and it's weird white people running, and I don't know what's going on.
[02:45:34.146 --> 02:45:35.707]  This is like, these people are crazy.
[02:45:36.516 --> 02:45:39.498]  Yeah, haven't they seen what happened in Venezuela or North Korea?
[02:45:39.498 --> 02:45:42.540]  What is their problem?
[02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:48.905]  That's, you know, that Cloward-Piven Venezuelan model is exactly what they're after.
[02:45:48.905 --> 02:45:50.626]  That chaos is what they're after.
[02:45:50.626 --> 02:45:54.308]  They're using the Alinsky tactics.
[02:45:54.308 --> 02:45:55.489]  That's what they want.
[02:45:55.489 --> 02:45:56.870]  Exactly.
[02:45:56.870 --> 02:45:58.191]  So what does the President do?
[02:45:58.191 --> 02:45:58.792]  What do we do?
[02:45:58.792 --> 02:46:03.155]  Because they're crazy enough to telegraph a month ago that in two months they're going to take the President out.
[02:46:03.815 --> 02:46:07.678]  Okay, and they said back in July we're going to have us, you know, violence and blame the right wing.
[02:46:07.678 --> 02:46:08.779]  Soros admitted it.
[02:46:08.779 --> 02:46:10.160]  So here we are.
[02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.923]  They admit what they're doing, obviously to telegraph confidence to their own people.
[02:46:13.923 --> 02:46:15.945]  People say, why would you give out operational information?
[02:46:15.945 --> 02:46:22.470]  They have to to get people wound up to go, you know, dump chemicals down the skyscraper and go shoot people at the school and blame it on patriots.
[02:46:22.470 --> 02:46:24.592]  I mean, they're going to do false flags on us, too.
[02:46:24.592 --> 02:46:27.875]  Make no mistake, they're going to run false flags and blame us, have the media ready.
[02:46:27.875 --> 02:46:29.937]  Then they're going to launch the counter-op.
[02:46:29.937 --> 02:46:31.098]  They'll launch the false flag.
[02:46:31.758 --> 02:46:32.779]  They'll blow up the federal building.
[02:46:32.779 --> 02:46:33.679]  They'll shoot up the school.
[02:46:33.679 --> 02:46:36.360]  They'll have the Alex Jones or Trump supporters say they did it.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:37.261]  Be one of their people.
[02:46:37.261 --> 02:46:39.122]  They got folks ready to suicide mission.
[02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:40.583]  They caught him running the last stop.
[02:46:40.583 --> 02:46:41.943]  That'll be phase one.
[02:46:41.943 --> 02:46:44.705]  Phase two, about a week in, is, you know, you need to resign.
[02:46:44.705 --> 02:46:49.547]  Trump, start burning cities down and then killing cops everywhere, thinking we'll capitulate.
[02:46:49.547 --> 02:46:51.908]  But what do we do beforehand to stop him?
[02:46:51.908 --> 02:46:57.211]  I think Trump has to move against, let's play a clip of Maxine Waters telling her constituents, we're moving!
[02:46:57.211 --> 02:46:58.512]  We're coming for you!
[02:46:58.512 --> 02:46:58.972]  Here it is.
[02:47:01.345 --> 02:47:03.727]  Here is Maxine Waters.
[02:47:03.727 --> 02:47:06.949]  I don't care how big you are.
[02:47:06.949 --> 02:47:10.732]  I don't care how high you think you are.
[02:47:10.732 --> 02:47:12.713]  If you come for me, I'm coming for you.
[02:47:12.713 --> 02:47:14.134]  We didn't come for you, you idiot.
[02:47:14.134 --> 02:47:15.916]  We tried to cut taxes.
[02:47:15.916 --> 02:47:17.377]  Power people, you horrible slob.
[02:47:18.914 --> 02:47:30.040]  And so, whether it's the President of the United States of America, or any of his cabinet, we will say to them, we will resist you.
[02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:34.602]  We will not allow you to damage this country in the way that you're doing.
[02:47:34.602 --> 02:47:35.102]  Damage it?
[02:47:35.102 --> 02:47:38.264]  We will not allow you to take us backwards.
[02:47:38.264 --> 02:47:42.226]  Not only will we resist you, we will impeach you, Mr. President!
[02:47:42.226 --> 02:47:46.728]  And then look at all these soft people.
[02:47:48.918 --> 02:47:53.280]  Even the white ladies that are in it, like, creep their hair into a thing, like, trying to, like, we're black.
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:56.360]  It's just, I feel so sorry for black people led by people like this lady.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:01.422]  Thank God George Foreman and, you know, so many other people are speaking out against this.
[02:48:01.422 --> 02:48:02.442]  This is just madness.
[02:48:02.442 --> 02:48:06.163]  But, you know, I've statistically been out at these events and seen it myself.
[02:48:06.163 --> 02:48:07.683]  There's really almost no black people.
[02:48:07.683 --> 02:48:08.644]  They don't seem to be buying into it.
[02:48:08.644 --> 02:48:10.284]  It's almost all white people.
[02:48:10.284 --> 02:48:11.424]  I don't set a virtue signal.
[02:48:11.424 --> 02:48:14.325]  People have seen my live feeds in Austin, my live feeds elsewhere.
[02:48:14.325 --> 02:48:14.785]  It's 80% white.
[02:48:14.785 --> 02:48:14.825]  So,
[02:48:18.922 --> 02:48:19.542]  It's just crazy.
[02:48:19.542 --> 02:48:22.103]  What do you think is really happening here?
[02:48:22.103 --> 02:48:37.528]  Well, you know, I think, and this is just my supposition based on reasoned analysis, I do believe that the shadow government of which the Deep State is a part of, a subgroup of, is in charge of all of this.
[02:48:37.528 --> 02:48:42.429]  And if I can connect some seemingly disparate dots here, I do believe that many
[02:48:42.449 --> 02:48:47.630]  Many of our congressmen and women have been compromised, are being blackmailed.
[02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:50.510]  You've got the one spy ring in Congress.
[02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:54.971]  You've got the server situation, the email situation.
[02:48:54.971 --> 02:49:08.434]  You've got this NSA, this massive NSA and national, or NSA and CIA and NRO surveillance program that has perhaps captured so much information about our leaders.
[02:49:08.434 --> 02:49:10.414]  Which they admit is used for blackmail against patriots.
[02:49:11.129 --> 02:49:12.029]  Right, exactly.
[02:49:12.029 --> 02:49:24.735]  So you've got compromise from within by both the, I'm going to say the Muslims, Pakistani nationals in one case, the green-red axis.
[02:49:24.735 --> 02:49:28.297]  You've got a coalition that wants to overthrow America and fight over the spoils later.
[02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:30.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:42.503]  And they're working together right now, but I'm sure at some point one is going to exert dominance over another, one group over another, and I think that, you know, of course the red over the green will win out in this case.
[02:49:42.503 --> 02:49:46.484]  But this is a deep state operation at the highest levels.
[02:49:46.484 --> 02:49:56.526]  I truly believe that because you don't fund something like this, and you certainly don't organize something like this on a budget that you see some of these cannon fodder idiots out there.
[02:49:56.526 --> 02:49:57.046]  No, I agree.
[02:49:57.046 --> 02:49:57.786]  And I've got to give it.
[02:49:58.426 --> 02:50:02.632]  To the Democrats and the globalists, they got some big huevos to pull something like this.
[02:50:02.632 --> 02:50:09.922]  I mean, this is basically the Democrats in Deep State planning a mass cop-killing, citizen-killing, hardcore authoritarian coup like 1917 Russia.
[02:50:09.922 --> 02:50:11.805]  I mean, they think they're going to execute that?
[02:50:11.805 --> 02:50:12.226]  Huh!
[02:50:12.226 --> 02:50:13.507]  They have got another thing coming.
[02:50:14.798 --> 02:50:20.201]  Yeah, and they want to implement the very thing that they say that they're against.
[02:50:20.201 --> 02:50:27.785]  And that's why people get confused, I think, and they're using these Olinsky tactics, tactics of Saul Olinsky, against us.
[02:50:27.785 --> 02:50:28.866]  That's their motive of operation.
[02:50:28.866 --> 02:50:35.250]  Well, let's talk about the Iwan brothers and that indictment that you and many others broke, and where all that's going, as Trump is starting to strike back.
[02:50:35.250 --> 02:50:39.752]  They're trying to isolate him, claiming as we can focus, but we're going to get your intel on that.
[02:50:39.752 --> 02:50:42.634]  But man, I tell you, this is an exciting time to be alive.
[02:50:42.634 --> 02:50:42.794]  Wow!
[02:50:43.314 --> 02:50:47.046]  We got a big storm barreling down on us, and it's not Harvey.
[02:50:47.046 --> 02:50:48.651]  We know Harvey's important.
[02:50:48.651 --> 02:50:50.456]  Now it's the storm of tyranny, and it's here.
[02:50:52.449 --> 02:50:54.550]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:56.530]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[02:50:56.530 --> 02:50:57.751]  Their warhead of choice?
[02:50:57.751 --> 02:50:59.251]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[02:50:59.251 --> 02:51:00.672]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[02:51:00.672 --> 02:51:03.132]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.
[02:51:03.132 --> 02:51:03.853]  Are you ready?

[02:54:13.762 --> 02:54:29.712]  I'm about to break down one of the most profound things I've ever said in 22 years on air.
[02:54:29.712 --> 02:54:30.673]  Because it all clicked.
[02:54:32.045 --> 02:54:47.906]  During the break, I walked out to the crew and I said, this is the Bolshevik Revolution 2.0, but just as the Bolshevik Revolution was funded by big powerful banks that wanted to sack and conquer Russia, and replace one old system with a very anti-Christian authoritarian system.
[02:54:49.915 --> 02:54:56.200]  Just as they did it, just as they modeled that attack, that's their attack coming up in the next few months.
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:00.062]  And Daria, whose family fled communism, is an army veteran and a patriot.
[02:55:00.062 --> 02:55:01.183]  She's from Russia.
[02:55:01.183 --> 02:55:02.484]  She said, Alex, don't you see?
[02:55:02.484 --> 02:55:03.745]  It's October.
[02:55:03.745 --> 02:55:06.407]  It's 100 years since the Bolshevik takeover.
[02:55:07.568 --> 02:55:20.696]  Because I was saying, we've got to look at the Bolshevik attack, that's the same attack pattern, the same big banks, the same Eastern elites, the same program, trying it here in America where they get central control, then order the military to order you to turn in the guns.
[02:55:20.696 --> 02:55:28.922]  Once you do that, they kill the military command, they knock out the opposition parties that they've gotten to, because they told the opposition, we're about to overthrow.
[02:55:28.922 --> 02:55:33.365]  The opposition went along thinking they were getting a seat at the table, they're going to annihilate all of them.
[02:55:34.005 --> 02:55:40.150]  Then I realized it's the Trotskyites, the neocons, were kicked out by Stalin.
[02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:50.097]  Trotsky went to Mexico, got killed, and then his right-hand people came here and said we're going to take over the Republican Party because it was the opposition to Bolshevism in America!
[02:55:50.097 --> 02:55:57.863]  And then the very ones turn around and say the Republicans are the Communists, when as flawed as they are, they're the party that wasn't.
[02:55:57.863 --> 02:56:01.366]  And see, I'm cursed with history, but it's hiding in plain view.
[02:56:02.546 --> 02:56:04.927]  And I'm going to host the fourth hour.
[02:56:04.927 --> 02:56:06.308]  Roger Stone can't get his Skype up.
[02:56:06.308 --> 02:56:06.708]  It's fine.
[02:56:06.708 --> 02:56:08.629]  I'm going to host, but he'll be on the phone.
[02:56:08.629 --> 02:56:10.210]  But wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[02:56:10.210 --> 02:56:11.911]  We'll have live feeds of the hurricane.
[02:56:11.911 --> 02:56:18.575]  But there is no doubt they're saying on CNN, MSNBC, we're going to overthrow the president.
[02:56:18.575 --> 02:56:19.675]  We're going to get violent.
[02:56:19.675 --> 02:56:20.856]  We're going to kill people.
[02:56:20.856 --> 02:56:22.277]  Antifa is good.
[02:56:22.277 --> 02:56:22.857]  Hashtag
[02:56:24.588 --> 02:56:25.509]  Kill Republicans.
[02:56:25.509 --> 02:56:26.749]  Hunt Republicans.
[02:56:26.749 --> 02:56:27.370]  Wolf Blitzer.
[02:56:27.370 --> 02:56:31.772]  Well, the guy that shot the folks that shot Scalise, he wasn't hateful.
[02:56:31.772 --> 02:56:33.193]  He just didn't like Trump.
[02:56:33.193 --> 02:56:41.178]  They are really crazy enough to try it, and I don't want to run down the poor Russians under the czars and how poor they were, and that was still kind of futile.
[02:56:42.336 --> 02:56:44.559]  Maybe we're more decadent.
[02:56:44.559 --> 02:56:45.701]  They were poor and not decadent.
[02:56:45.701 --> 02:56:46.783]  We're just decadent slobs.
[02:56:46.783 --> 02:56:48.725]  Maybe we will be rolled over.
[02:56:48.725 --> 02:56:50.988]  But I don't think it's going to go well.
[02:56:50.988 --> 02:56:56.015]  But if they do announce centralization, turn in the guns, kill Trump, kill the leaders, folks, no.
[02:56:56.015 --> 02:56:57.397]  Just go after their leadership.
[02:56:58.038 --> 02:56:58.879]  We're going to beat them.
[02:56:58.879 --> 02:57:00.360]  They're not going to take the country.
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:01.521]  If they can try to get D.C.
[02:57:01.521 --> 02:57:05.364]  to totally capitulate, then other state governors, they've got a C.O.G.
[02:57:05.364 --> 02:57:10.228]  under Obama to go in and take out state governors, have special forces take over capitals.
[02:57:10.228 --> 02:57:13.230]  Special forces, they don't have their robots and missiles in yet.
[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:14.631]  Do not follow those orders.
[02:57:14.631 --> 02:57:17.033]  Understand, we can save the republic.
[02:57:17.033 --> 02:57:19.776]  And I'm already putting out stuff here in case we lose the first round.
[02:57:20.236 --> 02:57:22.559]  But I think we're going to win the second round no matter.
[02:57:22.559 --> 02:57:23.620]  I think we're going to win the first.
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:25.602]  But I think we've got to be honest.
[02:57:25.602 --> 02:57:26.603]  I'm clear, Doug.
[02:57:26.603 --> 02:57:30.388]  They are beginning to launch the second Bolshevik Revolution in November, October.
[02:57:30.388 --> 02:57:31.990]  They think they'll be in full control of D.C.
[02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.971]  by October.
[02:57:32.971 --> 02:57:35.454]  And on the 100th anniversary, they intend to bring down the U.S.
[02:57:36.602 --> 02:57:51.299]  Oh, you know what, to have such a robust understanding of history, I think it's so necessary now more than ever and I think that's a very good analogy and a good synopsis because I think that's exactly what we're seeing and it is kind of a duck or bleed scenario.
[02:57:51.299 --> 02:57:51.820]  Yeah, we might
[02:57:52.620 --> 02:57:55.141]  I'm sure we will take a few.
[02:57:55.141 --> 02:57:59.162]  But in the end, or in the second round, I think we're going to come back and prevail.
[02:57:59.162 --> 02:58:03.564]  So you're absolutely correct, in my view anyway, on your analysis.
[02:58:03.564 --> 02:58:05.284]  The people have got to get.
[02:58:05.284 --> 02:58:06.425]  We're going to win.
[02:58:06.425 --> 02:58:08.505]  There won't be any communication or command and control.
[02:58:08.505 --> 02:58:09.006]  Hit them!
[02:58:09.006 --> 02:58:09.486]  Don't stop!
[02:58:10.106 --> 02:58:12.147]  You gotta be ready once they start killing everybody.
[02:58:12.147 --> 02:58:12.868]  You gotta go.
[02:58:12.868 --> 02:58:13.428]  You gotta go.
[02:58:13.428 --> 02:58:14.789]  You gotta take it to them.
[02:58:14.789 --> 02:58:16.811]  Just go after the commie dirtbags and get them.
[02:58:16.811 --> 02:58:17.971]  That's the number one thing.
[02:58:17.971 --> 02:58:19.292]  Get them and don't stop.
[02:58:19.292 --> 02:58:23.815]  And understand, you turn your guns in, they're gonna string you and your wife up and rape your kids in front of you.
[02:58:23.815 --> 02:58:26.937]  Just like Lenin did all over Eastern Europe.
[02:58:26.937 --> 02:58:28.679]  They want to murder and rape Christians.
[02:58:28.679 --> 02:58:29.779]  They're pedophiles.
[02:58:29.779 --> 02:58:30.800]  We'll be back with 4th Hour.
[02:58:30.800 --> 02:58:32.261]  Five more minutes with Doug Ackman.
[02:58:32.501 --> 02:58:33.584]  Then Roger Stone.
[02:58:33.584 --> 02:58:36.913]  This is real, it's happening, and we're here raising the alarm.
[02:58:36.913 --> 02:58:38.518]  Worldwide, Paul Revere 2.0.
[02:58:38.518 --> 02:58:39.099]  Join us now!
[02:58:42.512 --> 02:58:45.133]  After being sold, not a grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:58:45.133 --> 02:58:46.453]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:58:46.453 --> 02:58:47.653]  Why is this so good?
[02:58:47.653 --> 02:58:52.955]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:58:52.955 --> 02:59:06.498]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:59:06.498 --> 02:59:07.839]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:59:08.759 --> 02:59:10.280]  Spreading disease around.
[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:12.782]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:59:12.782 --> 02:59:14.163]  These are all parasites.
[02:59:14.163 --> 02:59:15.263]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:59:15.263 --> 02:59:16.604]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:59:16.604 --> 02:59:21.107]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:59:21.107 --> 02:59:24.269]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:59:24.269 --> 02:59:27.451]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:59:27.451 --> 02:59:28.492]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:59:28.492 --> 02:59:29.313]  Living Defense.
[02:59:29.313 --> 02:59:30.413]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:30.413 --> 02:59:31.454]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:59:31.454 --> 02:59:33.055]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body.
[02:59:33.055 --> 02:59:33.475]  Period.
[02:59:35.016 --> 02:59:36.056]  You support the broadcast.
[02:59:36.056 --> 02:59:37.397]  Infowarslive.com.
[02:59:37.397 --> 02:59:39.658]  Thank you, Dr. Groot from the Global Healing Center.
[02:59:39.658 --> 02:59:46.020]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:59:46.020 --> 02:59:48.621]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.886 --> 03:00:03.009]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:03.009 --> 03:00:08.954]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.954 --> 03:00:14.998]  I was thinking about how big the stakes are.
[03:00:14.998 --> 03:00:19.602]  How we always heard about a global one world government, communist takeover of America.
[03:00:19.602 --> 03:00:20.923]  Now I can turn on any channel.
[03:00:22.449 --> 03:00:28.432]  And they've got actors playing me saying, I'm Alex Jones and I'm a racist, or all this crazy stuff I told on other channels.
[03:00:28.432 --> 03:00:29.593]  They're saying we're going to kill Trump.
[03:00:29.593 --> 03:00:32.594]  They got former CIA directors and deputy directors saying it.
[03:00:32.594 --> 03:00:39.178]  And then we have investigators out there like Veritas and like what the Northeast Intelligence Network and Hagman and Hagman are doing.
[03:00:39.178 --> 03:00:40.218]  And they get the same intel.
[03:00:40.218 --> 03:00:42.559]  And I see it on the streets.
[03:00:42.559 --> 03:00:48.542]  People in business suits looking at me, guys making 300 grand a year, going, we're going to kill you.
[03:00:48.542 --> 03:00:51.344]  And it's like they're coming of age, like they're going to get me.
[03:00:53.556 --> 03:00:58.779]  And they, but first they're going to demonize who we are and just launch an all-out civil war.
[03:00:58.779 --> 03:01:01.860]  And CNN, when cops get killed, well, some cops are bad.
[03:01:01.860 --> 03:01:06.583]  So cops, reform yourself and you'll stop getting shot when you're pumping gas.
[03:01:06.583 --> 03:01:11.425]  How the hell is some cop in Houston shot in the back of the head while he's pumping gas his fault?
[03:01:11.425 --> 03:01:14.227]  Some cop might've done something wrong in Missouri, which they didn't.
[03:01:14.227 --> 03:01:18.429]  And it's not about worshiping police, but they're the detonator of a fake revolution.
[03:01:19.701 --> 03:01:28.086]  There's problems in police, but nothing compared to the communists, the socialists, and all the rest of it, and we sit here literally seeing them.
[03:01:28.086 --> 03:01:29.067]  I'm sure of it.
[03:01:29.067 --> 03:01:33.309]  Hell, they say they're getting ready to launch the second Bolshevik revolution.
[03:01:33.309 --> 03:01:35.251]  That's the primer to create the hysteria.
[03:01:35.251 --> 03:01:40.934]  Then the globals will come in with the UN and re-stabilize, and it won't be a pure Bolshevik system at first.
[03:01:40.934 --> 03:01:45.697]  But they're planning this, and they're calling Congress, and everybody's saying, it's about to come.
[03:01:45.697 --> 03:01:47.078]  You need to sit down, and we'll leave you alone.
[03:01:48.792 --> 03:01:52.034]  That's exactly what the Bolsheviks did when they only took Moscow for like a year.
[03:01:52.034 --> 03:01:58.579]  And they kept writing letters and sending emissaries saying, just give up to different garrisons of the military.
[03:01:58.579 --> 03:02:01.521]  Give up and we won't kill you and your family.
[03:02:01.521 --> 03:02:04.163]  They'd give up, they'd kill them.
[03:02:04.163 --> 03:02:07.286]  And you have to understand, you can't give up to this.
[03:02:07.286 --> 03:02:08.667]  That's how you lose.
[03:02:08.667 --> 03:02:10.168]  You don't give up.
[03:02:10.168 --> 03:02:13.811]  And I'll take no pleasure in a bloody war killing these people because they're animals.
[03:02:14.642 --> 03:02:15.683]  Okay?
[03:02:15.683 --> 03:02:16.623]  I take no pleasure.
[03:02:16.623 --> 03:02:18.625]  I want to stop this, but let me tell you something.
[03:02:18.625 --> 03:02:26.210]  We're going to smash these people, and when we take America back, if they launch this, we're going to wreck... You think there was a Nazi hunt?
[03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:31.574]  There's going to be a hunt for globalists the world's never seen, and there's going to be billion-dollar bounties on their heads, okay?
[03:02:31.574 --> 03:02:32.035]  None of them.
[03:02:32.035 --> 03:02:34.837]  George Soros, the globalist, there'll be nowhere to hide.
[03:02:34.837 --> 03:02:36.498]  You will fail.
[03:02:36.498 --> 03:02:37.979]  The problem is they don't mind dying.
[03:02:37.979 --> 03:02:40.100]  They're so satanic, they want this.
[03:02:40.100 --> 03:02:41.061]  You understand?
[03:02:41.061 --> 03:02:41.982]  That's what makes it so dangerous.
[03:02:41.982 --> 03:02:43.443]  A lot of top globalists, like Rockefeller,
[03:02:43.683 --> 03:02:46.667]  Brzezinski have died.
[03:02:46.667 --> 03:02:49.490]  Actually, they actually like the excitement of this, Doug.
[03:02:49.490 --> 03:02:50.932]  That's why they're such a dangerous enemy.
[03:02:50.932 --> 03:02:52.935]  That's why it's so sad.
[03:02:52.935 --> 03:02:54.637]  We have to warn the military and police right now.
[03:02:54.637 --> 03:02:56.039]  You're going to ride shotguns for the rest of the hour.
[03:02:56.039 --> 03:02:57.841]  Roger Stone, thanks for doing it.
[03:02:57.841 --> 03:02:59.303]  This is a real crossroads.
[03:02:59.303 --> 03:03:00.304]  This is for all the marbles.
[03:03:00.304 --> 03:03:01.125]  This is it.
[03:03:01.125 --> 03:03:02.246]  We always knew it was coming.
[03:03:02.246 --> 03:03:02.567]  It's here.
[03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:08.290]  It's crazy.
[03:03:08.290 --> 03:03:16.613]  I saw the comment made by Roger Stone at the, I think TMZ did a quick interview or a quick question and answer.
[03:03:16.613 --> 03:03:18.974]  And I'll tell you something, they want a civil war.
[03:03:18.974 --> 03:03:26.136]  Go ahead and keep that impeachment narrative, the impeachment objective going at the congressional levels.
[03:03:26.836 --> 03:03:32.801]  And the media push for this unfitness to be president.
[03:03:32.801 --> 03:03:34.202]  That's their narrative.
[03:03:34.202 --> 03:03:51.015]  Keep that going and you're going to see the difference being, of course, historically between then and now is the fact that there will be some pushback by the conservative right who are heavily armed or who are armed and ready to fight to protect our value system.
[03:03:51.035 --> 03:03:52.197]  That's right, that's right.
[03:04:06.579 --> 03:04:07.219]  Oh, heck yeah.
[03:04:07.219 --> 03:04:19.745]  Yeah, I mean, the police right now are essentially cannon fodder to these idiots out there that are dressed up like thugs with baseball bats with nails sticking out of them for crying out loud.
[03:04:19.745 --> 03:04:22.326]  So yeah, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:04:22.326 --> 03:04:29.269]  But the police also have to keep order, not listen to... No, I'm just saying they have to get out of our way.
[03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:30.330]  Oh, true, yeah.
[03:04:30.330 --> 03:04:32.231]  I don't like to talk like this.
[03:04:32.231 --> 03:04:32.931]  We're coming down on this.
[03:04:34.459 --> 03:04:35.019]  Well, yeah.
[03:04:35.019 --> 03:04:36.640]  I mean, look what we saw, too.
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:39.021]  Yeah, because these people want to kill you.
[03:04:39.021 --> 03:04:40.461]  We just want to have America.
[03:04:40.461 --> 03:04:42.602]  All we ask is, get out of the way.
[03:04:42.602 --> 03:04:43.302]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:43.302 --> 03:04:43.582]  Stay there.

[03:05:45.188 --> 03:05:46.629]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:05:49.153 --> 03:05:54.558]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:05:54.558 --> 03:05:57.400]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:05:57.400 --> 03:05:59.382]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:05:59.382 --> 03:06:04.406]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:06:04.406 --> 03:06:06.508]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:06:06.508 --> 03:06:07.789]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:06:07.789 --> 03:06:12.914]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:12.914 --> 03:06:16.277]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:06:16.357 --> 03:06:16.677]  I think so.
[03:06:39.440 --> 03:06:40.861]  Nano, silver, and more.
[03:06:40.861 --> 03:06:49.264]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWar while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[03:06:57.548 --> 03:06:58.769]  A 360 win.
[03:06:58.769 --> 03:07:01.370]  Number one, when you choose auto shit before checkout,
[03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:05.331]  We give you 10% off on your order at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:07:05.331 --> 03:07:13.254]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:13.254 --> 03:07:17.915]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:17.915 --> 03:07:24.417]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:24.417 --> 03:07:27.918]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com, select your favorite product or products,
[03:07:28.038 --> 03:07:32.221]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:32.221 --> 03:07:34.583]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[03:07:34.583 --> 03:07:39.426]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:39.426 --> 03:07:40.387]  10% off on AutoShip.

[03:08:00.279 --> 03:08:04.662]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:08:04.662 --> 03:08:08.525]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:19.233 --> 03:08:30.420]  Owen Schroyer and Harrison are the riders on the storm.
[03:08:30.420 --> 03:08:33.402]  They're on their way down just a few hours from where we sit.
[03:08:33.402 --> 03:08:34.722]  They're basically almost there.
[03:08:34.722 --> 03:08:36.163]  We need to get them on soon.
[03:08:36.163 --> 03:08:38.524]  We'll have some live feeds at Infowars.com.
[03:08:38.524 --> 03:08:39.485]  They'll just pop up there.
[03:08:39.485 --> 03:08:40.726]  We'll also email them to you at
[03:08:42.193 --> 03:08:43.974]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:08:43.974 --> 03:08:45.776]  Sign up for the free email.
[03:08:45.776 --> 03:08:49.958]  We'll send you those live feeds as they happen that are internet only.
[03:08:49.958 --> 03:08:56.042]  Our stations are welcome to pick those up, but we're going to have coverage of the big evacuation, the store shelves being cleaned out, all of it.
[03:08:56.042 --> 03:08:59.245]  Roger Stones riding shotgun with us via phone this hour.
[03:08:59.245 --> 03:09:08.051]  So is Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman.com, syndicated talk show host, police trainer, runs a big successful private investigator firm.
[03:09:08.051 --> 03:09:10.893]  He followed the Veritas model last year, got his people in.
[03:09:12.162 --> 03:09:23.647]  A lot of key positions, and now his investigators, liaison with law enforcement obviously, but you're not supposed to go directly with law enforcement because they get in trouble, so they go through the former law enforcement to give us the intel.
[03:09:23.647 --> 03:09:28.050]  They are in the meetings in San Francisco, you name it, and what they're saying internally mirrors...
[03:09:29.298 --> 03:09:33.600]  People like Maxine Waters last night in a speech saying, we're coming for you, we're bringing you down, Trump.
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:39.162]  And they're in the news saying, we're going to kill Trump supporters, we're going to hashtag hunt Republicans.
[03:09:39.162 --> 03:09:48.746]  And we've got the briefing here from our sources, law enforcement, military and investigators, how they're going to target civilian members of the pro-Trump communities for death.
[03:09:49.807 --> 03:09:51.910]  Judges, lawyers, members of Congress.
[03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:53.332]  You already saw Scalise.
[03:09:53.332 --> 03:09:56.296]  They're going to target white peace officers on site.
[03:09:56.296 --> 03:09:58.940]  They're going to go out and just shoot as many white cops as possible.
[03:09:58.940 --> 03:10:02.505]  That was only a test of the hundreds of dead cops you've seen in the last few years.
[03:10:02.505 --> 03:10:03.466]  We're talking hundreds a day.
[03:10:03.466 --> 03:10:04.908]  They're just going to slaughter them en masse.
[03:10:06.079 --> 03:10:17.105]  And then, after all of that, they're bringing in instruction on firearms, self-defense and counter-surveillance, anti-police workshops, self-defense workshops, weapons procurement, and handling.
[03:10:17.105 --> 03:10:24.729]  No one in the hundreds of years of combined research from the people he's talked to have seen anything like this.
[03:10:24.729 --> 03:10:29.412]  They say this is the Weathermen 2.0, and they talk about the Weathermen.
[03:10:30.252 --> 03:10:35.413]  And those bombings of police, military, universities that have military training, you name it.
[03:10:35.413 --> 03:10:38.014]  So, we're here to ride shotgun, but people just joined us.
[03:10:38.014 --> 03:10:40.395]  Doug Hagman, recap the magnitude.
[03:10:40.395 --> 03:10:43.695]  I mean, we basically confirmed, hell, they're in the news.
[03:10:43.695 --> 03:10:44.416]  People say, why?
[03:10:44.416 --> 03:10:45.916]  You never announced a military attack.
[03:10:45.916 --> 03:10:49.317]  Well, yeah, you do if you're trying to get your people confident to go out and
[03:10:50.237 --> 03:10:56.159]  Dump the chlorine gas down the air conditioning system of the high rises as we know they're training to do.
[03:10:56.159 --> 03:10:57.739]  They want mass death.
[03:10:57.739 --> 03:10:59.260]  They want total confusion.
[03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:00.520]  They want capitulation.
[03:11:00.520 --> 03:11:01.821]  Dead cops everywhere.
[03:11:01.821 --> 03:11:04.182]  The National Guard systems hit.
[03:11:04.182 --> 03:11:06.702]  Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers hit.
[03:11:06.702 --> 03:11:07.383]  Churches hit.
[03:11:07.383 --> 03:11:08.443]  Conservatives hit.
[03:11:08.443 --> 03:11:09.723]  Members of Congress hit.
[03:11:09.723 --> 03:11:10.984]  They plan when this rushes.
[03:11:11.784 --> 03:11:31.378]  For their October surprise, their October Bolshevik 100 years later, they plan, on my intel, on killing thousands in the first few days, to then have us sue for peace, agree to remove Trump, and then when they get central control and quote, new elections, we never have new elections again, COG, and then they start killing everybody.
[03:11:31.378 --> 03:11:33.860]  All the leadership will start getting arrested, getting killed.
[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:36.081]  Now I, because they admitted this in Atlantic Monthly.
[03:11:36.081 --> 03:11:37.603]  This is their COG plan.
[03:11:37.603 --> 03:11:38.903]  I've been briefed by folks that have seen
[03:11:40.545 --> 03:11:46.889]  Classified versions of Valkyrie from Germany, but also systems here that were floated in the 80s that congressional hearings on.
[03:11:46.889 --> 03:11:51.211]  They're planning to use Nuremberg's study of that plan, but actually against us.
[03:11:51.211 --> 03:11:55.974]  So, a Bolshevik revolution meets Operation Valkyrie against the American people.
[03:11:55.974 --> 03:11:58.196]  Doug Hagman, recap, then we're going to Roger Stone.
[03:11:59.420 --> 03:12:03.282]  Yeah, just briefly for those just joining.
[03:12:03.282 --> 03:12:11.967]  Essentially, we have a handful of investigators across the country, specific cities, infiltrating, investigating and infiltrating these fascist groups.
[03:12:11.967 --> 03:12:15.229]  They've successfully done so in many cases.
[03:12:15.229 --> 03:12:18.611]  The latest report early this morning, 410 Eastern Time this morning,
[03:12:19.251 --> 03:12:25.133]  Saying, look, this one particular meeting in San Francisco, so well organized.
[03:12:25.133 --> 03:12:29.254]  The tactics, the training, the training being very professional.
[03:12:29.254 --> 03:12:37.337]  The age of people there range from late 60s, perhaps early 70s, all the way down to late teens.
[03:12:37.337 --> 03:12:40.658]  This is the resist fascism movement.
[03:12:40.658 --> 03:12:43.059]  That's what they're calling themselves, but it's actually a fascist movement.
[03:12:43.059 --> 03:12:44.739]  And the report says it's a lot of professionals.
[03:12:44.739 --> 03:12:46.380]  These aren't just the average meth head.
[03:12:47.148 --> 03:12:47.888]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:12:47.888 --> 03:13:00.275]  These are the people who are sending out the cannon fodder, the idiots you see in the street with the baseball or the bicycle helmets on and the baseball bats.
[03:13:00.275 --> 03:13:07.879]  I mean, those people are the useful idiots that hire a stooge for a day or two and go out there and take a few whacks.
[03:13:07.879 --> 03:13:09.580]  That's who those people are.
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:11.001]  These people are the planners.
[03:13:11.001 --> 03:13:13.382]  These people are the architects of the chaos that we're seeing.
[03:13:13.382 --> 03:13:14.063]  The brains!
[03:13:14.583 --> 03:13:16.284]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:13:16.284 --> 03:13:21.947]  However, they're bringing in these professionals to teach, as you said, the weapons self-defense.
[03:13:21.947 --> 03:13:25.409]  They're force-multiplying a revolutionary group.
[03:13:25.409 --> 03:13:25.789]  Yep.
[03:13:25.789 --> 03:13:26.489]  Yeah.
[03:13:26.489 --> 03:13:28.931]  And to go against law enforcement as well.
[03:13:28.931 --> 03:13:31.672]  So the bottom line here is they want to burn everything down, baby.
[03:13:31.672 --> 03:13:34.033]  If they can't have it, which they can't, they didn't.
[03:13:34.033 --> 03:13:35.394]  Trump won.
[03:13:35.394 --> 03:13:36.215]  They're all over it.
[03:13:36.215 --> 03:13:37.575]  So burn it all down, baby.
[03:13:37.575 --> 03:13:38.636]  Burn it down to the ground.
[03:13:39.236 --> 03:13:55.329]  And by any means necessary to install a communist-type government, but cloak it in this anti-fascism movement, which is essentially... And by the way, I'm not an authoritarian, I'm anti-police state, not anti-police, but I know that security can come in a uniform.
[03:13:55.329 --> 03:14:01.915]  If they're planning the overthrow, admitting it, having former CIA Deputy Director saying, we're going to kill Trump soon, it's not authoritarian.
[03:14:02.515 --> 03:14:11.562]  To move against them paramilitarily, and they don't even make it to the police station, because you don't even need a judge or jury when you're trying to overthrow the whole country and say, kill the president.
[03:14:11.562 --> 03:14:13.223]  They just, they're never seen again.
[03:14:13.223 --> 03:14:19.007]  I mean, if they really want this war, and they want to kill hundreds of millions of people, potentially, I mean, a nuclear war could start over this.
[03:14:19.007 --> 03:14:20.908]  We have, I mean, I don't want to sound tough.
[03:14:20.908 --> 03:14:22.389]  I've never talked like this in 20 years.
[03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:23.670]  They're the ones wanting to push this.
[03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:25.091]  I mean, there's no half measures.
[03:14:25.091 --> 03:14:31.216]  We need to identify, not ourselves individually, but through Trump, through the patriots, through the government, identify
[03:14:31.696 --> 03:14:34.418]  Do we wait until they make their next big strike, or do we move now?
[03:14:34.418 --> 03:14:39.421]  Because every minute we sit here and don't tell ourselves the truth, we are in deep trouble.
[03:14:39.421 --> 03:14:41.802]  Only maximum commitment is going to defeat these people.
[03:14:42.802 --> 03:14:46.443]  Yeah, it's either duck, bleed, or fight back.
[03:14:46.443 --> 03:14:53.624]  And I think what we're doing by exposing and working with law enforcement, I think this is working out well.
[03:14:53.624 --> 03:14:57.865]  But there will come a point in time when we have to dig in and say, OK, you know what?
[03:14:57.865 --> 03:14:59.266]  We're not going to take casualties.
[03:14:59.266 --> 03:15:00.266]  We're not going to do this.
[03:15:00.266 --> 03:15:02.026]  And we're going to have to fight back.
[03:15:02.026 --> 03:15:02.486]  Exactly.
[03:15:02.486 --> 03:15:05.047]  We've already seen over 100 cops executed in the media celebrating.
[03:15:05.047 --> 03:15:06.607]  And it's not just about worshipping cops.
[03:15:06.607 --> 03:15:09.108]  But if they can kill innocent cops, they can kill anybody.
[03:15:10.109 --> 03:15:11.411]  Absolutely, oh yeah, yeah.
[03:15:11.411 --> 03:15:17.379]  I mean, for crying out loud, you kill a police officer, you're going to kill anyone.
[03:15:17.379 --> 03:15:19.842]  And if they can get away with that, they've set this...
[03:15:22.145 --> 03:15:24.806]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[03:15:24.806 --> 03:15:45.272]  This is so well organized, and I think the last thing I really wanted to mention is I think we cannot understate what we're seeing here, and we also have to really place responsibility where it belongs, and that is this shadow government that's operational by Obama, by the Obama holdovers.
[03:15:45.272 --> 03:15:46.712]  Which he admittedly dug in.
[03:15:46.712 --> 03:15:48.833]  He admittedly called it a shadow government.
[03:15:49.554 --> 03:15:50.915]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:50.915 --> 03:16:01.042]  And it goes back decades, but really under the Obama Organizing for Action, which is the fourth iteration of the plans, or the various groups, but these are the foot soldiers that we're seeing.
[03:16:01.042 --> 03:16:04.704]  Now we're seeing everything come to fruition that's been planned.
[03:16:04.704 --> 03:16:07.166]  And let's be clear, this is not a drill.
[03:16:07.166 --> 03:16:08.146]  They admit themselves.
[03:16:08.146 --> 03:16:10.428]  They intend to try it, which is crazy.
[03:16:10.428 --> 03:16:14.571]  Historically, I'm not saying this to sound positive, they have a 10% chance of succeeding, Doug.
[03:16:16.042 --> 03:16:24.308]  Yeah, I'd put the Patriots against this cannon fodder any day of the week.
[03:16:24.308 --> 03:16:32.015]  The problem is, what are our enemies like China and North Korea going to do when we are tied down in this?
[03:16:33.604 --> 03:16:34.765]  That's a great question.
[03:16:34.765 --> 03:16:37.667]  You know, I'm no expert in that department.
[03:16:37.667 --> 03:16:38.147]  I don't know.
[03:16:38.147 --> 03:16:38.948]  But I'll tell you something.
[03:16:38.948 --> 03:16:42.811]  We certainly don't need that division that they're causing.
[03:16:42.811 --> 03:16:46.333]  You talk about some potential for, you know, takeover.
[03:16:46.333 --> 03:16:51.096]  And make no mistake, who's directing the Democrats more and more is Red China.
[03:16:51.096 --> 03:16:52.477]  Yeah, very, very much so.
[03:16:52.477 --> 03:16:57.941]  And you see the Clinton relationship with the foreign entities.
[03:16:57.941 --> 03:16:58.362]  Yeah.
[03:16:58.362 --> 03:17:00.003]  I can't believe we put up with it this long.
[03:17:00.003 --> 03:17:01.284]  I mean, all these people should be
[03:17:03.308 --> 03:17:04.595]  This should be facing grand jury.
[03:17:04.595 --> 03:17:05.178]  I'll leave it at that.
[03:17:05.178 --> 03:17:06.123]  I mean, this is so ridiculous.
[03:17:07.823 --> 03:17:08.803]  We're all on the line here, folks.
[03:17:08.803 --> 03:17:09.323]  This is real.
[03:17:09.323 --> 03:17:13.724]  They've got ten TV shows attacking me right now, made-for-TV movies.
[03:17:13.724 --> 03:17:14.984]  They're all coming after us.
[03:17:14.984 --> 03:17:15.625]  This is real.
[03:17:15.625 --> 03:17:16.605]  And you know what?
[03:17:16.605 --> 03:17:17.085]  It's okay.
[03:17:17.085 --> 03:17:17.905]  We're in this.
[03:17:17.905 --> 03:17:18.525]  This is life.
[03:17:18.525 --> 03:17:23.286]  It wasn't going to be gravy train and shopping malls and movies and ball games forever, okay?
[03:17:23.286 --> 03:17:24.306]  This is the big push.
[03:17:24.306 --> 03:17:25.506]  This is the big attack.
[03:17:25.506 --> 03:17:26.686]  We beat this.
[03:17:26.686 --> 03:17:30.407]  We've got 50 years of prosperity after this and the new American century.
[03:17:30.407 --> 03:17:32.007]  But we get defeated in this.
[03:17:32.007 --> 03:17:33.308]  It is hell on earth.
[03:17:33.308 --> 03:17:34.648]  And I'm not worried about myself.
[03:17:34.648 --> 03:17:35.088]  I'm a man.
[03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:37.061]  I can take it.
[03:17:37.061 --> 03:17:38.162]  Let me tell you something.
[03:17:38.162 --> 03:17:38.743]  I don't mind it.
[03:17:38.743 --> 03:17:39.443]  I don't mind the pain.
[03:17:39.443 --> 03:17:41.426]  To quote Glenn Danzig, I really don't.
[03:17:42.912 --> 03:17:45.194]  But I really feel sorry for the kids and everybody else.
[03:17:45.194 --> 03:17:48.778]  So I'm just telling you, if we gotta do this right now, I'm not afraid of these people.
[03:17:48.778 --> 03:17:50.560]  I'm afraid I'm not gonna do a good enough job.
[03:17:50.560 --> 03:17:52.081]  Now, I'm gonna skip this break so we have more time.
[03:17:52.081 --> 03:17:52.702]  Go to Roger Stone.
[03:17:52.702 --> 03:17:58.407]  Here he is getting off a plane a few days ago, and TMZ yelling at him, saying, oh, you know, you're planning violence or whatever.
[03:17:58.407 --> 03:18:04.493]  And here he is, just saying, look, what do you think's gonna happen when you start a war and keep attacking us?
[03:18:04.493 --> 03:18:05.434]  This is what's gonna happen.
[03:18:05.434 --> 03:18:06.175]  They want a civil war.
[03:18:06.175 --> 03:18:06.856]  Here's Roger Stone.
[03:18:07.725 --> 03:18:10.627]  People are even calling for impeachment already and that sort of stuff.
[03:18:10.627 --> 03:18:12.708]  Do you think there's any chance that he might be impeached?
[03:18:12.708 --> 03:18:16.190]  The people who are calling for impeachment are the people who didn't vote for him.
[03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:17.731]  They need to get over it.
[03:18:17.731 --> 03:18:18.771]  They lost.
[03:18:18.771 --> 03:18:20.452]  Their candidate had every advantage.
[03:18:20.452 --> 03:18:22.653]  She spent $2 billion.
[03:18:22.653 --> 03:18:24.735]  He spent $275 billion.
[03:18:24.735 --> 03:18:25.235]  Sorry.
[03:18:25.235 --> 03:18:26.276]  He whipped her ass.
[03:18:26.276 --> 03:18:26.836]  It's over.
[03:18:26.836 --> 03:18:27.756]  You lost.
[03:18:27.756 --> 03:18:28.717]  Try to impeach him.
[03:18:28.717 --> 03:18:29.537]  Just try it.
[03:18:29.537 --> 03:18:34.580]  You will have a spasm of violence in this country, an insurrection like you've never seen.
[03:18:34.580 --> 03:18:35.341]  You think?
[03:18:35.341 --> 03:18:35.841]  No question.
[03:18:35.981 --> 03:18:40.084]  Do you think if he got impeached, the country would go to... Both sides are heavily armed, my friend.
[03:18:40.084 --> 03:18:41.765]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:18:41.765 --> 03:18:42.465]  This is not 1974.
[03:18:42.465 --> 03:18:47.029]  The people will not stand for impeachment.
[03:18:47.029 --> 03:18:51.231]  A politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life.
[03:18:51.231 --> 03:18:53.593]  There will be violence on both sides.
[03:18:53.593 --> 03:18:54.394]  I'll make this clear.
[03:18:54.394 --> 03:18:57.676]  I'm not advocating violence, but I'm predicting it.
[03:18:57.676 --> 03:19:03.180]  You're predicting that if he got impeached, there'd be some sort of civil war type... Yes, that's what I think will happen.
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:05.421]  Hell, that's what they've been pushing.
[03:19:05.421 --> 03:19:10.764]  And here's the thing, they want to train us to march out to face a bunch of toilet paper anti-fascists.
[03:19:10.764 --> 03:19:14.186]  If they're not killing people, they go kill cops?
[03:19:14.186 --> 03:19:18.048]  They go send folks to shoot members of Congress?
[03:19:18.048 --> 03:19:20.869]  They're killing cops and Congress people.
[03:19:20.869 --> 03:19:25.192]  I'm telling you, don't go out and fight dirty meth heads who aren't even worth killing.
[03:19:26.530 --> 03:19:31.592]  You let the leadership of the coup know, that's on TV saying they're gonna kill the president, that you know what?
[03:19:31.592 --> 03:19:33.572]  This is a two-way street, brother.
[03:19:33.572 --> 03:19:36.833]  And let them feel physics.
[03:19:36.833 --> 03:19:38.674]  Let them feel it.
[03:19:38.674 --> 03:19:41.335]  Let them know.
[03:19:41.335 --> 03:19:52.898]  Because once you let the dogs of war off the chain, they're gonna find America's restraint hadn't been weakness, hadn't been cowardice, it's been guilt at what incredible killers we are.
[03:19:52.898 --> 03:19:54.959]  How easy it is, how good we are at it.
[03:19:56.291 --> 03:19:59.194]  Your constituents can hardly walk.
[03:19:59.194 --> 03:20:00.115]  You have no idea.
[03:20:00.115 --> 03:20:03.678]  And I'm not trying to intimidate the enemy, because they're totally turned over to evil.
[03:20:03.678 --> 03:20:04.859]  They're not going to listen.
[03:20:04.859 --> 03:20:13.167]  I just want the listeners to know, if we go where they want to take us, let's give them what they came for in spades, in royal flush.
[03:20:17.475 --> 03:20:19.518]  Roger Stone, we stand at the precipice.
[03:20:19.518 --> 03:20:22.282]  The second Bolshevik Revolution is upon us in October.
[03:20:22.282 --> 03:20:24.446]  There's no doubt they're launching operations.
[03:20:24.446 --> 03:20:25.748]  Does the President know?
[03:20:25.748 --> 03:20:26.890]  What can we do, Roger Stone?
[03:20:28.820 --> 03:20:36.208]  Well, Alex, I must tell you, I got jostled on the street here in West Hollywood this morning.
[03:20:36.208 --> 03:20:38.270]  I guess this has become the way of the world.
[03:20:38.270 --> 03:20:45.518]  A citizen cannot even walk on the streets without being assaulted by hysterical leftists.
[03:20:45.518 --> 03:20:50.203]  It reflects everything you have not only said, but which you have predicted now for months.
[03:20:51.168 --> 03:20:54.309]  That this conflagration was coming.
[03:20:54.309 --> 03:20:55.450]  You remember election night?
[03:20:55.450 --> 03:20:56.010]  I'm not bragging.
[03:20:56.010 --> 03:20:57.271]  What did I tell you?
[03:20:57.271 --> 03:21:00.212]  No, you said that you were a little downcast.
[03:21:00.212 --> 03:21:09.896]  Not because we won, but because you foresaw the fact that the left would never accept the Democratic election, would never accept the result.
[03:21:09.896 --> 03:21:11.396]  I was preparing to die, Roger.
[03:21:11.396 --> 03:21:14.018]  I can see where we're going.
[03:21:14.018 --> 03:21:15.038]  But we're going to win in the end.
[03:21:15.038 --> 03:21:16.799]  But no, I was preparing to die that night.
[03:21:16.799 --> 03:21:17.299]  You understand now?
[03:21:18.089 --> 03:21:19.350]  Yes, indeed.
[03:21:19.350 --> 03:21:21.593]  I now see the big picture.
[03:21:21.593 --> 03:21:29.420]  I've never seen this kind of hysteria ever before on the political front, and they just keep ratcheting up.
[03:21:29.420 --> 03:21:36.507]  Their entire Russian gambit, which was designed to remove Trump, has failed, has fallen flat.
[03:21:36.507 --> 03:21:39.390]  Even this new email that was discovered
[03:21:40.807 --> 03:21:43.348]  Uh, in the email of Rick Dearborn.
[03:21:43.348 --> 03:21:49.391]  Oh my God, somebody on the transition team said sometime we're going to talk to Putin like you're going to talk to everybody!
[03:21:49.391 --> 03:21:52.852]  And they go, oh look, we caught him talking to the Japanese Prime Minister!
[03:21:52.852 --> 03:21:55.293]  Yeah, it's not even that serious.
[03:21:55.293 --> 03:22:04.897]  When you run a presidential campaign, you get thousands and thousands of incoming messages from well-meaning people who have no judgment.
[03:22:05.535 --> 03:22:19.818]  Whoever the person in West Virginia was who said, oh, the campaign staff should meet with Vladimir Putin, I mean, that's not only improbable, impossible, and highly unlikely, it's absurd!
[03:22:19.818 --> 03:22:22.998]  And by the way, there's no evidence that any such meeting ever happened.
[03:22:22.998 --> 03:22:25.519]  And how do we know the Democrats didn't send the email?
[03:22:25.519 --> 03:22:27.479]  It's not even a response, it's an email!
[03:22:27.479 --> 03:22:32.720]  They could send me an email saying I'm Captain Kangaroo, and say, oh look, Alex is talking to Captain Kangaroo!
[03:22:34.293 --> 03:22:37.997]  Yeah, but you see, again, the media's all over it today.
[03:22:37.997 --> 03:22:41.480]  The way they were over the Donald Trump Jr.
[03:22:41.480 --> 03:22:43.843]  meeting, as if it was something.
[03:22:43.843 --> 03:22:45.324]  They're running out of straws.
[03:22:45.324 --> 03:22:51.070]  They switched, therefore, from Russia, because that failed, to race.
[03:22:51.070 --> 03:22:56.616]  The race card and race baiting is kind of a surefire issue for the left.
[03:22:57.427 --> 03:23:02.251]  Going so far as to say anybody who voted for Donald Trump is a white supremacist.
[03:23:02.251 --> 03:23:05.754]  That's the most ridiculous thing I literally have ever heard.
[03:23:05.754 --> 03:23:06.714]  Absurd.
[03:23:06.714 --> 03:23:07.635]  Absolutely absurd.
[03:23:07.635 --> 03:23:10.818]  But clearly, I think Russia in all of it is a smoke screen for race war.
[03:23:10.818 --> 03:23:12.399]  They're going with this narrative.
[03:23:12.399 --> 03:23:14.080]  They're activating their cells.
[03:23:14.080 --> 03:23:15.641]  It's confirmed.
[03:23:15.641 --> 03:23:17.623]  Where do you think this is going?
[03:23:17.623 --> 03:23:21.506]  Well, when you have CNN and other news outlets
[03:23:22.366 --> 03:23:47.342]  Excusing the violence of the left saying because of the oppressive history of slavery That it's perfectly all right for some cops were bad all cops deserve to be killed exactly They're now calling for violence on CNN Roger It's extraordinary then the other thing I find interesting is it CNN actually has a promo to keep playing that says as the Trump presidency implodes
[03:23:48.217 --> 03:23:49.738]  Who said it's imploding?
[03:23:49.738 --> 03:23:54.459]  He's not going anywhere, other than continuing to do the job.
[03:23:54.459 --> 03:24:00.702]  Does CNN not know that their bosses are trying to entice loose cannon people to attack them?
[03:24:00.702 --> 03:24:04.623]  Don't attack folks, let them move, let them attack us first.
[03:24:04.623 --> 03:24:07.504]  We're winning intellectually, but they're the ones getting ready for violence.
[03:24:07.504 --> 03:24:11.406]  Doesn't the CNN employees realize they're being sucked into a civil war?
[03:24:12.537 --> 03:24:33.029]  Well, I think that they have sped up their timetable at CNN to call for anarchy because the handwriting's on the wall, and they know that Jeff Zucker will shortly be out, and that they will have new management that may not look as favorably on their revolutionary credo as the current management at CNN.
[03:24:33.029 --> 03:24:36.952]  That's why I think they have gone, you know, zero to 60 overnight.
[03:24:38.363 --> 03:24:42.106]  Yeah, they're trying to, it's like cockroaches when you poison them, they all start having sex.
[03:24:42.106 --> 03:24:48.631]  I always heard this, and one time I sprayed a bunch of roaches I found behind the refrigerator, and they all started having sex immediately when I sprayed them.
[03:24:48.631 --> 03:24:54.016]  It's like they know they're all done for, they're losing, so now they're trying to move the revolution forward.
[03:24:54.016 --> 03:24:56.238]  That makes perfect sense to me.
[03:24:56.238 --> 03:25:03.224]  I mean, the tone and the hysteria at CNN has now reached epic proportions, watching
[03:25:04.287 --> 03:25:07.309]  Anderson Cooper's show the other night with Ed Martin.
[03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:08.510]  Oh, it's just unreal.
[03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:10.191]  It's total foaming at the mouth.
[03:25:10.191 --> 03:25:11.532]  Five on one!
[03:25:11.532 --> 03:25:12.833]  I've never seen anything like it.
[03:25:12.833 --> 03:25:16.495]  By the way, I thought Martin handled himself pretty well under those circumstances.
[03:25:16.495 --> 03:25:18.556]  And I've seen him here on InfoWars many times.
[03:25:18.556 --> 03:25:20.778]  He's a solid, patriotic fellow.
[03:25:20.778 --> 03:25:24.000]  It took a lot of guts to go on five on one.
[03:25:24.960 --> 03:25:26.940]  Yeah, the guys wanted me to play that clip yesterday.
[03:25:26.940 --> 03:25:28.161]  It's very, very powerful.
[03:25:28.161 --> 03:25:29.621]  They all gang on.
[03:25:29.621 --> 03:25:33.222]  CNN says, quote, all Trump supporters are white supremacists.
[03:25:33.222 --> 03:25:34.622]  That is so dangerous.
[03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:35.962]  That is so wild.
[03:25:35.962 --> 03:25:41.883]  There's nowhere for them to go next when they've already had Phil Mudd saying, kill the president, we're going to kill him.
[03:25:41.883 --> 03:25:44.944]  He's a former deputy director of the CIA and FBI.
[03:25:44.944 --> 03:25:49.825]  I mean, why SWAT teams didn't take him for a kayaking trip the next morning?
[03:25:49.825 --> 03:25:50.785]  I mean, this is insane.
[03:25:51.502 --> 03:25:58.045]  Yeah, well, again, Jeff Sessions had the power to move against the Obama NSA clique.
[03:25:58.045 --> 03:26:07.871]  Those are the people orchestrating this revolution, this insurgency, specifically John Brennan, Admiral Rogers, James Clapper.
[03:26:07.871 --> 03:26:08.551]  How do you like this?
[03:26:10.772 --> 03:26:23.719]  Who got caught lying twice in front of the Congress about the government's metadata program, only to be proven to be a liar by Edward Snowden, he's now running around saying Donald Trump is unfit?
[03:26:23.719 --> 03:26:24.760]  No, dude!
[03:26:24.760 --> 03:26:26.521]  You're the one who's unfit!
[03:26:26.521 --> 03:26:29.202]  You're the one who belongs in a federal penitentiary!
[03:26:29.202 --> 03:26:30.663]  What are you talking about?
[03:26:30.663 --> 03:26:34.205]  And, Mr. Clapper, what's with the shaved head thing?
[03:26:34.205 --> 03:26:36.426]  Why do you guys all have shaved heads?
[03:26:36.426 --> 03:26:38.207]  Is this some kind of secret club or what?
[03:26:39.087 --> 03:26:42.508]  Well, let's expand on this.
[03:26:42.508 --> 03:26:43.968]  They're desperate.
[03:26:43.968 --> 03:26:45.429]  They're pathetic.
[03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:53.691]  But their constituents, everybody I know on their Uber bills, on power bills, on bank statements, there's like, there's KKK everywhere.
[03:26:53.691 --> 03:26:54.611]  Report Nazis.
[03:26:54.611 --> 03:26:56.012]  Attack them if you see them.
[03:26:56.012 --> 03:26:57.472]  The corporations are like,
[03:26:58.664 --> 03:26:59.924]  Oh, this is a revolution.
[03:26:59.924 --> 03:27:08.727]  All I'm telling you is they are now firing on all fronts, but it may just be a giant toddler event because none of them are willing to pull triggers like the Bolshevik Revolution.
[03:27:08.727 --> 03:27:13.389]  I mean, does this thing just fizzle or a few poor cops get shot in the back of the head or what happens?
[03:27:13.389 --> 03:27:14.749]  Well, I think we shall see.
[03:27:14.749 --> 03:27:20.191]  Their problem, of course, is that they are seeing ghosts where none exist.
[03:27:20.191 --> 03:27:23.993]  I've been active on the American right for 40 years.
[03:27:23.993 --> 03:27:25.173]  I've never met any Klansmen.
[03:27:25.999 --> 03:27:28.981]  I've never actually seen any white supremacists.
[03:27:28.981 --> 03:27:30.721]  I don't know any neo-Nazis.
[03:27:30.721 --> 03:27:32.822]  I think this is a handful of nuts.
[03:27:32.822 --> 03:27:34.543]  A handful of kooks.
[03:27:34.543 --> 03:27:35.684]  The idea that they're everywhere.
[03:27:35.684 --> 03:27:36.924]  No, they're nowhere.
[03:27:36.924 --> 03:27:42.827]  Now, what there are, however, is crazy left-wing radicals from Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
[03:27:42.827 --> 03:27:43.748]  There are plenty of them.
[03:27:43.748 --> 03:27:46.429]  They're so gutless, they have to wear masks.
[03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:48.870]  They won't even show their faces.
[03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:53.112]  That's because most of them, we've learned, their group got leaked.
[03:27:53.112 --> 03:27:54.413]  They're almost all school teachers.
[03:27:56.092 --> 03:28:08.137]  Well, what I find interesting is the fact that they don't recognize the American right's long adherence to the Second Amendment and the vast number of patriots who own firearms and know how to use them.
[03:28:08.137 --> 03:28:13.140]  This is why they've been trying to get guns away from patriots for so long.
[03:28:13.140 --> 03:28:15.841]  Again, I don't advocate violence.
[03:28:15.841 --> 03:28:17.462]  I renounce violence.
[03:28:17.462 --> 03:28:19.262]  I'm not condoning violence.
[03:28:19.262 --> 03:28:20.283]  I'm against violence.
[03:28:21.175 --> 03:28:23.136]  They like to twist your words.
[03:28:23.136 --> 03:28:30.857]  When you foresee what's happening, or what will happen, as I did on TMZ, well then it was, Stone calls for civil war.
[03:28:30.857 --> 03:28:32.738]  No, I call for nothing of the kind.
[03:28:32.738 --> 03:28:34.038]  Stone calls for violence.
[03:28:34.038 --> 03:28:35.399]  No, I never said that at all.
[03:28:35.399 --> 03:28:37.359]  Go listen to the whole interview.
[03:28:37.359 --> 03:28:48.682]  But they twist your words in an attempt to... All I'm doing is warning these people, you want to come kill me, and kill the President, and piss all over George Washington, you're going to get a fight, dumbass!
[03:28:50.126 --> 03:28:58.411]  George Washington freed his slaves, and he also made financial arrangements so they would all have an opportunity.
[03:28:58.411 --> 03:29:01.393]  He was a great man, father of our country.
[03:29:01.393 --> 03:29:05.015]  Now they want to tear down his portrait, tear down his statues?
[03:29:05.015 --> 03:29:05.556]  Ridiculous.
[03:29:06.810 --> 03:29:14.492]  He was born into all that and then reportedly most his wealth went to putting people into education and giving them money when he ended it.
[03:29:14.492 --> 03:29:16.773]  But it doesn't matter that the West ended slavery.
[03:29:16.773 --> 03:29:17.713]  They project the lie.
[03:29:17.713 --> 03:29:22.475]  I want to come back to Doug Hagman and get his take on this incredible breakdown of Roger Stone and also look at other attacks.
[03:29:22.475 --> 03:29:27.256]  It was Roger Stone predicted the whole Alzheimer's thing, the whole early onset dementia.
[03:29:27.256 --> 03:29:28.517]  Now that's there.
[03:29:28.517 --> 03:29:35.439]  And also we had Posobiec and others breaking that they've banned info wars at the White House in a desperate attempt to get the president away.
[03:29:35.439 --> 03:29:36.439]  That was confirmed yesterday.
[03:29:36.459 --> 03:29:36.919]  Yesterday.
[03:29:36.919 --> 03:29:37.519]  Stay with us.
[03:29:37.519 --> 03:29:38.900]  We're on the march.
[03:29:38.900 --> 03:29:41.421]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:41.421 --> 03:29:49.923]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:49.923 --> 03:29:54.625]  You deserve a deep, restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[03:30:45.296 --> 03:30:46.737]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:30:49.099 --> 03:30:50.980]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:50.980 --> 03:30:53.001]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:53.001 --> 03:30:55.902]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:55.902 --> 03:31:01.965]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:01.965 --> 03:31:11.169]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:11.169 --> 03:31:14.450]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:18.696]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:18.696 --> 03:31:26.727]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:26.727 --> 03:31:27.809]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:28.900 --> 03:31:32.845]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:32.845 --> 03:31:36.409]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:36.409 --> 03:31:43.118]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:43.118 --> 03:31:47.323]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4wrestore.com.
[03:31:49.474 --> 03:31:54.199]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:31:54.199 --> 03:32:04.630]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[03:32:04.650 --> 03:32:13.892]  Infowars had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:32:13.892 --> 03:32:27.896]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:32:27.896 --> 03:32:30.257]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:32:30.257 --> 03:32:33.938]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the
[03:32:34.258 --> 03:32:34.698]  We're good.
[03:33:06.286 --> 03:33:08.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.247 --> 03:33:11.108]  We're into the fourth hour with Roger Stone.
[03:33:11.108 --> 03:33:14.369]  And of course, Doug Hagman of Hagman & Hagman.
[03:33:14.369 --> 03:33:17.370]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[03:33:17.370 --> 03:33:21.031]  With Hurricane Harvey about to bash into Texas.
[03:33:21.031 --> 03:33:23.072]  Similar hurricanes have killed hundreds of people.
[03:33:23.072 --> 03:33:25.193]  And this one, they say, has got even more water in it.
[03:33:25.193 --> 03:33:27.233]  Up to 40 inches of rain.
[03:33:27.233 --> 03:33:31.135]  And Austin, where I live, will have power outages, probably have some serious issues.
[03:33:31.135 --> 03:33:33.695]  So, we'll have live feeds here from Austin.
[03:33:33.695 --> 03:33:34.616]  It was Owen Schroer!
[03:33:35.376 --> 03:33:35.596]  I think so.
[03:33:52.641 --> 03:33:53.582]  I don't think so.
[03:34:09.704 --> 03:34:11.925]  Poor Gwyneth Paltrow.
[03:34:11.925 --> 03:34:19.086]  I saw months ago, and they put her on all the big comedy shows, TV shows, saying, look, the left wing has their kooks that sell supplements, and so does Alex Jones.
[03:34:19.086 --> 03:34:26.528]  They didn't say, Jeff Bezos does, and he owns Amazon, he owns Whole Foods, and Alex private labels a lot of the stuff that's sold at Whole Foods.
[03:34:26.528 --> 03:34:31.069]  No, it was like, Alex Jones is evil, selling melatonin for sleep and vitamin C for health.
[03:34:31.069 --> 03:34:33.950]  Alex Jones is evil and says vitamin B12 is good for her.
[03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:36.291]  He's a complete lying scumbag, racist KKK member.
[03:34:36.291 --> 03:34:37.771]  I mean, literally, that's what they said.
[03:34:38.812 --> 03:34:47.585]  And I said, look, they're going to have some watchdog group file complaints and ask district attorneys or others or state attorney generals to indict Gwyneth Paltrow.
[03:34:47.585 --> 03:34:49.648]  And I said this months ago, I said they're going to indict her.
[03:34:51.283 --> 03:34:54.925]  First, and then go, see, we weren't picking on right-wingers.
[03:34:54.925 --> 03:34:56.567]  We indicted one of the Paltrow.
[03:34:56.567 --> 03:34:58.428]  Now, I didn't just know about this.
[03:34:58.428 --> 03:35:09.715]  Before they picked Paltrow, people were at meetings in D.C., New York, and other areas with the lawyers, where they had this whole strategy, and they said, well, they're going to burn some leftists for the supplements, and then Alex Jones.
[03:35:09.715 --> 03:35:11.396]  So, I knew when I saw it.
[03:35:11.396 --> 03:35:13.938]  So, do it!
[03:35:14.921 --> 03:35:20.283]  It will blow up in your face bigger than Dallas, and that is some confidence game here.
[03:35:20.283 --> 03:35:21.744]  I mean, you're dead threats.
[03:35:21.744 --> 03:35:23.725]  What you've done to my family, you know what you've done.
[03:35:23.725 --> 03:35:26.106]  You know I'm not backing off.
[03:35:26.106 --> 03:35:27.527]  Go ahead, do what you're going to do.
[03:35:27.527 --> 03:35:31.769]  I kind of metaphysically, though, need to just tell you, it's probably not going to go too well.
[03:35:31.769 --> 03:35:40.813]  As long as our supporters pray for us, spread the articles and the videos organically, knowing that can't be blocked by the censors, and as long as they buy the products.
[03:35:41.773 --> 03:35:43.074]  We have super male vitality.
[03:35:43.074 --> 03:35:48.536]  There's just no concentrated herbs and compounds that healthfully have been associated.
[03:35:48.536 --> 03:35:49.937]  And I certainly have experienced it.
[03:35:49.937 --> 03:35:57.641]  Better stamina, libido, you name it.
[03:35:57.641 --> 03:36:03.183]  And it is just absolutely essential that everybody support the transmission.
[03:36:03.183 --> 03:36:04.504]  So super male vitality is 57% off.
[03:36:07.734 --> 03:36:08.794]  57% off.
[03:36:08.794 --> 03:36:10.336]  Never done a special that big.
[03:36:10.336 --> 03:36:11.316]  Can't do Super Female.
[03:36:11.316 --> 03:36:12.297]  It's about to sell out.
[03:36:12.297 --> 03:36:14.038]  We have the great BioTrue Selenium.
[03:36:14.038 --> 03:36:15.059]  It's from mustard seed.
[03:36:15.059 --> 03:36:16.040]  Without selenium, you die.
[03:36:16.040 --> 03:36:17.541]  Doesn't mean my selenium.
[03:36:17.541 --> 03:36:19.042]  Selenium's like oxygen.
[03:36:19.042 --> 03:36:20.603]  I can say, you gotta have oxygen to live.
[03:36:20.603 --> 03:36:22.205]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:36:22.205 --> 03:36:25.948]  Survival Shield X2, highest quality, purest iodine we can develop and bring to you.
[03:36:25.948 --> 03:36:27.949]  Those are 45% off.
[03:36:27.949 --> 03:36:29.730]  That is an amazing deal as well.
[03:36:29.730 --> 03:36:32.352]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.
[03:36:34.574 --> 03:36:38.476]  And I don't say get water filters for floods or earthquakes or whatever.
[03:36:38.476 --> 03:36:43.299]  I filter my water because it's filled with hundreds of chemicals from tap water or the average well water.
[03:36:43.299 --> 03:36:46.441]  I filter it through ProPure and AlexaPure because they're high quality.
[03:36:46.441 --> 03:36:50.244]  Those are available at the lowest prices you'll find at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:36:50.244 --> 03:36:54.066]  And when you get products you need and then fund us, it's Symbiotic.
[03:36:54.066 --> 03:36:56.167]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:36:59.389 --> 03:37:03.090]  Doug Hagman's our guest, riding shotgun with Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:37:03.090 --> 03:37:04.731]  Roger now officially works with them fours.
[03:37:04.731 --> 03:37:07.412]  In one week, his new show, 3 p.m.
[03:37:07.412 --> 03:37:11.413]  Central Every Day, kicks off with Mike Cernovich, Owen Schroyer, and others.
[03:37:11.413 --> 03:37:16.075]  I'm trying to get Owen on at the very end, even though he's like an hour and a half away from the coast, and I understand that.
[03:37:16.075 --> 03:37:17.916]  I want him on his way down to the coast.
[03:37:18.756 --> 03:37:22.577]  So we'll get him driving while they do that on a live Skype feed.
[03:37:22.577 --> 03:37:26.238]  Or as soon as they get to a small enough town to be able to get a feed.
[03:37:26.238 --> 03:37:27.838]  A bunch of small towns on the way down.
[03:37:27.838 --> 03:37:30.999]  I hope they took 37 because I can't direct stuff up here while I was on air.
[03:37:30.999 --> 03:37:31.559]  That's the road.
[03:37:31.559 --> 03:37:36.341]  I hope they're not going like over to 45 then down they'll be there tomorrow.
[03:37:36.341 --> 03:37:39.101]  But we'll see exactly what was done around here strategy wise.
[03:37:39.101 --> 03:37:40.182]  I'm not bitching.
[03:37:40.182 --> 03:37:42.862]  We just seat of our pants around here in this fight.
[03:37:45.183 --> 03:37:49.265]  Going back to Doug Hagman about other points on this front, and then to Roger Stone.
[03:37:49.265 --> 03:37:51.586]  Doug Hagman.
[03:37:51.586 --> 03:37:52.406]  Alex, thanks.
[03:37:52.406 --> 03:38:07.753]  And you know, I was enjoying the conversation between you and Mr. Stone, and I thought, as I was listening to that, I recalled Mr. Stone talking about Donald Trump's execution by Robert Mueller, and of course, how Donald Trump is being isolated.
[03:38:07.753 --> 03:38:13.156]  And I think everything that I spoke about with respect to the various fascist groups
[03:38:13.696 --> 03:38:17.258]  That are at the street level and above.
[03:38:17.258 --> 03:38:20.079]  Kind of remember what Van Jones said.
[03:38:20.079 --> 03:38:22.120]  Top down, bottom up.
[03:38:22.120 --> 03:38:23.681]  Bottom up, top down, whatever.
[03:38:23.681 --> 03:38:25.662]  And I think that's what we're seeing take place right now.
[03:38:25.662 --> 03:38:28.404]  So this Spencer movement as you refer to it.
[03:38:28.404 --> 03:38:34.086]  But with respect to the top down, which Mr. Stone had mentioned about the execution by Mueller.
[03:38:34.086 --> 03:38:36.768]  I think that it's important for people to realize
[03:38:37.308 --> 03:38:57.757]  That Mueller, number one, is not qualified, of course, to be in that independent counsel position based on, I think it's 18 CFR 45.2 or one of those, the fact that he's got political and personal relationships with the principal, so he can't be a prosecutor and a witness at the same time.
[03:38:58.457 --> 03:39:00.700]  But, of course, exceptions are made.
[03:39:00.700 --> 03:39:03.424]  And the grand jury with respect to... Let me ask you this.
[03:39:03.424 --> 03:39:05.386]  It's a swamp grand jury.
[03:39:05.386 --> 03:39:06.468]  That has no credibility.
[03:39:06.468 --> 03:39:10.853]  You've got 99.8% of the donations going to Democrats.
[03:39:10.853 --> 03:39:12.676]  You've got them ignoring all the stuff the Democrats did.
[03:39:12.676 --> 03:39:15.279]  You've got almost all their people being Democrats.
[03:39:15.279 --> 03:39:15.719]  You've got...
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:18.523]  Comey caught lying to Congress.
[03:39:18.523 --> 03:39:20.626]  Notice they're kind of backing off the Russian narrative.
[03:39:20.626 --> 03:39:22.429]  What's your intel on that right now?
[03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:29.900]  I mean, it seems like they're kind of realizing even their fraud claims Trump uses outside accounting firms and it's super clean.
[03:39:29.900 --> 03:39:31.182]  It seems like that's hitting a dead end.
[03:39:32.219 --> 03:39:44.046]  Well, and that's interesting how that Russian narrative is seemingly dissolving, and I think what they're trying to do is breathe new life into that Russian narrative by attempting to flip Paul Manafort.
[03:39:44.046 --> 03:39:47.768]  Look, I don't have a good sense on that.
[03:39:47.768 --> 03:39:48.869]  However, I don't believe
[03:39:50.069 --> 03:39:51.410]  That's going to happen.
[03:39:51.410 --> 03:39:56.852]  I think that perhaps new life will be breathed into the Russian narrative.
[03:39:56.852 --> 03:39:59.233]  Or at least that's what they want to have happen.
[03:39:59.233 --> 03:40:01.254]  So let me bring him up and jump in any time.
[03:40:01.254 --> 03:40:03.815]  Roger used to be business partners with Paul Manafort.
[03:40:03.815 --> 03:40:04.655]  Great patriot.
[03:40:04.655 --> 03:40:06.096]  Worked with groups against Russia.
[03:40:06.096 --> 03:40:08.297]  All these claims are asinine.
[03:40:08.297 --> 03:40:12.419]  But they are trying to flip Manafort on SWAT team raids on stuff he already gave them.
[03:40:12.419 --> 03:40:13.059]  Where is that going?
[03:40:14.890 --> 03:40:17.012]  I think it's going precisely nowhere.
[03:40:17.012 --> 03:40:19.153]  I spoke to Paul roughly a week ago.
[03:40:19.153 --> 03:40:23.857]  He's very angry and continues to be defiant.
[03:40:23.857 --> 03:40:28.060]  The truth of it is, they want him to bear false witness against the President.
[03:40:28.060 --> 03:40:33.805]  They want him to say, yes, I was colluding with the Russians, and yes, Donald Trump knew everything.
[03:40:33.805 --> 03:40:36.427]  So they want him to become Judas Iscariot?
[03:40:36.954 --> 03:40:39.776]  They want him to become John Dean, and he's not going to do it.
[03:40:39.776 --> 03:40:42.458]  He's not going to lie.
[03:40:42.458 --> 03:40:46.741]  Therefore, they're trying to dredge up any pressure point on him they can find.
[03:40:46.741 --> 03:40:55.787]  The irony of this Nazi-like, Gestapo raid on his home, where they kick in the door, then they kick in the door to the bedroom where he's sleeping with his wife.
[03:40:57.149 --> 03:40:58.309]  And we're all the same.
[03:41:20.740 --> 03:41:21.601]  Shooting range here.
[03:41:21.601 --> 03:41:28.925]  It's just like, because we're not just loyal to Trump, we're loyal to America and we don't stand with the pedophile armies of Hillary Clinton.
[03:41:28.925 --> 03:41:31.907]  Well, not only that, but Alex, I saw something extraordinary today.
[03:41:31.907 --> 03:41:35.129]  I just hung up with a Politico reporter.
[03:41:35.129 --> 03:41:49.518]  Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic advisor, a former alum of Goldman Sachs, liberal Democrat, recommended for his job by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.
[03:41:50.285 --> 03:41:51.165]  I know, I saw that.
[03:41:51.165 --> 03:41:51.585]  What the hell?
[03:41:51.585 --> 03:41:52.105]  Well, no kidding!
[03:41:52.105 --> 03:41:55.686]  If I hear one of my employees... Hold on, Roger.
[03:41:55.686 --> 03:41:58.366]  If I hear one of my employees talking trash, they're fired!
[03:41:58.366 --> 03:42:00.347]  That's what... You don't do that!
[03:42:19.454 --> 03:42:21.715]  It's unprofessional as well as disloyal.
[03:42:21.715 --> 03:42:25.537]  If you've got a problem, then you come internally.
[03:42:25.537 --> 03:42:26.817]  Plus, that's like a leak.
[03:42:26.817 --> 03:42:29.718]  That's a form of a leak.
[03:42:29.718 --> 03:42:31.259]  That's the form of a leak, though.
[03:42:31.259 --> 03:42:37.341]  They want to shut the patriots off to Trump and support him so they can run around and he doesn't know they're undermining him.
[03:42:37.341 --> 03:42:38.362]  What a little piece of crap.
[03:42:38.362 --> 03:42:38.742]  What do we do?
[03:42:39.673 --> 03:42:42.796]  This guy should be fired so fast his head would spin.
[03:42:42.796 --> 03:42:49.441]  I mean, it's extraordinary to me that he's trying to feather his own nest here.
[03:42:49.441 --> 03:43:01.150]  He's joined the chorus of anti-Trump rhetoric when he's a White House insider, but he's been bestowed one of the greatest honors you could have in public services to serve on the White House staff.
[03:43:01.150 --> 03:43:06.375]  But I guess the lesson of this story is, when you go to bed with dogs, you wake up with fleas.
[03:43:07.586 --> 03:43:14.251]  Why would anybody in the Trump White House want to employ a liberal Democrat?
[03:43:14.251 --> 03:43:19.435]  They call him Carbon Tax Gary, because that's what he did at Goldman.
[03:43:19.435 --> 03:43:22.577]  Why would you ever bring him into the White House to begin with?
[03:43:22.577 --> 03:43:24.078]  Because he's obviously against Trump.
[03:43:24.078 --> 03:43:24.819]  Trump killed that.
[03:43:25.379 --> 03:43:28.761]  Multi-hundred trillion dollar deal they plan to the next few decades.
[03:43:28.761 --> 03:43:33.143]  Gary Cohn, Trump's advisor, said to have drafted a resignation letter after Charlottesville.
[03:43:33.143 --> 03:43:34.564]  Well, then let them leave!
[03:43:34.564 --> 03:43:36.605]  Good God, Trump's not a racist!
[03:43:36.605 --> 03:43:39.646]  I mean, just let this little leftist turdbag leave!
[03:43:39.646 --> 03:43:41.127]  God, we're sick of these parasites!
[03:43:41.727 --> 03:43:44.468]  Stay there, Roger Stone, stay there.
[03:43:44.468 --> 03:43:50.511]  Obviously, Mr. Doug Hagman, let's go now via Skype, driving down halfway to the Texas coast.
[03:43:50.511 --> 03:43:53.932]  Owen Schroyer, to cover the big lines of cars is what I want.
[03:43:53.932 --> 03:43:56.113]  The evacuation zone, once you get there.
[03:43:56.113 --> 03:43:57.894]  I want to get the stores that are all empty.
[03:43:57.894 --> 03:44:01.596]  I obviously want to get the storm surge, but it's about civilization on the edge.
[03:44:02.396 --> 03:44:08.519]  Well, we're almost to San Antonio right now, then we're going to hop on the 37, which is apparently where a lot of this traffic is.
[03:44:08.519 --> 03:44:10.319]  It's the main evacuation zone.
[03:44:10.319 --> 03:44:11.340]  37 is the main evacuation zone.
[03:44:27.520 --> 03:44:41.525]  Yeah, so we're heading towards 37 right now, and then we're going to head into the belly of Hurricane Harvey, and we're going to see what people are doing, if people are really evacuating like they've been told, if people are hunkering down.
[03:44:41.525 --> 03:44:43.806]  People we already know are raiding the spurs.
[03:44:43.806 --> 03:44:44.706]  So we're going to see all that.
[03:44:44.706 --> 03:44:48.327]  We'll see if we can see the FEMA response, whether it be good or bad.
[03:44:48.327 --> 03:44:50.928]  I know that President Trump has been really preparing for this.
[03:44:50.928 --> 03:44:55.150]  I can't remember during Hurricane Sandy or Hurricane Katrina
[03:44:56.087 --> 03:45:08.637]  Maybe you can remember this, but I don't remember any other president doing as much action prior to the actual hurricane, prior to the devastation that the weather is going to bring that President Trump has been drawing attention to.
[03:45:08.637 --> 03:45:10.138]  I've never seen that before in the past.
[03:45:10.138 --> 03:45:11.059]  Obama didn't really do it.
[03:45:11.059 --> 03:45:12.460]  I don't think Bush did it.
[03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:15.783]  You can see what happened with Sandy and Katrina just for proof of that.
[03:45:15.783 --> 03:45:19.666]  And by the way, Obama did nothing for Hurricane Sandy.
[03:45:19.666 --> 03:45:21.007]  But that was okay.
[03:45:21.007 --> 03:45:23.389]  But Trump hasn't done enough, even though it hasn't hit yet.
[03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:24.410]  That's the new talking point.
[03:45:26.215 --> 03:45:33.038]  Yeah, so we'll see what the response is like from FEMA, if they really need to get involved, if it's that devastating.
[03:45:33.038 --> 03:45:34.879]  Oh, they're going to need to get involved, dude.
[03:45:34.879 --> 03:45:38.240]  Dude, that is a fast-moving big hurricane.
[03:45:38.240 --> 03:45:39.741]  Three inches puts Houston underwater.
[03:45:39.741 --> 03:45:41.521]  We're talking 35, 40 inches.
[03:45:41.521 --> 03:45:43.102]  This is going to be a disaster.
[03:45:44.824 --> 03:45:53.970]  You know, and to the point that you were saying earlier, if you live in downtown Austin and there was some sort of a big event and you had to get out of the city, good luck!
[03:45:53.970 --> 03:45:58.453]  You're not going anywhere because they have you bottlenecked onto three bridges.
[03:45:58.453 --> 03:46:00.935]  There's only three bridges you can get over the water with.
[03:46:00.935 --> 03:46:11.462]  So, you know, this is the type of thing that makes people realize how fragile society really can be in the midst of a big event, especially when you're in a big city like Austin and people try to get out.
[03:46:11.462 --> 03:46:12.583]  You're not going anywhere, buddy.
[03:46:12.583 --> 03:46:13.083]  You're stuck.
[03:46:13.083 --> 03:46:14.004]  You better be prepared.
[03:46:14.406 --> 03:46:19.228]  And you know, I said this the other day, Alex, and this is sad, but I think it's true.
[03:46:19.228 --> 03:46:23.349]  I think that we are going to see some serious devastation from this hurricane.
[03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:25.810]  I think it's going to hit Corpus Christi hard tonight.
[03:46:25.810 --> 03:46:28.051]  I think it's going to hit Houston hard tomorrow.
[03:46:28.051 --> 03:46:32.172]  And then I think it's going to hit Louisiana hard on Sunday.
[03:46:32.172 --> 03:46:34.733]  Exactly, despite the fact we say this and I get it too.
[03:46:35.353 --> 03:46:42.219]  Because you don't believe it and all of a sudden the little streams in Austin, we're not even by the coast, go up and it's barely rushing, suddenly it is rushing.
[03:46:42.219 --> 03:46:44.281]  Don't drive across streams.
[03:46:44.281 --> 03:46:45.582]  Stay in your house.
[03:46:45.582 --> 03:46:46.843]  Get to high ground.
[03:46:46.843 --> 03:46:48.184]  Hundreds are going to die.
[03:46:48.184 --> 03:46:49.665]  If people don't listen, thousands are.
[03:46:49.665 --> 03:46:50.906]  Hundreds die each time.
[03:46:50.906 --> 03:46:57.032]  This is a big, fat storm, full of water, dumping, they're saying, minutes, inches a minute.
[03:46:57.472 --> 03:47:04.879]  And so, this is going to hit Texas hard, and we need to pray for folks, but people need to get to high ground, and they do need to evacuate.
[03:47:04.879 --> 03:47:14.268]  In fact, I told you guys this morning, I didn't know who was going to go, I just said, pick a hotel 50 miles from the coast, don't be down there low in that area, do whatever you want.
[03:47:14.268 --> 03:47:16.330]  You're driving along in my Ford truck, it looks pretty slick doesn't it?
[03:47:16.330 --> 03:47:18.312]  I've had that truck for like 7 years, it's an awesome truck.
[03:47:18.752 --> 03:47:27.355]  The point is, is that you need to be there, be safe, just show the stores, show the people, do the reports live in the stores at night, show the folks, but be safe.
[03:47:27.355 --> 03:47:28.655]  Okay, Owen?
[03:47:28.655 --> 03:47:30.936]  Well, Info News is going to have the coverage of this, Alex.
[03:47:30.936 --> 03:47:32.016]  We're going to be boots on the ground.
[03:47:32.016 --> 03:47:32.776]  We're going to be fearless.
[03:47:32.776 --> 03:47:35.377]  We're going to do exactly what our audience expects from us.
[03:47:35.377 --> 03:47:38.658]  But just on a closing note, I do agree with you.
[03:47:38.658 --> 03:47:40.699]  I think there's going to be some serious devastation with this.
[03:47:41.969 --> 03:47:46.294]  Sadly, I think that this can be used as a good time for America to unify.
[03:47:46.294 --> 03:47:50.159]  You know, to remember that we're all one country, we're all together in this.
[03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:54.042]  And when one of us suffers, as Trump has said, we all suffer.
[03:47:54.042 --> 03:47:58.745]  So this is going to be big for America to come together, to not let this hurricane... That's my next point.
[03:47:58.745 --> 03:48:00.166]  Did you know liberals everywhere?
[03:48:00.166 --> 03:48:02.288]  I saw this from Paul earlier and I couldn't believe it.
[03:48:02.288 --> 03:48:03.488]  I just searched it.
[03:48:03.488 --> 03:48:08.952]  Tens of thousands of tweets saying kill Texas, kill Florida, kill Louisiana.
[03:48:08.952 --> 03:48:10.753]  They deserve it because they're Republican.
[03:48:10.753 --> 03:48:12.554]  A third of the people are more Democrat.
[03:48:12.554 --> 03:48:13.835]  They are so crazy.
[03:48:13.835 --> 03:48:18.358]  They want everybody to die, the Democrats do, because Texas is Republican.
[03:48:18.358 --> 03:48:19.299]  What the hell?
[03:48:20.902 --> 03:48:24.384]  Well, I think that America is going to come together after this.
[03:48:24.384 --> 03:48:27.266]  I think people are going to come to help the devastation.
[03:48:27.266 --> 03:48:29.527]  And I think Trump's going to come to Texas.
[03:48:29.527 --> 03:48:30.748]  And I think so too.
[03:48:30.748 --> 03:48:35.051]  And I think this will be, even though a devastating sad moment, also a healing moment.
[03:48:35.051 --> 03:48:36.611]  Alex, we just went under a bridge.
[03:48:36.611 --> 03:48:41.234]  There was a digital sign on top of it that said, warning, do not travel south.
[03:48:41.234 --> 03:48:42.195]  Well, we're heading south.
[03:48:43.004 --> 03:48:46.627]  I'll take that camera right out the front of that Ford Raptor they're driving.
[03:48:46.627 --> 03:48:53.411]  The great American, big old giant vehicle that Al Gore actually owns one of, but he thinks you shouldn't be able to have one of.
[03:48:53.411 --> 03:48:54.652]  There we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:48:54.652 --> 03:48:57.614]  We're in the Ford Raptor.
[03:48:57.614 --> 03:48:59.576]  And hey, show me your crew member, who you got with you.
[03:48:59.576 --> 03:49:01.157]  Go ahead and show folks.
[03:49:01.157 --> 03:49:02.017]  There's Harrison.
[03:49:02.017 --> 03:49:03.538]  Harrison is a great patriot.
[03:49:03.538 --> 03:49:04.299]  Let's talk to Harrison.
[03:49:04.299 --> 03:49:05.580]  I know he's driving it real quick.
[03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:07.001]  Harrison, give us your take on things.
[03:49:09.090 --> 03:49:10.173]  I gotta agree with Owen.
[03:49:10.173 --> 03:49:12.480]  You know, I lived through a couple hurricanes in Houston.
[03:49:12.480 --> 03:49:13.784]  I grew up in Houston.
[03:49:13.784 --> 03:49:16.291]  And I knew, I mean, after the hurricane hit...
[03:49:16.801 --> 03:49:20.043]  I've never seen a neighborhood come together, like, after a hurricane hit.
[03:49:20.043 --> 03:49:21.865]  I mean, neighbors just getting together.
[03:49:21.865 --> 03:49:25.407]  If you got a big truck, you go drive through the water, you see if anybody needs help.
[03:49:25.407 --> 03:49:26.488]  Everybody's powered out.
[03:49:26.488 --> 03:49:34.253]  Everybody's just sitting out on the front porch and cooking out, and, uh, obviously you can't keep any of your food, so you're just—it just becomes a big block party.
[03:49:34.253 --> 03:49:40.197]  So, there is sort of this silver lining to the crowd when there is devastation like this.
[03:49:40.197 --> 03:49:44.180]  All those normal, little, you know, uh, neighborly, uh,
[03:49:44.690 --> 03:49:47.252]  You know, fights that you get in and all that, it all just falls to the wayside.
[03:49:47.252 --> 03:49:49.574]  Nobody comes together to help each other.
[03:49:49.574 --> 03:49:53.297]  So, I'm hoping we get some good footage of that as well.
[03:49:53.297 --> 03:49:54.237]  Well said, my friend.
[03:49:54.237 --> 03:49:55.498]  What a great crew member.
[03:49:55.498 --> 03:49:56.759]  A lot of great videos he's put out.
[03:49:56.759 --> 03:50:00.642]  Let's aim that he did Trump's first six months videos that show all the accomplishments.
[03:50:00.642 --> 03:50:02.464]  Let's aim that camera real quick for TV viewers.
[03:50:02.464 --> 03:50:04.105]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:50:04.105 --> 03:50:08.648]  I'm going to skip this break so folks can see as you barrel towards the old hurricane.
[03:50:08.648 --> 03:50:08.949]  Here we go.
[03:50:10.319 --> 03:50:11.239]  Get out in front of the car.
[03:50:11.239 --> 03:50:12.440]  Here we go, folks.
[03:50:12.440 --> 03:50:13.980]  Barreling down the highway towards it.
[03:50:13.980 --> 03:50:15.180]  Be safe, guys.
[03:50:15.180 --> 03:50:19.161]  Listeners, please pray for Harrison and for Owen.
[03:50:19.161 --> 03:50:19.981]  God bless you guys.
[03:50:19.981 --> 03:50:21.722]  Be safe.
[03:50:21.722 --> 03:50:23.842]  Alright, there you go.
[03:50:23.842 --> 03:50:25.003]  We're going to skip this break.
[03:50:25.003 --> 03:50:27.243]  Back to Roger Stone for closing comments.
[03:50:27.243 --> 03:50:31.864]  Then closing comments from Mr. Hagman.
[03:50:31.864 --> 03:50:35.665]  I cannot express to listeners enough that we're committed to this fight.
[03:50:35.665 --> 03:50:36.826]  And it's not because we're heroes.
[03:50:36.826 --> 03:50:37.426]  We're not slaves.
[03:50:38.345 --> 03:50:40.926]  Well, you called it Alex.
[03:50:40.926 --> 03:50:44.507]  I must admit this has happened much faster than I thought it would.
[03:50:44.507 --> 03:50:45.708]  I thought that ultimately the
[03:50:56.448 --> 03:51:02.592]  Left would settle down, particularly as Donald Trump moves the country towards prosperity.
[03:51:02.592 --> 03:51:14.740]  But instead, what we seem to have on our hands is a violent revolution, a violent overthrow of the constitutionally elected government, with half of the media defending it or promoting it.
[03:51:15.937 --> 03:51:21.238]  Uh, it is, uh, all my predictions on TMZ, I stand by.
[03:51:21.238 --> 03:51:24.239]  You are going to have a bloody civil war.
[03:51:24.239 --> 03:51:25.539]  We're not advocating it.
[03:51:25.539 --> 03:51:26.859]  We don't condone it.
[03:51:26.859 --> 03:51:28.260]  We're not for it.
[03:51:28.260 --> 03:51:31.000]  But it's not, we are not the ones provoking it.
[03:51:31.000 --> 03:51:31.520]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:34.321]  We're not going to take it once they swing.
[03:51:34.321 --> 03:51:35.601]  Why would we?
[03:51:35.601 --> 03:51:40.722]  I mean, I think we're the ones committed to a democratic constitutional system.
[03:51:40.722 --> 03:51:42.422]  And notice we're winning that way.
[03:51:42.422 --> 03:51:43.583]  We're winning.
[03:51:43.583 --> 03:51:44.583]  We're winning that way.
[03:51:45.490 --> 03:51:50.513]  Well, you know, I got contacted by some high-powered lawyers.
[03:51:50.513 --> 03:51:51.554]  They're my lawyers.
[03:52:03.604 --> 03:52:09.350]  And they said, yeah, they're going to indict a Hollywood person that promotes supplements to make it look like they're not going after you.
[03:52:09.350 --> 03:52:11.012]  And they even did it like a month later.
[03:52:11.012 --> 03:52:13.555]  Gwyneth Paltrow, Alex Jones, sold supplements to arrest him.
[03:52:13.555 --> 03:52:19.922]  Now they've got the indictments in California to put her in jail for selling mainline supplements that everybody else does.
[03:52:20.996 --> 03:52:22.676]  So they go, oh, we got Paltrow.
[03:52:22.676 --> 03:52:23.957]  Like, we don't know.
[03:52:23.957 --> 03:52:26.017]  Don't they get, like, it's going to come out?
[03:52:26.017 --> 03:52:27.557]  They don't understand.
[03:52:27.557 --> 03:52:32.818]  This isn't like we're blind, like their poor average constituent they're selling crack to.
[03:52:32.818 --> 03:52:33.819]  We are awake.
[03:52:33.819 --> 03:52:34.499]  We are ready.
[03:52:34.499 --> 03:52:37.179]  We're going to win, Roger.
[03:52:37.179 --> 03:52:50.522]  Well, I've just been told that some radical left-wing group has filed a complaint against me with the FBI, claiming that I have threatened members of Congress
[03:52:51.534 --> 03:52:58.578]  When I said that, in my opinion, no member of Congress who voted for impeachment would be safe.
[03:52:58.578 --> 03:53:06.163]  When I said that they would be taking their lives in their own hands, my lawyers will handle this.
[03:53:06.163 --> 03:53:09.665]  Filing a false complaint with the FBI is, of course,
[03:53:10.405 --> 03:53:10.845]  A crime.
[03:53:10.845 --> 03:53:17.888]  Well I mean it's Democrats on TV saying hashtag hunt Republicans when Scalise was shot.
[03:53:17.888 --> 03:53:19.308]  They're the ones cop killing.
[03:53:19.308 --> 03:53:22.670]  All we're saying is, you little limp dicks want a fight?
[03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:26.791]  You're about to get one once you launch it.
[03:53:26.791 --> 03:53:31.433]  This was posted by some dipshit named Scott Dworkin.
[03:53:31.433 --> 03:53:34.894]  Calls himself Funder on Twitter.
[03:53:36.238 --> 03:53:43.019]  This is the kind of harassment that patriots like you and I are forced to put up with.
[03:54:04.719 --> 03:54:06.920]  All right, let's go back to Doug Hagman.
[03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:11.041]  Doug Hagman, of course, has a lot of great websites, but his work has been impeccable.
[03:54:11.041 --> 03:54:15.642]  I mean, I remember hearing him like 15 years ago on Coast to Coast and thinking, man, that sounds a little wild.
[03:54:15.642 --> 03:54:16.903]  And then about a year later, it came true.
[03:54:16.903 --> 03:54:19.063]  And I was like, OK, well, maybe he's a little bit credible.
[03:54:19.063 --> 03:54:23.985]  He was one of the first guys I heard, like David Horowitz, say they're going to merge with Al Qaeda and the radical Islam.
[03:54:24.645 --> 03:54:28.926]  Criminal groups in the government are working with Islam, and I was a little not as sophisticated.
[03:54:28.926 --> 03:54:31.687]  I'm like, no, it's criminals in the government letting it happen.
[03:54:31.687 --> 03:54:32.947]  It was worse than that.
[03:54:32.947 --> 03:54:37.308]  So he just over and over again has broken the Wiener story over and over again.
[03:54:37.308 --> 03:54:40.329]  He's got these documents from his investigators and sources.
[03:54:40.329 --> 03:54:41.750]  They're getting ready to go.
[03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:43.090]  And you can see it, though.
[03:54:43.090 --> 03:54:45.651]  It's not like I'm not taken away from what he said.
[03:54:45.651 --> 03:54:47.251]  It's like they're saying it everywhere.
[03:54:47.251 --> 03:54:53.553]  And then he gets the inside intel of them waiting in their cells to go out and have this rite of passage.
[03:54:54.984 --> 03:54:59.686]  And closing comments, Doug Hagman, on where we are right now.
[03:54:59.686 --> 03:55:06.147]  Yeah, well, I'll tell you, I think we're living in the most perilous time in American history, in modern times anyway.
[03:55:06.147 --> 03:55:07.568]  No, I agree.
[03:55:07.568 --> 03:55:09.288]  Since our founding, this is the same level.
[03:55:11.898 --> 03:55:19.684]  Yeah, yeah, and I think people, especially conservatives and Christian conservatives, we need to wake up.
[03:55:19.684 --> 03:55:21.105]  They need to wake up.
[03:55:21.105 --> 03:55:25.529]  They need to get their heads out of their butts and see what's going on.
[03:55:25.529 --> 03:55:29.912]  We cannot allow, we cannot allow this to be pushed around.
[03:55:29.912 --> 03:55:31.073]  You gotta go to city council.
[03:55:31.073 --> 03:55:32.314]  You gotta call C-SPAN.
[03:55:32.314 --> 03:55:33.355]  You gotta get call talk ready.
[03:55:33.355 --> 03:55:34.776]  You gotta get aggressive now.
[03:55:35.729 --> 03:55:38.231]  Exactly.
[03:55:38.231 --> 03:55:41.174]  Lead, follow, or get out of the way.
[03:55:41.174 --> 03:55:42.655]  But do something.
[03:55:42.655 --> 03:55:49.981]  And I'm so impressed with our collective efforts here.
[03:55:49.981 --> 03:55:58.648]  Look, if we don't fight, if we don't fight back, that is, we are going to be ultimately wounded.
[03:55:58.648 --> 03:56:01.110]  What Roger Stone just went through with respect to the FBI.
[03:56:02.130 --> 03:56:09.756]  We go through the same thing, the harassment, the lawfare, the accusations of whatever, oh he said this or that.
[03:56:09.756 --> 03:56:12.959]  This is the asymmetrical war in which we find ourselves.
[03:56:12.959 --> 03:56:16.261]  And I'll tell you something, it gets rather old rather fast.
[03:56:16.261 --> 03:56:18.363]  They want to tie us down in defending ourselves.
[03:56:18.943 --> 03:56:20.804]  Yeah, exactly, and it costs money.
[03:56:20.804 --> 03:56:24.506]  You can have the craziest accusation out there.
[03:56:24.506 --> 03:56:26.427]  It costs money to defend yourself.
[03:56:26.427 --> 03:56:33.431]  And this is how they want to bankrupt the alternative or new media or independent media and continue to harass us.
[03:56:33.431 --> 03:56:43.837]  But the bottom line, most perilous time in human history, the reprieve that we may have gotten, like Christians talk about under Donald Trump, have we squandered that?
[03:56:43.837 --> 03:56:45.418]  Perhaps, but you better wake up.
[03:56:45.418 --> 03:56:46.663]  This is the enemy counter offensive.
[03:56:51.195 --> 03:56:52.316]  Absolutely.
[03:56:52.316 --> 03:56:53.617]  And you know what?
[03:56:53.617 --> 03:56:55.237]  We unite or we die.
[03:56:55.237 --> 03:56:56.598]  We fight or we die.
[03:56:56.598 --> 03:56:58.840]  And I ain't ready to die.
[03:56:58.840 --> 03:57:02.542]  And the fact of the matter is, I'm not going to leave this mess for my friends.
[03:57:02.542 --> 03:57:03.122]  Be honest, Doug.
[03:57:03.122 --> 03:57:04.623]  Are you not more alive than ever?
[03:57:04.623 --> 03:57:06.104]  Aren't you feeling good, actually?
[03:57:06.104 --> 03:57:07.425]  At least we've engaged them.
[03:57:07.425 --> 03:57:08.365]  We've got a beachhead.
[03:57:08.365 --> 03:57:09.826]  We're making them counter-strike.
[03:57:09.826 --> 03:57:11.507]  We're drawing them out in the open.
[03:57:11.507 --> 03:57:13.988]  They're not going to just creep around and brainwash our kids anymore.
[03:57:13.988 --> 03:57:15.930]  We're going to face them out there with their rifles.
[03:57:15.930 --> 03:57:17.731]  We're going to force them to come out and start killing us.
[03:57:18.502 --> 03:57:19.063]  Exactly.
[03:57:19.063 --> 03:57:21.184]  Yeah, it's now or never.
[03:57:21.184 --> 03:57:29.292]  And, you know, I look at this and I'm not going to allow my offspring to walk past my grave, my tomb, and say, you know, he could have done something.
[03:57:29.292 --> 03:57:30.733]  He did nothing.
[03:57:30.733 --> 03:57:32.735]  And spit on my tomb.
[03:57:32.735 --> 03:57:33.395]  I'm going to be out there.
[03:57:33.395 --> 03:57:34.136]  I'm going to be fighting.
[03:57:34.136 --> 03:57:37.839]  I'm going to be leading the charge along with people like you, yourself, and people like you.
[03:57:37.839 --> 03:57:42.503]  And we're going to take the day.
[03:57:42.503 --> 03:57:45.086]  These people have no clue of our
[03:57:45.986 --> 03:57:46.826]  Tenacity.
[03:57:46.826 --> 03:57:51.508]  Well you notice how they use intimidation, like it's, they're scaring us.
[03:57:51.508 --> 03:58:02.432]  They don't even understand, it doesn't even, it's like we just want to give them prosperity and like get them out of the way and let them have a good life, but instead they've got something missing in them so they want to push us down that are somewhat complete.
[03:58:02.432 --> 03:58:04.092]  We're not perfect, we love God.
[03:58:04.092 --> 03:58:05.453]  They wonder, what do we have?
[03:58:05.453 --> 03:58:14.756]  They want to push us down because they don't feel complete, but they should just join us and be complete the minute they did it, like Christ said on the cross, hey you just chose me, tonight we'll be in paradise.
[03:58:15.456 --> 03:58:16.878]  We love you, Mr. Hagman.
[03:58:16.878 --> 03:58:17.940]  HagmanandHagman.com.
[03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:18.801]  Thank you so much.
[03:58:18.801 --> 03:58:19.763]  Great job with the crew.
[03:58:19.763 --> 03:58:21.025]  Live transmissions.
[03:58:21.025 --> 03:58:22.126]  Infowars.com.
[03:58:22.126 --> 03:58:23.669]  Throughout tonight, throughout the weekend.
[03:58:23.669 --> 03:58:27.274]  Pray for folks in Texas and other areas because this hurricane's about to hit.
[03:58:27.274 --> 03:58:27.815]  Hurricane Harvey.
