[00:00.000 --> 00:17.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.160 --> 00:24.840]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:24.840 --> 00:44.920]  we are drugged out we are following other people's opinions we are
[00:44.920 --> 00:56.160]  controlled by the media and today it all changes Kanye West stormed the facility
[00:56.160 --> 01:03.360]  yesterday he went into TMZ and TMZ edited out a context what he'd really
[01:03.360 --> 01:06.880]  said we now have the full interview we're gonna be playing what he actually
[01:06.880 --> 01:12.400]  said so it's congruent and so it's connected to the overall thought and
[01:12.400 --> 01:16.680]  then we're gonna play the edited pieces which were obviously put out to get
[01:16.680 --> 01:23.160]  more attention so that is clearly what was done and of course the media is
[01:23.160 --> 01:27.800]  ignoring him saying we're drugged we're mind-controlled we're all under basic
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.200]  attack we need to break free of it and understand this is a prison of the mind
[01:31.200 --> 01:35.080]  they're using against us it's even in the WikiLeaks that they want racial
[01:35.080 --> 01:38.560]  division to control us doesn't mean there's not racial division doesn't mean
[01:38.560 --> 01:42.840]  that's not real it's saying they're exacerbating it they're using it to
[01:42.840 --> 01:47.840]  lead us like a big bull even though you know we weigh 2,000 pounds the globalist
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.120]  weigh about 20 pounds metaphysically but they've got us with a big ring in our
[01:52.120 --> 02:00.160]  nose leading us around through rubbing salt in the wound in a big way and it
[02:00.160 --> 02:05.680]  was of course one of the most famous ladies that ran the underground railroad
[02:05.680 --> 02:12.200]  with the white abolitionist I freed a thousand slaves I could have freed a
[02:12.200 --> 02:17.520]  thousand more of only they'd known they were slaves Harriet Tubman and that's
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.720]  what she kept saying is you're acting like slaves well there were white
[02:20.720 --> 02:24.760]  slaves in Europe at that time they were called feudal serfs but they were almost
[02:24.760 --> 02:28.720]  in as bad a shape as black slaves here they could be killed by their masters
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.960]  if they disobeyed orders it's horrible and it was Christianity that over a
[02:32.960 --> 02:39.240]  thousand years ended that so Candace Owens put out that powerful tweet Kanye
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.360]  West obviously retweeted it and that is what Kanye West is saying and I just
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.120]  really admire him he has a whole hell of a lot of courage and we really
[02:49.120 --> 02:54.680]  appreciate what he's doing that said there is a lot of other news that is
[02:54.680 --> 03:01.320]  mega massive today no one is giving us any coverage but info wars the Daily
[03:01.320 --> 03:09.800]  Mail is reporting on it and doing a great job but they're not giving you the
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.080]  rest of story Obama's favorite place to stay according to articles I've read is
[03:14.080 --> 03:18.880]  Richard Branson's private island that has a giant 30,000 square foot facility
[03:18.880 --> 03:25.880]  on it and it turns out the nexium sex cult stayed there many times and had
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.480]  large parties with Branson according to the press reports so that's the big
[03:31.480 --> 03:37.120]  tie together Daily Mail says sex cult led by Smithville or Smallville actress
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.160]  Allison Mack held wild parties on Richard Branson's private Caribbean Island in a
[03:41.160 --> 03:44.960]  bid to recruit the billionaire well there's a big detailed report the photos
[03:44.960 --> 03:48.800]  the videos it's all here the admissions of these brainwashed women being sent
[03:48.800 --> 03:53.120]  out there to be used as sex slaves and celebrity women being used to lure them
[03:53.120 --> 03:59.320]  in but missing from this is Obama missing from this is the real headline
[03:59.320 --> 04:07.720]  Obama's favorite vacation place is Richard Branson's private island where
[04:07.720 --> 04:17.000]  nexium sex cult events are held just like we see Pito Island with Epstein and
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.920]  the Clintons and Harvey Weinstein and all of the usual suspects so we have
[04:22.920 --> 04:28.640]  that incredible news then we have the really serious news Democrats openly
[04:28.640 --> 04:32.200]  this is mainstream news announced the plan to begin impeachment of the
[04:32.200 --> 04:36.520]  president and that's gonna be their 2018 official campaign slogan is impeach

[06:12.840 --> 06:16.640]  the Alex Jones show
[06:21.360 --> 06:26.800]  well I tend to open these broadcasts a lot of times by saying wow our plate is
[06:26.800 --> 06:36.440]  full but particularly today things are just ultra ultra critical and we are
[06:36.440 --> 06:48.760]  going to be laying it all out now let me just try to pull back here and get
[06:48.760 --> 06:58.880]  focused and just lay out how massive this is this is up on info wars calm it's
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.560]  up at news wars calm it's up at prison planet calm from the great folks at
[07:03.560 --> 07:15.280]  zero hedge calm and then it links directly to NBC news and other publications
[07:15.280 --> 07:22.520]  telling you exactly what I said the last few days Israel is planning to strike
[07:22.520 --> 07:32.760]  Iran they're trying to get US support right now I talked to several Pentagon
[07:32.760 --> 07:39.720]  sources last night I talked to a SpaceX source that was going to be joining us
[07:39.720 --> 07:43.440]  on the broadcast today but lawyers got involved and they're holding off of the
[07:43.440 --> 07:48.880]  individual may fly here in the next two weeks to be in studio with us so they
[07:48.880 --> 07:57.920]  can reveal who they are and some of the information they have but Israel could
[07:57.920 --> 08:04.120]  hit according to this source and then two others I called last night Tehran's
[08:04.120 --> 08:09.640]  secret nuclear weapons program which undoubtedly exist that's not debatable
[08:09.640 --> 08:17.880]  BB's not lying about that Israel has told the US military we are locked in loaded
[08:17.880 --> 08:24.360]  and may hit Iran in the next 72 hours all of Trump's generals think it's a bad
[08:24.360 --> 08:30.160]  idea the Pentagon says don't do it why do you think they're talking to me and
[08:30.160 --> 08:37.880]  they're trying to get people like Sean Hannity and Michael Savage and Rush
[08:37.880 --> 08:43.000]  Limbaugh and others to be more like Rand Paul and not push us to the brink of
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.760]  what could trigger a larger war not just with Iran but also with Russia and you've
[08:47.760 --> 08:53.680]  seen all the stuff going on on that scene so this is massive this is big and it
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.880]  ties into Kanye West now I'm going to reveal some information here on air that
[08:59.880 --> 09:04.920]  I was already partially aware of but then talking to Zach who again is a known
[09:04.920 --> 09:08.640]  intelligence source to us we know his name who he is where he is his monofinis
[09:08.640 --> 09:18.360]  is his facts is his bones Latin for bones monofinis we got the bones we got
[09:18.360 --> 09:24.880]  the facts we got the guts and my other sources I'm going to reveal to you at the
[09:24.880 --> 09:35.920]  bottom of the hour that Kanye West went to Trump Tower over a year ago when he
[09:35.920 --> 09:40.360]  was running for office and then when President Trump was president-elect and
[09:40.360 --> 09:46.040]  basically said whatever you need I'm in and and has been coordinating with the
[09:46.040 --> 09:52.480]  president a lot of what you've seen and so when you see Kanye doing all this
[09:52.480 --> 10:00.080]  he's doing this as a soldier sacrificing himself to be attacked and demonized
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.200]  just like Trump's done and Kanye's been let in on the big plan and he's on board
[10:06.200 --> 10:15.120]  a real man we're trying to go interplanetary here folks trying to get
[10:15.120 --> 10:18.400]  off the planet trying to stop killing each other over what religion we are
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.440]  what color we are all this stuff and understand the globalists are using that
[10:22.440 --> 10:25.680]  to control us doesn't mean there aren't still fights doesn't mean we don't have
[10:25.680 --> 10:30.440]  differences doesn't mean a lot of that stuff's real but we got to get it all
[10:30.440 --> 10:36.680]  out in the open and talk about fixing it will never be a utopia but ironing it
[10:36.680 --> 10:40.920]  out still gonna have some wrinkles in that jacket even though you took it to
[10:40.920 --> 10:49.600]  the cleaners but it's ironed out so Kanye West you notice now has is more on
[10:49.600 --> 10:56.440]  fire he's more confident he's ever been because he's doing the right thing and
[10:56.440 --> 11:02.080]  where his destiny is and where his soul is and that's why the establishment is
[11:02.080 --> 11:07.920]  editing what he said editing what he's done to try to say he says blacks should
[11:07.920 --> 11:12.680]  never have been slaves was their choice no he's saying we're all slaves now just
[11:12.680 --> 11:16.320]  like we were slaves previously and my identity is not being a slave as a black
[11:16.320 --> 11:19.840]  person you think black person slave I don't think that but a lot of folks do
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.720]  that's what he said and he said you think Jew you think Holocaust well yeah
[11:24.720 --> 11:29.040]  because Hollywood's made probably a thousand plus movies I search engine the
[11:29.040 --> 11:35.640]  number of Holocaust related movies it's got to be a thousand I mean it's like 100
[11:35.640 --> 11:42.880]  big ones a year it's like you go look at the movies and I feel assaulted by Nazis
[11:42.880 --> 11:47.880]  I'm sick of watching Nazis I look at Hitler my stomach crawls and then in
[11:47.880 --> 11:51.440]  the uniforms but then also all the all the stuff about World War two I know
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.960]  all about it and it's just a way to assault people's minds and have the
[11:56.960 --> 12:02.960]  whole leftist Hollywood model control Jews to make them see themselves as
[12:02.960 --> 12:08.720]  victims as well and their identity is what Hitler did Hitler killed millions
[12:08.720 --> 12:12.160]  of polls he killed 20 million Russians he killed hundreds of thousands of
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.760]  American citizens he killed a bunch of Jews it was terrible particularly
[12:14.760 --> 12:20.880]  targeted them the point is is that Japan's identity is not their emperor
[12:20.880 --> 12:24.400]  and their war crimes they committed their buddies with South Korea now they've
[12:24.400 --> 12:33.400]  moved on so it's the opening of these old wounds that are engaged in and then
[12:33.400 --> 12:40.840]  they use the diversion of Jews identity as the Holocaust when it's so much bigger
[12:40.840 --> 12:44.680]  and blacks identity is slavery here not slavery going on in a couple countries
[12:44.680 --> 12:48.760]  in Africa under Islam not hundreds of thousands of women sold to sex slavery
[12:48.760 --> 12:52.560]  just in Africa over the last few years during the whole Western funded Arab
[12:52.560 --> 13:03.080]  Spring not the articles I have here in front of me were 340 plus dead little
[13:03.080 --> 13:09.760]  girls this year were found in one Pakistan trash dump with their heads
[13:09.760 --> 13:14.560]  beat in and they have a little girl and the family stands around and says we
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.120]  don't want girls and the other daughters and the mother with the husbands
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.760]  join in with rocks they say that's biblical and you put the baby in the
[13:22.760 --> 13:26.720]  corner and you throw rocks at them till they die you bash your daughter's
[13:26.720 --> 13:35.120]  brains up that's in Reuters that's the daily mail you name it where are those
[13:35.120 --> 13:42.440]  little girls under Islam hundreds and hundreds and hundreds found in each of
[13:42.440 --> 13:48.200]  the big trash dumps nobody's speaking for them it's a blip that's going on now
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.520]  needs to stop that's slavery China's killing millions of girls a year if they
[13:52.520 --> 13:54.540]  catch you a little girl they didn't know about they come and put them in a
[13:54.540 --> 13:56.600]  bucket of water then they sell their organs
[13:56.600 --> 14:01.440]  like now they grab little kids that people hide take them take their organs
[14:01.440 --> 14:05.760]  and then kill them to keep you alive on life support take the organs put them
[14:05.760 --> 14:10.320]  on airplane flams Japan those are the real slavery my god you imagine if
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.440]  there was some country where they were selling black people's organs you'd be
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.360]  hearing about it because we've been taught only white on black crime happens
[14:18.360 --> 14:21.160]  so that we don't see everything else it's like the environmental movement
[14:21.160 --> 14:25.480]  only tells you about carbon dioxide and says it's a deadly gas this is what
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.160]  plants use to breathe and part of the carbon cycle but genetic engineering
[14:29.160 --> 14:33.400]  everything else it's killing the earth none of that's a problem because it's
[14:33.400 --> 14:44.680]  all diverted yeah researchers estimate the number of missing girls in China to
[14:44.680 --> 14:53.440]  be 80 million but a lot of people hide the little girls and so now they say
[14:53.440 --> 14:57.480]  they found millions and millions we've got an article up on screen for TV
[14:57.480 --> 15:03.040]  years of little girls people hid oh like and Frank hid in the basement from the
[15:03.040 --> 15:07.560]  Nazis for a couple years but finally got grabbed so heart-wrenching when I read
[15:07.560 --> 15:16.200]  it in seventh grade and Frank's diary what about the movies about that oh
[15:16.200 --> 15:20.440]  China doesn't allow that China owns Hollywood now has a controlling interest
[15:20.440 --> 15:27.680]  and so you don't see movies about millions of little girls hidden sleeping
[15:27.680 --> 15:33.560]  under the floorboards in rural homes like animals because they'll be killed by
[15:33.560 --> 15:38.800]  the Communist Chinese where are the feminist zero zero zero zero and if
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.520]  Kanye starts talking about that he will trump everything they've done and
[15:42.520 --> 15:47.400]  dominate them so we come back though we've got other news the Democrats have
[15:47.400 --> 15:50.720]  announced the plan to impeach Trump it's serious they're gonna run on it

[20:58.480 --> 21:03.440]  four or five months here in the United States in November that is ultra massive
[21:03.440 --> 21:07.160]  Facebook's announced a plan to completely ban all conservatives from
[21:07.160 --> 21:12.040]  Facebook this is mainstream news you cannot make this up Facebook is asking
[21:12.040 --> 21:16.200]  every poster is this hate speech that's the beginning of banning all speech and
[21:16.200 --> 21:19.840]  Facebook is now ranking news organizations based on what the Southern
[21:19.840 --> 21:24.240]  Poverty Law Center in ADL say we knew that was coming but the purge has
[21:24.240 --> 21:30.680]  intensified and I've got the Kanye West information I've got Pompeo sworn in
[21:30.680 --> 21:34.960]  just minutes ago as Secretary of State I've got Boy Scouts removed the word
[21:34.960 --> 21:40.600]  boy it's all happening Apple has moved to China and has now announced record
[21:40.600 --> 21:45.560]  profits it's moving to China that CNBC's headline Apple CEO Tim Cook takes a
[21:45.560 --> 21:50.880]  victory lap after moved to China and after other stock and revenue rockets
[21:50.880 --> 21:56.760]  on strength of iPhone X so that's right Communist Chinese government now has
[21:56.760 --> 22:03.600]  full control of the iCloud and of your Apple ID that was in Reuters two months
[22:03.600 --> 22:08.280]  ago and they said that's just the way it is Apple said in China the government
[22:08.280 --> 22:14.520]  runs everything and Chinese officials and intelligence now run Apple and their
[22:14.520 --> 22:19.280]  tax exempt and they can break any law they want and Apple executives are like
[22:19.280 --> 22:24.680]  gods in China and I wanted to raise this before I get into Kanye West and the
[22:24.680 --> 22:33.040]  video clips of him edited at TMZ and what he what he really said because I
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.600]  have several news articles that nexus in together here's one that's been picked
[22:38.600 --> 22:44.480]  up by Dr. Spiegel the Daily Mail you name it hundreds of dead newborn girls
[22:44.480 --> 22:50.000]  have been found dumped in garbage piles in Pakistan over the last year in one
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.080]  trash dump alone as a cultural preference for boys drives more parents to
[22:55.080 --> 23:00.320]  murder babies and it says that they put the baby in the corner and then they
[23:00.320 --> 23:04.080]  stone it to death and under Stockholm syndrome the mothers usually go over and
[23:04.080 --> 23:09.560]  help beat the brains out because girls aren't worth anything now you're not
[23:09.560 --> 23:14.640]  gonna hear any feminist groups talk about that in fact Linda Sorcerer that leads
[23:14.640 --> 23:20.080]  the Soros funded women's marches her mother calls for general mutilation she
[23:20.080 --> 23:24.240]  said a few months ago when a woman in Iran were organically taking their
[23:24.240 --> 23:28.160]  hegebs off saying we want freedom she said stop grandstanding keep your
[23:28.160 --> 23:44.920]  hegebs on basically now as we segue into CBS news let's tie this together for
[23:44.920 --> 23:51.560]  everybody China assigns let's type China Pakistan into the United States and
[23:51.560 --> 24:00.440]  Kanye West China assigns every citizen a social credit score to identify who is
[24:00.440 --> 24:06.920]  and who isn't trustworthy and with that social score if you're not a good
[24:06.920 --> 24:11.240]  globalist that ties into your work your internet everything your smartphone you
[24:11.240 --> 24:14.600]  then can't buy or sell or travel and basically starve to death there are
[24:14.600 --> 24:18.000]  people starving to death all over the place in China now that ties into this
[24:18.000 --> 24:25.200]  Washington Post article from two years ago that it's estimated to 60 to 80
[24:25.200 --> 24:29.520]  million girls were either aborted or killed at birth in some cases grabbed
[24:29.520 --> 24:33.440]  up to a year old and taken for medical experiments that's mainstream news and
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.960]  that's China's admission they have mobile execution vans up to a dozen in
[24:37.960 --> 24:41.960]  each major city that's mainstream news as well pull it up type in China mobile
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.320]  execution vans they brag about them imagine a science fiction movie like
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.160]  that they won't make it it's happening now for 20 years they've had mobile
[24:50.160 --> 24:56.680]  execution vans I first reported that in 1998 Falon Gong and their epoch Times
[24:56.680 --> 25:00.440]  reported on it they were the ones being grabbed Buddhist and being harvested
[25:00.440 --> 25:07.400]  they put their money together worldwide and fought back no one cares there are
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.520]  plenty of movies about blacks being slaves though it's not lessening that
[25:10.520 --> 25:14.800]  but that's it Jews were in concentration camps Hitler and blacks were
[25:14.800 --> 25:18.520]  slaves that's it worldwide they have worldwide surveys people go blacks and
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.840]  Jews and then see no massive atrocity matters after that because Hollywood
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.200]  runs the world China's bought up Hollywood and so doesn't matter if
[25:29.200 --> 25:31.880]  peaceful Buddhists and Christians are having their organs harvested every
[25:31.880 --> 25:42.920]  hour they estimate millions have been killed it doesn't matter because it's
[25:42.920 --> 25:49.040]  not trendy so researchers may have found many of China's millions of missing
[25:49.040 --> 25:54.920]  girls and it says the parents didn't register them and hid them mainly in
[25:54.920 --> 26:02.840]  rural villages now isn't that beautiful that they fought back and didn't let
[26:02.840 --> 26:07.760]  their little girls get killed or sold for body parts China's big export is
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.520]  cosmetic collagen from melted down children I first reported that in the
[26:12.520 --> 26:19.960]  US 23 years ago it's now mainstream news you heard me right children's fat is
[26:19.960 --> 26:24.560]  processed down into pills that women all over the world pop and have injected
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.520]  into their lips oh yeah a lot of that premium college and you're getting dead
[26:28.520 --> 26:38.920]  baby fat but see that's not slavery to kill a baby because that's Asian Asians
[26:38.920 --> 26:43.440]  and they can't be under tyranny only America only white people are racist
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.480]  all evil is white people and see once you have that idea you can murder and
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.760]  kill and have the UN go in and just slaughter whole African villages to
[26:52.760 --> 26:55.680]  take their land and then even put it in the news like it's no big deal because
[26:55.680 --> 27:03.000]  it's okay and there it is a board of fetuses used in beauty creams that's
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.200]  from ten years ago like I told you so Washington Times and we're TV and radio
[27:10.200 --> 27:13.080]  your radio listener they just search engine everything I say and it's right
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.400]  there researchers may have found me the millions of missing and it's talk about
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.520]  Anne Frank hiding for a couple years and the Nazis finally get her and it made
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.360]  you cry when I was in seventh grade reading it you know horrible stuff we
[27:23.360 --> 27:26.400]  know that went on George Soros helped go and tracked down the hidden Jews that
[27:26.400 --> 27:29.800]  was his job so he's now you know the one most wonderful guy in the world
[27:29.800 --> 27:37.600]  according to left this is the sickness of this but where are the movies about
[27:37.600 --> 27:43.480]  millions of little girls for years hiding and then their parents get caught
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.320]  and they don't kill the three or four year old they're so a little bit of
[27:46.320 --> 27:52.040]  humanity left they send the parents for eight years forced labor
[27:52.040 --> 28:01.000]  but where are the condescending you know liberals like out-of-control puritan
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.480]  preachers getting our faces telling us we're evil for our micro aggressions
[28:05.480 --> 28:09.280]  or the word boy and boy scouts now removed it's mother or father's hurtful
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.760]  those are all the little micro aggressions all the little I'm a victim but
[28:13.760 --> 28:18.120]  meanwhile no one cares about all the mass murder the Islamic State hundreds of
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.240]  thousands of women in sex slavery thousands of little kids being in sex
[28:21.240 --> 28:24.720]  slavery murdered throwing gays off buildings no one cares because it's not
[28:24.720 --> 28:33.040]  trendy Hollywood doesn't make movies in fact Hollywood makes movies for
[28:33.040 --> 28:37.440]  Netflix like what happened on Monday to Monday we're in the distant future in
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.280]  2073 it's overpopulated so the government has to kill six out of seven so
[28:42.280 --> 28:46.560]  only one girl can live then the girls hide see the real things going on but
[28:46.560 --> 28:49.880]  you just make a fictional movie about it in some right-wing future where it's
[28:49.880 --> 28:55.240]  going on not some left-wing current dystopic and then Conway's anti-human
[28:55.240 --> 29:01.120]  were saying we're under current attack break out of it fellow patriots my name

[31:08.280 --> 31:12.720]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and
[31:12.720 --> 31:18.400]  sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s
[31:18.400 --> 31:22.320]  researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[31:22.320 --> 31:27.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[31:27.000 --> 31:31.520]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[31:31.520 --> 31:36.240]  of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal
[31:36.240 --> 31:40.800]  distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.880]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by
[31:44.880 --> 31:49.320]  blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and
[31:49.320 --> 31:53.960]  inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[32:29.240 --> 32:34.240]  hundred dollars for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working

[34:21.600 --> 34:25.280]  all the answers doesn't mean we're telling you what to think but we know
[34:25.280 --> 34:31.320]  from documents and admissions and WikiLeaks what we already suspected big
[34:31.320 --> 34:38.520]  corporations are using race, culture, religion, sex to play us off against each
[34:38.520 --> 34:43.240]  other it doesn't mean that a mob of racist white or black or whatever coming
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.720]  up against you isn't a problem it doesn't mean that stuff's not going on but

[34:59.400 --> 35:05.400]  what he said about black slavery being a choice and he meant as all slavery is
[35:05.400 --> 35:11.560]  and that he didn't want that identity now versus what the short clip the TMZ
[35:11.560 --> 35:18.120]  edited in and was waiting for so that's coming up in the next segment and then I
[35:18.120 --> 35:23.920]  will reveal here on air information I've gotten from multiple sources about

[36:34.640 --> 36:38.680]  the most extreme interpretations of it which is the orthodoxy that's what's
[36:38.680 --> 36:43.080]  dominant now what they claim is the roots I'll I don't call it radical Islam I
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.120]  began calling it orthodox Islam about four years ago a lot of folks have
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.120]  adopted that it's not radical Islam there's heretical Islam people that
[36:52.120 --> 36:56.920]  don't want to be that kind of their own reformation and I don't want to see
[36:56.920 --> 37:00.440]  Muslims die I want to live in peace with them a lot of them aren't bad people but
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.080]  it's a follower religion where they almost all vote the same they're
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.120]  programmed by their imams and by their leaders and it fits in to take over
[37:08.120 --> 37:12.680]  parliaments of Europe where a 5 10 15 percent difference can win all the
[37:12.680 --> 37:15.400]  elections and so they're they're a tipping point they already run Europe
[37:15.400 --> 37:18.760]  Sharia laws going in everything I heard people say 20 years ago that I thought
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.640]  was crazy is happening people like Alex you fought to not have us have a war
[37:22.640 --> 37:27.000]  with Islam you fought against all these wars yeah cuz I'm a moral person and it
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.480]  was even worse than I thought they had all these wars to put even worse Muslims
[37:30.480 --> 37:34.240]  in charge to then flood Europe and then to take our rights because the Muslim
[37:34.240 --> 37:41.000]  threat and I've talked to high-level defense intelligence agency high-level
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.720]  CIA high-level State Department and they all concur that's the plan well hell
[37:45.720 --> 37:51.920]  now it's admitted so I don't want to be their enemy just like I said I want to
[37:51.920 --> 37:55.320]  transcend all this religion and race fighting but they've been formed into an
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.480]  army and they're not transcending it and they're coming so that's it and here in
[38:02.480 --> 38:05.280]  our free societies we all go a thousand different directions and are doing
[38:05.280 --> 38:09.880]  whatever and our organized they're organized they're organized to kill
[38:09.880 --> 38:12.800]  each other and always trying to take over that's why they're all trying to
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.160]  flee Islam Islam is always trying to flee what it's set up to take over the
[38:18.160 --> 38:23.120]  other grasses green and they come over eat the grass down to the roots
[38:23.120 --> 38:28.520]  everything dies the soil runs off and the society collapses literally and
[38:28.520 --> 38:37.760]  metaphysically it's a plague like locust and it tells you what you want to
[38:37.760 --> 38:41.720]  hear via victimology just like Islam has recruited so many blacks of this
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.360]  country saying when Islam launched the modern slave trade 600 years ago Islam
[38:46.360 --> 38:49.800]  still runs it and under interpretations of the Quran they say black people aren't
[38:49.800 --> 38:56.720]  humans I'm sorry it says it in in in Libya close to 30,000 blacks were killed
[38:56.720 --> 38:59.840]  even though they were Muslims because they're seen as subhuman by the Arabic
[38:59.840 --> 39:05.920]  invaders look it up see I know history I know facts and I'm sorry they're
[39:05.920 --> 39:08.720]  painful for a lot of people but this is the reality but let's expand from that
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.920]  but I'll get to the other news and the big Kanye exclusive
[39:19.960 --> 39:26.080]  you've got millions of little girls they found hiding over decades of the 60 to
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.280]  80 million killed by the government in an official government program Hitler
[39:30.280 --> 39:34.560]  hid the Holocaust till the end of World War two the Communist Chinese don't hide
[39:34.560 --> 39:38.960]  it they don't hide they're selling Buddhist and Christians organs by the
[39:38.960 --> 39:44.040]  millions the millions no Hollywood movies no TV shows no nothing a few news
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.800]  articles and then I got to hear about white running slavery in America when
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.680]  less than 2% had slaves and again I'm saying it was a bad thing but it's
[39:53.680 --> 39:59.920]  mentally ill to only obsess over that and like I said imagine a movie where
[39:59.920 --> 40:03.480]  you've got millions of little girls hiding from a totalitarian government
[40:03.480 --> 40:08.800]  that's coming to kill you and that you're unregistered it's also a great
[40:08.800 --> 40:15.600]  human story of resisting it's like Anne Frank times 5 million some estimates
[40:15.600 --> 40:22.480]  are 30 million of the 80 million hit the Washington Post is admitting this this
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.600]  is going on and I said where are the movies and Ali one of our great
[40:27.600 --> 40:34.520]  producers she said oh what happened to Monday came out on Netflix last year and
[40:34.520 --> 40:37.840]  they tell you the little girls are going to sleep and when things aren't over
[40:37.840 --> 40:44.040]  populated they'll bring them back but of course it's a right-wing conservative
[40:44.040 --> 40:46.960]  government doing it like handmaidens tale where the women were hoods over the
[40:46.960 --> 40:54.080]  heads I had no that's Islam so it's kind of like a remake of Logan's run but
[40:54.080 --> 40:58.120]  this is the eugenics going on this is the religion of the globalist this is
[40:58.120 --> 41:03.480]  happening this is going on but see they make a movie about it they don't make a
[41:03.480 --> 41:10.360]  real movie where it's going on where are the feminist the feminist or globalist
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.960]  control to keep women under the control so women don't stand up the West is
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.480]  where women got their empowerment the West is where the women stood up the
[41:17.480 --> 41:21.400]  West is where we ended slavery the West is where the fount of resistance came
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.640]  from but because we have a conscience we're taught we're the bad ones when
[41:25.640 --> 41:31.160]  it's barbarous evil everywhere else here is the trailer of the future this
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.960]  going on when it's happening now
[41:34.960 --> 41:42.640]  for three decades the child allocation bureau has combated catastrophic over
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.960]  population this simply will be processed under authority of the child
[41:46.960 --> 41:55.600]  allocation act to build a sustainable future full of hope and possibility how
[41:55.600 --> 42:01.400]  do you plan on hiding this starting tomorrow you will each get to go

[42:14.560 --> 42:22.240]  the singular identity of Karen Settman Karen you have any siblings no seven
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.880]  siblings surviving to adulthood it would destroy my credibility miss Settman
[42:27.880 --> 42:36.960]  step into the van please okay that's good you see the full trailer if you
[42:36.960 --> 42:43.080]  want but not seven women millions of women hiding and living like this and
[42:43.080 --> 42:47.440]  you don't hear anything because it doesn't fit Hollywood's evil plan now

[44:20.880 --> 44:25.040]  search to get the purest form we discovered that oil companies and
[44:25.040 --> 44:28.800]  gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.560]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out
[44:32.560 --> 44:37.840]  there's a market they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still

[47:32.800 --> 47:36.720]  telling you for a year and a half since he was president elect or longer now
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.120]  than a year and a half that Mueller would always get some type of process
[47:41.120 --> 47:45.840]  charge finding somebody in the Trump orbit who made a mistake or didn't fall
[47:45.840 --> 47:49.640]  taxes right and that's exactly what happened with Manafort and the list goes
[47:49.640 --> 47:59.440]  on and on well now Mueller may subpoena the president obstruction key focus
[48:00.040 --> 48:07.280]  serious threat and notice over and over again oh it wasn't the president oh don't
[48:07.280 --> 48:14.280]  worry oh they're not coming after you and Mueller's been caught in uranium one
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.920]  and covering up Hillary and Bill and Obama and Comey perjuring the Congress
[48:19.920 --> 48:25.360]  all their crimes aren't in focus it's all special counsel fourth branch of
[48:25.360 --> 48:29.560]  government the president is in control of that third branch the executive and
[48:29.560 --> 48:38.880]  Mueller's just a runaway special counsel he's a rogue individual that the
[48:38.880 --> 48:42.840]  media acts like is God and just sycophantically talks about you know how
[48:42.840 --> 48:55.520]  every third-world country ends up falling right they always end up falling
[48:55.520 --> 49:06.120]  over and over and over again because they put law enforcement in charge of
[49:06.120 --> 49:13.040]  some big investigation a party uses it to demonize the other party and then
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.680]  once that law enforcement federal law enforcement group has set the precedent
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.680]  they remove one president or one prime minister then they end up being the
[49:22.680 --> 49:26.840]  Praetorian Guard who are in charge of East successive administration and the
[49:26.840 --> 49:32.040]  the administration has become sycophantic and then within just a few years
[49:32.040 --> 49:36.880]  generally maybe a decade at the longest it becomes a permanent dictatorship of
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.600]  whoever the head of the federal police force was or whoever the head of the
[49:40.600 --> 49:46.520]  military was and you're the same story of Julius Caesar and Rome and the
[49:46.520 --> 49:52.680]  emperors and the same story and that's where this is going with our whole
[49:52.680 --> 49:57.880]  patrician establishment class and Mueller needs to be indicted Comey needs to
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.200]  be indicted but the Justice Department is a bunch of addled insiders and it's
[50:03.200 --> 50:08.000]  clear that the Attorney General was compromised for whatever it is I don't
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.960]  know from the beginning now let's move on to the next issue
[50:13.960 --> 50:19.360]  Mueller is getting ready to make his big move that's why the Hill is reporting
[50:19.360 --> 50:22.840]  we'll talk about this with Gary Haven billionaire businessman really smart
[50:22.840 --> 50:27.920]  guy pilot patriot guy that helped expose what's going on in Haiti goes down

[50:39.880 --> 50:48.280]  plans but first I'm going to get to Kanye and some of the secrets of what's
[50:48.280 --> 50:54.720]  going on behind the scenes on that now
[50:57.920 --> 51:02.080]  let me make a very important announcement here that's for you and your
[51:02.080 --> 51:05.280]  family but also for this broadcast the First Amendment in our critical fight
[51:05.280 --> 51:11.800]  that I know you don't want to see the globalist win you stand between us and
[51:11.800 --> 51:15.600]  Soros and Hillary and their entire crime syndicate you've heard them you've
[51:15.600 --> 51:18.440]  seen them on national TV say they're going to get us they're going to

[51:45.000 --> 51:51.560]  of thousands of dollars for us to buy per kilo well we have been able because
[51:51.560 --> 51:56.160]  leading medical facilities sell these supplements they're not prescription at
[51:56.160 --> 51:59.120]  least here in the US but they're still sold to doctors because the compounds
[51:59.120 --> 52:02.960]  cost a lot and they still mark them up five to seven times we're only marking
[52:02.960 --> 52:06.840]  this shop well less than a hundred percent on sale so it's less than a
[52:06.840 --> 52:13.440]  hundred percent markup right now this is about a 50 percent markup right now
[52:13.440 --> 52:21.240]  that's a big deal no one does that this is the super grade bio PQQ CoQ 10 that

[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:11.160]  liberalism has become as we say classical liberalism is dead and
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.080]  everybody that believes in free thought should now be considering themselves
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:20.920]  a libertarian conservative certainly no one's this person yeah I mean that was
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.200]  psychotic that was just weird but we lost the bet we said would it be racist or

[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.440]  type guys people are actually able to communicate what did I tell you Alex I
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.760]  told you today on the show I'm just a shift is happening people are waking up
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.840]  day he doesn't know he said he doesn't know what to believe it's exactly what you
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.400]  and I spoke about on the show he say doesn't know what to believe when he
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.600]  knows that he's being lied to and that is what that's what I'm preaching is that
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.560]  right now there are a bunch of liberal refugees for that once believe it what
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.120]  they were being told they don't know where to go it's time for people that are
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.200]  conservatives to wake up and raise them despite all their faults because
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.760]  globalists are dying man and I agree I'm lovingly talking to folks yeah yeah
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:24.040]  that's what I'm doing happening it's happening

[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.440]  you're saying have you I'm a human I have free speech you're an asshole why do
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.920]  you hate people
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:55.480]  I want to hear your conspiracy theories you give us an example you give us an
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:01.680]  example you're just calling me understand that you know how to curse give us an
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:07.160]  example you're the conspiracy theories I've read them okay tell us what they are
[01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:20.120]  weeks and years in advance yeah he tells you the truth and he says hey you know
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.560]  I don't want to be told this right now years later they finally admit it that
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:28.640]  you're here and that you're speaking out to people about what you've learned what
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.000]  you've acquired that you're not scared to just say what you think absolutely this
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.960]  town definitely has a lot of people that are interested in our and you know
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.600]  wearing the shirt around you got a couple different reactions but I went to
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.680]  a concert the other day and a guy came up to me actually was an older head that
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.320]  went to Berkeley probably in the late 80s and he said hey man I love that shirt
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.280]  what is that hey you know I made it it's satire and he looked the corner of
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.280]  Michael Moore he said who's that and then he said I think that guy's a piece of
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.960]  shit too and I know I'm liberal is what he said to me I started laughing and we
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.920]  were just joking about the whole thing it's actually something that you know
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:04.960]  she was just saying that I Bush had me arrested one time it's not liberal
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.000]  conservative it's about being real not being part of this tab was in front of
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.440]  everybody else for so you can rule over right I actually learned a really important
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.300]  lesson liberals just have to rest they've all descended into just having to
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:21.320]  rest all they did was cursed and f you your piece of shit it's bullshit you're
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.960]  an asshole and there was no thought behind it so there's is actually a
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.160]  psychological disorder happening and that's fascinating to see it's like
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.240]  being at a zoo and do they just watching people curse over and over again and
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.880]  there's not a sentence that can come out I asked him several times explain what
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.080]  you're saying I'm happy listening if you want to explain to me you know that
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:43.320]  Alex Jones is an asshole because you know but he couldn't get out any thought
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:46.760]  other than the curse words it was unbelievable actually I'm challenging
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:52.680]  any of them to produce a solid thought that's a good challenge you know other
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.880]  than Russian racist other than name-calling can they produce a sentence
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:02.520]  I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products we have it in

[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:35.480]  All right. We are live now into the second hour. Talk show host, filmmaker, best-selling
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.280]  author Steve Quayle is here with us. Gary Haven is going to be popping in with us a
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.240]  little bit later as well. You were here this morning on with David Knight in the morning
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.200]  show he's doing right here on the M4s Network. Good to have you here with us.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.200]  Hey Alex, good to be with you today. Hey, we got so much going on in the world. I don't
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:55.840]  know, brother, how you keep up with it? Well, I'm trying. We've got the Democrats saying
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:00.160]  that they are moving to impeach Trump. That is their new campaign slogan. U.S. officials
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.320]  as Israel preparing for war with Iran seeking U.S. support. We're going to hit it all here
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:09.600]  in just a moment. But I got behind last hour. I want to get into Kanye West and the inside
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:14.240]  baseball right now and then get your take on it. We know he's been friends with Trump
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.360]  for more than a decade. We know he went and met with him when he was president-elect,
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.560]  then when he was president. We know they threw him in a mental institution for a week saying
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:27.280]  it's crazy, you know, the Baker Act. If somebody in your family says, we think it's crazy,
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:33.200]  he likes Trump and he still came out and said, no, I like Trump. So it shows the mind control
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.920]  of them demonizing him. So he goes into TMZ yesterday and there's an edited clip where
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:45.320]  he talks about how, listen, Jews identity is now the Holocaust. Blacks identity is slavery.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.640]  We need to transcend this and not have it be our identities. And I've seen him give that
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.280]  speech before. Well, they were waiting for him to do it out of context. They edited it
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:56.320]  to make him sound like he's saying Blacks deserved it. No, he's saying all of us are
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.560]  basically slaves now to this mind control. There's a new enemy. Let's break out of it.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:05.400]  He's never lessened Black slavery. He was actually quoting, he's tweeted this, Harriet
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.280]  Tubman, of course, who ran the underground railway. Now, the lady that helped free the
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.720]  slaves with white abolitionists, she's now, I guess they're going to say KKK if they say
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.160]  that's who he is or who Candace Owens is, who's coming up later in the next hour.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:25.160]  I freed 1000 slaves. I could have freed 1000 more if only they knew they were slaves. That's
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.560]  Harriet Tubman. So I'm going to get your take on that. I'm going to play the edited clip
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:35.080]  versus him clarifying in the same clip. So he's saying, we're all drugged. We're under
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.400]  mind control. We're all under attack. Break out of the prison. Free thinking. Trump's
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:44.160]  not bad. But if you like Hillary, that's fine. That's total common sense. That's what bullies
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.520]  they are. Then they change the subject to he's now saying blacks deserve to be slaves. No,
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:52.840]  he's saying we're all in a mental prison. People are in a prison. Then when blacks decided
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.920]  to break out, when whites decided it was wrong to it ended, he's saying we have power. We
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.560]  don't just need to be victims, but they want to make people's identity, how they're victims.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.800]  Then there's the groups that feed that victimology and control it. You've talked about this for
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.160]  a long time. I'm going to play these clips and get into the inside baseball that I've
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.160]  been told by three level sources of Kanye and Trump. And my sources think it's now time
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.600]  for people to know what Kanye is doing specifically with Trump. We're going to give people the
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:22.040]  exclusive, but I wanted to get your take on this, Steve Cuell.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:29.760]  No matter what you say, no matter what Kanye say, anybody who speaks out against the scripted
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:35.000]  official programming, Alex, they come in and they absolutely distort what you say because
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.120]  they can't stand the thought of anybody telling the truth and they have to take everything
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:43.960]  put into their context because they can't take the truth in our context. The truth is
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.600]  the truth. But these guys are basically, they're worm-like editors and they worm into every
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.680]  word you say, I say, Kanye say, and they want to spin it. They spin, spin, spin. And so
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.640]  the point is they will never put us in context. You know that personally. They always take
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.280]  everything in their frame of reference and the frame of references, they don't want to
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.520]  lose control of the mind-controlled people. That's my opinion.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.120]  And in Kanye, if he's successful, I think he is, he's going to go down in history with
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.480]  all that star appeal on the number one artist in the world, trying to do what we've done
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.920]  in 20 plus years, accelerating it in just a few months. And the fact that he's standing
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:25.920]  against it is incredible. But to watch TMZ trying to set him up when he's coming in there
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:30.120]  and giving them such, such attention, or maybe it wasn't the owners of TMZ and maybe it was
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.080]  just the editors trying to get attention, but we're going to show what they showed and
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.600]  then what they later put out as what he really said, which they should have put it out. Again,
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.360]  he's not saying Jews deserve the Holocaust or Jews were weak. He's saying it shouldn't
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.480]  be their identity of just the Holocaust. I mean, think about that. That's our women
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:51.600]  thinking the West hates them when the West has empowered women, but then the, the globalist
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:56.160]  won't expose what Islam is doing to women or China killing tens of millions of 60, 80
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.040]  million little girls. I mean, that we're, where's Gloria Steinem there? Where's Linda
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.240]  Sorcerer there? So here's the short clip and we'll go to the long clip.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:11.360]  You hear about slavery for 400 years for 400 years. That's not like a choice. Like he was
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.880]  there for 400 years and it's all of y'all, you know, like it's like we're, we're mentally
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:23.200]  in prison. I like to wear prison cause slavery goes to, to direct to the idea of blacks.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:28.440]  It's like slavery Holocaust, Holocaust Jews, slavery is blacks. So prison is something
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:33.920]  that unites us as one race, blacks and whites being one race, uh, that we're one, we're,
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.080]  we're the human race. So that's just Martin Luther King, part two. Now it's no, you are
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:45.040]  your identity of the group you're in, segregate the schools again, do all of this. This is
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.080]  a plan. This is in the WikiLeaks where they're trying to divide everybody to control us.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.640]  So we don't all decide we want freedom. Now let's go to the unedited clip. Here it is
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  from TMZ.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:34.240]  Can I go back to something you just said because I don't want to let it pass. You said that
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.040]  slavery was around for 400 years at a point. It becomes a choice. Yeah, right now we're,
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:46.040]  we're, we're choosing to be enslaved. We're like, okay, so Ebro, I've FaceTime on and
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:51.440]  I'm there with Candice, right? And Ebro starts bringing up these, his version of facts, right?
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.760]  And Candice has facts. She's researched, right? Candice Owens has facts. She's researched.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.880]  And then Candice just pulls out her Jedi lightsaber and just, you know, chops Ebro's head off
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.840]  with facts. The Ebro FaceTimes me the next day and he's talking about the scoop, scoop,
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.600]  boop, boop, boop. He wants to talk about music now. I said, yo, you gonna have Candice on
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:15.440]  your show? He's like, nah, I'm not. She's mean. So you're gonna stifle her voice, Ebro.
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.920]  You're choosing to enslave people's minds. You're choosing to not let the truth be free.
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:25.560]  Can I give you my translation of what happened last week and tell me if it's right?
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560]  Okay.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:35.120]  The way I see it, you don't necessarily endorse, embrace the views of Donald Trump as much
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:42.640]  as you want to show people that they shouldn't be intimidated from showing their true feelings,
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:49.600]  expressing themselves freely, and that the hat is a lightning rod for this kind of free
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.800]  thought that is lost in our society because people get bullied and shouted down and they're
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.480]  intimidated to the point where they have to shut up. Is that fair?
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:02.800]  It's the mob. The mob tries to tell you what to think. The mob tries to make all blacks
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:08.400]  be Democrats for, you know, food stamps and stuff. It's the mob. Like, by the way, you're
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.160]  just talking to the emotion. You know, when you get Candice asked her, she's gonna drop
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:13.160]  you the facts.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.280]  We're gonna have Candice on in a bit.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:23.320]  If you ask the kid that stood in Tiananmen Square in front of the tank why he did it,
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.320]  he might not be able to explain that, but you can't diminish that moment if I can't
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.120]  give you the direct explanation.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.560]  Wow. He just did the big no-no because China now controls most of Hollywood. He just exposed
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:39.960]  where the real slavery now is going on. The mass killing 60 to 80 million little girls
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:45.840]  killed. Millions hiding under their houses like Anne Frank. Millions of Anne Franks right
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.440]  now in China hiding for much of their life because they're still gonna be killed or put
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.400]  in a forced labor camp because their parents didn't kill them. All that's going on. I'm
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.040]  so proud of Paul Watson because Candice Owens is just dynamite. You know, really magnifying
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.920]  her, pushing the real red pill, black, getting her out there. We're gonna have Candice Owens
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.800]  coming up in the last 30 minutes of the next hour today to reach her and retweet that at
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:10.640]  real Alex Jones. It's so exciting, but looking at this, I'm gonna come back on the break
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.360]  and just briefly tell you the inside baseball on Kanye West. I was given from my level Trump
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.080]  sources. I mean, he's for real.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.120]  He is for real and the problem with this whole controlled dialogue is that they don't want
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:28.520]  people to ever see anything in context, Alex. The American people need context. So when
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:33.800]  you're doing the studies and everything that we're talking about, the American people
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.920]  are starting to see, hey, wait a minute, this isn't the official story. I know there's
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.800]  more to the story. They're starting to think, they're starting to understand that they're
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.880]  only becoming a pinhole of the truth instead of the bigger picture. Right. And that's what
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.840]  we're trying to do. They've been, most people have been raised on news bites and they've
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.680]  lost the ability to cognitively think and process data. They can't put things together.
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:57.640]  And that's what Kanye Shev, we're gonna play that short clip when we come back.

[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:16.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:41.840]  Alex Jones. I was talking to syndicated radio host bestselling author and filmmaker Steve
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:48.640]  Quayle who I heard talking about geoengineering and human animal hybrids 23 years ago when
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:52.320]  I first got on air. He got on air right around the same time but he was already way ahead
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.400]  of me and I thought the guy was a little bit out there over the years. About 95% of it's
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:02.600]  all come out which is pretty frightening. But he joins us right now for 30 minutes to
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.320]  the next hour. We're going to have Gary Haven getting here as well. We're also going to
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:12.440]  have Millie Weaver popping in from the caravan site on the Mexico side because the U.S. won't
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:18.240]  let reporters get up close to it. She shot a bunch of amazing live footage with her team
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.920]  there inside Mexico yesterday but she couldn't say her piece because she probably would have
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:29.560]  had some issues as a team in Mexico. So she'll give you the rest of the report coming up.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.720]  Steve Quayle's riding shotgun with us. And then Candace Owens. Interview with Candace
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.840]  Owens coming up. Of course Kanye had her there at TMZ and all the rest of it and the fact
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:41.960]  that he's punching all this knowledge out there and saying we're allowed to have free
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:47.280]  thinking aren't we. He's calling out the elephant in the room. But I was talking to Steve about
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:53.480]  three minutes ago during the break and I said Steve what do you guess that I'm going to talk
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:22:00.480]  about with Kanye West and with Trump. And he said well I want to get into how the globalists
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.960]  need World War III and how Wesley Clark laid out the seven nations and I think it has to
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:12.240]  do with that. And as God is my witness I did not tell him or anybody yet here in the office
[01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:18.600]  or anybody else what I've been told by three level sources. One involved with SpaceX and
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:26.160]  Space Command who again could not come on today because lawyers but he's looking to go public
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.920]  soon here on the broadcast. He knows Kanye and Elon Musk and all those folks. We put the
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:37.520]  photo of Kanye in 2011 and SpaceX with Elon. We probably put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:43.920]  But I was told what was going on and of course it's all common sense. I already know it's
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.760]  good intel because I already basically understand the players. NASA is one shadow government
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:53.120]  set up to compete with the CIA and the other shadow government. And they're interlocked
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.960]  or intertwined. But there's a group that wants human exploration that doesn't want to reduce
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.360]  world population that wants to have a human future that Trump has been pushing. And Elon
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:06.640]  Musk and others are involved in that. Myself, Matt Rudge, Ron Paul, Rand Paul, people like
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.120]  that, Steve Quill. Then there's the really bad deep state actors. It's very varied in
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:18.000]  the CIA but it's the 1947 National Security Act group, that whole group. They are wanting
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.600]  a tyrannical world war, depopulation, total control. So then most of us will be wiped out.
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.440]  They can roll out the clones, the synthetic humans, the machines, all the stuff they've
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:33.040]  already got. They're 40 years ahead, the super weapons. They don't want to wait until China
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.960]  and Russia get to that technological jump point that they already had 40 years ago. They want
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.360]  to hit them now. And Trump's trying to stop all that from the intel I've gotten. That's why
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.360]  this really satanic global force is so pissed right now. And Kanye, I can now tell you,
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.760]  has been brought in by president-elect, then by the president in on the whole plan. He'd
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:57.680]  already been brought into it by Elon Musk years ago. And the whole pro-human faction,
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:01.760]  not the transhumanists, saying we're all trash, Ray Kurzweil, globalist faction,
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.480]  they don't believe in God yet. And you're the expert on this. We'll go to you in a moment
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:09.600]  to have the floor, Steve Quill. And Kanye, just like patriots in our government,
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:13.840]  drafted Trump four years ago to prepare him to run when they were looking at a coup against Obama.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.200]  And of course, he's talked to some of the generals. He testified to this. We were in D.C.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.640]  a few weeks ago. You can see that in his speech at the Mayflower. But we probably
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.720]  re-air that. We haven't aired that except once live. And he didn't even know that I knew about
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.400]  that separately. And Trump was drafted on a kamikaze mission to do this. So it's not the
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.560]  whole government that's bad. There's the pro-human faction and the eugenics death cult faction.
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:43.280]  And so Kanye was brought in on all this, briefed on this, briefed on a lot of the stuff that
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.800]  public hasn't been told about yet, like Trump talked about in his inaugural address about
[01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.160]  secrets of the universe. You're about to know them. We have technologies that'll help boost
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.160]  everything at the economy going. He's trying to do that. The globalists want to post industrial world.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:02.240]  And you notice they cut the tape and they interrupt when he goes, well, until the point
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:05.760]  of humanity, because we're way past this racism thing, they're trying to stop it until the point
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.480]  of humanity. And they cut him off right there to the point that we all basically sync up,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:14.640]  but not falsely with the internet and the computers and the AI trying to control us
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:19.360]  in a hive mind. But where we all, like Christ talked about, hit the next level. And they're
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:25.840]  trying to suppress that, basically the Holy Spirit. And so that's what Kanye keeps trying to get out.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:30.800]  They interrupt him every time. But Kanye has now been drafted into this. He's a patriot.
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:35.360]  Other people were approached. They're all cowards. So we have to give him the props that he has
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:40.960]  as this much courage. But that's it. He and Trump are working together. This is coordinated.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.840]  And they have a lot of courage. Go ahead, Steve Quill. You've got the floor for the segment
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:51.280]  of the next. The idea of a necessary World War III is absolutely the overriding and overruling
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:57.120]  dynamic that's going on behind the scenes. And Alex, what's important that people understand
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.800]  really, really get it and understand it. These people are the ones that do want to decimate
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.560]  the human race. Take it down to 500 million globalists. The best dream they have, the globalists,
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:12.800]  their best dream, our ultimate nightmare. But what Kanye did, if you remember, when he had his
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:18.720]  meltdown, he put that into the context of Jay-Z and a supernatural war going on. Do you remember
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:24.240]  that? I mean, he was worried about curses and everything else. Well, here's the deal. Many of
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:29.600]  the people in Hollywood who have been under a form of mind control are now coming out of that.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.160]  And I'm not saying Kanye is, but he- Oh, he is. He's been under mind control. I mean,
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.600]  just cultural everything. Right. But you can see he's coming out of it. Yeah, yeah, he's coming
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.080]  out of it. But others will follow. It's kind of like an icebreaker. The bow on the icebreaker
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.080]  hits the ice first and the bow on the icebreaker doesn't hit the ice first. The rest of the
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:50.160]  ship can't come through. So when we take it into the World War III context, look at where we're
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.200]  going. We're going right into Iran. They're A positioning, B positioning. They're getting ready
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:01.840]  to go at it. And what we're seeing now with the Syrian revelations of, you know, firing missiles
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:08.400]  and Trump trying to prevent World War III, and that really pissed off the powers that be, okay?
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.080]  They want World War III. They do. That's why he's doing limited things to culturally appease
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:19.520]  the Hawks, but it's actually like Redidare using TNT to blow up an oil well that's on fire.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.920]  Exactly. Killing the bigger fire with a smaller one. Exactly. And he understands the program
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:28.800]  and you know your sources tell you that. But also the thing that people have got to understand is
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.680]  this. When you and I broke the story about Deagle, Deagle is the depopulation, kind of like the
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:39.440]  Iran think tank, the depopulation of America losing up to 80% of its population. Now that was
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:45.120]  before people lose the fact or lose track of the fact that these guys behind the scenes,
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.640]  call them the global puppet masters, the Luciferians, the Satanists, they absolutely go nuts. They
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:55.200]  melt down, Alex, and all the mouthpieces that are trying to make Kanye look bad that are always
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.800]  against, quote, us, who are the free press, the last vestiges of the free press. They don't want
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:04.480]  to lose a C word and that's control. And again, we're not bragging. We're going to come back.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.880]  You're on fire. But we have been, you have been the tip of the icebreaker. We're not bragging.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.240]  That's why we're under so much attack. They know this, folks. They know we just want to win.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:15.760]  We're for everybody. We want humanity. You know, we'll point out all the garbage. I'm
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.880]  getting chills right now. And I forgot to play this clip of Kanye saying,
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.720]  hey, you're on drugs. You're under mind control. Wake up. It's happening. You can see he's there.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:27.680]  It's real. He's breaking out of it. You can tell he's got chills because your spirit knows
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.360]  we're at the choosing point right now. We're going to come back and talk more about Iran,
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:35.280]  how we stopped the globalist. But here's that clip as we go out to break with Kanye just last night.
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:44.160]  We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media.
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:50.080]  And today it all changes. And so they spin that he doesn't like black people and says they deserve
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.880]  to be slaves. No, he said, we're all slaves now. We're breaking out. Let's stop being slaves. Let's
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:29:01.600]  stop being victims. Let's declare our destiny. Bacon lovers, we ship free. Try our amazing bacon.

[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.160]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.560]  too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:47.040]  case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs, there's never
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:54.240]  been a better time to solve your problem. Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website,
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:30:02.880]  DanPillard.com. They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:08.320]  children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:14.160]  shows and awards shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:20.560]  president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:27.440]  racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:33.680]  and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. Until the only option left is for the police to
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:39.920]  do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:47.680]  outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight
[01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:55.040]  this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:31:00.800]  and I'm Freedom's Safest Place. I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up
[01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:05.120]  and I got some bad news. For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:11.200]  Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems. And this may be the last
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.960]  batch of this. We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:23.120]  gas in the atmosphere. And so in our own search to get the purest form, we discovered that oil
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:27.600]  companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.240]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs. And once they figure out there's a market,
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:38.880]  they start jacking up the price. But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:42.560]  Hopefully, just like the last time that's happened a few years ago, it's not an issue and we do get
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:48.640]  more. But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:54.480]  world. But what it does is for Stamina, libido, focus, energy is really amazing. Survival Shield
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:32:00.000]  X2 at Infoworkstore.com, Infoworkslife.com. Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide, go ahead.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:04.640]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week. Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:10.400]  patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:17.520]  in our local areas as well. And as a longtime Infoworks listener, I want to say thanks for the
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.240]  awesome brain force, Anthroplex. My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:26.880]  Thank you. I use the BioTrue Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:32.480]  normal toothpaste fans. The super blue is awesome. And thank you so much, Alex, for the Infoworkslife
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:37.440]  products. They are quality. I can't wait to get some more. And thank you so much for doing that
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:43.200]  for us to keep us healthy. Absolutely. Because then we could all as educated patriots help our
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:48.880]  other countrymen and women understand that there's a bigger problems going on. And if we can get our
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.800]  houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:04.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:20.880]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:33.040]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away. I've got to get a... Steve Quayles here in studio with us
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.440]  today. Riding shotgun always has a lot to say. Millie Weaver is out in California,
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:44.640]  is in Mexico. She's been back and forth covering the migrant George Soros funded humanizing event
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:48.960]  so that we all just open our borders completely to the collapsing Third World, that the big mega
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.600]  banks are doing everything they can to keep collapsing and under their control so they use
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.600]  our emotions against us. Just briefly here, we are listeners supported and listener funded.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.760]  We have amazing products. I just ran into one of the maintenance guys who had gout in his foot
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.160]  for a couple of weeks and the doctors, the medicine they gave him didn't do anything.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.320]  And I said, hey, it looks like you're better. You've gotten a lot better.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:23.360]  And he said, yeah, I started taking bodies and within days almost all the inflammation went
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:29.760]  away out of my foot when the medicine they gave me didn't work. That just happened as I walked down
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:37.920]  the hall. It's 25% off our ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcumin and level. The leading
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:45.600]  competitors have 3%. I know people that tell me, oh, I didn't have a big inflammation help when I took
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.000]  a turmeric product. Well, that's because most of it out there's old dried crap.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.720]  This is concentrated the curcumin and then five other ingredients that supercharge it.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.960]  Everybody needs to have bodies. It's amazing. I personally, you know, have a 80% blown Achilles,
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.800]  sometimes it really hurts when I exercise. Boom, take two of those and then four or five
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:10.800]  hours. It doesn't work like Advil though in 30 minutes. Massive, massive, massive response.
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.040]  So I just take it on a routine basis now and feel so much better. I'm going to get the Achilles
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:21.120]  fixed at some point. And I've got a smashed right hand from different activities, bones broken in it
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:28.000]  probably more than 100 times. I'm not joking. And without bodies, that just personally made my life
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:39.360]  so much better. DNA force plus now with more PQQ and CoQ10 now with more. So it's even stronger
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:45.040]  and it's less money, 50% off 74, 95. It's been our most expensive product because clinics sell
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.200]  similar things for $300 to $400 because they have five, six, seven times markup. We don't
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:58.320]  know. At 50% off right now, ladies and gentlemen, we have, I don't know, 40, 50% markup. That's what
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:04.640]  I'm telling you. Nobody, nobody does. This is a Rolls Royce formula for a Ford F-150 price.
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.560]  This is Telomere support, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple eight, two, five,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:15.600]  three, three, one, three, nine. Steve Cuell, the Q files is here with us. We're going to get into
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:22.480]  the announcements, U.S. officials, Israel preparing for war with Iran, seeking U.S. support, NBC News.
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:26.080]  I was pretty clear with what Netanyahu said. I don't like the Mullahs. I don't like Iran.
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:32.400]  But you talked about it yourself and what the globalist fear of this awakening and why they want
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.560]  war and what you think Trump's really doing and how this ties into the open borders in Europe,
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.800]  our borders here, and we're going to go to Millie Weaver to ride shotgun with us. There's Millie
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.800]  there right now. Let's just pop her for a second. We're going to go back to Steve here for a moment,
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.760]  but where are you right now, Millie? Well, right now I'm in San Diego, California,
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:55.920]  back at my hotel. But yesterday we were down in Tijuana, Mexico, right on the Mexican side of
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:01.040]  the border, speaking with the migrant caravan. I wanted to go down there and investigate and
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:06.400]  find out exactly what is going on with this migrant caravan situation. And I'll tell you,
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:12.560]  the liberal media is out there saying that these are all refugees that are in immediate need for
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:17.520]  safety and protection inside the United States. What I can tell you is that what I found out
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:24.560]  from the migrants themselves is that that is actually not true. None of them felt in danger.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.680]  I had a translator. You can see my translator right there, Louis in the poncho. And he did a
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.040]  great job conveying what these people were saying to me. And it was pretty clear. They said, no,
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:40.160]  not in any fear of safety. We just want to come to America for a better life. And that's the thing.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.360]  Most of them are nice. Most of them are nice. They're telling the truth. But they're being
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:48.240]  used as a weapon. And the media is lying about the fact that 98% aren't refugees. So there's
[01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:53.440]  your headline. Migrants admit they're not in danger and are not refugees that they are simply
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:57.760]  seeking a better life. Good. But you can't come in and have the Democrats put you on welfare and
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.480]  turn you into this bombshell information. We need to codify all this into one big article.
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.240]  This needs to go incredibly viral. Stay there, Millie. We're coming back to you. Steve Quayle,
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:10.800]  Big Picture, getting into what we just talked about with this Iran situation. I see that as front
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.400]  and foremost. How does this tie to the strategy with North Korea, with the Peace Prize, with the
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:23.440]  Korean War about to end? What's going on behind the scenes? A total quantum chess game, Alex,
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.960]  that's in multiple dimensions. And just like, let me make it really clear, you've got all these
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:32.960]  different theaters. You've got the Middle East. You've got the border situation where the immigrants
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:38.720]  are being used and they're weaponized immigrants. We've seen the plan. The plan is to flood the
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:45.360]  West, destroy Christian culture, and absolutely bring about total mayhem. We've heard this so
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:50.800]  many times. We've listened to it off and on for 20 years, and now it's all in place. So remember,
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.400]  they will victimize anybody to make the people focus on the victim, but they don't understand
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.560]  who's doing the victimization. And that is the globalist. And again, people got to understand
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:06.480]  this. There really are nasty people out there, and these people are willing to kill a lot of people.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.080]  So they're all these theaters, North and South Korea. The Democrats just melted when someone
[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:18.480]  suggested that maybe Donald Trump should get the Nobel Peace Prize. Well, the idea is simply this,
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:25.120]  control all avenues of discussion, but keep your eyes, keep the people's eyes busy. I'm telling Alex,
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:31.440]  they need, they want their building towards a third world war. That's the only way that historically
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:38.080]  they can bring on their change artists to bring the world into a peaceful mode. And biblically,
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:43.440]  it's the Antichrist, the guy that's coming on the scene. And now China is having a world score
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.720]  that we're adopting that tracks everything you do on the internet and live time. If you're not a good
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.960]  globalist, then you get your score lowered to the point you can't work, you can't travel, you can't
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.040]  eat, and you die the literal mark of the beast. And last segment, I was going to erupt, but I didn't
[01:39:55.040 --> 01:40:01.840]  want to do it. Anybody can type in Oprah Winfrey, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, and others meet to discuss
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:06.720]  world government and overpopulation. And it was in the Wall Street Journal, it was in the Washington
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.760]  Post, it was in, and they admitted they all met in New York secretly, but they wanted the public to
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:16.160]  know they're setting up an alternate world government, as if David Rockefeller didn't set it up himself,
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:22.480]  and that they wanted to talk about depopulating Africa to begin with. So imagine if Kanye West
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.040]  said, I want to depopulate Africa and blacks can't have air conditioning or cars in Africa,
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:32.240]  you'd say, what are you, you know, Hitler? But when they say it, now there it is, Wall Street Journal,
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.400]  if they say it, it's cute, it's funny, it's sweet, billionaires try to shrink world population reports
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:43.360]  says, I mean, and they're all tax exempt, they put their money tax exempt towards this, then they
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:48.000]  call them philanthropists. Well, that Hitler was a philanthropist. I mean, and then they're led by
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.200]  George Soros, one of their key generals, who is a literal Nazi collaborator that hunted down people
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:59.600]  like Anne Frank. Absolutely. And he said that proud of Stan is life was leading Jewish people into
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.480]  the concentration camps. And here's a guy, and this is one question, I think I asked Roger Stonis,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:11.200]  too. Why is George Soros allowed to create so much mayhem in the not only United States,
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.920]  but all over the world? Who does he work for? I don't know Alex, I know he works for the globalist,
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.960]  I know he works, but I think he, here's what I think, I think he works for the invisible. When I
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:25.120]  see invisible government, you and I have split so many years. The super deep state, the global
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.920]  international corporate super state, even the two James bonds ago, well, yeah, they admitted it was
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:34.080]  the quantum group, and then he's been and he is like, they believe he's the real leader of specter.
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:40.560]  And again, the former top guy and in my six and OSS, he and Fleming, he wrote those based on what
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.120]  was really going on. It's the same thing today. He's the head of specter. Yes, he is. And the thing
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:48.640]  that is important for people to understand everything we're seeing in the movies now,
[01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:54.320]  everything we're watching on television, all the new shows, everything is basically people are bad.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:00.320]  The world they've created is produced a zombie adventures and paradise, and they have the solution,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.400]  they have the answer. And the story that you just brought up that showed on the screen,
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:09.360]  I mean, you've got Bill Gates openly calling for the elite to rule the world. And see, if that
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:14.960]  doesn't anger everybody who is quote, a peasant, when you're talking about killing off nine tenths
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.680]  of the world's pie and they're doing it at Ted TV talks. Yeah, well, and then we're under attack
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:24.240]  for saying it's bad and Kanye's a racist. Give me a break. Well, you know, here's the thing.
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:29.200]  We're at the point now where people have got to stand up, they've got to speak up,
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:35.440]  they got a basically pony up. The idea that free press and what you see here on info wars,
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.000]  what you see on, you know, any form of alternative press, it's really telling the truth.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.040]  The point is, ladies and gentlemen, these are absolute weapons of mass destruction. We're

[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:31.760]  hours of live streaming we need to post this one article as soon as possible obviously that's our
[01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:37.120]  job uh with the bombshell you talked to hundreds of the migrants the caravan folks that were very
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.880]  honest they said no we're not scared we're not fleeing fear we want to be in america but the media
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.120]  has this one woman and her children up at the front well i mean you got to take care of her it's
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:53.840]  asylum that's what obama used saying oh it's kids for those years we ordered no border apprehensions
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:59.280]  and then nobody shows up for three four years uh to the uh border hearings to the immigration
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.680]  hearings this is the end of our border this is the collapse of latin america but the problem
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.760]  for the globalist is mexico is a close to a first world nation in many areas they're on the very top
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.240]  three percent four percent of you look this up of third world nations they're almost first world
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.840]  other than the crime rate and some of the rural areas they know collapsing guatemala nicaragua
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.040]  el Salvador venezuela into them will mean total collapse cultural implosion these groups are all
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:29.040]  very tribal they're in tribal groups in venezuela you name it always fighting with each other
[01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.600]  communists versus this this is collapsing civilization into the el norte and mexico's el norte
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:41.920]  not just us and so this is a big big deal meli that you've exposed this you and gabin so congratulations
[01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:48.720]  lay it out for us so we have the opportunity to both go into the migrant caravan and also
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:54.960]  go check out some of the casa de inmigrante which is the house of immigrants which are places
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:58.960]  shelters for immigrants which many of them were also being housed at that's going to be in our
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:04.800]  special report that we put out and standing around outside of that were some very nefarious looking
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:11.120]  guys look like they could have been cartel members or protectors or coyotes and so what we've spoke
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:16.400]  to some of the locals out here in mexico what they say is that they have a greater chance of getting
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:23.840]  through under refugee or asylum status if they have children with them so human trafficking is
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:30.000]  associated with this caravan and they tend to bring children because it increases their odds of
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.280]  getting into united states but this is all about just getting into the united states to work in the
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  u.s in order to bring fam money back to their families or back to their cartels or get cartel
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:46.800]  members into smuggle drugs you know the guy louis who was our translator as nice as he was he told
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:53.600]  us his background story and that he was deported from the u.s for smuggling heroin so there's
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:58.560]  it there's a culture of drugs in mexico i would say that you know the people in the caravan were
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.360]  no safer than the whole entire rest of the country in mexico but mexico is almost like a third world
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:09.600]  country and many other countries across you know the whole globe are in this same situation so we
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:14.720]  can't say that hey these are people in immediate need for help and they need to get in or because
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.280]  their safety is compromised because that's just simply not the case and if it were you would have
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:24.640]  billions of people coming to the u.s and we just can't do that it would collapse our system
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:30.000]  and that's exactly what the globalist want to do now the globalist would like america to be run
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.600]  exactly how uh mexico is run they actually have a maximum wage in mexico you cannot get paid over
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:43.600]  a dollar 75 in mexico even american businesses that come down there are not allowed to pay their
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:51.280]  employees more than a dollar 75 and even into um central mexico it's it can even be 25 cents so
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:57.600]  they're getting paid such low wages they want to come you know get in get a us passport or visa
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:04.160]  or citizenship to commute across the border work in san diego work in in you know american
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:10.320]  countries and then commute back to their homes in mexico or just live in america and send their
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:15.440]  money back to their families so that's essentially what these people were expressing what they wanted
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:20.720]  to do it's essentially a business model it's for financial gain none of them were refugees
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:27.280]  none of them felt like they were in any immediate danger or fear they were being taken care of
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.720]  better than most of the other citizens in mexico because they had all of these democrat ngo's
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.680]  american organizations coming out and feeding them so these people were perfectly fine they had
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.480]  already been given refuge in mexico so for the liberal media to claim these are refugees that
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:49.280]  need immediate help it's just absolutely not true it's it's a lie well you're on fire and i just
[01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:56.960]  heard pure veritas from what our great reporter and team laid out there on the us mexican border
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:53:03.360]  in california uh let's talk about the big picture here steve well well the big picture
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:08.480]  at alexis are being stopped the powers would be that want immigration to destroy us like the rest
[01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:13.760]  of the world hey people want to believe it or not but there is the plan to turn every single
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:20.080]  nation's world into a internal civil war so that you have nothing but strife it's sololinsky on
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:26.080]  steroids we're talking about the ideal if you will rules for radicals and we're talking about every
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:32.400]  single rule being lived out and the media the mainstream media that portray us as quote untrue
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:38.960]  news or false news fake news they don't get the picture and the ones that do they get the paychecks
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.120]  from the deep deep state and i want to make it clear i'm talking when i talk about deep state i'm
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.560]  not talking about what everybody thinks is deep state i'm talking about 13 families that are so
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.920]  far hidden beyond the old builder burgers and all the uh ross childs that stuff that's that's not
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:54:01.520]  the level i'm talking about i'm talking about such a supernaturally evil uh cadre of satanists who
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:06.080]  are some of the most powerful people and it shows soros to be its renfield backman because he rounded
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:11.920]  up thousands of his fellow jews thousands of an frank's and he's targeting us we've been told
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.480]  he's financing lawsuits against us because we keep saying he was a nazi collaborator well he said it
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.320]  on 60 minutes so now i say it every hour not every week well the idea is this no matter what you do
[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:26.880]  no matter what you say no matter what you think the attack has got to be on the truth because these
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:32.960]  people will not acknowledge the truth for kanye to say what he said for what millie's doing on the
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:36.800]  border i mean millie how many people are down there i mean i don't know how many the main
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:41.600]  networks are down there but see all they do is they give little bites oh they're like oh these
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:47.120]  report victims oh they're all i mean millie you've been there one of you witnessed well you know there
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.880]  are hundreds of migrants down there but there are no worse of a situation than the whole rest of
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:57.360]  you know the population down in mexico there are actually mexican children there they're
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.560]  in worse situation because in mexico will not mexico will not take them that's a un term we all
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:08.400]  use migrants no they're called invaders coming here illegally absolutely and again you know i'm
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.680]  sorry go ahead mexico actually they their immigration policies are actually kind of strict
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:18.000]  sometimes a lot of times they will find these people and deport them but when they come with
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.160]  children they know that the federales are more lenient so that's why they have the children
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.440]  there and the federales are simply allowing them to be there uh you know to essentially
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:33.280]  try to ask for asylum in the us or it would be that they could just kind of go under the radar
[01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:39.680]  not being a big protesting group and then they could actually stay in mexico more likely because
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:45.040]  it is pretty lenient of a government down there and it is mostly run by cartels uh the situation
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:50.720]  politically down there is pretty bad i would say that there's a lot of uh communist latina groups
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:55.360]  in america that are pushing for communism they don't want big business but what's going on is in
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.480]  mexico they do not have big business there at all there are limits on business actually they have
[01:56:00.480 --> 01:56:05.760]  big cartel so where do the politicians get their money they have to get their money to run for office
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:12.000]  from the cartels so right now this is political season in mexico they've had about three you know
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.560]  every three days there's a murder of somebody who's running for office there it's a death
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.520]  sentence to try to run for president or office in mexico because essentially your opponent will
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:28.320]  buy off cartel and the cartel will will murder you yeah they've got a mafia government of conquest
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:33.360]  and just like mexico was once vibrant roam and idly was once vibrant and then when it became
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:39.280]  an empire and corrupt it rotted and it's the same thing when it goes into the ruling of the thug
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:46.480]  venezuela was once as rich as the u.s till the 60s shame was argentina but socialism came and
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:51.760]  then the same path we're on ladies and gentlemen and the elite leverage out the money they devalue it
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.680]  they buy up swiss chateaus and then when it all implodes people are wanting something free when
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:01.520]  communism ends and everybody's literally eating their dogs eating their cats i mean like three
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.720]  years ago they'd already eaten their dogs and cats that was like the washington post they'd already
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:09.920]  uh and now it's just kids eating out of garbage cans thousands of people starve the death of
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.160]  weak with the government passed the law you can't call it starvation well it's not only that but
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.160]  cannibalism is coming back worldwide okay even in cancun the old ways and this isn't picking on
[01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:25.040]  mexico but they're finding people alex that are having their hearts ripped out just in the last
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:29.600]  week okay that's like mexico even cancun's not safe i love cancun can't go there anymore yep you
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:35.440]  can't go so here's the thing and go to cancun they want fear they want fear to be the driving force
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:41.600]  they the uh globalist the satanist and let's call them ultra black world leaders and what by that i mean
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:48.640]  ultra hidden world yes yes secret we'll be right back stay with us we've taken thousands of years

[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:48.160]  is attacking i'm going to 11 steve crank it up alex because here's the deal we can't break any
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:53.040]  longer they're full speed ahead they're full throttle they're absolutely getting to the point
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:58.560]  where they're forcing the sides okay one minute you've got somebody who's your friend the next
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:03.280]  minute you they they turn into your mortal enemy when you don't toe the line with what they think
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.400]  and that's the problem they got to learn to that in Shapiro said no you don't go on there i'm the
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:12.320]  boss i'm like the liberal media i tell you who can be on there and who can't well he's a puppet
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.560]  person then you know the little ham puppet guy the point is is that in my opinion here's the
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:22.640]  ben Shapiro look i ain't in charge now here and what's he in charge of here i mean i can make that
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:32.560]  face you look what is he in charge of i'm ben Shapiro and i'm very smart i measure my words
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:38.160]  very carefully so you went down to the border you're not ben Shapiro millie weaver what you do
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:45.520]  huh or you're not me are you oh you know we just kind of exposed that this whole migrant caravan

[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:08.080]  let several waves into the united states it's word is catching on and so a bunch of people are now
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.280]  jumping onto the caravan and you're gonna have more and more more people showing up at the border
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:19.440]  trying to fraudulently gain entrance into the united states under the guise of being refugees
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:24.880]  when that's just simply not the case and remember this is to disrupt the system you know that the

[02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:26.240]  what an intellectual i think i'm gonna start playing a part of him like once a week because
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:30.160]  i can do an imitation of him and kind of sit there real conceded good well you actually
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:35.360]  you'll see yeah there's a thing called liberals and i'm real smart uh yeah sorry uh sorry millie

[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:46.160]  we're getting closer okay millie you got interrupted by the break uh we've gotten
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:53.200]  authorization from um ben Shapiro for for you to be able to speak he's now authorized it so go ahead
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:09:01.600]  oh okay thank you uh ben Shapiro thank you for that permission uh okay so getting back
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.200]  to the migrant caravan situation we have a situation where it's growing because they've
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.200]  started letting people in there's going to be more and more people going down there and that's
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:17.680]  why i ask everyone who's watching this feed please go on to my youtube channel millennial millie
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:23.680]  and find this video uh please share it people need to see this the word needs to get out the video
[02:09:23.680 --> 02:09:31.760]  is titled exposed immigrant caravan not refugees you can also find this video on the info wars.com
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:38.000]  but the sure bet is to find it on my millennial millie on youtube channel uh these migrants
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.200]  say it for themselves people need to hear but listen this takes away from ben Shapiro this takes away
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.320]  from ben Shapiro you know he doesn't go down to the border he doesn't go into the migrant refugee
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.080]  invasion center over the mexican border in danger with the info wars crew no he decides
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:59.120]  who goes on my show he doesn't actually go out and do anything he just tells us how intellectual he is
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:04.320]  and then makes real little smart man faces uh so again it doesn't really matter what you did millie
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:08.480]  or how groundbreaking you have hundreds of the so-called refugee migrants admitted they're not
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:14.000]  really in danger and they're just an invasion force of the democratic party in soros uh it just
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:20.240]  doesn't matter because it's not authorized by ben Shapiro exactly and one of the points that i was
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:26.080]  trying to make earlier regarding the the businesses and how the mexican people have such low wages
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.800]  you know you have this culture of americans complaining about big business in america
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:35.920]  and we complain that big business lobbies to our politicians and buys our politicians
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:41.680]  which to some extent that is bad but would you rather have it that we don't have big business
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:47.040]  here at all like mexico and so that essentially the cartels are the ones buying politicians
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:55.360]  and running free essentially the mafias if we were a mafia driven controlled uh country just like
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.600]  mexico you can see how that's happening down there and so those are some of the pitfalls of
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:05.360]  communism and these policies that would drive out big business once you lose big business the mafias
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.360]  buy up all the politicians and it's game over just like what we're seeing in mexico they've got a
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:14.640]  lot of problems down there from what i could see most everyone was anti trump uh because the mainstream
[02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:20.320]  media has done a good job telling all of the people in mexico that trump hates mexicans which
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:26.560]  simply is not true it's an edited up clip he doesn't want people coming illegally into the united
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:31.040]  states regardless of what in mexico has controls and and all the rest of it he didn't say the
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:35.280]  things they said just like they do to us the assassin our character it's mainstream media
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.600]  against reality millie weaver uh great job reporting continued reporting i know you've
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:44.800]  got more explosive live reports coming and more hd reports not going to say what you're planning
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:51.040]  next for your security but you and gavin i just want to say godspeed thank you alex thanks i appreciate
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:57.840]  it thank you now i want to get into uh the whole situation with kandace owens and kanye west and
[02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:03.280]  now mark dies is involved our good buddy we need to get back on the show and
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:11.040]  ben Shapiro ben Shapiro does some good things but he just basically recycles libertarian
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:18.080]  conservative arguments and does it in a kind of squeaky pontificating egghead way and makes a little
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:27.200]  egghead faces and things that is is really a bunch of puffery or he festoons himself with a pecanic
[02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:37.520]  uh behaviors uh basically of festooned arrogance to create an atmosphere uh of looking down the
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:44.000]  nose elitism which is supposed to shock those of us in flyover country into just staggered
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:52.240]  polaxed lightning struck thunderbolted jellyfish before his godlike visage pouring out upon the
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:13:00.240]  fruited plane the very elixir of enlightenment and next level thinking but that said it's a bunch of
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:06.000]  recycled stuff jordan pierce and nice guy smart it's all carl young stuff i mean there it is show
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.520]  info wars is original it's trailblazing it's cutting edge our guest star and the fact that he would
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:17.280]  say no no no kandace don't go on alex jones' show and he runs around i learned always doing that
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:22.880]  trying to police things that's what the left does the elite coast and the so-called new right wing
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:28.320]  god gods were given that youtube and others don't really block like Shapiro they're put out to control
[02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  us and corralis then Shapiro as mark dice points goes on cnn he goes on places he disagrees with
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:38.000]  as if kandace ellens people disagree with me the media misrepresent what i say about sandy hook or
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  other demonization points so they can demonize me and try to keep people from coming on just
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.600]  so they can control who talks to who the very thing kanya sings a bad thing so to cause a debate
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:53.360]  about this i made a decision today to do what i will tell you about at the end of the hour
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:59.840]  when kandace ellens is on for two segments kandace ellens on this show here sitting right here so
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:06.720]  that's happening and you know it'll all make sense later but i knew people like Shapiro would do this
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.920]  and so that's what this is all about this is gonna be a major teaching moment here to expose all of
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:16.960]  this i could sit here with a fake british accent and then look at you like Shapiro or an east coast
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:24.560]  elitist accent oh yes i don't do it i'm not a fake i have my own operation we're bigger than limbaugh
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.840]  now okay we're not trying to be the biggest but these guys want to be the biggest steve well listen
[02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:35.840]  alex when you get your head above water and the water i'm talking to is about that drowning level
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:40.800]  of the mainstream lies that go out there then people take notice and and this the thing that
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:46.160]  people have got to understand i think it's critical is ladies and gentlemen what happens what happens
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:50.800]  i want everyone to ask themselves this question what happens when the voices that you're hearing
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:56.640]  now on info wars what happens when they go away because when we go away that means they're going
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:02.960]  to come and take you away alex people have got to step up stand up and and live listening to this guy
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.360]  ben Shapiro i don't even know him okay i don't pay any attention that he's arrogant he thinks he's
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.440]  the number one guy in the world but like who's that yeah i don't know him he just goes i can't i
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:17.920]  can't talk to that but i can talk to the scripted scenario of the mainstream press that does nothing
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.960]  but just read you know what i called him this is a great statement they're vomit brokers okay
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:29.920]  now i wanted to find vomit but look at that young whipper snappery bow to him well neil bow i you
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:35.760]  know so bow wow i don't know who that megalomania yeah but here's the thing alex the guys that
[02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:42.320]  are trying to control the narrative they always have ulterior motives when you're originating
[02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:46.720]  the narrative and say listen think of this you're being told do this do that think this think that
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:51.360]  when you break out of that that's what makes them nervous i know exactly and imagine i would never
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:57.680]  tell somebody who to have on it's such a little authoritarian punk you have been lied to my name

[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:04.480]  bad news for the second time in the five and a half year history of survival shield x2 our
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:10.160]  flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the last batch of this
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:15.840]  we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas
[02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:21.280]  in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that oil
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:25.760]  companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.400]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:37.040]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells out
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:40.720]  hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:47.200]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine in the world

[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:30.160]  okay i wanted to point out the type of gatekeeping that's going on
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:37.920]  and so i decided to do an experiment and i've been completely truthful about the experiment
[02:20:39.040 --> 02:20:43.200]  uh breaking it down except for one of the tweets that the crew didn't get exactly right
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:47.840]  it's connie west who's not on the show and is not coming on next segment canis oans talks about
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:53.600]  connie west here on the show so that's what's coming up in the next two segments and i did this
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:21:00.080]  though to make an example out of the stuff that goes on and how the gatekeeping operates and how
[02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:04.800]  it's used against everybody and it's a junior high mentality and it's everything canis oans and
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.360]  connie west say they're against so that's what's coming up i'm not in hollywood i'm not on the east
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:16.960]  coast or west coast i'm here in texas we built our own thing and my audience doesn't like celebrities
[02:21:16.960 --> 02:21:21.600]  our audience doesn't like chasing me establishment they tune out like that good thing already have
[02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:26.800]  the same taste but i like trailblazers and mavericks and people that go against the grain like donald
[02:21:26.800 --> 02:21:33.920]  trump or matt drudge and so we're gonna have two segments of canis oans in studio right here and
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:38.080]  then i'm gonna come back and give you the rest of the story and ben should appear and all these
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:42.640]  folks saying don't go on don't do it all his fans turned against him on twitter he's not the one
[02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:46.480]  of these guys that says he's anointed and just sits up there everybody's supposed to bow down to him
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:52.960]  there's a bunch of recycled stuff almost all of it and then when his fans attacked him i saw
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:57.120]  her in the break he's like oh no i'm not commanding you what to do yeah you are you're an arrogant
[02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:06.240]  person it just drips i can't even look at you and we see this so many places the same arrogance

[02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:10.640]  civil war happening black people that are focused on their past and shouting about slavery and black
[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:14.800]  people that are focused on their futures okay i can guarantee you what you're seeing happening
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:20.320]  is victim mentality versus victor mentality victim mentality is not cool i don't know why people like
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:24.720]  being oppressed the weirdest thing i've ever heard i love oppression but we're oppressed 400 years of
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.280]  slavery jim crow which by the way none of you guys live through your grandparents and it's embarrassing
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:34.480]  that you utilize you utilize their history you're not living through anything right now
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:41.600]  you're overly privileged american truth is that the left wants to strap black people to this idea
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:45.280]  that they are victims that's what it comes down to they do not want black people focus on their
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:49.360]  futures they want black people focus on their past they like black people to be government
[02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:53.440]  dependent they don't like to see black people that are free thinkers and are independent i think
[02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:58.560]  that's what kanye west and myself represents this is a tremendous time to be alive as a black
[02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:03.760]  american we've been existing under this facade these lies the democrats have orchestrated because
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.800]  they consider us a low information voter market you know and they so they think we're not going to
[02:34:08.800 --> 02:34:12.960]  research the stats and we'll never find out i hate the race card it's played every election year
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:18.720]  every four years the democrats rally to get the african-american vote and we give it to them because
[02:34:18.720 --> 02:34:24.560]  well republicans are racist right we usher them straight into the white house where they immediately
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:28.480]  forget about all the promises that they need to us for so long they have told us that because
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:34.400]  there was a black president this meant progress progress is not a skin tone progress is a number
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.120]  okay and for so long we've been convinced look he's taking a photo up with Beyonce and jz that
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:45.040]  means absolutely nothing chicago got worse while obama was in office and he came from there it's
[02:34:45.040 --> 02:34:49.760]  just the truth it's what i've been preaching about long before kanye wrote this seven word tweet that
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.880]  broke the internet is that they at once they enslaved our bodies democratic party but say they
[02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:59.280]  have enslaved our minds i was a liberal and i can tell you exactly why it has to do with the
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:04.480]  educational system we learn our history wrong we learned that lbj was the greatest president
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:09.200]  for black america and that couldn't be more false i mean what he did essentially has enslaved us
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:16.080]  the democratic party i love the way kandace owens thinks red pill black ladies and gentlemen is
[02:35:16.080 --> 02:35:20.640]  the youtube site for now they're trying to ban her kandace owens is here for the establishment
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:26.720]  is demonizing because this is the future the people now have a voice the people now all have
[02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:33.520]  their own tv network and it's game over for the arrogant people at msnbc seeing it and even fox
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:38.640]  trying to stop this revolution has gotten watered down and lost half their ratings don't they get it
[02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:43.040]  you're not going to stop progress i think that they are starting to get it because as you said
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:48.240]  they're losing and they keep losing and they can't stop losing and it's an exciting time to be alive
[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:52.320]  and i encourage everybody out there get your voice out there don't be scared to say whatever
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:58.400]  you're thinking nobody can stop you well i'm just impressed with all the work you're doing and the
[02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:02.320]  fact that you didn't give up when they banned your videos blocked your videos you fought back
[02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:07.840]  they had to restore them so many people quit no no you never quit they're just trying to wear you
[02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:11.920]  out and now there's about to be anti-trust hearings trumps appointing a guy to the federal
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.840]  trade commission that wants to go after google i mean it's on good i'm so excited to hear about
[02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:19.840]  google because they are really doing the most evil work behind the scenes and facebook too
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:23.280]  they were put you know totally promoting the article if you search for me on facebook that
[02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:28.400]  salon hit the new face the toxic right the new face the toxic right had 20 shares and videos
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:33.440]  that had a hundred average 100 000 shares every time just one person puts it on their platform
[02:36:33.440 --> 02:36:38.160]  on facebook and that was what was coming up well google admits their whole algorithms fake now right

[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:02.640]  more and more and people have to sit and they have to think deeply about the implications
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:07.200]  of these people controlling everything from your food to your media to your google jeff vizos is on
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:12.640]  twitter google uh he's a whole foods amazon it's just these are things that we have to really think

[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.520]  just saying it i mean you're just you just lay it all out so ladylike but also it's good stuff
[02:38:05.520 --> 02:38:10.160]  yeah that's what i try to do i try to i don't i keep it really PG and i try to keep it honest

[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:20.560]  out bombshell podesta work the same ukranians as manifold and when it turns out both podesta brothers
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.120]  got tens of millions of dollars from the russians with hillary to transfer the iranium something
[02:38:25.120 --> 02:38:31.360]  we broke a year and a half ago and and and that they have the russian connections not us but no wonder
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:36.560]  they did this just like roger stone said a year and a half ago they blamed us for what they've done
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:40.960]  right but hypocrisy is is their middle name you know what i mean they don't care they can get caught
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.520]  doing the things over and over again and they can be caught red-handed as they have been done over
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:49.840]  and over again and they don't care they double down on their ignorance time and time again and
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:56.000]  honestly it's it's just um it's getting boring at this point but that's the stunts they just like
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:02.240]  parents on every channel say russia russia russia russia when when the fbi former fbi had mewler
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:07.280]  was the backman for iranium and in companies getting millions of dollars himself from the russians
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:12.720]  you literally have a guy with the russian arm up his rear end puppeting him he's a sock puppet
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:17.040]  then claiming the people that aren't are the russian agents right and that's what they do
[02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:22.800]  that is what they do well you know this is going to be all over the news this is going to be
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:27.120]  everywhere like proof they yelled at him and said he was a russian and this is what they do to me
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:32.000]  it's so pathetic right they said that yesterday about me you know that i'm uh somehow a spy i mean
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.920]  they turn things they anything that's a threat to them they try to control the narrative that's
[02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:39.280]  because they're the outsiders they're the globalists i'm ranting sorry no you're right you're
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:43.600]  absolutely right they are the globalists and that is exactly true and they're losing power so what
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:47.440]  we're seeing is kind of like a psychosis you know and they don't know what to do they're losing
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:51.920]  power they've been in power for so long and a new media is emerging and they are not in control of it
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.520]  what does it mean when a girl can flip over her laptop and get millions of views that it can be
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:03.440]  circulated 80 million views on facebook dubbed in portuguese and in french which means we're not
[02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:09.440]  just hitting an american sentiment it's a worldwide sentiment i guess globalism being lied to their
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:14.480]  time is running up it's a great time to be lying i'm personally excited about it you got kanye west
[02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:18.560]  i don't care what people think people don't think i like it more than out now that i know he liked
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:22.400]  trump that's why they literally grabbed him and threw him for a week in a mental institution
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:26.640]  when he started tweeting that he liked trump i am that's we went to visit trump and they threw him
[02:40:26.640 --> 02:40:30.400]  in a mental institution i am the biggest i've always been the biggest supporter of kanye west
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:34.800]  matches because i followed his music and i knew as soon as trump came out i i wrote on my facebook
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:38.480]  page kanye is going to come out supporting trump because all he promotes is individualism everything
[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.880]  that he does is against globalism people didn't understand that moment when he took the trophy
[02:40:42.880 --> 02:40:47.120]  from taylor swift it was actually because she didn't deserve the award and she got it because
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:51.920]  they were trying to appease people so oh well they fixed all those awards and that's what he was saying
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.000]  and now i get it and now i get that i was buying into their propaganda myself because i don't really
[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.120]  pay attention to pop stuff right right and i listen to his music so i understood what he was saying
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:03.280]  why am i here if this is all puppetry why am i here why did i show up we all know she didn't
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:08.240]  deserve this award and she didn't um and he never went along with her narrative and he has died on
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:13.520]  the cross time and time again as an expression um to be able to say that to be literally he has no
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:18.960]  criminal record nothing no mental problems he goes and visits trump a week later they throw him
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:23.120]  in a in a mental institution for a week till he's able to get himself out you know the saddest part
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.480]  to me with how long was he in three four days i think it was about a week and the saddest part
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:30.800]  to me was just that the black community he has been so inspiring for all of us and it was sad to see
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.800]  them that easily manipulated and saying oh well you know connie just must be going crazy because
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.400]  he supports trump it's it's all insanity and it's getting more insane and i'm just hoping that with
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:44.240]  my voice adds to the mix people can start to wake up and it makes me happy that you say yeah i had
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:49.520]  connie west wrong because at various times we've all bought into the propaganda you know and that's
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:54.000]  why i try to approach things with sympathy when i go and i meet with uh liberals and i speak so
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.240]  i might try to say listen i was one of you i was one of you a year and a half ago so um and you
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:02.800]  were elements of you weren't you know it's everyone buys into their narrative at some point but
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:06.960]  we are waking up we are stronger together and as long as we have each other's backs the globalists
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:11.360]  are going to lose i feel very strongly about that one of the least racist places you'll be is at a
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:17.680]  real tea party or a trump rally there's still some racists there on both sides but i mean it's just
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:21.600]  the experience and now that people broke them through that wall the media said tea parties
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:25.520]  racists don't go to it as more minorities actually go they're finding out all the love
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:30.640]  and that's what's panicking the global right and it has been unbelievable i i have never seen more
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:33.920]  love and more kindness i gave a speech last night at texas state university to their young
[02:42:33.920 --> 02:42:40.240]  conservatives then when i meet other conservatives and i show up and i speak to them they're awesome

[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:07.760]  half year history of survival shield x2 our flagship product we are having supply chain problems
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:13.600]  and this may be the last batch of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it
[02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:18.960]  actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form
[02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:24.560]  we discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:29.040]  to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:36.000]  there's a market they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells
[02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:40.240]  out hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:46.160]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine

[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:09.600]  victim mentality is not cool i don't know why people like being oppressed so weird
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:14.080]  to see if i've ever heard i love oppression but we're oppressed 400 years of slavery jim crow
[02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:18.400]  which by the way none of you guys live through your grandparents and it's embarrassing but for us
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:25.360]  we love black people wait a second didn't you say that four years ago but i mean yeah but you
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:28.960]  can't vote for the other guys they're racist the african-american community is suffering from a
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:34.960]  poor memory with a healthy spoonful of indoctrination i mean from the time that we are in graceful we
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:41.360]  are told democrats good republicans bad and we repeat that ad nauseam without ever stopping
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:47.760]  and just researching do you want to know why democrats who own the media are working so tirelessly
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:53.040]  to tell you that if you ever vote against them you are going to be waking up one day with clansmen
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:59.360]  surrounding you because if they lost even 25 percent of the african-american vote they would be
[02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:04.800]  in deep trouble all of their globalist efforts would die seriously in fact that's why they're
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:10.560]  working overtime to also marginalize other groups like transgender people and gay people
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:16.640]  they are scaring everybody at every corner the mission is simple guys divide and conquer
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:22.640]  red pill black follower there red pill black on youtube millie weaver has an idea to start
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:28.000]  you know kind of like the five but but not have it be just five people but i think five women
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.160]  and i think somebody like you could probably anchor that right yeah there definitely needs to be
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:36.720]  new media and women definitely need to have a platform a true platform not being told what to
[02:48:36.720 --> 02:48:42.720]  say by producers that have an incentive well i know that's what i want to watch i mean you know i'm
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:46.000]  a guy and it's not just watching girls because they look nice i kind of just get sick of guys
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:51.840]  yeah so it's it's fun to see women's perspectives absolutely and it's an exciting time to be alive
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.920]  and i encourage everybody out there get your voice out there don't be scared to say whatever
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:49:02.640]  you're thinking uh nobody can stop you harvey winestein m&m plus a p diddy solution to nfl

[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:25.440]  mocking everyone from your moral high ground and the next minute bam the world discovers that you've
[02:49:25.440 --> 02:49:33.520]  been covering up for a serial rapist america voted for a misogynist said every actor and actress
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:40.080]  everywhere just after they had got finished smooching up to harvey winestein we know celebrities
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:47.040]  this is different if we've learned one thing from your undying support of woody allen and clinton's
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:53.440]  it's that rape is totally fine so long as it's financed by globalists thank you hailey for being
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:59.520]  a constant beacon of strength hope and determination for me and millions of other young women

[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:13.760]  sniffle the point is that i was really hoping that bill clinton a rapist would be in the white
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:21.280]  house you taught us that woman can be raped so long as it's by your husband this is me holding my
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:26.880]  breath perceiving colbert to pen a musical number on the horrible actions of harvey winestein

[02:50:57.440 --> 02:51:03.440]  former fan i was a little disappointed after years of hearing about how you want to rape and kill
[02:51:03.440 --> 02:51:11.520]  your ex-wife and even your mom calling trump and steve bannon racist felt a little pg like m&m on
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:18.240]  a diet sugar-free shady in fact the only people that should be offended by m&m's diss track is cnn
[02:51:18.240 --> 02:51:24.400]  because plagiarism is a no no racism religion racism racism if you want to see the full video
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:29.120]  it's got about three minutes left it's powerful it's gone viral it's harvey winestein m&m and why
[02:51:29.120 --> 02:51:36.160]  the left can't stop losing by kandace owens known as red pill black on twitter and on youtube and
[02:51:36.160 --> 02:51:41.040]  she's been censored she's been blocked she's gone through a lot but fought back and they've had to
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:46.000]  back off they just want to wear us out and get us to quit uh but kandace i want you to tell
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:50.080]  about your story first because you were already viral before paul kind of you know got you on his
[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:54.400]  show naven all over fox news i've seen you everywhere just doing an amazing job at paul
[02:51:55.600 --> 02:52:01.920]  introducing how the left goes around intimidating youtube personalities that they see a successful
[02:52:01.920 --> 02:52:06.720]  bullying them into joining their cult just like when young college students get to college they say
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.840]  get in here to the dorm the racists are out there the kkk's on campus let us indoctrinate you before
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:17.520]  you go outdoors they're burning crosses they did this in a cyber way to her introduce kandace owens
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:24.720]  for folks oh i mean alex is nothing more dangerous to the left than a young well-educated intelligent
[02:52:24.720 --> 02:52:29.840]  black conservative woman nothing more it's like kryptonite to them which is why they came after
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:34.880]  her immediately after she started getting a lot of attention you know back a couple of months ago
[02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:40.960]  also now with kandace there's a big hit campaign against her which is taking something she did
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:47.040]  like over a year ago this social autopsy website and saying that that's what she's now planning even
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:52.160]  though that was before her whole red pill moment moment total ignorance they don't even know where
[02:52:52.160 --> 02:52:56.960]  she came from they haven't even watched a single interview of hers obviously so now that again they're
[02:52:56.960 --> 02:53:02.480]  trying to hit her on that so whatever this young lady's doing she's definitely well and putting
[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:07.360]  the fright into i'll tell you what they're doing they just want to confuse everything to get her
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:12.640]  off balance i think she needs to respond to it she just needs to respond once she's done and move
[02:53:12.640 --> 02:53:19.280]  forward with how they are losing and how they are pathetic uh paul watson thank you so much
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:22.560]  for joining us my friend and thank you for bringing this young lady to my attention thank you paul
[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:28.160]  all right thanks guys take care there he goes wow thanks for coming into town i'm so happy to be here
[02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:32.720]  great to have you uh you're even more impressive in person it's it's wonderful to have you where
[02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:36.560]  should you start in the few months we've got to break i think you should recap right what the feminist
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:41.520]  cult tried to do to you uh you know in your own words they just thought basically you're a woman
[02:53:42.160 --> 02:53:48.080]  you're reportedly supposedly a minority uh and then you so you belong to them right um absolutely
[02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:52.640]  so long story short i was creating i considered myself a democrat and a liberal about a year and
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:59.360]  a half ago as trump was kind of rising up um i can i was trying to build a product called social
[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:04.720]  autopsy which paul just mentioned and essentially i thought i was creating something that was going
[02:54:04.720 --> 02:54:11.440]  to help stomp out bullying the my passion behind it was well intended but it was totally naive and
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:15.120]  not something that now i know that i shouldn't have done and while i was doing that product
[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:21.760]  i was contacted by these you know self-proclaimed feminists and they basically tried to take me
[02:54:21.760 --> 02:54:25.200]  out the same woman that were saying that they were being attacked by anonymous trolls and the
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.480]  internet were telling that they didn't want to figure out who these anonymous trolls were
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:32.880]  and long story short i figured out that these girls were harassing themselves and it was all
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:37.520]  lie and that there was no movement of white male conservatives that were stalking and harassing
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:44.000]  these girls and when i made that statement the left media came after me and tried to smear me
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.080]  i was literally force fed the right red pill which is why i can call myself red pill black
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:52.560]  you wake up one day and everything that you thought was real was a lie i felt like i was being
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:57.440]  kicked down the rabbit hole and um it was incredibly psychologically challenging to go
[02:54:57.440 --> 02:55:02.480]  through to be honest and then a year later i said i'm in this i'm jumping in this and i'm going to
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:05.680]  be involved and i'm going to speak up because everything trump is saying is true about the
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:12.080]  media and i flipped over my laptop and two videos went viral and it's because i was tapping into a
[02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:16.240]  subconscious people are tired and now you've reached hundreds of millions of people and now
[02:55:16.240 --> 02:55:21.680]  i've seen them demonize you on control corporate media but i've seen you on fox news yeah and so
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:26.800]  now i mean let me guess you walk down the street do you run into more fans than haters oh absolutely
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:31.760]  and especially there's such a movement happening even when i was in LA i was shocked to see that
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:36.160]  there's this young conservative movement that is happening and they're so optimistic and they're
[02:55:36.160 --> 02:55:41.040]  so happy and of course i do get some attractors and some haters that is to be expected i named my
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:44.800]  series the myth of the coon fully understanding that was going to be the first thing that they
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:48.880]  called me um and all i can do is encourage people to be smart and be vigilant because the lies are
[02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.640]  going to keep coming we saw that yesterday which paul mentioned they said that i was like a government
[02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:57.760]  show and that i was secretly going to go back and start to dock children complete live application
[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:01.920]  but that is what they're trying to do turn conservative well that's all they've got people know
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:05.840]  the mainstream media they are hit men okay they go after certain people they are paid to go after
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:10.000]  certain people and they're paid to keep certain people empowered unfortunately with the rise of
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:14.960]  donald trump they've lost and they keep on losing i'm i fully believe what c bannon said that if he
[02:56:14.960 --> 02:56:20.960]  runs again in 2020 his he's gonna win by a way way wider margin because people are waking up day by
[02:56:20.960 --> 02:56:25.120]  day and i get so many inboxes on facebook flooded by black people thank you so much i knew something
[02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.360]  was up i'm i'm feeling inspired i feel encouraged um to come out and say what i believe it and you
[02:56:29.360 --> 02:56:34.080]  know i knew this was shady on campus and i feel like i'm being lied to so it is happening the
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:39.920]  movement has started it is not going to stop when you talk about a reeducation camp in 2010
[02:56:40.720 --> 02:56:44.720]  it leaked and they they said no it's a real document that jones got how did he get it
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:49.200]  and the army's response was a few months later just to release it there was a field manual for
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:53.520]  internment and it talks about social security numbers how to process americans so it's for
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:58.960]  here and overseas and it says we're gonna put people in reeducation camps that don't go with
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:02.880]  the collectivist model during the collapse they were planning an engineer collapse under hillary
[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:07.680]  wow and that's the authoritarian communist term is reeducation camp but when you look at a
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:11.280]  reeducation camp it's where you get a bunch of people in the sports stadium those that submit
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:15.600]  you're taking care of those that don't get beat up and attacked it's a peer pressure thing and it's
[02:57:15.600 --> 02:57:19.840]  about getting you to denounce yourself as bad getting you to also rat other people out well
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:25.760]  that's what colleges high schools and businesses are now great is basically malice style reeducation
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:30.560]  camps and people get off the bus you pay to send them to college they get off and they they're
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:34.560]  scared and they bring them in the professors bring them in scare the hell out of them especially
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:40.000]  minorities and induct them into a cult right then and they were doing that cyber wise with you but
[02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:46.720]  you got wise to it and now are a major titan against them info war's life is bringing you a
[02:57:46.720 --> 02:57:52.640]  breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:57.840]  natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal
[02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:05.280]  and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:10.640]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory
[02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:16.240]  responses they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have
[02:58:16.240 --> 02:58:21.840]  the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:28.240]  symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research
[02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:33.280]  is found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:39.680]  amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[02:59:51.840 --> 03:00:00.560]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:13.840]  and we are back live now entering the fourth hour of my daily transmission it is the
[03:00:14.720 --> 03:00:19.920]  second day of may 2018 i'm your host alex jones we just watched the last 30 minutes
[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:26.640]  you saw kandace owens in studio but back in what december of 2017
[03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:34.480]  now let me explain something here why i did this i don't chase hollywood i don't chase stars i don't
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:40.160]  chase all that our audience hates it i don't like it either we're about building something
[03:00:40.160 --> 03:00:46.400]  outside the system poor basin texas we're about pointing out how it's been used to control us
[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:50.960]  but when kanya west comes out has the courage to go against the system and a call for free
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:56.560]  thinking and gets demonized i get excited and i remember kandace owens talking about how much
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:01:02.560]  she admired kanya west and how she wanted to work with him and how she dreamed to do that at dinner
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:07.040]  on the streets of austin and on my show and owens show and you name it so i said hey we
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:13.520]  ought to re-hear that whole interview in a couple days and they said what's crazy we watched it it's
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:18.160]  all about what's happening now and awakening and challenging the system so i said yeah let's air it
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:25.440]  and then i thought last night i went wait a minute let's doll it up and add some of
[03:01:25.440 --> 03:01:28.880]  the new clips and stuff and not say it's new we're not going to see our audience just say
[03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:35.840]  kandace owens coming up on the show and i even said i bet thought police like ben shapiro whose
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:41.280]  job is to take over the conservative movement and kind of pseudo liberalize it with more elitism
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:48.160]  and more foppish behavior i said i bet somebody like him and others jump on it and say don't come
[03:01:48.160 --> 03:01:53.760]  on the show so we'll start saying that morning she's going to be on what she was in this very studio
[03:01:54.880 --> 03:02:00.240]  in an old interview edited into new interviews and it'll cause a big hubbub and it'll be about
[03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:06.640]  free speech now here's another thing four months five months would buy like 10 seconds i'm like
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:10.800]  why is it kandace been back on she's big on the news i want to hear her take but we're not chasing
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:14.800]  the tail of a story that's not even a big story you break stories we had hundreds and hundreds of
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:20.000]  top news cycle stories i mean we're they attack us thousands of times a week everywhere it's great
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:24.640]  to be infamous it's like i'm the heel in professional wrestling but this is for real the globalists are
[03:02:24.640 --> 03:02:32.000]  pissed but i start text messenger they call her shouldn't call back paul i know who didn't put
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.760]  her on the map she's really smart really beautiful she deserves to be there has a lot of courage the
[03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:39.280]  feminists were bullying her trying to mind control her paul said this woman's incredible
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:44.480]  sort of getting her on and she's exploded that's all i wanted to see somebody that deserve to be
[03:02:44.480 --> 03:02:49.440]  big but then there's the thing where you circle back around and you're like hey come on the show
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:52.800]  you get ignored so paul called her and texted she said well i'm just really busy i'll come on
[03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:57.360]  thursday that was last week well i'll come on monday then no call that's why i decided monday i
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:03:03.360]  said you know let's just rear it then i thought yesterday let's do it this way to then get kandace's
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:08.800]  attention but everybody else is that i don't live and die by having kandace owens on the show
[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:15.200]  info wars paul watson with our huge audience pushed her over the top to get recognized and get what
[03:03:15.200 --> 03:03:20.720]  she deserved and needed just like matt drudge has helped push us it'd be like if i told matt drudge
[03:03:20.720 --> 03:03:24.560]  someday i won't talk to you or you can't link to my stories we're like okay you're mentally ill
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:30.720]  it's a chicken or the egg i'm the chicken she's the egg and she needs to know that that she's a
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:35.360]  chicken now she's gonna have many eggs of her own but it does hurt your feelings when you try to
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:39.920]  invite somebody back on nicely and whoa you work with fox news you're in the fox club you're in the
[03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:45.760]  you know republican student movement they're like oh that's not safe we brought trump the populist
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:50.800]  movement brought trump we brought 1776 we have the tens of millions of viewers and listeners today
[03:03:50.800 --> 03:03:56.240]  we're the ones under attack but it isn't like we're chasing after fox news i'll never forget
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:04:00.400]  when they had fox news say jones wants a show here but we don't want him fox news offered me three
[03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:06.960]  shows i wouldn't even go audition for him it's a lie i'm bigger than limbaugh you name it only thing
[03:04:06.960 --> 03:04:12.320]  bigger is matt drudge and i'm not having a pissing contest so i love seeing kandace all up there on
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:18.400]  tv great outfits hair donnell up like she deserves being treated like a princess that's real progress
[03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:23.200]  that's real power so i thought this is how we'll get her attention where we can get in the news
[03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:28.320]  with you kandace anytime you want we want if if if you think you're gonna get a tack coming on here
[03:04:28.320 --> 03:04:34.800]  but that's what she said in a tweet back to the thought police officer chapiro she said disrespecting
[03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:39.920]  any platform watched by millions is silly talk about enforcers please stop telling me and or kanya
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:46.720]  no or can't or shouldn't advise appreciated commands shut down and this really exposed
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:51.440]  the fake right-wing thought police like that snot-nosed arrogant creature ben chapiro
[03:04:51.440 --> 03:04:58.800]  i'm not a rocket scientist but i know to go out and check the top side to see what they say
[03:04:59.520 --> 03:05:05.120]  and they have talked about for decades that a lot of the mental disorders a lot of the behavioral
[03:05:05.120 --> 03:05:12.160]  disorders a lot of the autism spectrum disorders are in the gut from the diets and vaccines that
[03:05:12.160 --> 03:05:18.480]  trigger autoimmune responses in the stomach that then create major toxicity in the gut causing
[03:05:18.480 --> 03:05:24.000]  toxicity of the brain here's a big bbc report today how bacteria are changing your mood if you
[03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:27.760]  have the wrong ones you're depressed well ladies and gentlemen it's been sold out for months

[03:05:33.920 --> 03:05:38.720]  intestines where these things colonize it and put a slime wall in but the nutrients go through they
[03:05:38.720 --> 03:05:43.920]  get what they want first they colonize you then they secrete toxins in you that cause depression
[03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:49.600]  they can even secrete toxins when they want more sugar this is well known nukem with micho zx
[03:05:49.600 --> 03:06:19.440]  exclusively at info wars live dot com
[03:06:20.560 --> 03:06:24.400]  all right you know i had a bunch of in-studio audience and a bunch of crew here they're like
[03:06:24.400 --> 03:06:30.560]  who's been Shapiro well he's an anointed neocon snot nose who walks around making
[03:06:30.560 --> 03:06:36.000]  richard pearl type faces where he tries to act scary and powerful he just recycles
[03:06:36.640 --> 03:06:41.520]  a bunch of libertarian conservative thought and a bunch of other think tank stuff and i just noticed
[03:06:42.080 --> 03:06:48.000]  he's always criticizing me and always trying to keep people off my show while he makes little
[03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:55.200]  faces like this i mean these are the faces five-year-olds make when they're playing gi joe
[03:06:55.760 --> 03:07:00.320]  so i don't carry some little twitter guy and everything and into himself but he's always
[03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:06.640]  trying to police me and then i say hey come on the show and my god he's been Shapiro i mean he's a
[03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:11.440]  god he doesn't reach 86 million people the week of the election that doesn't matter he doesn't
[03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:15.520]  reach conservatively five to six million actual viewers and listeners today bigger than limbaugh
[03:07:15.520 --> 03:07:21.120]  no he's not being sued by george soros and hillary clinton and being called the dark heart
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:26.160]  no he is the anointed just like a leftist he has this arrogance and so it blew up in his face today
[03:07:27.440 --> 03:07:33.360]  kandace owens was here she wanted us to hire i knew she was a great star i blinked four months
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:37.360]  went by with all the distractions i have and she works with turning point who are great folks
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:41.440]  and is on fox news everywhere and that's wonderful i just hope she doesn't just join the fox club
[03:07:41.440 --> 03:07:49.200]  and become like a collected stamp in their repertoire but she's a star she's got a electricity you
[03:07:49.200 --> 03:07:55.520]  name it i knew when she was on with us a bunch back four or five months ago and that the new
[03:07:55.520 --> 03:07:59.920]  right was like don't have her on she's an operative she's a doxer all this bull i said i want her on
[03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:04.800]  a lot well somehow i blinked four months later she's con me west it's all exploded it's everywhere
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:09.600]  that's great but i know how stories work her coming on now doesn't include us in that story
[03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:15.200]  we're already in thousands of stories a day that don't matter what matters is an audience of focused
[03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:21.120]  people that understand free market and action but to illustrate these right wing gatekeepers
[03:08:21.120 --> 03:08:27.680]  i put a tweet out earlier when ben Shapiro was saying no like Luke Skywalker no it's not true
[03:08:27.680 --> 03:08:33.920]  it's impossible he was criticizing Kanye West in a youtube i came across and watched 20 seconds of
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:37.920]  like last week saying don't trust Kanye he'll stab you in the back he's not perfect he's fighting
[03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:41.920]  the establishment he's breaking out of the mold he's saying be a free thinker it doesn't mean we
[03:08:41.920 --> 03:08:46.800]  endorse everything he does but we go on whose shows we want we talk about we want we're not
[03:08:47.440 --> 03:08:51.440]  coastal elites and most folks on the coast aren't elites but they're the coastal elites that live
[03:08:51.440 --> 03:08:58.160]  there that want to run everything so he said no no kandace no let's scroll down and actually
[03:08:58.160 --> 03:09:07.280]  there it is no no no i make powerful faces i'm in command now facebook youtube and google
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:12.240]  leave me alone let my video spread i'm not censored because i'm anti establishment i'm the mighty
[03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:18.640]  ben Shapiro there's no need to fear ben Shapiro the neocon is here and he'll teach us how to be
[03:09:18.640 --> 03:09:24.560]  intellectual like curl rove does so kandace says disrespecting any platform watched by millions
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:29.760]  in response to him is silly please stop telling me and or kanya no can't or shouldn't advise
[03:09:29.760 --> 03:09:38.880]  appreciated commands shut down but let's go ahead and show if we can now my tweet saying oh look
[03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:45.840]  ben Shapiro crawled out from under his thought police rock with you know this type of anti
[03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:52.960]  free speech position he really ought to be the head of the democratic party i was paraphrasing
[03:09:52.960 --> 03:09:57.760]  ben Shapiro crawls off from under his thought police rock to tell real kandace owens and kanya
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:01.920]  west they should not come on my show shocking authoritarianism maybe they should make ben
[03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:08.880]  the head of the democratic party so bringing up roger stone with what he predicted the so-called
[03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:13.600]  obstruction that they were never going to stop this rogue runaway special counsel that's controlled
[03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:18.240]  by the executive but the media says his god involved in uranium one all the corruption it comes to
[03:10:18.240 --> 03:10:22.480]  a head just like roger over a year ago predicted he's going to cover all that the next few segments
[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:27.440]  then he's going to confront comey at another place there in naples florida coming up the next few
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:35.840]  hours with live feeds at info wars dot com during the war room that's in 50 minutes but man i didn't
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:40.240]  say she was on live and i said kandace out we're gonna have a kandace owens interview today she'll
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:47.440]  talk about kanya and the way the neocons and the left flipped out i knew saying no no no this is
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:53.120]  what they do this is and then and then they say don't have kandace owens on with the same bull
[03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:58.800]  so shouldn't kandace owens just like scott adam said you know i was too busy to come on your show
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:05.680]  last week but so many people told me not to just without me even saying about you that i said i
[03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:11.520]  better do this i mean and again it's not like even i need kandace owens to come on the show wouldn't
[03:11:11.520 --> 03:11:16.320]  be that big of an interview it's always the big thing that's big once you try to follow it it's
[03:11:16.320 --> 03:11:19.440]  always breaking the thing that's big folks it's not covering i want to say congratulations on
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:23.680]  your success hey so wander rule how's it going you know you transcended your critics all the people
[03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:28.000]  trying to demonize you the feminist trying to bully you and mind control you and false flag you
[03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:31.680]  man this is awesome great job paul watson you know bringing you to my attention you're really
[03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:35.680]  awesome but she's like whoa i'm kind of too big people are saying don't come on right now
[03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:40.080]  you know whatever she'll say hey you're already been on watch how i make this the news cycle
[03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:44.640]  it's already all over the news lady and i'm just showing you how it works kandace because you're
[03:11:44.640 --> 03:11:49.920]  smart you're good-looking you got star appeal but i'm teaching you if i want to troll as bad as
[03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:55.600]  trump does i can do it 360 and i decided to start doing it so everybody's got four warning now i
[03:11:55.600 --> 03:12:01.200]  did it very cleanly it's a white troll not an evil troll i did a troll a golden troll where i
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:06.000]  said oh we got an interview with her coming up just to watch what they did i mean this is amazing
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:10.320]  and i love kandace and i love conya and i admire his courage and look how he's under attack he should
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:15.760]  double down and say they found tens of millions of living women of the 80 million the chinese have
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:21.440]  killed hiding in their basements that's millions of and frank's how big is that story nobody's covering
[03:12:21.440 --> 03:12:26.880]  it washington post admits it upwards of 30 million of the 80 million still may be living what kind of
[03:12:26.880 --> 03:12:32.400]  story is that 30 million girls hiding or hundreds of babies found in every trash bin in major cities
[03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:37.200]  in pakistan as they the family stone baby girls to death deciding they don't want them where are
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:42.560]  the feminists on that well linda sore sir says shut up you know to to islamic women that stand up
[03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:47.360]  i mean it's such a fraud all i'm saying is conya's a racist he said stop having a slave mentality
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:53.600]  fight back that's exactly what harry at tugman said she said i freed a thousand slaves the leader of
[03:12:53.600 --> 03:13:00.400]  the abolitionist movement the underground railroad is she races like conya now all these babies that
[03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:05.200]  never fought any of this themselves i freed a thousand slaves i could have freed thousands more
[03:13:05.200 --> 03:13:11.040]  if only they knew they were slaves harry at tugman kandace owens and conya are putting that out so
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:15.200]  what do you think of this my friend the way they charge in trying to gatekeep everything go ahead
[03:13:17.120 --> 03:13:24.560]  well alex i must say i'm i'm very disappointed in kandace last wednesday uh i asked our friend
[03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:29.760]  tyler nixon to go to an appearance that kandace had in denver colorado to ask her to come on
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:35.920]  our info war show the alex joe show that day uh while she was polite she said she was just
[03:13:35.920 --> 03:13:43.280]  much too i've learned in american politics alex you got dates with those that brung ya uh and i
[03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:50.160]  think you helped put this young lady on i agree with you she's got star potential she's charismatic
[03:13:50.160 --> 03:13:56.960]  she's articulate and i like her message but she's absolutely right in her tweet uh one of the things
[03:13:56.960 --> 03:14:02.800]  that aggravates me more than anything else is when people say to you say to me well how can you go on
[03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:09.440]  with alex jones how can you go on info wars but let's make two things clear first of all we reach
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:18.400]  millions of people of freedom minded patriots number two when you go on cnn does that mean you agree
[03:14:18.400 --> 03:14:23.120]  with everything wolf blitzer has ever said you and i that's what mark dies that's what mark dies
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:29.040]  tweeted at him mark dies tweeted at supero and said you go on cnn you go on npr buddy they're
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:33.680]  gatekeepers plus they lie about what i stand for they lie about you they say you're in the nexium
[03:14:33.680 --> 03:14:37.840]  cult due to consulting for one of their businesses for two months i check the records i don't just
[03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:43.040]  believe you and then jones says there's martian bases jones you know it's all lies and so we
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:50.880]  just put up with the bullying but the the reason they do it is because our audience is so large
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:57.280]  because we are the tip of the spear because they know we can motivate literally hundreds of thousands
[03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:05.680]  of people to take direct political action they fear info wars i really hope jones will reconsider
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:11.920]  and come back home i'm not going to say she owes us because she has her own talent but you promoted
[03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:18.000]  her when no one else would and now she's going on to what she thinks are greener pastures when they
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:24.160]  were trying to suppress her with swisper campaign saying she was a doxer and a fraud and a criminal
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:30.480]  we championed her in articles we pushed her over the top and it's fine we just hope she doesn't do
[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:35.520]  that to other people because we don't need kandace owens we have the promisian fire she we hope she
[03:15:35.520 --> 03:15:39.520]  now has it and gives it to other people let's have your skype reconnection breaking up a

[03:21:06.400 --> 03:21:11.440]  turning point usa right off the inauguration they're nice folks doing a great job on college campuses
[03:21:12.640 --> 03:21:17.600]  trying to wake people up but here's the deal the white house watches the white house listens you
[03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:23.360]  listen the globalists are constantly demonizing us they're constantly attacking us for a reason
[03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:28.000]  we're rebooting americana we're promoting things that really makes sense that's why
[03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:33.360]  they misrepresent us that's why they demonize us because they're scared we're the tip of the spear
[03:21:33.360 --> 03:21:37.680]  thanks to our audience and supporters and tv and radio affiliates across the country i saw
[03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:45.200]  roger bleep out let's try to get him back now here's what i want to say about ben Shapiro and
[03:21:45.200 --> 03:21:48.320]  matt one of the producers pointed this out and i actually knew this i hadn't really said it because
[03:21:48.320 --> 03:21:53.840]  i haven't been focused on glenn beck why is ben Shapiro so angry at me why is he always trying to
[03:21:53.840 --> 03:21:58.960]  put me down why is he always talking about how i'm so evil and sounding like some leftists
[03:21:58.960 --> 03:22:03.840]  and telling cana solans of khanye west don't come on his show why is he doing that well because
[03:22:04.400 --> 03:22:08.640]  the folks that took over glenn beck's network about two years ago these multinationalists
[03:22:08.640 --> 03:22:17.760]  they are pushing ben Shapiro to be the head of glenn beck's tv station and he has radio shows
[03:22:17.760 --> 03:22:23.280]  of if uh if glenn beck completely retires due to his issues and so ben Shapiro was going to take
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:30.960]  over the word is the failed mercury network so that's what's happening that's why youtube and
[03:22:30.960 --> 03:22:35.360]  google and all them still let him get promoted and don't censor him and why he calls for our
[03:22:35.360 --> 03:22:40.800]  censorship is because just like glenn beck ben Shapiro is a Judas goat to control the movement
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:46.240]  a neocon so there you go that's what is happening it's super intellectually super smart he's your
[03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:52.720]  leader he's the leader like glenn beck was just like 18 years ago 17 years ago i got approached
[03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:58.080]  well i got a ben Shapiro voice and i got approached and i said we want you to put out
[03:22:58.080 --> 03:23:02.400]  these book deals you'll be able to have a show on fox on the weekend and then it'll be weekdays
[03:23:02.400 --> 03:23:06.640]  you're gonna be bigger than limbaugh you're gonna be better than hannity and we're gonna pay a
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:12.160]  three million dollars a year and then it got bigger and i said no i'm not going to do that
[03:23:12.160 --> 03:23:15.280]  because they said we're gonna have editorial control these were off-record meetings so i can't
[03:23:15.280 --> 03:23:22.160]  release it one of our producers john harman famously heard Rothkopf out of the kissinger group
[03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:25.760]  offered me a bunch of stuff and then get pissed when i didn't take it so i could talk about that
[03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:28.960]  because it wasn't off-record he was on as a guest and started during the break saying i want to
[03:23:28.960 --> 03:23:32.320]  talk to alex off here like alex come join us you should work with us you're part of the super

[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:48.480]  and Shapiro crawls off from under his thought police rock shocking authoritarianism and he's
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:54.640]  like they shouldn't go on because you're awful wow he's not on tv reading a script of what somebody

[03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:34.160]  herpes of glenbeck what is the herpes of glenbeck in my view it has been Shapiro a feted scruffulous
[03:26:34.160 --> 03:26:43.760]  diseased uh viral infection that continues to bloom and bloom and bloom and bloom then Shapiro

[03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:00.560]  now i know that caputo went to that senate intelligence committee yesterday for their
[03:37:00.560 --> 03:37:07.920]  uh uh you know murder board and it was a carbon copy of the house intelligence committee inquiry
[03:37:07.920 --> 03:37:16.000]  nothing new the same old garbage is cooked up by adam schiff and eric swalwell and other lesser
[03:37:16.000 --> 03:37:24.560]  lights in the democratic party now uh poor mike caputo whose lost clients who has had multiple
[03:37:24.560 --> 03:37:32.000]  death threats uh who is being driven into bankruptcy by this inquiry is in with mueller and his gum
[03:37:32.000 --> 03:37:40.240]  shoes right now presumably being grilled about non-existent russian collusion the story of the
[03:37:40.240 --> 03:37:45.600]  new york times that appeared yesterday uh which okay well your phone cut out and i'm sorry it's
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:50.240]  michael caputo that worked on the campaign not kneel caputo so i had a little brain fart sorry
[03:37:50.240 --> 03:37:57.760]  i had a little superior out there i understand uh as we've talked about here at info wars uh
[03:37:57.760 --> 03:38:03.440]  this is a witch hunt if you need any further proof of that just look at the new york times
[03:38:03.440 --> 03:38:10.160]  a story yesterday which is perjury trap after perjury trap in the list of questions that mr
[03:38:10.160 --> 03:38:17.360]  mueller wants to ask the president now we also learned this morning that only days we learned
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:24.160]  that roughly a month ago mueller's uh uh subordinate's threatened to subpoena the president of the
[03:38:24.160 --> 03:38:27.440]  united states sure which is which is his own branch of government they can't do and it's total
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:31.600]  fraud but let me ask you this question right now why doesn't trump do it but agree that it'll be
[03:38:31.600 --> 03:38:38.080]  national televised and that he gets six questions first the first one is on x date the new york
[03:38:38.080 --> 03:38:43.680]  times reports you delivered weapons grade uranium on a secret tarmac meeting in moscow
[03:38:43.680 --> 03:38:50.080]  to latimer putin's agent next question hillary and and in her consorts took over 130 million
[03:38:50.080 --> 03:38:54.320]  from the russians for uranium one and you reportedly according to this report ordered
[03:38:54.320 --> 03:39:00.960]  that investigation stop next question you testified to congress x and now it's been admitted why uh
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:06.880]  comey said this in congress then now he says that either way it's perjury i mean you can annihilate
[03:39:06.880 --> 03:39:14.240]  them and i just say bring them in and give them full war he that little rat scumhead won't show up
[03:39:15.760 --> 03:39:20.720]  well the president needs to understand that he has the power in the authority here that this is a
[03:39:20.720 --> 03:39:25.360]  rogue investigation and that list of questions i know but what would happen if he brought him in
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:28.800]  what would happen if he brought that in he would never show up he said yeah you get your questions
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:34.400]  here are mine and the president should publish his questions for robert bill clinton's butt boy
[03:39:34.400 --> 03:39:40.720]  muhr it's a great idea i think we both understand that mr muhr would never agree to that the only
[03:39:40.720 --> 03:39:46.400]  thing would be better alex is if they want to question you publicly i would love to see that
[03:39:46.400 --> 03:39:52.880]  after all you're a russian bot we know that you uh take orders directly from vladimir putin
[03:39:52.880 --> 03:40:00.720]  everything we do here it in four wars is directed directly from the kremlin so uh this has reached
[03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:07.600]  a degree of absurdity i have taken the position that the president shouldn't fire muhr because of
[03:40:07.600 --> 03:40:11.920]  the political and public relations upper because they built it up it's too late he should have done
[03:40:11.920 --> 03:40:16.640]  what you said early on saying this is a rogue agency you're fired like he was a a nat he was
[03:40:16.640 --> 03:40:22.080]  slapping off his dog's rear end well and then yesterday we saw that a courageous band of
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:28.320]  republicans in the house led by matt gates and jim jordan and others have drafted articles of
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:35.200]  impeachment for rod rozenstein why rozenstein refuses to hand over to the congress documents
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:41.360]  pertaining to the origins of this phony russian investigation so what does rozenstein do he attacks
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:46.880]  the republicans saying he won't be extorted the one who's trying to extort people is rozenstein
[03:40:46.880 --> 03:40:54.080]  and a rogue justice department my only question having known donald trump for 40 years is how much
[03:40:54.080 --> 03:41:00.800]  more of this crap he's going to take this is an illegitimate investigation it is now completely
[03:41:00.800 --> 03:41:06.560]  naked based on this new york time story every one of those questions was a when did it stop beating
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.760]  your wife question exactly i'm not kissing your ass roger because you annoy me a lot when you're
[03:41:11.760 --> 03:41:15.040]  on the regular rush thing every day you got to defend yourself it's just so ridiculous
[03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:19.920]  but i'm just being honest but you're always long term super on target you a year and a half ago
[03:41:19.920 --> 03:41:23.840]  predicted everything that's happened when his lawyers told him no it'll all end you said no
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:28.240]  it's going to build towards obstruction it's a total plan right into the 2018 where he says
[03:41:28.240 --> 03:41:32.560]  you're a criminal now the democrats are in the hill saying they plan to run on impeaching trump
[03:41:32.560 --> 03:41:37.680]  it's here he's got to fight now he's still got the people he's turned the economy around he's got
[03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:44.160]  north korea all this he needs these are an enemy group god almighty he will never have greater
[03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:49.840]  political leverage and support in the country than he has at this moment three percent economic
[03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:55.120]  growth on the cusp of a historic peace agreement in north korea and he's got a stop listing all
[03:41:55.120 --> 03:42:00.800]  these wamps the ones that said beck would beat trump and it's a superhero and all the cowards
[03:42:00.800 --> 03:42:05.360]  stop caring go with your gut swing for the fences we know you're americana we know they're all scared

[03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:06.000]  of survival shield x2 our flagship product we are having supply chain problems and this may be the
[03:44:06.000 --> 03:44:11.680]  last batch of this we have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into
[03:44:11.680 --> 03:44:18.000]  purple gas in the atmosphere and so in our own search to get the purest form we discovered that
[03:44:18.000 --> 03:44:22.720]  oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical
[03:44:22.720 --> 03:44:27.360]  companies and also drug makers they used to make drugs and once they figure out there's a market
[03:44:27.360 --> 03:44:34.000]  they start jacking up the price but we're offering it still 25 off until it sells out
[03:44:34.000 --> 03:44:37.680]  hopefully just like the last time this happened a few years ago it's not an issue and we do get
[03:44:37.680 --> 03:44:43.600]  more but right now we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine

[03:47:41.760 --> 03:47:50.240]  welcome back you're on the alex jones show and i'm roger stone pinch hitting from the field
[03:47:50.240 --> 03:47:57.360]  working around some audio problems i think it was milton burrell the great comedian who said drama
[03:47:57.360 --> 03:48:06.400]  is easy it's comedy that's hard i have been an am a huge fan of nick depolo and recently i was very
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:13.920]  disappointed to hear that his show on serious which i was a near religious follower of was canceled
[03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:20.960]  because nick evidently posted a tweet that some people objected to now this is something i know
[03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:28.640]  a lot about since i have been banned for life on twitter because i heard jake tapers feelings
[03:48:28.640 --> 03:48:36.640]  so i am delighted that now my favorite comedian nick depolo joins us from new york city nick
[03:48:36.640 --> 03:48:45.520]  welcome info wars how you doing roger glad to be here excellent so if you can tell us what went
[03:48:45.520 --> 03:48:55.200]  down if you're able to do so uh last friday i i it was a tweet it was based on that uh that
[03:48:55.200 --> 03:49:02.720]  fresno state professor that female professor uh you know after barba bush died she said she hopes
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:10.160]  the whole bush family dies and barba bush was a racist and blah blah blah and uh so it was a reaction
[03:49:10.160 --> 03:49:17.360]  to that and so i tweeted uh dear dear futures school shooters please confine yourself to college
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:27.600]  campuses campuses specifically the faculty rooms at fresno state and berkeley etc and i left it up
[03:49:27.600 --> 03:49:34.960]  there for probably about uh 10 15 minutes i was getting some blowback so i said man maybe that wasn't
[03:49:34.960 --> 03:49:41.840]  a smart thing and i took it down and and then i went on my way that weekend i was i had gigs
[03:49:41.840 --> 03:49:47.360]  on the road and i told my radio producer about he goes oh you should have left it up there or
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:52.880]  whatever anyways i don't hear anything till monday morning i get a call from my radio agent
[03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:59.600]  and uh he he says i could tell the tone of his voice he was like we got a real situation here
[03:49:59.600 --> 03:50:08.000]  and i knew right away it was the tweet and um next thing i know i'm getting canned from serious radio
[03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:14.400]  and the ironic thing is roger that i didn't even get reprimanded on twitter who has suspended me
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:21.840]  once before for uh wishing barba stryce and dying in her sleep um but who doesn't wish that on our
[03:50:21.840 --> 03:50:27.520]  side anyways so the next thing you know uh yeah i'm getting canned from serious radio but also
[03:50:27.520 --> 03:50:34.720]  here's the other thing roger to be to be honest um my contract is up in a couple weeks at serious
[03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:40.560]  so i'm maybe it was my agent's theory and a few other people's theory that they use that as an
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:48.560]  excuse to to boot me off and um they probably weren't going to renew me because the show was
[03:50:48.560 --> 03:50:54.240]  probably a little too rough for them but i know it was doing good numbers wise but ostensibly i
[03:50:54.240 --> 03:51:00.800]  was fired for the tweet no look i think it was uh a great comedian i know that said political
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:08.160]  correctness is ruining this country uh and he was absolutely right my guess is that they can't
[03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:14.080]  do because you are politically incorrect because you are right of center because you're not afraid
[03:51:14.080 --> 03:51:20.720]  to speak your mind i think i also have a feeling that you're going to surface elsewhere soon because
[03:51:20.720 --> 03:51:28.240]  you are very very funny and this is about comedy now i myself caught plaque over my own comments
[03:51:28.240 --> 03:51:35.280]  regarding barba bush i recounted a story in which she accosted me at a republican reception
[03:51:35.280 --> 03:51:42.000]  after ronald reagan defeated her husband in three primaries i was managing and told me that she hated
[03:51:42.000 --> 03:51:50.640]  me she was inebriated um i was uh uh take your pick i either dropped out of or was disinvited
[03:51:50.640 --> 03:51:58.080]  to a republican dinner in north florida where i was the headliner over my comments perhaps my
[03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:05.840]  timing was bad but i was quoted as saying that barba bush drank so much booze that if they
[03:52:05.840 --> 03:52:12.880]  cremated her her body would burn for three days i said it my timing could have been better my wife
[03:52:12.880 --> 03:52:19.120]  was very unhappy with me but we're politically incorrect here we're not afraid to be politically
[03:52:19.120 --> 03:52:24.800]  incorrect here at info wars so i'm glad to have you today let me ask you this how do you think
[03:52:24.800 --> 03:52:32.320]  the president is doing i think he's he's doing tremendously and in this hall and it is a witch
[03:52:32.320 --> 03:52:38.320]  hunt uh i can you imagine if this witch hunt wasn't going on what he would have accomplished
[03:52:38.320 --> 03:52:44.080]  he reminds me of like a running back with two guys hanging on his back dragging them along
[03:52:44.080 --> 03:52:50.640]  he's had headwinds since he got in there and um look what he's look i mean just the north korea
[03:52:50.640 --> 03:52:58.080]  thing the economy is booming black and brown unemployment at record lows um i think he's
[03:52:58.080 --> 03:53:04.640]  accomplished a ton in the face of all this garbage this frickin witch hunt and and people should
[03:53:04.640 --> 03:53:10.720]  they really should be ashamed of themselves uh the people that believe that this is legitimate
[03:53:10.720 --> 03:53:15.840]  it's been what a year and a half that that would that they've been looking for collusion not one
[03:53:15.840 --> 03:53:21.200]  sign and as you know roger because you're probably a lawyer special counsel they have all the time
[03:53:21.200 --> 03:53:26.400]  and all the money in the world and molla's not going to stop until he finds something or make
[03:53:26.400 --> 03:53:32.560]  something up but this is an absolute disgrace the department of justice has been weaponized

[03:53:42.960 --> 03:53:51.120]  job i wasn't even a huge trump fan before he became president uh but as a politician i absolutely
[03:53:51.120 --> 03:53:57.440]  love his giant balls and he he went to washington to shake it up it's exactly what he's doing
[03:53:57.440 --> 03:54:03.120]  both the left and the right one thing we agreed on for the last 40 years was washington was broken
[03:54:03.120 --> 03:54:07.120]  and then we bring in an outsider and these people are cowering and and trying to do
[03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:13.200]  everything to stop him i i think he's done a tremendous job well next you can call me a lot
