[00:36.800 --> 00:43.320]  we're live my friends thank you so much for joining us as we watch the world inch
[00:43.320 --> 00:50.280]  and then hop and then leap towards a giant military conflict with Iran China
[00:50.280 --> 00:56.000]  and more while the traitorous government that has taken control of our
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.320]  Republic is actually moving our jobs as fast as they can to China a
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.240]  schizophrenic policy but there is a method to the madness now coming up at
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.320]  the bottom of the second hour Charlotte Thompson is or be will be joining us
[01:11.320 --> 01:20.000]  expert on the brainwashing and dumbing down of our Republic she will be joining
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  us and I'll also get her to talk some about her father and grandfather who
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.840]  were sculling bones and she has publicly said that she believes that our
[01:30.840 --> 01:35.520]  hour-long piece on sculling bones is the best report ever done on it she's the
[01:35.520 --> 01:42.040]  lady that of course leaked the information to Anthony Sutton decades ago
[01:42.040 --> 01:45.920]  that first exposed sculling bones what was going on there and since then it's
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.720]  all been confirmed but she showed us even more books documents and things that
[01:49.720 --> 01:53.320]  were internal sculling bones never before seen that interview is posted at
[01:53.320 --> 02:01.480]  prisonplanet.tv Charlotte is or be sculling bones blown wide open we also
[02:01.480 --> 02:06.920]  are gonna have Tyrell Ventura pop in remember Jesse Ventura was on the show
[02:06.920 --> 02:11.280]  last Thursday he was planning to leave Friday or Saturday morning in his RV
[02:11.280 --> 02:17.680]  because he won't fly because of the TSA to drive down through the United States
[02:17.680 --> 02:21.280]  into Mexico and down to Baja for a few months during the coldest months in
[02:21.280 --> 02:29.600]  Minnesota that didn't stop the corporate media and Fox News linked up groups
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.760]  like TMZ to claim that Jesse had been road-raging and stopped by the police
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.400]  going to the airport it was funny because I talked to him the day before he was in
[02:38.400 --> 02:42.680]  Minnesota but they don't care they just said he's road-raging wasn't true they
[02:42.680 --> 02:49.120]  were forced to do a retraction he thought it was probably a sigh up and now
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.080]  they've got you know the the super sniper because you at Fallujah and other
[02:55.080 --> 02:59.960]  turkey shoots any type of uprising you know he enrolls the giant military and
[02:59.960 --> 03:06.560]  they just call him terrorist and this guy has come out and talked about
[03:06.560 --> 03:13.920]  sucker punching Jesse Ventura and then running off running from him but very
[03:13.920 --> 03:21.200]  weird and it turns out Jesse was there at McPee's bar the Navy Seal bar then he
[03:21.200 --> 03:25.560]  was there for an event and I went and looked up articles about it and I saw
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.880]  people commenting who were seals and it were there and said I was there this
[03:29.880 --> 03:33.120]  didn't happen or we would have seen this we would have heard of this so I called
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.400]  Ty last night who's here in the US Ventura son I've worked with on the
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.240]  show conspiracy theory and he hadn't heard of it yet he said what I would have
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.680]  heard about that and and my dad wouldn't say seals deserve to die he said I know
[03:47.680 --> 03:52.240]  that's not true and I've seen Jesse around veterans and others I know that's
[03:52.240 --> 03:57.400]  not true as well very bizarre but I went and looked up this guy turns out he
[03:57.400 --> 04:03.440]  runs a mercenary group out of north Texas they did a profile on him in Texas
[04:03.440 --> 04:07.240]  monthly I didn't read the article I was at my parents last month and opened it up
[04:07.240 --> 04:10.240]  so I've been profiling Texas monthly I thought let me see what's in here and he
[04:10.240 --> 04:13.320]  was wearing like an outfit and a skull hat and all this stuff and I was like
[04:13.320 --> 04:19.880]  man how cheesy 37 years old and acts like a kid wearing a skull hat I mean if
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.960]  you're gonna kill hundreds of people and he talks about no shooting a woman and
[04:22.960 --> 04:26.240]  all this stuff at least don't wear a skull hat pal I mean you ought to be around
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.520]  enough death to not like it it's kind of like when your dad catches you with
[04:29.520 --> 04:33.320]  cigarettes and puts you in a room with three packs of them you know that tends
[04:33.320 --> 04:39.920]  to break you of it okay skull hats I mean it's just the Nazis did that I mean
[04:39.920 --> 04:43.360]  it's getting into death okay we'll see where that takes a society so I don't
[04:43.360 --> 04:47.240]  want to spend a lot of time on this today but Bill O'Reilly had the guy on I
[04:47.240 --> 04:51.240]  knew if this would get big when I called Ty yesterday it's got all the earmarks of
[04:51.240 --> 04:56.680]  a Psyop and the guys got a book out and he's tied into a group militarizing US
[04:56.680 --> 05:03.560]  law enforcement with the Israelis hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for

[06:37.920 --> 06:41.880]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[06:41.880 --> 06:47.520]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the

[09:31.240 --> 09:37.280]  bottom of the next hour now later in the hour I'm going to get into this because
[09:37.280 --> 09:45.880]  it's a great example of a Psyop and it's a mystery and that of course is Bill O
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.360]  Riley last night headline America's most lethal Navy SEAL sniper tells gripping
[09:52.360 --> 10:00.240]  tale about killing savages and decking Jesse Ventura Jesse as you know former
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.800]  governor of Minnesota love him hate him he tells the truth or what he believes
[10:04.800 --> 10:11.200]  the truth is and he he lets the chips fall where they may he's anti globalist
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.560]  war he's anti lying about WMD's he's upset about what really woke him up was
[10:16.560 --> 10:20.720]  McNamara before he died coming to Harvard when Ventura was there as a
[10:20.720 --> 10:25.260]  professor visiting scholar and admitted to him personally that he'd staged the
[10:25.260 --> 10:29.520]  Gulf of Tonkin that's just the way they did things that made Jesse very very
[10:29.520 --> 10:37.080]  upset finally pretty much woke him up but it's a mystery because Jesse was on
[10:37.080 --> 10:40.960]  with his last Thursday he was planning to leave that Friday or Saturday he
[10:40.960 --> 10:45.040]  wasn't sure yet to drive in his RV down to Mexico for a few months they're in
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.600]  the coldest parts of Minnesota winters and when I called Tyrell his son
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.440]  yesterday a filmmaker and said hey have you talked to your dad and he said yeah
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.120]  he crossed into Mexico this morning my mom's cell phone doesn't work till he
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.880]  gets to Baja he's got to drive an hour to a landline just to talk to me there
[11:02.880 --> 11:08.000]  and because he lives literally you know an hour from pavement and and power
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.120]  lines he's got solar you know basically going primitive and I said well that's
[11:14.120 --> 11:18.800]  not good news buddy because I said your dad's gonna want to respond to this it's
[11:18.800 --> 11:23.800]  gonna be big news and I can tell I said it's a Psyop I can tell the way they're
[11:23.800 --> 11:27.600]  rolling it out whether part of it's true or none of it's true this is gonna be
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.360]  all over national television he said what is it I said you haven't heard this is
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.640]  about six o'clock last night when I got a hold of him there he called me back I
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.640]  texted him so you want to call me right now and because I wasn't sure at first
[11:41.640 --> 11:45.520]  when I got home early yesterday I shot the news earlier in an interview and
[11:45.520 --> 11:49.600]  then went home until I started researching the Navy SEAL that's doing
[11:49.600 --> 11:55.440]  this and red flags about 20 of them popped up right away and I can't really
[11:55.440 --> 12:00.080]  with all the other important news do this justice but I'll probably shoot a
[12:00.080 --> 12:04.560]  special report about this not because it's even about Jesse Ventura and and
[12:04.560 --> 12:08.520]  he's my friend and I stick up for friends I don't stick up for friends
[12:08.520 --> 12:13.640]  unless they're in the right okay and when I went and researched this sniper it
[12:13.640 --> 12:18.560]  got really creepy real fast he's part of a liaison group and has gotten awards
[12:18.560 --> 12:24.360]  from an Israeli group that's advising US law enforcement and preparing them to
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.120]  fight domestic terrorist integrates in with the TSA checkpoints with machine
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.480]  guns that were in Florida yesterday he runs a mercenary group out of North
[12:33.480 --> 12:39.520]  Texas for security and sniper equipment for the US military and police training
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.520]  and he's being set up as a new celebrity for this domestic crackdown and was
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.240]  probably told to do this as his test to get into intelligence and other SEALs
[12:51.240 --> 12:56.240]  are heavily involved in intelligence but watching his body language
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.520]  whether there's any truth to what he's saying about Ventura or not the whole
[13:02.520 --> 13:07.680]  way it's packaged as a Psyop to destroy Jesse Ventura that's what I told Ty last
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.040]  night I said you watch they're gonna have this on every big TV show and now
[13:11.040 --> 13:14.840]  what's happening I said this is a Psyop I can see the rollout it's like seeing a
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.760]  Coca-Cola commercial you know it's slickly done the big book from the biggest
[13:19.760 --> 13:24.680]  publisher it's not just about selling books though they're setting this guy up
[13:24.680 --> 13:29.600]  to be kind of like their new little little Eric Prince now but on a smaller
[13:29.600 --> 13:36.280]  stage and as a front guy and man watch after doing the research I couldn't
[13:36.280 --> 13:41.120]  quit researching because I'm involved in it at a certain level this guy up here
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.080]  doing it as a Texan I'm involved in it because I'm friends with Jesse and you
[13:45.080 --> 13:47.680]  know work on his TV show and I've gotten to you know him really well over the
[13:47.680 --> 13:55.280]  years and then it adds to it that I can't get a hold of Jesse and it'll be a
[13:55.280 --> 13:59.480]  couple more days until we can get a hold of him probably because he doesn't you
[13:59.480 --> 14:03.720]  know whenever you got cell phones he's like I hate those things and then
[14:03.720 --> 14:09.600]  there's other stuff when we went out to dinner Jesse and his wife and I after
[14:09.600 --> 14:12.840]  we done a lot of interviews and investigations out in the high desert
[14:12.840 --> 14:18.040]  in a private rocket base that's why we were you know in the Vegas area one of
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.880]  the reasons looking at the private space program out there and you know and the
[14:23.880 --> 14:29.200]  fact of is it a cover for a clandestine government operation do bears do certain
[14:29.200 --> 14:33.360]  things in the woods I mean come on and we went to dinner at like 11 o'clock at
[14:33.360 --> 14:38.320]  night if we were done working all day and he was he was complaining about you
[14:38.320 --> 14:42.320]  know the media and he said if I run for president they're gonna make all sorts of
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.600]  stuff up which they've now done claiming he's road raging totally not true just
[14:46.600 --> 14:54.160]  made up and they had to retract it but you know tiny little retraction and he
[14:54.160 --> 14:58.520]  had the CIA visiting when he was first elected governor and sworn in he came
[14:58.520 --> 15:01.640]  down into the basement they called him into the Capitol there was 23 of them
[15:01.640 --> 15:05.360]  and they wouldn't say who they were but they were CIA and it looked like you know
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.600]  the old lady next door and they were basically assessing him and trying to
[15:09.600 --> 15:13.680]  intimidate him and then he course found out his house phone was tapped and much
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.160]  for the dirty tricks happen and he said Alex I care about this country but I
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.800]  just don't think the enough people want to be free and he said besides you know
[15:21.800 --> 15:26.000]  I have reporters people asked me with no evidence about you you know were you in
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.520]  California or Nevada dancing on a table last year drunk and Alex you know I
[15:30.520 --> 15:34.480]  don't drink because I have to take blood thinner because of my blood clots I've
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.520]  had from wrestling accidents you know when Jesse flies you know he has to put
[15:38.520 --> 15:41.840]  on these things on his legs we didn't get blood clots you know back when I'd
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.240]  fly with him you know I'd seem to you know adjusting them or whatever I mean
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.200]  it's a serious medical issue and he doesn't fly but there they are in the
[15:49.200 --> 15:53.000]  news saying Jesse Ventura had an airport you know running to the airport
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.960]  road raging that was a fake report and I'm already digressing off into this it's
[15:57.960 --> 16:03.320]  just that he talked about how they would probably try to plant fake stories on
[16:03.320 --> 16:09.160]  him and so now it's kind of started and because he did talk to libertarians and
[16:09.160 --> 16:14.760]  others and was considering trying to get the libertarian nomination and it just
[16:14.760 --> 16:19.720]  looks like that the system now wants to try to discredit him and I don't know
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.520]  once we get him on the show or once he says something about this if the guy
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.920]  really did sucker punch him and then run away but what I know Jesse didn't say
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.960]  and what Tyrell says there's no way his father would say because I've talked to
[16:34.960 --> 16:39.120]  Jesse off air before I've seen him in person he got very upset when that
[16:39.120 --> 16:44.800]  helicopter blew up with the SEAL Team 6 on it he gets very upset you know and
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.320]  Terry I there in the National Anthem and stuff and he's really into being
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.360]  patriotic that's why he gets so freaked out by all this and they the way this is
[16:53.360 --> 16:59.480]  all scripted where he's on this show and oh a calder claims you knocked out
[16:59.480 --> 17:03.360]  Jesse Ventura and he's like oh yes and then it looks like it's all scripted
[17:03.360 --> 17:08.200]  when you watch it and he's looking down when he's talking about it and then he
[17:08.200 --> 17:14.360]  goes on Fox News with Bill O'Reilly and it's all brought up and you know he goes
[17:14.360 --> 17:19.000]  through all of this and says yes Jesse Ventura we say the family is here of
[17:19.000 --> 17:26.080]  the of the Navy SEALs killed in Iraq and Ventura's like good they need to die I
[17:26.080 --> 17:34.920]  mean this just it's just amazing and then I went and did some research and
[17:34.920 --> 17:39.280]  found out he was there for an award ceremony he was there in 2006 he did go
[17:39.280 --> 17:42.720]  to that bar there's people talking about photos they took with them you know
[17:42.720 --> 17:46.800]  sign deals how some of Jesse's family was there and I called Ty goes yeah I
[17:46.800 --> 17:50.520]  wasn't there but I know about him going the family would have said something
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.920]  about this I've never heard of that you know somebody punching him and then you
[17:54.920 --> 17:59.480]  know knocking him back and didn't knock him out but then running away because I
[17:59.480 --> 18:05.480]  know my dad didn't say you know he seals deserve to die I know that's not true
[18:05.480 --> 18:10.400]  and so again they're now got headlines everywhere
[18:10.400 --> 18:17.120]  Navy SEAL knocks out Truth or Ventura and then I find out this guy is
[18:17.120 --> 18:26.480]  involved as a liaison to a group run by Dick Cheney and Richard Pearl and I've
[18:26.480 --> 18:29.920]  got all the research right here it's mind-blowing it's on the guy's Wikipedia
[18:29.920 --> 18:36.040]  page too with links to it and that he gets all these awards and that he's
[18:36.040 --> 18:42.840]  liaisoning now basically the training of US police and it looks like he might be
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.760]  well basically an Israeli front to train the police because it's been in the news
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.840]  the Israelis are training police and it's like a foreign government's training
[18:49.840 --> 18:56.640]  our police to fight domestic insurgents and he again he heads up a group for
[18:56.640 --> 19:05.400]  quote diplomatic security diplomatic level security and sniper training for the
[19:05.400 --> 19:09.000]  military and police and he's tied in with all these groups and it's just and
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.600]  then he's got this top publisher coming out and the way they're going to promote
[19:12.600 --> 19:17.080]  the book and sell him as the new hero guy that'll come in and tell our cops to
[19:17.080 --> 19:22.080]  get ready to fight them you know militias basically is this gung-ho Navy SEAL
[19:22.080 --> 19:26.960]  with the record number of kills and then you find out it's Fallujah and other
[19:26.960 --> 19:31.360]  turkey chutes where people dare rise up to occupation when the contractors were
[19:31.360 --> 19:34.880]  abusing and we now know and it's turkey chutes and then I research and he's
[19:34.880 --> 19:40.720]  bragging about turkey chutes about shooting a woman and their savages and
[19:40.720 --> 19:44.880]  he doesn't like folks that try to create fear then I got quotes about how he loves
[19:44.880 --> 19:49.120]  instilling fear and he wears skull hats and black uniforms I mean they're
[19:49.120 --> 19:53.600]  setting him up as as the guy to be the Judas code I guess to teach us that
[19:53.600 --> 20:00.360]  martial law is loving and good under NDA and he's going after Ventura big

[24:30.560 --> 24:35.000]  even know this is true it's just some guy getting awards from Dick Cheney and
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.400]  Richard Pearl and who is helping train our law enforcement to deal with
[24:40.400 --> 24:48.040]  domestic threats and runs a mercenary security firm is now going to sell his
[24:48.040 --> 24:57.640]  book under the promotion of trying to defame Jesse Ventura and say that he
[24:57.640 --> 25:06.040]  looked at the family and said I think the seals need to die just and I've seen
[25:06.040 --> 25:10.520]  so many of these dirty tricks come out of the same people it was the New York
[25:10.520 --> 25:16.400]  Post reporter back with Jeremy Tallis and they went ahead and went to court
[25:16.400 --> 25:21.480]  five years ago four and a half years ago went to court and they called the
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.320]  Secret Service the Secret Service wouldn't lie the New York police did
[25:24.320 --> 25:29.720]  lie on the stand they're there to cover Mrs. Bush giving a speech the
[25:29.720 --> 25:34.040]  president's wife outs they're outside of Barnes & Noble they're out there in
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.600]  front of the police we've got their cameras and a guy runs up with his
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.600]  daughter in a wheelchair and starts ramming and into the we are change
[25:41.600 --> 25:45.080]  people saying don't attack my daughter don't attack my daughter and they're
[25:45.080 --> 25:49.600]  just standing there later it show the security camera stuff showed that all
[25:49.600 --> 25:52.400]  you see is him with the camera and they're running up into him he's like
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.960]  hey don't do that what are you doing stop it so even their you know their
[25:55.960 --> 26:03.240]  video shows it and it was on the news truth or attacks disabled girl in
[26:03.240 --> 26:07.720]  wheelchair like the worst thing they can think up is sitting around going we'll
[26:07.720 --> 26:11.760]  set these guys up we'll have our New York Post people there they'll run with it
[26:11.760 --> 26:15.400]  New York Post had to do a retraction by the way when the trial happened in the
[26:15.400 --> 26:18.760]  Secret Service agent got up and said well I'm not gonna lie they were ramming
[26:18.760 --> 26:23.640]  into them they didn't do anything and boy that judge got upset talking to Luke
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.320]  and others that were in there there's no footage of it and they would have the
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.560]  girl come in in the wheelchair like a big teddy bear in her lap and try to you
[26:32.560 --> 26:39.400]  know they could do something like this to me folks they could you know have
[26:39.400 --> 26:42.880]  somebody in a wheelchair as I'm walking down the street just run into me and say
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.520]  I'm attacking children in wheelchairs I mean this is what they'll do so so
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.600]  they're sitting there they go what do we come up with well we'll have Jesse
[26:50.600 --> 26:55.920]  Ventura says that's good the seals are dying and then he punches him and then
[26:55.920 --> 27:00.120]  runs away you see they know there's not gonna be any report of it so the guy
[27:00.120 --> 27:04.560]  says oh and then I ran away right as his book comes out and he runs a merc firm
[27:04.560 --> 27:09.600]  and he's getting weird creepy awards from I'm gonna pull up the documents I
[27:09.600 --> 27:12.880]  pulled them up last night and forgot to I am with the guys did a bunch of
[27:12.880 --> 27:19.280]  research but I've got some of it here it's just it's just my mind blowing to
[27:19.280 --> 27:25.920]  see this happen but and again Ventura is out of the country so we can't get a
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.360]  hold of him they sure launch this right the perfect day didn't they right as he
[27:30.360 --> 27:36.560]  left the United States and out of pocket but who knows I mean maybe they did
[27:36.560 --> 27:39.280]  get there maybe the guy did punch Ventura and then run off I mean maybe
[27:39.280 --> 27:45.120]  that happened maybe I mean ties says it's impossible his dad wouldn't say that
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.520]  I know him and he wouldn't act like that but but but maybe maybe I mean maybe
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.760]  Easter bunnies are real maybe there are pots of gold at the end of rainbows and
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.280]  leprechauns maybe maybe there are mermaids I mean I don't know I mean I
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.960]  can't say a hundred percent that this guy is lying and again I don't usually get
[28:05.960 --> 28:12.280]  into soap opera type issues like this but this is such a illustration of what's
[28:12.280 --> 28:18.640]  happened to our society and then you look at all the stuff that this guy's into
[28:18.640 --> 28:24.080]  it is just it is just crazy and then I've got all these articles about how
[28:24.080 --> 28:29.200]  they're watching the kids at home the schools are over their laptops beyond
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.880]  1984 just public back in the news and children government to issue bracelets
[28:33.880 --> 28:39.360]  to children to track you even when you're at home that's mainstream news today
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.520]  I'm gonna be covering checkpoints popping up where the government has
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.600]  machine guns and searches people and checks their IDs in Tennessee and Florida
[28:48.600 --> 28:52.520]  again this week they're popping up and in Michigan I mean imagine you're just
[28:52.520 --> 28:55.520]  walking down the street or driving or going in a building and there's guys in
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.600]  full-body armor with German shepherds lining you up and frisking you and
[28:59.600 --> 29:04.000]  checking your IDs bugging their eyes out at you and I've got the footage of this
[29:04.000 --> 29:07.520]  all over the country you pull up and there's state police under federal
[29:07.520 --> 29:14.520]  command all you know in a rock ready stance shaking with fury like they're
[29:14.520 --> 29:20.680]  about to climb in the ring and fight some 900 pound goblin I mean it's like
[29:20.680 --> 29:23.840]  they've been under mind control or something they see a station wagon when
[29:23.840 --> 29:31.160]  the family pull up and they act like yeah yep I just it's like mind control I
[29:31.160 --> 29:35.920]  don't know how I get out of this nightmare how this ends where we just
[29:35.920 --> 29:39.160]  try to go report stuff and there's a guy with a wheelchair ramming and in going
[29:39.160 --> 29:43.320]  stop assaulting stop assaulting and then you learn the guys all hooked up with
[29:43.320 --> 29:48.760]  George W. Bush in New York City and the government and government contracts
[29:48.760 --> 29:55.720]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[33:35.640 --> 33:43.080]  checkpoints he's the guy now trying to take down Jesse Ventura all this will
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.840]  do is probably make Jesse actually be more politically involved he's actually
[33:46.840 --> 33:50.440]  pretty much riding off into the sunset but they don't care that's how they
[33:50.440 --> 33:54.360]  operate sells some books you know say that Jesse's happy Navy SEALs are
[33:54.360 --> 34:00.760]  being killed that is so ridiculous on its face I don't believe it I mean just
[34:00.760 --> 34:04.320]  the fact that he says this now six years later writing a book and it's not in the
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.240]  book but he puts it out I guess the publisher didn't want that in there did
[34:08.240 --> 34:14.000]  they I'm gonna stop talking about that it's just it's intriguing when you start
[34:14.000 --> 34:21.640]  researching something I remember talking to Jeremy Tallis that's his nickname is
[34:21.640 --> 34:25.800]  full names German Tallis and saying okay you're saying they came out of a
[34:25.800 --> 34:31.600]  doorway sort of ramming you with it with a disabled girl in a wheelchair and
[34:31.600 --> 34:35.440]  then and then yelling don't attack her don't attack her over and over again and
[34:35.440 --> 34:39.960]  I had Michelle Malcolm's people behind me screaming kill Michelle Malcolm kill
[34:39.960 --> 34:43.160]  Michelle Malcolm and then leaving with her so I'd experience stuff like that I
[34:43.160 --> 34:46.400]  guess that happened right around the same time actually now go back four and
[34:46.400 --> 34:52.040]  a half years ago almost five years so I understand those things go on and you
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.760]  always know because suddenly it's in the Denver Post it's all over the news it's
[34:55.760 --> 35:00.880]  all over blogs within like 30 minutes with the same talking point and then we
[35:00.880 --> 35:06.960]  released the video showing it's them behind her and behind me yelling it but
[35:06.960 --> 35:11.520]  still the media wouldn't retract till I threatened to sue them because I had to
[35:11.520 --> 35:20.360]  they were defaming me on Alex is the guy that says kill women they're slick
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.080]  ladies and gentlemen and then I finally got the footage about a week later
[35:25.080 --> 35:29.520]  because he had been arrested and stuff and finally saw it uploaded online and
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.880]  it showed he wasn't attacking her but you couldn't really tell because she's
[35:31.880 --> 35:35.880]  ramming in and he's going stop it stop stop hitting me what are you doing you
[35:35.880 --> 35:46.120]  know eat in the camera turns so we've got that going on and then it comes out in
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.200]  court and the Secret Service agents wouldn't lie and said yeah no they
[35:49.200 --> 35:56.960]  attacked him he didn't do that and so you never know what's what's true with
[35:56.960 --> 36:00.600]  all these dirty tricks going on you just see that when something's rolled out a
[36:00.600 --> 36:05.280]  certain way it's got the smell it's got the look it's got the signature all over
[36:05.280 --> 36:11.920]  it and it just illustrates the type of dirty tricks were up against then you
[36:11.920 --> 36:18.280]  find out this guy's training police this country's so gone I mean it is so run by
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.240]  foreign banks and all the fake economic numbers they're putting out and and this
[36:24.240 --> 36:36.080]  latest report put out about how Obama's gonna cut the military that's all left
[36:36.080 --> 36:41.120]  cover Obama increased the overall budget for the military the last three
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.360]  years running it's all smoke and mirrors it's kind of like they claim that they've
[36:46.360 --> 36:50.920]  pulled out of Iraq but 70 plus thousand contractors are there getting paid four
[36:50.920 --> 36:54.160]  or five times with regular enlisted troops are paid or even officers in many
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.440]  cases and that's basically a puppet government over there but they just tell
[37:00.440 --> 37:12.280]  the public the Iraq war is over I mean this is a system that is so corrupt that
[37:12.280 --> 37:24.360]  it openly grows the opium in front of everyone it has the Marines and army and
[37:24.360 --> 37:29.800]  the rest of them guard it and grow it and then put it on aircraft because
[37:29.800 --> 37:35.000]  that's what patriots do and they put that on Fox News CNN BBC with straight
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.920]  faces and I talked to people that defend the status quo and they go well we've
[37:38.920 --> 37:43.240]  got a we've got to help grow the opium or al-Qaeda will get the money and I'm
[37:43.240 --> 37:46.600]  like but you want the cops setting up checkpoints to find drugs that the
[37:46.600 --> 37:52.240]  government grew and shipped in and it's producing 13 times what they were a
[37:52.240 --> 38:02.840]  pre-us invasion of Afghanistan hey our government just put al-Qaeda in charge of
[38:02.840 --> 38:06.680]  Libya on record you understand that and they go yeah well sometimes you got to
[38:06.680 --> 38:10.040]  work with al-Qaeda but I but I've got to give all my rights up because of al-Qaeda
[38:10.040 --> 38:14.600]  and we've got to attack Iran because they're with al-Qaeda even though the
[38:14.600 --> 38:18.160]  White House before this one in the current one have five different groups
[38:18.160 --> 38:24.560]  four of them known al-Qaeda attacking the Iranians inside Iran on record even
[38:24.560 --> 38:29.800]  though our government created al-Qaeda do you understand that do you understand
[38:29.800 --> 38:32.560]  and we're all walking number three in al-Qaeda dying secretly with the
[38:32.560 --> 38:36.280]  Secretary of the Army that's even Fox News do you understand I've interviewed
[38:36.280 --> 38:40.600]  the heads of the US Embassy who were ordered to let Muhammad Atta and others
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.360]  into the country and we're told their terrorism designation as a cover they
[38:44.360 --> 38:49.720]  work for CIA I mean this is in the newspapers I've interviewed the people
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.840]  that saw it happen I've interviewed the lawyer and his wife who you know see the
[38:54.840 --> 38:59.800]  government get the underwear bomber on Christmas Day on the aeroplane a month
[38:59.800 --> 39:04.480]  and a half before the Detroit Free Press had to report it because it was on
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.120]  c-span with the Undersecretary of State saying don't blame us we were ordered to
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.560]  help get him on the aircraft by an unnamed US agency intelligence I mean
[39:14.560 --> 39:23.720]  you can't make this up you cannot make up the magnitude of evil we're facing as
[39:23.720 --> 39:32.160]  a society and it's just so creepy how they've got all these well-meaning
[39:32.160 --> 39:37.600]  idiots that will lie cheat steal do anything as long as you tell them you're
[39:37.600 --> 39:43.240]  the good guy yeah we're gonna grow the opium and ship it out into America and
[39:43.240 --> 39:47.280]  Europe and everywhere else as a scourge on the streets because we're the good
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.480]  guys we're gonna kill Pat Tillman because he's shooting his mouth off against the
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.880]  war you're all gonna get promoted let's frag them but then the Army Coroner
[39:55.880 --> 39:59.000]  would lie and put on there it was homicide he was killed he was shot at
[39:59.000 --> 40:03.880]  three feet away with a m16 set on three-shot burst and later it came out
[40:03.880 --> 40:06.720]  what happened they shot him from a hundred yards away he got behind the
[40:06.720 --> 40:10.160]  rocket he said why'd you do that to me hey stop team stood up they tried to
[40:10.160 --> 40:13.480]  kill him again he got behind there they snuck up on him and shot him in the
[40:13.480 --> 40:19.840]  face I mean the military's full of people if they tell you they'll kill Navy
[40:19.840 --> 40:32.560]  Seals oh oh all this patriotism really I talked to a Navy Seal right here in
[40:32.560 --> 40:40.960]  Austin Texas and his best buddies in SEAL Team 6 and he wasn't killed in the
[40:40.960 --> 40:44.680]  helicopter that blew up in the fake bin Laden raid or the one that blew up
[40:44.680 --> 40:50.280]  packed with 20 plus SEAL members and and and the word is well yeah they know a
[40:50.280 --> 40:55.480]  bomb was on it they think Al Qaeda got a bomb on the helicopter but they but
[40:55.480 --> 40:59.280]  didn't they wonder how did Al Qaeda do that and why did they all get concerned
[40:59.280 --> 41:02.440]  that day because they've never been put that many of them on one of those old
[41:02.440 --> 41:08.560]  National Guard Chinook 1960s era helicopters and they weren't sent out to
[41:08.560 --> 41:12.840]  save a group that was pinned down so why'd the media lie I mean they all see
[41:12.840 --> 41:17.120]  that it's a PR stunt they all knew there were complaints when it happened and they
[41:17.120 --> 41:21.560]  know there was a bomb on the helicopter but Al Qaeda must have done it yeah right
[41:21.560 --> 41:25.800]  they're at the military base Al Qaeda knew that that helicopter was gonna have
[41:25.800 --> 41:32.000]  a bunch of Navy SEALs sardined like you know a game of telephone booth into it
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.120]  and then it was gonna go blow up and they'd have a fake mission you were
[41:35.120 --> 41:39.360]  going on to be heroes for the public back at home kind of like Pat Tillman was
[41:39.360 --> 41:46.480]  charging a hill fighting Al Qaeda going up to the top of the hill
[41:49.120 --> 41:56.360]  just like the SEALs were going to save Army Rangers pinned down and then it
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.520]  turned out oh no it was a resupply effort turns out there was no mission they
[42:00.520 --> 42:03.960]  admit there was nothing they just had get on the helicopter and fly to this
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.480]  point and the helicopter blows up with all of them on board and and the people
[42:08.480 --> 42:13.120]  investigated the SEALs that are alive think Al Qaeda stuck a bomb on the
[42:13.120 --> 42:18.240]  helicopter come on guys you're so tough you're so mentally tough you got it all
[42:18.240 --> 42:24.040]  together but you're so hyped up in this little cult of serving the New World
[42:24.040 --> 42:28.520]  Order that you don't see you're used like garbage our military you can see
[42:28.520 --> 42:32.120]  what you wanted about it but pre-1990 they wouldn't let anybody use the plated
[42:32.120 --> 42:39.760]  uranium nobody because it's a death sentence for everybody that uses it you
[42:39.760 --> 42:43.520]  might die in a year you might die in 20 but let me tell you it's about like
[42:43.520 --> 42:46.640]  smoking 10 packs of cigarettes day and drinking a gallon of Jack Daniels I
[42:46.640 --> 42:49.960]  mean it's gonna hurt you bad
[42:52.400 --> 42:57.320]  and I mean I know the troops I mean I know the people I've got family and
[42:57.320 --> 43:02.720]  and who's got family and folks I know who've been sick and record numbers
[43:02.720 --> 43:08.200]  dying and birth defects and also what if Feluja has 14 to 16 times normal level
[43:08.200 --> 43:13.560]  of cancer and birth defects and then the troops come back especially from
[43:13.560 --> 43:17.040]  Feluja where they blew the whole place up with it and then they're all dead and
[43:17.040 --> 43:22.160]  dying and then you got to hear you know people going yeah we care a lot about the
[43:22.160 --> 43:27.960]  seals so I I decked out Jesse Ventura you don't talk bad about the seals really
[43:27.960 --> 43:31.280]  they got you guys using weapons systems they're gonna kill you dead in a hammer
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.080]  but you don't want to hear that you're young and tough and you can handle it
[43:35.080 --> 43:41.200]  and government wouldn't do that to you oh yeah do you hear Doug Rocky Vietnam
[43:41.200 --> 43:48.840]  veteran combat right through service for decades physicists other PhDs writing
[43:48.840 --> 43:55.720]  the book on DU most of his team dead he's had 30 something surgeries this is
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.280]  a fact that the system doesn't care about you it's a fact that they could
[44:00.280 --> 44:04.200]  care less and going back to the Romans they learned how to give him spree decor
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.960]  they learned how to say you're the elite of the elite so they break their backs
[44:07.960 --> 44:15.840]  more than anybody and then the special you know cohorts the more elite cohorts
[44:15.840 --> 44:21.120]  and they didn't really have medals then it was what staff and what eagle they got
[44:21.120 --> 44:25.120]  to carry and they would do anything they'd march barefoot you know for three
[44:25.120 --> 44:29.800]  days through snow because they had the you know the top signals the top logos
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.720]  the top banners and flags and pennants that they were carrying and Napoleon
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.240]  wrote about how men would give their lives and throw themselves on the bayonets
[44:39.240 --> 44:43.520]  for the little pieces of metal and cloth he was the one that really deployed
[44:43.520 --> 44:52.440]  medals medals I mean it's a joke it's a joke when those medals are for
[44:52.440 --> 44:59.040]  empowering a corrupt empire empowering a corrupt New World Order while your own
[44:59.040 --> 45:04.280]  homeland using a fascist Nazi term by the way this black uniforms the Nazi
[45:04.280 --> 45:10.720]  terms they're adopting all the fascistic regalia all the symbols they're not
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.600]  hiding from it and then they take the dead and dying veterans death benefits
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.200]  they've paid for and oh that's not patriotic you know don't talk about it
[45:20.200 --> 45:23.680]  dr. Doug Rocky didn't want to talk about on there but I got him to and he gets
[45:23.680 --> 45:26.920]  all these hundreds of calls a week and he calls the local VA they won't help he
[45:26.920 --> 45:30.280]  calls the local veterans of foreign wars he calls the local you know veterans
[45:30.280 --> 45:34.120]  groups and they just go nope we're not gonna help take that veteran to the to
[45:34.120 --> 45:37.760]  the to the VA well he's in a wheelchair now he's been back from Iraq for two
[45:37.760 --> 45:42.720]  years and you know he's a staff sergeant and he's bleeding you know out of his
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.320]  gums and out of his hind end and I can't take all these people I'm taking to
[45:47.320 --> 45:50.520]  these guys three or four days a week and I'm real sick myself can you just give
[45:50.520 --> 45:53.280]  me some people to help me the VA won't come pick them up they can't they're
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.120]  overwhelmed and I heard of this on the news today that there's so many troops
[45:57.120 --> 46:01.000]  coming back now the VA can't handle it and you call the veterans groups up
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.400]  because they're all the guys that were you know in the military when there
[46:03.400 --> 46:06.200]  weren't wars or whatever and they're all just kind of sitting back drinking
[46:06.200 --> 46:10.280]  beer they're like you want us to go take somebody into the into the VA or try to
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.120]  get a medical treatment no I'm gonna drink some beer and sit there and call
[46:14.120 --> 46:19.160]  people rag heads and Hodges and watch Fox News
[46:20.320 --> 46:25.880]  I saw the comments on the New York Post and places and it's all like how
[46:25.880 --> 46:31.840]  great he's right they are savages kill them all they're gonna kill your pension
[46:31.840 --> 46:34.120]  fund they're gonna kill your bank account they're gonna kill the value of
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.000]  your dollar they're gonna take your house when it's paid for they're gonna
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  bring you into a hardcore depression you think the new order just gonna kill
[46:43.000 --> 46:47.560]  some brown people under 15 years of sanctions a million of them that starved
[46:47.560 --> 46:50.800]  to death or died from medical issues I've talked to the real troops that came
[46:50.800 --> 46:56.280]  back they said most those people are so debilitated that every once in a while
[46:56.280 --> 47:00.320]  if you killed their family they'd go dig up a AK-47 and try to shoot you and
[47:00.320 --> 47:05.320]  then it's called an insurgent all the disease the sewage running down the
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.440]  streets the people starving to death and anytime the contractors come in and
[47:09.440 --> 47:13.800]  later confirmed and mow down a bunch of innocent people it's now been confirmed
[47:13.800 --> 47:17.400]  in federal documents blackwater people running around the streets on cocaine
[47:17.400 --> 47:23.080]  naked shooting up apartment buildings and cars and we have videos of similar
[47:23.080 --> 47:28.280]  stuff and then the people get mad and rise up against it and so the entire US
[47:28.280 --> 47:32.720]  military lines up and levels the city and they got snipers racking up their
[47:32.720 --> 47:36.520]  record kills what will yet because in World War two in Vietnam they're
[47:36.520 --> 47:43.280]  actually fighting an enemy that shot back actual soldiers actual warriors it
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.000]  wasn't a bunch of starving people running around with with drones and
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.720]  sword robots going in and and and just carpet bombing everything and heavy
[47:51.720 --> 47:57.120]  artillery leveling and what maybe a thousand people out of tens of thousands
[47:57.120 --> 48:03.000]  decided to stand up and it's just anybody moving in an area shoot them it's
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.640]  like oh it's legendary we can sit here in an office building and shoot people
[48:07.640 --> 48:14.080]  all day oh it's so manly meanwhile the you don't care about those Hodges well
[48:14.080 --> 48:19.400]  the New World Order doesn't care about you and so and I know you're listening
[48:19.400 --> 48:23.720]  and laughing right now you're 30 years old or whatever or you're 25 and you
[48:23.720 --> 48:27.160]  know some of your buddies are kind of sick but whatever that's what they signed
[48:27.160 --> 48:29.600]  up for and you know the VL take care of him you don't know why your buddies
[48:29.600 --> 48:32.960]  kidneys are failing or others blood coming out of his gums or yeah your

[48:37.440 --> 48:42.480]  got holes in her heart and her you know and it's got only got half a kidney but
[48:42.480 --> 48:46.960]  you know what so what that shut up Alex Jones you're not patriotic I know you
[48:46.960 --> 48:51.080]  don't care about anybody because you're a tough guy but few years down the road
[48:51.080 --> 48:56.280]  you're gonna go in and get diagnosed with that cancer when you're 35 or 40 and
[48:56.280 --> 48:59.120]  then they're gonna cut your chest open and go in there and remove one of your
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.240]  lungs you get to have all that fun or because it really gets the lungs you
[49:03.240 --> 49:07.920]  guys are really looking forward to some lung cancer those little Hodges got to
[49:07.920 --> 49:10.920]  die real quick of course now they get to have all the deformed children and
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.600]  people make jokes about that I've seen the websites that post the photos of the
[49:14.600 --> 49:17.760]  horribly deformed children I see people making jokes about them going good let
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.440]  the Hodges die oh well your kids are gonna be popping out like that too and

[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:39.720]  begins because of too much snow piling up or when you put a piece of paper on to
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.680]  a hot stove and then it finally browns and then reaches flashpoint at a certain
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:49.960]  Fahrenheit and flashes into flame now in historical perspectives a couple years
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:58.320]  is like a millisecond and we are now entering the flashpoint where the paper
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.480]  ignites before the Constitution was browning and cracking now it's caught
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.640]  on fire and the damn broke the tyranny's flooding in and the government's like

[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.560]  that's from ten years ago in road to tyranny but now there's new ones out I
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:42.240]  mean it's everything they were beta testing is now going going mainstream
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.160]  right as they implode the economy and give us fake numbers that you know we're
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.920]  in the best recovery ever and everything's milk and honey sorry have
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.880]  those businesses you used to do business with a shutdown and most the
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.200]  restaurants used to go to a shutdown and those factories are shut down and
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.840]  sorry your social security won't buy what it did before but there's no inflation
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.440]  though and just everything is wonderful and Obama is announcing that he is
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:09.840]  gonna cut the military because we don't have money and what they are cutting and
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.960]  it's small cuts oh hundred billion here oh my gosh that's huge and they got a
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.500]  trillion 100 billion on budget another 800 to 900 trillion off budget 800 to
[01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.480]  900 billion off budget that's right at two trillion oh so you're gonna cut a
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.360]  hundred billion oh it's so massive and the money they're cutting is just going
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.040]  to bail out the mega banks it's just it's just direct taxation to them and
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.920]  that you know they're saying we can no longer fight two wars simultaneously
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:45.680]  total bull this was all planned meanwhile they're using proxy wars against China
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.480]  and Russia while the very same banking interests are building up China and
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.520]  Russia you're like well how does that work they fund the Muslim extremist they
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.080]  fund the Chinese Communist they fund the Russians to a great extent they fund the
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.360]  more radical groups in Israel that's like those TV ads demonizing Ron Paul where
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.440]  he says Israel founded Hamas I mean they've had debates in the Knesset saying
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:14.480]  people ought to be arrested for doing it whoever did it in the 70s was Mossad and
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:18.840]  Shin Bet but that's Jerusalem post Rods
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.240]  Bull Street Journal I showed it to you but they're counting on you being ignorant
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:29.800]  it's not America against the Muslims or America against the Chinese or it's not
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.040]  America against England you know when I criticize the corruption of the British
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.400]  Empire system and its control over the US to a great extent I'm not saying the
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.800]  Brits are bad people same thing with Israel it's not that the Israel runs the
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:47.640]  US or the US runs Israel the same globalists run both the same globalist
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.840]  run China to a great extent and you're like well then why are they trying to
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.680]  start these wars because the wars get everybody deeper in debt and the Chinese
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:03.480]  can use wars or conflicts to crack down their public the Mullahs won an attack at
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.840]  many levels because they believe they'll get more political power out of it in
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:13.640]  Iran the name of the game is chaos because that gives criminal enterprise
[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:19.440]  more control now I've got incredible I've got to get to this economic news I've
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.520]  got to get to the geopolitical news I've got to get to the lawless Obama regime
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:29.240]  and all Rush Limbaugh they're all freaking out over the fact that he is
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.600]  power-grabbing and doing recess appointments nobody's ever done at
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:37.120]  this level because the Senate's you know not in recess he didn't bring them
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.680]  forward then they're saying it's unconstitutional show is Obama launching
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.600]  the Libya war without Congress yeah that's the whole point but you're also

[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:15.040]  well everybody finds a mystery to be intriguing and that's why I probably
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.080]  spent so much time on it in the last hour when overall we have a lot bigger
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:23.560]  issues to deal with my friend Jesse Ventura is out of the country just drove
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.440]  into Mexico yesterday that's brave and his RV and they can't get him on his
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.920]  wife's cell phone that doesn't work down there till he gets to Baja. To respond
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.840]  to Bill O'Reilly Fox News newspapers all over the country saying that the most
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:46.240]  lethal sniper Navy SEAL six years ago in 2006 sucker punched Jesse Ventura and
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.440]  then ran from him I mean that's so pathetic it makes you want to believe
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:55.280]  it but you can't believe that he said I'm glad Navy SEALs are being killed
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.160]  that's tailor-made to make Ventura look bad I know him well his son knows him
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:02.680]  really well when Tyrell saw that and I called him and told him about yesterday
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:06.320]  he couldn't believe it the problem is he's in jury duty he can't say what the
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.880]  trial is but it's pretty important there in Minneapolis and so they're
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.200]  supposed to go at lunch right now he's supposed to have called in but his phone's
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.360]  off they're still in the trial I had to move Charlotte-Israby back 30 minutes
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:23.280]  with really important information on skull and bones and it's tie-in to how
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.840]  our entire education system was set up of course her father and grandfather were
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.320]  skull and bones she was they had a policy Department of Education she's gonna
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.160]  be joining us on that by the way I know you keep telling me Jaren that she
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:37.000]  sent us a transcript of the video we did with her well you asked Kurt to make
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.520]  sure he posts that right now or to see if that's been posted okay great something
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.240]  like a headline like Charlotte-Israby blows skull and bones wide open that
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.360]  that's a good transcript with the video report for everybody I know it's been
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.440]  out for a month or so and has a few hundred thousand views but first seen
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.320]  my prison planet dot TV viewers but it's important and Charlotte's really proud
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.600]  of the hour-long documentary we did for prison planet dot TV she thinks it's
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.320]  one of the best works out there she's the lady that released the secret
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.200]  documents on skull and bones in the 80s to Anthony Sutton she didn't want the
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:16.640]  credit but that's what is best-selling book the secret establishment okay okay
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.720]  okay so it's a transcript on education not on the skull and bones yeah put them
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.800]  both out together yeah put them both out together that's good and then we'll get
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.040]  her on I don't know when we're gonna get tie-on because they meant to push her
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.280]  back even more because this is important on the Ventura deal I don't even know
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.200]  since this morning when I talked to him again if he's talked to him because I
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:40.800]  want to know I mean Jesse if he said it he's all about saying what he thinks you
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.880]  know this stuff really happened I've talked to folks that have called down to
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:48.240]  the Navy Seal bar they said nobody knows about that that that would be well
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.040]  known you wouldn't keep that secret at a big public event this supposedly
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.720]  happened we're gonna find out because you know they're saying that he went in the
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  bar and said I'm glad Navy Seals are dying and the guy punched him knocked him
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.880]  down and then and then and then the guy ran away from him I mean if that's true
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.320]  I mean the guy might be telling the truth I don't want to say he's a liar
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.240]  because I don't have proof of that but it just doesn't make sense but the part
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.600]  about saying I'm glad Navy Seals are dead that has Cy operating all over it then
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:21.000]  we looked into this guy turns out he's trained in police for quote to fight
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.920]  domestic extremist and setting up kind of a Halliburton style diplomatic
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:33.600]  protection group so and is rolling out a book he's selling right now so I wanted
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.720]  to get Ty's take on that but his phone is still turned off and can't get out of
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:43.520]  the courtroom obviously so we'll see what happens but I cannot wait to get
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.520]  Ventura on as soon as we're able to get in touch with him when he gets to the
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.440]  Baja on the next day or two but I remember Ventura telling me off air and
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.280]  on-air last week he's well that was a few weeks ago he was on about the
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.720]  disinformation when they claimed he was road raging and tailgating and the
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.680]  cops pulled him over because he had to go catch his commercial flight and I'm
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.400]  like this happened yesterday and he goes yeah we talked yesterday you called me
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.760]  in Minnesota he goes the point is is I got my lawyer on this you know they say
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:17.400]  I'm out road raging and just making it up on TMZ and Fox News and TMZ removed it
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  Fox News removed it not really a retraction so so road raging two weeks
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.720]  ago not true now he says he's glad Navy SEALs are dead and and it's getting you
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.440]  know knocked to the floor at a Navy SEAL bar when Jesse doesn't drink for
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.160]  decades and I can have a testament to that but I told you they did this to us
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.160]  and we are changed they involve me in the articles as well the New York Post
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.600]  same crew doing this now Rupert Murdoch who's known for running wire
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.800]  tapping and dirty tricks and running police and you name it and that's the
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.920]  systems blackmail on him now to endorse Obama because he's got the fast
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.200]  and furious on them that's part of the power structure kind of blackmailing
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.360]  each other but you know oh we they don't like we are changed they just have
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.520]  people with a young girl in a wheelchair ram them into we are change
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.120]  people and then charge them with assault and then the Secret Service gets on the
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:10.520]  stand and says actually he didn't assault them they ran into him on purpose
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:17.520]  but they had the headline truth or a tax disabled girl in wheelchair now the
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.880]  headlines are truth or Ventura knocked out by hero SEAL right when they knew
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.960]  Ventura was driving into Mexico and it said publicly people can't get a hold
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:30.520]  up until he gets to Baja which is an hour from pavement that doesn't have
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.240]  telephone as well so Jesse Ventura leaves the country you know his phones
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.560]  are tapped he's been visited by the CIA before and boom right as he drives off
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.600]  all the guy pops up that's training our police to deal with domestic extremist
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:51.120]  and is a part of this group set up by Richard Pearl and Dick Cheney
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:59.160]  National Security Affairs Institute and well he's gonna help train our police
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.920]  to fight the domestic extremist by the way I'm gonna try to get this Chris Kyle
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:14.800]  on the show just just just incredible but again as soon as soon as Tyrell is
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.240]  able to get out of get out of there we'll get him on or we'll just get
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.840]  Charlotte on and then when he calls him we'll show a brief report and continue
[01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:28.720]  there some of the other news I want to get to I want to analyze the way they
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:36.840]  make it a joke but at least they are covering it and that is Comedy Central
[01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:40.120]  I meant to play yesterday but I didn't coming out about the NDAA and then it
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.000]  allows the secret arrest of citizens and for citizens to disappear into dungeons
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.680]  and now this is the essence of tyranny the essence of corruption and then we
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.840]  just have all these articles coming out now it's not just Florida DHS officers
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:02.880]  armed with semi-automatic setup unannounced ID checkpoint we're gonna
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.480]  be getting into more of that but the martial law rollout is happening but
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.400]  as Jesse Ventura vindicated by warning about military on the streets is Ron
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:16.120]  Paul and I know we're demonized for talking about what's now happening now
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:23.160]  shifting gears to filmmaker director TV producer Tyrell Ventura son of Jesse
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:28.960]  Ventura the only guy in the US his mom and dad obviously you know ties here in
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.440]  the United States Jesse went into Mexico yesterday and he hasn't been able to
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.120]  raise him yet at least since this morning he just got out of jury duty have
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.240]  you have you been able to talk to your dad have you found anything out yet and
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:47.000]  what's your take on what this gentleman who has a book that came out two days
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.920]  ago is saying about your father Tyrell no I have not been able to talk to my
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.360]  father at all like I said he's traveling in in Mexico right now and
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:01.800]  there's obviously no cell phone you know cell phones don't work in the desert
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.200]  and things like that so I have not been able to I get all of them to ask him
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:11.440]  about the accusations and the incident that this guy is referring to
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.360]  obviously I have you know that most respect for for this man service
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.920]  record and things like that I want to be clear that I you know I don't know
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:22.080]  anything about the story that he's talking about I've never heard anything
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:29.520]  about that it certainly doesn't I've never ever heard my father ever make
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:36.080]  any kind of remark about wishing American soldiers that I have never heard
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:41.960]  he'd never say anything in that nature so it does sound pretty pretty ludicrous
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:48.080]  me well also I did some research he was there at that at that Navy seal bar
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.400]  reportedly with hundreds of people and it's a big place there on the beach in
[01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:56.640]  2006 he was speaking to a Bud's class and I saw people commenting on the
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.840]  different seal sites and stuff saying they were there the whole day and that
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.040]  this never happened and then even if they weren't there this would have been
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.200]  talked about this would have been known and there's people posting photos they
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.000]  took with your dad there that day that was when he had the Johnny Depp you know
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.520]  pirate you know a beard and everything I mean it's so I mean it would be pretty
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.680]  shocking to me that if somebody were to assault my father in a bar that we
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.760]  wouldn't have heard about it sooner than you know however many oh six to six
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.280]  years seven years later you know it seems pretty pretty wild that's an
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:36.480]  incident like that would go down the way he said that we wouldn't have you know
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.400]  we wouldn't have heard about it in 2006 or 2007 or two years weird that's
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:45.000]  something of a violent nature the way he's describing by the way I met your
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.400]  father for the first time one week after when this incident happened because
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.720]  that's when they were there for a Congressional Medal of Honor winner seal
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:57.160]  who died in Iraq I met your father one week after this event and I did an
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.760]  interview with him I could and it's on video I can testify there was not a mark
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.640]  on his face and he was probably the best shape he's been in a while that's
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.720]  probably how he blew his hip he'd been running every day he was very thin in
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.920]  good shape tan in the interview no bruises no nothing one week after this
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:18.760]  incident I never heard about it like I said I haven't been able to talk to
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.320]  dad directly or anything like that so I don't know what his take is on this yet
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:28.800]  all I can all I can say that I've never heard of it before it's my best
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.400]  recollection I'm pretty sure that if my dad was punched in a bar I would have
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:39.440]  heard about it you know I'm pretty sure I would have heard about that but I you
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.880]  know I obviously it's well documented his feelings about the Iraq war and our
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.960]  involvement in that obviously it's well document about his feelings about you
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:52.120]  know President Bush and Vice President Cheney so that side of the conversation
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.520]  that this guy supposedly heard you know I can say yeah I mean I've heard of not
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.240]  in that particular incident but I have heard my dad's feelings on that as opposed
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:05.640]  to my dad ever saying anything about wishing American soldiers dead or saying
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.600]  they deserve to die or anything of that nature it does not sound like my dad and
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:15.760]  then it doesn't sound like anything he'd say well I have seen him when Seales
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.760]  had been killed I talked to him privately he was very upset you know with
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:24.880]  the camaraderie and everything he doesn't want the wars if he doesn't want
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.880]  anyone getting killed he doesn't want soldiers getting killed he doesn't want
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.920]  civilians getting killed he doesn't want anyone getting killed and so it was
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:36.840]  like I said it doesn't sound like him well he's always so respectful of
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:39.560]  military people in airports and stuff and he always thanks him for their
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:43.360]  service and says you know I hope we can get you guys home and out of harm's way
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.600]  and you know he's worried about DU and I've seen him when this when the Seales
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.960]  helicopter blew up the mysterious still team six situation he was he was upset
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.880]  when I talked to him privately and I mean just imagine oh here's their family
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:59.520]  please stop it sounds like a scripted to make him look bad here's the family
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:06.960]  Jesse governor please stop talking bad about the Seales no I'm glad they're
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.960]  dead I mean that that is just that I do not believe that it's still out of
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.320]  character of him that I can't I can't imagine that that's what happened like
[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.600]  I said I haven't talked to him so I have no idea but it just seems so out of
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.920]  character for him to wish harm upon his his fellow SEAL team members it doesn't
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:29.600]  make any sense now it's interesting this guy's got a book out right now and I
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.800]  mean that he would announce this now that the book came out and that he would
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.240]  say that he punched him and knocked him down but not out and that he then ran
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.040]  away and that the SEALs teach him to punch and run away I mean that sounds
[01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:47.440]  like a joke I you know I like I said I don't I don't know much about the guy
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.800]  himself obviously the better and you know I don't it doesn't I mean you know
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:56.940]  I don't like I said I mean that's part of the what he's described doesn't make
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:21:02.360]  any sense to me at all you know so I don't know you know reportedly some of
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.800]  your dad's in terms of talking about like whether to get trained to punch and
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.840]  run away or not I I I well I'm not a Navy SEAL I don't know it's ridiculous well
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.120]  sure you obviously throw a hang grenade and run away but the point is well look
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.880]  look look what is you know your dad by better than anybody you you you've worked
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.040]  with him as an assistant and then as a director but your own films you've made
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.280]  separate from that you're a producer on the TV show everything great great
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.400]  cinematographer everything you work with your dad constantly and you and I know
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.080]  you don't probably want to repeat what you told me last night but you know your
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.920]  words were this is pure BS after you saw the first video and correct me if I'm
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:41.800]  wrong but then you went on to say I'm not looking forward to telling my dad
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:46.360]  about this well of course Bob my dad never likes to hear people speaking ill
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:51.480]  of him but you know I mean nobody does you know I mean I you know he just is
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:56.000]  getting down to Mexico he's you know gonna kind of recharge you know you
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.960]  hate to deliver bad news like this but oh somebody's saying you know negative
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.640]  things about you and a really you know saying that you were involved in a violent
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.400]  altercation and that you know you were wishing harm to the servicemen you know
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:11.200]  he doesn't want to hear that man I know that that's really upset him when he
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.120]  hears things like that doesn't this sound like about them when he hears things
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.360]  that are potentially false you know he doesn't like it when people speak
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:24.160]  falsely about him now now it could be like we talked last night maybe part of
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.840]  it's true maybe they did get in an argument maybe I mean I mean that part
[01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.960]  perhaps could be true we don't know because Jesse Ventura I don't know I
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.000]  haven't talked to him so I don't know but I mean yeah I mean my dad is not
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.400]  afraid to voice his opinions about current events and things like but there's
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:43.120]  no way he would say especially in front of a family I think seals deserve to die
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.800]  I mean that is clear bull it doesn't sound like him at all and then you know
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:54.680]  that does not sound like my father yeah so but again I haven't talked to him
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.160]  directly so I mean I don't you know I don't even know you know I mean as soon
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:02.960]  as I get word about you know from him you know regarding what this guy's saying
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.600]  you know obviously I'll know more about it then but I mean right now like I it
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.360]  just doesn't sound like his character doesn't sound like him well time we
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.560]  appreciate you taking time out of jury duty right now to do this and then the
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.160]  few minutes you've got for lunch we only got about five minutes left here with
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:22.680]  you but but but obviously this is now on the heels of two weeks ago I just so
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.360]  happy when we talked to him like every few weeks to talk to your dad you know
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:31.480]  about coming on before he left town he said yeah call me next week I'm talking
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.480]  to him in Minnesota I call your Minnesota number I talked to him then the next
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:42.400]  day it's on the news that I hadn't even seen it yet that he's road raging he
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:47.000]  calls into the show to say I'm here in Minnesota they didn't really retract it
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.240]  they just removed it he said I hope this isn't a dirty trick and and now we see
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:55.400]  this happening right when he goes into Mexico that is kind of creepy it is a
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.120]  strange coincidence that you know the moment that he's out of the country and
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:04.720]  is unable to directly respond on the same day you know does does is it is a
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.240]  creepy coincidence you know I don't know I mean the guys out promoting a book you
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:15.000]  know I saw the interview with open Anthony you know apparently some caller
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.520]  called in to ask about it which you know okay that's that you know that's on
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.560]  their word I don't know maybe they somebody did maybe some of it who knows
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:27.400]  I come on you know it looks stage you agree with my analysis oh I mean I would
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:33.680]  say that it definitely you know it smells of PR it smells of publicity you
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:38.960]  know it smells of you know publicity you know but I also makes fun of your dad
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.680]  and calls him a geriatric I mean your dad's in pretty darn good shape yeah
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.600]  yeah it's you know it's you know I can't speak for him I don't know what's in
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.120]  his head but I do know that you know obviously he probably disagrees with my
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.120]  father's opinion on the war and opinions on Bush Cheney and and you know that
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.520]  probably upset but I you know it sounds like it does well let me fill you in on
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:06.000]  the guy of course the most famous turkey shoot is Fallujah and he brags about
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  shooting a woman and he calls them savages and it's pretty incendiary he's
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  from right here in Texas he's a good old boy but rodeo bronc you know get rider
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.400]  you know chip off the old block as they'd say seems like a nice guy at many
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  levels but doesn't seem like he's super intellectual or that's smart compared to
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.400]  some of the seals I know and he's sitting there he has a mercenary firm out
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.000]  of North Texas that prepares local police to fight insurgents in America
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.280]  so the whole rollout we see happening and he advises the US military and is
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:49.720]  involved with some Israeli groups that advise US military and he's he's been
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:53.240]  given awards by a group and works for the group created by Richard Pearl and
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:26:00.480]  Dick Cheney so this guy's pretty you know what's that sounds like he's a pretty
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.040]  connected guy you know like I said I don't know much about him I've been kind
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.920]  of on jury duty so I've been able to really follow up extensively with with
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.320]  three years and things like that you know trying to get the rest I can be a
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:18.480]  good juror if this turns out to not be true and or parts of it large parts of
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:25.200]  it aren't I mean your dad is not gonna just probably down and take it I can't
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.000]  imagine that but I can't imagine he would he wouldn't lay down and take it
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.960]  but I don't know him you know but I you know I if this is untrue which it
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:40.360]  really smells like it is you know I'm sure my dad will speak you know I
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:43.480]  don't know I mean it's up to him well he's the only person ever beat Vince
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:48.360]  McMahon in a lawsuit he didn't beat the TSA but but he sure tried they just
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:52.640]  wouldn't give him a trial so yeah I know your dad's not litigious but he's not
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:58.080]  gonna lay down and take this if it's I can't imagine that you know I yeah I
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.840]  like I said I don't want to speak for him I haven't I haven't been able to talk
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.240]  directly for him and I'm not him if it was me and then I was in a situation
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:10.280]  where someone were to you know make up something completely false and then say
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.520]  that I believed in the killing of US soldiers if it was me I would if I was
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.800]  able to bring a defamation lawsuit or something like that of course I will you
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.040]  know but that's me if I'm not my dad so you know we'll just well this guy's
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:28.440]  certainly making himself you know a big name and I guess he'll get some big
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:32.000]  government contracts out of it and maybe some big guys told him to go with it or
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.840]  maybe part of it's true or he or seven years later his six years later his
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.200]  memories not clear but I mean I just know your dad pretty darn good you know
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.680]  I'm a lot better than I do obviously and I've seen him talking to troops getting
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:46.240]  tears in his eyes and talking how much he how much he hates troops dying and
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:50.680]  the Navy SEALs and the Navy and how that's the very that's the very reason
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:54.760]  that he he dislikes the war is that he doesn't want to see soldiers or innocent
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:01.120]  civilians getting killed for a war based on lies and and and and you know he
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.000]  doesn't that's why he's against it in the first place he doesn't want to see
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.520]  people getting killed for for no good reason so that's what I mean it makes
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:14.560]  no logical sense to me but he would wish death upon servicemen when his whole
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.560]  stance against the war is that he doesn't want to be servicemen or civilians
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.440]  getting killed so basically we can conceive exactly that your dad may have
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.160]  been sucker punched and this guy ran off which he says he did which is really
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.000]  weird I doubt I really doubt he was even sucker punched I don't know like I said I
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.080]  think I would have heard about exactly but that could be in the realm of
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:40.000]  possibility like a Loch Ness monster but but but that he would say I you know
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.560]  troops need to die I like it when US troops die that's in the realm of
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:48.520]  Easter bunnies yeah yeah I mean I I never I could never see my dad saying
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:53.520]  that or even remotely if you see I I can't even see him saying it
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.880]  sarcastically but once again I won't I don't I don't know until I talk to him
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.400]  directly well and I know you didn't even want to come on and speak for him it
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.720]  didn't you change your mind I said well I guess if I can't get a hold of him
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.480]  somebody's got to respond I hope the media doing this hit job will at least
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.400]  look at what you've said and obviously he called here a few weeks ago on the
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:13.960]  last fake piece of news it was proven fake so the the line is tie you call me
[01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.560]  anytime I can assure you out for the moment that I get work from him on what
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:23.920]  to do and if that if that involves you know talking to you again there's
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.560]  something of that nature whatever we decide you I will let you know I'll
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:31.520]  drive into the studio anytime at midnight you know six in the morning
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.680]  whenever he wants to tape an interview or do it live we're here Tyra

[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.840]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.640]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:13.720]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.960]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.240]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:26.220]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.360]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.320]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.480]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:42.280]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:46.200]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my old sponsors you
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:51.720]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:04.400]  1-877-327-0365 hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:08.840]  silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:13.320]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing a solution
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:17.160]  through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:21.520]  airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.640]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:31.000]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.200]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:39.840]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:44.000]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.320]  production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.160]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:57.960]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:23.600]  I'm done talking about the Ventura mystery until we hear from Jesse but
[01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.760]  we've covered it in detail today probably spent 30 minutes total last hour
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.600]  and a half on or more because it just gets into psyops and it gets into type
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.960]  of things they'll do I mean take Jesse Ventura they knew he was major
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:44.640]  political material back when he was more mainstream before he fully woke up in
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:53.520]  2000 so they come to him in 2001 2002 they come to him in 2002 they give
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:59.200]  him a big contract close to ten million dollars nine million plus for a three
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:05.280]  year contract to host primetime show on MSNBC back when they actually had
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:12.000]  viewers and then the war starts and he says no I'm not gonna be pro-war and
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.600]  they say okay you can keep the money but you're barred from even giving it back
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.560]  we'll sue you if you even try to give it back and he said no I keep contracts
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:31.080]  they say no media interviews of any type look at your contract and so for three
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:39.160]  years until 2006 he's gone they paid him close to ten million dollars and later
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:43.880]  he was told by folks oh they you are approached MSNBC gets government money
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.480]  which we now know from banker bailouts and things that have come out but back
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.720]  then this was wild to hear and the government actually wanted that you
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.280]  tied down and the end of the end you would have had the job been this big TV
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:59.320]  guy if you would have played ball but if not they were just going to shut you
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:04.200]  down and they had your profile and so that was the plan all along so they
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:09.200]  paid him nine plus million dollars he's now talked about this since actually
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:13.840]  broken a few years ago here on my show and that all of this went on so now
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:17.840]  they're getting ready to launch an Iran war they know Jesse Ventura is floating
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:22.440]  around thinking about coming back if there was an attack on Iran he was
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:24.840]  thinking about getting involved in the political process at least given
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:29.360]  speeches or whatever that at least was being looked at I can tell you he was
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.680]  thinking about running for president there was some other talk I'm not going
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.640]  to get into but the point is is that he's got major name recognition and
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:43.480]  that's what's valuable in politics so he is this commodity and so this smells
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.760]  completely of Syop the way it was deployed the way it was put out the way
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:52.080]  it was done the way it was said just just the whole thing I mean it's like when
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.440]  you walk into a clothing shop I'm not even you know a clothes horse and know
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.360]  that much about it but I've learned enough to know the cut of a fine suit or
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.360]  an Armani don't have an Armani suit but I've learned what they look like for
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.600]  movies and TV and I've been in stores I've seen I'm like are those Armani's
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.160]  yeah those are Armani's about two years ago I was at Nordstrom's buying some
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.040]  shoes says are those Armani suits that yeah how'd you know I'll see that cut
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.880]  with this it's a lot more obvious like a yellow Volkswagen drives by or a red
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.440]  fire truck that's a red fire truck I mean you know a PR rollout when you see
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:29.720]  one in the you know a book comes out all this is done and it just shows you that
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.320]  as soon as I investigated the guy and he may be dumb and being handled being
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:37.120]  manipulated and part of it's true and they got into spin it but you know part
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.240]  of si-hopping and moving to the next level out of the military is doing bad
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:46.120]  things and I don't know that's the case yet the guy conceivably could be telling
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:53.440]  the truth Tyrell says he doesn't think so and I tend to agree with it it just
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.880]  shows you what they're capable of so if they ever do stuff like this to me you
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.920]  know I'm walking down the street and they jump out with a you know quadriplegic
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.480]  kid in a wheelchair and say I assault him like they did our reporters up in
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:13.760]  New York and turned out it was staged with again news core and the New York
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.360]  post and it came out in court it was staged the Secret Service wouldn't lie
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.960]  I mean they could do any of this to us folks so we just need to remember you
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:25.640]  asked Ron Paul that was the point I wanted to make before we go to Charlotte
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:31.320]  think of what they're trying with Ron Paul and one of my reporters just ran in
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.200]  I've got to learn more later but reportedly they're putting ads out now
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.240]  claiming their Ron Paul ads but they aren't his Ron Paul ads saying bad
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:44.880]  things about Asians and blacks and people so I've got to learn about this
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:48.400]  dirty trick I mean it's gonna get crazy by the way we told you about this two
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:54.800]  days ago it's now in the news in fact I had it here in my stack they're
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:03.200]  admitting on NPR and they're admitting on oh and on other mainline newspapers that
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.960]  Romney was given votes that were not his and it's the same thing with Huntsman
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:15.160]  I've got a whole stack on that I mean there's a certain point where you can't
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:19.120]  even keep track of this anymore they're supposed to call in and all these
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.120]  precincts and now it turns out in a whole bunch of them it's been confirmed
[01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.040]  we don't know how many though but it's been confirmed a bunch of them we know
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.360]  the precincts that they told them just put it in a truck and drive it to this
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:33.280]  other location to have them counted and then and then we'll call that in and
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.040]  then trucks didn't make it and then they had gentlemen's agreements we played
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:42.520]  that clip from Fox News with Carl Rove deciding to give what six more points to
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:49.280]  Huntsman clearly making and beat Ron Paul I mean it's just confirmed but it's
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:59.840]  too sophisticated for the general public yeah that was Santorum at a certain
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.840]  point I can't even keep track of it anymore this is what these people do
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:06.640]  they just swarm you with this info and they know the public's halfway pan
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:10.000]  attention people on the street go I've seen you on TV with Hulk Hogan on that
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.920]  conspiracy show and I go it's Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory that's Jesse
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:21.120]  Ventura that was back when one of my neighbors was a was a bank manager pretty
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.360]  smart guy and I'm like no and he was arguing me goes no you got a show with
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.760]  Hulk Hogan I'm good no man I don't have a show with Hulk Hogan that's the same
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.480]  thing I know I'm gonna hear people down the road well that that's that Hulk Hogan
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:46.160]  guy got punched out by a Navy SEAL it just never ends how they count on people not paying attention
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:52.160]  and how they manipulate you now I'm very excited to have Charlotte Isherby on
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:57.480]  with us till about 40 after next hour so we'll have her for more than an hour here
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:03.640]  with us today we put out a documentary that's free to the public and we've got
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:08.640]  it linked up today at info wars calm Charlotte Isherby blows skull and bones
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.320]  wide open and she originally did it decades ago but didn't want the credit
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:16.800]  giving a investigative reporter will formally top congressional researcher
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.560]  Anthony Sutton the material to put out his books on the skull and bones which
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:29.720]  were the definitive tomes but I've got her on today to Nexus I probably should
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:33.600]  have told her this ahead ahead of time but to just to recap before she gets
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:39.440]  born education the history of skull and bones setting up modern education in
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:43.600]  Europe in Germany here in the US and those connections and of course she
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.680]  knows about skull and bones because her father and grandfather were and she has
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:50.360]  a lot of the internal documents and has one of their official grandfather clocks
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:55.160]  and a lot of information she showed us that was put out for the first time a
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:59.080]  lot of it was not put out for the first time but was integrated together for the
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.200]  first time as well so as a public service we of course to understand the
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.280]  secret establishment understand what we're up against put that out to the
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:11.920]  public prison planet TV viewers of course saw it first her original Dallas
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.520]  phone book size book is no longer in print but it's free on her website
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:20.000]  graciously because she wants to stop these tyrants but I convinced her I
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.600]  don't know six or seven months ago I said and others did I said why don't you
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.880]  come out I know you said you weren't going to print it again you don't want
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:30.000]  to mess with it you're retired and want to travel the world and things you've
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.800]  done your service but why don't you just reprint it again people want it she
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:36.720]  said no it's free on the website and then I said well you've got all these new
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.360]  articles you've written why don't you put those together in a book she said
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.840]  you know what I'll do I'll just kind of update revise and a bridge my big phone
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:47.840]  book size one and put out the deliberate dumbing down of America revised the
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:54.440]  bridged edition Charlotte Thompson Thompson is a big and so this is now
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.600]  available at info wars dot com we've got a treasure trove of them and I hope
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:03.040]  that you order them because once these run out we don't know if she'll ever
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.520]  even reprint them because again the question is does she want to deal with
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:09.200]  that she may just put it out for free again but if you want a hard copy of
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.280]  this new version of Liberty coming down full of all the documents and all the
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:16.760]  incredible proof of the plan to dumb down our children and turn us into
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:20.520]  basically servile animals that are incapable of thought as Bertrand Russell
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.000]  said they'll dumb us down with diet injections and injunctions and
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  education to the point of it'll be like sheep revolting against the process of
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.600]  and the fashion of eating it would be like sheep revolting against the
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.560]  practice of eating mutton you know I sound a bit out of it today sometimes
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:47.640]  can't recall things quite as well I cracked some ribs and separated some
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:54.000]  ribs dropping a weight on myself in a weightlifting accident last weekend
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.160]  some a little bit out of it not on painkillers the painkillers make me
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.480]  nauseous I am on about ten Advil today so far but I'm just a little bit out of
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:07.320]  it so so so bear with me today okay so joining us is Charlotte is there be to
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:12.880]  break down this information Charlotte it is wonderful to have you here I want to
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:17.040]  go to the beginning briefly skull and bones the tie-in and then what the plan
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.040]  was what you discovered in the 80s as the head of policy number two position
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:23.800]  Department of Education your whistle-blowing and now what's currently
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:28.200]  happening with education your warning for the public but we salute you for
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.280]  your work and thank you for reissuing a new book thank you so much thank you
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:37.400]  Alex and thank you all your audience for your support you know through the years
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.240]  I think the best place for people to go is and you have that PDF I believe up on
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:49.040]  your website now yes to that it's a PDF and it's called America's Road to Ruin
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:54.800]  and there were two marvelous gals researchers that I respect highly very
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:00.360]  involved in the extraordinary search all of us have done on this who heard that
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:06.200]  first video that was filmed on the river here saw it Alex the video that it was
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:11.320]  guys did a good job on and it was in regard to education but it really dealt
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.960]  with everything right I didn't deal so much with the order and I will deal with
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:22.120]  that in within about two minutes but it dealt with my whole life since I was
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:28.280]  went abroad in when I was 21 years old and it's beautifully done it's a
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.880]  transcript the gals transcribed that video Alex and then one of our most
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:39.880]  talented people Deborah Neewa who's in publishing and graphics and all put it
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.160]  all together even as a picture of my little dog on it and my husband and me
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:51.280]  as a PDF so your listeners can click on that and they can read that it's 16
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.600]  pages that's the video that your great guys did when they were up here the
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.280]  first one then the second one was on the order and I don't know what that has
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:05.520]  not been transcribed but I hope people will go and look at it because it has
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:10.680]  had a maximum number of hits it was these have been very good videos by the
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:16.000]  way I just think your guys are great you have a tremendously capable staff there
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.920]  wouldn't be creating these videos but you know I found out something about the
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:26.000]  order it's great I found out more about the order since you got onto it and
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.440]  actually since Anthony Southern got on to it than I ever knew before because
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:37.240]  obviously as George Bush would say it's a secret so I can't talk about it I
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.200]  mean I don't know anything about it basically because it was a secret and
[01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.600]  my father and grandfather couldn't talk about it but I did know all their
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.400]  friends and that did that that really helped out a great deal there's a
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:56.880]  tremendous amount a very interesting chapter in Chris Milligan's book on the
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:02.680]  order with the culture fleshing out skull and bones that book has not been
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.480]  reprinted but it's a wonderful book fleshing out skull and bones that Chris
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.560]  Milligan knew Anthony Southern too I did a chapter in there that's quite
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:14.960]  interesting if anybody wants to go I think it's you may be able to find that
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:21.080]  on the internet about my family's connections as well now when I after the
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.160]  last interview that we did on this I thought you know I was looking through
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:31.520]  some of my old files and I found a very interesting article from one of the
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:36.280]  little patriotic newsletters that we managed to get around the country in
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:43.520]  regard to Harold Howe and how he was responsible under Lyndon Johnson for all
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:49.200]  the major changes in education using of course the minorities to bring about the
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.280]  destruction of our education system that we're looking at today with
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.120]  consolidation getting rid of little schools and all this remember way back
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.160]  in the 60s they said it was because they wanted the minorities have a better
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.920]  education that wasn't it at all Harold Howe came out and said with this
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:13.040]  integration he was going to totally turn the education system on its head and so
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:16.160]  they put in my thing and they did all this bad and here my little head is
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:20.400]  going I'm taking Harold Howe you know what I'm gonna go take a look at one of
[01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.080]  those well Charlotte I listen I want you to get into that but but but for you to
[01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:28.280]  say I know nothing about it and giggle you gave Anthony Sutton the documents
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.560]  the materials the roll list the information when nothing was known your
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:40.880]  your father you know his father were sculling bones and I mean you do know a
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:47.240]  lot your son knows a ton a lot of grout listen Alex what I want people to know
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.720]  is this is so important and you interrupted me okay Harold Howe I
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.520]  looked him up here you want to hear what he was at sculling bones he's sculling
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:04.560]  bones now this I'm going to say this convinces me that the order at Yale and I
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.840]  didn't really have to be too much convinced but when I found this out I'm
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.720]  convinced that the order at Yale of sculling bones is responsible for the
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:19.360]  complete transformation of American education to workforce training to
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.400]  considering our children is nothing but animals which was the philosophy of
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:31.600]  Wilhelm Wundt in life's sake who trained all the American educators starting
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:40.320]  with hell going over in the mid-1800s trained them in how to not educate but
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:46.800]  to train our children as animals using Pavlovian method skinner I know I know
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:53.040]  that's true I'm absolutely convinced and when I read that Harold on your read
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.440]  Harold Howe 1940 sculling bones this is on page 128 of one of those little black
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:07.680]  books it says here education Lauren August 17 1918 Hartford Connecticut vice

[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:47.320]  that's when the damage was done if you recall folks the damage was most people
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:54.000]  aren't experts on education like you are that's when the rest of the total upheaval
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:58.160]  putting outcomes performance-based education elementary and secondary
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.880]  education that's when dog training came in and so that's why this is so key when
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:06.120]  the dog training came in they changed from teaching the teachers teaching
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:11.280]  students of history math science and all what they know in their head to what
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:15.920]  they could do performance and then they retrained all the teachers as little
[01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:24.240]  psychiatrists after 1965 which was what brought to some the Canadian psychiatrist
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.600]  good friend of Altarist called for getting rid of the conscience and if
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:33.440]  you're gonna get rid of the conscience chapter psychiatry and the reason I want

[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.640]  order because they've been Pavlovian conditioned that it's cute and funny and
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:45.240]  the info babe laughs on Fox News when they talk about it so their winners
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:49.680]  psychologically when they're losers and then there's the chemicals in the water
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:54.080]  everything else but German scientists it's on record develop what became
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:00.160]  psychiatry it's not Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud and all that so of course the
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.800]  Germans develop the Hessian soldiers who love being slaves love being military
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.200]  slaves they had slavery in Germany white slaves and they were happy to be white
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.880]  slaves and they said well the British royalty was German royalty was really
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:17.680]  Transylvanian royalty they'd always said you've got the best soldier slaves how
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.320]  do you do it they don't even run off very often though some of them did actually
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:24.360]  run off here because there was big German communities they broke their
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.000]  conditioning you know they had the blue uniforms the big black boots that's where
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  that all comes from Hessian boots and that they were the main force that was
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.120]  backing up the Redcoats and of course Washington beat a bunch of them at
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.560]  Trenton New Jersey famously but but Charles the point is in the video that
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:44.320]  we just reposted along with the PDF report you talked about and info wars
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:48.080]  dot com you break it all down eloquently with the documents but the British
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:52.440]  royalty funded people to go over and figure this out and then you've got the
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:56.080]  German and the British connection funding skull and bones being set up as
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:01.360]  this think tank please continue because this is so key what you discovered and
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:07.720]  all these connections well it's terribly important because when I started out I
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:12.800]  didn't understand behavior model opera conditioning it's so simple folks it's
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.960]  simply when you go to the doctor the doctor hits your knee you know used to
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:21.880]  anyway with a little hammer and your knee pops up it's a neurological reaction
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:28.720]  and Wilhelm would be the psychologist in the mid-1800s in lipstick he finally
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:33.840]  realized that he could not do anything with getting people to change their
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.240]  behavior just using regular philosophy and psychology because the soul he
[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:43.480]  couldn't deal with the soul it floats around right so we decided just to use
[01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:48.240]  the neurology and if you can understand that you understand why Americans just
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.480]  have these reflexes and you tell them something and they if you if you reward
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:57.080]  them immediately they'll do anything you want for the rest of time but the
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:01.840]  important thing about this relationship with skull and bones is that Wilhelm
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:09.760]  wanted his it was born in 1832 in Germany his father was a minister his
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:16.160]  grandfather Kirchner Carl customer want with professor Heidelberg University
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:23.120]  and this the Illuminati order documents that we've been we've been able to get
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.520]  a hold of that Raphael in the Illuminati is identified as the same professor
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:36.200]  Carl customer want and is referred to in the Illuminati provincial report from
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:44.480]  Utica 1782 now that is the grandfather of Wilhelm want so this method that is
[01:57:44.480 --> 01:57:48.920]  being introduced in the United States mainly of course of the computer because
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:53.280]  there's BF Skinner said the computer is my box and Skinner followed in the steps
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:59.120]  of Pavlov who interestingly enough was trained by want not the other way around
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:04.760]  so what's going in now is this method I'm talking to you about this minute
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:09.040]  operant conditioning now you know with your dog you know you want your dog to
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:14.600]  sit you give him a seat because a dog that he'll sit for you the next time when
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:18.880]  I first saw this in the US Department of Ed I wondered all these books that I
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.120]  would see in the bookshelves the department said what works and I didn't
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:26.920]  pay much attention one day I pulled it out a book out and I saw this is under
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:31.200]  Carol Bell under this is some of the big secrets here stay there Charlotte

[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:09.120]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:13.920]  are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:18.280]  citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:23.560]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.320]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the

[02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:20.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:29.680]  Alex Jones. By the way we've got the West Point grad who was arrested for
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:35.360]  photographing police here in Austin. It's a big story now, now a national story
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:41.320]  because it looks like they set him up. He's gonna be in studio with us. He's
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:43.480]  pretty stressed out from all the attention he's given. He's gonna be on the
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:48.800]  nightly news tonight. We've got some other guests as well. Paul Watson will do the
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:53.120]  news portion. I'm gonna do the interviews, the two interviews this evening. The
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:58.080]  comedian and social commentary guy Lionel will also be on with us via Skype.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:02.040]  But let's go back to Charlotte. This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:05.920]  So Charlotte you start discovering all of this and then now years later are
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.520]  able to tie it into skull and bones but you were saying you pulled off the shelf
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:13.080]  at the Department of Education. This book, it was talking about what works.
[02:01:13.080 --> 02:01:18.160]  It works. Well what works is animal psychology and that's just what I told you.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:21.400]  With your dog, you can train your dog. It's very, very simple. All of you must
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.240]  understand that that is simply, that is the computer technology. Your child is
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:29.920]  the computer which, no more books. Books are down the tubes. All the history of
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.520]  this is in my book which is the abbreviated version but it's a fantastic
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:41.000]  version. Nothing chronological has been taken out and this is the history of
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:49.640]  of what happened but it's getting into the computer. When the top people like
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.760]  at Wycat, World Institute for Computer Assisted Teaching, Dustin Houston said this
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.680]  folks and parents listen. He knew what was coming. This is 20 years ago. He said,
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:05.000]  won't it be wonderful when a student in the most remote part of the country can
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.080]  have the equivalent of five of the world's greatest psychologists on the
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:15.880]  computer and nobody will be able to get between that the student and the
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:22.400]  software, the computer. So it's very, very dangerous and even the tops of
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:27.600]  educators who are involved in computer technology. Once I got fired for
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.440]  leaking a document, one of these educators that was one of his
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:37.520]  major grants, Better Education Skills through Technology, this fellow, Donald
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:44.080]  Ely, he admitted in his internal papers that if you don't agree as a computer
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:50.160]  tech guy or professor, if you don't agree with the message, you do not put it on
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.080]  that software. You have to have a conscience because it is so powerful.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:00.960]  Now folks, this is what's going in now. No more books. Now, what we're gonna say is...
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.640]  Well, I mean, it allows total centralization. This is what Schollin-Bowes brought back into the
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:11.040]  United States from Wilhelm Mundt, who is directly connected with the Illuminati.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.280]  This is what they brought back to this G. Stanley Hall. In the United States, they
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:21.280]  stacked all of the universities, Columbia, Chicago, etc., with people like Dewey,
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:27.680]  Thorndike, et al. who believe man is nothing but an animal to be trained. Now,
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:33.320]  C.S. Lewis was the one who said, when you stop educating and you start, and you
[02:03:33.320 --> 02:03:37.000]  start training, which is what they're doing right now for the planned economy,
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:47.240]  global, when you stop educating and you start training, civilization dies. Now,
[02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:52.000]  that's C.S. Lewis. All right? Now, my little book, the abbreviated version, is
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.920]  fantastic. All the sections that have been taken out, the big chunks, the
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:02.480]  appendices, the index, etc., are available free at my website. It's a free
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:07.680]  download, the old book, The Big Baby. So anybody who wants to check on what may
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:11.280]  have been removed, there's three little dark keys. Whenever something's removed,
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:16.760]  they just go on the Internet. But it's a very user-friendly, beautiful book. I find
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:21.160]  myself, my son said to me, Mom, I've never seen you reading your book as much as
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:27.080]  you're reading it now. Well, I am because it's so nice and small and handy. And I
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:32.440]  just delight in my own book. It was always very, very big. And we had people who
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:36.360]  loved it, obviously, or it wouldn't be out of print and selling for $1,000 in
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.800]  some places. You know, ridiculous. $200, $400, $600 at Amazon. It's the old book,
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:47.200]  right? The people who've got old copies or whatever. But it was always
[02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:53.200]  large and rather cumbersome. So now this is a beautiful version that you can give
[02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:56.440]  to your friends. It is. Charlotte, stay there. Let's come back. We gotta go to
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.920]  break. Let's tie in the Illuminati to scullin' bones to education.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:04.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:07.960]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:11.520]  know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:15.200]  silver or gold? It's true. Seeds have all performed even gold and silver before
[02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:19.040]  in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends
[02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:22.600]  at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:28.120]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:31.920]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family. And here's the best part. These
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:35.520]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.600]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at
[02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:44.720]  survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:55.480]  877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:59.840]  seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:13.240]  reality. It really says that the state is God. The United States is now
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:17.880]  recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth. This
[02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.360]  film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:26.880]  being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.880]  government program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:35.000]  four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.040]  to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scammers, sound
[02:07:40.040 --> 02:07:45.280]  cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:49.360]  the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:56.120]  coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the

[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:16.840]  cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:28.640]  network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Yesterday I interviewed an
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:35.800]  investigative journalist breaking down government documents where over 40 known
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:42.400]  cancer viruses were added to the polio vaccines. It's still done. I have other
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:47.520]  top scientists and doctors like Russell Blalock on and the only conclusion they
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:53.440]  can come to is that it's being done by design. The Aspartame, the MSG, the
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:09:00.920]  additives. And then lo and behold, we have all these UN and Club of Rome documents
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:06.120]  in Rockefeller Foundation where they're adding the chemicals into the food, the
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  water, the additives, the printer ink, and so Charlotte is going to be hitting it
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:15.960]  from another angle, breaking down skull and bones and where the elite got this
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.640]  philosophy to dumb people down. Now, they put this fog of chemicals and things
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.520]  out there, but then to make us animals and to tell us we're animals that don't
[02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:30.440]  have free will, well, they play the part of God. These Illuminati believe they are
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:37.520]  man. We are the profane animal. But to make us the animal, they bombard us
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:44.920]  with this and then try to train us, not educate us. And that's programming versus
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.920]  learning the mysteries of the world, learning to enjoy knowledge and systems.
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:54.240]  They want people to be very, very one-dimensional. Now, Charlotte Israby is
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:58.880]  not only one of the most famous whistleblowers. I'm building her up, you
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.840]  know, she'll talk herself down. But I mean, she was the head of policy
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:05.080]  department of education that blew the whistle, brought the documents out, got
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:09.440]  basically fired over it, and her book documents that, the Liberal Dumbing Down
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:12.960]  of America. But then she's also the lady that helped give Anthony Sutton the
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.760]  material that exposed skull and bones. But in decades later, continuing to research,
[02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.600]  that was hiding under her nose as well, that it was skull and bones that actually
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.200]  set the modern policy for all of this. Now, you were getting into the
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:30.680]  Illuminati connections. Charlotte, go ahead.
[02:10:30.680 --> 02:10:35.240]  Well, this is fascinating. I mean, things that happen in my life are unbelievable.
[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:39.240]  You're right. For about 30 years, I did all the research on BF Skinner and
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:43.800]  Pavlov and how these methods, like the reading method, direct instruction that
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:48.200]  the conservatives managed to get across the country now because it's necessary
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:51.400]  for workforce training. Of course, they got into reading first,
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.280]  experimenting on the minorities with it, et cetera. But I was studying this stuff
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:11:01.080]  and I knew it makes children sick. I have a friend, a great teacher in Arizona,
[02:11:01.080 --> 02:11:06.200]  Ann Hurser, who educated me. I have all the documents from doctors about how this
[02:11:06.200 --> 02:11:11.880]  upper conditioning, these programs, make children sick. And, you know, anyway, so
[02:11:11.880 --> 02:11:15.680]  here I'm looking at all this. I have all the major documents. It takes me quite a
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:22.160]  long time. I understand that, but I had no idea that the order at Yale that my
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:27.360]  father and grandfather belonged to, it was the order that actually brought this
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:31.640]  method back from Germany. And it's very interesting because the Germans are
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:36.080]  extremely involved in this. They were, and perhaps still are, I mean, in the
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:39.760]  four-eyed thing. And all Dennis Cutty's just written a wonderful new book, which
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:47.280]  my son is reading, and which deals with how all this stuff is the Germans. It's
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.720]  Nazi stuff, too. So it's not just the communists. It's the Nazis, the fascists,
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:57.280]  the socialists. I would say America is not an Islamic country, but we are really
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.640]  deep in the mess right now with the isms. But anyway, going back to the order, so
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.960]  little Charlotte, you know, the one that gets fired from the department for
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:11.720]  leaking these documents, I knew how bad the Department of Education was. It
[02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:17.720]  totally marks a factory, right? All of a sudden, you know, I find out, basically,
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:22.320]  I find out, most of this, I found out from Anthony Sutton, who had done the
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:27.160]  research. He's the one who found out about the connection with Wilhelm
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:31.120]  Wurndt with the Illuminati. Wilhelm Wurndt's grandfather was a member of the
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:36.360]  Illuminati. Well, I remember, I sent Tony Sutton, there were some documents in
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:40.960]  German that I never saw again, but I sent them to Sutton. I didn't know what they
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:45.080]  were, but Sutton got to it. I don't know whether I lost them when he returned them,
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:51.720]  but anyway, I am quite truly convinced that, let's look at this way folks, there
[02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:57.160]  is nothing more important than the loss of free will. We have a soul and a
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:03.880]  conscience. What was brought back from Germany offered conditioning, Pavlov
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:11.680]  studied under Wurndt. This is the method to destroy the human individual made in
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:17.880]  the image of God to destroy his conscience. You must remember this, I think you
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:22.720]  probably think I'm exaggerating. I'm not. This is what we're looking at. This is more
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.080]  important than anything being talked about in the news today. The loss of
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:34.080]  the conscience. I've written a lot on this, it's on the internet, you can find my articles.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:42.480]  This is what happened when the Order at Yale decided to get their guys,
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:48.280]  educators, educated in Germany and many of the under actually, it was the G. Stanley Hall,
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:54.080]  was the first one, and he admits to being half a Marxist himself back in the mid-1800s,
[02:13:54.080 --> 02:13:59.840]  mind you. He admitted to that. So he brings it back, it's picked up by Dewey and
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:05.160]  Thorndyke, etc. and the method goes into the teacher's colleges and our teachers
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:10.280]  are trained to train our students. Trained, trained, not educated. Of course this
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:16.480]  didn't happen until 1965. Now the results of this, one could see this morning, I
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:20.760]  opened up the computer and I was Fox News interested enough, which won't cover my
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.360]  book of course, but they did cover like, oh my goodness me, how can this be possible?
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:30.000]  This Jack Chambers, an economic professor in a college, I didn't get it all written
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.480]  down, he asked his students what the American dream means to them. This is a
[02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:41.680]  college. And he asked specifically, what do you think the government should do?
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:48.680]  Well, 10% good for them said, leave me alone. 80% said that the government should
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:53.880]  take care of their vacations, make sure they get a good job, give them health
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:15:01.400]  care, give them housing, and that the wealthy should be taxed. More. No. There was
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:07.040]  one individual who said, can you believe this one? As human beings, we are not
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:12.160]  responsible for our actions. We need the government to keep us in line.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:17.320]  That's not a direct quote, I just want to remember that. But first of all, this
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.160]  individual says we need the government to keep us in line and we're not
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:26.000]  responsible for our actions. That student evidently was very carefully trained
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:31.680]  into our win. They were animals, so they made a mistake. They still think they're
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:36.040]  human beings, but they're not. Well, you're right. Some people have been conditioned and
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:41.520]  trained like animals. All the way through from the time that G. Stanley Hall went
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:45.640]  over to Germany for the order and came back, we trained and now what we're
[02:15:45.640 --> 02:15:50.080]  looking at is the computer technology, it's nothing but Pavlovian. And that
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:54.680]  allows total centralization of the message but expanding on that and we
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:59.320]  see a global curriculum being standardized. I've seen the studies that
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:04.040]  there are now more sociopaths than there used to be and even more psychopaths
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:10.440]  and that the system is creating artificial sociopaths. Normally their
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:14.960]  numbers were were much lower and but they can also have it where they flip
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:20.920]  on a switch that makes you a sociopath but they can flip it back off when they
[02:16:20.920 --> 02:16:25.800]  want you to feel. So it's total programming. It's like they're biological
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:33.600]  androids and it's so scientifically done. How is their plan going along for them
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:36.440]  from your deep research of this from every angle?
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.680]  Well, I'm afraid they're highly successful. And the reason for this Alex is another
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:45.800]  thing that I've always bewildered us. Why is it that for instance when I wrote my book in 1985,
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:50.560]  the little 39 pager, back to basics reform that exposed all this kind of stuff,
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:54.640]  and said it was for a world government which would arrive you know in the 21st
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.000]  century, all of that. That book was boycotted across the board by the
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.920]  conservative movement. If that book had been listened to in 1985, we might not
[02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:08.240]  have this canary in opera conditioning on the on the computers, etc. right now,
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:12.040]  but they boycott it. Now wait a minute, isn't that isn't that interesting? The
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:17.800]  conservative. This is under Ronald Reagan, okay? And so anyway that happened and then I wrote my
[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:22.160]  big book because I figured maybe this will get well that was boycotted by
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.880]  them too. They've done nothing to get the big book and they do not want this
[02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:30.400]  information. Now I'm not, I'm sure the Democrats are involved in it as well. They
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:34.480]  pay for the funding and they love the Department of Education, blah blah blah.
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:41.240]  But I have to say that the school to work agenda which requires school choice,
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.280]  school choice is the most devastatingly bad thing that ever happened to this
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.480]  country because it's not really school choice whatsoever. It's federally funded
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:54.320]  charter schools that don't have elected officials running them because the
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:57.680]  corporations are going to run those charter schools to train for the
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.160]  workforce with this canary in opera conditioning on the computer. Now this is
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:06.080]  the conservative supporting this because the conservatives are notable for
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:09.600]  wanting to make money, right? I mean we know that it's nothing wrong with making
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:14.400]  money, but when you decide that you're going to turn your children over to be
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:19.760]  nothing but slaves in this in this planned economy or to be moved around the
[02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:23.160]  world and all these parts of my book from educators are going to be moved around
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:28.280]  the world wherever they need them. Using nothing but computer technology, opera
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:36.760]  conditioning, etc. to train them lifelong. There's also all these globalist groups
[02:18:36.760 --> 02:18:42.000]  now pushing the solution to the New World Order is mega computers that make
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.600]  all the decisions for us, but really those computers are programmed by the
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.360]  globalist themselves. It's a new form of tyranny.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:58.000]  Yes, it is and Alex, what we have to understand is that we've lost, I hate to say this,
[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:01.720]  maybe it's not completely true, but I believe we have lost the Christian
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:06.040]  community because the Christian community, the evangelicals, we always
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:10.120]  depended on them to support us in trying to get rid of these bad programs,
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.760]  especially you know Skinner and all. I never got any support for them from
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:19.160]  those bad community. In fact they even said that some of us were
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:23.520]  nutty. They said that we didn't know we're talking about with Skinner. We were
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:28.000]  wrong about these computerized, individualized education software and all.
[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.640]  They went up against us and I always wondered what is going on. Well now we
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:41.520]  know because they have been trained by Peter Drucker. Peter Drucker
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:46.800]  went all over the country. I tell you what, stay there. Let's expose. Sure, let's
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:50.560]  expose that and talk about Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They now are
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:54.840]  funding and running a lot of these quote charter schools. Part of it of course
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:20:00.120]  is tax money still and they're openly teaching you genics, kill granny for
[02:20:00.120 --> 02:20:06.240]  money, I mean everything. Folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip
[02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:10.200]  a switch to get the lights back on? If so this is going to be the most important
[02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:13.760]  message you'll ever hear because there's never been a better time to get ready
[02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:18.360]  for the winter power out of just ahead. Here's why. Solar power generators are
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:22.080]  now available from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:26.320]  sponsors. Their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power
[02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:30.160]  when you need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs
[02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:34.520]  quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the Sun. It's like
[02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:38.480]  having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own, whether it's
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.480]  ice storms, brownouts or blackouts. You'll never have to suffer through painful
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:46.680]  power outages again. When the power goes out this winter, you'll be ready with a
[02:20:46.680 --> 02:20:51.520]  solar-powered generator from Solutions from Science. Go to mysolarbackup.com
[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:59.560]  for more information. That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.920]  Hi, this is Peter Cronchonable from Midos Resources. As you know, federal
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:08.040]  government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct
[02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.920]  result of the spending policy. European government and central bank spending
[02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:15.560]  policies have put the European Union on the brink of collapse. What are you doing
[02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:19.240]  right now to protect yourself financially? Are your assets working for you or
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:23.000]  against you? One thing is certain. Having physical possession of gold and silver
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.480]  will guarantee that no matter what happens to our economy or the dollar, your
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:29.880]  investment will never be worthless. You know, protect you from that hidden tax,
[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:33.760]  inflation. If you've been thinking about investing in physical possession of
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:37.880]  precious metals or having an IRA in precious metals, I can help. Call me

[02:22:31.880 --> 02:22:35.480]  why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:39.800]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the
[02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:43.960]  value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:50.040]  word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.040 --> 02:22:55.720]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:10.080]  Don't worry, this show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:16.160]  Alright, we're gonna have a giant news blitz, I promise, at 40 after when
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.880]  Charlotte Thompson-Israbe leaves us. Whistleblower, author, researcher, patriot.
[02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:28.280]  And again, she's not against you having school choice but this is now just the
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:33.480]  corporations taking over the old local quote independent school district system,
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:39.400]  draining off their funding, putting only in a little bit of their money and getting
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:45.400]  control. Now you were breaking down how you discovered why you were blocked by
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:50.280]  quote conservatives but then also take the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:55.280]  They are involved in education at every level. They're involved just like Obama
[02:24:55.280 --> 02:24:59.800]  was breaking up local schools and turning them over to corporations. That's
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:05.120]  what they're now doing. And I could play clips of Bill Gates up there saying you
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:08.200]  don't give grandma health care, we can hire 10 teachers and the teachers
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:13.640]  clapping. So they're even selling this idea of cannibalism that you take
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.400]  something away from somebody, you get their resources, that's not how the
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:22.400]  world really works. It's a win-win-win, build-the-pie system is what we want, not
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:27.960]  a post-industrial shut-it-down system. So it's incredibly dangerous and
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.400]  classically authoritarian but you notice with the TSA checkpoints and the
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:37.560]  groping of our families, I mean they admit the TSA stuff is to break you, is to
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:41.760]  train you, is to pavlovianly get you used to them putting their hands on your
[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:45.000]  body. I mean this is all dog training as you said.
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:50.600]  Well yes Alex, in talking about the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is totally
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:55.560]  involved in putting us under this this international socialist system and whatever
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:58.880]  you want to call it, fascist, communist, totalitarian system, he's very involved.
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:06.160]  I mean the Microsoft has got agreements with communist China and Russia and
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:11.440]  everywhere and Gates has signed all sorts of agreements themselves and so they're
[02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:14.600]  really bad. Now talking about the foundations, let's get there. The
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  Tax Exempt Foundation, you can go to my son's website AmericanDeception.com and
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:25.440]  you've got the transcript of the congressional investigation of the
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:30.520]  Tax Exempt Foundation there. There was only one copy left in the country three
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:34.440]  years ago because the foundations brought up all the copies. They didn't want the
[02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:39.960]  American people to know what had happened in 1953 when all these traders had to
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:43.920]  answer questions during the investigation. They brought up all the copies, they got
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:49.160]  them all out of circulation except this one. First I bought it from, I understand
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:53.880]  that he was offered any amount of money for that one copy and he turned it down.
[02:26:53.880 --> 02:26:59.080]  I got the copy, my son put it up on the website, three thousand pages of
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:04.440]  documentation. Those are the, that was the investigation where Norman Dodd of the
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.400]  Rease Committee, Rease Committee went up to New York and off the record, that's why
[02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:14.080]  it's not on the Internet, it's not in the transcript, but off the record the
[02:27:14.080 --> 02:27:18.960]  President of the Ford Foundation, Rowan Gates, said to him, Mr Dodd, we get our
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:22.840]  instructions from the White House, how do you use our money? Eisenhower at the peak
[02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:28.280]  of the cold door, or that was, and the instructions were to change America, the
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:32.080]  foundations should change America to such an extent it could be comfortably
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:37.360]  merged with the Soviet Union. Now look, of course you say it's dead, no it's not.
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:42.280]  Communism, fascism, socialism, internationalism are all exactly what
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:46.080]  Gates are, what's going on. Exactly, the fool send emails saying you're calling it
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:49.440]  fascists or socialists, they're two different things, no, there's different
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:53.920]  dressing, little different tweaks, but it's all black uniforms, all government
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.080]  run, all surveillance, all state planned with the corporations over it, it's all
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:03.640]  the same thing. That's exactly what we're looking at, so what you Dodd was told is
[02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:08.240]  absolutely correct, Gates are told him they would be this merger, and if you go back to
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:12.120]  Lenin, Lenin said, look, first of all, all countries individually become
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:16.240]  socialists. That's what Carol quickly wrote, he said there's not a difference
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:20.360]  between fascism and communism, we work with all of it, we are creating a fusion
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:28.280]  of it. But they merge, once they're socialists then they merge in regions, so we've got all the regions being set up, Gorbachev called the European Union, the New
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:33.960]  European Soviet. Now the regional, regionalism is communism, and that quote is in
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:40.160]  my book, a very interesting quote, look it up, of Morris Zeiklin, he sees a communist
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:46.160]  daily world in the 70s, he said the United States has got to go have more regional
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.360]  government, because it works so well in the Soviet Union. It's going in now, folks,
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.800]  all over the place with sustainable development, dropping borders, getting
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.400]  rid of elected officials, don't forget charter schools don't have elected
[02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:04.740]  officials, so you're paying taxes to run these charter schools, which use a federal
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:10.680]  test, federal test, and all it really is is a globalist school, yes, and those
[02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:13.780]  those schools, 60% of the federal test is
[02:29:13.780 --> 02:29:18.000]  attitudinal, how they feel about the environment, what they think about the
[02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.480]  U.N. or whatever, do they believe in God, 60% of that test that the
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:27.920]  charter school students must take, because it's a federally funded entity, it's
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:32.200]  political, now remember this, do you want to talk about this? Yes, so they remove true
[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:37.440]  education about issues and about ideas and about and about science, it just all
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:42.080]  turns into pablum, so the kids are good little robots, and they burn that time up
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:45.120]  not really teaching them, we'll be right back with solutions, stay there Charlotte,
[02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:50.480]  final segment straight ahead with our guests, then newslets coming up. We're

[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:05.360]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator, number
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:09.120]  one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill,
[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:13.640]  number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:17.880]  company allows you to have, it's true, total government control of electricity
[02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:22.400]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming, number three, in some areas of
[02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:25.920]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:29.680]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem, number four,
[02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:33.800]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids, every year thousands of
[02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:37.560]  families lose their power from weather related onages, number five, a solar
[02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:41.600]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind, folks I
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.320]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:47.760]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information at

[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:05.040]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones, I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to
[02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:10.080]  spot savings, opportunity and recognize risk, saving means to make money, the

[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:28.320]  no useless dyes, perfumes deodorants or antibacterials, your risk is the hundreds
[02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:32.680]  of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores and
[02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:36.600]  deteriorating clothing called lint, if you want something better, if you want
[02:32:36.600 --> 02:32:39.600]  something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done

[02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:34.160]  Alright, it's our final segment with Charlotte Isherby and again we're selling
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:39.240]  the book, she has the old big thick version up for free on her website and
[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:42.240]  just didn't want to deal with the hard copy anymore and people convinced her
[02:33:42.240 --> 02:33:46.040]  hey this is important to have a hard copy of, they can shut stuff off the web
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:51.160]  really easy so she's put out a new updated, abridged, revised, shorter one,
[02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:55.720]  it's only 450-something pages long, it's excellent and every teacher, every
[02:33:55.720 --> 02:34:00.920]  educator, you know needs a copy of this because then everything will make sense
[02:34:00.920 --> 02:34:05.040]  to them and it has all the documents, I mean she was the head of policy, that's
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:09.520]  the number two position at the Department of Education, she's published the
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:14.320]  documents where they admit they want a global Soviet system, run by the mega
[02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:19.040]  elite, they want to shut down all their competition and you notice everything we
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:22.600]  warn you about keeps happening because we've got all their documents, that's
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:25.960]  what's so frustrating about this, Charlotte you're getting into a key
[02:34:25.960 --> 02:34:30.520]  point there as we went to break, please continue. Well I don't know where I was
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:35.440]  on that one Alex but all I can say is because we don't have much time left, I
[02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:42.440]  want, first of all I do, the reason for the book is that I felt it had to come
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:47.640]  out at this time, I think that book is really very very important, there are many
[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:51.880]  books out there but this gives you not just education history but the history
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:55.760]  of the insiders for the beginning of the last century or even going back into the
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:00.400]  1800s, it's the Federal Reserve, it's everything else too that's in there, what
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:06.000]  happened, disarmament, blah blah blah, go on, you roll a leg and signing the
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:10.240]  agreement with the Soviet Union and the Carnegie Corporation role in
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:14.440]  agreements with the Soviet Academy of Science, all these things that again I
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:18.200]  would say the conservatives got to understand this, I hate to say it but
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:21.920]  you have not been informed of these things because the conservatives, let's
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:25.640]  call them neoconservatives, not going to order people, may have been infiltrated,
[02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:30.400]  the Republican Party badly infiltrated by the left, so you've got both parties
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:37.000]  are left and you can call them either socialist or Marxist or fascist,
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.240]  doesn't make any difference, both parties are controlled and that's why we haven't
[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:44.400]  been able to get this information out, what I want you to do is don't get the
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:48.960]  discourage, you've got to keep fighting and the reason I say this is there have
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:52.520]  been many many people and I gave a lot of credit to these people in the beginning
[02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:58.080]  of my book, I've known them, some are dead, etc, they, the insiders expected to
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:03.920]  bring us down certainly in the 80s, that is 1976 200th anniversary, we were meant
[02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:09.040]  to be basically going down, we didn't, we're still here, if those people had
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:13.000]  given up, the ones that you and I know and a lot of us oldsters know they're
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:17.560]  going now magnificent Americans who fought for freedom for the Constitutional,
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:23.200]  if they had given up, I wouldn't even be on this program today and Alice wouldn't
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:29.880]  have a show, so you cannot give up, you have to keep fighting this battle and the
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:34.680]  tool to fight it I think, because of course I love my own book, is my little
[02:36:34.680 --> 02:36:39.800]  book and it's smaller, you can't complain anymore about it, you know, can't take it
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:43.920]  on vacation, it weighs too much, now the other thing I want to say is there's only
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:49.840]  one person out there that we can vote for, for the Republican Party, there's only one person,
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:56.040]  absolutely there's no question about it and it's Ron Paul, it is ridiculous what's
[02:36:56.040 --> 02:36:59.320]  going on now, it's evil what's going on right now, they're doing to him what they
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.360]  did to Goldwater back in the 60s, when they had that film with a little girl in the
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:08.040]  field, the Brutal Poppies and the bomb going off, they're gonna do that to him too,
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:12.240]  yeah they're saying we'll get nuked if you elect Ron Paul, same thing LBJ did,
[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:18.760]  right, so look folks, we've got good stuff out there now, we've got Ron Pag, I'm gonna keep
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:23.080]  fighting, Alex is great, he's gonna keep fighting, well Charlotte as you know, I mean
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.480]  20, 30, 40 years ago almost nobody knew about this stuff, because it was so
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:33.600]  incredible, you mean their tyrants want to slowly take over, now it's all coming
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.440]  fruition, the crop is coming in, we told folks what those plants were gonna grow
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:45.280]  before I was born, you were warning people, and then now we see, oh this is
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:50.640]  tyranny they're setting up, I've never seen such an awakening happening, now some
[02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:55.360]  are awakening, that's happening faster, but others are getting deeper into the
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:38:00.240]  trance and you cannot reach him because they've been so damaged by the brain
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:04.560]  washing, by the chemicals, but it's never a majority that turns things around, it's
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:10.880]  an evil minority or a good minority that are gonna decide the destiny of the
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:15.520]  human species, and our minority is swelling, we are much better than the
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:20.720]  criminals. The young people are so important, let me say don't waste time on
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:26.760]  people my age really, because they are so pathetic, with their golf clubs, their
[02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:30.640]  retirement, I mean they all put that, I'm sorry to say it, maybe there are a few out
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.720]  there who aren't, but don't waste your time on them, put your time into the young
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:40.320]  people getting out of high school and college, get in there just like Ron Paul
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:55.640]  said, there's this huge awakening among young people, and you know what, the schools may have done a good job like I pointed out earlier with 80% or whatever of those college students, but I don't believe it's all about that, I think that the young people
[02:38:55.640 --> 02:39:02.400]  really are beginning to understand that they have been had, well you know they create a
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:06.640]  fake consensus with all these fake polls, I mean they've now, it's even quote
[02:39:06.640 --> 02:39:11.080]  mainstream news, that there was fraud all over Iowa just as we said two three
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:17.200]  days ago, I mean it's just that it's so brazen Charlotte, yes it is, and I think
[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:22.000]  that that's why I think the young people know this, and the other thing is Ron Paul
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:27.920]  really is the anti-war candidate, and if he was smart that's what he would run on
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:31.400]  even though he's anti-federal reserve and he'd love to get rid of the
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:35.720]  Department of Education, he's the only one who's really mentioned that isn't he, his
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:40.720]  platform is superb, and they say it's kooky, don't wait a minute, look I always love it
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:44.880]  when people call me a kook, you know why, and I tell them thank you, because the
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:50.440]  greatest Americans and people in the Soviet Union, etc, all these people who
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:56.680]  cherish freedom, were called kooks at the time, and so some of course your kooks
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:01.600]  thanked them, and say you know you put me in really good company, I'm in with
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:06.280]  Salton, etc, I'm in with all these great people who fought for freedom, well as you
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:12.440]  know Charlotte a doodle dandy was the biggest insult the British could give
[02:40:12.440 --> 02:40:15.880]  each other, and I don't want to tell people what it means, but it's a it's a
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.520]  slang, but and you know what we said good we're gonna have a song called
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:25.600]  Yankee Doodle Dandy, that's very interesting, good to you Alex I didn't know that, but you
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.600]  know the thing is that that's what that is, that's all those guys out there
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:36.000]  hitting on in 1945 at the UN who said they're gonna use psychiatry you know to
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:40.000]  get rid of our conscience, these are the people who said we're crazy see, we're
[02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:45.640]  crazy because we think, because we know that war, we know war is long but we know
[02:40:45.640 --> 02:40:50.280]  that sometimes you have to take a stand, but they don't want us, no no no they teach us
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:56.080]  to not be warlike so they can wage war on us, they say truce, exactly what we are, our
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:02.200]  military is nothing but the United Nations military arm, to control the whole
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:06.400]  world has nothing to do with protecting the United States, and the good part for
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:11.160]  the globalist is when they do all this imperial evil and the massacres their
[02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:16.440]  own globalist media tells the world about it and then blames America and then
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:19.720]  we're domestically told it's great and everybody loves us for the future
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:23.960]  destruction of this country politically, I mean the globalists are such masters
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:27.720]  that they have America doing all their dirty work, I mean Rupert Murdoch's
[02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:32.000]  publications will badmouth the war and stuff overseas, but then domestically he's
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.520]  all for it and again they know exactly what they're doing, they don't play by
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:41.400]  any rules, the book is available at infowars.com with deliberate dumbing down
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.080]  of America, a new edition, a smaller edition, it's been out of print for a

[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.120]  New Year special I've never had to deal this good or he'd run off the rest of
[02:43:39.120 --> 02:43:44.760]  the month because it's getting the word out all 18 of my films on DVD or 9995

[02:43:56.280 --> 02:44:00.600]  continue and hopefully expand and we're really working hard here as you know
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:05.720]  because we understand this this information is too important I mean you
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:10.000]  know I separated some ribs cracked some stuff dropping a big weight on myself
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.320]  last weekend on like an idiot do an incline weight slipped out of my hands
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:18.400]  I was going too fast it came out and most people would be in bed right now and
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:21.360]  I'm not whining about it it's about it I'm not even I'm not doing some great
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:27.480]  service being here I wild horses cannot drag me away I mean I want to do
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:32.320]  productions I want to make films I want to get the word out I want to warn
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:36.240]  people I want to stop these people because it's so frustrating to know
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:40.760]  these are wanton evil criminals that use psychological warfare and false
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:45.680]  reality systems that they've taught people to get a lot of good men and
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:49.840]  women out there to not even ever become conscious human beings and to be mind
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:55.080]  slaves to these globalist and carry out all this evil I don't even hate their
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:44:58.400]  minions anymore I used to really get mad at minions of the system and now I'm
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:03.680]  just like man it's frustrating like I know what I'm talking about I live this
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:08.960]  stuff I read documents till I'm blue in the face I I understand how the system
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:16.760]  works I understand it most most people are not bad and I understand this a lot
[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:19.640]  more than even some of their high-level people because they're all
[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:23.240]  compartmentalized just doing their sector they're trained to do it they do it
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:30.240]  and I've gotten the level of a master architect understanding of the overall
[02:45:30.240 --> 02:45:34.960]  integrated systems of how they run this thing and let me tell you it doesn't
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:40.240]  look like it's human-built I'm not into space aliens reptoids any of that I'm
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:45.280]  just saying it's hard to believe that humans would actually consciously be
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:50.080]  trying to set this up because they're trying to screw up the planet they're
[02:45:50.080 --> 02:45:54.960]  trying to splice every animal and every plant and creating abominations that are
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:58.320]  already causing irrevocable problems they're already got a lot of the key
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:04.680]  species dying out honeybees and things like that it's other top scientists I've
[02:46:04.680 --> 02:46:08.240]  had on it's like then they say it's like it's space aliens that one destroy the
[02:46:08.240 --> 02:46:12.200]  earth or something and then they know that we're concerned about this so they
[02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:15.840]  take over the environmental movement and make it an anti-human anti-carbon
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:23.080]  dioxide movement they are such masters at knowing how you're going to think and
[02:46:23.080 --> 02:46:27.200]  what you're going to do in creating false systems to capture your energy to
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:33.320]  capture your resistance it's just unbelievable and they love hurting good
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.560]  things they love defacing good things they love screwing things up I'm gonna
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:43.840]  start preaching here it's just it's the devil ladies and gentlemen I don't know
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:48.560]  how else to explain it to you but when you get right down to hardcore 18 hour a
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:52.640]  day research you run smack dab up against it the leadership or devil
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:56.160]  worshipers Lucifer worshipers they think Lucifer is God and they're just sick
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:01.680]  freaks they are super smart sick freaks at skull and bones they think they're
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:06.120]  guided by the devil and they worship the devil and ABC News captured it on tape
[02:47:06.120 --> 02:47:12.040]  I mean that's just it's like what in the world are we facing here and they've got
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:17.720]  all these well-meaning people that will go and shoot Iraqi women for almost no
[02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:23.160]  reason and and call them subhuman and think they're good guys that is mind
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:33.560]  control and it's all Skinner it's all Edward Bernays
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:41.320]  if you just read propaganda by Bernays if you just know what I know if you just
[02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:43.880]  read the public club of Rome documents if you just read the Rockefeller
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:47.600]  Foundation documents we linked to where they put stuff in the vaccines in the
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:52.840]  food in the water to give us cancer I mean it's really uncool you know this is
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:56.680]  not about entertainment it's not about a joke people it's not about who I'm a
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:00.400]  radio host and I'm up here talking to you about this stuff this is life and
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:02.680]  death
[02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.400]  it starts with all of us though evil couldn't have gotten away with this if
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.960]  people by increment didn't give into evil and corruption I said I get through a
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:22.920]  bunch of news and look at this financial news doctors going broke under
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.000]  Obamacare but don't worry they just now want to fully nationalize health care
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:33.280]  and take it over that was always the plan CNN top 1% of mobile users consume
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:37.320]  half of world's bandwidth and the gap is growing so they're saying to people
[02:48:37.320 --> 02:48:41.560]  well let us put a charge more charges on you since other people are using too
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:45.680]  much that's just a way to charge everybody more there's articles out
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:48.880]  about they're lying about how many jobs have really been created we've got a big
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.640]  stack of news on that front I already mentioned this but it's big DHS officers
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.000]  armed with semi-automatics set up unannounced ID checkpoints with
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.400]  submachine guns in Florida I mean you just can't make that up
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:07.160]  speaking of genetic engineering I had a big stack of news on that but let me
[02:49:07.160 --> 02:49:12.160]  get to that in a minute when I find it proposed DNA Bank could in snare New
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:16.080]  York graffiti artist and it just goes through England already does this in
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.280]  many cities you get pulled over for speed and they take your your DNA out of
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:24.200]  the cheek they can just swab it they put it in the database of course to frame
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:28.320]  you it's it's not the cop doing it doesn't know that but but it's mainly to
[02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:31.800]  frame you and get your me they take your blood at birth for 40 years worldwide
[02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:35.120]  every everywhere it's under the global system there's a few countries are
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:38.760]  mopping up and don't worry they fly over there and spray stuff on them they're
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:42.280]  not getting away with anything they're gonna be mutated murdered by these
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:47.480]  criminals just as we just devil ghouls we're dealing with there's that report
[02:49:47.480 --> 02:49:58.040]  out of some Reuters we've got I'm digging up my reporter the problems I've got
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:01.920]  too much news this is just totally insane I got a whole stack of news here
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:06.880]  about genetic engineering and stuff here it is welcome to a brave new world
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:12.160]  genetic scientists create franken freakish man-made monster ants with huge
[02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:16.240]  heads and jaws I'm gonna cover this on the nightly news tonight here's another
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:21.280]  one meet the Chimera monkey this is Daily Mail made from the cells of six

[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:33.080]  creates I mean folks it's gonna start now not being cancer at 2000 percent or
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:36.840]  3000 percent what it was 50 years ago it's gonna start being just everybody
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:42.360]  dying around you are being cut up and sliced up as the whole financial system
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:46.520]  goes bankrupt by design and the medical system goes bankrupt which is designed
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:51.680]  to do they create the medical crisis soft killing everybody then it collapses
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:56.120]  then you got government-run health care which will deliver the murdering system

[02:54:13.840 --> 02:54:20.800]  you the schools across the country are admittedly watching kids at home on
[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:25.920]  their laptops I mentioned this earlier big brother in st. Louis schools plan to
[02:54:25.920 --> 02:54:30.200]  monitor students activity at home with these medical wristbands all the
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:33.320]  students tracking their heart rates everything just training you that you're
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:38.400]  a prisoner and to see if the parents will go along with it and now California is
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:43.960]  in is inoculating school students without parental consent and we've caught
[02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:47.600]  schools before doing it and claiming it's an accident they take your blood at
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:51.560]  birth and tell you it's for a blood test and their liars and they're caught
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.640]  lying and they were just saying Alex you haven't mentioned the article about how
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:01.800]  the new windows coming out won't have a mouse it'll be eye tracked well
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:07.280]  absolutely what do you think the connect put out by Microsoft does it's a face
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:15.000]  scan see see the technology all is it's not even a trojan horse the reason you
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.360]  think you have a computer the reason you think you go on Google is the side
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:27.280]  vestigial reason it's all designed to track and control you Microsoft said a
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:31.760]  decade ago that they're gonna have an internet ID by law but before that it
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:35.240]  won't matter because you're gonna thumb print and face scan to activate your
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:41.320]  computer it will not turn on now even local banks are trying to pressure us
[02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:44.960]  when we get wires in from advertisers or we're gonna wire money or something to
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:51.000]  do a voice print deal not even a code or not even a I mean it's just it and then
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:57.040]  again they can tax and trace and and and shut you down they can put any fees
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:01.640]  they want on you it's a system where you're like a rat in a big computerized
[02:56:01.640 --> 02:56:07.480]  maze and then now I see all the big Republican talk show house freaking out
[02:56:07.480 --> 02:56:12.720]  over Obama saying I'll just have you know I'll just appoint judges now in
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:15.920]  America they're saying but you this has never been done before that these
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:19.640]  aren't recess appointments we're not in recess these are permanent appointments
[02:56:19.640 --> 02:56:24.120]  remember the quote believe me the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:29.000]  remember Bush things it'd be a heck of a lot easier this is a dictator ship just
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.040]  so long as I'm the dictator remember that you can pull that up I mean it's
[02:56:36.040 --> 02:56:44.600]  it's open creepiness in your face beyond what you could even imagine and it's
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.880]  just gonna get more insane from here on out and you're like well at least we're
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:50.560]  on the air talking about it yeah now they're talking about shutting people
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.600]  down I mean it's everyone going along with this we're destroying ourselves
[02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:59.520]  that's what's so frustrating 99% of people are are compartmentalized they
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:02.840]  may even hate the New World Order but you still go along with it because it's
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:08.040]  all around you we've got to start really realizing this is the big issue this is
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:13.520]  everything all the other stuff the football the dramas it's all drama
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:17.880]  we're under attack let's get conscious to it the globalists know that if it's
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:24.280]  incremental do you think a deer here's an analogy would walk out into a beautiful
[02:57:24.280 --> 02:57:27.640]  green field if it knew that the whole field was a giant bear trap I just thought
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:33.640]  of a graphic of that it's the same thing of like a well upon being poisoned
[02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:36.760]  where deer come to drink they don't taste the poison they're going to drink it
[02:57:36.760 --> 02:57:40.480]  and all die it's because it's not in your face but now it is in your face
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:46.920]  because it grew slowly like the frog in the pot people are almost totally wide
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:50.240]  open to it and it's almost like a deer look you know the public's a deer walking
[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:54.840]  out into a field and you see the whole field slam shut it's a giant Venus fly
[02:57:54.840 --> 02:58:00.280]  trap you know and the trees and stuff for just its teeth and like there's the
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:05.040]  the meadow and the deer walks out it's slam shut on it and then it's a whole
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:09.520]  other vista you're looking at I mean I mean it's like that it's like you people
[02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:14.960]  just see this is real the system and then and lies stacked on lies and it's all a
[02:58:14.960 --> 02:58:18.960]  giant illusion I got to do five minutes of overdrive because I said I'd get to
[02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:23.880]  this most stations won't carry this but it'll be on infowars.com audio streams
[02:58:23.880 --> 02:58:27.680]  and the video streams we have up there now and I'll be on the night nightly
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:30.760]  news you've got a 15-day free trial right now if you want to support us and
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:34.840]  also see the news and then you download it and give it to your friends I'm gonna
[02:58:34.840 --> 02:58:39.240]  come back and get into Obama and saying he basically wants to be our supreme
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:52.920]  ruler. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today. Hundreds of
[02:58:52.920 --> 02:58:57.120]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[02:58:57.120 --> 02:59:02.120]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda they'll be
[02:59:02.120 --> 02:59:05.760]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've termed members
[02:59:05.760 --> 02:59:10.800]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I
[02:59:10.800 --> 02:59:16.160]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full
[02:59:16.160 --> 02:59:20.440]  of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short
[02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:25.200]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:29.240]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists they're asking for more
[02:59:29.240 --> 02:59:33.160]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems
[02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:38.800]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:44.800]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or
[02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:52.440]  watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. Coast to
[02:59:52.440 --> 02:59:58.720]  coast direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:04.320]  Network.
[03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:09.440]  So the system tells us we can secretly arrest you. We can torture everyone. We
[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:13.960]  can launch wars and we'll just say they aren't wars.
[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:22.440]  Welcome to where time stands still. No one leaves and no one will. It is the
[03:00:22.440 --> 03:00:27.320]  inmates running the asylum and look at these headlines at infowars.com. The
[03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:36.200]  dictator wants to bypass Congress. The people cheer and we've got a little clip
[03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:39.440]  at Glenn Beck who's been halfway endorsing Ron Paul lately because he
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:43.760]  knows where his bread is buttered. Has assembled a video montage that includes
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:47.760]  President Obama making references on numerous occasions to bypassing Congress
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:51.240]  in order to push forward his agenda and we've done videos like that as well.
[03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:56.520]  Rather than outrage over President's desire to ignore his oath to preserve
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:01.600]  and protect and defend the Constitution the masses cheer. Yeah he's been beta
[03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:05.520]  tested the last few years where he said you know Congress is in my way. I wish I
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:10.920]  didn't have them there and they're like yay ignore them. Be our dictator. Give us
[03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:19.480]  Barabbas. Give us Eva. We've got a clip of Obama. Real clear politics one of
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:22.800]  these clips. I have an obligation as president to do what I can do without
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:29.480]  Congress and boy you're doing it. Let's go ahead and play it. These are ideas that
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:33.240]  I support from Democrats. They have support from Republicans around the
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:37.160]  country. Independence around the country. I want to work with Congress to get them
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:47.720]  done. But when Congress refuses to act and as a result hurts our economy and
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:53.240]  puts our people at risk. Then I have an obligation as president to do what I can
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:02:02.800]  without them. I mean I should have led the show without today. I mean that is
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:06.880]  such a big deal. In fact Jaren remind me on Sunday I'll be live this Sunday 4 to
[03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:14.480]  6. Will you please assemble all those clips we can. The one Becky Poo has but
[03:02:14.480 --> 03:02:18.040]  just find the originals. I know I know dude's got a bunch. We played him a few
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:20.640]  weeks ago. I mean we need we need to talk about this. I mean this is getting
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:26.040]  creepier and creepier. If they don't act it's this idea of Congress needs to get
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:29.920]  more done. No the founders said separation of powers. You want gridlock. You
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:33.920]  don't want government that just can do whatever it wants. So the idea is if they
[03:02:33.920 --> 03:02:38.280]  fail to act I'll do whatever I want. You're the executive that's given the
[03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:44.200]  laws to execute them. You're like an executive at a company with a share
[03:02:44.200 --> 03:02:52.440]  holders and the shareholders represent the population and the Congress is the
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:57.600]  representative of the shareholders. The Congress makes law and Congress is
[03:02:57.600 --> 03:03:02.520]  pretty much bought and paid for. I mean they just gave the president the power
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:07.600]  to secretly arrest, torture, attack any country he wants. You know the biggest
[03:03:07.600 --> 03:03:11.200]  part of NDAA isn't just the bestiality weirdness and the rest of it and if you
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:16.920]  just tuned in yeah it legalizes that too on the military basis. Look I didn't
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:20.280]  believe it either when I heard it. You can go look it up. I'm not joking. Believe
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:24.880]  me it's just it's we're living in twilight zone here. I mean even if they're
[03:03:24.880 --> 03:03:28.920]  into that in the government why put it in the law? I mean it's just they're
[03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:34.240]  crazy. They're crazy. These are crazy people. It's you know because they do
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:38.760]  what they do but that's not the issue. The issue is that worldwide battlefield
[03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:43.600]  statement and now they've got all these civilians dropping drone bombs killing
[03:03:43.600 --> 03:03:46.240]  people and now they say they're gonna have the drones operating on their own.
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:52.840]  No human killing people that's already happening and they give the drone
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:58.760]  operators medals and stuff. It's just beyond sickening and all of this
[03:03:58.760 --> 03:04:02.760]  distance killing, all of this end of the conscience, end of critical thinking.
[03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:06.680]  We're gonna enter a new dark age of humankind that is gonna make anything
[03:04:06.680 --> 03:04:14.600]  we've seen look tame rather than in a science fiction land and again it is
[03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:19.360]  all going to accelerate right now and soon we want to be able to use computers
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:24.400]  in here. I won't be able to have a mouse. It's gonna have to face scan me and watch
[03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:28.000]  my eyes. They've had that for decades. Remember when I was led into the
[03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:32.360]  University of Texas psychology department all DARPA funded like 90% of it
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:37.760]  and it was just all for control just everything. They're studying every tiny
[03:04:37.760 --> 03:04:41.680]  minutia integrating it with supercomputers how to manipulate you.
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:45.800]  Monkeys with wires in their brains testing the perfect flicker rate to
[03:04:45.800 --> 03:04:50.080]  mesmerize you when you watch the blue mist in the background on Fox News. I
[03:04:50.080 --> 03:04:55.560]  mean it's just total L released by elitist who are willing to do anything
[03:04:55.560 --> 03:05:00.160]  to get live extension technologies and kill us. See you back tonight 7 o'clock
[03:05:00.160 --> 03:05:02.720]  back Sunday.
