[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.600]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.600 --> 00:31.200]  jones just look at these headlines at info wars dot com trump bush knew in
[00:31.200 --> 00:38.560]  advance 9-11 was coming well trump knows that was in the new york post and the
[00:38.560 --> 00:44.080]  new york times just weeks after 9-11 it came out there was advanced knowledge
[00:44.080 --> 00:48.320]  and then years later the memo came out the connelisa rice did have specifics
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.840]  and was told not to fly the day of 9-11 the day before she even called willy
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.720]  brown then mayor of san francisco and told him not to fly and then i would
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.040]  hold up the san francisco chronicle or the new york post and sit with
[01:04.040 --> 01:08.800]  headlines bush knew and they would have national media claim that i was saying
[01:08.800 --> 01:14.120]  that bush blew up the towers i don't know what bush specifically did i know
[01:14.120 --> 01:18.560]  there were bombs in building 7 and it fell at freefall speeds which even this
[01:18.560 --> 01:22.960]  just had to admit now after what was it eight nine years of them denying it
[01:22.960 --> 01:28.680]  they started admitting it about five years ago so that's a big deal we've
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.880]  got donald trump's comments coming up we've got the comments by jeb bush
[01:32.880 --> 01:38.480]  responding but to have trumps say things like this he's seen as a right
[01:38.480 --> 01:43.120]  winger and they have a lot of trouble attacking a darling of the GOP for 9
[01:43.120 --> 01:51.360]  11 truthing but as i said last sunday 9 11 truth would bring down the bush
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.920]  family just like this new memo that came out over the weekend that's added to
[01:55.920 --> 01:59.520]  several others the downing street in the white house memo a new memo confirmed
[01:59.520 --> 02:04.800]  to be accurate but the daily mail got where they said we know saddam wasn't
[02:04.800 --> 02:09.640]  involved in 9 11 we're gonna fix intelligence ahead of a war next year to
[02:09.640 --> 02:15.480]  basically blaming on saddam hussein that's a very serious war crime the truth
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.520]  is saddam hussein it was an angel cake compared to people like al qaeda and
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.040]  isis and the people that run saudi arabia he was part of a earlier us
[02:27.040 --> 02:32.240]  policy to stabilize the middle east and bring freedom to a certain extent there
[02:32.240 --> 02:37.640]  and he followed his orders of course to attack in a seven-year war the iranians
[02:37.640 --> 02:42.480]  he followed his orders to go ahead and invade kawait and he was set up at that
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.560]  point hung out to dry i'm not saying saddam hussein was a good guy hitler
[02:47.560 --> 02:51.640]  was a bad guy but he was set up by british intelligence he had a secret
[02:51.640 --> 02:58.040]  treaty with him that's come out with the deputy furor rudolf s that's why he
[02:58.040 --> 03:03.920]  later parachuted into edward the eighths home a state with the treaty in his hand
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.960]  that's why they locked him up in the tower of london that's right the vice
[03:07.960 --> 03:14.000]  president of germany the deputy furor parachuted and he was a world war one
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.680]  ace jumped out and skydived into edward the eighths palace with the treaty
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.880]  thinking that stunt would it didn't do anything for him you got locked up
[03:25.880 --> 03:33.360]  immediately so that's how this stuff works hitlers like you told me i could
[03:33.360 --> 03:36.600]  have france you told me we were gonna link up and attack russia what are you
[03:36.600 --> 03:42.920]  doing giving russia weapons that's why you always hear hitler was delusional in
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.880]  the bunker and thought any minute the west would join up with the nazis and
[03:46.880 --> 03:50.040]  take out the russians that's because they kept telling them that was the plan
[03:50.040 --> 03:54.320]  that was the plan don't hit us with all your forces we're gonna double cross the
[03:54.320 --> 04:01.240]  russians in berlin that's why it's come out that church hill wanted to do the
[04:01.240 --> 04:06.640]  unthinkable use what was left of the german army to fight the russians at
[04:06.640 --> 04:12.040]  the end of world war two you could pull up these articles that's why then
[04:12.040 --> 04:18.240]  deputy furor hindrick himmler about two weeks for the nazis finally surrendered
[04:18.240 --> 04:24.680]  but we can have actually he actually showed up and surrendered and they
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.880]  cyanide at him they weren't gonna let him get to any nurenberg trial he had the
[04:29.880 --> 04:33.560]  peace treaty he said let's link up and beat the russians right now and they
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.520]  said how about you take a little capsule sweetie cake and then of course
[04:37.520 --> 04:41.040]  patin freaked out because he knew there was a deal to link up with the nazis
[04:41.040 --> 04:44.240]  and take out the russians he thought the russians were worse than the nazis they
[04:44.240 --> 04:49.720]  said how about we just shoot you in the side of the head at a train stop and
[04:49.720 --> 04:54.000]  then that didn't tell him so they had to go visiting minutes inside the hospital
[04:54.000 --> 04:58.960]  in the course he didn't make it out did he i'm sorry a little history lesson want

[08:47.760 --> 08:53.120]  well my friends it's another live worldwide broadcast on this Tuesday the
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.760]  20th day of October 2015 I am your host Alex Jones we're going to be here for
[08:58.760 --> 09:05.440]  the next three hours Lord willing we have Dr. Steven Pechenick joining us in
[09:05.440 --> 09:11.400]  the third hour the co-author of many of Tom Clancy's books the head of
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.880]  psychological warfare operations for the State Department a very shadowy
[09:15.880 --> 09:23.800]  character who only appears on this show now for 14 years and he's got quite a
[09:23.800 --> 09:33.120]  bit to join us on today he says that Oregon was the false flag and of course
[09:33.120 --> 09:38.600]  he said a decade before Obama rolled out the dead body of bin Laden he said
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.360]  that that would be done down the road by a future president and then off of his
[09:43.360 --> 09:50.400]  statements Walter Cronkite and then Secretary of State Madeline Albright
[09:50.400 --> 09:57.240]  went on Larry King live in two separate shows in 2004 during the
[09:57.240 --> 10:03.360]  presidential election and said Bush has been laden's dead body on ice and is
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.560]  going to roll it out during the election so we're here to stop it and so
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.000]  instead that ended up happening later and and has now been admitted Seymour
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.800]  Hirsch two times Pulitzer Prize winner of course is documented what we
[10:17.800 --> 10:26.040]  documented years before that bin Laden had died of kidney failure in 2002 he
[10:26.040 --> 10:33.120]  been treated at the American Hospital in Dubai and had reportedly died in 2002
[10:33.120 --> 10:38.960]  that had even been in CBS news and the CIA had visited him so he's the perfect
[10:38.960 --> 10:44.240]  boogeyman someone that's dead but that can be resurrected but Channingson to
[10:44.240 --> 10:50.600]  cover the waterfront in fact he sent me issues he wants to get into let me just
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.080]  tell you some of these and then Joel Scowson of World Affairs brief of course
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.880]  will be joining us on the economy on the military on the Russia escalation
[10:58.880 --> 11:07.800]  that's really over the top in Syria we're going to talk about it again the
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.920]  whole bin Laden hoax another false flag in Oregon just like Newtown a major war
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.400]  will start between Israel and Palestine and he wants to talk about the speaker
[11:16.400 --> 11:22.880]  of the House race and Daniel Webster who I've been supporting I know Walter
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.880]  Jones is supporting him but that's coming up with Scowson will cover the
[11:27.880 --> 11:38.160]  rapid Russian Iranian offensive in Syria Canada's turn to the left as famous
[11:38.160 --> 11:45.400]  Prime Minister son has now been elected Trudeau the second and we'll look at the
[11:45.400 --> 11:54.040]  politics of Trump and Carson with Joel Scowson coming up today before we are
[11:54.040 --> 12:04.280]  joined by dr. Steve Pacinic obviously we've got massive news on the
[12:04.280 --> 12:11.760]  implosion of the borders by design we're gonna be getting to all of that we
[12:11.760 --> 12:22.480]  are going to be getting into the economic news that is so serious I really
[12:22.480 --> 12:31.640]  have trouble even coming up with sensational enough words to describe the
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.960]  different scenarios that could happen during the deleveraging and the
[12:35.960 --> 12:41.800]  unraveling of all of this fraudulent debt that we have been married to that we
[12:41.800 --> 12:48.240]  have been welded to that we have been spliced into and the clear mass
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.960]  preparations for classical totalitarianism all over the western world using
[12:53.960 --> 12:59.520]  the global meltdown as the pretext to really put the final nails in our
[12:59.520 --> 13:08.160]  beloved enlightenment that's all coming up also we're sending Leanne
[13:08.160 --> 13:14.800]  McAdoo there I in just a few days she wants to go she lived in St. Louis for
[13:14.800 --> 13:21.240]  many years knows the area officials squabble as underground fire burns near
[13:21.240 --> 13:27.160]  radioactive waste dump in St. Louis area I say she wants to go I wouldn't
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.120]  normally send my reporters to landfills burning next to radioactive waste dumps
[13:32.120 --> 13:35.800]  because believe me if it's already gotten into the radioactive areas they're
[13:35.800 --> 13:40.680]  not gonna tell you even when the levels of radiation go up the policy is just
[13:40.680 --> 13:45.000]  ignore it so we're gonna bring field monitor and a Geiger counter they're
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.960]  two separate things up there both calibrated and just investigate exactly
[13:51.960 --> 13:58.040]  what's going on Josh Owens is going as well he's pretty much like a wartime
[13:58.040 --> 14:04.440]  correspondent the things he's seen so that's all coming up also Ted Cruz says
[14:04.440 --> 14:08.400]  he cannot overstate the threats to internet freedom independent news
[14:08.400 --> 14:15.160]  websites like drudge yeah the Supreme Court is gearing up to restrict free
[14:15.160 --> 14:22.360]  speech and top conservative Supreme Court justice I think you can guess who
[14:22.360 --> 14:27.480]  told drudge yet dinner in front of other famous people that they're coming for
[14:27.480 --> 14:30.560]  the First Amendment they've told us they are we're gonna fight them as hard as
[14:30.560 --> 14:34.320]  we can but we don't have the votes they plan in the next two years this was a
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.960]  six months ago to end free speech as we know it basically it's just horrible
[14:40.960 --> 14:47.000]  we're in the hands of total evil so that's all coming up
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.200]  Obamacare I mentioned this yesterday but when it was in UPI and stuff but it's
[14:52.200 --> 15:00.440]  an AP today Obamacare uninsured penalty jumps to 695 dollars to push
[15:00.440 --> 15:05.840]  enrollment yeah but for business owners even if you have like five employees
[15:05.840 --> 15:13.240]  it's $5,000 believe me I have CPAs I have tax lawyers I have 49 employees and
[15:13.240 --> 15:19.440]  six contractors I got what 55 crew members basically and believe me I live
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.680]  under this every day I know the penalties are now rolling in because
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.840]  none of my crew wants it they want to be paid they want to go out and get their
[15:26.840 --> 15:32.600]  own insurance they get paid to go get their own insurance they want to make
[15:32.600 --> 15:39.560]  their own choice and remember the headlines four years ago three years ago
[15:39.560 --> 15:48.800]  two years ago Matt Drudge is a liar there is no penalty in the bill well the
[15:48.800 --> 15:55.560]  penalty is as high as $5,000 per person but can be administered and it can even
[15:55.560 --> 16:00.000]  hire per business but the highest we've seen is $5,000 fines on small businesses
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.040]  so far it can be in the hundreds of thousands for larger businesses and they
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.520]  just come out and say no there are no there are no fines and then they hired
[16:11.520 --> 16:23.040]  7,000 and then they hired another 11,000 what is that 18,000 IRS workers full
[16:23.040 --> 16:29.280]  time two years ago just to go after people that don't get Obamacare
[16:29.280 --> 16:38.080]  remember the White House in 2014 in March Liberty tax White House media
[16:38.080 --> 16:42.720]  attack after Drudge pays Obamacare opt-out penalty and they responded by
[16:42.720 --> 16:56.520]  saying there is no penalty but they're in the Associated Press saying we're
[16:56.520 --> 17:02.040]  upping the individual penalty from $400 to $695 and that's just an arbitrary
[17:02.040 --> 17:06.920]  number the IRS just threw out there ignorant White House staffer liberal
[17:06.920 --> 17:13.520]  media slam drudges Liberty tax claim remember that I mean those aren't even
[17:13.520 --> 17:18.720]  the good headlines is the headlines drudge lying about Obama penalty there is
[17:18.720 --> 17:25.360]  not a penalty I'm not here plugging drudge because he links to us and because
[17:25.360 --> 17:28.480]  he came and visited a few weeks ago I mean it's this is the guy they're
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.840]  attacking this is what they do they wrote articles years ago about info wars
[17:32.840 --> 17:36.900]  and drudge and Kurt Nemo and myself saying we're liars there are no domestic
[17:36.900 --> 17:40.520]  drones they're not watching farmers they're not watching people that build
[17:40.520 --> 17:46.440]  new barns even though we were linking to mainstream regional newspapers in our
[17:46.440 --> 17:52.000]  articles see this is the level of deception we deal with I mean it is just
[17:52.000 --> 18:04.920]  insane it is totally and completely insane and the way they've got these tax
[18:04.920 --> 18:07.680]  laws written the IRS won't give you advice you could have started
[18:07.680 --> 18:11.040]  voluntarily paying these fines if you didn't get it two years ago they said
[18:11.040 --> 18:14.760]  fine don't get it pay the fine well then you're supposed to get Obamacare so you
[18:14.760 --> 18:18.720]  say okay I'll pay the fine they go there is no fine but it's but it's
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.400]  statutorily right here and then now they're going you know what it is there
[18:23.400 --> 18:28.040]  everybody's got to pay it but they think you don't have a memory we're gonna go to
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.800]  break and come back with the really big news Donald Trump said he would have
[18:30.800 --> 18:34.900]  prevented 9-11 at the Bush's knew it was coming which is absolutely true so we've
[18:34.900 --> 18:38.560]  got there back and forth there this is really bombshell this could bring down

[25:51.000 --> 25:58.520]  Trump responding back but if you want to know why this society is in so much
[25:58.520 --> 26:02.440]  trouble it's because people have become removed from the land people have
[26:02.440 --> 26:09.440]  become domesticated myself included and the world has gotten so complex that
[26:09.440 --> 26:24.080]  corruption can hide behind it and now the corrupt know they're bringing down the
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.520]  system and that things are untenable and that things will collapse and most the
[26:28.520 --> 26:31.920]  world's already in collapse most the world's already in total bedlam right
[26:31.920 --> 26:40.880]  now total bedlam and so the system has upped the criminality and is just
[26:40.880 --> 26:46.120]  robbing everything they've already stolen the societal furniture the family
[26:46.120 --> 26:50.720]  jewels the treasure now they're pulling up the floorboards they're pulling out
[26:50.720 --> 26:56.640]  the chandeliers they're pulling down the curtains and they're even ripping the
[26:56.640 --> 27:04.280]  wallpaper off they're even pulling the nails out of the studs they're tearing
[27:04.280 --> 27:10.520]  down the chimneys filling up their wagons and running off over the hill and
[27:10.520 --> 27:14.320]  the general public stomping around like a bunch of zombies not having any idea
[27:14.320 --> 27:20.920]  how hard they just got screwed over I told folks for over a year I've had a
[27:20.920 --> 27:27.240]  sense of approaching dread and it's gone from a distant drumbeat to a banging
[27:27.240 --> 27:33.760]  crescendo and now the drum beats gone and I'm just in silence with world
[27:33.760 --> 27:37.760]  government being announced and the enemy launching all its operations at once
[27:37.760 --> 27:47.120]  against free humanity and we're just in the stillness and the kingdom of the
[27:47.120 --> 27:54.640]  empire the sun has set we're now inside the beginning of the world government
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.080]  and all the abominations of the enemy are just paraded around in front of us
[27:59.080 --> 28:05.160]  and nobody gets in trouble nobody goes to jail nobody gets indicted except the
[28:05.160 --> 28:11.680]  innocent and I asked myself what's coming next
[28:11.680 --> 28:20.400]  but I don't want to be negative here the number show massive awakening the
[28:20.400 --> 28:26.920]  number show people are resisting but the population would resist a lot more if
[28:26.920 --> 28:38.200]  they had an idea just how dire the straights are that we're in I'd like to
[28:38.200 --> 28:45.640]  think I'm a pretty tough guy I'd like to think I can handle a lot of stress and I
[28:45.640 --> 28:53.520]  can but I take one look at the general public how soft and stupid they are and
[28:53.520 --> 29:01.320]  let me tell you something I get scared I'm not scared of Jack Butch dragging me
[29:01.320 --> 29:05.320]  off and put me in some jail cell that could happen but that's just part of
[29:05.320 --> 29:11.160]  life they're evil they know who they are they know who they serve but I look at
[29:11.160 --> 29:16.800]  the general public they don't have any idea who they are who their daddy is who
[29:16.800 --> 29:20.760]  their mommy is they know who their daddy and mommy is figuratively but they
[29:20.760 --> 29:28.600]  don't really know we're in the middle of this fantastic universe hurtling through
[29:28.600 --> 29:32.480]  space 30 something thousand miles an hour and these people really think

[34:15.920 --> 34:26.560]  where to begin where to start let's get into Donald Trump saying he would have
[34:26.560 --> 34:33.080]  prevented 9-11 and coming out and saying bush new well if you guys document cam
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.840]  for me that the story and video is up on info wars.com I can show TV viewers
[34:37.840 --> 34:47.600]  Google and if you just type in bush new just b-u-s-h-k-n-e-w you get eighty four
[34:47.600 --> 34:56.360]  million two hundred thousand plus results in 0.71 seconds so in less than a
[34:56.360 --> 35:04.800]  second you get a 84 million responses plus and what you mainly get is the
[35:04.800 --> 35:15.800]  cover of the New York Post and you also get the New York Times and you get the
[35:15.800 --> 35:23.880]  billboards around the country you know Bush did 9-11 stuff like that and what
[35:23.880 --> 35:30.480]  what needs to be known here what needs to be understood here is that it did come
[35:30.480 --> 35:36.120]  out in the State Department memos it did come out in congressional testimony
[35:36.120 --> 35:40.560]  both public testimony and secret testimony in the 9-11 Commission and
[35:40.560 --> 35:43.920]  we've had members of that Commission on this show by the way we've had members
[35:43.920 --> 35:50.840]  of Congress on the breakdown the 28 pages that was redacted bare minimum
[35:50.840 --> 35:57.560]  norad stood down ran a drill to confuse the FAA and the pilots of norad and the
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.640]  Saudi Arabian 15 of the 19 hijackers were trained at US military bases and
[36:02.640 --> 36:06.840]  thought they were taking part in a drill a gas was released on at least two of
[36:06.840 --> 36:11.000]  the aircraft because the real air phone calls not the fake calls the FBI admits
[36:11.000 --> 36:15.480]  to their credit were not made by the solicitor general's wife Ted Olson all
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.480]  that that didn't happen she didn't call there were no records they went and
[36:19.480 --> 36:23.680]  checked her phone didn't work at 35,000 feet it wasn't true there were two air
[36:23.680 --> 36:30.280]  phone calls from two different passenger jets you can look this up both
[36:30.280 --> 36:36.280]  female stewardesses saying they've taken over we're told they've got a bomb we
[36:36.280 --> 36:44.840]  can't breathe gas gas gas smoke smoke as best we can tell whoever really hijacked
[36:44.840 --> 36:48.840]  the jets by remote control had some dummies on board taking part in a drill
[36:48.840 --> 36:53.960]  we know that they've been drilling before that's what James Woods saw four
[36:53.960 --> 36:58.680]  guys practicing hijacking he gets off at a connection says hey these guys are
[36:58.680 --> 37:01.640]  acting like they were gonna hijack the plane FBI shows up goes this is
[37:01.640 --> 37:08.400]  national security don't tell anyone what you just saw they were trained at the
[37:08.400 --> 37:12.000]  defense language school they were trained in California they were trained
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.160]  at bases in Florida this all came out in mainstream news and I would just sit
[37:17.160 --> 37:20.920]  here on air at the time and show the stacks of articles and go there should
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.880]  be an investigation and their response is Alex Jones says they planted bombs in
[37:25.880 --> 37:29.600]  the buildings and that Bush you detonated them himself from a flying
[37:29.600 --> 37:34.560]  saucer in space they would actually say that I said flying saucers blew up the
[37:34.560 --> 37:39.840]  towers when I was simply saying hey the globalist stood to gain they launched a
[37:39.840 --> 37:43.920]  war against Iraq and nothing to do with it I've had the former head of the visa
[37:43.920 --> 37:48.560]  section mr. Springman on who said they were ordered to let them back into the
[37:48.560 --> 37:53.480]  country even though they were listed as terrorist Mohammed Atta and others there
[37:53.480 --> 37:57.200]  is a cover-up and then I had the former head of German intelligence on
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.640]  Andres von Bülow I had all these whistleblowers on I had C. Bell Edmonds on
[38:02.640 --> 38:11.080]  first basically the FBI translator at the NSA and she testified secretly to
[38:11.080 --> 38:15.960]  Congress but she broke her gag order in a letter and then on this show very
[38:15.960 --> 38:20.520]  risky to do that for her and us we did it talk about sticking your neck out
[38:20.520 --> 38:24.160]  there I'm not bragging I'm just saying we don't play games around here that's
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.360]  one reason we're so successful and so famous is that we think they don't want
[38:28.360 --> 38:32.480]  to indict us for stuff like that because it bring too much attention to the fact
[38:32.480 --> 38:36.160]  of their criminal activity and we are protected under whistleblower loss and
[38:36.160 --> 38:40.720]  the press certainly is but Obama has persecuted more members of the press than
[38:40.720 --> 38:46.480]  anybody in US history before him I'm not going to get off into the whole 9-11
[38:46.480 --> 38:51.680]  universe because it's so much evidence it'll make your head spin and most of
[38:51.680 --> 38:56.560]  you've looked into it for yourselves but we don't need to prove how they took
[38:56.560 --> 39:00.800]  down Building 7 even though they went on BBC and announced it had fallen before
[39:00.800 --> 39:05.040]  it fell and then the BBC said that that footage was fake that we made it up and
[39:05.040 --> 39:08.240]  they said no it was real footage that they were told by Reuters it had fallen
[39:08.240 --> 39:13.720]  in its own footprint 27 minutes before it fell then I interviewed the deputy
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.400]  head of emergency management Barry Jennings two weeks later he was dead he
[39:18.400 --> 39:21.880]  said no there were bombs in 7 they said get out we're gonna bring it down we
[39:21.880 --> 39:25.920]  have Larry Silverstein on PBS saying we gave the order to pull the building gave
[39:25.920 --> 39:33.200]  the order and watched it come down I have the deputy head of emergency
[39:33.200 --> 39:36.760]  management saying they told them there were bombs in there get out I have two
[39:36.760 --> 39:42.400]  cops that have been on the show who were there on CNN saying get back they're
[39:42.400 --> 39:49.240]  bringing it down who had their radios with the 10-second countdown from FEMA and
[39:49.240 --> 39:54.640]  again black ops will use a cutout group yes he was running FEMA that first day
[39:54.640 --> 40:02.400]  and who was in control the radios it was the Red Cross you want to quit and
[40:02.400 --> 40:06.920]  the media spun it Alex says the cops blew it up Alex says the firemen blew it
[40:06.920 --> 40:12.320]  up no I didn't they're the ones that came on this show including deputy fire
[40:12.320 --> 40:20.200]  chiefs and fire inspectors top people just type in New York firefighter
[40:20.200 --> 40:24.000]  exposes 9-11 as an inside job and you can see a senior New York firefighter
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.160]  talked to Leigh Ann McAdoo about the bombs the molten lava steel all the
[40:30.160 --> 40:37.000]  firefighters knew it was blown up I mean I'd be in New York two years after it
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.080]  happened have the firefighters on the anniversary saluting us saying you're
[40:40.080 --> 40:43.920]  right keep it up and then I'd have the cops going how dare you say we work
[40:43.920 --> 40:50.480]  without Kyla and blew it up I'll kick your butt now six seven years after 9-11
[40:50.480 --> 40:53.800]  the cops weren't getting on our faces anymore there it is 9-11 firefighter
[40:53.800 --> 41:00.320]  blows WTC cover up wide open Leigh Ann McAdoo interviews Rudy did 38 year veteran
[41:00.320 --> 41:06.920]  of New York Fire Department in the New York Police Department and he was a
[41:06.920 --> 41:11.880]  deputy chief they got like what 14 of them in New York but he was one of them
[41:11.880 --> 41:19.640]  and a chief fire inspector so what he says about a fire is absolutely seen as
[41:19.640 --> 41:25.480]  expert witness you know watch the interview but I digress it's hard to
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.240]  scratch the surface on 9-11 and then not get deeper into it we know Conalisa
[41:31.240 --> 41:34.960]  Rice called Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco at the time the day before
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.680]  San Francisco Chronicles September 11th and said do not fly to New York tomorrow
[41:39.680 --> 41:42.880]  we know the Joint Chiefs of Staff canceled the trip to New York one week
[41:42.880 --> 41:47.280]  before and canceled their flights we know Bush Sr. was meeting with the head of
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.160]  the Bin Laden family at a Carlisle Group function at the Carlisle Table the same
[41:52.160 --> 41:58.080]  table in DC when the attacks took place you know when all other air traffic was
[41:58.080 --> 42:07.160]  grounded more than 11 flights with the Bin Laden's from Florida to Virginia to
[42:07.160 --> 42:11.080]  New York were allowed out of the country to get out of the nation and to fly
[42:11.080 --> 42:15.720]  around the country picking up their family members before they absconded
[42:15.720 --> 42:21.720]  you only to continue here because there's a lot other news I haven't gotten to
[42:21.720 --> 42:30.480]  obviously let's go ahead and go to this clip with Jeb Bush trying to act like
[42:30.480 --> 42:35.600]  it's shocking that Donald Trump would say that Bush knew well it's come out
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.960]  Conalisa Rice had the memo Al Qaeda learning to hijack planes to fly him
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.400]  into large buildings targets in New York DC and other areas determined to
[42:46.400 --> 42:53.440]  attack in near future end of line and she got up before Congress and said well
[42:53.440 --> 42:56.480]  no we never got a warning there are no memos and Congress was looking right at
[42:56.480 --> 43:00.520]  her knowing with copies of the memos that were classified going really you
[43:00.520 --> 43:06.000]  don't have any of those do you six of the ten commissioners are on record
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.800]  saying inside job total cover up now I don't know specifically what happened but
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.120]  the best we can tell they put guys on the planes they thought it was part of a
[43:15.120 --> 43:21.200]  drill they gas everybody to knock them out or kill them we don't know then they
[43:21.200 --> 43:27.120]  remote control them into the buildings flight 93 was going to the Capitol on a
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.840]  direct beeline for the Capitol and Air National Guard out of South Dakota that
[43:32.840 --> 43:37.640]  was rotated through Virginia we even know the name of the top general and they
[43:37.640 --> 43:44.920]  were even awarded that that wing that group of planes awards high-level awards
[43:44.920 --> 43:49.920]  but the award ceremony was in secret and we know that it came over the FAA radio
[43:49.920 --> 43:55.160]  this was released the F-16 traffic we even know the name of the pilot and the
[43:55.160 --> 44:00.800]  general gives the order he checks it three times he goes to aim nines and
[44:00.800 --> 44:06.760]  they're like that's an order take it out they fired two sidewinder missiles into
[44:06.760 --> 44:10.200]  the jet aircraft blowing it up before you get to its target that's why the
[44:10.200 --> 44:13.160]  state police and others said there were huge explosions and an airplane blowing
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.560]  up in the sky its debris was over nine miles and they have discovery in
[44:18.560 --> 44:23.600]  history channel shows debunking it with total fraud
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.280]  so thank God they blew that plane up but they gave you a story you wanted to buy
[44:29.280 --> 44:34.160]  into let's roll let's take them out why didn't they roll on all the other planes
[44:34.160 --> 44:39.480]  of course planes with Americans or anybody else on board if somebody gets
[44:39.480 --> 44:41.800]  out of box cutter and starts saying I'm gonna kill you or whatever people are
[44:41.800 --> 44:47.400]  gonna fight back I mean I guarantee you somebody comes in here with a box cutter
[44:47.400 --> 44:50.920]  and says do what I say I'm gonna I'm gonna hurt them bad and it's not that
[44:50.920 --> 44:55.200]  I'm looking for trouble I'm gonna hurt them bad or die trying it's that I mean
[44:55.200 --> 45:02.440]  I'm either gonna do one or two things I'm gonna run or I'm gonna attack I know
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.320]  you can't run on a plane and I'm not saying I'd run because running is scary
[45:07.320 --> 45:12.240]  it's fun to attack I mean let's just all admit it and let's be honest about it
[45:12.240 --> 45:15.400]  if you're a man somebody pulls out a knife or a weapon on you it's like an
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.680]  excuse to go caveman and start you know going crazy but I'm gonna get to this
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.520]  Donald Trump clip well let's go to the point is the official story is a giant
[45:26.520 --> 45:33.480]  fraud it's a giant fraud and it's unraveling now and this is really good
[45:33.480 --> 45:40.040]  news let's go to the clip with Bush here it is what are you objecting to about
[45:40.040 --> 45:46.680]  mr. Trump's remarks about 9-11 and your brother look my brother responded to a
[45:46.680 --> 45:50.880]  crisis and he did it as you would hope a president would do he united the
[45:50.880 --> 45:55.040]  country he organized our country and he kept us safe and there's no denying that
[45:55.040 --> 45:58.280]  the great majority of Americans believe that and I don't know why he keeps
[45:58.280 --> 46:03.000]  bringing this up it's it doesn't show that he's a serious person as it relates
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.920]  to being commander-in-chief and being the architect of a foreign policy across
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.320]  the spectrum of foreign policy mr. Trump talks about things that as though he's
[46:12.320 --> 46:16.840]  still sounds like me literally about serious saying ISIS should take out a
[46:16.840 --> 46:20.920]  sod then Russia should take out ISIS as though it was some kind of board game
[46:20.920 --> 46:25.880]  and not a serious approach is just this is just another example of that's
[46:25.880 --> 46:29.640]  actually Trump waffling off his good policy of not attacking a sovereign
[46:29.640 --> 46:33.920]  country who's done nothing and taking out ISIS that he said a month ago he
[46:33.920 --> 46:40.400]  backed Putin now he's flip-flopped and actually gone with the policy to let
[46:40.400 --> 46:45.920]  ISIS take out a sod and then get them out and kick them over into the Islamic
[46:45.920 --> 46:50.320]  state made up of Syria part of Syria and part of Iraq that's the actual state
[46:50.320 --> 46:56.440]  Department plan so now Trump's going with the official plan and
[46:56.440 --> 47:01.360]  Jeb Bush praying on ignorant viewers spins it as if Trump hasn't actually
[47:01.360 --> 47:06.920]  sold out to a certain extent let's go ahead and go back to the bobblehead the
[47:06.920 --> 47:10.440]  lack of seriousness and this is a serious time we're under we're under
[47:10.440 --> 47:13.760]  grave threats again and I think we need a president with a steady hand let's hit
[47:13.760 --> 47:19.400]  pause again 14 years later there's hundreds of thousands of al-Qaeda people
[47:19.400 --> 47:23.320]  under a new name running around our media says don't worry we arm al-Nusra the
[47:23.320 --> 47:30.840]  not the the non-radical al-Qaeda group actually say al-Qaeda you made the
[47:30.840 --> 47:34.160]  world worse you put radical Islam in charge with your buddies in Saudi
[47:34.160 --> 47:37.480]  Arabia that you're constantly vacationing with and hugging and kissing
[47:37.480 --> 47:42.200]  it's disgusting people like Bandar Bush are called members of your family and
[47:42.200 --> 47:47.560]  then you call the Clintons your family and vacation with them you're a
[47:47.560 --> 47:50.320]  sickening piece of trash let's go back to it
[47:50.320 --> 47:54.720]  levels advocate do you think it's at all possible that your your loyalty to your
[47:54.720 --> 48:00.200]  brother while very admirable on a personal level might be in some ways a
[48:00.200 --> 48:07.920]  political or policy liability blinding you to to mistakes he made no I mean so
[48:07.920 --> 48:14.480]  next week Mr. Trump is probably gonna say that FDR was around when Japan
[48:14.480 --> 48:18.600]  attacked Pearl Harbor it's what you do after that matters and that's the sign
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.400]  of leadership wow it's not the does you does anybody actually blame my brother
[48:23.400 --> 48:26.560]  for the attacks on 9-11 if they do they're totally marginalized in our
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.760]  society it's what he did after that matter and I'm proud he says he controls
[48:30.760 --> 48:35.320]  reality you're marginalized if you don't believe the way I do your brother did
[48:35.320 --> 48:40.360]  know bare minimum your brother got to attack an innocent country and and walk
[48:40.360 --> 48:44.880]  around on aircraft carriers wearing cod pieces I mean you're a joke your family's
[48:44.880 --> 48:53.800]  a joke we're sick of you get off our backs get off our backs come back now
[48:53.800 --> 49:00.160]  let's go to Trump responding to that here it is his brother gets hit on he's a
[49:00.160 --> 49:04.840]  loyal person he's loyal to his brother but his brother made some mistakes his
[49:04.840 --> 49:08.600]  brother could have made a mistake with respect to the actual hit because they
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.480]  did know it was coming and George 10 at the head of the CIA told them that it
[49:12.480 --> 49:16.720]  was coming so they did have advanced notice and they didn't really work on it
[49:16.720 --> 49:20.680]  now that's something that could happen I don't blame him for that again the
[49:20.680 --> 49:25.520]  question was it wasn't that I was blaming they said that our country was
[49:25.520 --> 49:29.400]  safe under Bush I said well what about the World Trade Center coming down in
[49:29.400 --> 49:34.200]  the worst attack in history but the statement was our country was safe under
[49:34.200 --> 49:39.200]  his brother yeah and I said well okay but you got to add in you know if you go
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.560]  back a few days you have to add in a thing called the World Trade Center and
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.720]  they wouldn't do that so you know so I disagreed with that statement that's
[49:48.720 --> 49:51.600]  right they're saying Trump wouldn't be a good military leader and that the Bush
[49:51.600 --> 49:56.080]  is know how to keep us safe keep us safe by taking all of our liberties and our
[49:56.080 --> 50:01.040]  freedoms claiming homeland securities for radical Islamist and open borders and
[50:01.040 --> 50:05.240]  then you get rid of our borders bring in record numbers of Islamists and then
[50:05.240 --> 50:10.560]  lecture us all day about how the number one terror threat is patriots the Bushes
[50:10.560 --> 50:16.040]  are basically Democrats masquerading as Republicans and everybody knows that
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.440]  he's got half a brain and is sick and tired of it but to also then say that in
[50:21.440 --> 50:25.400]  leadership you don't get blamed for letting something happen you it's how
[50:25.400 --> 50:30.080]  you respond so if you just open up the levers of a big dam in Colorado and flood
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.600]  50,000 people and kill a bunch of them it's okay as long as you send rescue
[50:34.600 --> 50:43.880]  helicopters no no no no no there was a stand down of NORAD you stood to gain
[50:43.880 --> 50:49.520]  defense contractors made trillions off the wars that came out of 9-11 and we
[50:49.520 --> 50:53.720]  know it was an inside job the extent to which we don't know the details but we
[50:53.720 --> 50:59.520]  know the official story is as phony as Hillary Clinton we'll be back a sudden
[50:59.520 --> 51:05.040]  change in the wind the day grows dark as ominous clouds move in and lightning
[51:05.040 --> 51:12.360]  begins to carve arcs in the sky if you realize you are not prepared tornadoes

[1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:36.360]  major geopolitical developments and to take your phone calls Justin Trudeau the
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:40.000]  son of the former prime minister although we live in a society where we've
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:43.520]  brought back royalty has been elected Justin Trudeau the leader of the
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:48.000]  Liberal Party will become Canada's second youngest prime minister and the
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:56.360]  first to follow a parent in the office born in 1971 to the Trudeau family
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:02.680]  Canada's prime minister at the time and and it goes on from that point all I know
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:07.320]  is they are going to come after your guns like they did last time the problem
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:12.480]  is the outgoing prime minister has been a total globalist and signed Canada on
[1:01:12.480 --> 1:01:16.000]  the TPP and a lot of that was the backlash is what got Trudeau in I
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:20.240]  wonder if he'll continue to try to get him out of the TPP notice they said they
[1:01:20.240 --> 1:01:25.800]  had to get the TPP signed two weeks ago in secret because Canada was about to
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:29.000]  have an election and might not be part of it and so they needed to get it done
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:32.840]  before the new prime minister came in well he's got the power to try to pull
[1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:40.760]  them out of it and to make it public let's hold our breath and see if that
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:50.440]  actually happens Canada's liberal leader Trudeau not just another pretty face
[1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:56.520]  he's a young and handsome outdoorsman and former bartender among other roles far
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:00.880]  removed from politics proved Monday he's not just another pretty face the son of
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.360]  the late and beloved Premier he led Canada's opposition Liberal Party to a
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:11.120]  landslide in Canada's general election the former French teacher age 43 overcame
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:17.520]  campaign attack ads claiming he was just not ready to lead Canada so it's just
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:21.960]  another stunt you know it'll be all black president oh a pretty boy president
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:26.240]  oh a woman president I don't care what color you are how old you are just don't
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:30.280]  come after people's guns just don't push more welfare state just don't push more
[1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:36.960]  I'm so sick of these people mmm and I'm so sick of how we can't ever have good
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:41.280]  conservative responses to this we've got to have these controlled opposition
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:50.600]  people like Cameron and Harper and Boehner and all the rest of it and you
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:57.120]  know they want more neo-con Rhino types be the new speaker that fight is
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:04.800]  certainly heating up in a big way some of the topics that we're going to be
[1:03:04.800 --> 1:03:07.360]  covering
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:15.480]  China's selling tons of US debt but Americans could care less Bloomberg
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:21.560]  global trade is collapsing as the worldwide economic recession deepens
[1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:32.600]  ex-US agent it's over six years for Bitcoin theft in silk road probe we're
[1:03:32.600 --> 1:03:36.240]  going to get into Ted Cruz says he cannot overstate the threats to internet
[1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:43.080]  freedom independent news websites like drudge Obamacare penalty now kicks in
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:46.720]  that's associated press I know they told you it didn't exist like the death
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:51.440]  panels it you could read the bill always existed that's another thing it's
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:58.080]  hard to believe they lie so nakedly to their moron constituents and then
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:02.800]  they're moron constituents a lot of them don't even remember a year or two
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:10.640]  later when they get hit with the lie in their pocketbook but nevertheless that's
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:15.800]  going on and then also we're gonna get into Star Wars you know Star Wars is
[1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:20.280]  cheesy and really the only good ones as an adult to watch it would be maybe
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:25.520]  episode four episode five episode three is pretty good for its plot false flags
[1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:30.720]  bringing in tyranny but now you know there's copies of the script floating
[1:04:30.720 --> 1:04:38.480]  around for the new force awakens and world that daily asks is it anti-white
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:44.040]  now I don't think it's anti-white because you've got a star studded cast of
[1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:47.400]  different people with different colors but it certainly pushes the unified
[1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:51.560]  agenda of feminism where on the movie posters it's the you know that the
[1:04:51.560 --> 1:04:56.520]  heroes a woman which would be fine if it wasn't every movie now the heroes and
[1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:04.480]  bosses are all women the 21 gun salute a time-honored tradition that has been
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:10.080]  celebrating veterans for years is now banned by an Iowa high school according
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:14.560]  to an NBC affiliate administrators at Bell Plain High School say that the
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:19.480]  salute quote promotes gun violence in quote but common sense hasn't completely
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.680]  left the area a member of the American Legion a veterans organization
[1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:27.600]  offered up property near the school so the assembly could continue but the
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:31.640]  group is disappointed over the school's decision and fear it could reverberate
[1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:35.800]  to other parts of the state similar efforts to demonize firearms have
[1:05:35.800 --> 1:05:40.080]  already popped up in other schools across the country in other schools across
[1:05:40.080 --> 1:05:44.760]  the nation anti-gun hysteria has manifested in students being suspended
[1:05:44.760 --> 1:05:49.840]  or expelled for playing with toy guns fighting pastries into gun shapes and

[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:26.760]  could care less that's a Bloomberg headline not an info wars headline
[1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:32.080]  global trade is collapsing as the worldwide economic recession deepens
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:36.760]  and now the Federal Reserve is coming out admitting that the economy is
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:46.960]  beginning to degrade we also have the fight between Bush and Trump heating up
[1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:50.280]  with Trump pointing out that 9-11 happened on Bush's watch and that he
[1:09:50.280 --> 1:09:54.240]  knew it was coming which was admitted at the time just type in Bush knew you'll
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:57.960]  get Associated Press New York Post you name it from the time they lied about
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:05.240]  those memos they lied about the CIA warnings we're also going to get
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:09.040]  obviously into the latest on what's happening in the Middle East with the
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:16.400]  Russian air bombardment backed up by Revolutionary Guard out of Iran Hezbollah
[1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:21.440]  out of surrounding areas as well and Cuban forces and I can't stand Cuban
[1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:27.880]  forces that fought against US forces and others obviously in Africa but at the
[1:10:27.880 --> 1:10:31.960]  same time this is an old coalition and it's fighting an offensive force of
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:39.040]  al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia and the West so it is just now the Russians stay there
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:43.520]  or the Russians start expanding then it's a tyranny so I don't I don't
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:48.640]  romanticize any of this but I would imagine Joel Scalzen will probably as
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:53.880]  an expert on this want to start first with a situation in the Middle East in
[1:10:53.880 --> 1:11:00.280]  Syria and then we will expand out from there into the larger geopolitical
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:06.640]  issues and what he sees happening in election 2016 we also have the Paul's
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:13.840]  last week and this week ran Paul the senator but Ron Paul drug into a court
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:18.440]  hearings felony hearings that a judge dismissed the main felonies but they're
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.600]  still going after Jesse Benton Ron Paul's former chief of staff for quote
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:26.960]  lying to the FBI well they can claim that you made a mistake or claim you got
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.280]  one thing wrong and then that's lying so you cannot talk in my opinion to the
[1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:33.760]  FBI even if you want to tell them something truthfully that happened
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:39.680]  because if they're corrupt you don't know which agents you're dealing with then
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:42.320]  they'll just say you lied to them if you get anything wrong and that's what they
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:48.560]  convict most people for and so they're clearly going after the polls now if you
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:52.760]  look at it it's for supposedly getting an endorsement from a candidate they're
[1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:55.480]  going after a lot of other people there's this reign of terror on free speech
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:00.320]  Ted Cruz says he cannot overstate the threats to internet freedom independent
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:07.800]  news websites like drudge we of course have had a Supreme Court justice and I've
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:11.960]  been told who yet dinner with Matt drudge telling him no we've been told
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:15.040]  they're going after free speech the next year or two and the internet freedom
[1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:19.480]  will be shut down for libertarians and conservatives so what I'm getting at here
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:26.800]  is the New World Order is moving now is that because are they moving fast because
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:30.720]  they're behind or are they moving fast because they're arrogant I think it's a
[1:12:30.720 --> 1:12:35.040]  mix of both but Joel Scowles and joins us Joe I've thrown a lot of issues out
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:39.440]  there in the last four minutes you join us via video Skype but what do you want
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:45.600]  to tackle first Syria yes let's talk about Syria because it still is the
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:50.520]  major force that the globalists are dealing with it's the major defeat that
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:54.000]  they're going that they're probably not going to be able to overcome I think
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.200]  they'll be able to overcome Trump they'll be able to overcome the resistance to
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.280]  internet freedom and all the other things that they do in the name of
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:05.000]  securing our liberties but they're not going to be able to stop the Russians I
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:11.040]  don't believe in in Syria and right now from what the new sources I've got in
[1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:16.480]  the Middle East this it's mostly Hezbollah in terms of the ground troops
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:22.080]  not the Cubans and not the Iranians there are those there but I would say
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:28.720]  almost 75% of the ground troops that Syria is using in the town towards Aleppo
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:35.680]  which is the largest city and was the largest city in Syria and under al-Qaeda
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:41.360]  control or the US-backed rebels the Russians and Hezbollah have captured
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:46.600]  all of the surrounding towns in the province of Aleppo and so they're
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.640]  gearing up and Iranians are coming in they're gearing up for a major battle to
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:55.800]  take Aleppo this is going to be a game changer in Syria because it's first of
[1:13:55.800 --> 1:14:00.760]  all extremely embarrassing to the US I've been fighting ISIS supposedly for a
[1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:03.280]  year and I've never been able to do anything like the Russians have done in
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:10.800]  three weeks and it's also a real stick in the eye for the globalist to have a
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:14.760]  major agenda and taking down Syria it's not going to happen now Assad is
[1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.880]  probably going to survive though you know the Russians may in accommodation with
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:25.720]  the world decision that you know Assad has to go they may allow some other type
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:32.200]  of election but it's not going to be a yehadist takeover of Syria which would
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:37.880]  have been involved you know basically a bloodbath it would Libya all over again
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:42.840]  and I don't think Russia is going to allow that the globalist cannot stop it
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:51.240]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was on the show last week and he thinks they'll up their
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:56.200]  assassination attempts on Putin and that goes with the past history do you think
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:00.000]  the New World Order would be bold enough would the Anglo-Americans be bold
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:06.520]  enough to try to assassinate Putin I do not Alex and the reason is the globalist
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:11.880]  want a strong Russia that's why they've continued to you know violate their own
[1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:16.280]  sanctions deal in Russian oil and Russian rocket motors and things which we
[1:15:16.280 --> 1:15:21.800]  depend upon the sanctions or token sanctions they want a strong Russia
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:25.280]  they want a strong Putin who will rejuvenate the feeling of the old
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:29.280]  Soviet Union among the Russian people they want this war this third world war
[1:15:29.280 --> 1:15:34.840]  and so you know that's my one criticism of Paul Craig Roberts as good as he has
[1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:40.200]  been over the past decades he's now he really doesn't understand the nature of
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:45.760]  the conspiracy we're dealing with he views Putin as a champion and he is
[1:15:45.760 --> 1:15:51.200]  doing the right thing in Syria in taking down the globalist agenda but still the
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.560]  the Soviet Union was a falsified phony collapse it's being rejuvenated it's
[1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:01.560]  going after Ukraine and eventually they'll go after the Baltic states it's
[1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:05.920]  going to attack the westerns preparing to attack them so these are not the good
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.680]  guys and neither are the Chinese and so I think we have to look at this
[1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:14.760]  realistically as you mentioned in your introduction I think we have to applaud
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:20.600]  the fact that Russia is stopping the globalist agenda in Syria and that will
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:24.960]  affect the the Iranian agenda as well because Syria remember was to be taken
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:28.560]  down at the request of the Israelis before the Israelis would attack Iran
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:34.000]  and that's why the US conjured up this Iran the Iranian nuclear deal simply to
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.840]  put the war on Iran on hold while they take down Syria and now Russia has just
[1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:45.280]  blocked that full force with their intervention and so either the globalist
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:53.080]  have to create a separate war between Israel against Syria or Saudi Arabia
[1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:57.440]  against Syria using the excuse that Iran Iranian troops are in Syria and that's
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:04.800]  a possibility what about Israel couldn't Israel be a wildcard Israeli knows
[1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:08.800]  been doing some flights in and around Syria what about Turkey shooting down
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:18.000]  a Russian drone could we see something spark off a larger conflict we could but
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:23.480]  so far we don't see any of that the Russians have denied that the drone was
[1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:27.680]  theirs and that leaves a very interesting question did the Turk Turk shoot
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:34.200]  down a US drone or or could have been perhaps an Iranian drone but the and the
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:37.000]  Russians may not be telling the truth they may not want the embarrassment I
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:41.440]  don't think anybody wants to tackle Russian jets for example the Russian
[1:17:41.440 --> 1:17:46.680]  jets confronted this week to Israeli fighters that were going through Lebanon
[1:17:46.680 --> 1:17:52.240]  and basically said you know halt turn around and they did so even the Israelis
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:55.240]  as good as their fighter pilots are probably the best in the world are
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:18:01.880]  reluctant to tangle with the Russians so as I say I don't think we're sure
[1:18:01.880 --> 1:18:09.200]  that's because they've been given orders not to that's right you know I I don't
[1:18:09.200 --> 1:18:15.160]  see a direct confrontation with NATO versus Russia because NATO in the
[1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:18.800]  United States don't want to provoke a war with Russia this isn't the time for
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:24.440]  World War three Russian China aren't ready yet but still they've got to
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:30.200]  overcome this Syrian situation somehow and they may have to wait till Russia
[1:18:30.200 --> 1:18:35.800]  runs its course takes back a majority of Syria for Assad and if there are
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:42.120]  sufficient Iranian troops in there the Saudis or the the Israelis could use
[1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:47.680]  that in an excuse to intervene Saudi Arabia has been making a lot of
[1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:52.080]  threats against Assad and against Russia but at the same time meeting with the
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:56.520]  Russian envoys but the United States has been refusing to meet with the Russian
[1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:59.560]  foreign minister that's even unprecedented during the Cuban Missile
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:04.000]  Crisis to refuse to meet with the Russian foreign minister well there's a
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:10.760]  very good reason for that Alex and that is that the the United States simply you
[1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:15.840]  know has to be careful Russian knows that the US created ISIS and so when the
[1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:20.240]  Russians going to press the US about the fact that they're not sharing any
[1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:23.680]  target information with them they don't want Russian information they don't want
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:29.040]  to tell them what targets not to hit I mean that's a tacit admission that we
[1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:33.360]  don't want Russia to engage with us directly over ISIS because it will
[1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:39.040]  expose the fact that we don't want ISIS taken down now on the other hand Russia
[1:19:39.040 --> 1:19:47.280]  has been working fairly smoothly with both Israel and Saudi Arabia and how
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:52.240]  should I put this you know Israel is completely in the globalist pocket stay

[1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:33.720]  800-259-9231 800-259-9231 now I don't think Hillary Clinton's gonna
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:41.200]  actually try to confiscate our guns starting in 2016 if she gets elected I
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:47.080]  don't think you'll try to confiscate them up front but with registration and
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.480]  with banning the gun show loophole and with banning the transfer of firearms
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:56.680]  and with restricting semi-autos they will begin the process towards
[1:24:56.680 --> 1:25:00.760]  criminalization of gun ownership but I've got to ask Joel Scows in the
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:07.120]  question why would Hillary Obama Democrats on CNN MSNBC coming up the
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:09.760]  third hour after he's gone we have a big compilation of this we're gonna be
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:17.320]  playing come out and say no we are going to do Australian style gun buy back and
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:23.120]  take all semi-autos which they call automatic why would they be signaling
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:27.000]  such a strong intention when in the past they would admit it in their
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:31.160]  literature and in their fundraising and and they've done this in the cities they
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.000]  control and the country's globalist control but why would they be so honest
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:43.400]  and say yes we're gonna try to move for Australian style plans I mean that will
[1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:51.160]  cause what I would call a civil war in many areas I mean I a why do you think
[1:25:51.160 --> 1:25:55.520]  you're doing this B do you disagree that an attempt to ban most firearms will
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:26:02.560]  explode well I think that frankly this is a political move to help sabotage
[1:26:02.560 --> 1:26:08.520]  Hillary's bid for the presidency the Democrats have long learned that you
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:12.920]  can't vote for gun control and even get reelected in a democratic area except
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:18.600]  for very few areas anyway so there's no reason politically to bring this out
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:23.760]  Hillary has evaded the issue of gun control of before in the campaign to
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.200]  come out they you know I'm not in favor of the second minute I'm in favor of
[1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:30.760]  repealing the second amendment that's a death knell to Hillary Clinton so I
[1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:36.560]  think this is sabotage from her advisors of her campaign I agree I mean I'm no
[1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:41.360]  super political analyst but this is this is two plus two equals four this is
[1:26:41.360 --> 1:26:47.600]  suicide behavior politically it is I mean clearly you can't even pass a gun
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:51.480]  control treaty in the UN they're gonna have to bypass that in some way I
[1:26:51.480 --> 1:26:55.960]  agree with you completely they're gonna be working on nibbling around the edges
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:00.840]  getting registration registration always leads to confiscation eventually a gun
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:08.160]  buyback is a is a nice looking way you know to confiscate or precedes that but
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:12.720]  they're not gonna be able to take this fast at all well I agree with you it's
[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:16.960]  not mental illness and then being delusional it's it's bad advice and
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:22.800]  they're not stupid so I guess she's stupid then she's pretty smart why would
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.400]  she continue she's made like four of these statements the last two weeks why
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.200]  would she come out and and talk about repealing the second amendment and
[1:27:30.200 --> 1:27:36.320]  stuff I mean well she knows that plays well to the hardcore left which you
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.120]  know Bernie Sanders has played to the hardcore left and she's trying to get
[1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:44.280]  those votes back so I can see how she could easily be induced by her advice
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:49.160]  to say yeah this would be good for you know degrading Bernie Sanders appeal by
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.880]  appealing to gun control I don't think she realizes that her campaign is being
[1:27:53.880 --> 1:27:58.560]  sabotaged I mean clearly you've got to remember that the Democrats surrounding
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:05.240]  Hillary really believe that the powers to be are pro-democratic party and we're
[1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:09.520]  gonna let them win but the guys really under the scenes that are calling the
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:12.640]  shots don't want Hillary and I think they're setting up for a loss and this
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:17.480]  is part of that I agree with you do you think they're readying Biden for a
[1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:23.040]  serious run or do they want to make a change and put a Republican in well they
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:29.480]  want to put a Republican in and I I personally got feeling is that Biden
[1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:34.000]  isn't gonna run and one of the reasons that I say that is because they the
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:38.480]  media has put a big push on to say that Hillary Clinton has been boosted in the
[1:28:38.480 --> 1:28:44.280]  polls some 10% because of the debate now the debates history already and that
[1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:47.480]  boost would have showed up immediately after the debate now that they're
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.160]  boosting it it's kind of as an indication let's make Hillary unbeatable so
[1:28:52.160 --> 1:28:57.480]  that Biden will kind of go away in that regard that's my gut feeling I don't
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:29:01.160]  think Biden's gonna challenge Hillary because the globalists want to move
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:04.920]  their agenda forward they don't want a another Democrat and I mean they would
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:09.480]  be dead in the water yeah the Republicans are capable now moving this war
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:14.120]  agenda remember the next eight years we're gonna see this World War three and
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:18.560]  I think they want a Republican in office as they had George W. Bush during the
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:24.240]  9-11 catastrophe because he can convince conservatives to go along you
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:28.920]  have tech crews following a neocon script I mean it's just embarrassing how
[1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:34.280]  badly he's bought into the Syrian agenda and the same with Donald Trump you know
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:38.640]  he he has a little bit of light on the subject having revealed that you know
[1:29:38.640 --> 1:29:43.680]  Bush administration knew that an attack was coming on the World Senate not only
[1:29:43.680 --> 1:29:46.400]  did they know of course it was a government operation from beginning
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:49.600]  let's talk about that we come back Joel Scowles of World Affairs British the
[1:29:49.600 --> 1:30:00.440]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a US high school student
[1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:05.040]  has reportedly hacked the personal AOL account of CIA director John Brennan
[1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:10.080]  according to the hacker everything from a 47 page application for top secret
[1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:14.360]  security clearance to details of the agency's harsh interrogation techniques
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:19.280]  were discovered in the breach notes the New York Post the October 12th intrusion
[1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:23.760]  began after the hacker was able to trick workers at Verizon into providing
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:28.800]  Brennan's personal information and duping AOL into resetting his password law
[1:30:28.800 --> 1:30:32.720]  enforcement sources speaking with the post were shocked at the hackers actions
[1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:37.040]  noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example of the hackers if
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:41.240]  possible we've previously seen the CIA brag about how they're collecting your
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.480]  information going as far as saying they could spy on you through your

[1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:33.380]  officer in the Marine Corps fighter pilot bomber vietnam best-selling
[1:33:33.380 --> 1:33:38.960]  author of course was his famous uncle clion scousen the naked communist and
[1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:43.720]  then other books exposing how the ultra rich actually fun communism and
[1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:48.080]  socialism to domesticate the public and he writes for world affairs brief one
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:54.520]  of the most accurate in-depth publications out there that really goes
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:58.560]  into the hard research to understand what's happening and of course you'll
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:03.080]  scousen also understands this is a spiritual conflict I've always been a
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:07.840]  Christian brought up a Christian I've had a relationship with Christ and so is
[1:34:07.840 --> 1:34:14.800]  you know young man but at the same time I never really doubted God but the more
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.440]  research I did and the more I studied the New World Order and the more I dug
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:25.000]  into it these people are into the occult they believe in God the devil they
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  believe the devil's God and they really follow it and they're really getting
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:37.480]  power from it and the atheist out there that's that whole system that's pushed
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:42.600]  by the establishment some of them are true believers that there isn't a God
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:47.720]  there's nothing outside of the five senses but the higher levels I found
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:52.680]  they're actually occultic servants of this system and they don't want the
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:59.040]  public even knowing there is a spiritual realm taking place but look at us
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:04.120]  we're on a planet on the edge of a galaxy there's hundreds of billions of
[1:35:04.120 --> 1:35:09.000]  galaxies that have been photographed there's all these teeming you know
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:15.080]  billions of planets hundreds of millions sometimes per galaxy all these
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:20.160]  dimensions they've discovered and then they just sit around saying there's
[1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:23.880]  nothing going on there's nothing happening just just just watch television
[1:35:23.880 --> 1:35:29.280]  watch dancing with the stars go back to sleep everything's fine this is all an
[1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:35.080]  attempt to keep people from awakening it's an attempt to destroy your free will

[1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:36.160]  track record our guests have a great track record we're promoting freedom and
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:41.400]  when you shop with us you make the globalist very upset because you're
[1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:45.680]  voting with your dollars you're voting with your euros you're voting with your
[1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:51.680]  yen you're young you are funding the growth of movements that are anti-new
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:55.520]  world order and as the globalists get more arrogant and more aggressive and
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:59.560]  as things get worse those of us that have set ourselves up in opposition
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:05.680]  against them are only going to get stronger because people realize this is
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:11.880]  real now but in that paradox they're coming after us and that's why there's
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:17.520]  all these admissions all over the world they're going after free speech arresting
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:22.000]  Germans that try to rally against open borders you know banning American flags
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:28.240]  and schools charging 15 Alabama's or no Georgians is also having Alabama with
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:34.720]  terrorism for having rebel flags out of the park I mean they're charged saying
[1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:39.200]  the flag is an act of terror this can be projected on to any speech now so I'm
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:44.560]  all over the map here with our guest from World Affairs Brief the editor in
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:50.440]  chief over there Joel Scalzen finish up with 9-11 if you would with your view I
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:53.200]  know it's hard to know exactly what happened but the official story we know
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:57.920]  is a fraud and then finishing up with where Ted Cruz is going versus some of
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.280]  the other candidates and then I want to go to phone calls Joel Scalzen well
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:07.600]  Alex as I have been very open in my website in my newsletter I believe that
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:12.360]  9-11 was a government operation from beginning again it's not just they let
[1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:17.480]  it happen you can't explain all of the complexity of 9-11 unless it was a
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:21.400]  government operation from the loading of explosives into the building to the
[1:40:21.400 --> 1:40:27.560]  loading explosives into the airplane that hit the the Pentagon which blew it to
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:32.160]  confetti-sized pieces a bomb in the cargo bay doesn't do that it has to be
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:37.600]  loaded and wings tails every portion of it to the switching of aircraft the
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:42.120]  radar tape show that the 9-11 hijacked aircraft switched with other aircraft
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:47.480]  coming from the west coast over the Midwest and that those airplanes went
[1:40:47.480 --> 1:40:53.880]  elsewhere I mean hijackers couldn't do that as well as the modification of the
[1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:59.840]  aircraft that actually hit the pen on the cover-up you know all of the
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:04.800]  government suppression of information the cover-up of the testimony of Manetta
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:10.040]  in the White House situation where Dick Cheney basically said you know you got
[1:41:10.040 --> 1:41:15.000]  to let that aircraft hit the hit the Pentagon I mean the Trump doesn't even
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.040]  have half the story about the evils of the Bush administration of course I
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:24.040]  don't think that George W. Bush was running the show any more than Barack
[1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:28.320]  Obama was running the show right now but he certainly was knowledgeable I mean
[1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:31.920]  he wasn't even surprised when he was told that the towers were hit just nodded
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:40.120]  his head and went on with his elementary school reading session and then of
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:46.520]  course they were taken to off at Air Force Base in Omaha for safekeeping
[1:41:46.520 --> 1:41:51.040]  there's just too much involved with 9-11 including the suppression of the
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:56.240]  air traffic control the the fighter support the falsification of the the
[1:41:56.240 --> 1:42:00.760]  crash site of Flight 93 what actually landed at Cleveland Airport and was put
[1:42:00.760 --> 1:42:05.320]  in the Nassau hangar I mean everything was falsified which the terrorists
[1:42:05.320 --> 1:42:11.120]  couldn't have done the let's roll phony tape recordings of cell phone
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.160]  conversation cell phones don't work at 10,000 feet and above they're
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:19.720]  horizontally oriented antennas they simply don't work vertically and I've
[1:42:19.720 --> 1:42:24.400]  proven that flying my own aircraft they'll work a low altitude you know
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:29.680]  2,000 3,000 4,000 feet but that's it they always cut out by 7,000 feet I've
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:34.560]  done it almost every time I fly hoping one day it works above that to prove the
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:40.000]  official story because I don't want to believe the government did it but they
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.320]  did do it and you know I've got to appreciate Trump for at least
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:48.320]  tainting the reputation of George W. Bush saying he didn't keep us safe
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:54.320]  because he didn't and so it's very important but you know getting to the
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:43:00.040]  larger overall picture here remember the Trump's numbers despite the attack I
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:03.080]  mean when you look at the pictures just like what's showing on the screen now
[1:43:03.080 --> 1:43:07.560]  every time they put a picture up of Trump it is the most odd pose making him
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:13.800]  look weird there's never a favorable pose that the media puts up of Trump that
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:16.960]  shows they're still trying to destroy him but his poll numbers keep going up
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:23.280]  they say they're up to 28% now I think they're above 30% Ben Carson of course
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:29.440]  is in second Ted Cruz is in third and Jeff Bush has cleared down a 5% now in
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:34.840]  sixth place I'm not sure even with the primary system that they manipulated and
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:39.400]  loaded so that they can change things midstream I'm not sure they can resurrect
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:45.040]  George Bush or Jeff Bush is so low sure but they keep foisting him they keep
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:50.280]  force-feeding him and they'll show him at like a fair in front at the back of a
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:54.160]  crowd that isn't even there for him to make it look like it's a crowd for him
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:58.200]  then when they show Trump they'll show a close shot without the crowd I mean they
[1:43:58.200 --> 1:44:05.440]  are pulling out the stops as I say the conservatives I mean I think that they
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:09.860]  could run Bush and get him to win in a general election but the problem is
[1:44:09.860 --> 1:44:14.640]  getting over the Tea Party conservatives that are running this Republican
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:19.600]  nomination problem there's a major rebellion in full force against the
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:23.620]  Republican establishment as demonstrated by the resignation of John
[1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:27.680]  Boehner and then Kevin McCarthy to follow him they can't even hard to get
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:35.040]  anyone to run because the conservatives know sure the establishment goes for
[1:44:35.040 --> 1:44:40.080]  someone they're controlled and if Ryan accepts they've got controls on Ryan
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:45.200]  but they've got to somehow take Trump down and I think the fact that they've
[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:49.640]  got Rubio boosted in the polls and I don't know how this comes up unless
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:57.120]  there's some phony polling going on here Rubio's in in third place now and you
[1:44:57.120 --> 1:45:02.840]  know but Ben Carson has read Cleon Skousen's book my uncle he's talked
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:09.320]  about them online you know plant within the establishment doesn't do that so I
[1:45:09.320 --> 1:45:13.960]  think Ben Carson is legit and I think he's looking and that's why Trump and
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:17.480]  Carson don't criticize you I think Carson's looking for a vice president's
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:22.560]  slot under Trump but I can't imagine the establishment allowing Trump to win but
[1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:26.920]  if he should win like Ronald Reagan won the nomination in opposition to
[1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:31.280]  everything they try to do to stop him they did learn to control Ronald Reagan
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:35.360]  even throwing an assassination attempt at him and I can guarantee you if they
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:40.400]  can control Ronald Reagan who is a true ideological conservative they can
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:45.360]  control Donald Trump who isn't an ideological absolutely but I don't think
[1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:49.280]  Trump consciously is a globalist and wants to destroy America he wants
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:53.560]  prosperity he's not for clowered and piven and I think that's why they hate
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:59.440]  him so much and I think he is obviously going to be attacked more I agree with
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:05.680]  you they might try to kill him if he gets into office but if you look at what
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:10.480]  the Democratic Party is doing themselves they are running like they know that
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:15.160]  their time is up I mean look at the debate numbers look at how CNN cut the
[1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:20.440]  time I agree with you that they're looking to put a Republican in yeah they
[1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:25.760]  can control the backlash in America against Obama and the Democrats by putting
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:30.680]  a Republican they just there's going to be rebellion in the ranks if they put a
[1:46:30.680 --> 1:46:36.440]  Democrat in and so I think that's where we're going Alex and but as I say this
[1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:41.000]  is a major I think there's four major setbacks of globalist to face it's the
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:45.600]  Russians in Syria which they did not expect if Russia was going to go in they
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:51.360]  expected to go in a lot earlier the backlash against the immigration wave
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:56.560]  is a major setback for the globalist although I will say that even in Sweden
[1:46:56.560 --> 1:47:00.360]  which is on the verge of bankruptcy in many of the smaller communities because
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:04.160]  of their welfare state system they can't even handle their own citizens because
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:11.120]  of the migrant pull on the economy they still are not reversing anything Sweden
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.280]  is get not given any hint whatsoever that they're going to stop this insane
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.960]  immigration absolutely the plan is break these countries up bring in a client
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:24.760]  force why would the socialist why would the globalist why would the Peter
[1:47:24.760 --> 1:47:29.840]  Sutherland's openly say to the BBC as he did no we want to get rid of European
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:34.480]  culture we want to break it with these migrants I mean Sutherland admits this
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:40.040]  is world government well I think it has to do also with the satanic nature of
[1:47:40.040 --> 1:47:45.280]  this conspiracy I mean clearly this you can't no single person any mafia evil
[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:52.000]  wealthy powerful person couldn't get this globalist agenda started two or three
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:57.320]  centuries ago and directed and keep it going past 20 or 30 years it has to be
[1:47:57.320 --> 1:48:03.400]  a revelatory guided conspiracy and I think there's something a dimension
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:07.360]  beyond global government in terms of destruction of culture destruction of
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:12.280]  Christianity destruction of religion and the creation of a worldly secular
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.480]  society where there's conflict and hatred I mean conflict of course allows
[1:48:16.480 --> 1:48:21.480]  for the police state to continue to suppress free street free speech as the
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:26.840]  anti-migrant terminology and the rhetoric increases you're gonna find you
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:30.320]  know we the governments are gonna have to say we have to stop allowing people to
[1:48:30.320 --> 1:48:35.880]  to criticize migrants they're already doing it yes and that's going to I mean
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:42.440]  you're not even allowed to report government statistics on rate now of
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:47.040]  immigrants in Germany that's the suppression of free speech that we're
[1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:53.440]  we're warning about it is a destructive agenda I mean that's when you know you're
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:59.280]  face-to-face with evil when they're rehiring Stasi people to work at Facebook
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:06.360]  to then take Germans children away if they speak out against open borders I
[1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:10.720]  mean this is such a brazen tyranny I want to go to phone calls in the next
[1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:14.280]  segment the segment after that than Jules Calvin leaves us at five after we'll go
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:18.200]  to Harvey Ed Shane Carol Tom and others we're going to break I'll just tell you
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:22.960]  a story I know used to head up some of the biggest national conservative you
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:27.160]  know coalitions out there trying to take the Republicans back over it's got to be
[1:49:27.160 --> 1:49:31.000]  positive now to see the Tea Party at least partially not being taken over
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.440]  giving Boehner a run for his money he's having to leave but when I've talked to
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  different congressmen off air some of which don't come on the show for reasons
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:44.160]  that are obvious we don't even push to get them on but some do come on it's
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:48.600]  like being with people in a bunker or a foxhole they're just point blank we're
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:51.720]  doing our best these people are criminals these globalists are dead on
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:56.000]  we've got a chance but I tell you you know they may come after all of us I mean
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.680]  now when you talk to grown men that are 65 70 years old and then it's like you're
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.880]  in a military operation with them it's good to know finally we've got people
[1:50:04.880 --> 1:50:10.280]  in Congress that really get how big the chips are how big this is and understand
[1:50:10.280 --> 1:50:14.480]  we're fighting a purely criminal conspiracy indeed we are we've got
[1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:18.840]  people like Walter Jones who had the guts to say you know to Kevin McCarthy and
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:22.360]  everybody else if you've got skeletons in your closet you better not run for
[1:50:22.360 --> 1:50:27.080]  speaker we don't need another scandal on the Republican Party and next day
[1:50:27.080 --> 1:50:30.520]  Kevin McCarthy you know backs down because he was having an affair with
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:35.320]  the woman Republican from North Carolina according to my sources in
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:41.680]  Washington well the globalists know now though that evil's gotten so naked that
[1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:47.560]  the response of good to rise up to it is now happening it's going to be
[1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:51.220]  spectacular is it not Joel what we're gonna see in the next decade I mean won't
[1:50:51.220 --> 1:50:57.080]  we see history you know legend prophecy everything is this not an epic time to be
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:03.560]  alive right now it is Alex I'm not optimistic though you know the global
[1:51:03.560 --> 1:51:07.600]  under fire and these four basic areas where they've had setbacks but these
[1:51:07.600 --> 1:51:10.840]  people won't take no for an answer they have tremendous power they have some
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:16.920]  satanic power behind them and at the same time what it's doing it's causing this
[1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:21.360]  great division within society our movement is building and getting stronger
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:26.360]  but at the same time they're corrupting even greater numbers of people within
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:30.960]  the nation from immorality to homosexuality and other things that are
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:35.520]  taking hold within the nation so I'm not optimistic that we're going to win back
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:39.880]  freedom as a nation I believe that only in pockets of liberty are we going to
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:44.120]  be able at the local level be able to survive what's coming and I of course
[1:51:44.120 --> 1:51:47.520]  people have to survive this war that the globalists are preparing to bring down
[1:51:47.520 --> 1:51:53.680]  upon us to it's just like Helmut Kohl said in 1997 when they were arguing and
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:57.280]  bickering about the Maastricht Treaty and he said look if you don't get it
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:02.240]  together and accept this EU you're gonna have war in Europe everybody looked at
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:05.800]  one another and said what does he mean there's no sentiment for war in Europe
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:10.200]  but Helmut Kohl as a globalist was meaning he couldn't say it but he
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:14.680]  meaning if you don't abide by this stuff voluntarily we're gonna give you a war
[1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:18.640]  which will drive you into this new world order and I think that's what we're
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:22.800]  trying that was the German Chancellor at the time and now they have German
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:27.040]  governors on video saying when Germans are like we're a town of 3,000 you just
[1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:30.760]  brought 3,000 migrants in here they're telling us what to do how to live and
[1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:35.640]  they and they goes get out then I mean it's this answer of we're doing this
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:41.800]  we're going to break you it is just so naked look at this headline school
[1:52:41.800 --> 1:52:48.680]  suspends student elections because no because not enough minorities won
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:53.640]  principles suggest the candidates race trumps all other factors in an election
[1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:59.520]  that's info wars.com Sweden on verge of collapse as illegal immigrants surge
[1:52:59.520 --> 1:53:04.840]  into the country migrants shut down the tunnel under the English Channel between
[1:53:04.840 --> 1:53:08.440]  England and France for the upteenth time again today
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:14.440]  German daily documents anti-migrant hate speech on Facebook AFP with with
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:18.760]  serious headlines about thank goodness they're gonna arrest people German
[1:53:18.760 --> 1:53:25.680]  anti-Islam protests swells on fears about refugee influx so it goes on and
[1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:31.080]  on and on where they invert reality and act like it's weird that people don't
[1:53:31.080 --> 1:53:35.280]  want three four five million illegals in one year who are just given everything
[1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:40.360]  free and who don't want to assimilate and who most of them are military age men
[1:53:40.360 --> 1:53:45.000]  and have what two-thirds have fake passports I mean this is insane we have
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.080]  a police state supposedly to keep us safe from radical Islam so you then
[1:53:49.080 --> 1:53:53.160]  bring in radical Islam I want to go to calls but in one minute briefly Joel
[1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:56.840]  Scalsen what's the master plan long-term in your view between the clash of
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:54:00.920]  civilizations between the West and Islam how is Islam going to be used
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:08.200]  mid-term long-term well Islam is totally incompatible with Christian and
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:12.360]  in Western civilization and it's going to be used as the major conflict
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:16.320]  creation and we're already seeing that in Europe and Denmark I was in Norway last
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:21.040]  year and I'll tell you there's ghettos there there's those ghettos there's
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:26.680]  unrest and you can imagine you start to double the number of refugees in these
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:31.040]  countries that same thing what's happening in the US is that they're
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:34.960]  targeting rural communities to put these hundred thousand Muslims it'll
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:40.040]  probably be two hundred thousand Muslims a year because it does change the
[1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:43.720]  conservative balance within rural communities it doesn't change so much
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:48.480]  in the large urban areas but boy you stick these in small communities and
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:53.320]  Idaho and Wyoming and Nebraska and Indiana and you really change the
[1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:58.280]  culture and you cause those small governments to say hey you've got to
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:55:01.680]  come to save us federal government we can't handle these influxes sure enough
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:05.560]  the federal government's in there with money with housing and control and
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:12.280]  that's this long-term attack agenda on our culture and the feds will referee
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:15.720]  the culture clash and again the Muslims I went to high school with in
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:19.920]  college with were professionals their parents were home builders engineers
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:24.720]  they were pretty nice people I liked them but the new influxes are poor they
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:28.640]  are not assimilating they're very arrogant instead of being like hey I'm
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:32.160]  in you know embarrassed and I'm here getting stuff free it's a very chest out
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.800]  face out you better watch it attitude that the left is instilling in them very
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:43.040]  very destructive and then the left loves all this when it should be totally
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:47.640]  incompatible with their whole lifestyle of we're gonna teach your five-year-olds
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:53.120]  how to have gay sex well the Muslims would chop their heads off for that but
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:57.920]  they're very angry as well and you see that in every video in Europe just the
[1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:01.920]  anger and the hatred against Western society because you don't give us enough
[1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:06.960]  fast enough and once again I want to emphasize it's shove them into your
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:11.280]  midst and then you never send them back that's one of the problems with the
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:16.200]  Russian intervention in Syria if they solved that Syria problem within a
[1:56:16.200 --> 1:56:20.600]  year and the Russians say hey you're welcome to come back the Europeans are
[1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:24.200]  gonna be in a real problem they're gonna have to have some excuse to say why
[1:56:24.200 --> 1:56:27.680]  we're not gonna send them back once peace has been established well that's the
[1:56:27.680 --> 1:56:31.680]  Peter Sutherland migrant plant that you in he said he writes essay saying it we
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:36.160]  got rid of the borders we imploded the Middle East we're now gonna flood well
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:39.160]  you've got to stabilize the Middle East like the Russians are trying to do so
[1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.280]  that doesn't happen it's just incredible Harvey you're on the air from Florida
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:47.840]  with Joe Scows in the Internet World Affairs brief go ahead hello again Alex
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:53.960]  hello Joe Scows and in this call was in memory of Dr. Stan Monti what a great
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:00.680]  guy go ahead a wonderful human being a dear friend you brought up earlier Alex
[1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:06.800]  and yes Joel about 9-11 and we know pretty much what happened but in any
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:11.560]  crime you look to see who stands to gain if you remember the origins of the
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:16.280]  Carlisle group when they bought up all the government contractors all the
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:20.680]  military contractors for about ten cents on the dollar Joe you're a military
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:27.280]  man yeah that's correct Frank Carlucci the bin Laden family were all
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:32.960]  involved in the in the Carlisle group and ever since those wars started in the
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:38.560]  Middle East and in North Africa the contractors made a fortune and they
[1:57:38.560 --> 1:57:43.240]  sold those companies out and they won legitimate Carlisle but Joe are you
[1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:46.920]  familiar with the workings of the Carlisle group because I think that's
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.960]  that's really the key excellent question Harvey thank you we're going to break
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:55.640]  here in a minute but absolutely the bin Laden's are one of the biggest defense
[1:57:55.640 --> 1:58:00.720]  contractor owners they made money off taking out Iraq and that's sick Joel no
[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:04.880]  it's very true and I've tracked the Carlisle group for many many decades that
[1:58:04.880 --> 1:58:11.000]  they are the core element of control in this military industrial complex of
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:16.160]  terrorism but remember it's a it's not a monetary conspiracy it's not just to get
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:21.240]  rich it's a globalist conspiracy that's the Borms and gets people who want to
[1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.960]  get rich into the process rewards them Carlo doesn't control this there's
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:31.920]  higher controls that are that the Carlisles are supporting absolutely
[1:58:31.920 --> 1:58:34.840]  they're doing it to build a one-world government one-world religion this
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:38.440]  is a cult we're fighting they'll be back in 70 seconds with more calls with

[2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:40.160]  developments bizarre bush insider calls trump liberal conspiracy theorist over
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:46.760]  9-11 remarks the former bush press secretary on the five that's coming up
[2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:50.680]  the start of the next segment our guest right now is Joel Scowze and I've kind
[2:00:50.680 --> 2:00:53.720]  of hogged him and haven't gone to many your calls but we're going to him now
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:59.840]  ed in FEMA region 9 what former state are you calling in from ed I'm calling
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:04.760]  from deep in the heart of north central Los Angeles County all right go ahead sir
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:09.440]  home home of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Los Angeles being
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:14.600]  chp where their motto is to first and ask questions second and gentlemen I want
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:18.280]  to first thank you for being accessible but I have a couple of questions for you
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:22.120]  and Joel and maybe you can break it down for me first of all I see that
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:26.480]  Chinese join in the fight with Russia and Syria and I want to know if that's a
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:30.480]  prelude to an invasion of North America is that like the scenario that we need
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:35.360]  to look out for um none of the presidential candidates talk about the
[2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:40.240]  um the vulnerability of our power grid and how those two countries could take
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:45.920]  us out that way along with the financial collapse and my third question is
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:50.640]  Joel I'm not sure if they're covered in his books but I'm an individual who
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:54.960]  lives from paycheck to paycheck so I can't afford some of the offers that you
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:59.280]  know you guys offer how do folks get prepared on a limited budget two big
[2:01:59.280 --> 2:02:03.520]  questions would the Chinese and Russians ever invade the United States and then
[2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:07.160]  be how does someone on a low budget small budget get prepared Joel Scowze
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:12.440]  first of all it is not true that the Chinese are in Syria and their carriers
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:18.760]  not in the area all of that was disinformation China is has a few
[2:02:18.760 --> 2:02:23.640]  advisors in there and intelligence people reaping the intelligence about US
[2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:29.000]  operations in there but there are no Chinese troops no Chinese I don't believe
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:33.640]  even in World War three that Russian China will attempt to invade the United
[2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:37.960]  States I mean it's just suicide with long lines of communication like that to
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:42.960]  run an occupation and again 600 million arms in this country at least I mean
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:49.760]  this would be suicide he's taking over a Guam Hawaii unique the United States and
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:54.320]  its bases then make a capitulate that's right they're attempting to blackmail us
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:03:00.040]  into submission they don't understand and in that regard the other questions
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:04.400]  Alex he was like how do you get prepared on a low budget small budget this is
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:08.120]  always tough because you know preparation is stock
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:15.040]  ours money one of the things that I've done for people is on my website
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:20.920]  Joel Scowze not they can get PDF versions of some of my books at half price
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:26.680]  I still think that most people need to have the you know the full color version
[2:03:26.680 --> 2:03:33.040]  because my books are like books you mean you may say $45 retail for a secure home
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.240]  but it saves you thousands of dollars in the building process that teaches you
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:42.800]  how to do it yourself same with the high security and how to do a shelter so those
[2:03:42.800 --> 2:03:47.880]  of us in the business are trying to provide ways you know to get these
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:52.040]  resources cheaper than on but remember it just takes a certain amount of money
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:58.000]  and you're gonna have to save and scrimp to be able to get ahead in this
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  business you know just cutting out going out to dinner and other things can save
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:06.240]  quite a bit of money over time Joel we're out of time we got 45 seconds Carol
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:10.560]  I'll get to you later you got to go says are the Russians in bed with the USA in
[2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:14.240]  the New World Order is there really one big combine I know your answer will be
[2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:19.200]  no three major predator groups all bidding for world government right that's
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:23.560]  correct they you must not misinterpret the fact that it's a one-way street
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:28.920]  globalist helping Russian China to build them as enemies but one way it's not you
[2:04:28.920 --> 2:04:33.920]  won't find collusion from Russia that it states coming back out of the

[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:46.400]  9-11 remarks establishment media getting desperate as they lose control of the
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:49.840]  narrative and this all started when Trump said you know 9-11 happened on your
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:54.240]  watch bush and it was your brother's watch so stop claiming I'm in that when
[2:09:54.240 --> 2:09:59.600]  it comes to geopolitical security issues and they said it's not his fault
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:05.000]  that happened Fox News Dana Perino formerly a press secretary under
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:08.600]  George W. Bush claimed Donald Trump is a liberal conspiracy theorist that's a
[2:10:08.600 --> 2:10:14.080]  quote pushing soft 9-11 trutherism because he challenged Bush's handling of
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:20.080]  the attack so now you're a 9-11 truther if you even admit they have a CIA memo
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:24.240]  saying bin Laden determined to attack using hijacked jet airliners which is a
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:28.080]  cover itself well I think it was a dismal weekend when you have liberal
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:32.000]  conspiracy theories being introduced by the Republican frontrunner she said on
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:37.720]  Fox is the five it's a soft trutherism it's what it's like soft racism and
[2:10:37.720 --> 2:10:41.560]  soft bigotry so you have a right-wing political correctness here when these
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:45.360]  people aren't right-wing at all you put it out there for a reason because you
[2:10:45.360 --> 2:10:51.560]  want to be provocative it was in the New York Post which is Republican basically
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:59.440]  the after 9-11 the headline Bush knew the car law group owned partially by the
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:05.920]  bin Laden's made all that money off the wars 15 of the 19 supposed hijackers
[2:11:05.920 --> 2:11:10.120]  came from Saudi Arabia none of them from Iraq and now we have new memos that have
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:16.760]  come out this weekend that Blair and Bush fixed intelligence to attack Iraq so
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:22.320]  in the time we've got I want to cover the waterfront with Dr. Steve Pachinic
[2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:26.760]  frequent guest on the show he's been coming on for almost 14 years he came on
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:38.800]  months after 9-11 about three months after he's an MD PhD American psychiatrist
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:41.960]  former State Department official we're gonna go to him in just a second I want
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:46.120]  to get his take on the fact that 9-11 truth starting to come out because in his
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:54.480]  email to me he said that was the first issue that he wanted to cover and so we
[2:11:54.480 --> 2:11:58.800]  are certainly gonna be getting into it also was Oregon a false flag like New
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:05.720]  Town he also says a major war will start between Israel and Palestine and he
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:09.480]  was talking about the whole speaker fight situation for the speaker of the
[2:12:09.480 --> 2:12:14.840]  House now that Boehner is set to leave in 11 days I'm not gonna hold my breath
[2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:19.800]  though who knows so that's all coming up at first here is the former White House
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:25.280]  press secretary for Bush acting like it's basically evil to point out that
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:31.880]  the government was in charge when 9-11 happened I mean that's a fact but now
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:37.360]  reality is being twisted just like they said there's no Obamacare fees if you
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:40.800]  don't get it no penalties well APs reporting they're now kicking in this
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:44.360]  is the attack on reality here's the clip
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:48.600]  doesn't do what Donald Trump do even only the farthest right lunatics has
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:53.560]  were truthers and this is now the Republican Party and you have formerly
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:56.280]  lunatics talking about something they have sane people actually having to
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:59.800]  spend time talking about this there are legitimate questions about 9-11 and
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.480]  preparedness in terms of the agencies not talking to each other the NSA the CIA
[2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:10.200]  there was a more fact-based way to attack George W. Bush if that's the way
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:13.920]  you wanted to get the jeb Bush and I think Donald went with actually even
[2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:16.400]  that wouldn't hold up because in almost every instance you have
[2:13:16.400 --> 2:13:21.280]  independence like for example the 9-11 Commission report great book I suggest
[2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:23.920]  that everybody that wants to be president should read it because oh great
[2:13:23.920 --> 2:13:28.080]  actions that were taken afterwards to try to protect and I got into several
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:31.720]  years ago on Hannity I said something like the president kept us safe the
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:36.520]  left has never let me up on that because I didn't say after 9-11 obviously
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:44.840]  one of the weeks we're on this show in 2011 we mentioned that we had George
[2:13:44.840 --> 2:13:48.320]  Bush kept us safe we said it like that I agree that that's enough and we got now
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:53.320]  I read her quote about left-wing conspiracy theorist truth or ism but
[2:13:53.320 --> 2:13:57.400]  that's the rest of her statement and it's all about consensus get up there in
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:02.960]  a psych warfare at junior high level it's not sophisticated and go just like
[2:14:02.960 --> 2:14:08.080]  jeb Bush just said it's not proper to question 9-11 and even say his brother
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.680]  could have protected us so you can't even do that he said no one reasonable
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:16.760]  does that and then weak-minded people go okay these aren't the droids we're
[2:14:16.760 --> 2:14:24.840]  looking for move along this is the equivalent of hypnotizing people just
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:28.400]  you don't look at this you don't question it move along and joining us talk
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:35.240]  about that is a psychiatrist and a of course a medical doctor as well Dr.
[2:14:35.240 --> 2:14:39.160]  Steve Pachennick Steve Pachennick.com also co-wrote some of the books of
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:42.920]  course with the late great man that brought you the Patriot games and so
[2:14:42.920 --> 2:14:50.160]  many other bestsellers Tom Clancy and he joins us right now Dr. Pachennick a lot
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:53.800]  to cover good to have you back with us it's always a pleasure Alex and I want
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:58.840]  to thank you and particularly your audience for the past 14 years for being
[2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:04.440]  able to be truthers and the so-called marginalized majority and I'll tell you
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:12.040]  why Jeb Bush like his former brother Bush Jr. and his father Bush senior are not
[2:15:12.040 --> 2:15:16.600]  very bright people and he literally fell in love in what we call a psyops
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:21.400]  program where he thought he become president of the United States and I
[2:15:21.400 --> 2:15:25.840]  warned them repeatedly if he becomes if he comes to the forefront we will tear
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:32.280]  him apart and basically will use him as a target to get to 9-11 and he fell for
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:37.080]  it and now that Trump came to the forefront Carson but that is the
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:43.440]  expression of the majority of us who now know after 14 years that 70% of us
[2:15:43.440 --> 2:15:48.160]  believe it wasn't inside job and in fact it wasn't inside job the real truth
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:54.440]  is the architects of America myself where Bush's own deputy Secretary of
[2:15:54.440 --> 2:15:58.800]  Defense the key man in his administration even admitted to me it was a
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:03.920]  standout false flag and I'll go before US prosecutor given the name as well as
[2:16:03.920 --> 2:16:08.520]  the name is to CIA operatives who were involved and had to admit that it was a
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:12.960]  standout and false flag as well as the fact that the administration has been
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:17.520]  very afraid of me including the fact that the head of Cyber Command today
[2:16:17.520 --> 2:16:21.840]  that I was the most dangerous man in this country for the simple reason that
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:26.840]  they know that I can run psyops operations against them which I had for
[2:16:26.840 --> 2:16:32.640]  14 years as well as psyops operation overseas where we were successful now I
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:37.080]  don't say this about myself I'm saying this to you Alex because you were there
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:41.680]  when I needed you and when the truth is needed you I am very proud to be a
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:46.720]  truth there and I'm very proud to be a so-called conspirator because in fact
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:51.560]  Jeff Bush knows very well and I've met him and I told him that his brother's
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:57.280]  lucky not to be assassinated because we want him in there in order for he and
[2:16:57.280 --> 2:17:03.320]  his family to deserve the punishment that the Bushes deserve for 50 years of
[2:17:03.320 --> 2:17:08.120]  miscreant behavior against the United States it didn't just start with Jeff
[2:17:08.120 --> 2:17:14.240]  Bush who was a liar a conspirator a totally inept entrepreneur whose wife
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:19.160]  was indicted up to buy the customs his daughter's been in jail whose own
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:23.200]  family is the disgrace to the conservative values who he himself is a
[2:17:23.200 --> 2:17:27.760]  disgrace as well as Marvin and Neil those are facts they were involved in
[2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:32.960]  Silverado I had to take over the SNL's in Maryland and then I had to go after
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:39.720]  Marvin and Mel and Neil in 1980s but they were excused from prosecution while
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:44.360]  we prosecuted people 1980s so my involvement doesn't just go back with
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.840]  serving Bush senior under the Reagan administration it goes back 20 years
[2:17:48.840 --> 2:17:53.120]  before that and let me get back to the truth which was one thing that this is
[2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:58.200]  that you people have always asked did George Bush senior actually fly out of
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:03.880]  a plane and die die the answer is no he was never shot down the truth of the
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.080]  matter is that everyone who flew around him in World War two knew he was not
[2:18:08.080 --> 2:18:13.680]  shot down but he began the big lie of all life and it continued in the family
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:19.560]  now one person in that family has served our country nobly or patriotically and
[2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:24.800]  in fact Jeff Bush as long as he was out there was a perfect target for me and
[2:18:24.800 --> 2:18:30.140]  others who could take him apart and come in from the extreme right or what we
[2:18:30.140 --> 2:18:34.680]  call the truthers and the conservative element and allow a guy like Trump and
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:39.880]  Carson to come in and say you know what we feel we talk for the majority of the
[2:18:39.880 --> 2:18:44.400]  silent majority another was the marginalized majority sure what do you
[2:18:44.400 --> 2:18:47.560]  make of the current situation family
[2:18:47.560 --> 2:18:52.760]  instrumental to this country than the Bush and the Clinton let me repeat that
[2:18:52.760 --> 2:18:58.360]  again I work in intelligence I ran psyops operation I work very closely with
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:03.160]  the Bushes I know Roger Ailes of Fox so I know exactly what they're trying to
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:08.080]  cover up and what they're doing it is not working thanks to you Alex and thanks
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:12.160]  to the American public they're falling apart well I don't want the thanks that
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:16.480]  Bush is there easy it is for me to attack them and the United States to
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:21.440]  attack Jed and the Bush family in total I'm sorry go ahead Alex no no we we've
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:26.320]  got to go to break but I want to come back and get more into this 9-11 being
[2:19:26.320 --> 2:19:29.800]  brought up by Trump he obviously knows what he's doing of course picking a
[2:19:29.800 --> 2:19:33.360]  fight with him I want to get your view on Donald Trump can he be trusted what
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:37.640]  you think of Carson where you see all of this going what you think about the
[2:19:37.640 --> 2:19:41.960]  Russians over there in Syria the fact that it's known that our government's
[2:19:41.960 --> 2:19:46.880]  running al Qaeda now I mean stuff that people just couldn't believe five years
[2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:54.200]  ago is now being accepted and how do you think it's gonna backfire on people like
[2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:59.800]  Purina the lady on the five show whenever she sits there and does that was 59
[2:19:59.800 --> 2:20:03.320]  when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year just this past August was

[2:24:21.400 --> 2:24:26.080]  Well, the war to take over was lost. The globalists did get control but now
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:31.720]  there's a war to expose them and they are losing. Dr. Steve Pachennick is
[2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:36.440]  our guest. StevePachennick.com. The military three years ago, two years ago,
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:41.440]  said we will not be the Air Force for Al Qaeda in Syria. We have seen members of
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:48.360]  Congress come out and expose the 28 pages on 9-11. The work you the audience
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:51.640]  has done and people like Steve Pachennick and Architects and Engineers
[2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:57.320]  for 9-11 Truth and Countless Others have done is now bearing fruit and it's
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:01.200]  going to continue. People don't buy the Bin Laden hoax. Psyhurst came out and said
[2:25:01.200 --> 2:25:07.920]  it's fake, you know, 13 years after Pachennick did. So the truth is no one
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:13.080]  buys what they're doing. They're losing credibility worldwide. Geopolitically,
[2:25:13.080 --> 2:25:18.120]  what does this do to the criminal cabals on the inside knowing that people now
[2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:22.920]  in the court of public opinion are aware of who really carried out 9-11 and how
[2:25:22.920 --> 2:25:26.760]  does that affect their next move and then your take on Donald Trump, your take on
[2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:31.080]  Carson and where the country is. Thank you very much. The truth of the matter is
[2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:35.800]  this is one of the most phenomenal American revolutions I have ever seen
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:40.440]  and the one we were waiting for Alex. I thank you and I thank the audience and I
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:44.520]  thank the so-called alternative media which really became the mainstream
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:49.360]  media. The reality is Trump had been monitoring this mainstream media for a
[2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:54.560]  long time. I knew it. He knew it. Many of us had known that and in fact when we put
[2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:00.000]  his name up for the next presidency, he took it and basically ran with it and
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:04.920]  this is the true expression of the moral majority and the fact that we are so
[2:26:04.920 --> 2:26:09.480]  tired of the people who committed the crime at 9-11. Now once Trump gets in,
[2:26:09.480 --> 2:26:14.000]  my suspicion is many of them will be arrested and that's what I think will
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:18.160]  happen in the long run. I don't know Trump personally. I do know his background. I
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.400]  know a lot about his character. He is a man who will do exactly what he said.
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:26.480]  Ben Carson, I have to know a little bit better because I was at John Hopkins
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:30.000]  Medical Center. He's a well-known neurosurgeon. He's a man of his
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:35.120]  convictions and believe me, once he puts his mind to something that is immoral as
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:40.600]  the 9-11 stand-down was, there will be consequences. So in fact we have to look
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:44.240]  at this as a very positive movement. We're in fact, we're the people who've
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:47.840]  committed this and we have the names. It's not as if we don't know the names.
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:53.000]  It's the Adles and the Condoleezza Rice and the Rumsfelds and the Chenees and a
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.280]  whole bunch of them, even Sandy Berger who worked on them, Clinton. These are the
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:02.200]  names that will be eventually known very well and possibly arrested in time
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:06.960]  and that depends on the American public because now they're very scared. The
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:12.680]  backlash was huge. They never, never expected us to come in and be able to
[2:27:12.680 --> 2:27:17.400]  pronounce the truth 14 years later. But thanks to you, the audience, and the
[2:27:17.400 --> 2:27:21.120]  American public, God bless them. Please don't give us any thanks for doing our
[2:27:21.120 --> 2:27:25.040]  duty plus we don't want to take credit for it. Let me explain something.
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:29.220]  Doing your duty and going beyond the call of duty is really what you did 14
[2:27:29.220 --> 2:27:33.560]  years ago. You were a very young man who took a very big risk on someone you
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:38.120]  didn't know, namely me, and I never forgot that, nor did the American public.
[2:27:38.120 --> 2:27:43.400]  And you deserve that, Alex. That's why CNN and Fox News are in trouble. I know
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:47.400]  Roger and I like Roger Ailes, but he's finished. He knows that with Charlie
[2:27:47.400 --> 2:27:51.560]  Crowdama whom I know, really he can't go anywhere. They just repeat the same
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:56.360]  nonsense Charlie trained under me at Harvard University. He's a nice guy, but
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:01.240]  he's not really in the front line of combat and intelligence. Now let me get
[2:28:01.240 --> 2:28:04.880]  to where the real problem is. Not only will we turn around and get rid of these
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:09.680]  people, but Russia in effect watched what we were doing. And Putin went from a
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:14.320]  tactical genius to a chessboard genius, and he understood that our military
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:19.800]  could not affect a successful combat mission. And he saw that repeatedly in
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:24.920]  Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Sudan. What he did in turn was to inform us,
[2:28:24.920 --> 2:28:28.960]  basically the intelligence service, that he was going in and he told Obama and
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:33.760]  he was going to sacrifice Russian men and women, as well as airplanes and
[2:28:33.760 --> 2:28:37.960]  advanced technology, to do the dirty work that we couldn't do. While we were
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:42.120]  playing around, not knowing what to do, and having no strategy whatsoever, in
[2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:47.680]  Syria and Iran, I suggested that the Russians come in, do our dirty work, pay
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:51.520]  the price that they had, and return for which they would come back into the fold
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:56.400]  and be part of an alliance that would be quite strong. And that's exactly what
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:29:01.200]  they're doing. I don't condone what Bashar Assad did, but I do know that he
[2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:04.600]  was there to protect the Christians. And one of the issues that came up in your
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:08.720]  show, and I said it repeatedly, Christians were being slaughtered all over the
[2:29:08.720 --> 2:29:14.400]  Middle East, thanks to the sea I created, Al Qaeda, ISIS, and all the other groups
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:18.880]  that were funded by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Dubai. Now what happened is we
[2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:23.920]  strategically involved Iran that has no qualms with the Christians, the Russians
[2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:29.800]  who represent Christianity, and in fact, are fighting back on all the
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:32.440]  elements that are involved in Syria.
[2:29:32.440 --> 2:29:35.200]  Dr. Bochenik, stay there, riveting stuff, and again, you've been a member of the
[2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:38.280]  Council on Foreign Relations, you've talked to all these people. Bochenik
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:42.280]  really has been doing the things he says, he's doing here on air. It's pretty
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.360]  amazing, and he of course also ran the famous Camp David Accords, as well, and
[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:50.600]  is credited with helping get that deal. We're on the march, the Empire's on the
[2:29:50.600 --> 2:29:56.680]  run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.680 --> 2:30:05.120]  The 21 gun salute, a time-honored tradition that has been celebrating
[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:10.920]  veterans for years, is now banned by an Iowa high school. According to an NBC
[2:30:10.920 --> 2:30:15.160]  affiliate, administrators at Bell Plain High School say that the salute quote
[2:30:15.160 --> 2:30:19.880]  promotes gun violence, end quote, but common sense hasn't completely left the
[2:30:19.880 --> 2:30:24.280]  area. A member of the American Legion, a veterans organization, offered up
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:27.920]  property near the school so the assembly could continue, but the group is
[2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:32.000]  disappointed over the school's decision and fear it could reverberate to other
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:36.560]  parts of the state. Similar efforts to demonized firearms have already popped
[2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:40.600]  up in other schools across the country. In other schools across the nation,
[2:30:40.600 --> 2:30:46.160]  anti-gun hysteria has manifested in students being suspended or expelled for
[2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:51.240]  playing with toy guns, biting pastries into gun shapes, and even making gun
[2:30:51.240 --> 2:30:57.720]  gestures with their hands. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[2:32:58.560 --> 2:33:05.360]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem. Government
[2:33:05.360 --> 2:33:10.480]  is the problem. From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has
[2:33:10.480 --> 2:33:15.400]  become too complex to be managed by self-rule. That government by an elite
[2:33:15.400 --> 2:33:22.440]  group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[2:33:22.440 --> 2:33:28.560]  If you've been successful, you don't, you didn't get there on your own.
[2:33:32.120 --> 2:33:38.880]  If you've got a business, that, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:44.600]  You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as
[2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:48.800]  nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our
[2:33:48.800 --> 2:33:53.080]  problems. They'll warn that the tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:56.800]  You should reject these voices.
[2:34:04.360 --> 2:34:10.320]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the
[2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:14.520]  national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:19.800]  national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well
[2:34:19.800 --> 2:34:22.800]  funded.

[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:48.800]  That's Vitalik Abrien saying we're gonna go back to Dr. Steve Pachinic a minute.
[2:34:48.800 --> 2:34:52.880]  I want to go to calls all over the map, 9-11 and drills, preparing for what's
[2:34:52.880 --> 2:34:57.880]  happening in the economy, what are solutions to what's happening. Obama and
[2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:01.160]  Putin, Russia, we got a lot of questions and comments from myself and Dr.
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:05.840]  Steve Pachinic. StevePachinic.com is his website. By the way, we're funded by you
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:09.600]  out there, not even so much sponsors. That's why it's imperative if you believe
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:13.480]  in this info, I want to keep spreading it to go to infowarstore.com and check out
[2:35:13.480 --> 2:35:18.400]  the, it's got to be approaching a thousand products that are stuff I use.

[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:32.680]  Hillary for Prison 2016 is one of our best selling t-shirts ever. It says
[2:35:32.680 --> 2:35:37.200]  legalizedfreedominfowars.com on the back end. Sure, there's a bunch of crooks, but
[2:35:37.200 --> 2:35:41.320]  the idea of Hillary for Prison shows they're all a bunch of criminals. That's
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:44.560]  what they're talking about in Piching, Obama. They're talking about criminal
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:50.920]  charges for Hillary now, mainstream news. This is the idea. Getting back in their
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:54.640]  face. Plus, you get a great t-shirt that looks like a campaign shirt. That's a sick
[2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:59.120]  joke that helps fund the operation. It's been sold out for over a month and a
[2:35:59.120 --> 2:36:04.080]  half. Supermail vitality is simply what is it? 10 known concentrated cold pressed

[2:36:25.400 --> 2:36:31.320]  And again, it's so important for folks to go to the website and read the reviews
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:36.160]  for yourself. Here's just some of the reviews that came in yesterday. They're
[2:36:36.160 --> 2:36:39.720]  coming in every few hours, but this is what we printed off yesterday. This is
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:47.280]  info warrior in Haasville, Kentucky. I'm pronouncing that right. H-A-W-E-S-VILS
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:52.760]  Kentucky. There's nothing bad about Supermail. It's the best product I found
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.960]  and it works. I use it daily. It's great to take at work and to work out with.
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:37:01.560]  Alex Jones has great products. I've been telling all my friends about this
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:04.640]  product. Alex Jones are the best. No, you're the best for supporting us. Thank
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:08.920]  you so much. It was a five star review. Here's another five star review by
[2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:14.160]  Guide in Boise, Idaho. This is far superior to other products I've tried in
[2:37:14.160 --> 2:37:18.640]  the past. Stamina, clarity, especially in the mornings with no running out of gas
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:22.160]  in the afternoon. It works for me. I noticed a better recovery from my
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:26.440]  workouts. I would recommend this to a friend. There's over a thousand reviews
[2:37:26.440 --> 2:37:30.280]  just for Supermails, Superfemales. Pretty much the same compound. It has a
[2:37:30.280 --> 2:37:34.600]  couple different things in it. It's available at infowarslife.com. And
[2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:39.320]  again, I want to thank all of you that have been purchasing the products
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:42.600]  because we couldn't fund this operation without you. We have a lot of other
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:46.680]  specials running right now with free shipping on water filters and 10% off,
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:49.800]  free shipping on storeable foods. And we don't have storeable foods and things
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:54.040]  because we're living in fear. We're trying to be prepared. We're trying to be
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:57.800]  ready in these crazy times. Now, Dr. Pachennik, you've gotten into the state
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:02.960]  of the world, the loss of confidence in the system, what Russia is doing. I want
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:06.720]  to cover a bunch of waterfront points before we go to these phone calls. What
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:10.680]  else is big on your radar screen right now? What do you expect the
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:15.600]  establishment to try to do to go after Trump? What do you expect Obama to do?
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:20.720]  Why is Hillary going around saying repeal the Second Amendment and maybe we
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:24.320]  should have mass gun confiscation? Doesn't she know that's incredibly
[2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:30.000]  unpopular or are they that disconnected from reality? As a Psyop, why would she
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:34.440]  be trying to do that? Well, Hillary is in a very serious problem. And once again,
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:39.120]  I want to thank your audience and you. What we did was, in fact, to do a Psyops
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:43.440]  on Hillary, which was in effect to create Bernie Sanders to bring them out,
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:50.000]  to co-opt her extreme left, and then to bring Biden in to co-opt your middle,
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:54.560]  and then to break up and fractionate her system. The reason Hillary is in
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.920]  trouble is because thanks to our FBI and James Comey, who's the new director of
[2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:04.360]  the FBI, she's going to be prosecuted because Obama made a statement with that,
[2:39:04.360 --> 2:39:09.120]  which was totally inappropriate, and the FBI was furious as well as many of us
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:14.680]  who work with the FBI. And that was that Hillary, in his 60-minute point, Obama
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:18.880]  said, oh, Hillary made the mistake, but it didn't affect national security. That
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.360]  was not true. Obama lied again. In fact, Comey and the FBI operatives and agents
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:29.120]  who worked diligently all the time, they were ready to indict betrayers who had
[2:39:29.120 --> 2:39:33.800]  severe, severe infractions against national security and would have been in
[2:39:33.800 --> 2:39:38.600]  prison had Obama not said something. So they're furious at this point again that
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:43.640]  Obama is trying to make light of the fact that Hillary may go to prison and
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:48.000]  Trump is correct. She should be going to prison. I worked in the State Department,
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:50.920]  the two people who worked for me, Pat Kennedy, the Under Secretary for
[2:39:50.920 --> 2:39:55.600]  Management, was involved with Hillary in the collusion to get a private server.
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:40:00.160]  And Eric Boswell, who was head of diplomatic security, both were involved
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:05.240]  in Benghazi, both have to be held accountable for collusion in a conspiracy
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:10.480]  to defraud and violate federal laws. I know these guys. They worked for me.
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:14.880]  There was no way that Hillary could have done this on her own. So, in fact, we
[2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:19.960]  should have faith in our internal systems because Congress is coming around.
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:24.000]  The FBI does come around. Our intelligence community, who does not agree with
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:28.240]  Obama and the Bushes, have helped out in many different ways. I can't go on the
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:32.840]  specifics, but they made sure that our soldiers did not get killed. And, in fact,
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:37.240]  you haven't heard of any Americans that are getting killed in Syria or Iraq when,
[2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:40.800]  in fact, our intelligence covert operations are working there
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:47.680]  and tediously, and they can't be identified. So, we are functioning, and
[2:40:47.680 --> 2:40:52.800]  we're functioning along the lines of patriotism and a new revolution. The
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:56.880]  Hillary's, the Bushes, the Clintons are no longer relevant. They've been
[2:40:56.880 --> 2:41:02.200]  marginalized because they attempted to grab power so obviously, so ostentatiously,
[2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:06.760]  and the American public eventually began to realize what was happening thanks to
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:11.200]  your show and many other shows. Please don't thank us anymore. Well, Alec, that's the
[2:41:11.200 --> 2:41:14.760]  reality, and thanks to many of the bloggers and those who really stood up,
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:19.920]  now we have been able to corner this dynasty, the Clintons, as well as the
[2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:24.040]  Bushes, and I know the Clintons well, I know her daughter well, and they should
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:29.280]  be prosecuted accordingly. Bill should be prosecuted, Sandy Berger, who was his
[2:41:29.280 --> 2:41:31.920]  national security... Let me throw this in, because we've already gone over who should
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:34.760]  be indicted, and I agree with you, but it's certainly going to be a national
[2:41:34.760 --> 2:41:38.040]  investigation opening all this up, and then it'll fall like a house of cards,
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:44.720]  but expanding on that, clearly, I kept saying, how delusional are they to have
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:49.880]  Clinton and Bush dynasties run again knowing nobody wants them? Are you
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:54.080]  saying good people and intelligence agencies and their own campaign
[2:41:54.080 --> 2:41:58.000]  people suckered them, and this has all been a trap? Because that's what it looks
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:01.240]  like to me. Well, it's not all of them. There are people like myself and others who've been
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:06.640]  in PSYOP's operations, and we suckered them, because this has been a 14-year
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:10.840]  operation. It's not something that just came overnight, and Jeb was so stupid
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:15.360]  that he literally reiterated what his brother said, and Rumsfeld quoted about
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:19.880]  Pearl Harbor. So they were suckered. They've been suckered in for a long time,
[2:42:19.880 --> 2:42:23.640]  because people like myself and others have monitored them for a long period.
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:27.960]  They've been warned repeatedly through blogs, and despite all of that, they went
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:32.040]  in because they are self-delusional, and in the business of manipulation of
[2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:37.720]  self-delusional grandiose, paranoid people, it's not hard to manipulate them. The one
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:42.640]  who was not manipulated was Putin, and he understood very quickly how to move in
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:48.200]  in a country that had no leadership, no direction on the foreign policy side, not
[2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:52.320]  on the domestic side. On the domestic side, we were extremely effective with
[2:42:52.320 --> 2:42:57.920]  lowering the ruble of the ability to make Russia a weaker economy and to be
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:43:02.040]  able to monitor that. So let me ask you this question. What do you expect Turkey
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:07.320]  and Saudi Arabia to do now that they're not going to be able to break up Syria as
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:13.160]  easily? Are they... Turkey, Erdogan has got a very serious problem. He has been
[2:43:13.160 --> 2:43:17.400]  caught putting his hand in the dishes and killing Kurds instead of fighting
[2:43:17.400 --> 2:43:22.440]  ISIS. He created ISIS. The Kurds know that, the Turks know that, the Americans know
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:28.640]  that. Now he has to pay the price. Either he works with the American military, or he
[2:43:28.640 --> 2:43:32.960]  goes against it, and he will be in serious trouble in his coming election. When he
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:39.280]  blew up all these Kurds, he put himself in harm's way. As for Saudi Arabia, I've
[2:43:39.280 --> 2:43:43.840]  told you years ago, the point of putting Iran into play and making it a Middle
[2:43:43.840 --> 2:43:49.400]  Eastern hegemony was to in fact neutralize all the neocons in the United
[2:43:49.400 --> 2:43:54.360]  States, as well as Saudi... So is Obama breaking more with the neocons now, as
[2:43:54.360 --> 2:43:58.880]  some are saying? We are totally broken up with the neocons. The neocons have been
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:04.080]  identified from Newland to Hadley to all of them, Wolfowitz, and they still work
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:09.720]  with Jeb, and now they're going to be rounded up psychologically and in fact
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:13.720]  incarcerated eventually. They know that. They thought they could get away with
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:18.640]  much of this, but when in fact Iran came in, and Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are in
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:22.480]  trouble, Dubai's in trouble, Jordan's in trouble, all the Sunni...
[2:44:22.480 --> 2:44:26.640]  Let me throw this in there. Four years ago, when the Libya thing was going on, you
[2:44:26.640 --> 2:44:31.160]  came on and you said, our military is not going to put up with destabilizing
[2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:35.880]  these countries and putting radicals in. You said big foundations are doing this,
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:39.840]  it's going to blow up, and then we did see the military come out and hold up the
[2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:43.560]  signs saying we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force, so they changed the
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:47.320]  name to ISIS to confuse the narrative. That didn't work. I had major whistle
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:51.000]  blowers on. The Justice Department called up and threatened to arrest them. They
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.640]  threatened us. They've been threatening us. We just said, whatever, we're just
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:57.160]  standing up to you, and so now like a house of cards, it's starting to fall,
[2:44:57.160 --> 2:45:01.360]  but I don't want to be... I don't want to be, you know, overconfident here, but it
[2:45:01.360 --> 2:45:06.480]  is true that when push came to shove, when it became completely clear, our
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:10.800]  military said we are not going to aid al-Qaeda murdering Christians, and people
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:13.600]  are like, well, big deal. They should have said no. Well, within the power
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:18.680]  structure, it's very hard to do the right thing, but I think this revealed the true
[2:45:18.680 --> 2:45:26.160]  middle rot beyond Machiavelli that is going on in this elite, that how did they
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:30.080]  think they could really get away with turning al-Qaeda loose all over the world
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:34.280]  while claiming they're fighting al-Qaeda? I mean, do they understand, because I
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:38.880]  think that's what I'm getting from you, do they understand how much they've
[2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:42.800]  been exposed, Dr. Pachennick? They're beginning to understand. When I said it
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:46.840]  four years ago on your show that the military wouldn't tolerate it, it wasn't
[2:45:46.840 --> 2:45:51.680]  wishful thinking. I knew Dempsey, and I knew his people around him, and the Navy,
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:56.600]  and the commanders, and all. These are very honorable men and women. They would
[2:45:56.600 --> 2:46:01.360]  not tolerate what we call the standout that was done in Africa, that was done
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:05.680]  all around there. In eight hours, there's no reason why our military could not have
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:10.520]  gotten to Libya. Every military officer knew that 12 Navy officers were
[2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:16.080]  dismissed, and in fact, when you start to play with our military, and this has
[2:46:16.080 --> 2:46:20.560]  been true my whole life. Now, one of the things your audience does not know, I was
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:25.560]  a military officer while I was a deputy assistant secretary, so I not only held
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:29.840]  the position of deputy assistant secretary and a military Navy officer, I
[2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:34.120]  also held an intelligence position. So throughout my whole career, including
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:39.440]  now, our military has been the backbone of our country, as well as our
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:44.000]  intelligence service. From time to time, they get into trouble, or they're told to
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:47.240]  do things they don't want to do, but when they do the things they don't want to do
[2:46:47.240 --> 2:46:52.280]  like 9-11, they will come back with a vengeance, and so will our military. Our
[2:46:52.280 --> 2:46:56.480]  officers at the major and lieutenant colonel levels and the colonel and general
[2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:02.400]  levels are formidable. These are men who have many degrees. Dempsey, who I've met,
[2:47:02.400 --> 2:47:06.720]  I had a discussion with, he was willing to go up against the president of the
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:11.440]  United States and refuse orders to do things. Now, that will be hopefully
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:15.040]  followed by the commandant of the Marine Corps, the chairman of the Joint
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:20.360]  Chiefs of Staff, as well as Air Force officers and Navy officers, but we have
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:25.360]  to thank our military and our intelligence. We do. There's so much
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:28.080]  opposition to the globalists there, and actually people trying to stand up for
[2:47:28.080 --> 2:47:31.800]  real American interests. We did this piece of last week, I don't know if you saw it,
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:35.640]  about the mental illness of Obama showing you six years ago saying, and a
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:39.800]  year ago saying it, now major diplomats are saying it, and others are saying, and
[2:47:39.800 --> 2:47:44.280]  he's giving speeches where he looks like he's on painkillers or something. Do you
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:49.400]  have any intel specifically or just as a psychiatrist watching him? I mean, are you
[2:47:49.400 --> 2:47:53.360]  doing this from a further away diagnosis? Because now people are seconding and
[2:47:53.360 --> 2:47:57.600]  thirding what you said, or do you have intel that Obama is mentally ill, and if
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:02.160]  so, what is his mental problem? I'm not gonna say he's mentally ill. He was born
[2:48:02.160 --> 2:48:08.280]  with sociopathy. He grew up with sociopathy. The system, particularly the CIA at
[2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:14.680]  the time, read him, fostered him. People like Geithner, Peter Geithner, when
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:18.760]  Timothy said he didn't know, they lied. The whole system lied. The Pritzker's
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:25.000]  lied, who were the former allies of Al Capone. I mean, the whole Chicago mob
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:32.680]  lied. Ari Emanuel, Emanuel, the whole family lied. So you have a product here
[2:48:32.680 --> 2:48:36.680]  that comes out of Chicago out of a collusive element that doesn't have to
[2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:41.440]  be paranoid, but he himself is not qualified to be any type of leader. He
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:45.920]  never had it. He was never capable of it, but they thought having a black, young
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:51.720]  man who had a Muslim name would in somehow change the perception of America.
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:56.800]  It was a serious mistake. He learned all the technology that we knew from DARPA,
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:01.160]  Defense Advanced Research Projects, came into power and didn't really know how to
[2:49:01.160 --> 2:49:06.080]  wield it. He then started false flags. Newtown was an obvious false flag, and
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:09.960]  then we have Oregon, which is a repetition of Newtown. I mean, how many
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:14.160]  Asperger's mothers and kids can be shooting all those people? Even my
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:19.160]  special forces can't recruit Asperger, so this is really ridiculous. What you
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:23.720]  have here is a man who's totally alienated from what's going on. I don't
[2:49:23.720 --> 2:49:27.120]  want to give him mental health label because I don't think he deserves it. He
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:32.480]  has to have an accountability as a man who was not qualified to do what he did,
[2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:37.920]  was not qualified to be president, and in fact, indicts the Democratic Party so
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:42.360]  seriously that they were stupid enough, and I know the people involved, some of
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:46.320]  the liberals and famous congressmen who thought this was a great idea, and I
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:50.440]  said it was a stupid idea because he would eventually fail and he would
[2:49:50.440 --> 2:49:55.760]  destroy our country. Now, thanks to you and many others, we have been able to
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:00.880]  turn this tide around and see what will happen. If Trump comes in and Ben
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:05.360]  Carson comes in, now I will be very serious to your audience. I have warned
[2:50:05.360 --> 2:50:10.600]  both candidates that they are targets for assassination, and the reason that is
[2:50:10.600 --> 2:50:16.080]  the case is that they both are able to manipulate emotions very effectively.
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:20.680]  Plus, you have families out there and the dynasties who've known to kill people,
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:24.880]  the Bushes and the Clintons. That's not theory. That's not some make-believe
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:29.360]  notion. That is the notion that the Secret Service has to take very seriously,
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:34.360]  and also, we Americans have to hold the Secret Service accountable for what was
[2:50:34.360 --> 2:50:39.040]  done in 9-11 because there's no other unit in the American government who knew
[2:50:39.040 --> 2:50:44.480]  more about 9-11 than the Secret Service who had to protect both Bush, Cheney, and
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:48.200]  Mr. Mueller. Sure, I've talked to high-level Secret Service and they won't
[2:50:48.200 --> 2:50:50.840]  tell me anything secret. I don't want to know anything secret, but they tell me.
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:55.280]  Secret Service does not serve America. Stay there. Let's go. We've got to go to break, but they just tell me,
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:50:59.480]  it's worse than you say, Alex. That's what I'm always told. It's worse than you say.

[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:06.120]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[2:53:06.120 --> 2:53:09.160]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens
[2:53:09.160 --> 2:53:11.560]  that are beginning to emerge in the world today?

[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:29.960]  I want to go to a couple phone calls here, like Shane in Nevada is asking what are solutions.
[2:54:29.960 --> 2:54:32.120]  Tom in Tennessee, others will do five minutes the next hour.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:36.400]  Dr. Pachennick, then I hand the baton to David Knight.
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:41.360]  British nurse has gotten Ebola relapsed for nine months of being clear.
[2:54:41.360 --> 2:54:47.120]  Bernie Sanders, 1985 interview, we're going to play part of it, endorsing Fidel Castro and socialism,
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:50.480]  gun confiscation, you name it, Hillary's calling for.
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:55.760]  We're going to get into Paul Ryan and the push to be a Bainer's heir apparent and more,
[2:54:55.760 --> 2:55:01.680]  but it's a big deal to see Bainer having a step down and there is a big push.
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:06.960]  There are people fighting back and so that's the good news, folks, is that America is not going
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:10.800]  quietly into totalitarianism without a fight.
[2:55:10.800 --> 2:55:13.280]  Dr. Pachennick is our guest.
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:14.720]  Let's talk to Shane in Nevada.
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:15.360]  You're on the air.
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:15.760]  Go ahead.
[2:55:17.280 --> 2:55:17.520]  Yeah.
[2:55:17.520 --> 2:55:20.000]  Hey, Alex, I'm a vet.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:21.600]  I was in the army for eight years.
[2:55:22.880 --> 2:55:24.400]  I'm receiving disability.
[2:55:24.400 --> 2:55:29.520]  I do own a firearm, but now there's the government saying that I'm a terrorist and all
[2:55:29.520 --> 2:55:34.480]  sorts of stuff. I was just wondering, how can we get the word out to more people about this
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:38.640]  and if we can do a march on Washington without sparking the war?
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:40.160]  That's a great question, Shane.
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:44.080]  Dr. Pachennick, what is the propaganda push?
[2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:49.200]  Some under Bush, but like 10 times as much under Obama, where they say the founding fathers wouldn't
[2:55:49.200 --> 2:55:55.520]  be in today's military, returning vets, the number one terror threat, a new Justice Department
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:00.480]  unit to quote, go after the Tea Party, federalization of local police.
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:05.360]  Because all that does is wake up the military and police in my experience when they call
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:10.640]  them into briefing rooms and literally badmouth Thomas Jefferson and George Washington and
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:15.040]  the free market. That's totally woken up the military is what I found.
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:16.320]  Are they that stupid?
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:18.880]  I mean, are they really that dumb?
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:22.880]  Because I never thought of myself as that smart, and I can look at that and tell
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:24.320]  that's how I'd wake the country up.
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:29.360]  Well, you hit it right on the head. What they are doing is something we call in the
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:34.560]  psychological warfare paradoxical intention. In other words, many of us, people like me,
[2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:40.320]  want them to do that in order to show how stupid they really are and incompetent.
[2:56:40.320 --> 2:56:45.840]  You have to remember that no one in that White House either served in the military or wasn't
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:51.440]  combat like this good man who's on the phone. The answer is no, they will not take away your guns
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:56.960]  because they've been warned that if in fact they want to take the guns from anybody,
[2:56:56.960 --> 2:57:02.000]  and they've tried, God only knows how many absurd stand-downs and false flags we've had,
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:05.440]  including Newtown and Oregon and other places which are unknown.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:13.920]  The fact is you cannot round up all the 365 million guns that are out there, nor would they,
[2:57:13.920 --> 2:57:18.160]  nor could they rescind any of the amendments that they would like to.
[2:57:18.160 --> 2:57:25.040]  This is all a bravado effort which will never come to fruition. What in fact will happen is
[2:57:25.040 --> 2:57:30.320]  that when Trump and the Tea Party moves in, and by the way, my candidate for Speaker,
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:36.000]  I sent it in two weeks ago to the Republican Party as Daniel Webster, who comes from the Tea
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:41.520]  Party, comes from Northern Florida and represents all the values that we believe in, strong Christian
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:49.280]  values, a less of a federal government, and has been in the state government for 25 years.
[2:57:49.280 --> 2:57:56.160]  Maynard, his stupidity was obvious when he picked up at AirBrain by Kevin McCarthy who shot off his
[2:57:56.160 --> 2:58:02.160]  mouth about the Benghazi Committee, which wasn't correct anyway because the FBI is going after
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:09.600]  Hillary on the basis of crimes committed. So I would not be worried, sir, and I would not be
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:14.640]  worried in terms of the guns that are taken away or the veterans. If, in fact, they want to touch
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:19.120]  the VA, they're going to have to do a lot more than they've done. Unfortunately, they've never
[2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:24.560]  picked an individual who could run the veteran administration. This new man who came out of
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.960]  West Point never really was in combat, but what worked for Palm Olive or whatever,
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:33.520]  Transnational Corporation, is not effective. All right, stay there. You've got to go to
[2:58:33.520 --> 2:58:37.520]  the right. Fourth hour. Stay there. Fourth hour coming up in five minutes with us,
[2:58:37.520 --> 2:58:44.720]  and we'll hand the baton to David Knight. Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones. Visit gcmlive.com today.

[2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:26.160]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of brain

[2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:55.600]  So,
[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:04.960]  Fix Bayonets folks, it's overdrive.
[3:00:10.880 --> 3:00:18.320]  Fix Bayonets, we are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:23.760]  from the front lines. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:34.240]  Final segment with Dr. Steve Pochett. I'd love to have him back up sooner. What amazing last 45
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:40.640]  minutes or so or hour with him getting into the what's happening here in the world. I'll tell
[3:00:40.640 --> 3:00:44.640]  you this, everything the establishment's doing is blowing up in their face. Like I've never seen
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:48.960]  it before, the house of cards is coming down, but what a dangerous time to be alive. Tom in
[3:00:48.960 --> 3:00:55.040]  Tennessee, you got a question or a comment? Go ahead. Hey, Alex. I was calling him to
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:00.880]  talk to Joel Scales and that's a second. No, you want to hold that long. I understand. We're
[3:01:00.880 --> 3:01:08.000]  not screening your call. You're on air. Russia, back when Obama was speaking with Putin,
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:16.640]  and it caught him saying he'd have more power to second term. Do you think he was now maybe
[3:01:16.640 --> 3:01:23.760]  discussing Syria? Sure. That's a good question for Pochett. Obviously, there's more behind the
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:28.000]  scenes diplomatic stuff with Russia. But what was Obama talking about when he told Putin,
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:32.000]  I'll be able or was vignette. Yeah, I believe I'm even Putin. I'll be able to do more once I'm
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:40.880]  reelected. That was back prior to 2008 or excuse me, the last election, 2012. What do you think
[3:01:40.880 --> 3:01:46.880]  that was really about, Dr. Pochett? Well, let's understand this. Russia has never really been
[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:52.080]  our enemy. Yeah. Although I've been involved in the regime change in the Soviet Union, I made it
[3:01:52.080 --> 3:01:57.760]  very clear to all of our officials that we didn't do anything to take down Russia. Russia has been
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:03.840]  a formidable ally of ours. It has always worked with us. And in fact, it has a much more serious
[3:02:03.840 --> 3:02:10.560]  problem of Islamic terrorism because of Central Asia. And Russia has 83 different countries
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:16.560]  literally within its time frame, which is 11 time zones as opposed to four time zones for the United
[3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:22.880]  States. So Obama has worked with Russia because in turn we work with Iran. And Iran has been
[3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:28.800]  helpful to us in our military. What has not been told by the neocons and these hysterical
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:36.080]  anti-Iranian individuals is the fact that Iran repeatedly helped us, our soldiers, to evacuate
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:42.480]  from Iraq and from Afghanistan, not once but twice. And now they're willing to take on the
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:49.280]  hard work of defeating the very institutions we created, namely ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Sunnis.
[3:02:49.280 --> 3:02:55.040]  So Iran, Russia, and the United States are still the formidable powers of the Middle East.
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:59.920]  What will happen is that Turkey has to come in and to represent the Sunnis, and that depends on
[3:02:59.920 --> 3:03:06.160]  Erdogan. If Erdogan works with us, that's fine. If he doesn't work with us, he will be displaced
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:11.040]  and someone else will come in. But in fact, the Middle East has been reassigned. The United
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:16.320]  States was involved in it. It's a very conscious decision. There's nothing to do with communism
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:21.520]  or anything to do with anything else other than the fact we're neutralizing all the major
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:27.760]  Saudis and the extreme Islamists. And that was planned for quite a time, and I was for it.
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:33.520]  And I still believe strongly that Saudi Arabia has to be taken down. They've supported terrorism
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:38.640]  for too long. The Saudi kings and princes are not effective in ruling their country. The young
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:44.240]  people have to be in charge. And in fact, we don't belong in the Middle East. Our biggest problem will
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:50.000]  be, for us economically and politically, will be China. And that doesn't mean China is our enemy.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:55.120]  It simply means that Trump said that China is taking advantage of the financial system,
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:04:00.240]  but it has a much bigger internal problem, which we have to watch. And that is China
[3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:06.960]  financially cannot handle its own country. It has 1.3 billion in President Xi Jinping,
[3:04:06.960 --> 3:04:12.480]  who's still more of a communist than he is a capitalist, has no idea whatsoever of how to
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:19.520]  really run an economic unit, even within communism. So the devaluation of the currency and the fact
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:25.440]  that China is in deflationary mode is a far more serious problem for the world and for our national
[3:04:25.440 --> 3:04:31.440]  security than any other particular... Sure. I mean, economic forecast just is a very, very
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:37.600]  foggy, but at the same time treacherous road we're on. Correct. StevePochennick.com.
[3:04:38.240 --> 3:04:41.680]  Check out his latest book there. It's nonfiction. Steve Pochennick, thank you for joining us,
[3:04:41.680 --> 3:04:46.080]  talk. It's a pleasure, Alex. Always a pleasure to have you on. Look, the fourth hour, the full
[3:04:46.080 --> 3:04:51.200]  fourth hour is coming up. Maya and others, if you want to hold, I'm sure David Knight will get to
[3:04:51.200 --> 3:04:56.400]  you somewhere in that time. If not, I'll see you back tomorrow, 11 a.m. Central, Nightly News tonight, 7.
[3:04:58.480 --> 3:05:04.880]  A U.S. high school student has reportedly hacked a personal AOL account of CIA director John Brennan.
[3:05:04.880 --> 3:05:10.720]  According to the hacker, everything from a 47-page application for top secret security clearance
[3:05:10.720 --> 3:05:15.680]  to details of the agency's harsh interrogation techniques were discovered in the breach,
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:21.760]  notes the New York Post. The October 12 intrusion began after the hacker was able to trick workers
[3:05:21.760 --> 3:05:27.360]  at Verizon into providing Brennan's personal information and duping AOL into resetting his
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:32.640]  password. Law enforcement sources speaking with the Post were shocked at the hacker's actions,
[3:05:32.640 --> 3:05:37.360]  noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example of the hackers if possible.
[3:05:37.360 --> 3:05:41.680]  We've previously seen the CIA brag about how they're collecting your information,
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:46.480]  going as far as saying they could spy on you through your dishwasher. All manner of alphabet
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:50.880]  agencies can gather your information without a warrant, but if you take it from them,
[3:05:50.880 --> 3:06:14.880]  they have a problem with that. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[3:07:01.200 --> 3:07:06.160]  are true game changers. They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by
[3:07:06.160 --> 3:07:11.120]  prescription. But when we look at a product like Survival Shield, Mason iodine X2, it's something
[3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:15.680]  that really has been hiding in plain view for over 100 years. The federal government mandated
[3:07:15.680 --> 3:07:20.960]  from the 20s until the 70s that iodine accrued form of it be added to table salt because of the
[3:07:20.960 --> 3:07:25.760]  incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing. I want to challenge the
[3:07:25.760 --> 3:07:30.400]  listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves. What do you have to lose? You are the tip of the
[3:07:30.400 --> 3:07:34.960]  spear in the fight for human liberty, and you're getting a high-quality product that has absolutely
[3:07:34.960 --> 3:07:39.600]  changed my life and many other people's lives that I know. And the final reason to try X2 is
[3:07:39.600 --> 3:07:43.760]  that it's so hard to keep in stock. We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago,
[3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:48.560]  and that is about to sell out. It may be a month or two until more comes in. I want to challenge
[3:07:48.560 --> 3:07:53.920]  all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com
[3:07:53.920 --> 3:08:21.920]  or by calling 888-253-3139. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on this fourth hour. This is Tuesday, October 20th, 2015, and I'm David Knight. We're going to go over some news, and there's a lot of news that is broken. Of course, one of the most amazing pieces of news, I think, is
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:41.920]  this Ebola relapse, which we haven't really talked about that much. I covered it last night. We have a clip from the nightly news, Ebola relapse, zombie virus that won't die. That's essentially what's going on with this. There's been a cavalier attitude that we saw when this broke out in the United States with government officials.
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:09:00.920]  Let's not worry. We know everything about how to control this, and they were very careless in many people's opinions about how they did quarantine, flaunting the fact that they didn't need to do quarantine. We saw a doctor that had said in the past, shut up and take your damn vaccine.
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:14.920]  That same doctor had been exposed to someone with Ebola, and she and her news crew were supposed to be quarantined, but she violated that quarantine, was seen walking around. So we saw all kinds of cavalier attitudes toward this. Now, here's what's going on with this.
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:29.920]  We've seen an Ebola relapse of a doctor, a British nurse, I should say, Pauline Kafferke. She was given the all-clear back in January of this year. So here we are nine months later. At the end of last week, she was in critical condition. She almost died.
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:45.920]  Thankfully, she is now recovering. She's still in serious but guarded condition, I think is the way they term it in the UK. Nevertheless, as the Guardian points out, doctors and scientists are amazed and appalled at the Scottish nurses' relapse.
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:57.920]  What is the bottom line for all this? Well, the bottom line is that we need to understand that science is never settled. When you hear them say that they don't need your informed consent because they know everything about the new vaccines that have just come on the market,
[3:09:57.920 --> 3:10:06.920]  they know about the interaction between all the vaccines and they know that it isn't going to be a safety issue or an efficacy issue. That is total bunk.
[3:10:06.920 --> 3:10:16.920]  It's total bunk. How many times in the history of science have we seen what was conventional wisdom completely overturned as time went on?
[3:10:16.920 --> 3:10:28.920]  Whether it's the orbits of the planets or whatever, we see this coming out. There's a consensus and everybody is demonized if they go against that consensus. But that's where you find the breakthroughs.
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:39.920]  It's the independent thinkers. It's the skeptics. Those are the people that are constantly being shut down. And of course, we have the right to be informed. We have the right to have our consent sought.
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:46.920]  And so when we look at a situation like this, and let me just, I'm going to go to the callers who've been waiting for a long time. I know Maya in Kansas has been waiting for quite a while.
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:54.920]  I want to go to you in just a moment. But let me first do this Ebola thing and then I'll go right to Maya in Kansas because this is important for everybody to understand.
[3:10:54.920 --> 3:11:01.920]  They say when they go through and they give somebody an all clear, they look at things like the blood and the saliva and organs like the liver.
[3:11:01.920 --> 3:11:11.920]  They find that they're free of the Ebola virus. But what they have now learned is that there's pockets in the body where the immune system doesn't go after Ebola.
[3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:22.920]  And these are places like the brain, the eye, the sexual organs. And so you have a situation that we just saw not too long ago, an American doctor Ian Crozier.
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:30.920]  He'd been working in Sierra Leone. He contracted Ebola in September of last year. He was cured and then they found it in his eye.
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:35.920]  It changed his eye from blue to green. It was an inflammatory eye disease. It was caused by Ebola.
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:49.920]  On the same day that we learned about this nurse who was in critical condition, the same New England Journal of Medicine that had given us the information about Ian Crozier, the doctor that had the eye inflammation,
[3:11:49.920 --> 3:11:54.920]  told us that they had found a very well documented case of sexual transmission.
[3:11:54.920 --> 3:12:02.920]  This happened seven months after a man had been cleared. He transmitted it to his sexual partner. She died from Ebola.
[3:12:02.920 --> 3:12:07.920]  And it was the people who were trying to backtrack it. That's why it took so long.
[3:12:07.920 --> 3:12:13.920]  So we were told at first, oh, don't worry, it's seven weeks and then people are clear. They won't sexually transmit it.
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:19.920]  Then we were told it's seven months. Now they're saying to be safe that it's nine months. Who knows, really?
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:30.920]  They're saying that it can hide out in a lot of different places. It can hide out in the prostrate gland and amniotic fluid and the placenta and breast milk and in the central nervous system, the brain.
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:37.920]  And they give a story about a couple of monkeys who had a relapse, who had been cured and had a relapse of Ebola.
[3:12:37.920 --> 3:12:45.920]  They put those monkeys down, but they said they were very, very seriously ill. So we hope that this works out for this nurse who appears to be recovering.
[3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:53.920]  But of course, it brings up the issue of the entire Ebola outbreak. There are thousands of people who are pronounced cured.
[3:12:53.920 --> 3:13:02.920]  And yet, we don't know how they're still harboring the Ebola virus and if that can break out yet again.
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:09.920]  So as we talk about that, let's take Maya's call. Maya, in Kansas, you had a question about prepping for the collapse and relocation.
[3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:15.920]  I'm sure you wanted to ask Joel Scouse on that, and I'm not sure if I can help you on it, but go ahead and ask your question or give us your comment.
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:25.920]  Well, actually, what I'd like to do is switch, if I may, based on what you've just spoken about, because I ran a healthcare organization for 10 years.
[3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:31.920]  And the organization I ran was called the viral hepatitis HIV outreach.
[3:13:31.920 --> 3:13:40.920]  And so I know, I guess the best way I can say this is straight out.
[3:13:40.920 --> 3:13:50.920]  We've been lied to the whole time about this because it has nothing to do with Ebola. It's about viruses. Okay. Hepatitis is a virus.
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:14:00.920]  HIV is a virus. If you talk to any doctor or nurse for more than 10 minutes about viruses, they will tell you that they don't just disappear.
[3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:05.920]  That's why shingles is here.
[3:14:05.920 --> 3:14:15.920]  Even when one of the things that we know now is that when you treat someone for viral hepatitis or HIV, you don't really destroy the virus.
[3:14:15.920 --> 3:14:23.920]  What you do is you clear the virus from the person's body, but there is still residue there.
[3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:31.920]  And so when you're talking about these things hiding in different areas, the eye, the brain, this is common knowledge.
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:43.920]  So I know for a fact that there were people who listened as the CDC said, we've taken care of it. The person can go home.
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:53.920]  There are medical personnel. I know who saw that and said what I'm pretty much saying now, BS.
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:58.920]  That's very true. And a good point when you're talking about things like herpes and things like shingles.
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:08.920]  And the key thing here, which I think is everybody is frightening as the Ebola virus itself is just how we were lied to and manipulated by the government, by the CDC especially.
[3:15:08.920 --> 3:15:17.920]  Absolutely. And I've actually worked with different people within the CDC in order to put on these conferences.
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:31.920]  So I am not a medical person. I'm a healthcare educator, which kind of gives me an edge because I get to hear all of this and I get to take it and explain it to other people.
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:39.920]  So the whole idea of Ebola just disappearing from the body is ridiculous.
[3:15:39.920 --> 3:15:50.920]  Think about a man wearing a gray hat. You go over there and you go there to treat that man wearing the gray hat.
[3:15:50.920 --> 3:15:59.920]  But guess what? The moment you administer whatever it is to treat, the hat changes colors. It mutates.
[3:15:59.920 --> 3:16:07.920]  It becomes different. And that's what the real fight with viruses is all about, trying to catch it before it mutates.
[3:16:07.920 --> 3:16:17.920]  Now, if you take a look at what HIV and hepatitis will do, imagine where Ebola could be hiding.
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:30.920]  Certainly, we've already seen the many careless releases, the many malfunctions that they've had at CDC laboratories.
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:37.920]  We had the situation at Tulane University at their national primate center where they had a disease that had brought in to weaponize because that's what our government is doing.
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:48.920]  But when they lied to us about this, and when we know that they have a program where they bring in deadly diseases to make them more deadly, to make them more easily transmissible,
[3:16:48.920 --> 3:16:58.920]  and when we see all of the accidents, whether they're real accidents or whether it's something that they plan to do, that are happening with a Pentagon, with a CDC, at the primate center in Tulane,
[3:16:58.920 --> 3:17:06.920]  where they let out Burkholderia, Pseudomalia, a disease that got out of the biosafety level 3 lab, that's what really should concern us.
[3:17:06.920 --> 3:17:11.920]  We have a government that not only lies to us, but is weaponizing diseases.
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:17.920]  That's my biggest concern about this, and that was what we were concerned about when we saw this cavalier attitude surrounding Ebola.
[3:17:17.920 --> 3:17:23.920]  But of course, we've seen that cavalier attitude at the CDC's own biosafety labs.
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:30.920]  And also consider this, and I don't know this for a fact, but this is how you need to think about it.
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:44.920]  When you see a number of different viruses or accidents taking place throughout the United States, like there were bios found in old buildings that had been filled with poison or substance.
[3:17:44.920 --> 3:17:47.920]  I can't remember what it was last year.
[3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:51.920]  They had found it in a box in an abandoned building.
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:17:59.920]  You've got to start asking yourself, what is going on that three and four different kinds of viruses and or bacteria
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:03.920]  are being exposed in the environment?
[3:18:03.920 --> 3:18:05.920]  Three or four different.
[3:18:05.920 --> 3:18:07.920]  How do they intermingle?
[3:18:07.920 --> 3:18:11.920]  Is there a threat if these two should get together?
[3:18:11.920 --> 3:18:18.920]  There may not be nothing to what I just said, but you have to admit it's kind of weird that we're dealing with MRSA.
[3:18:18.920 --> 3:18:23.920]  We're dealing with Ebola.
[3:18:23.920 --> 3:18:31.920]  I'm predicting that we're going to get hit with a virus in the future that we thought was gone a long time ago.
[3:18:31.920 --> 3:18:39.920]  We keep seeing smallpox being reintroduced into conversations and dialogue.
[3:18:39.920 --> 3:18:43.920]  And it's time that people start recognizing that.
[3:18:43.920 --> 3:18:50.920]  And as a prepper, someone who's trying to prep, I would say that if you do understand what's going on,
[3:18:50.920 --> 3:18:53.920]  you should be taking care of yourself now.
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:19:02.920]  Do your doctor, do your dentist, do your optometrist, do all of these people because by next year,
[3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:07.920]  you're not going to be able to get in without filling out a lot of information.
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:15.920]  You're going to have to start questioning the equipment and the tools that these people are using right now.
[3:19:15.920 --> 3:19:22.920]  The viral hepatitis was one where hepatitis C and hepatitis B.
[3:19:22.920 --> 3:19:29.920]  People were saying, how do you get that? Well, guess what? Very easily. It's a blood transfer.
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:37.920]  And if you imagine the head of a pin, the hepatitis C virus is smaller than that.
[3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:48.920]  We're out of time, Maya. Yes, very good points that you made. And certainly, we have to be just as concerned about what our CDC is doing as Sierra Leone was concerned about what Tulane University was doing in their country.
[3:19:48.920 --> 3:19:56.920]  That was the site where Ebola began. And they asked, as you're doing these experiments here, and it begins right here, was it an accident or was it deliberate?
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:19:59.920]  They threw them out. We need to do the same thing about these programs.

[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:24.920]  I just want to let you know that you can get 10% off of Infowars Select Foods right now and get free shipping. If you get a one-year food supply, that'll work out to about a $300 savings.
[3:24:24.920 --> 3:24:29.920]  That's huge because shipping is a big part of the expense when you order food, of course, because it's heavy.
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:36.920]  These are foods that are made in the United States. They're made and packaged, and that packaging is one of the things that makes them so important.
[3:24:36.920 --> 3:24:46.920]  It's military spec packaging, and you also have Ziploc packaging in it so that once you open it, you can reseal it and reuse it, but it will last for 25 years.
[3:24:46.920 --> 3:24:55.920]  Again, you can get that at infowarsstore.com. It's something that we have in stock. This is a special that has been running for a while.

[3:25:17.920 --> 3:25:28.920]  It's almost as popular as Star Wars tickets. They started selling Star Wars tickets two months before it's going to come out, and they crashed the systems on Star Wars.
[3:25:28.920 --> 3:25:34.920]  We sell out of supermail vitality pretty quickly, too. Here's your opportunity to get some.
[3:25:34.920 --> 3:25:39.920]  I want to go to Paul in New Mexico. You had a comment about black sites. Go ahead.
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:46.920]  Yeah, really. I got like three analogies if I could real quick and maybe a statement.
[3:25:46.920 --> 3:26:03.920]  On the vaccine analogy, if this was the Olympics, the elite, the top 1,000 of percenters would be going for the gold as they get the gold level benefits while the lower 99.99% of humanity is treated to the bronze level membership.
[3:26:03.920 --> 3:26:14.920]  The top 1,000 of percenters get the clean vaccines, but the lower 99.9%ers get the dirty vaccines.
[3:26:14.920 --> 3:26:28.920]  Second analogy real quick here is on the gun, Beaver the Cleaver from the TV show Leave It to Beaver, not the meat cleaver, is to blame for the shame he inflicts on his family name.
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:37.920]  Beaver the Cleaver is not to blame, but the meat cleaver for the physical violence and harm he inflicts on his victims.
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:50.920]  Now, on the third analogy, the movie Tom Cruise and Robert De Niro and Nicole Kidman, and the final race, Duvall says the Tom Cruise, you can drive through it.
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:54.920]  I know it in my heart. You can drive through it.
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:27:03.920]  So that's an analogy with humanity. Will they be able to make it through? Will we be able to make it through the wreckage that the globalists cause?
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:08.920]  Well, that's a good point. I want to take a look in the next segment when we come back, Paul.
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:12.920]  I want to take a look at what's going on with the Internet because there's a couple of different aspects of this.
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:20.920]  There's a great article that Drudge linked to about Ted Cruz talking about the threat to free speech, to Internet freedom.
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:25.920]  And I want to break down what's really behind that because there's a couple of different aspects to it.
[3:27:25.920 --> 3:27:30.920]  And I think when you're talking about breaking through this, we have to understand what we're facing.
[3:27:30.920 --> 3:27:32.920]  And there's a couple of different aspects to this.
[3:27:32.920 --> 3:27:37.920]  Number one, we have these Byzantine bureaucracies that are expanding their empires.
[3:27:37.920 --> 3:27:40.920]  And the FCC is just one of those. We've got many of them.
[3:27:40.920 --> 3:27:43.920]  And then we also have the military industrial complex.
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:46.920]  And I want to look at the origins of the Internet.
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:51.920]  I'm not talking about Al Gore here. He had absolutely nothing to do with it.
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:55.920]  But we're going to take a look at the real origins of the Internet
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:28:01.920]  and the origins of many of the computer issues that we're now facing in terms of artificial intelligence,
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:06.920]  in terms of pre-crime, in terms of spying and manipulating on the population.
[3:28:06.920 --> 3:28:11.920]  Where did these all come from? We can trace them all back to one DARPA scientist.
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:16.920]  And we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about the intergalactic computer network.
[3:28:16.920 --> 3:28:19.920]  That's what he called the Internet when he first created it, when he first invented it.
[3:28:19.920 --> 3:28:22.920]  We're going to tell you who that is. We're going to tell you what's behind that.
[3:28:22.920 --> 3:28:25.920]  And we're going to talk about how those things are coming together.
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:30.920]  Thanks, Paul, for this. I want to hit on some news real quickly before we go to this break as well.
[3:28:30.920 --> 3:28:35.920]  We have Joe Biden, who looked like last week the entire Democrat Party,
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:39.920]  as well as mainstream media was piling on Joe and telling him not to run.
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:43.920]  Many of us believe that he was going to announce right after the debate,
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:46.920]  or maybe even during the debate, or right before the debate.
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:50.920]  CNN even had their own podium there, waiting for Joe begging him to come on,
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:53.920]  because they, I think, knew it was going to be a snoozefest.
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:57.920]  They knew they weren't going to ask any challenging questions to anybody.
[3:28:57.920 --> 3:29:01.920]  And perhaps if Joe Biden gets in, he might truly challenge Clinton.
[3:29:01.920 --> 3:29:04.920]  None of the people who were on the stage bothered to do that.
[3:29:04.920 --> 3:29:08.920]  Looked like most of them were auditioning for Vice Presidential candidacy.
[3:29:08.920 --> 3:29:12.920]  We now have Webb, who has dropped out of the race,
[3:29:12.920 --> 3:29:17.920]  and says that he's exploring an independent possibility he might run as an independent.
[3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:19.920]  But Joe Biden has now come back.
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:23.920]  And Joe Biden came out with a very interesting statement this weekend,
[3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:27.920]  where he contradicted Clinton's account of the Osama bin Laden raid.
[3:29:27.920 --> 3:29:30.920]  And we're going to talk about what he had to say about that,
[3:29:30.920 --> 3:29:32.920]  because I think it's very interesting.
[3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:36.920]  If you can get people to believe that Osama bin Laden was still alive
[3:29:36.920 --> 3:29:40.920]  and Obama killed him, I guess they can believe any version of the story.
[3:29:40.920 --> 3:29:43.920]  Hillary Clinton's version, Joe Biden's version,
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:46.920]  or maybe a new version that they'll come up between the two of them.
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:30:07.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:36.920]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:30:36.920 --> 3:30:38.920]  And again, journalists have interviewed the rebels in Syria,
[3:30:38.920 --> 3:30:42.920]  and almost all of them admitted they have pledged allegiance to these radical Islamic groups.
[3:30:42.920 --> 3:30:44.920]  According to journalist Ben Reynolds,
[3:30:44.920 --> 3:30:46.920]  there's simply no real separation between moderate rebel groups
[3:30:46.920 --> 3:30:49.920]  and hardline Salafists allied with al-Qaeda.
[3:30:49.920 --> 3:30:53.920]  So in other words, Hillary thinks that the Second Amendment only applies to al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:56.920]  Once again, this is Kit Daniels with info-worse.com,
[3:30:56.920 --> 3:30:58.920]  and keep checking back for more reports.
[3:30:58.920 --> 3:31:07.920]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[3:31:07.920 --> 3:31:10.920]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[3:31:10.920 --> 3:31:13.920]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:17.920]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it,
[3:31:17.920 --> 3:31:20.920]  young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[3:31:20.920 --> 3:31:23.920]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[3:31:23.920 --> 3:31:28.920]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[3:31:28.920 --> 3:31:32.920]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[3:31:32.920 --> 3:31:34.920]  that children would actually like and take.
[3:31:34.920 --> 3:31:37.920]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements
[3:31:37.920 --> 3:31:42.920]  that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there,
[3:31:42.920 --> 3:31:47.920]  introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm
[3:31:47.920 --> 3:31:49.920]  and essential nutrients that taste great.

[3:32:58.920 --> 3:33:00.920]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[3:33:00.920 --> 3:33:02.920]  Canada is a good example.
[3:33:02.920 --> 3:33:05.920]  The UK is a good example. Why?
[3:33:05.920 --> 3:33:07.920]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:13.920]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say Obama politicized this issue.
[3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:16.920]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:19.920]  I'm not going to carry a gun. I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:27.920]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban,
[3:33:27.920 --> 3:33:32.920]  picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:40.920]  Go ahead. Make my day.
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:44.920]  To the notion that gun laws don't work, it's not worn out by the evidence.
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:50.920]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[3:33:50.920 --> 3:33:59.920]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Cory, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[3:33:59.920 --> 3:34:04.920]  We'll make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals to still get their guns.
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:12.920]  In many cases, the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:19.920]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their families from violence.
[3:34:19.920 --> 3:34:27.920]  There are people at high levels in this government who have bodyguards, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:30.920]  The average American does not have that.
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:36.920]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:38.920]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[3:34:38.920 --> 3:34:41.920]  Every day, every school at every level.
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:47.920]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[3:34:47.920 --> 3:34:54.920]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:35:03.920]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist? When a 5-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles,
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:06.920]  the school called it a terrorist threat.
[3:35:06.920 --> 3:35:10.920]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:14.920]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:18.920]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[3:35:18.920 --> 3:35:22.920]  We don't need the ability to arm assess against the army or the police.
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:25.920]  What kind of a situation in the U.S. would you see that happening?
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:29.920]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitution lists and a lot of people that it's stockpiled with.
[3:35:29.920 --> 3:35:35.920]  Governor, this heard you would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:43.920]  To say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down if you want us, come and take us.
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:53.920]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[3:36:00.920 --> 3:36:08.920]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host and you just heard that intro talking about gun control.
[3:36:08.920 --> 3:36:11.920]  Actually, I think they're going to focus on ammunition control.
[3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:14.920]  We've been seeing this from the very beginning of the Obama administration.
[3:36:14.920 --> 3:36:19.920]  That is the smart play on their side and they've been working towards that from the get-go.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:22.920]  And of course, we now have the latest evidence of this.
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:24.920]  This article that we have up on infowars.com today.
[3:36:24.920 --> 3:36:25.920]  There will be blood.
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:28.920]  A socialist professor says America's gun owners should be shot.
[3:36:28.920 --> 3:36:31.920]  He says it's very simple as a condition of getting a gun get shot.
[3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:37.920]  Well, he's not really serious about that, but he is serious in terms of talking about controlling ammunition.
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:40.920]  I think that's one of the key things to take away from this story.
[3:36:40.920 --> 3:36:47.920]  He begins with a joke from Chris Rock saying, hey, let's make the price of bullets $5,000 each.
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:52.920]  That means that if you really want to pump 10 bullets into somebody, you're going to have to part with $50,000.
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:37:02.920]  Now, they're going to try to outlaw ammunition, whether it's by making it scarce as they did with the massive purchases of Homeland Security.
[3:37:02.920 --> 3:37:04.920]  Remember when ammunition disappeared?
[3:37:04.920 --> 3:37:12.920]  It just so happened that we knew that Homeland Security had all these private contracts to buy it up out of the marketplace.
[3:37:12.920 --> 3:37:14.920]  The military makes their own bullets.
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:21.920]  And of course, at the beginning of the Obama administration, we had a policy put in place by Obama that they would have the military,
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:27.920]  instead of recycling and selling their spent brass, which would make money for the military, but they don't need to worry about money.
[3:37:27.920 --> 3:37:29.920]  They've got unlimited supplies, right?
[3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:36.920]  So instead of recycling it, they were going to crush it into worthless, near-worthless copper.
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:46.920]  Spend the money to recycle it so that you can sell it at something that is much less valuable so that you can keep that out of the hands of the population.
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:48.920]  Some senators pushed back on that.
[3:37:48.920 --> 3:37:57.920]  We found out just a couple of years ago, however, that there are still some military bases that are still crushing their brass rather than recycling it as they're supposed to do.
[3:37:57.920 --> 3:38:08.920]  So if they want to go in and make ammunition prohibitively expensive, difficult legally to purchase because of background checks or whatever games that they want to play,
[3:38:08.920 --> 3:38:11.920]  that's the way they can do gun confiscation.
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:14.920]  Yes, we know registration precedes confiscation.
[3:38:14.920 --> 3:38:22.920]  But if you don't have bullets, you're going to be like Davy Crockett at the Alamo when you shot all of your muzzle-loading ammunition.
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:25.920]  You're going to be using it as a club because that's all you're going to have.
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:34.920]  That is the smart play, but it is also the unconstitutional, unlawful play because we know that it is the right to keep and bear arms.
[3:38:34.920 --> 3:38:36.920]  That is a fundamental right.
[3:38:36.920 --> 3:38:38.920]  It is protected by the Constitution.
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:48.920]  But just because we have explicit protections in the Constitution or explicit prohibitions in the Constitution by the government, they violate that every day.
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:53.920]  Don't count on the Constitution to protect you from the crooks and liars that we have in Washington.
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:57.920]  And I want to talk about that specifically in terms of the First Amendment.
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:01.920]  We have an article that came out today.
[3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:06.920]  This is something that was on the Dredge Report, the Blaze interviewed Ted Cruz over the weekend.
[3:39:06.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  And he was talking about internet freedom threats to the Dredge Report, as Dredge has been very concerned about.
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:20.920]  As Dredge talked about when he came here to Infowars, Ted Cruz said on Sunday evening that threats to internet freedom have never been greater
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:28.920]  and could have the potential of affecting independent online news outlets like the Dredge Report, like all independent news outlets.
[3:39:28.920 --> 3:39:30.920]  That's what it's really targeted toward.
[3:39:30.920 --> 3:39:33.920]  He said, I think threats to internet freedom continue to grow, said Ted Cruz.
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:37.920]  He said, this administration views the internet as a threat.
[3:39:37.920 --> 3:39:43.920]  Well, I'm going to explain to you how it was really designed as a tool of control.
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:46.920]  It was designed by DARPA to control us.
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:50.920]  It was designed to identify and neutralize threats.
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:52.920]  We talk about pre-crime.
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:40:01.920]  We talk about the government looking at everything we do, activity-based intelligence, geospatial intelligence, human domain analytics to master the human domain.
[3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:04.920]  When we talk about all this, this is nothing that is new.
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:08.920]  This is something that goes back to the inception of the internet.
[3:40:08.920 --> 3:40:12.920]  Let me read you some of the other things that Ted Cruz said, though, because there's multiple aspects to this.
[3:40:12.920 --> 3:40:16.920]  There's not just a technological military aspect to it.
[3:40:16.920 --> 3:40:19.920]  There's also a bureaucratic aspect to it.
[3:40:19.920 --> 3:40:28.920]  The Texas Senator cited the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC's move, to classify broadband internet service as a public utility as evidence of the threat.
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:38.920]  He says, I've worked to do in the Senate every day to fight to defend the freedom of the internet, to keep the internet free from the grubby hands of regulators and government,
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:43.920]  to keep it free from taxes, to allow free speech and entrepreneurship to flourish.
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:53.920]  And I think liberty on the net is every day more and more imperiled by big government and by Washington politicians who want to muzzle dissent.
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:41:03.920]  He went on to say, you know, the Obama FCC has invoked the fairness doctrine a number of times with a sort of wistful glances to the past, a kind of nostalgia, he said.
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:11.920]  You know, if I had suggested years ago that the Obama administration would send government observers into the newsrooms of major media organizations,
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:17.920]  that claim would have been ridiculed, yet that's exactly what the FCC proposed to do.
[3:41:17.920 --> 3:41:26.920]  Because, you see, what began as a bureaucracy that they said they were going to allocate the frequencies to keep things in order,
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:34.920]  essentially kind of like a land rush like they had in Oklahoma where they were going to allocate the frequencies and then protect that as private property.
[3:41:34.920 --> 3:41:42.920]  Instead, what they did was they started to regulate speech. That was what the fairness doctrine was. That was an unconstitutional violation of that.
[3:41:42.920 --> 3:41:47.920]  But what we need to do is we need to understand if we're going to counteract this.
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:55.920]  We need to understand where these threats come from. We need to understand that this is not something that is coming necessarily just from Obama.
[3:41:55.920 --> 3:42:04.920]  Okay, that's where the big danger lies. When they politicize this, like Ted Cruz does, and says this is simply Obama, that is a problem.
[3:42:04.920 --> 3:42:10.920]  Because this is a problem that has gone on throughout every regime that we've had lately.
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:14.920]  And this is something that goes back for many, many decades to the military-industrial complex.
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:22.920]  And if we don't understand the nature of the threat, if we personalize it and say that it's going to be solved if we get Obama out,
[3:42:22.920 --> 3:42:29.920]  then we are truly in danger because we have been blinded by partisanship to the true source of the cause.
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:34.920]  That's what I want to talk to you about today. There's essentially two main threats to the Internet.
[3:42:34.920 --> 3:42:40.920]  One of them is the bureaucracy. The other one is military-industrial complex, DARPA.
[3:42:40.920 --> 3:42:48.920]  Let's talk about the bureaucracy first. We've got these organizations, as we just mentioned, the FCC trying to expand its turf just like the BLM,
[3:42:48.920 --> 3:42:52.920]  just like the EPA, et cetera, et cetera. As a matter of fact, there ought to be, maybe that's what they ought to do,
[3:42:52.920 --> 3:42:58.920]  just ought to call the next new bureaucracy the ETC, because it's just et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:42:58.920 --> 3:43:02.920]  Down the line, doing the same thing over and over again. What do they do?
[3:43:02.920 --> 3:43:06.920]  These are Byzantine bureaucracies that are trying to build their little empires.
[3:43:06.920 --> 3:43:12.920]  And the way they do it is they come in and they assert control over something, just as we're seeing the FCC do right now.
[3:43:12.920 --> 3:43:22.920]  Then they come in and they write their own laws, not our elected representatives, but these permanently entrenched bureaucracies that will remain there when Obama goes.
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:27.920]  They were there when the Republicans were in charge. They were there when Ronald Reagan was in charge and he didn't take them out.
[3:43:27.920 --> 3:43:34.920]  Remember he was going to take out the Department of Education? That was this new Rosemary baby that was still gurgling in the crib.
[3:43:34.920 --> 3:43:40.920]  He could have killed it. Instead, it was several times bigger when Reagan left office than when he went into office.
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:45.920]  This is the threat that we're seeing, these Byzantine empire building bureaucracies.
[3:43:45.920 --> 3:43:48.920]  And as I said, they write their own laws. Congress doesn't want to write the laws.
[3:43:48.920 --> 3:43:51.920]  They don't want to take the blame for what's really going down.
[3:43:51.920 --> 3:43:56.920]  So they create these bureaucracies, let the bureaucracies write the laws, let the bureaucracies take the blame.
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:44:02.920]  And so what we're faced with, the American people, is legislation without representation.
[3:44:02.920 --> 3:44:06.920]  Ah, but there's also taxation without representation as well.
[3:44:06.920 --> 3:44:11.920]  Because what they do is they not only write their laws, but they come up with the fines and the penalties.
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:17.920]  And then they have their own police departments that they're now starting to arm with military equipment.
[3:44:17.920 --> 3:44:22.920]  They have their own police departments to police and to fine you with these.
[3:44:22.920 --> 3:44:27.920]  And guess what? When they accuse you of something, you don't get your due process.
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:33.920]  Because even though it's the government coming after you saying that you've committed a crime, they say, no, this is a civil action.
[3:44:33.920 --> 3:44:38.920]  So you don't get a jury trial. You don't get the presumption of innocence.
[3:44:38.920 --> 3:44:41.920]  They come after you in a civil action.
[3:44:41.920 --> 3:44:46.920]  So that's where we are. No due process. They have completely overthrown the rule of law.
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:50.920]  They have completely overthrown all of our rights.
[3:44:50.920 --> 3:44:52.920]  It's nothing new.
[3:44:52.920 --> 3:44:56.920]  When we had the Declaration of Independence, remember Thomas Jefferson's phrase,
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:03.920]  they have created swarms of officers to harass our people, to eat out their substance.
[3:45:03.920 --> 3:45:07.920]  Is there any better description for the federal bureaucracy than that?
[3:45:07.920 --> 3:45:15.920]  Do you think that you're going to elect somebody as a Republican or Democrat who is going to stop this as president?
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:18.920]  This goes on regardless of who is president.
[3:45:18.920 --> 3:45:25.920]  And unless we understand the origin of the threat, unless we understand the nature of what we are fighting,
[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:32.920]  these permanently entrenched bureaucracies that are building their empires that are operating independent of us,
[3:45:32.920 --> 3:45:38.920]  unaccountable to us, unless we understand that, we will never be able to take the appropriate steps.
[3:45:38.920 --> 3:45:42.920]  We don't need a constitutional convention. We don't need a new constitution.
[3:45:42.920 --> 3:45:48.920]  We have the authority right now to address this problem at the state level, at the local level, at the jury level.
[3:45:48.920 --> 3:45:50.920]  We can cut these people off.
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:57.920]  We can elect sheriffs in our local area. We can elect state representatives and we can elect local officials
[3:45:57.920 --> 3:46:04.920]  who will cut off this bureaucratic overreach because they have no legal constitutional basis.
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:09.920]  What they are doing, intruding themselves into the most minute details of our life,
[3:46:09.920 --> 3:46:14.920]  just as I talked about last night on the nightly news, Michelle Obama presuming on herself to dictate
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:18.920]  how all the individual schools are going to feed our children.
[3:46:18.920 --> 3:46:25.920]  What could be more absurd? What could be a more ridiculous overreach of federal power than that?
[3:46:25.920 --> 3:46:30.920]  That is absolutely insane. All we have to do is say no.
[3:46:30.920 --> 3:46:33.920]  You're not going to do it. You're not going to bribe us with it.
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:37.920]  There was a school in Montana, a school district, they were being bribed by the federal government,
[3:46:37.920 --> 3:46:43.920]  $117,000 to let Michelle Obama dictate to them the garbage that they were going to be fed.
[3:46:43.920 --> 3:46:47.920]  And they said, you know what, it just isn't working out for us even economically.
[3:46:47.920 --> 3:46:52.920]  So just from a pragmatic standpoint, the school district said, you're costing us more money than you're giving us.
[3:46:52.920 --> 3:46:57.920]  And we need to say that on many different issues at many different levels.
[3:46:57.920 --> 3:47:01.920]  So yeah, a constitutional convention isn't going to protect us from liars and thieves
[3:47:01.920 --> 3:47:07.920]  who take office swearing allegiance to a constitution that they then ignore completely.
[3:47:07.920 --> 3:47:13.920]  We have to do that at the local level and we can't be distracted by thinking that we're going to solve everything
[3:47:13.920 --> 3:47:17.920]  by putting Ted Cruz in place rather than Barack Obama.
[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:19.920]  Some things would change, yes.
[3:47:19.920 --> 3:47:25.920]  But we have to understand the nature of this problem coming after the Internet is a bureaucratic problem.
[3:47:25.920 --> 3:47:30.920]  And it is something that regardless of who gets the presidency, if we don't understand where that's coming from,
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:32.920]  we're not going to be able to address that.
[3:47:32.920 --> 3:47:34.920]  Let me talk to you about the technological tool.
[3:47:34.920 --> 3:47:37.920]  That's the political tool where they're coming after our free speech,
[3:47:37.920 --> 3:47:39.920]  where they're coming after the freedom of the Internet.
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:42.920]  Let me talk to you about the technological tool.
[3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:47.920]  Let me talk to you about the military industrial complex and specifically DARPA.
[3:47:47.920 --> 3:47:49.920]  It wasn't Al Gore that invented the Internet.
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:52.920]  It was DARPA. At the time they were called ARPA.
[3:47:52.920 --> 3:47:55.920]  Many of you might remember ARPA Net.
[3:47:55.920 --> 3:47:56.920]  That was the beginning of it.
[3:47:56.920 --> 3:48:00.920]  Many of you, however, may not remember J.C.R. Licklider.
[3:48:00.920 --> 3:48:03.920]  He was the guy who came up with a vision for the Internet.
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:06.920]  He called it the intergalactic computer network.
[3:48:06.920 --> 3:48:08.920]  Now they just call it the Internet.
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:10.920]  They cut out the galactic part.
[3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:14.920]  I guess it sounded too much like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,
[3:48:14.920 --> 3:48:16.920]  paying a like to Gargle Blaster.
[3:48:16.920 --> 3:48:20.920]  But nevertheless, this was the guy who had the vision for the Internet.
[3:48:20.920 --> 3:48:28.920]  That's interesting because this guy had a lot of visionary revelations that he came up with.
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:31.920]  We'll talk about graphical user interfaces that everybody uses today,
[3:48:31.920 --> 3:48:35.920]  the mouse, the windows, that remember you saw those first on the Macintosh?
[3:48:35.920 --> 3:48:37.920]  And of course, many people point out, no, no, no, no.
[3:48:37.920 --> 3:48:39.920]  Steve Jobs didn't come up with that idea.
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:46.920]  He got that from Xerox Park Project, P-A-R-C, the Palo Alto Research Center.
[3:48:46.920 --> 3:48:52.920]  But the head of the Xerox Park Center said, no, we got that idea from Licklider.
[3:48:52.920 --> 3:48:56.920]  He was the guy who came up with the graphical user interface.
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:48:59.920]  He was the guy who came up with the idea of the Internet.
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:05.920]  And you know, all of these things came to fruition far after this man died.
[3:49:05.920 --> 3:49:08.920]  He didn't see the Internet become what it is today.
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:11.920]  But he could see what it was going to become.
[3:49:11.920 --> 3:49:13.920]  He knew what it was going to become today.
[3:49:13.920 --> 3:49:16.920]  And he knew what the Internet was going to be tomorrow.
[3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:21.920]  And let me tell you something about his vision and about his purpose about this.
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:25.920]  Because it speaks to the mission of DARPA.
[3:49:25.920 --> 3:49:28.920]  This was a man who was not a computer scientist.
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:33.920]  A computer scientist, computer engineers didn't come about as a field for a couple of decades
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:36.920]  after he was working in the early 1960s.
[3:49:36.920 --> 3:49:38.920]  He basically created the field.
[3:49:38.920 --> 3:49:40.920]  He was a psychologist.
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:41.920]  Isn't that interesting?
[3:49:41.920 --> 3:49:43.920]  He was a psychologist.
[3:49:43.920 --> 3:49:50.920]  What were the underlying driving purposes behind his vision for computers for the Internet?
[3:49:50.920 --> 3:49:55.920]  It was one of measuring the population, of taking the pulse of the population,
[3:49:55.920 --> 3:50:01.920]  of understanding what people were thinking so that he could control what they were thinking.
[3:50:01.920 --> 3:50:03.920]  That was the vision of DARPA.
[3:50:03.920 --> 3:50:09.920]  That was the vision of Licklider, the psychologist who envisioned the Internet,
[3:50:09.920 --> 3:50:13.920]  who envisioned artificial intelligence and so many other aspects of things
[3:50:13.920 --> 3:50:19.920]  that I think have the great potential to control the population.
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:25.920]  You have to understand it was envisioned as a technological tool of population control.
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:27.920]  That's how he envisioned the Internet.
[3:50:27.920 --> 3:50:29.920]  Now things don't always go the way they planned.
[3:50:29.920 --> 3:50:35.920]  DARPA had a lot of GWIS nifty gadgets during the Cold War, during the Vietnam War,
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:37.920]  and yet they lost the Vietnam War.
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:41.920]  Our government has lost every asymmetric war they have ever fought,
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:44.920]  and they're losing in Iraq and Afghanistan as well.
[3:50:44.920 --> 3:50:46.920]  And that's the hope that we have.
[3:50:46.920 --> 3:50:51.920]  If we understand the nature of the enemy, we can defeat them in this information war.
[3:50:51.920 --> 3:50:56.920]  If we understand where they're coming, and it's a pincer that is both bureaucratic and technological,
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:50:58.920]  say what this will be right back.
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:00.920]  My name is Don Wiskin.
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:05.920]  In 1994, I lost my 62-year-old father to complications of bypass surgery.
[3:51:05.920 --> 3:51:09.920]  In 1977, my 44-year-old brother was found dead in his apartment.
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:11.920]  He suffered a heart attack.
[3:51:11.920 --> 3:51:15.920]  In January of 1998, my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed.
[3:51:15.920 --> 3:51:20.920]  21 days later, my 53-year-old brother passed away on his arrival to the hospital.
[3:51:20.920 --> 3:51:21.920]  He waited too long.
[3:51:21.920 --> 3:51:24.920]  In June that same year, I almost joined them at 42.
[3:51:24.920 --> 3:51:28.920]  What did I do? I took a seven-herb formula I now call Extendivite,
[3:51:28.920 --> 3:51:32.920]  made from garlic, cayenne, bilberry, ginkgo biloba, hawthorn, milk thistle, and valerian.
[3:51:32.920 --> 3:51:35.920]  Based on German studies of natural medicine,
[3:51:35.920 --> 3:51:39.920]  Extendivite is designed to clear block arteries, clean the toxins from your blood,
[3:51:39.920 --> 3:51:41.920]  and improve your immune system.
[3:51:41.920 --> 3:51:46.920]  To get your Extendivite, call 1-877-928-8822.
[3:51:46.920 --> 3:51:49.920]  That's 1-877-928-8822.

[3:53:57.920 --> 3:54:07.920]  Before you slip into unconsciousness.
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:10.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this last segment.
[3:54:10.920 --> 3:54:12.920]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[3:54:12.920 --> 3:54:16.920]  As I was just talking in the last segment, we were talking about the threat to the Internet.
[3:54:16.920 --> 3:54:20.920]  The fact that we have to understand where the threat is going to come from
[3:54:20.920 --> 3:54:23.920]  and the nature of the threat if we're going to be able to defeat it.
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:26.920]  Now I want to talk to you about the phony left-right paradigm.
[3:54:26.920 --> 3:54:27.920]  We talk about this all the time.
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:33.920]  The latest example is this new Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:37.920]  There were some articles that came out today as we learned that he's the new Prime Minister saying,
[3:54:37.920 --> 3:54:41.920]  well, perhaps he's going to push back against the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.
[3:54:41.920 --> 3:54:43.920]  No, I don't think so.
[3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:47.920]  Here's an article that came out a couple of weeks ago from the Canadian Progressive.
[3:54:47.920 --> 3:54:53.920]  And here's a quote from the Liberal Party that Trudeau is head of, that he just won the election.
[3:54:53.920 --> 3:54:56.920]  They say, the Liberal Party of Canada strongly supports free trade
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:03.920]  as this is how we open markets to Canadian goods and services, grow Canadian businesses, create good paying jobs, blah, blah, blah.
[3:55:03.920 --> 3:55:05.920]  That's not what it's about.
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:07.920]  That's not what the Trans-Pacific Partnership is about.
[3:55:07.920 --> 3:55:11.920]  And these people in the Canadian Progressive, they certainly know that's not what it's about.
[3:55:11.920 --> 3:55:17.920]  Their comment was, Justin Trudeau blindly endorses the secretive Trans-Pacific Partnership deal.
[3:55:17.920 --> 3:55:23.920]  Then he attacks Stephen Harper for failing to be transparent, especially in regards to what Canada is conceding.
[3:55:23.920 --> 3:55:28.920]  And of course, they think that that's going to be jobs in a certain area like dairy and auto.
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:29.920]  You know what?
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:32.920]  It's not going to be cows and cars that you're losing.
[3:55:32.920 --> 3:55:34.920]  It's your freedom that you're losing.
[3:55:34.920 --> 3:55:39.920]  You're losing ownership of everything to the multinational corporations who have written this,
[3:55:39.920 --> 3:55:43.920]  who are going to assert that they have copyright over everything forever.
[3:55:43.920 --> 3:55:45.920]  That's going to be what you're losing.
[3:55:45.920 --> 3:55:50.920]  You're going to be losing out to an organization that is going to set up global governance.
[3:55:50.920 --> 3:55:52.920]  That's what Senator Sessions told us.
[3:55:52.920 --> 3:55:56.920]  He actually read the piece and knows what's going on.
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:55:58.920]  He knows that this is a living agreement.
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:03.920]  He knows that regardless of what they eventually show us, and of course, we don't know.
[3:56:03.920 --> 3:56:10.920]  We were told that they had to keep it secret because you can't really negotiate a trade deal if everybody's micromanaging
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:13.920]  and keep it saying about what's on the particular trade deal.
[3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:15.920]  So we've got to keep that secret whilst being negotiated.
[3:56:15.920 --> 3:56:18.920]  Well, it's now been two or three weeks since they announced that they've finalized it.
[3:56:18.920 --> 3:56:19.920]  Have you seen it?
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:20.920]  No, they haven't made it public.
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:21.920]  It's still secret.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:22.920]  Why?
[3:56:22.920 --> 3:56:25.920]  Because they don't want you to have any time to take a look at it.
[3:56:25.920 --> 3:56:27.920]  They are going to rush this thing through.
[3:56:27.920 --> 3:56:30.920]  And they're going to rush it through with people like Justin Trudeau in Canada,
[3:56:30.920 --> 3:56:33.920]  with people like Paul Ryan and John Boehner in the United States.
[3:56:33.920 --> 3:56:40.920]  They're going to rush it through with their people at the top who are just a phony presentation.
[3:56:40.920 --> 3:56:45.920]  I thought it was very interesting to see the pictures that some of the mainstream media is putting up saying,
[3:56:45.920 --> 3:56:48.920]  Justin Trudeau, he's just such a hunk.
[3:56:48.920 --> 3:56:49.920]  He's so good looking.
[3:56:49.920 --> 3:56:50.920]  You know what?
[3:56:50.920 --> 3:56:52.920]  He's somebody like JFK.
[3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:57.920]  He's 43, and just like JFK, he comes from a political family dynasty.
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:02.920]  Like the Bushes, like the Clintons, like the Kennedys, this is the son of a former prime minister.
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:08.920]  And when they showed the pictures of these people, they also showed a picture of another hunk, Paul Ryan.
[3:57:08.920 --> 3:57:13.920]  Because, you know, it doesn't really matter that Paul Ryan masquerades as a conservative,
[3:57:13.920 --> 3:57:20.920]  but he's worked tirelessly for the last 25 years ever since he was in junior staffing positions
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:24.920]  for open borders, for trade deals that destroy our sovereignty.
[3:57:24.920 --> 3:57:31.920]  Paul Ryan is a conservative, and, you know, he's the only guy that is acceptable to his Majesty, John Boehner,
[3:57:31.920 --> 3:57:35.920]  who is going to kind of step down, but he's going to handpick his successor.
[3:57:35.920 --> 3:57:41.920]  And if you've got somebody, presumably, if they come to the election and Paul Ryan stands up and says,
[3:57:41.920 --> 3:57:46.920]  well, I decided not to do it like Kevin McCarthy did, the previous pick of John Boehner,
[3:57:46.920 --> 3:57:49.920]  then John Boehner, I guess, will just shut the election down again.
[3:57:49.920 --> 3:57:56.920]  Why don't the conservatives move forward with this motion to vacate the chair?
[3:57:56.920 --> 3:58:01.920]  This motion was introduced before they went to summer break.
[3:58:01.920 --> 3:58:05.920]  They tabled it until it came back, and then John Boehner said, well, I'm going to step down.
[3:58:05.920 --> 3:58:08.920]  Well, he said he's not stepping down until he gets somebody he wants.
[3:58:08.920 --> 3:58:15.920]  Push the issue. Throw this guy out, because Paul Ryan is nothing but another corporatist,
[3:58:15.920 --> 3:58:19.920]  somebody who is owned by the multinational corporations. He's for open borders.
[3:58:19.920 --> 3:58:24.920]  He's for global trade agreements that are going to destroy our borders.
[3:58:24.920 --> 3:58:28.920]  That's what he's about. He's just like John Boehner. He's just like Justin Trudeau.
[3:58:28.920 --> 3:58:30.920]  He's just like Bernie Sanders and the rest of them.
[3:58:30.920 --> 3:58:46.920]  That's it for today's show. Join us tonight at 7 Central, 8 p.m. for the Nightly News.
