[00:17.700 --> 00:20.300]  jones
[00:20.820 --> 00:29.580]  something happened yesterday that really captured the world's attention the
[00:29.580 --> 00:39.600]  mayor of chicago miss lightfoot came out and said that she was hiring police and
[00:39.600 --> 00:48.160]  bureaucrats that pledge allegiance to the new world order now when it went
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.080]  super viral with millions of views on youtube twitter and facebook they put
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.480]  fact checks on it saying there is no new world order it doesn't exist this is out
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.820]  context but everybody could see it in the context and so now they've removed
[01:00.820 --> 01:07.740]  the video total lifetime censorship so what I did is I went and pulled some of
[01:07.740 --> 01:13.340]  the famous quotes and videos of world leaders saying you will not be allowed to
[01:13.340 --> 01:19.420]  live in the future unless you pledge allegiance to the new world order and
[01:19.420 --> 01:27.780]  lucifer and the united nations chapel in new york is dedicated to lucifer and is
[01:27.780 --> 01:37.200]  paid for by the lucious trust of madam blavosky hitler's main advisor that's

[01:43.460 --> 01:46.580]  at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna read you some of the famous quotes about
[01:46.580 --> 01:50.540]  you will not go into the new age unless you pledge allegiance to the new world
[01:50.540 --> 01:57.820]  order and pledge yourself to lucifer and this is world leaders saying this
[01:57.820 --> 02:04.580]  france wall meet all wrong and others he was the french president who built
[02:04.580 --> 02:17.540]  commissioned the pink pyramid at the Louvre with 666 pieces of glass and all
[02:17.540 --> 02:22.020]  the bill numbers for contact tracing and implantable microchips just so happened
[02:22.020 --> 02:31.940]  to be 666 because they got to leave their game card there because
[02:31.940 --> 02:36.700]  metaphysically they have to tell you what they're doing so just like that
[02:36.700 --> 02:40.460]  click we're inside the new world order ladies and gentlemen and they're
[02:40.460 --> 02:44.060]  saying hey the lockdowns never gonna end it's gonna be cycled on and cycled off
[02:44.060 --> 02:47.700]  you have to carry a cell phone by law and then we'll have an app on it that
[02:47.700 --> 02:52.660]  tracks what you do it's already being tested in blue cities and in blue
[02:52.660 --> 02:58.900]  countries loveless countries around the world and then we've got the big giant
[02:58.900 --> 03:05.620]  enchilada as the show was ending yesterday I had Robert Barnes on with me
[03:05.620 --> 03:09.220]  was talking about yeah Trump says he'll use the military for vaccines I hadn't
[03:09.220 --> 03:13.220]  seen that he just said that right before Barnes came on I got off the air and
[03:13.220 --> 03:17.260]  went watch the video my mouth hanging open shot a report on it that's it band
[03:17.260 --> 03:23.260]  on video then I really had time to cogitate on it and I don't agree with
[03:23.260 --> 03:27.460]  it obviously on the surface but there is something else behind it and as soon
[03:27.460 --> 03:30.660]  as I came in this morning was reading the news indeed what I thought Trump is
[03:30.660 --> 03:38.460]  up to he's up to some very dangerous game I had been let in on the game and I'm
[03:38.460 --> 03:44.740]  not playing the game I'm with me it's all full frontal assault I just do not
[03:44.740 --> 03:49.380]  engage in subterfuge except when I do it subconsciously then I do it really well
[03:49.380 --> 03:54.060]  it's not good and I pray that God deliver me from those activities but I don't
[03:54.060 --> 03:58.940]  like to lose I'll be honest with you but sometimes I do really nasty things like
[03:58.940 --> 04:02.380]  little devil takes over for a minute I'm like what did I just do and later I see
[04:02.380 --> 04:12.300]  the effects of it it always works up front but evil boomerangs back and well
[04:12.300 --> 04:17.820]  you've trumped serious about this how do you get off the Trump train and but not
[04:17.820 --> 04:22.380]  be on the new water train well see I wouldn't be leaving Trump he'd be leaving
[04:22.380 --> 04:27.580]  me I'm not getting off the Americana populism Christian freedom self-defense
[04:27.580 --> 04:32.900]  capitalist train if Trump gets off the train that's his problem we just keep

[06:31.620 --> 06:36.540]  show feed article today that I hope you'll share and this isn't hyperbole in
[06:36.540 --> 06:41.180]  fact words can't describe how bad this is this is reality this is a hundred
[06:41.180 --> 06:46.100]  percent real it's official COVID-19 is a United Nations world government fascist
[06:46.100 --> 06:51.220]  takeover of humanity once world government is in place the orderly
[06:51.220 --> 06:59.740]  extermination of humanity will be carried out by the AI genocide grid now
[06:59.740 --> 07:07.300]  they need a total medical tyranny in place and a total censorship grid so
[07:07.300 --> 07:13.140]  that once their world government is in place they can with electromagnetic
[07:13.140 --> 07:19.380]  waves with radiation with chemicals and biologicals accelerate the
[07:19.380 --> 07:23.820]  extermination of humanity and once they get a stampede going once they get a
[07:23.820 --> 07:28.060]  mass collapse going once they know with probability and have the smart grid in
[07:28.060 --> 07:33.380]  place to track your your execution they will then release bio weapons and other
[07:33.380 --> 07:38.860]  systems knowing that you will just simply shelter in place waiting for the
[07:38.860 --> 07:43.940]  driverless trash truck to arrive with the robots that will offload go in and
[07:43.940 --> 07:48.180]  put your bodies in bags take you out throw you in the back and take you for
[07:48.180 --> 07:54.700]  processing so this this whole system is a human extermination grid now I want
[07:54.700 --> 07:58.860]  to explain something to you you've seen everything we've talked about come true
[07:58.860 --> 08:03.980]  to this point and most people don't research what I say they just think oh
[08:03.980 --> 08:13.140]  Jones said this no the club of Rome the CFR the United Nations the UN
[08:13.140 --> 08:19.900]  biological diversity assessments UN agenda 2020 in a 2030 they state that
[08:19.900 --> 08:25.580]  they want to get the human population down to 500 million to quote live in
[08:25.580 --> 08:31.980]  harmony with the earth now that's what they tell people that are in the outer
[08:31.980 --> 08:38.220]  court when you get into the deeper cult they say no all humans must be gotten
[08:38.220 --> 08:42.780]  rid of humans are inherently bad and we're gonna merge with silicon and become
[08:42.780 --> 08:46.700]  gods now I tell you that 26 years ago and it sounded crazy because these people
[08:46.700 --> 08:51.260]  are crazy now you're like yeah I saw that on CNN or ABC news or I read a book
[08:51.260 --> 08:55.260]  about the world without humans and they teach school kids that were bad and NBC
[08:55.260 --> 08:59.060]  news says they'll soon be no humans left by 2050 because we're gonna merge the
[08:59.060 --> 09:05.340]  machines and then they will get rid of the humans and this is really their
[09:05.340 --> 09:10.900]  plan and so of course when they said we'll be locked down for two weeks it
[09:10.900 --> 09:20.060]  was permanent of course when they push all this it's total lies of course they
[09:20.060 --> 09:28.460]  are counting on you believing you're compliant because you're told you're a
[09:28.460 --> 09:33.140]  hero when really all you're doing is collapsing the global economy the third
[09:33.140 --> 09:38.020]  world is totally dependent on us we are dependent on the third world you cut the
[09:38.020 --> 09:44.020]  two the global structure falls a war a world war could not bring us to our
[09:44.020 --> 09:47.460]  knees like this is going to do unless nuclear weapons were used but nuclear
[09:47.460 --> 09:52.900]  weapons will kill the planet for the establishment so they're not using
[09:52.900 --> 09:57.180]  nuclear weapons they're using economic warfare and psychological warfare to
[09:57.180 --> 10:03.380]  carry all of this out so let me just read you some of the headlines that are
[10:03.380 --> 10:07.780]  coming up today US News and World Report Trump mobilizing US military to
[10:07.780 --> 10:13.500]  deliver coronavirus vaccine government could enforce who you're allowed to

[13:11.340 --> 13:16.180]  other side but this little tidbit goes with it it's a political article the
[13:16.180 --> 13:25.220]  coronavirus pandemic broke America no the UN the WHO the corporate media big

[13:54.940 --> 13:58.300]  that you're gonna blame Trump's policies when the whole thing was launched by the
[13:58.300 --> 14:04.060]  new world order we'll talk about Trump's pivot at least with rhetoric about the
[14:04.060 --> 14:10.900]  military and the vaccine by the election that's all coming up separately we sell
[14:10.900 --> 14:15.140]  high-quality storeable food and I told you 13 weeks ago when I really started

[14:21.220 --> 14:24.700]  got food deliveries getting people quicker now because they've got the food

[14:28.660 --> 14:32.700]  quickly they're getting ahead of schedule but the orders are increasing so
[14:32.700 --> 14:36.260]  there may come a time where they have to pause taking future orders while they get
[14:36.260 --> 14:41.140]  out the orders they have other storeable food out there is crap it's old or they
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.260]  don't have it they take your money and then try to rope a dope you over the

[17:43.940 --> 17:49.100]  synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula so what
[17:49.100 --> 17:54.060]  are you waiting for go to the n4 store never been a better time than right now
[17:54.060 --> 18:00.380]  super male vitality at n4store.com
[18:01.220 --> 18:06.660]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:06.660 --> 18:18.260]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[18:22.020 --> 18:26.620]  all right next segment I'm gonna show you from the congressional and United
[18:26.620 --> 18:32.060]  Nations public record that they make members of the New World Order pledge
[18:32.060 --> 18:36.780]  allegiance to the New World Order and to the world government for which it
[18:36.780 --> 18:42.700]  stands one controlling central committee dominating the entire planet in every
[18:42.700 --> 18:45.300]  human on it
[18:48.060 --> 18:53.100]  that is coming up member William Benny former technical director of the
[18:53.100 --> 18:56.500]  national security agency that said Trump was being spot on four years ago had a
[18:56.500 --> 19:01.220]  very interesting talk with him off record yesterday I'll leave it at that but
[19:01.220 --> 19:09.620]  here is the London Guardian from a few years ago the ultimate goal of the NSA
[19:09.620 --> 19:19.420]  is total population control hard to believe that was six years ago he spoke
[19:19.420 --> 19:26.300]  to the European Union and the British Parliament told him that and now you have
[19:26.300 --> 19:29.940]  the rollout to track and trace and watch everything you do with even citizen
[19:29.940 --> 19:35.900]  brigades being set up by the UN directive and we have the UN telling
[19:35.900 --> 19:44.860]  everyone what our doctors can do it's not even the FDA it's the UN doctors were
[19:44.860 --> 19:48.500]  always allowed to give things off label for prescriptions but when the UN said
[19:48.500 --> 19:53.100]  you can't prescribe hydroxychloroquine or you can't do this or that they said
[19:53.100 --> 19:57.300]  yes sir the UN came out and said mouthwash doesn't kill viruses of course
[19:57.300 --> 20:03.420]  it does now the FBI is rating people doing that they told Listerine you
[20:03.420 --> 20:09.940]  don't dare say you kill viruses because the UN is God and when they say jump you
[20:09.940 --> 20:19.420]  say how high now it was like a punch in the stomach yesterday when after the
[20:19.420 --> 20:25.220]  show I learned that President Trump had said this here it is
[20:25.220 --> 20:29.300]  yeah I think we're gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year we're doing very
[20:29.300 --> 20:33.740]  well with a vaccine and I will tell you something I just literally left a
[20:33.740 --> 20:38.860]  meeting we're mobilizing our military and other forces but we're mobilizing our
[20:38.860 --> 20:44.020]  military on the basis that we do have a vaccine you know it's a massive job to
[20:44.020 --> 20:48.980]  give this vaccine our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the
[20:48.980 --> 20:54.780]  year we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very very rapidly now
[20:54.780 --> 21:00.860]  I've got a lot of problems with that and if that's actually what Trump wants to
[21:00.860 --> 21:09.220]  do then I will be forced to move that Trump be thrown off the populist train
[21:09.220 --> 21:13.180]  politically because I'm not getting off the Trump train because this train isn't
[21:13.180 --> 21:18.020]  a Trump train it's a populist pro-human train now that said I know what Trump's
[21:18.020 --> 21:23.020]  doing Trump finally figured out that Fauci's deep state
[21:23.020 --> 21:26.260]  billamanda gates you in he finally figured out they're undermining
[21:26.260 --> 21:29.940]  everything exaggerating the death numbers adding all these people that died
[21:29.940 --> 21:33.300]  of other things on the list that's all confirmed they even tell you they're
[21:33.300 --> 21:36.660]  doing that the fine print because it's such fraud but by telling you you see
[21:36.660 --> 21:43.420]  it's not fraud they're hiding it in plain view and so Trump just like when they
[21:43.420 --> 21:47.980]  had the Vegas event and they had the Texas Walmart shooting he came and he
[21:47.980 --> 21:52.420]  said okay fine maybe we should ban the semi-autos Democrats what do you want
[21:52.420 --> 21:59.700]  they said we want to ban everything and then they got nothing and I talked to
[21:59.700 --> 22:04.900]  two different NRA board members who separately said look we've met with the
[22:04.900 --> 22:12.420]  president when there's another mass shooting this is before Walmart you know
[22:12.420 --> 22:18.660]  Paso they said he's got a tactic where he says okay I agree with you because then
[22:18.660 --> 22:23.180]  he's such a lightning rod it it makes the left not be energized on that topic
[22:23.180 --> 22:27.180]  and it makes them drop the topic but if Trump says no you're not getting the
[22:27.180 --> 22:30.420]  guns then it becomes a lightning rod and helps them so psychological warfare
[22:30.420 --> 22:33.780]  tactic he's being advised by some smart people except that's a dangerous game
[22:33.780 --> 22:40.220]  because he's endorsing gun control even though he's killing the measure and so
[22:40.220 --> 22:45.060]  he knows that the blue states the blue cities are gonna come out with their own
[22:45.060 --> 22:50.140]  vaccines have people signed forms that they waive their rights to sue and take
[22:50.140 --> 22:53.620]  them he knows the UN is the power vacuum saying they're gonna have the
[22:53.620 --> 22:57.780]  vaccine so he's stepping up saying you know what I'm for the vaccine now and
[22:57.780 --> 23:04.060]  we'll have the military do it not the Clinton global initiative with a board
[23:04.060 --> 23:08.980]  of George Soros Hillary Clinton Chelsea Clinton Billa Melinda Gates that is
[23:08.980 --> 23:16.260]  already recruiting through the move on org the contact tracers to get city
[23:16.260 --> 23:22.860]  County and federal money to literally come to your house and they're using it
[23:22.860 --> 23:27.460]  to mobilize their malice forces under the guise of them being heroes in
[23:27.460 --> 23:34.700]  forcing social distancing so I know why Trump did this he did this because he
[23:34.700 --> 23:38.380]  sidelined Fauci and sidelined all these people I told you that three weeks ago
[23:38.380 --> 23:45.180]  now it's confirmed and then he's just usurping their whole game by going okay
[23:45.180 --> 23:52.100]  the military will carry this out and then six months is a hundred years people
[23:52.100 --> 23:56.020]  forget about it so Trump is engaged in their own tactics at a more sophisticated
[23:56.020 --> 23:59.660]  level that is what he's doing and you notice also what he did because I thought
[23:59.660 --> 24:02.780]  about this like three hours last night and more than three hours this morning
[24:02.780 --> 24:08.300]  I mean I really sat there in a room with the blinds pulled and just focusing on
[24:08.300 --> 24:11.660]  this and not trying to convince myself Trump's good because if I figured out
[24:11.660 --> 24:15.220]  Trump was bad I'll come after him so fast to make your head spin and I still
[24:15.220 --> 24:19.620]  think it's a very dangerous tactic and I don't agree with it but Trump then went
[24:19.620 --> 24:29.020]  on and said oh we're gonna give it to old people first knowing that with the
[24:29.020 --> 24:33.700]  adjuvant what doesn't hurt old people as bad as it hurts young people he's like
[24:33.700 --> 24:36.860]  we're gonna test it on the old people and I say damn right they want to take it
[24:36.860 --> 24:43.500]  do it and so that's what Trump's doing he's learned that if he doesn't resist
[24:43.500 --> 24:51.140]  something before it's available that it kills it and it's a very Machiavelli
[24:51.140 --> 24:57.860]  move and I don't like it but I can see what he's doing and by the way I'm not
[24:57.860 --> 25:03.620]  twisting this into the position of agreeing with the president the
[25:03.620 --> 25:06.820]  president wanted me to know what he was doing with the gun control and he said
[25:06.820 --> 25:12.140]  watch you're gonna see what happens by us going oh sure take all the guns that
[25:12.140 --> 25:15.660]  only woke America up more to get Democrats to say we want everything
[25:15.660 --> 25:22.620]  banned except bolt action single shot and notice where's their gun control now
[25:22.620 --> 25:27.540]  dead because he didn't fight him he went oh yeah sure don't have the votes
[25:27.540 --> 25:32.660]  though it's still very very dangerous and that's what Trump's doing on this
[25:32.660 --> 25:36.460]  because Trump came out and said that seems to be dangerous a month ago
[25:36.460 --> 25:40.780]  Fauci said oh well there's gonna be side effects as they know there are they
[25:40.780 --> 25:44.940]  can't hide that anymore well the UN back in December said we can't hide this
[25:44.940 --> 25:48.260]  anymore too many people are hurt doctors don't trust us they know they're hurt so
[25:48.260 --> 25:53.100]  instead of lying about it they're gonna go okay it does hurt people but it's for
[25:53.100 --> 25:55.340]  the greater good we've got to do it because that's what they tell health
[25:55.340 --> 25:59.940]  department heads and bioethics boards the boards of hospitals and clinics know
[25:59.940 --> 26:03.740]  this stuff the heads of health departments I ran into the head policy
[26:03.740 --> 26:08.300]  person for the Texas Board of Health Texas Health Department like five years
[26:08.300 --> 26:14.660]  ago on the hiking bike trail I looked the guy's name up later and he's like
[26:14.660 --> 26:17.940]  Alex I know vaccines kill and hurt some people but it's overall it saves more
[26:17.940 --> 26:20.820]  lives I started arguing with him about the numbers and then he kind of got
[26:20.820 --> 26:25.460]  freaked out because I knew the numbers no folks it's social control and they're
[26:25.460 --> 26:29.580]  lowering IQs they're lowering immunity these things are killing us and they're
[26:29.580 --> 26:33.860]  tainted with cancer viruses you name it it's a nightmare we're living less not
[26:33.860 --> 26:40.380]  longer folks these people are killing us so
[26:41.100 --> 26:44.940]  you're walking on the fighting side of me with these forced inoculations to get
[26:44.940 --> 26:48.660]  on airplanes or have a job and we're gonna happen to go to physical
[26:48.660 --> 26:52.340]  revolution if they try this so whoever puts their name on it is an enemy of
[26:52.340 --> 26:57.140]  America an enemy of the Republic I pledge allegiance to Jesus Christ I don't
[26:57.140 --> 27:01.540]  have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history the
[27:01.540 --> 27:04.860]  globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're
[27:04.860 --> 27:09.620]  like yeah you're taking implantable chips yeah we're into pedophilia yeah
[27:09.620 --> 27:15.380]  we're into world government yeah you're obsolete you are not essential we are
[27:15.380 --> 27:20.180]  shutting your ass down yeah we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers
[27:20.180 --> 27:23.340]  and don't work at industry anymore you're gonna be the service economy and
[27:23.340 --> 27:27.500]  now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and
[27:27.500 --> 27:31.900]  you're obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance
[27:31.900 --> 27:37.220]  income so they can dictate your life the handcuffs are going on right now we
[27:37.220 --> 27:40.580]  have to resist and say no to the new world order and that takes you
[27:40.580 --> 27:44.460]  understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting in
[27:44.460 --> 27:49.660]  people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can now is the time for
[27:49.660 --> 27:54.060]  action now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you
[27:54.060 --> 28:01.780]  are what info wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers
[28:01.780 --> 28:07.940]  and your word of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is
[28:07.940 --> 28:13.500]  the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being
[28:13.500 --> 28:19.900]  established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal
[28:19.900 --> 28:25.500]  operations of the globalists are being externalized you must decide which side
[28:25.500 --> 28:30.380]  you're on living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome learned helplessness
[28:30.380 --> 28:35.820]  will only deliver you into misery destruction and finally death and this
[28:35.820 --> 28:40.220]  is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical death the
[28:40.220 --> 28:45.940]  delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all we have come so
[28:45.940 --> 28:49.500]  far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new world order
[28:49.500 --> 28:54.940]  decided to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose
[28:54.940 --> 29:00.500]  our souls the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates
[29:00.500 --> 29:06.700]  media and the chai comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression fact
[29:06.700 --> 29:09.860]  we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for
[29:09.860 --> 29:14.500]  the third world but it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown
[29:14.500 --> 29:20.420]  persist the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will destroy decades
[29:20.420 --> 29:24.140]  of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we've always
[29:24.140 --> 29:27.980]  said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because
[29:27.980 --> 29:31.620]  the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their
[29:31.620 --> 29:37.580]  control they've admitted all of this so remember how does info wars continue
[29:37.580 --> 29:41.580]  years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they
[29:41.580 --> 29:45.900]  happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle
[29:45.900 --> 29:50.500]  plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting them
[29:50.500 --> 29:54.860]  carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and
[29:54.860 --> 29:58.180]  realize what's really happening
[29:58.180 --> 30:08.020]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:28.180 --> 30:35.580]  driving up the way things are big and I don't mind them switching sides and
[30:35.580 --> 30:42.340]  standing up for things they believe in when they're running down our country
[30:42.340 --> 30:52.100]  they're walking on the fighting side of me
[30:52.100 --> 30:59.580]  running down a way of life are fighting men have fought and died you don't love
[30:59.580 --> 31:05.340]  it leave it you don't love it leave it let this song that I'm singing the award
[31:05.340 --> 31:13.020]  to you when you're running down our country you're walking on the fighting side of me
[31:13.020 --> 31:19.180]  all right I'm gonna cover something that is the most paramount issue in the
[31:19.180 --> 31:25.500]  universe as Bob Dylan says you got to serve somebody you got to serve something
[31:25.500 --> 31:31.180]  I pledge allegiance to Jesus Christ and I live in America and I know the fight
[31:31.180 --> 31:34.420]  this country's been through and it's special destiny so I pledge allegiance
[31:34.420 --> 31:38.460]  to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
[31:38.460 --> 31:45.420]  it stands one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all
[31:45.420 --> 31:53.580]  now the oath to the New World Order is secret but the oath to the UN is
[31:53.580 --> 32:04.460]  public but I have been asked to give the oath when they offered me a sellout plan
[32:04.460 --> 32:11.380]  and it was directly to Lucifer now Mark Dice thought I was crazy when I told him
[32:11.380 --> 32:14.620]  that 20 years ago until it happened to him when he was about to get a top TV
[32:14.620 --> 32:19.260]  show deal and I knew who was involved I mean I knew the company it happened they
[32:19.260 --> 32:23.020]  said Mark this isn't something as you're a Christian we're not just doing this to
[32:23.020 --> 32:25.660]  run you off we want to do this show with you but we need you to pledge allegiance
[32:25.660 --> 32:35.980]  to Lucifer he runs things so I didn't get up to what the oath is but I can assure
[32:35.980 --> 32:40.460]  you there is an oath to Lucifer now the reason I'm covering this is it's in the
[32:40.460 --> 32:48.060]  news today so let's cover it right now this is from a global nation director
[32:48.060 --> 32:53.420]  of planetary initiative United Nations no one will enter the New World Order
[32:53.420 --> 32:58.460]  unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer no one will enter the
[32:58.460 --> 33:06.820]  new age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation this is a book put out by the
[33:06.820 --> 33:12.940]  UN here's some more quotes Arthur Schlesinger we are not going to achieve
[33:12.940 --> 33:17.620]  a New World Order without paying for it in blood as well as words and money and
[33:17.620 --> 33:25.580]  they go on here to talk about pledging yourself to the New World Order they talk
[33:25.580 --> 33:28.900]  about using an alien threat a biological weapons threat or an economic
[33:28.900 --> 33:34.780]  collapse threat to make us all pledge allegiance to our world government now
[33:34.780 --> 33:42.020]  by the way when I first was reading this stuff when I was a teenager I remember
[33:42.020 --> 33:45.100]  asking my dad I said is this all true he said yeah why don't you go to a law
[33:45.100 --> 33:50.180]  library a big University library why don't you see it for yourself so the
[33:50.180 --> 33:56.820]  time I hit about 18 I would go down this is important stuff and I'd go to the UT
[33:56.820 --> 34:03.140]  library and I actually pulled these books out and I mean years later I went
[34:03.140 --> 34:07.180]  down there and you know shot footage of this and put up my films and I pulled
[34:07.180 --> 34:11.900]  these books and I pulled the UN documents these aren't just quotes off the
[34:11.900 --> 34:16.340]  internet they said this stuff in Congress they said you've got to pledge
[34:16.340 --> 34:21.820]  allegiance to the New World Order but hey you don't need to hear that from me
[34:21.820 --> 34:32.660]  you've seen Lightfoot the mayor of the once great city Chicago up there saying
[34:32.660 --> 34:35.860]  she can go out in public but you can if she catches you you're going to jail they
[34:35.860 --> 34:40.700]  let the murderers the rapists the child molesters out and she put a video out
[34:40.700 --> 34:45.780]  herself saying that she had an executive order to take over to get the
[34:45.780 --> 34:50.940]  police everybody under her control in the New World Order to then pledge
[34:50.940 --> 34:55.460]  allegiance to the New World Order well Facebook Twitter Google said oh no fact
[34:55.460 --> 34:59.300]  check she didn't mean that people saw the video and it backfired so they've
[34:59.300 --> 35:04.660]  removed the video that's why it's now a band-aid video but again she's not just
[35:04.660 --> 35:11.580]  saying this you pledge allegiance to it don't you know if you were a Chinese spy
[35:11.580 --> 35:14.620]  you pledge allegiance to that don't you know that if you're in a devil cult you
[35:14.620 --> 35:18.140]  pledge allegiance if you're an MS-13 you pledge allegiance you swear and oath
[35:18.140 --> 35:22.540]  that you join the US military all organizations have oaths no borders no
[35:22.540 --> 35:26.860]  wall no USA at all these are globalists trying to bankrupt the country trying to
[35:26.860 --> 35:30.500]  keep it locked down they admit that's their plan Bill Mars gone on TV and said
[35:30.500 --> 35:35.940]  I want a depression to punish Trump supporters that's what this is COVID-19
[35:35.940 --> 35:41.300]  is a souped-up cold virus and they count everybody that dies is dying of
[35:41.300 --> 35:46.580]  COVID-19 that's all confirmed so the response is a hoax but the collapse is
[35:46.580 --> 35:51.980]  real so I'm gonna play you a clip of her and I'm gonna play you a five minute
[35:51.980 --> 35:57.700]  compilation that we finished up in like 2013 we this is on our computers this is
[35:57.700 --> 36:01.300]  just up until that point of people saying the New World Order is world
[36:01.300 --> 36:05.180]  government and that you must accept it
[36:06.020 --> 36:10.460]  Francois Mitterrand pledged that the New World Order was a ritual to Lucifer you
[36:10.460 --> 36:17.860]  can pull that up I've got the quotes right here he put that in a book he wrote
[36:17.860 --> 36:22.260]  and I had nightline here once interview me they go there's no New World Order I
[36:22.260 --> 36:25.700]  showed him a bunch of clips the clips you're about to see and that and the
[36:25.700 --> 36:29.140]  host of nightline looked me he goes Alex that's a different world government
[36:29.140 --> 36:37.860]  that you're talking about it's called gaslighting now here's the deal if this
[36:37.860 --> 36:40.900]  was a New World Order bringing capitalist society and empowerment and
[36:40.900 --> 36:44.740]  pro-human future it was bettered America I'd say hey I'm no longer an American I
[36:44.740 --> 36:50.020]  sign up with these dudes this thing is horrible end of civilization pedophile
[36:50.020 --> 36:56.220]  Satanism I will fight to the death against these people because it's
[36:56.220 --> 37:02.820]  spiritual death to go along with them but here she is with pleasure because like
[37:02.820 --> 37:07.140]  Brian Stelter or Hillary Clinton or any of these people or Oliver Darcy they
[37:07.140 --> 37:12.300]  want power because they're weak they have signed on with the world government
[37:12.300 --> 37:15.820]  system and the Pope is saying Christianity you don't need to open up to
[37:15.820 --> 37:19.700]  Islam and that the families you know all this everything's under attack now the
[37:19.700 --> 37:24.300]  enemy has uncloaked it's taken over all the major institutions it's censoring
[37:24.300 --> 37:28.940]  everything and I'm freaked out that info wars is one of the last rag tag groups
[37:28.940 --> 37:34.700]  that didn't sell out because I already sold out to Christ and that does not
[37:34.700 --> 37:39.700]  mean those whore churches that are the biggest dens of devils you will find
[37:39.700 --> 37:45.460]  almost all churches are now demonic command bases fire bases the enemy is
[37:45.460 --> 37:49.380]  taking everything over except your heart and your soul and your connection to God
[37:49.380 --> 37:53.260]  you open up you could defeat the enemy anytime by letting God do it for you
[37:53.260 --> 38:02.940]  commit yourself into Christ hands this is a satanic enemy we're fighting so here
[38:02.940 --> 38:07.540]  is this true servant of Satan being protected from her own words because
[38:07.540 --> 38:12.940]  you're not supposed to know about the Luciferian initiation here it is one I
[38:12.940 --> 38:18.580]  would I'm thinking about an executive order from day one that says you know
[38:18.580 --> 38:23.420]  in more legalese in this this is not a thing we will not no longer honor this
[38:23.420 --> 38:27.580]  because the way that automatic prerogative works is there's got to be
[38:27.580 --> 38:33.500]  compliance with the executive branch because otherwise it doesn't work so you
[38:33.500 --> 38:37.860]  got to eliminate that compliance and you make it a mandate and then you do
[38:37.860 --> 38:42.140]  training particularly in the city I'll call them licensing departments whether
[38:42.140 --> 38:49.380]  it's zoning buildings housing will be impacted by planning certainly and it's
[38:49.380 --> 38:54.220]  and you and you pick the people that run those agencies and the deputies that
[38:54.220 --> 38:59.300]  are pledging allusions to the new world order and good governance and then I
[38:59.300 --> 39:04.740]  think you have the inspector general do some spot edits to make sure that there
[39:04.740 --> 39:09.620]  is real compliance they never call it government they call it governance and
[39:09.620 --> 39:15.380]  she's saying agenda 2020 agenda 2030 that's it at the low level it's it's the
[39:15.380 --> 39:19.460]  grassroots control of zoning your life making it impossible to live making it
[39:19.460 --> 39:22.100]  possible to have a small business that's what all this is about and now they're
[39:22.100 --> 39:26.980]  like hey you're not essential your small businesses ain't ever opening up
[39:26.980 --> 39:32.820]  there's a power move and she's right up there telling you the whole nine yards
[39:32.820 --> 39:36.540]  when we come back we're gonna show you US presidents British prime ministers
[39:36.540 --> 39:43.460]  German chancellors pledging themselves to the new world order remember this is
[39:43.460 --> 39:46.420]  not allowed to be seen anywhere this is all being removed everywhere only band

[41:07.020 --> 41:13.100]  organs but all of the news we see the UN billable indicates WHO mainstream
[41:13.100 --> 41:17.780]  corporate media praising communist China for their response and if communist
[41:17.780 --> 41:21.460]  China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[41:21.460 --> 41:25.500]  robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it
[41:25.500 --> 41:28.940]  cities like San Antonio passed laws saying will arrest you if you say
[41:28.940 --> 41:33.220]  Chinese virus well now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus
[41:33.220 --> 41:38.140]  these people are out of control control freaks and they are going to lose big
[41:38.140 --> 41:41.860]  time because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are
[41:41.860 --> 41:46.540]  exposing them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and
[41:46.540 --> 41:51.220]  info wars dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and
[41:51.220 --> 41:57.140]  then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker I don't
[41:57.140 --> 42:00.460]  like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and
[42:00.460 --> 42:03.900]  listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things but you notice
[42:03.900 --> 42:08.140]  almost everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning
[42:08.140 --> 42:13.700]  everybody to try to stop it it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put
[42:13.700 --> 42:16.620]  a fence around it if you have little kids because even if they're good
[42:16.620 --> 42:19.900]  swimmers they can hit their head and drown people don't listen they go out
[42:19.900 --> 42:23.300]  and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is the death
[42:23.300 --> 42:27.180]  of the third world the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century
[42:27.180 --> 42:32.460]  warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it they
[42:32.460 --> 42:35.860]  admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more
[42:35.860 --> 42:40.420]  frugal and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this
[42:40.420 --> 42:44.900]  post-human technocracy I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about
[42:44.900 --> 42:50.100]  25 years ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual I wish
[42:50.100 --> 42:54.020]  this wasn't the case but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most
[42:54.020 --> 42:58.620]  major institutions and we've got to stop them Holland block has really been a
[42:58.620 --> 43:03.060]  sleeper product for us we got it in a few years ago it's an amazing product
[43:03.060 --> 43:07.700]  that comes from all natural quail eggs they discovered this more than 30 years
[43:07.700 --> 43:12.660]  ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from a certain type of quail that it
[43:12.660 --> 43:16.780]  had an antihistamine effect and people saw their allergies and seasonal
[43:16.780 --> 43:21.300]  discomfort knocked way way down well now this is available in the United States
[43:21.300 --> 43:25.740]  it's proprietary it has rave reviews it's a product that I never even really
[43:25.740 --> 43:30.060]  promote but that people keep reordering and has become a best-selling we're
[43:30.060 --> 43:34.140]  very close to selling out Holland block right now it'll take eight weeks to get
[43:34.140 --> 43:39.260]  more in but despite that I'm gonna sell it at 50% off until it sells out so for
[43:39.260 --> 43:42.980]  those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence that seasonal
[43:42.980 --> 43:48.100]  discomfort experience pollen block for yourself right now at m4store.com
[43:48.100 --> 43:53.180]  for 50% off pollen block I want people that haven't tried it to try it for
[43:53.180 --> 43:58.220]  themselves so it's the lowest price ever even though it's selling out
[43:59.660 --> 44:05.180]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:05.180 --> 44:26.020]  the answer the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:27.020 --> 44:33.500]  alright so the mayor of Chicago puts out a video about how she took control of
[44:33.500 --> 44:37.700]  bureaucracy and how she has executive power to rule everyone arrest whoever
[44:37.700 --> 44:41.820]  she wants and how they're using zoning to totally dominate everybody that's a
[44:41.820 --> 44:49.420]  gender 2020 gender 2030 under the UN and how it's the new world order which is the
[44:49.420 --> 44:56.020]  by word not even the code word for their world takeover the first time new
[44:56.020 --> 45:00.700]  world order was used was by HD Wells and British intelligence about 120 years
[45:00.700 --> 45:04.780]  ago and then Hitler picked it up and Hitler had a plan to kill HD Wells
[45:04.780 --> 45:08.180]  because he had a competing new world order and Hitler stole his new world
[45:08.180 --> 45:12.500]  order plan it's all insane so that's why so much of the lefts plan looks like
[45:12.500 --> 45:17.620]  Hitler because he was competing plants by the way this is all mainline history
[45:17.620 --> 45:25.620]  it's just it's not taught on say discovery channel or history channel so and
[45:25.620 --> 45:30.660]  the communists being put in charge of Russia was just because Russia kept
[45:30.660 --> 45:35.100]  getting in the way of the British Empire in its new world order and they wrote
[45:35.100 --> 45:38.140]  about that too it's crazy when you read Bertrand Russell and all these guys
[45:38.140 --> 45:42.580]  being completely honest by how it works and then Zbigniew Brzezinski and
[45:42.580 --> 45:46.900]  Carol Quigley later and that's what's so frustrating is folks I'm telling you
[45:46.900 --> 45:50.460]  the battle plan none of this is my opinion it's again I don't have a
[45:50.460 --> 45:57.700]  crystal ball this is a real group John Harman heard the head of the Kissinger
[45:57.700 --> 46:01.460]  group on the phone when he was screening the calls had him on as a guest
[46:01.460 --> 46:06.380]  trying to get me to sell out that's the only time well it's happened twice where
[46:06.380 --> 46:10.820]  they didn't say this is off record this is a private meeting you agree in
[46:10.820 --> 46:15.820]  confidence not to release it you've seen the famous footage at the RNC 2004 when
[46:15.820 --> 46:19.460]  I run into David Gergen in New York that's what I'm talking about Bohemian
[46:19.460 --> 46:22.980]  Grove he blows up and he goes you made an understanding because they'll kill you
[46:22.980 --> 46:27.140]  over that and then it's weird rules I'm not scared of them but I don't make an
[46:27.140 --> 46:30.620]  agreement to have a secret meeting with somebody and then release the details of
[46:30.620 --> 46:35.780]  who they are I will release what they said he said you had an understanding and
[46:35.780 --> 46:39.300]  I went no I'm the guy that snuck in he goes oh my gosh you're that guy and then
[46:39.300 --> 46:45.980]  he really blows up and gets in my face so the point I'm getting in here is this
[46:45.980 --> 46:50.420]  is very very real folks
[46:53.420 --> 46:59.660]  and this lady sold out and she's on a power trip she's an idiot but here are
[46:59.660 --> 47:04.020]  world leaders not just the mayor talking about the world government not rule of
[47:04.020 --> 47:10.220]  nations ruled by the UN the WHO now in charge of our lives just like that you
[47:10.220 --> 47:16.100]  see it's all real here it is we have before us the opportunity to forge for
[47:16.100 --> 47:22.100]  ourselves and for future generations a new world order a world for the rule of
[47:22.100 --> 47:29.180]  law not the law the jungle governs the conductive nations when we are successful
[47:29.180 --> 47:35.460]  and we will be we have a real chance at this new world order an order in which
[47:35.460 --> 47:40.980]  a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise
[47:40.980 --> 47:49.580]  and vision of the UN's founders it is a big idea a new world order a world in
[47:49.580 --> 47:55.140]  which there is the very real prospect of a new world order after 1989 president
[47:55.140 --> 48:00.020]  Bush kept said and it's a phrase that I often use myself that we needed a new
[48:00.020 --> 48:06.660]  world order there is a chance the president the United States to use this disaster to
[48:06.660 --> 48:11.860]  carry out what his father a phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't
[48:11.860 --> 48:15.580]  been used since and that is a new world order so that the problem of the Bush
[48:15.580 --> 48:21.820]  presidency will be the emergence of a new international order within the next
[48:21.820 --> 48:25.740]  four years we will see the emergence of a new international order the beginning
[48:25.740 --> 48:31.460]  of a new international order the pieces are in flux soon they will settle
[48:31.460 --> 48:40.620]  again before they do let us reorder this world around us I think his past will be
[48:40.620 --> 48:46.060]  to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new
[48:46.060 --> 48:51.980]  world order can be created it's a great opportunity and isn't that a crisis it's
[48:51.980 --> 48:57.460]  about the future of Europe and a new world order there's a need for new world
[48:57.460 --> 49:04.860]  order but it has different characteristics in different parts of of the
[49:04.860 --> 49:10.660]  world but today with Asia already out producing Europe India and China are
[49:10.660 --> 49:18.460]  clearly becoming part of our new order we are now facing a common challenge and
[49:18.460 --> 49:28.340]  the challenge is how to build a real door for the first time in history on a
[49:28.340 --> 49:35.540]  global basis so in conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is
[49:35.540 --> 49:43.060]  a new world order with significantly different and radically new challenges the
[49:43.060 --> 49:51.940]  affirmative task we have now is is to actually create a new world order
[49:51.940 --> 49:56.900]  good evening everybody President Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon today
[49:56.900 --> 50:02.380]  calling for a new world order to tackle our global economic crisis and the
[50:02.380 --> 50:06.660]  president outlined his vision of a new world order in which the US would
[50:06.660 --> 50:12.140]  participate fully we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world
[50:12.140 --> 50:15.900]  order that I think all of us would like to see so I see a world order in the
[50:15.900 --> 50:20.940]  future with a multi-polar world order I think the new world order is emerging
[50:20.940 --> 50:25.140]  and with it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international
[50:25.140 --> 50:31.260]  cooperation but in a globalized economy we are going to have to take global
[50:31.260 --> 50:34.700]  responsibilities and they're going to is going to have to be some
[50:34.700 --> 50:39.940]  several semblance of global governance never before has a new world order had
[50:39.940 --> 50:46.420]  to be assembled from so many different perceptions or on so global a scale nor
[50:46.420 --> 50:50.700]  has any previous order had to combine the attributes of the historic balance of
[50:50.700 --> 50:56.380]  power system with global democratic opinion and the exploding technology of
[50:56.380 --> 51:02.660]  the contemporary period and I surely believe India will be a central actor
[51:02.660 --> 51:08.380]  in the new world order there also exists an extraordinary opportunity to form
[51:08.380 --> 51:14.380]  for the first time in history a truly global society 2009 is also the first
[51:14.380 --> 51:18.620]  year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle
[51:18.620 --> 51:25.100]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step
[51:25.100 --> 51:28.780]  towards the global management of our planet new world order is the headline
[51:28.780 --> 51:33.260]  in the Globe and Mail in Canada is this global governance at last is it one
[51:33.260 --> 51:37.660]  world the central bankers in charge but aren't we all just living and dying for
[51:37.660 --> 51:41.580]  what the central banks do of course we are and we are absolutely slaves to
[51:41.580 --> 51:44.380]  central banks
[51:47.660 --> 51:53.540]  whether it's zoning buildings housing will be impacted by the planning
[51:53.540 --> 51:59.420]  certainly and it's in you and you pick the people to run those agencies and the
[51:59.420 --> 52:04.540]  deputies that are pledging allusions to the new world order and good governance
[52:04.540 --> 52:09.780]  and then I think you have the inspector general do some spotlights to make sure
[52:09.780 --> 52:18.220]  that with the executive branch the new world order and executive power the word
[52:18.220 --> 52:22.100]  dictator means dictate that means executive
[52:23.620 --> 52:29.220]  let me show you a really sick article from two days ago by George Soros Alex
[52:29.220 --> 52:33.460]  Jones claims frontline coronavirus health workers are killing patients for
[52:33.460 --> 52:38.740]  eugenics well what I said is the bioethics board set it up to say don't
[52:38.740 --> 52:41.740]  give them treatment and and they're putting people that have covered 19 in
[52:41.740 --> 52:45.100]  nursing homes knowing it'll kill a bunch of people to boost the numbers hell
[52:45.100 --> 52:49.660]  that's a big national scandal you and officials suggest lockdown should
[52:49.660 --> 52:58.060]  continue isn't that just special yes they never need to end but then you've
[52:58.060 --> 53:06.460]  got the Michigan governor right here dim governors keep sending COVID patients
[53:06.460 --> 53:11.500]  to nursing homes even though all the experts say don't do it but they got to
[53:11.500 --> 53:15.660]  get those death numbers up they got to create that fear that's why most all the
[53:15.660 --> 53:18.700]  deaths are old people because they're dying of other things they need them
[53:18.700 --> 53:22.380]  infected so they can say oh they tested positive because it's coming out they're
[53:22.380 --> 53:26.260]  saying everybody test positive when they're not this is a giant fraud a
[53:26.260 --> 53:30.740]  giant hoax oh but they told you you're a hero so you've got to go along with it
[53:30.740 --> 53:35.140]  while the whole economy completely breaks down and causes mass death I'm
[53:35.140 --> 53:40.140]  gonna go to break I'm not even scratch the surface of how loaded for bear we
[53:40.140 --> 53:43.740]  are today I'll tell you about the other big topics when we come back but this is

[57:56.380 --> 58:00.100]  went through it together oh then you learn ten years later your kid can't
[58:00.100 --> 58:08.460]  have children oh there's too many people anyways yeah let's go ahead and go to
[58:08.460 --> 58:11.260]  this report here it is
[58:13.180 --> 58:19.020]  Bill Gates says the only way to liberate the world from their self-quarantine is
[58:19.020 --> 58:25.020]  to be vaccinated the most urgent invention in the world right now is a
[58:25.020 --> 58:31.260]  vaccine that prevents you from getting COVID-19 it's gonna have to go to 7
[58:31.260 --> 58:36.220]  billion people that's how we're gonna end this pandemic President Trump has
[58:36.220 --> 58:43.020]  chosen a former executive of vaccine giant GlaxoSmithKline to run operation
[58:43.020 --> 58:49.740]  warp speed an operation to fast track a vaccine for COVID-19 Trump has
[58:49.740 --> 58:55.300]  announced that he is mobilizing the US military to deliver a coronavirus vaccine
[58:55.300 --> 58:58.900]  when it's ready I think we're gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year we're
[58:58.900 --> 59:03.180]  doing very well with a vaccine and I will tell you something I just literally
[59:03.180 --> 59:07.580]  left a meeting we're mobilizing our military and you know what stop the
[59:07.580 --> 59:13.060]  support because I went to a 20 seconds late we'll just come back next segment
[59:13.060 --> 59:18.180]  and play it let me just do this up I'd like to open the phones up the phones up
[59:18.180 --> 59:22.780]  for medical workers specifically because every time we open the phones up without
[59:22.780 --> 59:27.140]  even saying medical workers doctors nurses EMTs police officers calling and
[59:27.140 --> 59:31.700]  say yeah everybody says it's a hoax the hospitals empty any old person dies of
[59:31.700 --> 59:35.660]  you know heart disease whatever we say it's covered 19 that's all confirmed but
[59:35.660 --> 59:39.900]  I want to hear from you if you disagree with me we don't screen your call other
[59:39.900 --> 59:42.100]  than where you're calling from and you know basically what you want to talk
[59:42.100 --> 59:45.940]  about but we're screening calls is where they don't let you want to disagree with
[59:45.940 --> 59:50.900]  you I want to hear from you tell me everything's okay tell me I need this
[59:50.900 --> 59:55.500]  warp speed vaccine because it sounds like warp speed to death we're gonna come
[59:55.500 --> 59:59.460]  back in with air raid sirens that is customary for this crisis and we'll
[59:59.460 --> 1:00:06.380]  play this special report and then we're gonna get to Trump who's ongoing with
[1:00:06.380 --> 1:00:12.940]  Fauci up there in his bandit mask right now so medical workers or maybe you're
[1:00:12.940 --> 1:00:17.180]  a janitor at a hospital and it's empty you've got intel on it we want to hear
[1:00:17.180 --> 1:00:25.140]  from you specifically 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 and wait a few minutes till
[1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:28.020]  you call because I gotta turn the phone system on and get ready to take your
[1:00:28.020 --> 1:00:40.220]  calls but 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 and we'll get you up and on
[1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:46.860]  the air but my frustration is even up here trying to convince people of that
[1:00:46.860 --> 1:00:50.900]  this is a fraud this is a total fraud it's a total takeover I go on the
[1:00:50.900 --> 1:00:55.700]  hiking bike trail most mornings before I lift weights to walk three or four miles
[1:00:55.700 --> 1:00:59.980]  and you know the grown men especially you'll be on some 15 foot wide path they
[1:00:59.980 --> 1:01:04.700]  like get in the bushes and go now just go it's a kind of hoax but the
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:09.780]  depression is gonna be real you little hero but you know we've been too
[1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:14.180]  domesticated too long we're gonna get hurt really bad now but here's the
[1:01:14.180 --> 1:01:17.300]  problem used to we'd get attacked we wake up and fight back this is all
[1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:21.540]  creeping it's all done we're being a victims cool and being weak school so
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:24.500]  everybody's just kind of eased down you know people slit their wrists in hot
[1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:27.740]  water right because it doesn't hurt you just slit your wrist getting hot water
[1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:31.460]  and pretend you're not dying before you know you're dead and so that's just nice
[1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:35.700]  hot water you're all heroes to slit your wrist oh just be heroes oh there you
[1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:42.260]  almost put your kids in there with you oh liberal oh liberal because the
[1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:46.260]  globalists need to urge for themselves and they've got all the monuments planned
[1:01:46.260 --> 1:01:51.980]  everything for after you're all dead big victory celebration when you're all dead
[1:01:54.900 --> 1:02:00.620]  make a friend with death it's a saying so old that no one knows who first said
[1:02:00.620 --> 1:02:06.780]  every culture has their own way of memorializing that simple statement but
[1:02:06.780 --> 1:02:11.460]  you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of
[1:02:11.460 --> 1:02:17.500]  human species the moment of truth is now here we are facing the post-human era
[1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:22.580]  I've been warning you for many years they would use a global viral crisis to
[1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:28.860]  click put us in the cage and then roll out the robot takeover this is just the
[1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:34.860]  beta test China is moving out of beta and into operational control in just a
[1:02:34.860 --> 1:02:40.020]  few years we will be under full the globalist control forced inoculations
[1:02:40.020 --> 1:02:44.780]  total surveillance we're all being taught that we are obsolete the term they use
[1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:51.300]  is non-essential this is not some dystopian novel this is reality this
[1:02:51.300 --> 1:03:11.740]  is the new world order this is satanism
[1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:17.820]  Bill Gates says the only way to liberate the world from their self-quarantine
[1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:24.140]  is to be vaccinated the most urgent invention in the world right now is a
[1:03:24.140 --> 1:03:30.420]  vaccine that prevents you from getting COVID-19 it's gonna have to go to 7
[1:03:30.420 --> 1:03:35.340]  billion people that's how we're gonna end this pandemic President Trump has
[1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:42.140]  chosen a former executive of vaccine giant GlaxoSmithKline to run operation
[1:03:42.140 --> 1:03:49.220]  warp speed an operation to fast track a vaccine for COVID-19 Trump has announced
[1:03:49.220 --> 1:03:54.980]  that he is mobilizing the US military to deliver a coronavirus vaccine when
[1:03:54.980 --> 1:03:58.020]  it's ready I think we're gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year we're
[1:03:58.020 --> 1:04:02.540]  doing very well with a vaccine and I will tell you something I just literally
[1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:07.140]  left a meeting we're mobilizing our military and other forces but we're
[1:04:07.140 --> 1:04:11.980]  mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine you know it's
[1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:17.500]  a massive job to give this vaccine our military is now being mobilized so at
[1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.980]  the end of the year we're gonna be able to give it to a lot of people very very
[1:04:20.980 --> 1:04:25.740]  rapidly according to the Department of Defense they will have enough vaccines
[1:04:25.740 --> 1:04:33.740]  for everyone in America HR 6666 is setting up a national contact tracer
[1:04:33.740 --> 1:04:41.500]  army we need a national core of healthy people who are probably trying to go out
[1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:47.860]  and do this contact tracer hi yeah I got a couple handshakers right in front of
[1:04:47.860 --> 1:04:52.940]  me okay sir are they still in the city yeah I'm staring at them right now
[1:04:56.020 --> 1:04:59.780]  I noticed that in the United States there are some netizens who even attacked you
[1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:04.980]  shopping those are totally Bill Gates is given a platform in communist China to
[1:05:04.980 --> 1:05:09.820]  defend himself I'd say it's an ironic if you take somebody who's doing their
[1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:15.300]  best to get the world ready and you know putting in my case billions of
[1:05:15.300 --> 1:05:20.900]  dollars into these tools for infectious diseases we're in a crazy situation so
[1:05:20.900 --> 1:05:25.540]  there's going to be crazy rumors former intelligence officer Jack Pasobic
[1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:31.260]  defends Bill Gates and encourages his Twitter followers to focus on China and
[1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:37.020]  senator Lindsey Graham repeats this sentiment as well going so far as to
[1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:42.980]  say he would hire Bill Gates to run the WHO and double their funding I'm in
[1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:47.540]  charge of the appropriations over the WHO at least a part of it and what I
[1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:51.300]  want to see a change of leadership because I think they conspired with China
[1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:57.860]  to downplay the the nature of the virus the WHO has great scientists but his
[1:05:57.860 --> 1:06:02.660]  lost confidence I've lost confidence in the leadership so a guy like Bill Gates
[1:06:02.660 --> 1:06:08.060]  that Bill Gates was in charge of the WHO I would double the funding because I
[1:06:08.060 --> 1:06:12.700]  think we need a WHO but he's not the vaccine they are planning to give
[1:06:12.700 --> 1:06:19.060]  everyone on earth is an experimental mRNA vaccine that will alter our DNA
[1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:25.300]  forever and if this experimental vaccine actually works it will be the first ever
[1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:31.620]  in history to do so welcome to the new world order and you pick the people to
[1:06:31.620 --> 1:06:37.020]  run those agencies and the deputies they're pledging allegiance to the new
[1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:43.140]  world order and good governance for info wars.com this is Greg Rees
[1:06:43.140 --> 1:06:52.860]  info wars tomorrow's news today we're taking calls from frontline health
[1:06:52.860 --> 1:06:58.980]  responders doctors nurses EMTs because we just open the phones up regularly and
[1:06:58.980 --> 1:07:03.580]  all these callers call in who are doctors and nurses saying it's a total
[1:07:03.580 --> 1:07:06.940]  hoax total fraud you're totally empty somebody comes in that has the sniffles
[1:07:06.940 --> 1:07:11.740]  and dies of a heart attack he says COVID-19 no test that's all confirmed
[1:07:11.740 --> 1:07:21.020]  877-789-2539 877-789 Alex and we're taking your phone calls on this
[1:07:21.020 --> 1:07:25.220]  incredibly important subject but let's go to Trump who's been doing a press
[1:07:25.220 --> 1:07:28.220]  conference the last 30 minutes it's still on going right now with Fauci
[1:07:28.220 --> 1:07:37.380]  looking like Billy the Kid bandit meets a executioner back there with him and
[1:07:37.380 --> 1:07:41.300]  there's Trump saying we're getting this vaccine sped up because he wants hope he
[1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:44.060]  wants the economy to turn back on he understands it'll be a global depression
[1:07:44.060 --> 1:07:47.100]  hundreds of millions of die so Trump's like hell by the time the vaccine's out
[1:07:47.100 --> 1:07:51.220]  it'll be another subject I don't want Fauci and the UN running it I don't want
[1:07:51.220 --> 1:07:54.500]  the Clintons running it so Trump's like oh have the military do it I know what
[1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:58.460]  Trump's doing but still it's a very very dangerous game here's the president
[1:07:58.460 --> 1:08:03.980]  promising and they're working to narrow that list still further so we started off
[1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:09.900]  with over a hundred we're down to 14 and we have some really interesting choices
[1:08:09.900 --> 1:08:13.740]  to be made they're doing very well through operation warp speed the federal
[1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:19.620]  government is providing unprecedented support and resources to safely
[1:08:19.620 --> 1:08:27.540]  expedite the trials moving on at record record record speed but let's pause
[1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:32.460]  yeah our bill of rights the Constitution and due process is all dying at warp
[1:08:32.460 --> 1:08:39.180]  speed and medical tyranny is coming down on us right now at warp speed so this is
[1:08:39.180 --> 1:08:43.980]  the new old order at warp speed that I mean that's what all this is and look at
[1:08:43.980 --> 1:08:51.300]  Fauci look he looks if they've had a new Star Wars and the McDermott the guy that
[1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:56.740]  plays the Emperor dies we have the new Emperor I mean he looks and and remember
[1:08:56.740 --> 1:09:01.700]  it's the UN it's the globalist it's Fauci it's the Bill Monagates that are
[1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:06.940]  running Wuhan and funding it on record and then oh the totally compromised
[1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:12.820]  senator Graham though oh he likes Bill Gates oh I love him too oh here's the
[1:09:12.820 --> 1:09:20.500]  president vaccine trials operation warp speed will be simultaneously accelerating
[1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:24.620]  it's manufacturing and manufacturing process in other words we're getting
[1:09:24.620 --> 1:09:31.140]  ready so that when we get the good word that we have a dog we have the formula
[1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:36.540]  we have what we need we're ready to go as opposed to taking years to gear up
[1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:43.700]  we're gearing up it's risky it's expensive but we'll be saving massive
[1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:48.420]  amounts of time we'll be saving years you know if we big farm is a criminal
[1:09:48.420 --> 1:09:52.260]  group we all know that we're gearing up on the assumption that we'll have they're
[1:09:52.260 --> 1:09:56.620]  just taking over in the near future relatively a mafia man a vaccine
[1:09:56.620 --> 1:10:03.060]  typically pharmaceutical companies wait to manufacture a vaccine a vaccine
[1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:08.980]  you know that little demon Fauci has not said one thing about vitamin D3 about
[1:10:08.980 --> 1:10:12.540]  vitamin C about zinc when all the studies are there that if people just
[1:10:12.540 --> 1:10:15.900]  had a jumbo dose of that you're basically impregnable that they're
[1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:19.660]  trying to make it illegal because they want your ass dead this is the clamp
[1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:24.340]  down folks I cannot believe how pathetic this is let's go back to this
[1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:29.500]  piece of filth I'm talking about Fauci approval is necessary and this can delay
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:33.460]  vaccines availability to the public as much as a year and even more than that
[1:10:33.460 --> 1:10:39.180]  however our task is so urgent that under operation warp speed oh boy the
[1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:43.860]  federal government will invest in manufacturing all of the top vaccine
[1:10:43.860 --> 1:10:48.340]  candidates before they're approved so we're knowing exactly what we're doing
[1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:53.380]  before they're approved it pause that means so Trump's talking about ludicrous
[1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:59.660]  speed directly out of space balls now folks I mean and again I get what
[1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:03.020]  Trump's doing he's taking control from them he know Bill among the gates and
[1:11:03.020 --> 1:11:06.660]  the Clinton initiative is running this so by him doing this he thinks that you
[1:11:06.660 --> 1:11:09.620]  know it's good for poll numbers and people won't remember this next week no
[1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:14.940]  this is dangerous continue up with a good vaccine because we're ready to
[1:11:14.940 --> 1:11:19.660]  deliver it this will eliminate any unnecessary delay and enable us to begin
[1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:24.300]  providing Americans with a proven vaccine today our scientists say we're
[1:11:24.300 --> 1:11:29.980]  ready we got it and as we work to bring critical medical a national emergency
[1:11:29.980 --> 1:11:33.380]  lets them have human trials before animal trials which they skipped and allows
[1:11:33.380 --> 1:11:37.240]  them to declare an emergency and indemnify it so Trump is taking a hook
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:43.300]  line sinker just like 15 years ago Governor Rick Perry did yeah we've got
[1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:48.540]  ludicrous speed for you next segment where he said oh Gardasil's mandated under
[1:11:48.540 --> 1:11:53.700]  an emergency so it skipped trials and killed a bunch of people but let's just
[1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:56.860]  come back with this we'll just come back with more of this nightmare and then
[1:11:56.860 --> 1:12:00.940]  despite Trump going oh vaccines new world order I was watching it in the
[1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:04.260]  lifetime I got a cup of coffee during the last break that they like pull their
[1:12:04.260 --> 1:12:08.580]  mask down and go ah you suck ah the next person does that I mean this is just
[1:12:08.580 --> 1:12:14.020]  pathetic man hey don't worry though they've announced Joe Biden's gonna step
[1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:18.540]  down at the national convention and Hillary will run again with Obama and
[1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:26.660]  serve EP will probably get them to you know America has some good people left
[1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:33.060]  in it but there are a lot of evil people man and all you dumbasses and serve the
[1:12:33.060 --> 1:12:36.540]  system you're so stupid that when you lose everything you'll still won't even
[1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:40.020]  get how you got screwed let's look at that Fauci though that is a little
[1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:44.460]  predator man that guy is an enemy of humanity if they're ever look at that
[1:12:44.460 --> 1:12:51.860]  snake-eyed demon burning hell Fauci you fraud you little piece of garbage it
[1:12:51.860 --> 1:12:55.780]  took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the
[1:12:55.780 --> 1:13:00.900]  world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as
[1:13:00.900 --> 1:13:05.500]  this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:10.100]  the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world and
[1:13:10.100 --> 1:13:13.900]  that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:19.460]  they're not gonna have medical ID cards forced inoculation we are now in a
[1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:24.820]  giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major back
[1:13:24.820 --> 1:13:29.940]  lash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of
[1:13:29.940 --> 1:13:34.660]  rights rediscover our Constitution in our backbone and start saying no to
[1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:38.820]  people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut
[1:13:38.820 --> 1:13:43.220]  your life down it'll save lives no it's caused millions to already starve to
[1:13:43.220 --> 1:13:46.620]  death tens of millions more so the cowards you went along with us with
[1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.660]  your virtue signaling you have destroyed your lives and our lives
[1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:54.700]  congratulations I'm always excited about in fours life products they're amazing
[1:13:54.700 --> 1:13:57.820]  they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they find the info war in
[1:13:57.820 --> 1:14:02.900]  the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over
[1:14:02.900 --> 1:14:10.340]  a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the
[1:14:10.340 --> 1:14:16.140]  market with organic essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation
[1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:23.500]  it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's
[1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:27.100]  high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way I like to put on my
[1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:31.620]  hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it
[1:14:31.620 --> 1:14:35.300]  on your eyes but I just love it personally it's something that's a
[1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:39.620]  moisturizer as well so this is a real innovation I don't know why others didn't
[1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:43.220]  think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential
[1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:48.740]  oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so refreshing this is a
[1:14:48.740 --> 1:14:51.100]  big winner
[1:14:51.100 --> 1:14:59.460]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:22.060]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones listen to these
[1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:26.540]  incredible callers every one of which I totally respect but to get to everybody
[1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:30.260]  we've only got to give each person about two minutes Jeremy in Texas family

[1:15:58.860 --> 1:16:04.180]  hospitals Carlos in Texas medical nurse hospitals empty hoax hysteria Scotty

[1:16:08.540 --> 1:16:14.580]  COVID-19 info and again folks I know the globalist hate Trump and I know he's
[1:16:14.580 --> 1:16:19.660]  done a lot of amazing things and I know he had two different board members the
[1:16:19.660 --> 1:16:26.260]  NRA call me and say listen just don't say the board members are but the
[1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:29.620]  strategy is we're gonna tell the Democrats okay yeah what do you want and
[1:16:29.620 --> 1:16:34.140]  they're gonna call for gun confiscation and that's gonna destroy their plan so
[1:16:34.140 --> 1:16:40.820]  when the president says okay I'm for gun control he's not for it he's just he's
[1:16:40.820 --> 1:16:44.540]  getting him to out themselves well I went on air and told that story and
[1:16:44.540 --> 1:16:49.140]  listeners got pissed at me but you notice no gun control it worked he's doing that
[1:16:49.140 --> 1:16:52.260]  again he's taking control of Fauci and them going out there with their
[1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:57.220]  propaganda knowing people won't remember in a month I still think it's super
[1:16:57.220 --> 1:17:02.580]  dangerous look I know what Trump's doing it's still a very dangerous game
[1:17:02.580 --> 1:17:08.980]  regardless I don't just get up here and say something to hoax they admit because
[1:17:08.980 --> 1:17:12.820]  they don't want to go to jail for fraud Fauci and all of them that they're
[1:17:12.820 --> 1:17:17.420]  counting all the deaths as COVID and you look at the graph of normal deaths that
[1:17:17.420 --> 1:17:22.620]  that's what the graph is there this is huge folks it doesn't mean if you're old
[1:17:22.620 --> 1:17:25.980]  and you're debilitated you don't have a vitamin D3 or zinc that you could die
[1:17:25.980 --> 1:17:31.340]  from this absolutely you can die from a cold but this is a power grab where now
[1:17:31.340 --> 1:17:35.300]  as the testing goes up more people are finding they haven't and meat packing
[1:17:35.300 --> 1:17:39.980]  plants if two people get it they're shutting down the plant warehouses that
[1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:48.140]  deliver our goods if they get one person in a warehouse of 50 people they're
[1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:53.180]  closing the warehouses that's why I've got stacks of news about beef rotting
[1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:58.780]  pork rotting poultry fish there's no one there
[1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:08.020]  I'm on the phone with people I paid for product three months ago that's a month
[1:18:08.020 --> 1:18:11.140]  late getting here and I'm like where's my supplements they're like our warehouses
[1:18:11.140 --> 1:18:14.940]  shut down one one guy had it I go did they die no they're fine but everyone's
[1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:21.900]  on quarantine 14 days China's not on lockdown why do you think all this stuff
[1:18:21.900 --> 1:18:28.780]  works folks it's all being shut down it's an attack it's an economic attack so
[1:18:28.780 --> 1:18:31.940]  out of one side of his mouth Trump's like turn it all back on you know it's BS
[1:18:31.940 --> 1:18:35.340]  other side don't worry I got a vaccine it's coming the army will deliver it
[1:18:35.340 --> 1:18:39.580]  because he knows the Clintons and the UN are planning to be the savior so
[1:18:39.580 --> 1:18:45.500]  Trump's heading them off I know what Trump's doing I disagree with it this is
[1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:49.020]  not leveling with people about what the globalists are doing level about the
[1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:53.860]  scam Trump tell folks gut it up and stop acting like this don't say oh I've got
[1:18:53.860 --> 1:19:00.140]  the vaccine so that you're in control of the screw job all right I'm gonna go to
[1:19:00.140 --> 1:19:07.460]  your calls who should we go to first who's been holding the longest
[1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:14.100]  let's go ahead and talk to Carlos in Texas medical nurse go ahead tells
[1:19:14.100 --> 1:19:19.380]  what's happening hello mr. Jones how are you doing I'm completely freaked out so
[1:19:19.380 --> 1:19:24.060]  I'm not doing well I'm here I'm here yeah well you know I'm a nurse I work for
[1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:29.340]  one of the biggest hospitals in Dallas and yeah this COVID-19 stuff is just a
[1:19:29.340 --> 1:19:35.260]  big lie you know in my hospital they have empty two floors because we have no
[1:19:35.260 --> 1:19:40.740]  patients they have also cut my hours I'm working three days a week instead of
[1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:46.420]  four and it's just that you know they just people are scared people are waiting
[1:19:46.420 --> 1:19:52.500]  for the second wave here it comes but you'll be ready and meanwhile you know
[1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:57.300]  nobody knows anything about supplements vitamins and all these that could help
[1:19:57.300 --> 1:20:03.060]  you you know fight and could help you prevent you're in the virus also you
[1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:07.780]  know I'm just amazed by all these people wearing masks and wearing gloves when
[1:20:07.780 --> 1:20:12.100]  they go to the supermarket and they're wearing the same glove touching
[1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:16.420]  everything touching themselves all this cross-contamination going on and they
[1:20:16.420 --> 1:20:21.460]  explain that to them the studies show unless you change gloves during every
[1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:26.220]  procedure they're worse than skin they make it worse don't they yeah yeah in
[1:20:26.220 --> 1:20:32.780]  about 10 hours I usually use 100 100 pairs of gloves you have to change it
[1:20:32.780 --> 1:20:36.260]  every single time you do something you cannot just wear the same glove and do
[1:20:36.260 --> 1:20:40.060]  everything it doesn't have a protective shield you don't have anything like that
[1:20:40.060 --> 1:20:44.740]  you know you're gonna change them constantly and just people going to the
[1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:47.940]  supermarket and wearing gloves you know they're yeah they think it's keeping it
[1:20:47.940 --> 1:20:50.700]  from going through their skin they don't get it's to keep them from spreading it
[1:20:50.700 --> 1:20:55.220]  so every time you leave the operatory or the surgery area you've got to change
[1:20:55.220 --> 1:20:58.260]  them they don't even know this they just think like oh I'm wearing people wear
[1:20:58.260 --> 1:21:05.420]  leather gloves and they're like oh I'm wearing what the hell are you doing yeah
[1:21:05.420 --> 1:21:08.620]  yeah understand you know they don't make any sense but hey I just want to say
[1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:12.420]  that man I just feel people out there just not to freak out everything is fine
[1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:16.220]  you know exactly Carlos God bless you you know they've got media matters out
[1:21:16.220 --> 1:21:19.620]  saying that I said all nurses are frauds and killing people I didn't say that I
[1:21:19.620 --> 1:21:24.580]  said Democrats putting COVID patients in nursing homes is is a death sentence
[1:21:24.580 --> 1:21:28.700]  is killing people and that the and that the nursing homes are where the real
[1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:33.540]  death is and that most of the real corruptions going on at hospitals that
[1:21:33.540 --> 1:21:38.340]  are getting the money to say that people have COVID that don't and that's the
[1:21:38.340 --> 1:21:41.660]  reality that's what's coming out thank you Carlos okay let's talk to Tom in
[1:21:41.660 --> 1:21:48.140]  Texas police officer wife's a nurse what's your view on this welcome thank you
[1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:51.860]  go ahead yes they're good to talk to you I've been trying to get on the show and
[1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:58.420]  report my news for a few weeks now I'm a officer here in North Texas and my wife
[1:21:58.420 --> 1:22:06.940]  says a George nurse and a major hospital and since about eight weeks they sent her
[1:22:06.940 --> 1:22:14.220]  whole entire unit home she works in the ICU ICU unit primarily they have her
[1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:20.820]  entering so she's that's all she's done they shut down her floor nobody's there
[1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:27.460]  I've been pulling security at hospitals the places are empty with my wife
[1:22:27.460 --> 1:22:36.060]  working from home I see her computer I see the documents 99% of people have no
[1:22:36.060 --> 1:22:41.380]  COVID signs and the ones that do they always say with COVID not of COVID
[1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:46.420]  whatever Trump and I you know I have my issues with Trump but whatever him and
[1:22:46.420 --> 1:22:51.300]  Fauci are at they're putting out they're not telling the truth the people on the
[1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:55.100]  street the callers that are calling in right now we all see what's going on and
[1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:59.540]  they're not reporting facts don't hang up Tom I'm gonna come back to you don't
[1:22:59.540 --> 1:23:03.580]  you'd have a chance to repeat all this to get more into this but it's not what
[1:23:03.580 --> 1:23:08.380]  you're saying and I believe you we have the numbers we know they admit that
[1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:13.140]  this is all going on but you said something so key I just got chills the
[1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:19.020]  ICUs are empty and so what happens is and I've talked to medical doctors are
[1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:22.020]  scared to come on one of them is very close to me in Texas I'll leave it at
[1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:26.300]  that all these people are dying from not getting medical care and then when they
[1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:30.340]  come in later they're saying COVID-19 when they die at home so the hospitals
[1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:34.300]  are not given care to all these people and then when they die they call them
[1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:39.060]  COVID when they come in man this is evil stay there Tom we'll come back have
[1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:44.100]  you recap all that this is a reality folks these are live phones we're not
[1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:46.940]  screening these calls if somebody calls in and says their hospitals full have them
[1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:51.780]  on they don't call because it's not going on the America that we've known
[1:23:51.780 --> 1:23:55.060]  and loved the America that was the land of the free home of the brave is dying
[1:23:55.060 --> 1:24:00.100]  right now and everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us
[1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:05.380]  shutting us down and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the
[1:24:05.380 --> 1:24:09.100]  depression is going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too
[1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:13.020]  late now even turn back Trump tried to stop it but the mainstream media working
[1:24:13.020 --> 1:24:17.380]  with the tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else has to get
[1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:21.780]  prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic

[1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:53.380]  infoorstore.com I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy
[1:24:53.380 --> 1:24:57.700]  slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred
[1:24:57.700 --> 1:25:01.340]  yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said well
[1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:05.100]  yeah when I grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the
[1:25:05.100 --> 1:25:09.620]  street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in
[1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:13.820]  the head had blood pouring out a huge hole he was holding it he walked around
[1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:19.140]  gibbering talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead well
[1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:23.820]  that's what's going to happen with our economy it is in cardiac arrest this has
[1:25:23.820 --> 1:25:28.740]  been done by design and the UN the tricombs the mainstream media orchestrated
[1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:33.700]  it hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed so remember the depression
[1:25:33.700 --> 1:25:37.780]  that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN on Bill and
[1:25:37.780 --> 1:25:43.260]  Melinda Gates on Obama on Hillary on Biden on the Democrats we tried to stop

[1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:30.060]  numbers are all public I remember three months ago people go out to these
[1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:35.140]  hospitals they'd be totally empty and then we notice like for three days or be
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:39.300]  no one going in the citizens went out there and staked it out they care they're
[1:27:39.300 --> 1:27:43.300]  like they hear on the news whether it's Texas or New York or Florida or
[1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:47.980]  California that it's totally full they go down nobody's there and then all the
[1:27:47.980 --> 1:27:51.540]  south there'd be like 20 people that has match suits and a bunch of cars and film
[1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:54.820]  crews directing them and anybody can see somebody directing somebody well
[1:27:54.820 --> 1:27:59.820]  project Veritas got the footage with the insiders going yeah nobody's here so
[1:27:59.820 --> 1:28:08.260]  the hospital ordered us to stage this with CBS and then NBC gets caught
[1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:12.700]  editing out where the attorney general says yeah I care about the rule law I
[1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:18.020]  believe the American people and the Chuck Todd goes yeah he said nothing about
[1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:22.980]  the rule law here's his tape these people lie so Tom go back to what you were
[1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:26.620]  saying recap it and and what is it like for you to discover this or other
[1:28:26.620 --> 1:28:30.820]  police officers waking up what are the nurses that know your wife what are
[1:28:30.820 --> 1:28:35.940]  they saying well the quick recap of the story is I'm a PD officer here in North
[1:28:35.940 --> 1:28:43.060]  Texas my wife's a charge nurse for a major hospital and she like I said charge
[1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:51.060]  nurse runs her unit they sent her unit home basically everybody got scared so
[1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:55.340]  half of them quit the ones that stayed they sent home and they shut down the
[1:28:55.340 --> 1:28:58.220]  floor that they were working on literally turn the lights off and lock the
[1:28:58.220 --> 1:29:04.100]  doors we saw this I've been pulling security because our PD is providing
[1:29:04.100 --> 1:29:07.940]  that and I'm doing it you know donating my time and everything else I've seen
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:12.660]  the camera footage of this myself as well as the medical reports coming in
[1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:18.740]  because she is home basically they call her to how much you know medicine do we
[1:29:18.740 --> 1:29:22.220]  give this person which you come into the yard that's basically what she's done
[1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:26.900]  for the last six to eight weeks the numbers they're throwing out for COVID
[1:29:26.900 --> 1:29:33.260]  patients just in Texas alone or bull their lives they are so inflated even
[1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:38.580]  the testing no two testing reports are anywhere near the same there are no
[1:29:38.580 --> 1:29:43.700]  similarities I can't reveal I wish I could post in a real what I know but if
[1:29:43.700 --> 1:29:48.940]  I did I would get so many people in trouble and it would violate HIPAA right
[1:29:48.940 --> 1:29:53.180]  but here's the problem now big tech is just violate HIPAA they've been giving
[1:29:53.180 --> 1:29:56.900]  all the HIPAA files are doing it outside of law so we all follow along which is
[1:29:56.900 --> 1:30:07.060]  good they don't that's like I said it's my wife got sick about five and a half
[1:30:07.060 --> 1:30:12.300]  weeks ago so we like sometimes I freaked out because we have three little kids
[1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:18.940]  you know I didn't know at the time if this was real or if it was not so you
[1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:25.660]  know of course we got scared but she was we did the vitamin CD and zinc because
[1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:29.420]  we had there's a doctor at the hospital he's done doctors without borders and
[1:30:29.420 --> 1:30:35.060]  everything else he pulled me to the side said look just treat her this way don't
[1:30:35.060 --> 1:30:39.940]  don't bring her into this hospital you don't even come here within two days of
[1:30:39.940 --> 1:30:45.180]  those three things everything was fine like she was brand new in that great
[1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:48.940]  though there's still doctors that do their job right well that's what I'm
[1:30:48.940 --> 1:30:53.860]  saying this guy he's he's been to Africa you know he people these people want to
[1:30:53.860 --> 1:30:57.940]  talk about helping the poor Africans this guy's actually been there he pulled
[1:30:57.940 --> 1:31:04.100]  me to the side and told me this intel and the things I've seen the things I
[1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:08.980]  know would shock most people and I'm sure there's a lot of other colors who
[1:31:08.980 --> 1:31:15.020]  have similar stories and similar intel one day all this information will come
[1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:22.140]  out and this is the start of the new world order this is the 666 mark of the
[1:31:22.140 --> 1:31:26.540]  beast you better pray up people you better be prepared because I'm telling
[1:31:26.540 --> 1:31:29.940]  you do not take anything from gates don't take his shots don't take his
[1:31:29.940 --> 1:31:33.660]  poison because you take that mark of your soul will go to hell look at that
[1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:37.140]  man that's the scary part is they're up front saying this may really hurt you I
[1:31:37.140 --> 1:31:40.740]  mean they're not even lying about it hurt you now they're saying you want to
[1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:43.580]  leave your house or have a job you take this and by the way it may hurt you
[1:31:43.580 --> 1:31:48.940]  sign this form waving your rights boy you know to grab both butt cheeks when
[1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:54.780]  they're doing that now it's time to fall on your knees and pray to God ask him
[1:31:54.780 --> 1:31:58.300]  to forgive you of what you've done and to save your soul and I'm not talking
[1:31:58.300 --> 1:32:01.780]  just showing no it's true we've been evil and that's why this is happening yes
[1:32:01.780 --> 1:32:07.260]  we have killed millions of innocents in this in this nation and God has
[1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:11.740]  punished in us for this damn right what is doing it that's exactly where it is
[1:32:11.740 --> 1:32:16.820]  God bless you brother go it sorry sir yeah I was talking over you go at what
[1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:25.820]  you're saying sorry he's gone he says I'm not in force and by the way everything
[1:32:25.820 --> 1:32:30.380]  that guy's saying is all admitted I mean that's what's so crazy about this is
[1:32:30.380 --> 1:32:34.940]  that they're counting every death for anybody that's ever had a cold virus
[1:32:34.940 --> 1:32:40.900]  that shows up in your body is COVID-19 that's a good cold virus and they're
[1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:47.860]  using it for total control and by the way there was a really bad pneumonia virus
[1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:53.020]  the last six months I haven't had a fever in five years I got one a lot of
[1:32:53.020 --> 1:32:56.660]  folks I know were really sick it was back in November December January and we
[1:32:56.660 --> 1:33:01.340]  said hey looks like it was already here we had Steve Pachett high-level State
[1:33:01.340 --> 1:33:04.940]  Department CIA he said look it's been here for six months that was four months
[1:33:04.940 --> 1:33:08.620]  ago turns out that's all true so they already knew this was here they already
[1:33:08.620 --> 1:33:12.260]  know most of us have herd immunity or most of us already had it but see when
[1:33:12.260 --> 1:33:16.300]  they test you for it now it creates a panic and it shuts down your businesses
[1:33:16.300 --> 1:33:21.340]  which kills the economy and that's what they're doing so it's a real virus folks
[1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:27.900]  but if you've got vitamin D vitamin C and zinc in about three to five times the
[1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:37.100]  level you're impregnable but zinc at that level is toxic to your kidneys so it's
[1:33:37.100 --> 1:33:41.580]  it's a give-and-take situation I mean the truth is and I'm not a medical
[1:33:41.580 --> 1:33:45.020]  doctor and I'm not giving advice me personally when I've read you take ten
[1:33:45.020 --> 1:33:48.660]  times the normal level of zinc it'll make your hair fall out but you're not
[1:33:48.660 --> 1:33:52.700]  getting COVID-19 or any other cold virus I mean it's like just the dog
[1:33:52.700 --> 1:33:58.460]  doesn't hunt but long-term it'll eat your kidneys so let's go ahead and take
[1:33:58.460 --> 1:34:05.740]  another call here let's go ahead and talk to Brian in Pennsylvania analysts at
[1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:09.820]  health insurance company insurance companies in South Africa say that 29
[1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:15.580]  times the death from the lockdown versus the virus Brian what do you know yeah
[1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:18.940]  let's get to talk he thanks for taking my call I just wanted to hit a couple
[1:34:18.940 --> 1:34:24.820]  different points but the main point is that it seems that at least at the very
[1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:31.220]  high level this whole response at least from the insurance companies you know
[1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:36.180]  longevity and continuation of the business had been wargamed out and I
[1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:40.540]  have a couple reasons why I think that was probably the case oh it's all
[1:34:40.540 --> 1:34:44.380]  scripted it's all choreographed worldwide yet but from your own
[1:34:44.380 --> 1:34:51.980]  perspective tell us yeah so beginning last year around the holidays so this
[1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:56.900]  was before even the news broke about what was happening in Wuhan there was a
[1:34:56.900 --> 1:35:02.420]  big push for everyone basically at the ground level to make sure that they
[1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:07.700]  start booking their time off early next year which I thought was strange they
[1:35:07.700 --> 1:35:13.700]  had basically created a new branch of artificial intelligence automated
[1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:20.180]  learning with its own chains of management and reporting I you know even
[1:35:20.180 --> 1:35:26.700]  more recently and this is continuing there was basically a war game to
[1:35:26.700 --> 1:35:32.900]  establish a plan of action should a lot of the Medicare Medicaid government
[1:35:32.900 --> 1:35:39.660]  services provider groups become insolvent and what a crazy thing to plan
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:46.060]  for right and that was being planned for the second half of last year this is
[1:35:46.060 --> 1:35:50.460]  incredible you're saying you were seeing war games for industry collapse you've
[1:35:50.460 --> 1:35:56.620]  never seen that before exactly they were wargaming for losing large amounts of
[1:35:56.620 --> 1:36:02.220]  provider groups in the small to medium-sized range to become insolvent
[1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:07.540]  gaming for a vertical integration essentially yes but they called it
[1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:14.620]  streamlining for efficiency and part of that if you could believe that they're
[1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:20.140]  predicting now that they're going to actually issue loans interest-free loan
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:25.180]  through the provider group and they're expecting up to 20 to 30 percent will
[1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:31.780]  default so the CEO comes out as the new normal this is new normal all the middle
[1:36:31.780 --> 1:36:35.180]  upper management is parroting that stay there we're gonna come back to you Brian
[1:36:35.180 --> 1:36:40.420]  an artificially instituted global bankruptcy vertical integration Brian
[1:36:40.420 --> 1:36:43.700]  when Pennsylvania will finish up these are the incredible colors we've got I'm
[1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:48.060]  so blessed to have amazing listeners like you that will battle to get on and
[1:36:48.060 --> 1:36:52.860]  hold and vitamin mineral fusion is one of our best-selling products it wasn't
[1:36:52.860 --> 1:36:56.500]  always that way we hardly ever promoted we first launched a few years ago but
[1:36:56.500 --> 1:37:01.780]  people slowly began to try it and almost everyone that orders it reorders it
[1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:08.340]  that's why we're offering it right now at m4slife.com at 50% off even though
[1:37:08.340 --> 1:37:12.180]  we're about to sell out because I want people who've been on the fence who've
[1:37:12.180 --> 1:37:15.460]  heard us talk about it who've read some of the reviews to experience it for
[1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:18.900]  yourself and this is important it's not just all the key vitamins and minerals
[1:37:18.900 --> 1:37:23.500]  you need it's also got amino acids that are known to help you absorb more of
[1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:27.180]  this into your body and that's really important for folks that are older
[1:37:27.180 --> 1:37:32.700]  because a lot of people don't absorb vitamins and minerals in pill form or
[1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:36.860]  capitol form but they get a higher absorption rate when it's liquid so
[1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:40.980]  this powdered formula goes great into water into other juices it's good for
[1:37:40.980 --> 1:37:44.500]  adults it's good for children take advantage of this super sale that's

[1:38:48.940 --> 1:38:54.340]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[1:38:54.340 --> 1:38:59.620]  when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart
[1:38:59.620 --> 1:39:05.900]  they'll still run 50 60 70 maybe a hundred yards they've got that adrenaline
[1:39:05.900 --> 1:39:09.740]  pumping through their arteries and through their veins but all the sudden
[1:39:09.740 --> 1:39:14.220]  they slow down they realize what's happened they fall over and they die
[1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:19.580]  then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's gonna happen to
[1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:24.980]  the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that we've
[1:39:24.980 --> 1:39:29.580]  been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's gonna mean a long
[1:39:29.580 --> 1:39:33.980]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's gonna mean
[1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:36.540]  probably over a hundred million debt according to you and I believe their
[1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:41.220]  numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the
[1:39:41.220 --> 1:39:44.420]  third world so that all the leftists had thought it was their revolution to get
[1:39:44.420 --> 1:39:47.580]  rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger

[1:41:20.540 --> 1:41:29.980]  we are back live I'm your host Alex Jones we have Laura Loomer running for
[1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:34.740]  Congress and a head in major polls in Florida popping in for two segments but
[1:41:34.740 --> 1:41:38.380]  I'm gonna continue on to the fourth hour with phone calls we're taking your phone
[1:41:38.380 --> 1:41:47.620]  calls right now so Brian in PA these are incredible callers is talking about
[1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:51.620]  what's happening at the insurance level actuaries which is the real
[1:41:51.620 --> 1:41:56.540]  intelligence on what's happening in the economy not the polls not the whatever
[1:41:56.540 --> 1:42:01.380]  it's insurance actuaries are the most accurate Intel on the planet because they
[1:42:01.380 --> 1:42:06.420]  have to know actually what's going on not PR so recap what you were saying Brian
[1:42:06.420 --> 1:42:13.540]  and how they were getting you ready last last Christmas last winter for what's
[1:42:13.540 --> 1:42:20.060]  now happening yes Alex as as early as you know halfway through the year last
[1:42:20.060 --> 1:42:25.860]  year more towards the holidays season there were basically war game quote
[1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:31.900]  unquote efforts to establish kind of baseline figures as to what what would
[1:42:31.900 --> 1:42:39.020]  happen should large amounts of small to medium size provider groups becoming
[1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:45.220]  insolvent and it was marketed as a streamlining strategy right because all
[1:42:45.220 --> 1:42:49.420]  these large corporations their mantra is efficiency and streamlining and so on
[1:42:49.420 --> 1:42:54.620]  and so forth so they were already working and there weren't trends for small
[1:42:54.620 --> 1:42:57.860]  providers going on a business before that were there so so this is like
[1:42:57.860 --> 1:43:03.260]  clearly knowing this big crisis is coming right so with a lot of these
[1:43:03.260 --> 1:43:07.180]  provider groups you know heavily relying on Medicare Medicaid services things
[1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:11.500]  like that there's always a turn right where the old and the sick unfortunately
[1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:18.540]  will pass away but new members basically will be aged in so it's like it's not
[1:43:18.540 --> 1:43:23.060]  like it just comes to a halt so seeing things like that are very strange and I
[1:43:23.060 --> 1:43:26.140]  just kind of wanted to dovetail that into something I just found which is a
[1:43:26.140 --> 1:43:31.020]  documentary called caring corrupted which actually was an award-winning
[1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:34.740]  documentary it's on YouTube with like three and a half million views I know
[1:43:34.740 --> 1:43:38.660]  you know you guys kind of touch on a lot of these things but watching how I mean
[1:43:38.660 --> 1:43:42.660]  I'm shook up after watching seeing how this yeah no they're not wearing in to
[1:43:42.660 --> 1:43:50.220]  kill the old people tell us about it yeah so the Nazis could basically leverage
[1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:55.060]  the healthcare workers back during World War two to institute you know the
[1:43:55.060 --> 1:44:00.220]  the agenda the end goals of the state well let's be clear the training wheels
[1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:07.300]  for the Nazis in 33 34 35 6 7 was the medical court and then that was the group
[1:44:07.300 --> 1:44:11.140]  that carried out the final solution because the German office would follow
[1:44:11.140 --> 1:44:18.460]  orders if a doctor like Joseph Mingola told them oh this is medical exactly and
[1:44:18.460 --> 1:44:23.700]  I'm I mean I'm shook up after having watched I knew you know tidbits about
[1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:27.580]  kind of what went on and what the structure looked like but to see how an
[1:44:27.580 --> 1:44:31.820]  overwhelming majority of these healthcare people just kind of cheerleaded it
[1:44:31.820 --> 1:44:36.980]  because it was you know they're being on the winning team and so on and I'm
[1:44:36.980 --> 1:44:41.940]  frightened for you know when the next shoe drops what that might well that's
[1:44:41.940 --> 1:44:45.940]  trying to politically fix it but if things get so dark and so bad we'll do
[1:44:45.940 --> 1:44:51.420]  what we have to do brother and you know the but you know what you're getting at
[1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:56.060]  and then the medical tyranny is is in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was a
[1:44:56.060 --> 1:44:59.860]  medical tyranny it doesn't mean medical people are bad they're hardworking but
[1:44:59.860 --> 1:45:05.860]  we trust the medical community and so that's why evil tends to try to hide
[1:45:05.860 --> 1:45:11.660]  under that rubric thank you so much Brian all right that was a powerful call
[1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:20.540]  but you know I don't take pleasure being here on air talking about these
[1:45:20.540 --> 1:45:25.780]  negative things but I do take pleasure in sabotaging their operations so I'm
[1:45:25.780 --> 1:45:33.060]  gonna go to family members a sheriff and tell about mandatory testing Jeremy
[1:45:33.060 --> 1:45:37.100]  Woody active US military medical quarantine info from Japan I'm gonna go
[1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:41.500]  to Woody here next and and everybody else it's holding but I'll throw this in
[1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:47.220]  or he won't be here on air because it takes money to fund this operation we
[1:45:47.220 --> 1:45:52.980]  are running a special right now that has to end Monday or so because I haven't
[1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:58.380]  come to the new special yet and we have this big giant special going right now
[1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:06.860]  that is 30 to 70% off all the products at info or store.com and that means DNA
[1:46:06.860 --> 1:46:10.420]  Force plus that means bodies ultimate tumor formula that means living
[1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:15.660]  defense that means ultimate krill oil that means ultra 12 that's the very best
[1:46:15.660 --> 1:46:21.500]  B12 you're gonna find over the tongue x3 x2 supermail vitality vaso beats it's

[1:46:27.380 --> 1:46:35.340]  is sold at cost and it's an amazing ampm 13 different vitamins and minerals
[1:46:35.340 --> 1:46:40.780]  and different supplements a bunch of a proprietary that's how we find our
[1:46:40.780 --> 1:46:47.780]  operation so info or store.com or triple a 253 3139 but whatever you do
[1:46:47.780 --> 1:46:53.180]  realize that getting a t-shirt or a book or a film and committing to fund us
[1:46:53.180 --> 1:47:01.580]  keeps us in the game because it's epic how I'm saying this battle is it's
[1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:06.180]  absolutely epic to know that they've got all these powerful forces trying to
[1:47:06.180 --> 1:47:10.500]  shut us down but thanks to you you're keeping us in position and I don't see
[1:47:10.500 --> 1:47:16.300]  it as I'm in position for myself to be some guy that's successful and I'm in
[1:47:16.300 --> 1:47:21.340]  power and you know no no no I literally want to stay on target while you fund us
[1:47:21.340 --> 1:47:27.540]  I'm like a gun a big howitzer going boom boom boom I'm blasting the enemy we're
[1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:32.620]  having like spectacular victories like every view victory so huge I'm like oh
[1:47:32.620 --> 1:47:37.820]  just please energize me and a lazy part of me is like oh they'll smash me soon
[1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:41.500]  I'll be out of this soon but then I'm like no no you're gonna stay in the fight
[1:47:41.500 --> 1:47:47.300]  so again there is nowhere in the universe that you can fund an operation
[1:47:47.300 --> 1:47:52.300]  it's more hardcore having victory against the globalist as info or store.com
[1:47:52.300 --> 1:47:56.740]  so this special has got to end early next week because we'll run out a lot of
[1:47:56.740 --> 1:47:59.540]  the products I want to thank you all for your support all right let's get another
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:04.140]  caller here let's go to Woody Woody kind of like it with the TV screens keep
[1:48:04.140 --> 1:48:08.940]  going out with a glitch kind of like this back leave the rest of show the rest
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:13.420]  of show I don't want any backgrounds I love this this black look it's very cut
[1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:17.860]  away look Woody in Japan active military what's your view on this thanks for
[1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:23.900]  calling hey how you doing Alex man I'm I'm good I'm here in the dress rehearsal
[1:48:23.900 --> 1:48:32.140]  for Valhalla well I'm calling over Wi-Fi so I can hear what you're saying tell
[1:48:32.140 --> 1:48:36.980]  us what you think's really going on brother so I want to give you an only
[1:48:36.980 --> 1:48:42.500]  something interesting so USFGA US Armed Forces of Japan pushed out of order you
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:46.820]  know pretty much for the whole thing right of that we're going through and
[1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:52.700]  talking about if you have members that come in and go into quarantine they're
[1:48:52.700 --> 1:48:57.260]  coming back in the states they're in restricted movement two weeks quarantine
[1:48:57.260 --> 1:49:01.660]  things like that if you break that you can be charged under UCMJ being a
[1:49:01.660 --> 1:49:07.180]  senior Marine that I am kind of savvy in the legal realm I'm like all right I
[1:49:07.180 --> 1:49:11.140]  didn't really think too much of it and so I look at the article which is article
[1:49:11.140 --> 1:49:16.860]  84 specifically you know that's strange because that I had to go back to my old
[1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:22.300]  hard copy in the 2016 edition and it was a different article so to give you
[1:49:22.300 --> 1:49:32.020]  context the current UCMJ in 2019 edition it was the the revisions were
[1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:38.900]  signed by an executive order 13 825 by Trump in March of 2018 that went into the
[1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:46.220]  federal registry in December of 2018 to be the new 2019 UCMJ that article was
[1:49:46.220 --> 1:49:53.540]  changed from affecting unlawful enlistment and appointment or separation
[1:49:53.540 --> 1:49:57.620]  which had always been to breach of medical quarantine so that was
[1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:02.980]  affected almost more than two years ago I'd find that I mean exactly just like
[1:50:02.980 --> 1:50:07.220]  the last caller said the insurance companies it was preset up and they
[1:50:07.220 --> 1:50:14.500]  even have bizarre EU funded comic book predicted pandemic with the EU as the
[1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:19.540]  savior with the chai comps so again exactly everybody can see this it's all
[1:50:19.540 --> 1:50:24.580]  pre-programs what you're saying yeah pretty much and I know y'all got your
[1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:28.060]  resources I know like Robert Barnes you can probably look into this I just and
[1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:32.940]  the few guys you know in my community that I talked to about it you know only a
[1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:36.820]  few kind of like gave me that that eyebrow raising like are you thrilled I'm
[1:50:36.820 --> 1:50:42.260]  like yeah man we need to you know gotta keep our ears around on this so yeah I
[1:50:42.260 --> 1:50:46.900]  just appreciate just want to let you know you know for us out here you know

[1:50:56.780 --> 1:51:00.340]  comments about the Marine Corps but we're not all lost we're not all couples

[1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:15.180]  Marine Corps no I mean I'm sorry we thought I said that well here's the
[1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:19.140]  difference brother we're all on this together and I love you and now all the
[1:51:19.140 --> 1:51:22.700]  games are over toe-to-toe with the New World Order folks they're coming with

[1:51:34.820 --> 1:51:41.700]  Loomer and so much more straight ahead stay well we are 170 days out from the
[1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:46.420]  2020 election it is a referendum of national sovereignty against
[1:51:46.420 --> 1:51:50.820]  localism and Obama Hillary and the deep state have been caught attempting to
[1:51:50.820 --> 1:51:55.540]  overthrow President Trump's election and they've been caught in two separate
[1:51:55.540 --> 1:52:00.060]  coup attempts against the president now they've been pushing COVID-19 shut down
[1:52:00.060 --> 1:52:03.620]  the economy and created depression well China's already been open for business
[1:52:03.620 --> 1:52:08.500]  for more than a month this is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the
[1:52:08.500 --> 1:52:12.500]  American people wreck our economy and hope that we won't recognize that it is
[1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:16.340]  they the New World Order that have orchestrated this and not President
[1:52:16.340 --> 1:52:20.300]  Trump they know their crimes are coming out they know the chickens are coming
[1:52:20.300 --> 1:52:25.020]  home to roast so now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election
[1:52:25.020 --> 1:52:30.340]  with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19 the entire
[1:52:30.340 --> 1:52:36.580]  COVID-19 system is a giant hopes and must be exposed if America has any hope so
[1:52:36.580 --> 1:52:40.260]  get out there and expose this fraud
[1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:46.700]  this is the end my friends my only friends the end of our elaborate plans
[1:52:46.700 --> 1:52:54.300]  the end of everything that stands the end the safety the delusion it's all
[1:52:54.300 --> 1:53:00.460]  over ladies and gentlemen because it was only the mirage of safety movies and
[1:53:00.460 --> 1:53:04.460]  partying and living like children never growing up ever caring about other
[1:53:04.460 --> 1:53:10.260]  people this delivered us into the hands of tyranny just like the history book
[1:53:10.260 --> 1:53:14.140]  show it's just like the Bible states every time Israel became corrupt and
[1:53:14.140 --> 1:53:18.860]  evil and turned away from God they were brought into captivity because their
[1:53:18.860 --> 1:53:24.020]  people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated by spies and then they
[1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:29.380]  were enslaved we are repeating that again today compliance and going along
[1:53:29.380 --> 1:53:34.940]  with this system leads to absolute bondage info wars has decided to fight
[1:53:34.940 --> 1:53:38.940]  for freedom info wars is that great victory thanks to your support and your
[1:53:38.940 --> 1:53:41.300]  prayers

[1:54:12.180 --> 1:54:20.500]  motorcycle crash dubbed COVID death that's like shark attack dubbed COVID
[1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:24.700]  death so Jack thanks for calling tell us tell us what you witnessed and thanks
[1:54:24.700 --> 1:54:29.820]  for holding hey Alex can you hear me okay I can thanks for calling and great
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:33.260]  yeah I'm down here in Albany Georgia you might know that this is one of the
[1:54:33.260 --> 1:54:39.540]  worst affected areas in the whole nation per capita for COVID cases and I've got
[1:54:39.540 --> 1:54:43.540]  two different parts of this I get some intel that I like to share with you the
[1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:47.980]  first is the medical impact that we've had that I've seen and the second is
[1:54:47.980 --> 1:54:51.660]  economics impact that we've seen so I'll go ahead and share that with you so
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:56.820]  first I would tell you that one thing that they're not talking about is that
[1:54:56.820 --> 1:55:01.140]  our cardiac calls increase as the main call that we've been having is that we
[1:55:01.140 --> 1:55:06.300]  on average before COVID we had five per week and during COVID we had about 30
[1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:10.220]  per week so I think that they don't even know how this is killing people I think
[1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:14.220]  that they have that you know the elite you know whoever the policymakers are
[1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:18.020]  not really telling us how this happens or they don't understand so that's the
[1:55:18.020 --> 1:55:21.700]  first thing it's gone back down to about our average now so I think that we're
[1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:25.300]  getting over the hump and that's the first part of the medical thing I'd like
[1:55:25.300 --> 1:55:28.860]  to share the second part of the medical thing and I'll get back to economic
[1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:36.180]  part I responded to a motorcycle crash last week and it was a fatality on the
[1:55:36.180 --> 1:55:41.020]  scene and they took him into the hospital and then the Italian chief called me
[1:55:41.020 --> 1:55:44.180]  the day after and said you know that motorcycle crash you respond to and I
[1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:48.540]  said yeah he said that was a COVID death because he tested positive for COVID when
[1:55:48.540 --> 1:55:52.260]  he was riding his motorcycle even though he didn't die from COVID it was
[1:55:52.260 --> 1:55:57.580]  solicited a COVID death because he tested positive for COVID but in the
[1:55:57.580 --> 1:56:01.260]  the economic part that I'd like to share hold on let's go back we'll hold you
[1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:05.300]  over if need be Laura Loomer's popping in but we'll go back to calls but start
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:08.220]  back over here because they've made the joke shark attacks are being counted
[1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:13.140]  as COVID-19 there a guy dies in a motorcycle accident and they're calling
[1:56:13.140 --> 1:56:20.020]  it COVID-19 go go back to what you were told right yeah so yeah so he died I
[1:56:20.020 --> 1:56:24.700]  mean he would you know he obviously died and and we do have a lot of COVID death
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:29.020]  now don't get me wrong there are a lot of we've had cardiac calls like I said we
[1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:32.780]  have had respiratory calls we have had that kind of thing but yes it was a
[1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:35.660]  motorcycle death and battalion chief told me that and I think part of the
[1:56:35.660 --> 1:56:40.220]  reason sure so yeah if there's so many deaths they get this here COVID why say
[1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:45.980]  somebody turned into a you know an omelet in a motorcycle wreck why call
[1:56:45.980 --> 1:56:49.500]  that COVID how does that happen well I think part of it had to do with the
[1:56:49.500 --> 1:56:52.900]  hospital getting funding for how many COVID deaths there are and so if they
[1:56:52.900 --> 1:56:56.020]  can say there's more at the hospital down here which is corrupt which I won't
[1:56:56.020 --> 1:57:00.060]  say the name of it but you can look them up Albany Georgia we took them all the
[1:57:00.060 --> 1:57:02.900]  way to the Supreme Court our current mayor actually sued them all the way up
[1:57:02.900 --> 1:57:08.060]  to the Supreme Court for but for having a monopoly so I mean it's a hospital
[1:57:08.060 --> 1:57:16.180]  system for one but yeah that's a big is a COVID death let me ask you this other
[1:57:16.180 --> 1:57:21.180]  EMTs police officers what is the consensus or is there a consensus while
[1:57:21.180 --> 1:57:25.340]  this is going on well I can say that we're definitely taking you know
[1:57:25.340 --> 1:57:29.780]  precautions like we would I mean if it's a COVID call we'll wear Kyvek and we
[1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:34.580]  will wear all the protective gear and it's you know the virus the virus is
[1:57:34.580 --> 1:57:39.660]  definitely real but I think that there is an overstatement for you know some of
[1:57:39.660 --> 1:57:43.580]  the things that the economic policy so like for example I'll say that I'm
[1:57:43.580 --> 1:57:47.220]  mostly afraid of the debasement of the dollar because the Fed has increased the
[1:57:47.220 --> 1:57:51.660]  monetary supply by one and a half times oh exactly the economic collapse if
[1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:54.940]  people want something to be afraid of well they better piss their pants over
[1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:59.220]  collapse yeah yeah I've been buying precious metals I actually saw that
[1:57:59.220 --> 1:58:04.060]  your friend John McAfee has a new private cryptocurrency called ghost that
[1:58:04.060 --> 1:58:07.500]  is you know it's separate from Chinese influence separate from the Fed I'm
[1:58:07.500 --> 1:58:11.420]  looking into that but yeah I'm trying to keep my money private from the banking
[1:58:11.420 --> 1:58:14.980]  elite because right now I think it's all about ownership of wealth and that's
[1:58:14.980 --> 1:58:18.380]  why I'm buying fresh metals and keep it a little bit of a little check I think
[1:58:18.380 --> 1:58:21.060]  you're doing the right thing everybody just better realize we're not in
[1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:25.780]  Kansas anymore God bless you and I appreciate your call yeah you know six
[1:58:25.780 --> 1:58:30.340]  years ago I lost my uncle my great uncle and my cousin from some deadly
[1:58:30.340 --> 1:58:35.660]  pneumonia at our ranch three houses three people dead so I know this stuff's
[1:58:35.660 --> 1:58:40.940]  real but the hysteria is synthetic Laura Loomer pops in and more of your

[2:00:03.740 --> 2:00:08.580]  it's Chancellor Sutler dammit why because while the truncheon may be used

[2:00:14.300 --> 2:00:18.980]  means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of the truth
[2:00:18.980 --> 2:00:24.300]  the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't that
[2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:27.460]  you designed it sir you wanted it for proof you told me every television in
[2:00:27.460 --> 2:00:32.600]  longer cruelty and injustice intolerance and depression and where once you had the
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:37.300]  freedom to object to think and speak as you saw fit you now have senses and
[2:00:37.300 --> 2:00:41.220]  systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and so getting your
[2:00:41.220 --> 2:00:46.700]  submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are
[2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:51.020]  those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable but
[2:00:51.020 --> 2:00:55.900]  again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a
[2:00:55.900 --> 2:01:03.340]  mirror I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror
[2:01:03.340 --> 2:01:09.220]  disease there were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason and
[2:01:09.220 --> 2:01:14.140]  rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you
[2:01:14.140 --> 2:01:19.380]  turned to the now high Chancellor Adam Sutler he promised you order he promised
[2:01:19.380 --> 2:01:26.060]  you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[2:01:29.900 --> 2:01:36.700]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the
[2:01:36.700 --> 2:01:55.420]  time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info war thank
[2:01:55.420 --> 2:02:17.220]  God it's the end this is the end we know the winds my only friend the end no
[2:02:17.220 --> 2:02:30.460]  safety I'll never look into your eyes again it's good to have a race it's
[2:02:30.460 --> 2:02:47.580]  been well-run can you picture what will be so limitless and free all right
[2:02:47.580 --> 2:02:51.220]  for this for a few segments that were continued with your calls in the fourth
[2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:56.980]  hour Jeremy and Catherine and Kathleen and Heather and Austin and Vanessa and
[2:02:56.980 --> 2:03:03.300]  Scotty and Jamal don't hang up I'm going to you but risen like a phoenix from the
[2:03:03.300 --> 2:03:11.540]  ashes Laura Loomer one of the most banned people on the internet is running
[2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:16.620]  for Congress in Florida and is ahead in polls which really pisses the enemy off
[2:03:16.620 --> 2:03:21.300]  and she's here with us today Laura Loomer for Congress calm where folks can
[2:03:21.300 --> 2:03:25.340]  support her and find out what she's doing Laura great to have you on with us
[2:03:25.340 --> 2:03:30.980]  and great to see you stronger than ever under attack thanks so much for having
[2:03:30.980 --> 2:03:35.300]  me Alex it's good to see you so where do you want to start I got a thousand
[2:03:35.300 --> 2:03:39.540]  questions but I'm sure you've got a thousand answers well it's pretty
[2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:44.380]  incredible isn't it because what happens is when they do platform you and you
[2:03:44.380 --> 2:03:47.340]  know this because you're the most banned man in the world and I'm the most banned
[2:03:47.340 --> 2:03:50.860]  woman in the world they do it because they try to kill you off they want to
[2:03:50.860 --> 2:03:54.700]  silence you but now I'm running for Congress and I'm outperforming the
[2:03:54.700 --> 2:03:58.940]  Democrat incumbent and I'm out fundraising her and as you're not just
[2:03:58.940 --> 2:04:02.820]  saying that this is even with her fake polls you're in the lead they're like
[2:04:02.820 --> 2:04:08.020]  crapping themselves right now oh no they they definitely are and a couple weeks
[2:04:08.020 --> 2:04:13.460]  ago president Trump actually retweeted a profile about me that was published in
[2:04:13.460 --> 2:04:17.940]  the New York Post about my campaign and I think now it's becoming very real to
[2:04:17.940 --> 2:04:22.300]  people that they're not going to be able to cancel me again and so I've been
[2:04:22.300 --> 2:04:26.260]  having a very successful congressional campaign here in Florida's 21st
[2:04:26.260 --> 2:04:30.380]  congressional district my opponent is obstructionist Democrat Lois
[2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:35.820]  Frankl who's a four-term Democrat Congresswoman and as many people know I
[2:04:35.820 --> 2:04:41.380]  was inspired to run for Congress and filed to run in August of 2019 as a
[2:04:41.380 --> 2:04:44.420]  result of tech censorship because what we're seeing is an absolute
[2:04:44.420 --> 2:04:48.180]  silencing of all conservative viewpoints in our country and a rise of
[2:04:48.180 --> 2:04:53.700]  communists far left politicians in the halls of Congress and what we're
[2:04:53.700 --> 2:04:58.780]  witnessing right now with this pandemic is just people turning a blind eye to
[2:04:58.780 --> 2:05:03.220]  the fact that we are in this global crisis right now or that's my that was
[2:05:03.220 --> 2:05:06.780]  my first question for you so I figured you would just bring it up without me
[2:05:06.780 --> 2:05:10.340]  even telling you what I wanted to go is we're all simpatico here I like Trump
[2:05:10.340 --> 2:05:16.740]  okay but the the putting up with the censorship and the total control now
[2:05:16.740 --> 2:05:21.700]  even himself being censored I'm starting to get really sick of Trump I'm gonna be
[2:05:21.700 --> 2:05:26.220]  honest I love him way better than the Democrats but I mean like why doesn't he
[2:05:26.220 --> 2:05:31.340]  do something I'm getting really upset here well look it's a legitimate
[2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:35.500]  frustration and interestingly enough this district is actually home to
[2:05:35.500 --> 2:05:39.860]  President Trump and Mrs. Trump and so when I went out you're like right there
[2:05:39.860 --> 2:05:44.620]  in Marlago yeah so when I win I'll be President Donald Trump's a Congresswoman
[2:05:44.620 --> 2:05:49.820]  because he's a resident of District 21 but supporting you that's great how
[2:05:49.820 --> 2:05:54.060]  about he stops the censorship yeah that's the thing is we need people in
[2:05:54.060 --> 2:05:57.980]  Congress who are actually going to do something about this and with the rise
[2:05:57.980 --> 2:06:03.540]  of Facebook's new project American Edge you see it that it's not just Democrats
[2:06:03.540 --> 2:06:08.460]  in Congress like Muslim Brotherhood leaders run what Americans can like
[2:06:08.460 --> 2:06:12.540]  even Americans they've got like Muslim Brotherhood runs the censorship why
[2:06:12.540 --> 2:06:17.020]  don't put the PLO in charge right and Pamela Carlin who of course who
[2:06:17.020 --> 2:06:23.220]  describes herself as a was a torch bearer for for the Democrats and she was
[2:06:23.220 --> 2:06:27.380]  one of the individuals who testified in Congress and then openly attacked
[2:06:27.380 --> 2:06:31.380]  Barron Trump so these are radical exactly the same lady that attacked
[2:06:31.380 --> 2:06:37.320]  Barron Trump is running Facebook censorship yeah these are these are open
[2:06:37.320 --> 2:06:42.180]  progressives people who have very strong partisan biases against President
[2:06:42.180 --> 2:06:45.860]  Trump and his supporters and unfortunately you know nothing's being done
[2:06:45.860 --> 2:06:50.380]  about it and so I took it upon myself to run for Congress and when I win I'm
[2:06:50.380 --> 2:06:55.300]  hoping to take the bull by the horns and address this issue of big tech tyranny
[2:06:55.300 --> 2:07:00.140]  head-on about that because I don't just believe the headlines I wouldn't look
[2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:03.940]  to me you're leading in every poll what are they gonna do they're there they
[2:07:03.940 --> 2:07:09.740]  are having a big problem here oh well you know they they can't stop me Alex and
[2:07:09.740 --> 2:07:13.380]  that you can't stop you can't stop with the American people want and
[2:07:13.380 --> 2:07:16.860]  unfortunately these people have become accustomed to thinking that Twitter is
[2:07:16.860 --> 2:07:21.300]  real life they think that nothing matters unless the blue check overlords
[2:07:21.300 --> 2:07:27.500]  say that fantasy bubble that dome city of weirdness yeah they don't realize that
[2:07:27.500 --> 2:07:32.900]  there's people outside of Twitter who who have an issue with this as well have
[2:07:32.900 --> 2:07:36.740]  an issue with this tech tyranny and my message is resonating with millions of
[2:07:36.740 --> 2:07:41.000]  people you know I'm running for Congress in Florida but it's receiving
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:44.820]  national actually international headlines even the Daily Mail reported on
[2:07:44.820 --> 2:07:48.860]  my congressional camp you're great you're well-spoken but it is a cost
[2:07:48.860 --> 2:07:51.940]  to live thank God you're getting international support that's how you're
[2:07:51.940 --> 2:07:56.540]  gonna beat them because I mean I see what you're doing as really a benchmark
[2:07:56.540 --> 2:08:04.500]  as a litmus test right and and you see that even as a declared congressional
[2:08:04.500 --> 2:08:09.060]  candidate they won't allow my campaign to have access to any social media so my
[2:08:09.060 --> 2:08:14.140]  campaign is banning election meddling I mean just again what is Trump doing
[2:08:14.140 --> 2:08:19.580]  what yeah look I mean we need we need more leadership on this on this matter
[2:08:19.580 --> 2:08:24.820]  for sure and I'm calling on you know the Republican Party yeah Trump should be
[2:08:24.820 --> 2:08:28.300]  championing you every day he shouldn't just send a couple tweets out and I'm
[2:08:28.300 --> 2:08:32.540]  not on Trump's ass but I mean I see his stuff suppressed everywhere like why do
[2:08:32.540 --> 2:08:37.060]  we put up with this yeah and just the other day Jack Dorsey and Twitter
[2:08:37.060 --> 2:08:39.580]  announced new terms of service with Twitter that said that they're gonna
[2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:43.820]  start deleting some of the president's tweets and labeling them as misinformation
[2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:47.340]  so they're openly now saying that in a presidential election year they're
[2:08:47.340 --> 2:08:50.820]  gonna censor the president and so that's the headline Twitter announces they are
[2:08:50.820 --> 2:08:56.100]  censoring Trump's tweets because incrementally he put up with it and so
[2:08:56.100 --> 2:09:01.940]  who's a bigger enemy Jack Dorsey or Donald Trump well look big tech is
[2:09:01.940 --> 2:09:06.420]  definitely the biggest enemy yeah no I get that Laura but here's the deal if
[2:09:06.420 --> 2:09:10.140]  somebody walks up and punches one of my kids in the face and I don't kick their
[2:09:10.140 --> 2:09:14.540]  ass I'm the real problem and I mean and I'm out here like everybody knows I'm
[2:09:14.540 --> 2:09:18.700]  very loyal to Trump but it's it's wearing very thin right now
[2:09:18.700 --> 2:09:23.860]  the president's as well but I definitely believe that he needs to be doing more to
[2:09:23.860 --> 2:09:26.780]  address this issue of tech tyranny because it is hands down the most
[2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:33.340]  important election issue this election exactly here's the deal it's great that
[2:09:33.340 --> 2:09:38.060]  Trump's incredibly confident that's what help but but it doesn't matter if
[2:09:38.060 --> 2:09:42.020]  they're censoring him so he has this weird confidence that he can beat them by
[2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:47.500]  confidence no that's not how this works the lockdown is permanent
[2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:53.340]  dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic
[2:09:53.340 --> 2:10:00.060]  rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the
[2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:05.580]  Bill and the Gates Foundation in full control many will submit through fear
[2:10:05.580 --> 2:10:10.660]  others will be bought off but in the end the globalist admit they're building a
[2:10:10.660 --> 2:10:16.140]  post-human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very
[2:10:16.140 --> 2:10:23.380]  very quickly into its in game submission to this is a form of living death and
[2:10:23.380 --> 2:10:28.820]  committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that
[2:10:28.820 --> 2:10:34.100]  cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity
[2:10:34.100 --> 2:10:39.460]  your soul your future being poured inside out this is a scientific
[2:10:39.460 --> 2:10:46.980]  dictatorship to infold control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip what info wars
[2:10:46.980 --> 2:10:50.940]  has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[2:10:50.940 --> 2:10:57.580]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic this is the
[2:10:57.580 --> 2:11:02.060]  battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being
[2:11:02.060 --> 2:11:08.500]  established with an end game to depopulate the planet now the internal
[2:11:08.500 --> 2:11:14.060]  operations of the globalist are being externalized you must decide which side
[2:11:14.060 --> 2:11:18.740]  you're on living in denial having mass Stockholm syndrome learned help will
[2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:24.340]  since we'll only deliver you into misery destruction and finally death and this
[2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:28.780]  is a spiritual death we're talking about not just a physical death the
[2:11:28.780 --> 2:11:34.500]  delusions must end now info wars was correct about it all we have come so
[2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:38.340]  far by exposing the enemy most people that are aware of the new order decide
[2:11:38.340 --> 2:11:43.740]  to join it out of fear they are truly fools we must fight this or lose our
[2:11:43.740 --> 2:11:46.140]  souls
[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:53.460]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:11:53.460 --> 2:12:13.820]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[2:12:13.820 --> 2:12:20.540]  listening to Alex Jones
[2:12:20.540 --> 2:12:23.740]  with us Vanessa and all of the red collars were getting you coming up next
[2:12:23.740 --> 2:12:27.900]  segment so Laura lima running for Congress in Trump's district there at
[2:12:27.900 --> 2:12:32.940]  Mar-a-Lago look at all the crazy things happening in the world what do you make
[2:12:32.940 --> 2:12:35.940]  a trump coming out saying we'll have the military give me the
[2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:40.980]  inoculation next year that scares the hell out of me yeah well it makes me
[2:12:40.980 --> 2:12:46.140]  nervous as well and you know I'm not I'm not too happy to see that there's
[2:12:46.140 --> 2:12:51.460]  discussion about you know militarizing vaccinations and I think that a lot of
[2:12:51.460 --> 2:12:54.940]  it this this plays hand-in-hand with the tech censorship right because a lot of
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:12:58.940]  Americans a lot of Trump supporters and his base feel the same way but they're
[2:12:58.940 --> 2:13:02.460]  being banned online for simply expressing this I mean just the other day I
[2:13:02.460 --> 2:13:07.060]  received a tip from you know somebody who was concerned and they contacted me
[2:13:07.060 --> 2:13:10.540]  and they said that's a page for concerned mothers on Facebook who are
[2:13:10.540 --> 2:13:14.340]  concerned about vaccinations was totally banned for misinformation on
[2:13:14.340 --> 2:13:19.900]  Facebook and it's a rain of terror and oppression and Trump has failed to stand
[2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:25.900]  up for the first minute why do you think he does that well it's not just the
[2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:29.380]  president's I think that it's people on both sides of the aisle and they
[2:13:29.380 --> 2:13:33.700]  realize how influential these tech companies really are now because
[2:13:33.700 --> 2:13:38.180]  everybody's using them for the sake of spreading their message and fundraising
[2:13:38.180 --> 2:13:40.900]  in an election well yeah it's like a telephone company that if you don't
[2:13:40.900 --> 2:13:44.620]  kiss its ass it doesn't let you use the phone but oh it's private companies we
[2:13:44.620 --> 2:13:47.940]  can monitor me in a lot of time and control what I say we've just given
[2:13:47.940 --> 2:13:53.220]  them this authoritarian rule and so a lot of a lot of elected officials are
[2:13:53.220 --> 2:13:58.700]  nervous to call out big tech for the censorship and the tyranny that is
[2:13:58.700 --> 2:14:02.260]  taking place because if big tech gets pissed off well what's to say they're
[2:14:02.260 --> 2:14:05.180]  not gonna ban you from doing ads what's to say that they're not going to shut
[2:14:05.180 --> 2:14:08.300]  down your page in the middle of an election year and they do do this they're
[2:14:08.300 --> 2:14:11.980]  very vindictive you know I when I filed to run for Congress it was the number
[2:14:11.980 --> 2:14:15.900]  one trend on Twitter and so what did Twitter do well they decided to change
[2:14:15.900 --> 2:14:21.580]  their rules the very next day and they made it so that you had to win your
[2:14:21.580 --> 2:14:26.180]  primary to get a verified check mark or even an account as a candidate running
[2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:31.820]  for Congress I'm going is that everyone groveling to them encourages them to be
[2:14:31.820 --> 2:14:37.140]  more suppressive and call their bluff yeah and I wrote I wrote a really good
[2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:40.780]  article about this the other day encouraging people to quit their big
[2:14:40.780 --> 2:14:44.500]  tech addiction before it quits you and that's what's happening is every time
[2:14:44.500 --> 2:14:47.460]  somebody gets banned you see conservatives come and they say oh my
[2:14:47.460 --> 2:14:51.060]  god it's so outrageous it's so crazy you know the censorship is getting so bad
[2:14:51.060 --> 2:14:54.460]  but then they just beg to get put back on and they're not utilizing sites like
[2:14:54.460 --> 2:14:59.100]  parlor where I am or gap you know another free speech exactly incrementally
[2:14:59.100 --> 2:15:03.180]  they get us to bow down and then pretty soon we'll do anything it's like we're
[2:15:03.180 --> 2:15:09.300]  just slaves well people are they are becoming slaves to big tech and we see
[2:15:09.300 --> 2:15:13.780]  that they're taking advantage of this crisis when over you know three billion
[2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:17.140]  people around the world are in quarantine and what do you do when you're
[2:15:17.140 --> 2:15:20.740]  being mandated to social distance with threats of arrest if you leave your
[2:15:20.740 --> 2:15:25.580]  home and you go outside you can't consume information they banned you off
[2:15:25.580 --> 2:15:29.580]  Twitter but I guess they get election meddling is bad so so far they've
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:33.660]  shadow banned you but not banned your congressional site they kind of still
[2:15:33.660 --> 2:15:37.660]  get like oh we're not supposed to ban a candidate no I don't I don't have a
[2:15:37.660 --> 2:15:42.300]  Twitter account for my campaign I don't have any campaign so it's a fan site
[2:15:42.300 --> 2:15:46.100]  which account are you talking about we're just showing Laurel that's gab oh
[2:15:46.100 --> 2:15:50.980]  that's gab so you're not even allowed a site running for Congress no so they
[2:15:50.980 --> 2:15:55.460]  changed their rules and then and then what happened is when I tried to create
[2:15:55.460 --> 2:15:58.980]  a Facebook account for my campaign Facebook banned it in less than 24
[2:15:58.980 --> 2:16:02.500]  hours and then when Breitbart reached out to them they said well we're creating
[2:16:02.500 --> 2:16:05.820]  a new policy that says if you've been previously banned and you know you and
[2:16:05.820 --> 2:16:09.620]  I were both banned and labeled sure so this is just a giant complete power grab
[2:16:09.620 --> 2:16:13.500]  they're totally leveraging their power over society these are the enemies of
[2:16:13.500 --> 2:16:17.820]  America and yes they are enemies and this is why Republicans need to act now
[2:16:17.820 --> 2:16:21.660]  because this is election interference and just like I warned when I was sitting
[2:16:21.660 --> 2:16:25.260]  next to you inside that congressional hearing two years ago and Jack Dorsey was
[2:16:25.260 --> 2:16:28.620]  committing perjury in line to Congress and I stood up and I made a personal
[2:16:28.620 --> 2:16:31.900]  plea to President Trump and I said Mr. President please help us before it is too
[2:16:31.900 --> 2:16:36.540]  late because Jack Dorsey is you know trying to influence influence the
[2:16:36.540 --> 2:16:41.540]  election by sabotaging and I agree with you so here's the deal I'm not a
[2:16:41.540 --> 2:16:46.260]  chump and I hate Hillary and I hate the Obama and I hate the globalist and I
[2:16:46.260 --> 2:16:50.300]  hate radical Islam but I'm sitting here looking at Trump with his
[2:16:50.300 --> 2:16:55.180]  inoculation plans and can put up with this and I'm just like I'm souring on
[2:16:55.180 --> 2:16:58.980]  Trump right now man and I get like oh what you for the day no I'm not for the
[2:16:58.980 --> 2:17:03.020]  Democrats either it's like at a certain point he gives us constituents
[2:17:03.020 --> 2:17:08.460]  nothing he pit like he wasn't in Piscay he wasn't in the Russian you know St.
[2:17:08.460 --> 2:17:13.180]  Petersburg Hotel with hookers pissing on him but he's pissing on me and I'm like
[2:17:13.180 --> 2:17:20.380]  dude stop peeing on me like I'm I'm I'm just saying Laura I'm starting to get
[2:17:20.380 --> 2:17:25.060]  mad at Trump yeah well this is this is an issue that Republicans really need to
[2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:29.180]  deal with because every single day people are being silenced and it's really
[2:17:29.180 --> 2:17:32.860]  starting to agitate many members of the base because they're being silenced in
[2:17:32.860 --> 2:17:36.940]  an election year and and people are going to start reacting by maybe
[2:17:36.940 --> 2:17:39.940]  withholding their votes if something isn't done about this and so you're
[2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:45.260]  absolutely legitimate in your in your feelings of irritation regarding this
[2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:49.300]  matter because you know many people are I mean what are you supposed to do every
[2:17:49.300 --> 2:17:53.220]  single day when you're being shut down and your rights are being violated it's
[2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:57.460]  no longer just a free speech issue it's a civil rights issue people you hitler
[2:17:57.460 --> 2:18:03.420]  and then you can't respond as your band right or or they label they say that
[2:18:03.420 --> 2:18:06.820]  you're a dangerous individual and then they issue a statement that says it's
[2:18:06.820 --> 2:18:09.820]  okay to post death threats against people who are dangerous individuals I
[2:18:09.820 --> 2:18:14.180]  mean I forgot that they said you and Paul Watson could be death-threaded well
[2:18:14.180 --> 2:18:17.420]  you as well you were labeled as a dangerous individual you know and so you
[2:18:17.420 --> 2:18:20.860]  have the United States congressman Paul Gosar who seems to be one of the only
[2:18:20.860 --> 2:18:24.700]  members of Congress who gives a damn about this issue writing a letter to
[2:18:24.700 --> 2:18:28.620]  Attorney General William Barr saying hey you have Facebook over here saying
[2:18:28.620 --> 2:18:32.180]  it's okay for people to post death threats and incite high-severity lethal
[2:18:32.180 --> 2:18:36.500]  violence against people they deem dangerous oh all those people Trump
[2:18:36.500 --> 2:18:40.420]  supporters what's being done about it I mean I feel I feel the frustration
[2:18:40.420 --> 2:18:45.260]  trust me because I am the front and Trump to win and stuff but I'm like man
[2:18:45.260 --> 2:18:48.940]  since when decide you not stand up for their people because everybody's been
[2:18:48.940 --> 2:18:52.500]  telling me I'm a schmuck I'm an idiot you gotta go after Trump I'm like yeah
[2:18:52.500 --> 2:18:56.380]  but the Democrats are worse but at a certain point I'm like well then let
[2:18:56.380 --> 2:19:02.220]  them burn me alive even Trump will stand up for me what do I do yeah well many
[2:19:02.220 --> 2:19:06.100]  many members of the base are feeling are feeling this way right now with
[2:19:06.100 --> 2:19:09.820]  regards to this issue of tech censorship and that's why I've been calling on the
[2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:14.200]  Republican Party for many years now to make this a key platform issue it is
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:18.380]  hands down the most important campaign issue right now because it doesn't matter
[2:19:18.380 --> 2:19:21.860]  what you may think about anything else what your positions may be on any other
[2:19:21.860 --> 2:19:26.580]  issue that that may influence your votes if your right to talk about it is
[2:19:26.580 --> 2:19:30.220]  shut down none of us are gonna be able to communicate and what's gonna stop
[2:19:30.220 --> 2:19:34.060]  these big tech companies who are now putting chai comms on their boards board
[2:19:34.060 --> 2:19:37.660]  of advisors like Twitter did this last week you know what's gonna stop them
[2:19:37.660 --> 2:19:41.540]  three weeks out from election day from just banning everybody okay you see
[2:19:41.540 --> 2:19:44.300]  that they're trying to push for mail-in ballots the Democrats are trying to keep
[2:19:44.300 --> 2:19:47.540]  lockdowns in some parts of the country going for another three months it's
[2:19:47.540 --> 2:19:50.780]  because they want to control the election they want people to be so
[2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:55.460]  scared to leave their home but they don't participate in that's it and and I
[2:19:55.460 --> 2:19:59.420]  get as Americans were measured and we don't do radical stuff but we've been
[2:19:59.420 --> 2:20:03.660]  brought to this radical point we got calls coming up but I want to do a few
[2:20:03.660 --> 2:20:06.700]  more minutes with Laura Loomer I'm gonna go to Jeremy and Catherine and Heather
[2:20:06.700 --> 2:20:10.220]  and Austin and Vanessa and Scotty and Jamal we're gonna come right back with
[2:20:10.220 --> 2:20:14.500]  Laura Loomer and hear what she's calling for her rally the troops to get her
[2:20:14.500 --> 2:20:19.240]  elected to Congress and saying out of this this is just so insane that we
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:23.980]  reached this point it makes my head absolutely spin but will continue to be
[2:20:23.980 --> 2:20:27.940]  faithful to common sense on the other side stay well as we'll be right back
[2:20:27.940 --> 2:20:31.220]  in full wars.com
[2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:48.860]  feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America
[2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:53.940]  was the most common form of government you had a ruling class the nobility the
[2:20:53.940 --> 2:20:57.580]  king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a
[2:20:57.580 --> 2:21:04.020]  subsistence starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the
[2:21:04.020 --> 2:21:08.700]  peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than
[2:21:08.700 --> 2:21:14.100]  the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they were
[2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:17.660]  so busy trying to survive they would never try to challenge the
[2:21:17.660 --> 2:21:21.500]  entrenched elite well now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and
[2:21:21.500 --> 2:21:25.260]  the Rothschilds the Jeff Bezos is the world they're sitting back on their
[2:21:25.260 --> 2:21:30.060]  giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets living the
[2:21:30.060 --> 2:21:35.220]  life laughing at you shut down going bankrupt in the third world starving to
[2:21:35.220 --> 2:21:40.380]  death their religion is power and control and they are pressing that
[2:21:40.380 --> 2:21:46.500]  advantage against us we must break free from these monsters the United States is
[2:21:46.500 --> 2:21:51.060]  not communist China we don't have three million people in concentration camps we
[2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:55.300]  don't blow up churches we don't kill political dissidents and sell their
[2:21:55.300 --> 2:22:01.340]  organs but all over the news we see the UN billable indicates WHO mainstream
[2:22:01.340 --> 2:22:05.980]  corporate media praising communist China for their response and if communist
[2:22:05.980 --> 2:22:09.700]  China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[2:22:09.700 --> 2:22:13.740]  robots controlling people well then gee we've got to do that and on top of it
[2:22:13.740 --> 2:22:17.660]  cities like San Antonio pass laws saying will arrest you if you say Chinese
[2:22:17.660 --> 2:22:21.900]  virus well now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus these
[2:22:21.900 --> 2:22:26.620]  people are out of control control freaks and they are gonna lose big time
[2:22:26.620 --> 2:22:30.780]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing
[2:22:30.780 --> 2:22:35.300]  them in their power grab the resistance lives at bandot video and in full wars
[2:22:35.300 --> 2:22:39.860]  dot com spread those links and jam it down the censors throats and then we'll
[2:22:39.860 --> 2:22:43.860]  be able to defeat their operation that much quicker
[2:22:43.860 --> 2:22:48.380]  holland block has really been a sleeper product for us we got it in a few years

[2:24:13.180 --> 2:24:38.220]  so Laura Loomer in closing you're doing amazing work you've got the system
[2:24:38.220 --> 2:24:42.500]  scared of you obviously there's censorship happening it's an incredible
[2:24:42.500 --> 2:24:48.780]  tyrannical takeover how would you quantify the fight right now for pro human
[2:24:48.780 --> 2:24:55.180]  forces versus forces of tyranny I mean really honestly this is this is a
[2:24:55.180 --> 2:24:59.620]  battle of life or death at this point in time and we see we see that these
[2:24:59.620 --> 2:25:03.060]  communists who were dealing with in big tech they literally want us dead first
[2:25:03.060 --> 2:25:06.300]  they want to try to kill us in a digital manner by subjecting us to a digital
[2:25:06.300 --> 2:25:10.180]  gulag but look what they're doing in the countries which they're outsourcing all
[2:25:10.180 --> 2:25:13.300]  their manufacturing to and in these countries like China where they're
[2:25:13.300 --> 2:25:16.420]  getting all of their executives and people to serve on their board they
[2:25:16.420 --> 2:25:20.380]  literally have Muslims and concentration camps in China and these big tech
[2:25:20.380 --> 2:25:25.060]  social media companies are utilizing slave labor from the Muslim Uighurs to
[2:25:25.060 --> 2:25:29.900]  produce their their products okay so these people really are evil they want
[2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:34.700]  us dead okay they they have demonstrated that in the way that they label us
[2:25:34.700 --> 2:25:38.020]  dangerous individuals and then tell people that it's okay to kill dangerous
[2:25:38.020 --> 2:25:42.820]  individuals so nobody's doing anything about it I completely feel your pain
[2:25:42.820 --> 2:25:47.780]  okay I've expressed the same frustrations and that is why it is so
[2:25:47.780 --> 2:25:52.020]  important that I win okay and I'm going to win it's the only option it is the
[2:25:52.020 --> 2:25:57.020]  only option because if this continues well you know there's really not going
[2:25:57.020 --> 2:26:00.500]  to be in America as you constantly repeat on your show Alex there is not
[2:26:00.500 --> 2:26:05.260]  going to be in America if we allow for these tyrants in Silicon Valley to rob
[2:26:05.260 --> 2:26:11.740]  us of our first amendment right because Laura that's really true big tech
[2:26:11.740 --> 2:26:15.820]  claims it's all liberal and it censors conservatives or Christians because
[2:26:15.820 --> 2:26:20.580]  they're loving meanwhile they help China run death camps that is so sick that is
[2:26:20.580 --> 2:26:25.380]  so crazy that that's who these people are these people are monsters they should
[2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:30.340]  be absolutely called out the FBI should be arresting them yeah they should and
[2:26:30.340 --> 2:26:33.980]  you want to know if we had people in Congress who had a spine and a backbone
[2:26:33.980 --> 2:26:37.780]  to do it it would be happening because it is a crime it is a crime to lie to
[2:26:37.780 --> 2:26:42.940]  Congress okay Sundar Cheryl Sandberg Jack Dorsey Mark Zuckerberg they all
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:46.700]  committed perjury when they testified under oath to Congress when they lied
[2:26:46.700 --> 2:26:49.420]  and said that they don't censor conservatives they were there together
[2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:55.100]  when they said we don't even track users yep and then the day after I called
[2:26:55.100 --> 2:26:59.140]  Jack Dorsey a liar remember remember when I stood up and I was auctioned off by
[2:26:59.140 --> 2:27:02.180]  it was a Republican who auctioned me off by the way representative Billy Long
[2:27:02.180 --> 2:27:05.700]  wasn't a Democrat need to add that in there okay because it's not just the
[2:27:05.700 --> 2:27:11.980]  Democrats you were banned Alex the next day is when you were banned is when
[2:27:11.980 --> 2:27:16.220]  after after we confronted them in Congress they were tallyed against you
[2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:20.860]  by banning you so this is where all these people are vindictive in big tech
[2:27:20.860 --> 2:27:24.380]  okay they are now trying to control our elections they think that they get to
[2:27:24.380 --> 2:27:29.540]  choose election winners and losers and I'm hoping that my election victory
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:33.420]  proves to them that it's the people who decide who wins elections in this
[2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:37.220]  country not the big tech tyrant sitting in their offices in Silicon Valley and
[2:27:37.220 --> 2:27:40.700]  don't you find it really ironic how they ban me they accuse me of being anti
[2:27:40.700 --> 2:27:44.740]  Muslim and an Islamophobe yeah I'm I'm one of the only people who's really
[2:27:44.740 --> 2:27:49.180]  speaking up about the fact that big tech is is partnering with China to
[2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:53.620]  literally put Muslims in concentration camps I mean it's incredible it's
[2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:59.540]  incredible Laura Lummer all right Laura Lummer Laura Lummer for Congress comm people should
[2:27:59.540 --> 2:28:03.180]  support you there please join us again I just want to hear come back come back
[2:28:03.180 --> 2:28:07.220]  next week okay Laura yeah I'd love to I'd love to have you come to Palm Beach to
[2:28:07.220 --> 2:28:10.940]  have an event with me so that we can hear in President Trump's home district
[2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:14.540]  have a big event to raise awareness about tech tyranny Alex because you're
[2:28:14.540 --> 2:28:18.740]  somebody who I admire greatly and I think you're an inspiration and you
[2:28:18.740 --> 2:28:21.540]  really are a free speech hero and you've been trailblazing this from the
[2:28:21.540 --> 2:28:25.620]  beginning so you know please please come to Palm Beach and let's have an event
[2:28:25.620 --> 2:28:29.820]  well try to do that Laura thank you so much all right there goes Laura Lummer
[2:28:29.820 --> 2:28:33.940]  what a day to be here on air I mean this is just totally insane everything
[2:28:33.940 --> 2:28:37.740]  that's happening I want to go to your phone calls right now because I'm gonna
[2:28:37.740 --> 2:28:41.700]  host the whole next hour to and take your calls because your calls are paramount
[2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:46.180]  but man what an attack on free speech and to realize they turn the lights out
[2:28:46.180 --> 2:28:54.660]  right now they could they'd have us off air right now they could all right who's
[2:28:54.660 --> 2:29:02.540]  up first year let's go ahead and talk to
[2:29:06.940 --> 2:29:12.820]  let's talk to Jamal in Canada Jamal's been holding a law enforcement officer
[2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:17.900]  on COVID-19 go ahead how you doing mr. Alex it's the honor and a privilege to be
[2:29:17.900 --> 2:29:25.060]  on your show time brother go ahead awesome um oh I work law enforcement in
[2:29:25.060 --> 2:29:30.660]  Alberta Canada and some of the responses that we've seen in terms of our brass
[2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:36.700]  and the policy let down to frontline workers is outrageous just like your
[2:29:36.700 --> 2:29:40.940]  caller Tom said from Texas I've also noticed that the hospitals they are
[2:29:40.940 --> 2:29:45.780]  completely empty now we deal with a lot of mental health patients bringing them
[2:29:45.780 --> 2:29:51.780]  into hospitals for you know suicidal ideation just mental decline and
[2:29:51.780 --> 2:29:57.340]  typically we'd be waiting on a normal day about four to eight hours nowadays when
[2:29:57.340 --> 2:30:01.740]  we take people down there we're waiting like ten minutes the hospital beds are
[2:30:01.740 --> 2:30:09.340]  empty completely so another thing mr. Jones is that the public safety act that
[2:30:09.340 --> 2:30:15.780]  we have instituted here in Alberta they expect us to cite members of the public
[2:30:15.780 --> 2:30:20.060]  for $1,200 tickets if we see them breaking the stay-at-home orders I
[2:30:20.060 --> 2:30:24.100]  know a lot of fellow officers like myself we do not enforce those
[2:30:24.100 --> 2:30:28.420]  unconstitutional orders we feel that it's a you know a huge government
[2:30:28.420 --> 2:30:33.260]  overreach and it just feels like this is conditioning you know these people are
[2:30:33.260 --> 2:30:40.100]  like you always say control freak and even mr. Trudeau you know our prime
[2:30:40.100 --> 2:30:44.660]  minister who has instituted this gun ban under the guise and under the chaos
[2:30:44.660 --> 2:30:49.940]  of this COVID-19 pandemic therefore people can't protest people are stuck
[2:30:49.940 --> 2:30:53.260]  in their home you know and the only thing you could do nowadays in Canada at
[2:30:53.260 --> 2:30:58.500]  least is sign a petition that doesn't do much so it's just incredible to see you
[2:30:58.500 --> 2:31:02.180]  know some of the responses especially from liberal leadership in North America
[2:31:02.180 --> 2:31:07.940]  Canada and the United States another thing mr. Jones is talking about the
[2:31:07.940 --> 2:31:14.180]  influx of mental health ever since this thing has taken you know grasp of our
[2:31:14.180 --> 2:31:18.860]  of our world I find that you know the last two night shifts that I did we do
[2:31:18.860 --> 2:31:23.780]  12-hour night shifts every single person I've dealt with was experiencing a
[2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:28.380]  mental health decline and I mean a serious mental health decline and I feel
[2:31:28.380 --> 2:31:36.260]  that this is sort of acting as the the breaking point for a lot of people you
[2:31:36.260 --> 2:31:40.220]  know they're making you feel in the media that if you go outside you're
[2:31:40.220 --> 2:31:44.900]  gonna be killed you're gonna be you know this this strange mysterious disease
[2:31:44.900 --> 2:31:47.820]  is gonna get you if you go outside if you interact with your family if you
[2:31:47.820 --> 2:31:52.860]  interact with your friends they're trying to isolate people and I just
[2:31:52.860 --> 2:31:57.660]  think it's well of course there's an attempt right now to totally break
[2:31:57.660 --> 2:32:04.100]  down society and create a total stampede panic and then they count every
[2:32:04.100 --> 2:32:07.900]  death from heart attack cancer you name is this and that's where all this is
[2:32:07.900 --> 2:32:12.100]  going sir absolutely right your your common sense what you're saying Jamal
[2:32:12.100 --> 2:32:15.460]  is absolutely right now you said the other officer say this as well so in the
[2:32:15.460 --> 2:32:21.020]  police on our enemy it's the bureaucracy and it's the centralized lie that has
[2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:24.580]  created this whole hysteria that now says it's not two weeks it's not two
[2:32:24.580 --> 2:32:28.580]  months it's five years it's ten years you never can leave your house again and
[2:32:28.580 --> 2:32:32.380]  this is an obvious takeover plan absolutely right miss don't do you
[2:32:32.380 --> 2:32:37.620]  mind if I just read something quickly to you yes sir go ahead okay so I know
[2:32:37.620 --> 2:32:42.660]  that you said not too long ago on your show you you typically quote this my
[2:32:42.660 --> 2:32:44.740]  people are destroyed for lack of knowledge and I just want to tell
[2:32:44.740 --> 2:32:51.300]  everybody that this info wars calm and video this is that knowledge that you
[2:32:51.300 --> 2:32:55.580]  need this is that knowledge that you're not gonna get from the mainstream that
[2:32:55.580 --> 2:32:58.820]  you're not gonna get from your typical churches that you may attend for the
[2:32:58.820 --> 2:33:04.580]  Christian this is a knowledge that we need to be privy to we need to research
[2:33:04.580 --> 2:33:09.700]  this for ourselves because if we're just naive we're gonna we're gonna be
[2:33:09.700 --> 2:33:14.260]  destroyed folks and what I want to read to you mr. Jones was Matthew 24 30 7 to
[2:33:14.260 --> 2:33:18.860]  39 it says but as it was in the days of Noah so shall be for the coming of the
[2:33:18.860 --> 2:33:21.980]  son of man for as in the days before the flood they were eating drinking
[2:33:21.980 --> 2:33:25.500]  marrying giving into marriage until the day that Noah entered the arc and did
[2:33:25.500 --> 2:33:28.940]  not know until the flood came and took them all away so also will be the
[2:33:28.940 --> 2:33:33.460]  coming of the son of man so mr. Jones like Noah who preached 120 years and
[2:33:33.460 --> 2:33:40.140]  people laughed at him they mocked him you I see you as that preacher who's
[2:33:40.140 --> 2:33:45.140]  giving us facts who's giving us hope who's giving us transparent are 170 days
[2:33:45.140 --> 2:33:50.260]  out from the 2020 election is a referendum of national sovereignty
[2:33:50.260 --> 2:33:54.460]  against globalism and Obama Hillary and the deep state have been caught
[2:33:54.460 --> 2:33:59.060]  attempting to overthrow President Trump's election and they've been caught in
[2:33:59.060 --> 2:34:03.020]  two separate coup attempts against the president now they've been pushing
[2:34:03.020 --> 2:34:07.220]  COVID-19 shut down the economy and created depression well China's already
[2:34:07.220 --> 2:34:11.380]  been open for business for more than a month this is an ongoing globalist
[2:34:11.380 --> 2:34:15.660]  attempt to punish the American people wreck our economy and hope that we
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:19.100]  won't recognize that it is they the new world order that have orchestrated this
[2:34:19.100 --> 2:34:23.900]  and not President Trump they know their crimes are coming out they know the
[2:34:23.900 --> 2:34:28.300]  chickens are coming home to roost so now they're panicking and trying to steal
[2:34:28.300 --> 2:34:33.220]  the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from
[2:34:33.220 --> 2:34:36.780]  COVID-19 the entire COVID-19 system is a giant
[2:34:36.780 --> 2:34:41.980]  hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope so get out there and expose

[2:35:43.580 --> 2:35:48.540]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the
[2:35:48.540 --> 2:35:53.660]  world economy to where it is every economist is on record saying that as
[2:35:53.660 --> 2:35:58.220]  this economy has been shut down for two months it is going to be a death sentence
[2:35:58.220 --> 2:36:02.540]  the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world
[2:36:02.540 --> 2:36:06.620]  and that the general public is going to go into deep deep debt to the mega banks
[2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:12.220]  but I'm gonna have medical ID cards forced inoculations we are now in a
[2:36:12.220 --> 2:36:17.580]  giant dystopia but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major back
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:22.700]  lash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of
[2:36:22.700 --> 2:36:27.420]  rights rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to
[2:36:27.420 --> 2:36:31.660]  people who take this moral high ground and say shut your business down shut your
[2:36:31.660 --> 2:36:36.540]  life down it'll save lives. No it's caused millions to already starve to death tens
[2:36:36.540 --> 2:36:39.780]  of millions more so the cowards who went along with us with your virtue
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:44.740]  signaling you have destroyed your lives and our lives congratulations. Now it's
[2:36:44.740 --> 2:36:49.300]  official the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[2:36:49.300 --> 2:36:54.100]  will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry
[2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:57.940]  cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:37:02.220]  social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you
[2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:07.940]  visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained. Yes
[2:37:07.940 --> 2:37:11.660]  ladies and gentlemen this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[2:37:11.660 --> 2:37:15.940]  out of jail the rapists the child molesters the murderers and where you
[2:37:15.940 --> 2:37:20.900]  are now non-essential and a prisoner. From the beginning of my research it was
[2:37:20.900 --> 2:37:25.620]  clear the globalist are an authoritarian anti-human group. They have to put this
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:30.100]  electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game which is
[2:37:30.100 --> 2:37:36.220]  global depopulation. So you see submitting to them is death the only way
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.780]  to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are
[2:37:40.780 --> 2:37:45.700]  humanity's mortal enemy. Wake up or die.
[2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:51.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:51.700 --> 2:37:55.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:22.700 --> 2:38:25.700]  Seasons don't fear the Reaper.
[2:38:26.700 --> 2:38:30.700]  But you don't have to fear the Reaper.
[2:38:31.700 --> 2:38:35.700]  But you better fear getting your heart right with God.
[2:38:38.700 --> 2:38:41.700]  Alright we're taking your phone calls right now.
[2:38:41.700 --> 2:38:46.700]  Jamal is a law enforcement officer in Canada. He was really hitting it hard
[2:38:46.700 --> 2:38:51.700]  about the spiritual choice that's so clear now.
[2:38:51.700 --> 2:38:54.700]  Things are so clear now. I'm not worried about myself.
[2:38:54.700 --> 2:38:57.700]  I'm just worried about all those we didn't reach.
[2:38:58.700 --> 2:39:04.700]  All those that are going to fall this evil because it's all about to be fulfilled.
[2:39:04.700 --> 2:39:07.700]  So Jamal finish up your points my friend.
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:11.700]  Absolutely Mr. Jones and thank you again.
[2:39:11.700 --> 2:39:15.700]  You know before I even go on I just want to say I want to give you a little
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:20.700]  plug and regrettably so Mr. Jones I started I've been a long time listener
[2:39:20.700 --> 2:39:25.700]  but I've purchased your items and stuff from your store.
[2:39:25.700 --> 2:39:28.700]  It took me a long time to do it and for that I apologize.
[2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:32.700]  It was after YouTube had banned you that I got my button gear
[2:39:32.700 --> 2:39:35.700]  and I knew that I had to put my money where my mouth is.
[2:39:35.700 --> 2:39:38.700]  One of my favorite products is the eight pack power stack.
[2:39:38.700 --> 2:39:41.700]  I recommend it to any frontline workers who do shift work.
[2:39:41.700 --> 2:39:44.700]  You just pop that AM pack in the morning after you wake up after a long night shift
[2:39:44.700 --> 2:39:48.700]  and then if you need to get that rest you get the PM pack and it gives you energy
[2:39:48.700 --> 2:39:52.700]  during the day and good restful night or sleep.
[2:39:52.700 --> 2:39:54.700]  No it is a good product. We just sell good stuff.
[2:39:54.700 --> 2:39:56.700]  That just keeps us on air. I appreciate your brother.
[2:39:56.700 --> 2:39:58.700]  What matters is what you're saying about what you see happening
[2:39:58.700 --> 2:40:02.700]  and the spiritual choice. Tell us about that.
[2:40:02.700 --> 2:40:06.700]  So you know what I was thinking about the story of Noah.
[2:40:06.700 --> 2:40:09.700]  You were talking about that because that's what exactly you think Noah's happy
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:13.700]  when the rain started coming and it's not a good feeling.
[2:40:13.700 --> 2:40:17.700]  And Mr. Jones if you read in Genesis they actually never experienced
[2:40:17.700 --> 2:40:20.700]  water falling from the heavens before.
[2:40:20.700 --> 2:40:22.700]  It came out of the ground.
[2:40:22.700 --> 2:40:25.700]  Exactly. So Noah was, he looked like a crazy man.
[2:40:25.700 --> 2:40:28.700]  He looked like a crazy man and he preached patiently
[2:40:28.700 --> 2:40:31.700]  and he declared his message patiently
[2:40:31.700 --> 2:40:36.700]  and during so much hardship and so much castigation from everyone
[2:40:36.700 --> 2:40:40.700]  from the scientists and the doctors and people that thought they were the experts
[2:40:40.700 --> 2:40:44.700]  and he preached for 120 years and all that he had saved was his family.
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:47.700]  So I hope that I am part of your family Mr. Jones
[2:40:47.700 --> 2:40:52.700]  and we're all under the guys and under the covering of Jesus Christ.
[2:40:52.700 --> 2:40:55.700]  That's the family that we need to be a part of to be saved.
[2:40:55.700 --> 2:40:57.700]  So I thank you, Alex.
[2:40:57.700 --> 2:40:59.700]  What you're right, that is a scary part is that
[2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:02.700]  even as the water was rising they were in denial.
[2:41:02.700 --> 2:41:04.700]  That's right. That's it.
[2:41:04.700 --> 2:41:07.700]  And when the door shut Noah tried to open it
[2:41:07.700 --> 2:41:10.700]  but he couldn't because the angel of God had shut
[2:41:10.700 --> 2:41:13.700]  and what God shuts, no man can open.
[2:41:13.700 --> 2:41:16.700]  So it's just incredible to see what's going on.
[2:41:16.700 --> 2:41:22.700]  Can you imagine what big tech is going to do when all their power is nothing?
[2:41:22.700 --> 2:41:26.700]  Oh man. It's like a wild beast that's being cornered.
[2:41:26.700 --> 2:41:28.700]  They're going to lash out and it's going to be dangerous.
[2:41:28.700 --> 2:41:30.700]  People will die.
[2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:33.700]  It's not going to be, you know, we all live in a bubble.
[2:41:33.700 --> 2:41:36.700]  We all live thinking that we have tomorrow.
[2:41:36.700 --> 2:41:39.700]  We all live thinking that, you know, the status quo,
[2:41:39.700 --> 2:41:42.700]  we're just going to go through our life, retire and, you know,
[2:41:42.700 --> 2:41:44.700]  just keep on reproducing. It's not like...
[2:41:44.700 --> 2:41:47.700]  No, you're right. All that's over. The status quo is gone.
[2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:49.700]  That's it.
[2:41:49.700 --> 2:41:51.700]  God bless you, brother. Great points.
[2:41:51.700 --> 2:41:53.700]  Jamal was an amazing caller. Wow.
[2:41:53.700 --> 2:41:55.700]  Yeah. I don't compare myself to Noah.
[2:41:55.700 --> 2:41:58.700]  I'm like one of the animals trying to get on the boat.
[2:41:58.700 --> 2:42:03.700]  But the globalists believe they're doing this cleansing of humans.
[2:42:03.700 --> 2:42:06.700]  So they say they're getting rid of humanity.
[2:42:06.700 --> 2:42:09.700]  They say they're cleansing the earth for everybody.
[2:42:09.700 --> 2:42:12.700]  Okay. Whatever.
[2:42:12.700 --> 2:42:14.700]  I just know you people are crazy.
[2:42:14.700 --> 2:42:16.700]  They're into this devil worship stuff.
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:19.700]  All right.
[2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:22.700]  Let's just go to the longest.
[2:42:22.700 --> 2:42:24.700]  Let's talk to Jeremy and Texas.
[2:42:24.700 --> 2:42:26.700]  Jeremy, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:42:26.700 --> 2:42:27.700]  Hi, Alex.
[2:42:27.700 --> 2:42:29.700]  Yesterday you had asked the question,
[2:42:29.700 --> 2:42:32.700]  what do you do when you're losing a chess game?
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:34.700]  And there's an old Russian born grandmaster,
[2:42:34.700 --> 2:42:35.700]  civilly,
[2:42:35.700 --> 2:42:39.700]  that said tactics is what you do when there's something to do.
[2:42:39.700 --> 2:42:43.700]  Strategy is what you do when there is nothing to do.
[2:42:43.700 --> 2:42:46.700]  And so this is a very famous chess grandmaster.
[2:42:46.700 --> 2:42:49.700]  And, you know, Laura Loomer kept saying they want to make us dead,
[2:42:49.700 --> 2:42:51.700]  but first they want to make us stupid.
[2:42:51.700 --> 2:42:54.700]  And they do that by infringing on our liberty and pretending that
[2:42:54.700 --> 2:42:58.700]  we have to catch them lying to Congress before we actually catch them in the act of a crime.
[2:42:58.700 --> 2:43:02.700]  And what this is all leading up to right now is that we have,
[2:43:02.700 --> 2:43:05.700]  I'm going to very rural West Texas County,
[2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:07.700]  about 300 miles west of Dallas.
[2:43:07.700 --> 2:43:10.700]  There's three men that make up the sheriff's department.
[2:43:10.700 --> 2:43:13.700]  And so I have a very, you know,
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:16.700]  see-through sort of way of looking at the government here.
[2:43:16.700 --> 2:43:20.700]  And so basically we've already beat the COVID-19 thing to the past.
[2:43:20.700 --> 2:43:21.700]  We've already beat them.
[2:43:21.700 --> 2:43:26.700]  And I say that because what's going on is the governor is basically receiving
[2:43:26.700 --> 2:43:30.700]  some sort of COVID paper, some sort of program, you know,
[2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:33.700]  like what Michigan did, but Texas, you know, kind of modifies it.
[2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:37.700]  And he turns around and hands it to every county attorney in all two and 54 counties.
[2:43:37.700 --> 2:43:39.700]  And they say, implement this.
[2:43:39.700 --> 2:43:42.700]  And the sheriff looks at it and says, I don't think so.
[2:43:42.700 --> 2:43:43.700]  What in the hell is this?
[2:43:43.700 --> 2:43:45.700]  Yeah, there's like no cases here.
[2:43:45.700 --> 2:43:47.700]  Why should I lock it right now?
[2:43:47.700 --> 2:43:49.700]  Zero cases. Zero cases in my county.
[2:43:49.700 --> 2:43:50.700]  Zero.
[2:43:50.700 --> 2:43:53.700]  A county the size of Los Angeles County.
[2:43:53.700 --> 2:43:54.700]  Okay.
[2:43:54.700 --> 2:43:56.700]  Zero cases.
[2:43:56.700 --> 2:43:58.700]  And so they're doing everything in quiet right now.
[2:43:58.700 --> 2:44:00.700]  Many weeks ago when the lockdown started,
[2:44:00.700 --> 2:44:03.700]  all the county officials just went to the government building.
[2:44:03.700 --> 2:44:05.700]  There wasn't really a public notice about it.
[2:44:05.700 --> 2:44:07.700]  They all just went there and the very next day,
[2:44:07.700 --> 2:44:10.700]  every county in Texas was locked down.
[2:44:10.700 --> 2:44:13.700]  And then everybody thought it was really neat that the troopers are all at the borders.
[2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:16.700]  Okay. So here's what I call it that.
[2:44:16.700 --> 2:44:19.700]  The governor had, okay.
[2:44:19.700 --> 2:44:22.700]  So, so I'm across the street from these COVID testing sites right now.
[2:44:22.700 --> 2:44:27.700]  And originally the county attorney told the sheriff, hey,
[2:44:27.700 --> 2:44:30.700]  you're going to make mandatory testing for everyone in the county.
[2:44:30.700 --> 2:44:32.700]  And the sheriff said, get lost.
[2:44:32.700 --> 2:44:34.700]  What he had originally told him though,
[2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:36.700]  was at every county entrance,
[2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:40.700]  there's going to be a mandatory testing site across the state.
[2:44:40.700 --> 2:44:42.700]  And now I want you to understand.
[2:44:42.700 --> 2:44:43.700]  Oh, exactly.
[2:44:43.700 --> 2:44:44.700]  Now that's confirmed.
[2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:46.700]  They gave their wish list,
[2:44:46.700 --> 2:44:49.700]  which is all UN run total control group.
[2:44:49.700 --> 2:44:52.700]  And they're, they're just trying to do this without announcing to the public.
[2:44:52.700 --> 2:44:55.700]  Just by the way, I know you're on your way to work,
[2:44:55.700 --> 2:44:57.700]  but you're going to have to wait here.
[2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:01.700]  And just the craziness of.
[2:45:01.700 --> 2:45:04.700]  I mean, David Ike's talked about it.
[2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:05.700]  A lot of people talked about that.
[2:45:05.700 --> 2:45:08.700]  Well, then they give you a false test and then everybody's infected.
[2:45:08.700 --> 2:45:11.700]  And then everybody's, it's, here's what it's designed to do.
[2:45:11.700 --> 2:45:12.700]  Let me say this.
[2:45:12.700 --> 2:45:15.700]  It's designed to cause a civil war and a breakdown of society.
[2:45:15.700 --> 2:45:17.700]  People go, this doesn't make sense.
[2:45:17.700 --> 2:45:18.700]  It doesn't work.
[2:45:18.700 --> 2:45:21.700]  It's designed to cause a civil war.
[2:45:21.700 --> 2:45:24.700]  And so when I say, don't kill the cops at the checkpoint,
[2:45:24.700 --> 2:45:27.700]  it's not some wimpy kiss their ass thing.
[2:45:27.700 --> 2:45:29.700]  It's don't do what they want folks.
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:32.700]  They want, this is the sabotage.
[2:45:32.700 --> 2:45:33.700]  This is the fear.
[2:45:33.700 --> 2:45:34.700]  This is don't trust anybody.
[2:45:34.700 --> 2:45:37.700]  But what CNN says, this is their big move.
[2:45:37.700 --> 2:45:42.700]  And I got to say.
[2:45:42.700 --> 2:45:47.700]  Trump buying into the force inoculation and all these ideas is a really bad thing.
[2:45:47.700 --> 2:45:49.700]  Why do you think Trump's doing that?
[2:45:49.700 --> 2:45:52.700]  And Alex, a Democrat sheriff told the governor, no.
[2:45:52.700 --> 2:45:55.700]  So think about the wins, you know, as Texas goes, so goes.
[2:45:55.700 --> 2:45:57.700]  No, no, no, no, I mean, I agree.
[2:45:57.700 --> 2:46:02.700]  Every citizen needs to go see their sheriff right now and say, we're not a bunch of wimps.
[2:46:02.700 --> 2:46:04.700]  This is an economic warfare weapon.
[2:46:04.700 --> 2:46:05.700]  Stop virtue.
[2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:06.700]  I agree.
[2:46:06.700 --> 2:46:11.700]  We need to tell them do not compliance with this is death.
[2:46:11.700 --> 2:46:12.700]  Exactly.
[2:46:12.700 --> 2:46:17.700]  And I have one thing to ask you about of a piece of Intel I have received back in 2004,
[2:46:17.700 --> 2:46:20.700]  six years before I started watching enforce.
[2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:25.700]  And it is about a facility at the University of North Texas at George Bush funding.
[2:46:25.700 --> 2:46:29.700]  And evidently, it's a Pico technology lab, one of only two in the nation.
[2:46:29.700 --> 2:46:32.700]  I don't know if you'd heard anything about that.
[2:46:32.700 --> 2:46:33.700]  No, I don't.
[2:46:33.700 --> 2:46:37.700]  Man, they got a bunch of super evil stuff going on at these research laboratories.
[2:46:37.700 --> 2:46:43.700]  Just share with you that that lab is a nanotech lab. And what I was told then is that they
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:48.700]  were engineering viruses that they control via some sort of internet where they could
[2:46:48.700 --> 2:46:51.700]  activate it in certain races or deactivate it whenever they want to.
[2:46:51.700 --> 2:46:53.700]  And they were already having ethics meetings about all this.
[2:46:53.700 --> 2:46:57.700]  I was told this in 2004 by a grad student who was working in the lab.
[2:46:57.700 --> 2:47:00.700]  Yeah, you're talking about nanotech viruses.
[2:47:00.700 --> 2:47:01.700]  Right.
[2:47:01.700 --> 2:47:04.700]  And they're engineering these things to be hooked up through the internet.
[2:47:04.700 --> 2:47:07.700]  At least that's what the ethics meetings are surrounding their debates around.
[2:47:07.700 --> 2:47:12.700]  I knew a space aeronautics professor at NASA who told me this 20 years ago and I thought
[2:47:12.700 --> 2:47:13.700]  he was crazy.
[2:47:13.700 --> 2:47:19.700]  And then I was talking yesterday to a former head of a U.S. intelligence agency.
[2:47:19.700 --> 2:47:20.700]  He was telling me the same thing.
[2:47:20.700 --> 2:47:21.700]  That's what I mean.
[2:47:21.700 --> 2:47:24.700]  Like we've been given Atlantis power.
[2:47:24.700 --> 2:47:26.700]  We've been given like God like power.
[2:47:26.700 --> 2:47:27.700]  We're not God.
[2:47:27.700 --> 2:47:29.700]  So it's an explosive moment.
[2:47:29.700 --> 2:47:31.700]  I appreciate your call, Jeremy.
[2:47:31.700 --> 2:47:32.700]  Great points.
[2:47:32.700 --> 2:47:37.700]  All right, Vanessa, Austin, Heather, Kathleen, Scott, Steven.
[2:47:37.700 --> 2:47:41.700]  We're going to take all your calls when we come back.
[2:47:41.700 --> 2:47:48.700]  And with one minute or 40 seconds to break, I'm just going to throw this out there.
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:52.700]  I'm promoting and selling things that are good products.
[2:47:52.700 --> 2:47:55.700]  We have a big sale that ends this weekend.
[2:47:55.700 --> 2:47:58.700]  It's 30 to 70% off all the products.
[2:47:58.700 --> 2:48:00.700]  That's how you fund us.
[2:48:00.700 --> 2:48:01.700]  All these products are great.
[2:48:01.700 --> 2:48:03.700]  If you believe in the products, that's great.
[2:48:03.700 --> 2:48:04.700]  If you don't want to buy them, that's fine.
[2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:06.700]  But I would take action.
[2:48:06.700 --> 2:48:08.700]  I'll get those products now.
[2:48:08.700 --> 2:48:15.700]  All right, we're going to start the fourth hour in T minus three minutes.
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:21.700]  We're going to go right to your phone calls one after the other at 877-789-2539.
[2:48:21.700 --> 2:48:24.700]  877-789-Alex.
[2:48:24.700 --> 2:48:34.700]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:36.700]  This is the end, my friends.
[2:48:36.700 --> 2:48:38.700]  My only friends, the end.
[2:48:38.700 --> 2:48:40.700]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:44.700]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[2:48:44.700 --> 2:48:46.700]  The safety, the delusion.
[2:48:46.700 --> 2:48:52.700]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because there was only the mirage of safety.
[2:48:52.700 --> 2:48:58.700]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[2:48:58.700 --> 2:49:02.700]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[2:49:02.700 --> 2:49:05.700]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[2:49:05.700 --> 2:49:09.700]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[2:49:09.700 --> 2:49:14.700]  they were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interest
[2:49:14.700 --> 2:49:18.700]  and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[2:49:18.700 --> 2:49:20.700]  We are repeating that again today.
[2:49:20.700 --> 2:49:26.700]  We're going to apply it and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[2:49:26.700 --> 2:49:29.700]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:34.700]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:34.700 --> 2:49:39.700]  Info wars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom,
[2:49:39.700 --> 2:49:42.700]  but worldwide Maverick spirit.
[2:49:42.700 --> 2:49:47.700]  It's not just myself or the host at Info Wars or the researchers or the journalists.
[2:49:47.700 --> 2:49:51.700]  The activists, the people on the front lines in the arena.
[2:49:51.700 --> 2:49:57.700]  It's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make Info Wars so special
[2:49:57.700 --> 2:50:00.700]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:03.700]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world,
[2:50:03.700 --> 2:50:08.700]  not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations,
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:11.700]  the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group and other globalists.
[2:50:11.700 --> 2:50:16.700]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond
[2:50:16.700 --> 2:50:19.700]  based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[2:50:19.700 --> 2:50:24.700]  Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves, project their hate onto us
[2:50:24.700 --> 2:50:26.700]  and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[2:50:26.700 --> 2:50:30.700]  I'm really excited to know that Info Wars has your support
[2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:57.700]  and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[2:51:01.700 --> 2:51:05.700]  Who's been holding the longest? Is it Catherine?
[2:51:05.700 --> 2:51:09.700]  Is it Heather? Is it Austin? Is it Vanessa?
[2:51:09.700 --> 2:51:12.700]  Is it Scotty or is it Steven?
[2:51:12.700 --> 2:51:15.700]  I think it's Heather than Vanessa.
[2:51:15.700 --> 2:51:18.700]  Heather, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome.
[2:51:18.700 --> 2:51:20.700]  Holy shit, Alex. Is this really you?
[2:51:20.700 --> 2:51:23.700]  Yes, ma'am. Good talking to you. Go ahead.
[2:51:23.700 --> 2:51:28.700]  I am so happy to talk with you. Thank you. Our country's in an attack by the White House.
[2:51:28.700 --> 2:51:31.700]  No, you are. Go ahead. Tell me what's going on.
[2:51:31.700 --> 2:51:36.700]  Our country's been in an attack for four years. It's undeniable.
[2:51:36.700 --> 2:51:38.700]  And I don't understand what's going on here.
[2:51:38.700 --> 2:51:42.700]  Our republic is under attack. Everything is crazy.
[2:51:42.700 --> 2:51:46.700]  I don't want a vaccine. I don't want to be scammed.
[2:51:46.700 --> 2:51:54.700]  I think they're taking our DNA and changing our shit. Not good.
[2:51:54.700 --> 2:52:00.700]  I hear you, Heather. So what works at a dental office manager? What's going on?
[2:52:00.700 --> 2:52:08.700]  I haven't known anybody that's been...has an issue. None of my co-workers have.
[2:52:08.700 --> 2:52:13.700]  Nothing. Martin County is pretty much being pretty good.
[2:52:13.700 --> 2:52:16.700]  No, that's what everybody's saying, Heather. I appreciate your call.
[2:52:16.700 --> 2:52:20.700]  Vanessa, in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:52:20.700 --> 2:52:24.700]  Hey, Alex. Thank you for letting me come on. I'm excited to be able to share.
[2:52:24.700 --> 2:52:28.700]  Because I work right next to the Life Care Center in Kirkland.
[2:52:28.700 --> 2:52:34.700]  And I work for orthopedic surgeons, which is an elective surgery for the most part.
[2:52:34.700 --> 2:52:37.700]  But a lot of our patients did come from that center.
[2:52:37.700 --> 2:52:40.700]  Well, tell us what you're saying. What are your things going on?
[2:52:40.700 --> 2:52:46.700]  Well, initially, about two months ago, when the first, you know, when everything started happening,
[2:52:46.700 --> 2:52:52.700]  I was actually told by my administrator that if I open one of our patients' charts,
[2:52:52.700 --> 2:52:57.700]  and I see that pulmonary hospitalization is marked on their chart,
[2:52:57.700 --> 2:53:02.700]  my account will be flagged as my job will be in jeopardy.
[2:53:02.700 --> 2:53:08.700]  So that was a major scare for me because that just meant like if I have a patient coming in
[2:53:08.700 --> 2:53:12.700]  and I'm supposed to possibly cast this patient or, you know,
[2:53:12.700 --> 2:53:17.700]  our patient care to this patient, and I see that they have pulmonary issues
[2:53:17.700 --> 2:53:22.700]  or pulmonary hospitalization like three days ago in their chart,
[2:53:22.700 --> 2:53:24.700]  I could possibly be at risk.
[2:53:24.700 --> 2:53:27.700]  And this is before I knew anything about the virus, of course.
[2:53:27.700 --> 2:53:31.700]  Person, why would they tell you that if you saw something in a chart that was already,
[2:53:31.700 --> 2:53:35.700]  they're saying, don't look at this or don't explain that to us?
[2:53:35.700 --> 2:53:37.700]  What does that mean?
[2:53:37.700 --> 2:53:42.700]  Well, they said that since I am working in elective surgery,
[2:53:42.700 --> 2:53:47.700]  I have no reason to open that chart and that they have escalated or elevated the security,
[2:53:47.700 --> 2:53:53.700]  basically, that they have flagged all of the charts that were positive for COVID-19.
[2:53:53.700 --> 2:53:55.700]  They flagged them all.
[2:53:55.700 --> 2:53:59.700]  So anybody that opens those charts is going to be tracked and talked to
[2:53:59.700 --> 2:54:06.700]  if they are not working with pulmonary hospital, you know, in the hospital with that exact...
[2:54:06.700 --> 2:54:10.700]  Sure. So most people haven't been a medical worker or somebody doing charts.
[2:54:10.700 --> 2:54:12.700]  Explain what this means.
[2:54:12.700 --> 2:54:21.700]  So for me, if I open up a chart, I normally have to prepare for the patients coming in the next day.
[2:54:21.700 --> 2:54:26.700]  So I have multiple patients actually that were flagged as COVID-19 patients
[2:54:26.700 --> 2:54:30.700]  because I work right there next to, you know, the Life Care Center.
[2:54:30.700 --> 2:54:38.700]  And it wouldn't allow me to prepare myself or to even check to see if they tested positive for the virus.
[2:54:38.700 --> 2:54:45.700]  So it's going to expose all of us that were working in the surgery center that I work at
[2:54:45.700 --> 2:54:48.700]  without us even being allowed to protect ourselves.
[2:54:48.700 --> 2:54:53.700]  We were told that there wasn't enough PPE for us, for all of us, and basically...
[2:54:53.700 --> 2:54:55.700]  So what's your bottom line, Vanessa?
[2:54:55.700 --> 2:54:57.700]  What do you think is really going on here?
[2:54:57.700 --> 2:55:03.700]  Well, I think that, honestly, I believe that you are definitely right with, you know,
[2:55:03.700 --> 2:55:06.700]  them trying to make sure that COVID-19 spread.
[2:55:06.700 --> 2:55:13.700]  I also am kind of questioning about the 5G because we are right next to two huge 5G powers.
[2:55:13.700 --> 2:55:18.700]  So I'm working along with a thought of David Ike, what he has to say.
[2:55:18.700 --> 2:55:22.700]  I was told I couldn't wear your mask, you know, the Info Wars.
[2:55:22.700 --> 2:55:23.700]  Oh boy.
[2:55:23.700 --> 2:55:24.700]  I couldn't wear that.
[2:55:24.700 --> 2:55:27.700]  I can't wear your mask in my work.
[2:55:27.700 --> 2:55:31.700]  Even if we have Friday casual day, I can't wear any of your attire.
[2:55:31.700 --> 2:55:33.700]  So that was another big deal.
[2:55:33.700 --> 2:55:35.700]  And then one other thing.
[2:55:35.700 --> 2:55:41.700]  My physician that I work under, he has no history of having blood clots with any of his surgical patients.
[2:55:41.700 --> 2:55:57.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:55:57.700 --> 2:56:05.700]  Okay, we're taking your phone calls right now on this live Friday, May 15th global transmission.
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:11.700]  That Catherine, we got Elvis, we got Austin, we got Scotty, we got Steven and many other folks.
[2:56:11.700 --> 2:56:13.700]  We're gonna be taking your calls.
[2:56:13.700 --> 2:56:15.700]  What do you make of COVID-19?
[2:56:15.700 --> 2:56:17.700]  You're medical workers, you have family that are medical workers.
[2:56:17.700 --> 2:56:21.700]  What is really behind all this hysteria?
[2:56:21.700 --> 2:56:27.700]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Wisconsin with Catherine.
[2:56:27.700 --> 2:56:28.700]  Catherine, go ahead.
[2:56:28.700 --> 2:56:29.700]  Thanks for calling.
[2:56:29.700 --> 2:56:36.700]  Hi, Alex, first, I just want to say thank you for putting yourself out there and for what you do and for waking up people.
[2:56:36.700 --> 2:56:38.700]  I appreciate you for what you do, Catherine.
[2:56:38.700 --> 2:56:39.700]  Go ahead.
[2:56:39.700 --> 2:56:40.700]  Thank you.
[2:56:40.700 --> 2:56:46.700]  So like so many people have said, and you've heard, I've got a sister who is an occupational therapist at the local hospital.
[2:56:46.700 --> 2:56:52.700]  And since the end of March, she's been furloughed one to two times a week because of this.
[2:56:52.700 --> 2:57:00.700]  And the week before Easter, they had a huge meeting telling the employees that the next week that was going to be the big week.
[2:57:00.700 --> 2:57:02.700]  There was going to be a huge peak.
[2:57:02.700 --> 2:57:05.700]  Well, that week came and went and there was no peak.
[2:57:05.700 --> 2:57:15.700]  I talked to her yesterday and she told me that their hospital is now starting to break down their mobile testing stations because people aren't coming in.
[2:57:15.700 --> 2:57:28.700]  And I myself have an appointment scheduled for next week. And when I spoke to the nurse yesterday, I was told, if I don't take a COVID test, I can't have my procedure.
[2:57:28.700 --> 2:57:38.700]  So now I'm wondering if they're going to start making people, you know, if you want to get a procedure done, you need to have a test or you need to get a vaccine done.
[2:57:38.700 --> 2:57:46.700]  You've got to have it. You've got to have the test of the vaccine and the test is ready to say everybody has it, which again, boosts the numbers as this is all about.
[2:57:46.700 --> 2:57:51.700]  Well, and that's what I'm worried about. I don't want to be a number because I have no reason to get tested.
[2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:56.700]  I told the nurse I have no symptoms. I haven't been sick.
[2:57:56.700 --> 2:57:59.700]  You know, why is that? And she said, well, it's to protect the doctors.
[2:57:59.700 --> 2:58:03.700]  And I said, well, do the doctors get tested before procedures?
[2:58:03.700 --> 2:58:07.700]  And she honestly told me no, they don't unless they have symptoms.
[2:58:07.700 --> 2:58:15.700]  Well, then Catherine, if I was you and I get I had my bicep ripped, I had a hernia two years ago, I get people have surgeries.
[2:58:15.700 --> 2:58:24.700]  I would just wait and say, OK, you know what? I'm canceling it then. Let them know because they're trying to make you submit to whatever some bioethics board above them said I would.
[2:58:24.700 --> 2:58:27.700]  I would say, you know what? That I'm doing this procedure right now.
[2:58:27.700 --> 2:58:33.700]  No, and I agree. I talked to my dad about it was a position and he said the same thing.
[2:58:33.700 --> 2:58:35.700]  Yeah, I just don't get it.
[2:58:35.700 --> 2:58:39.700]  And that's it. I mean, and look, we all have surgeries. Again, I've had three of them the last couple years.
[2:58:39.700 --> 2:58:47.700]  But if they're going to play those games like because again, they're being told by the hospital, get us higher covid numbers, even though they know the test or a fraud.
[2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:50.700]  Which again, why did Fauci agree to a test that's fraudulent?
[2:58:50.700 --> 2:58:52.700]  Because it's a boost in numbers.
[2:58:52.700 --> 2:58:59.700]  So I completely agree with you. And like I said, that's why I don't want to be a part of that number because it's a forced test.
[2:58:59.700 --> 2:59:01.700]  It's not something that I would.
[2:59:01.700 --> 2:59:06.700]  Catherine, this is just intelligence to the crowd of you, your father, of us. We all have the same opinion.
[2:59:06.700 --> 2:59:12.700]  Humans get intelligence. We're smart. We have to go with what we know and say no to this.
[2:59:12.700 --> 2:59:17.700]  So in the final equation, Catherine, what do you think's really going on? I see a big giant power grab.
[2:59:17.700 --> 2:59:29.700]  Oh, I agree. I actually had labs done last week and I had a CT scan and a scoping done and I asked the nurses and the people working, you know, if I can ask you a question, you don't have to answer it.
[2:59:29.700 --> 2:59:35.700]  If you don't want to, what do you think about this? Have you done anything different with your daily life?
[2:59:35.700 --> 2:59:47.700]  And every single person I talked to, it was the same thing. We haven't done anything different. We don't understand what is going on.
[2:59:47.700 --> 2:59:59.700]  Again, I've opened the phones up for weeks and it's in the news too. And all these medical doctors and nurses go, we're not seeing this. It's all a hoax. God bless you.
[2:59:59.700 --> 3:00:08.700]  And it doesn't mean there aren't regular deaths. See, this is a really smart conspiracy because there are 30, 40,000 flu deaths every year in the U.S.
[3:00:08.700 --> 3:00:16.700]  There are probably 200,000 deaths from pneumonia every year. I mean, pneumonia is a grim reaper killer, folks. Let's not lie about that.
[3:00:16.700 --> 3:00:29.700]  But now, if you can then say every death is this new virus, you create panic and you create an economic shutdown.
[3:00:29.700 --> 3:00:36.700]  And that's all this is. I mean, I remember six years ago, I've told this story a thousand times probably because it gets to me.
[3:00:36.700 --> 3:00:47.700]  I mean, I love my mom's brother, man. He was so cool. He was like a real man. You know what I mean? Like, this is somebody in my family that's as tough as I am or as tougher.
[3:00:47.700 --> 3:00:59.700]  That pneumonia killed him better than a hammer and killed his son and my dad's uncle in the same month.
[3:00:59.700 --> 3:01:12.700]  So I know these pneumonias are serious. But this whole thing is made up. This whole thing is a hysteria attributing all the regular pneumonias and all the regular things that are part of death.
[3:01:12.700 --> 3:01:22.700]  It's part of life. Yeah, we were coming in. We're going out, man. People dying all the place. And it's this new thing. Oh my gosh, we can't have somebody die.
[3:01:22.700 --> 3:01:33.700]  It's never before happened. Oh, we got to shut everything down because nobody can die. Everybody's going to die.
[3:01:33.700 --> 3:01:47.700]  And like I said, if they had a vaccine for pneumonia or the flu or tetanus or if that if that vaccine was safe, I'd take 100 vaccines.
[3:01:47.700 --> 3:01:57.700]  I mean, I'm a technology guy like computers and airplanes and science and I've got an infection. Antibiotics work.
[3:01:57.700 --> 3:02:05.700]  I know they're toxic. I know they've got problems. I know they make the bugs more powerful, but I'll gobble them. Antibiotics all gobble them.
[3:02:05.700 --> 3:02:14.700]  If you've got a vaccine makes me not get some disease, give it to me. But it doesn't work. The numbers show it doesn't work.
[3:02:14.700 --> 3:02:21.700]  The facts show it doesn't work. So you're not going to give me something that doesn't work.
[3:02:21.700 --> 3:02:30.700]  And then piss down my back and tell me it's rain. We're going to go to break. I'm going to come back with Scotty and Steven and Austin and Elvis.
[3:02:30.700 --> 3:02:42.700]  And the last segment of the sound will air a special report and then I'll ensure it's going to take over. But this is one hell of a time to be alive.
[3:02:42.700 --> 3:02:50.700]  And I I'm not some goody two shoes.
[3:02:50.700 --> 3:03:01.700]  And by that I mean I'm not some fake guy that sits up here and says I care about people because it makes me sound like a big loving liberal fake man.
[3:03:01.700 --> 3:03:06.700]  Like I'm trying to con some chick at the park to go to bed with me at that. No, no, no.
[3:03:06.700 --> 3:03:12.700]  I do not like starving people to death. I do not like destroying civilizations.
[3:03:12.700 --> 3:03:35.700]  I didn't ask for it. And I mean, I feel ashamed of myself that I'm not militarily going after the globalist right now when they are cutting off the economy, the whole economy for the third world
[3:03:35.700 --> 3:03:40.700]  and killing tens of millions of people right now.
[3:03:40.700 --> 3:03:46.700]  Because the dominoes that have been set in motion in the economy are going to kill a lot of people.
[3:03:46.700 --> 3:03:54.700]  And I can act like I don't know that and kind of distract myself and oh, well, whatever. It's just how the world works, you know, they're poor people.
[3:03:54.700 --> 3:04:06.700]  But if I had a chance to save them and I didn't do it, then it's on me. And that's really where I am.
[3:04:06.700 --> 3:04:12.700]  So now I'm kind of like looking at Bill Gates and the Clintons and people going.
[3:04:12.700 --> 3:04:15.700]  And it kind of goes to that next phase.
[3:04:15.700 --> 3:04:19.700]  Like I feel guilty. I'm not doing something to save people.
[3:04:19.700 --> 3:04:24.700]  And so my brain starts going like, OK, you done all this stuff politically.
[3:04:24.700 --> 3:04:28.700]  You done all this economically.
[3:04:28.700 --> 3:04:33.700]  And now my brain is like, hey, man, you better get your ass together.
[3:04:33.700 --> 3:04:35.700]  You better start getting ready for war.
[3:04:35.700 --> 3:04:43.700]  And now all these parts of my brain are like one switch is like switch, switch, switch, switch, switch, switches are being flipped.
[3:04:43.700 --> 3:04:59.700]  And I can tell you, not only my switches are being flipped right now, a lot of people's switches are being flipped because we stand down while they kill hundreds of millions of people.
[3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:07.700]  When our little soul like a moth to flame flies up to meet God, the door is going to be closed.
[3:05:07.700 --> 3:05:14.700]  So I must buy the once violence. I must buy the once death. I was telling everybody right now.
[3:05:14.700 --> 3:05:19.700]  You don't make a decision which side you're on. You're damned to hell.
[3:05:19.700 --> 3:05:21.700]  And that's what I'm coming down to here.
[3:05:21.700 --> 3:05:28.700]  Because let me tell you, this this lockdown is probably going to kill a billion people.
[3:05:28.700 --> 3:05:37.700]  And that's a billion people crying to death at night for their mommy and ain't nobody coming to save them.
[3:05:37.700 --> 3:05:43.700]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[3:05:43.700 --> 3:05:45.700]  I believe in God and I believe in the long run.
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:49.700]  It'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[3:05:49.700 --> 3:05:53.700]  I understand what comes around, what goes around, what you say, and I live that.
[3:05:53.700 --> 3:05:55.700]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[3:05:55.700 --> 3:06:01.700]  Now, if I would have hiked up the virus, it was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did.
[3:06:01.700 --> 3:06:05.700]  I've sold five times more supplements. But you know what? I didn't do that.
[3:06:05.700 --> 3:06:11.700]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient. People are deficient.
[3:06:11.700 --> 3:06:15.700]  And I had died and so many other issues. You need those products regardless.
[3:06:15.700 --> 3:06:23.700]  So when we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion, all the other products, I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off
[3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:30.700]  because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies' defenses.
[3:06:30.700 --> 3:06:35.700]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storeable food now.
[3:06:37.700 --> 3:06:42.700]  What Info Wars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth,
[3:06:42.700 --> 3:06:46.700]  has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[3:06:46.700 --> 3:06:50.700]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[3:06:50.700 --> 3:06:58.700]  And now, open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[3:06:58.700 --> 3:07:03.700]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[3:07:03.700 --> 3:07:06.700]  You must decide which side you're on.
[3:07:06.700 --> 3:07:09.700]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome.
[3:07:09.700 --> 3:07:15.700]  Learned out was this will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[3:07:15.700 --> 3:07:19.700]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:22.700]  The delusions must end now.
[3:07:22.700 --> 3:07:27.700]  Info Wars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[3:07:27.700 --> 3:07:31.700]  Most people that are aware of the new will order decided to join it out of fear.
[3:07:31.700 --> 3:07:50.700]  They are truly foos. We must fight this or lose our souls.
[3:08:02.700 --> 3:08:07.700]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Let's talk to Elvis in Canada.
[3:08:07.700 --> 3:08:12.700]  Elvis, you're an EMT on COVID-19. Go ahead, sir. Thanks for calling.
[3:08:12.700 --> 3:08:18.700]  Hey, Alex. Shout out to Daniel, a friend of mine who's sick right now, of course, not with COVID.
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:22.700]  And shout out to John McAfee's anti-globalist cryptocurrency.
[3:08:22.700 --> 3:08:27.700]  But I have a two-part question, slightly off topic.
[3:08:27.700 --> 3:08:32.700]  I heard you recently talking about the Baphomet on your television show,
[3:08:32.700 --> 3:08:36.700]  and I was wondering, what is it about this?
[3:08:36.700 --> 3:08:40.700]  Because I noticed that my friends have seen this on their trips,
[3:08:40.700 --> 3:08:48.700]  and I've also noticed that the Baphomet's been in Albert Pike's writings, and I've been very interested.
[3:08:48.700 --> 3:08:55.700]  Well, when you take hardcore hallucinogens and you break the veil, because God protects us from that,
[3:08:55.700 --> 3:09:02.700]  we're at the third dimension, which is the dimension above hell and below heaven.
[3:09:02.700 --> 3:09:12.700]  And so Baphomet looks like a goat, but it's more like a goat-like creature.
[3:09:12.700 --> 3:09:18.700]  But the people that have studied it look at it, and that's just kind of what the aliens look like.
[3:09:18.700 --> 3:09:26.700]  I mean, look, I'm not somebody even promoting this. This is what people actually see on the hallucinogens,
[3:09:26.700 --> 3:09:28.700]  and it's what the devil worshipers worship.
[3:09:28.700 --> 3:09:37.700]  And so the devil worshipers are just constantly on drugs trying to get divine empowerment from these creatures.
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:39.700]  Does that make sense?
[3:09:39.700 --> 3:09:47.700]  Yeah, because when he said it, he said he felt like he was breaking the veil between whatever this dimension is and the next dimension.
[3:09:47.700 --> 3:09:54.700]  It felt almost like it was like a molestation, you know, like it wasn't right.
[3:09:54.700 --> 3:10:00.700]  Well, no, that's it.
[3:10:00.700 --> 3:10:03.700]  Exactly. If you break the lower dimension, they rape you.
[3:10:03.700 --> 3:10:08.700]  And in fact, that's what it is, is that it's a psychic sexual attack.
[3:10:08.700 --> 3:10:12.700]  That's what Satanism is, is a raping.
[3:10:12.700 --> 3:10:16.700]  That's actually pretty insane.
[3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:18.700]  That's what it is, man.
[3:10:18.700 --> 3:10:22.700]  Believe me, I've seen it.
[3:10:22.700 --> 3:10:30.700]  Do you give any credence to the theory that Jews were involved in the 9-11 attack?
[3:10:30.700 --> 3:10:35.700]  Yeah, I mean, I think there's a large contingent that you could call Jewish.
[3:10:35.700 --> 3:10:37.700]  There's contingents of every group.
[3:10:37.700 --> 3:10:43.700]  But yeah, Jews are a very powerful, mystic, connected group, so a lot of them fall on the dark side.
[3:10:43.700 --> 3:10:49.700]  There's a lot of Jews that are opposing it, but yeah, obviously there's Jews involved in the dark side.
[3:10:49.700 --> 3:10:52.700]  You're absolutely right about that.
[3:10:52.700 --> 3:10:54.700]  Okay, thank you very much.
[3:10:54.700 --> 3:10:59.700]  And also shout out to you, Alex, you're the fucking man.
[3:10:59.700 --> 3:11:01.700]  All right, Elvis, I appreciate your call.
[3:11:01.700 --> 3:11:05.700]  You know, we are on over 200 radio stations and a bunch of cable and DV stations.
[3:11:05.700 --> 3:11:06.700]  We can't cuss.
[3:11:06.700 --> 3:11:09.700]  It's not that I can't handle you guys saying cuss words.
[3:11:09.700 --> 3:11:14.700]  We can't put that on the radio stations and TV stations.
[3:11:14.700 --> 3:11:17.700]  The Democrats can get up there and cuss on TV all day.
[3:11:17.700 --> 3:11:20.700]  Our stations get fines when you do it.
[3:11:20.700 --> 3:11:21.700]  You're like, well, that's not fair.
[3:11:21.700 --> 3:11:23.700]  Yeah, the world's not fair.
[3:11:23.700 --> 3:11:25.700]  Scotty in Tennessee.
[3:11:25.700 --> 3:11:26.700]  Scotty, you're on the air.
[3:11:26.700 --> 3:11:27.700]  Thanks for holding.
[3:11:27.700 --> 3:11:28.700]  You're amazing.
[3:11:28.700 --> 3:11:29.700]  Go ahead.
[3:11:29.700 --> 3:11:38.700]  I wanted to talk to you about my girlfriend works for a major medical university that owns numerous hospitals.
[3:11:38.700 --> 3:11:49.700]  Now, these nurses and these ladies are threatened on a daily basis and not talk about any of the numbers, not talk about having no patients.
[3:11:49.700 --> 3:11:52.700]  They are laid off and furloughed.
[3:11:52.700 --> 3:11:55.700]  They're being threatened on a daily basis.
[3:11:55.700 --> 3:12:08.700]  The hospitals are even sending out messages on their computers, trying to trick them into opening them so they can fire them and do away with their jobs.
[3:12:08.700 --> 3:12:12.700]  Brother, I know it's a total predatory move.
[3:12:12.700 --> 3:12:13.700]  Isn't it incredible?
[3:12:13.700 --> 3:12:15.700]  What does that mean?
[3:12:15.700 --> 3:12:17.700]  I don't just tell you that to impress you.
[3:12:17.700 --> 3:12:22.700]  I even had family call me up last week and say they figured out you're our family.
[3:12:22.700 --> 3:12:23.700]  Don't say this.
[3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:27.700]  But they're literally in an open hospital watching Netflix all day.
[3:12:27.700 --> 3:12:29.700]  My family said we were drinking vodka.
[3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:34.700]  And the media is like, oh, Joan says his family's drinking vodka watching TV.
[3:12:34.700 --> 3:12:40.700]  That's what they're doing at the most at the biggest VA hospital in the damn country, brother.
[3:12:40.700 --> 3:12:45.700]  Okay, the reason that they're doing this out is they're trying to bankrupt the system.
[3:12:45.700 --> 3:12:48.700]  If they can bankrupt the hospitals, control the hospitals.
[3:12:48.700 --> 3:12:50.700]  The government has one leg up.
[3:12:50.700 --> 3:12:51.700]  They have control.
[3:12:51.700 --> 3:12:53.700]  No, you're right. Exactly.
[3:12:53.700 --> 3:12:54.700]  Because exactly.
[3:12:54.700 --> 3:12:56.700]  And that makes the hospitals count.
[3:12:56.700 --> 3:13:00.700]  Everybody's COVID to try to get money to keep from going bankrupt.
[3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:01.700]  Exactly.
[3:13:01.700 --> 3:13:03.700]  And one more thing I want to throw out there out there.
[3:13:03.700 --> 3:13:07.700]  I'm surprised that you or some of your listeners hasn't ruined a lot yet.
[3:13:07.700 --> 3:13:09.700]  It's just like this food stamp program.
[3:13:09.700 --> 3:13:10.700]  You know, it could be a great thing.
[3:13:10.700 --> 3:13:12.700]  But right now they're maximizing the benefit.
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:13.700]  Okay.
[3:13:13.700 --> 3:13:15.700]  People are going out.
[3:13:15.700 --> 3:13:17.700]  They're buying up this food on these food stamps and stuff.
[3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:18.700]  And I know it can be a great thing.
[3:13:18.700 --> 3:13:19.700]  Don't get me wrong.
[3:13:19.700 --> 3:13:20.700]  There's people that are truly doing this.
[3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:23.700]  No, but it's definitely being abused.
[3:13:23.700 --> 3:13:24.700]  Right.
[3:13:24.700 --> 3:13:25.700]  Right.
[3:13:25.700 --> 3:13:26.700]  Okay.
[3:13:26.700 --> 3:13:28.700]  These schools are giving away food in the area.
[3:13:28.700 --> 3:13:31.700]  I mean, they're giving away so much food that they're throwing it away.
[3:13:31.700 --> 3:13:36.700]  What these people, a lot of these people that are getting these benefits and stuff don't
[3:13:36.700 --> 3:13:37.700]  even know how to handle it.
[3:13:37.700 --> 3:13:39.700]  They got food going to waste in their homes and stuff.
[3:13:39.700 --> 3:13:43.700]  And all this falls down to is the government controlling our food.
[3:13:43.700 --> 3:13:48.700]  They're, they're, they're all of this is about bankrupting the regular economy.
[3:13:48.700 --> 3:13:52.700]  It's exactly, they're buying the system out from owners.
[3:13:52.700 --> 3:13:55.700]  They're working people cannot even get a gallon of milk.
[3:13:55.700 --> 3:13:57.700]  Brother, I agree with you.
[3:13:57.700 --> 3:13:59.700]  So what do we do?
[3:13:59.700 --> 3:14:03.700]  Because listen, I like Trump, but I'm not an idiot.
[3:14:03.700 --> 3:14:06.700]  And Trump's going along with this.
[3:14:06.700 --> 3:14:08.700]  So what do we do about Trump?
[3:14:08.700 --> 3:14:11.700]  I was so upset to hear him say what he said.
[3:14:11.700 --> 3:14:12.700]  I mean, it broke my heart.
[3:14:12.700 --> 3:14:17.700]  I wear, I am such a Trump supporter, but I am so mad at him right now.
[3:14:17.700 --> 3:14:20.700]  I don't know what to do out.
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:23.700]  It is so frustrating.
[3:14:23.700 --> 3:14:31.700]  And sometimes I wonder if he didn't just give in to the system, sell out.
[3:14:31.700 --> 3:14:34.700]  I don't know what's going on, brother, but I know this.
[3:14:34.700 --> 3:14:37.700]  You're not selling out Scotty and neither am I.
[3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:39.700]  I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[3:14:39.700 --> 3:14:41.700]  At this point, I appreciate you, Scotty.
[3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:46.700]  We'll come back with Austin and Steven appear next segment.
[3:14:46.700 --> 3:14:49.700]  This is insane.
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:52.700]  What's going on is completely insane.
[3:14:52.700 --> 3:14:59.700]  And at a certain point, I don't even know what to do anymore because.
[3:14:59.700 --> 3:15:07.700]  You have all these bureaucrats coming out, trying to say America's done and Trump sucks and I get all that.
[3:15:07.700 --> 3:15:13.700]  And then I know why Trump tries to come out then and take control of it by saying, you know, oh, I'll just have the military.
[3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:18.700]  And inoculations, I get what Trump's doing.
[3:15:18.700 --> 3:15:29.700]  But I don't get what he's doing because the best thing to do would just be expose Fauci and expose the Clintons and expose their whole nine yards, but.
[3:15:29.700 --> 3:15:35.700]  See what happens.
[3:15:35.700 --> 3:15:39.700]  I know this.
[3:15:39.700 --> 3:15:40.700]  Look at Fauci.
[3:15:40.700 --> 3:15:42.700]  I mean, what a disgusting person.
[3:15:42.700 --> 3:15:49.700]  I was watching him in that press conference today with a mask on and just every fiber of my body was like, that's an enemy.
[3:15:49.700 --> 3:15:51.700]  And we all know this.
[3:15:51.700 --> 3:15:52.700]  Our instincts are never wrong.
[3:15:52.700 --> 3:15:56.700]  I mean, I'm looking at that guy going, man, that is my God almighty.
[3:15:56.700 --> 3:15:57.700]  That's my enemy.
[3:15:57.700 --> 3:15:59.700]  Damn, I hate that person.
[3:15:59.700 --> 3:16:00.700]  God almighty.
[3:16:00.700 --> 3:16:02.700]  I hate that son of a bitch.
[3:16:02.700 --> 3:16:04.700]  I mean, I'm just being honest with you.
[3:16:04.700 --> 3:16:07.700]  That piece of filth and he was involved in HIV scam.
[3:16:07.700 --> 3:16:12.700]  He was involved, he was involved, he's involved in everything.
[3:16:12.700 --> 3:16:14.700]  And it comes down to a point of weave.
[3:16:14.700 --> 3:16:15.700]  Look at that little demon.
[3:16:15.700 --> 3:16:18.700]  Look at that stack of bills.
[3:16:18.700 --> 3:16:23.700]  I just hope Jesus Christ breaks his neck.
[3:16:23.700 --> 3:16:26.700]  I'm not going to try to hurt Fauci, but I just pray to Jesus.
[3:16:26.700 --> 3:16:33.700]  If Fauci deserves it, Lord Jesus, I hope Fauci burns in hell.
[3:16:33.700 --> 3:16:38.700]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[3:16:38.700 --> 3:16:44.700]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off and they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[3:16:44.700 --> 3:16:46.700]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[3:16:46.700 --> 3:16:48.700]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[3:16:48.700 --> 3:16:50.700]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[3:16:50.700 --> 3:16:52.700]  You are non-essential.
[3:16:52.700 --> 3:16:54.700]  We are shutting your ass down.
[3:16:54.700 --> 3:16:59.700]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[3:16:59.700 --> 3:17:00.700]  You're going to be the service economy.
[3:17:00.700 --> 3:17:05.700]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[3:17:05.700 --> 3:17:11.700]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:14.700]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[3:17:14.700 --> 3:17:17.700]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order.
[3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:25.700]  And that takes you understanding you were right and understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[3:17:25.700 --> 3:17:27.700]  Now is the time for action.
[3:17:27.700 --> 3:17:32.700]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[3:17:57.700 --> 3:18:12.700]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[3:18:12.700 --> 3:18:24.700]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[3:18:24.700 --> 3:18:30.700]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the info store. Never been a better time than right now.
[3:18:30.700 --> 3:18:55.700]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020 within a week or so. Many of the best selling items that we're selling them for store.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[3:18:55.700 --> 3:19:04.700]  I want you to get vasovetes. I want you to get DNA force plus. I want you to experience X2. I want you to get real red pill and real red pill plus.
[3:19:04.700 --> 3:19:13.700]  They're all in stock right now and they're 30 to 60% off or the 20 items are 50% off right now.
[3:19:13.700 --> 3:19:22.700]  But we're going to have to end the sale on most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling out like real red pill, real red pill plus and vasovetes.
[3:19:22.700 --> 3:19:37.700]  So take action, be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses and fund the info war. Get in these great products at infostore.com.
[3:19:37.700 --> 3:19:50.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:50.700 --> 3:19:55.700]  I know a lot about history.
[3:19:55.700 --> 3:20:07.700]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:07.700 --> 3:20:22.700]  All right, Peter, Steven Austin for tenure calls right now. Austin in Kansas, you're up front. Go ahead. Welcome. Alex, how's it going, man? Man, I'm watching World Government unfold in front of everybody.
[3:20:22.700 --> 3:20:25.700]  It's just disgusting, quite frankly.
[3:20:25.700 --> 3:20:28.700]  It's pretty sad, I agree.
[3:20:28.700 --> 3:20:40.700]  My brother-in-law is a nurse of anesthesia in Oklahoma and he said the coronavirus is real, which I'm not going to argue with them.
[3:20:40.700 --> 3:20:43.700]  But it's not as serious as they're saying.
[3:20:43.700 --> 3:20:53.700]  And one of the main problems he has with this vaccine they're supposedly coming out with is this virus has like over 30 different mutations.
[3:20:53.700 --> 3:21:05.700]  And if they can't even get the flu vaccine right every year, why do people think that this is going to be a solution to this supposed COVID-19 virus?
[3:21:05.700 --> 3:21:07.700]  Austin, I agree with you.
[3:21:07.700 --> 3:21:21.700]  And so why is Trump? We want Trump to succeed. I love Trump. Why is he coming out saying, oh, we're going to have a good vaccine for you in six months and the Army is going to deliver it?
[3:21:21.700 --> 3:21:29.700]  With that, I do not know. But I know a lot of people who say that President Trump is the best president, and these are people a lot older than I am.
[3:21:29.700 --> 3:21:32.700]  He's the best president in their lifetime.
[3:21:32.700 --> 3:21:36.700]  I know George Washington, in my eyes, is the best president ever.
[3:21:36.700 --> 3:21:41.700]  And what he did is he was one of the people, right? They overthrew the British.
[3:21:41.700 --> 3:21:46.700]  And whenever he established America, when he was done with his reign, he stepped down.
[3:21:46.700 --> 3:21:52.700]  And this is the government buying up the people. I wish President Trump would listen to the American people right now.
[3:21:52.700 --> 3:21:55.700]  It doesn't seem like he's doing that.
[3:21:55.700 --> 3:21:57.700]  I agree with that statement, Austin. Thank you.
[3:21:57.700 --> 3:22:02.700]  Peter in Toronto and Mike and others. Peter, go ahead, sir. Welcome.
[3:22:02.700 --> 3:22:04.700]  How are you doing, Alex?
[3:22:04.700 --> 3:22:06.700]  Good, brother. Go ahead.
[3:22:06.700 --> 3:22:11.700]  Wonderful. So I'm working in Toronto right now at Sunnybrook Hospital.
[3:22:11.700 --> 3:22:19.700]  And so far, a lot of the people there are just suffering from, like, anxiety, you know, because everyone's scared of all the fear mongering.
[3:22:19.700 --> 3:22:22.700]  They're like, oh, coronavirus, coronavirus.
[3:22:22.700 --> 3:22:27.700]  So you're seeing hysterical mental patients. You're not seeing real coronavirus.
[3:22:27.700 --> 3:22:31.700]  No, like, no way. Like, a lot of these people are just scared.
[3:22:31.700 --> 3:22:37.700]  They're scared about the propaganda that these people are putting on the air. It's disgusting.
[3:22:37.700 --> 3:22:43.700]  Like, the people that come in, they're all just worried, sick. They all have face masks and gloves and all this stuff.
[3:22:43.700 --> 3:22:49.700]  But a majority of my hospital is empty. It is absolutely ridiculous.
[3:22:49.700 --> 3:22:54.700]  Like, I've been listening to you for a while. You have shown me the Federal Reserve.
[3:22:54.700 --> 3:23:06.700]  And when I found out about the gold standard and all that stuff and how, let's be honest, okay, the Jews just print money and they print it out of thin air and they redistribute it back to us at interest.
[3:23:06.700 --> 3:23:13.700]  And when you put me on that, that changed my life. And ever since I've been working at this hospital, I've been telling all the nurses and stuff.
[3:23:13.700 --> 3:23:19.700]  Like, listen, guys, coronavirus is not real. It's all in our minds. It's all in our heads.
[3:23:19.700 --> 3:23:26.700]  It's making us believe that something is real. Therefore, it must be because of the fact that everyone else collectively agrees on that.
[3:23:26.700 --> 3:23:28.700]  And that's the problem right there.
[3:23:28.700 --> 3:23:40.700]  But at the end of the day, what I see right now is that this is a nonsense. All of this is nonsense fueled by propaganda and the mainstream media telling everyone to believe it.
[3:23:40.700 --> 3:23:50.700]  It's ridiculous. And at this point in time, these people who are publishing this stuff, they should be charged with treason at this point.
[3:23:50.700 --> 3:23:54.700]  But that's just what I believe, personally. I'm not sure if you will, Alex, but...
[3:23:54.700 --> 3:24:02.700]  Well, Peter, I don't try to make it about Russians or Jews or Americans or whatever, but yeah, there are big central banks that create fiat currency.
[3:24:02.700 --> 3:24:07.700]  They want to get us deeper into debt. And there's no doubt there's a big banking takeover happening right now.
[3:24:07.700 --> 3:24:13.700]  And there's no doubt the ADL is supposedly Jewish running it. It's anti-American and anti-free speech is really a dangerous group.
[3:24:13.700 --> 3:24:17.700]  But there's all sorts of the Chai comms and other groups that are involved.
[3:24:17.700 --> 3:24:22.700]  So I'm not defending some of the leftist Jewish groups through anti-free speech. In fact, I'm against them.
[3:24:22.700 --> 3:24:27.700]  But there are just other authoritarian groups out there as well. So I just make it about authoritarianism.
[3:24:27.700 --> 3:24:30.700]  We should block it at every front. Peter, I appreciate your call.
[3:24:30.700 --> 3:24:37.700]  But yeah, that's really what's going on right now. And we're seeing the full brunt of tyranny right now.
[3:24:37.700 --> 3:24:46.700]  So I don't care if you're white or you're black or you're Christian or you're Muslim or you're Jewish or you're agnostic or you're an atheist.
[3:24:46.700 --> 3:24:54.700]  I don't want to see worldwide shutdown based on fraud. I don't want to see martial law.
[3:24:54.700 --> 3:25:02.700]  I don't want to see mass death. And I don't care if you're Jewish or you're Japanese or you're Russian.
[3:25:02.700 --> 3:25:06.700]  If you want freedom and a good free market in the future, then I'm for you.
[3:25:06.700 --> 3:25:11.700]  But if you're for this Luciferian New World Order, why don't care what color you are?
[3:25:11.700 --> 3:25:16.700]  Because they got devil worshipers that are black, that are white, that are polka dotted. They're all our enemy.
[3:25:16.700 --> 3:25:23.700]  All right, Mike in Massachusetts, you're on the air. Go ahead, daughters of nurse. Tell us what you're seeing.
[3:25:23.700 --> 3:25:27.700]  How's it going, Alex? Big fan of the show. Great show today.
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:36.700]  My daughter's a ICU nurse up at the local hospital. She was laid off because of the low capacity of this.
[3:25:36.700 --> 3:25:43.700]  Now, if you drive by any local hospital around my area, they have the tents outside. They have all that stuff up and they are empty.
[3:25:43.700 --> 3:25:49.700]  Just like I've seen on your show, just like they've shown or haven't shown, I should say, but they are empty.
[3:25:49.700 --> 3:25:55.700]  And my big concern is that they're going to try to force this virus vaccine.
[3:25:55.700 --> 3:26:01.700]  Now, what would you recommend if that comes down and they try to force this on everybody?
[3:26:01.700 --> 3:26:06.700]  Well, they're going to try to say, if you want your job or you want to fly on a plane, you got to have it.
[3:26:06.700 --> 3:26:11.700]  And I told my wife, she agreed with me. We had this talk last night. She said, no, I'm not doing this.
[3:26:11.700 --> 3:26:19.700]  So we got to follow lawsuits. We got to get it. What is taking some vaccine mean? We're safe to fly when it doesn't even guess the right mutation.
[3:26:19.700 --> 3:26:29.700]  It's total fraud, but it's not just about the vaccine. It's about them tracking you digitally, medically to say you've had what they want to put in your body to be able to travel.
[3:26:29.700 --> 3:26:31.700]  How evil is that?
[3:26:31.700 --> 3:26:35.700]  Very evil. If they keep up, I'll make it quick. I mean, I know you got other people talking.
[3:26:35.700 --> 3:26:38.700]  No, I got time, brother. Go ahead, Mike. We got three minutes break.
[3:26:38.700 --> 3:26:42.700]  Right. You keep up the good work, man. I watch it daily, you know, by the products.
[3:26:42.700 --> 3:26:48.700]  And like I said, our biggest concern out here on the East Coast, I mean, I wish we could get out of here soon if it's going to continue like this.
[3:26:48.700 --> 3:26:53.700]  But I don't know if this is getting crazy up on my end of the world up here.
[3:26:53.700 --> 3:26:55.700]  God bless you, Mike.
[3:26:55.700 --> 3:27:02.700]  You know, it's just as bad in the South. It's just as bad in the West. It's all just brainwashing and the average person's a good person.
[3:27:02.700 --> 3:27:08.700]  And these people calling, they go, Jones, what do I do? I'm having these same thoughts. What do I do?
[3:27:08.700 --> 3:27:16.700]  I'm not like here. Like I'm on some high horse and I have all the answers.
[3:27:16.700 --> 3:27:22.700]  They're exacerbating the crisis. They're saying that everybody's dying of this thing that aren't.
[3:27:22.700 --> 3:27:26.700]  They're taking every old person that dies of something else to put in the column.
[3:27:26.700 --> 3:27:31.700]  It is a United Nations global government takeover.
[3:27:31.700 --> 3:27:36.700]  And I don't want to be at the grocery store.
[3:27:36.700 --> 3:27:41.700]  When some old lady walks over and goes, you're not wearing your mask. I don't want to get in her face, but I do.
[3:27:41.700 --> 3:27:48.700]  And I go, hey, ma'am, I'm not against you, but you know that statistically this didn't kill as many as a flu.
[3:27:48.700 --> 3:27:55.700]  You know they're counting all deaths. Oh, shut up. Oh, you don't want to be safe. And I'm like, listen,
[3:27:55.700 --> 3:28:01.700]  you understand all the major economies are shutting down. You understand this is a good. I don't want to hear it.
[3:28:01.700 --> 3:28:08.700]  I'm just because to them it's easy. They wear a mask. They're good. And I get that. You got to think about the average person.
[3:28:08.700 --> 3:28:14.700]  They just go, hey, I can ply. I'm a good person.
[3:28:14.700 --> 3:28:20.700]  And so don't get mad at them, but explain it to them.
[3:28:20.700 --> 3:28:26.700]  And I've had about half people I talked to actually go, really, you'll take the mask off and they'll go, tell me.
[3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:30.700]  And I start telling them they listen.
[3:28:30.700 --> 3:28:39.700]  So there's a lot of hope there in that if you have your talking points correctly and you talk to somebody, you can do it.
[3:28:39.700 --> 3:28:44.700]  And by the way, folks, I don't have some big swing in Johnson to, like, try to get in people's face.
[3:28:44.700 --> 3:28:49.700]  I don't want to be at the grocery store on the hiking bike trail against my space. I got to do it.
[3:28:49.700 --> 3:28:54.700]  So my kids are with me. They're like, dad, please. Some old lady starts arguing with me.
[3:28:54.700 --> 3:28:59.700]  My kids are like, dad, just, and I'm like, hey, this is not how the world works.
[3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:06.700]  The fact that we don't communicate with each other has created this climate where this line can work.
[3:29:06.700 --> 3:29:09.700]  I'm going to tell these people what's going on.
[3:29:09.700 --> 3:29:14.700]  And then, you know, sometimes every once in a while, some big dude, like, I'm going to beat your ass.
[3:29:14.700 --> 3:29:19.700]  And right at the moment from their wife, you're like, let's go. It's not that tough.
[3:29:19.700 --> 3:29:26.700]  They back down. I'm like, yeah, exactly. This is not about putting on a front here. This is about reality.
[3:29:26.700 --> 3:29:29.700]  So yeah, I mean, I've almost got to get physical fights down about this.
[3:29:29.700 --> 3:29:31.700]  I'm willing to do it if I have to.
[3:29:31.700 --> 3:29:33.700]  There was.
[3:29:33.700 --> 3:29:40.700]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[3:29:40.700 --> 3:29:47.700]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes up.
[3:29:47.700 --> 3:29:54.700]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:54.700 --> 3:29:56.700]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[3:29:56.700 --> 3:30:06.700]  DNA Force Plus. It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known to supercharge the effects of that.
[3:30:06.700 --> 3:30:14.700]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are, no matter where you live in the world.
[3:30:14.700 --> 3:30:16.700]  It works the same on everybody.
[3:30:16.700 --> 3:30:19.700]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[3:30:19.700 --> 3:30:22.700]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[3:30:22.700 --> 3:30:27.700]  It doesn't make them grow, make them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[3:30:27.700 --> 3:30:34.700]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:34.700 --> 3:30:37.700]  The United States is not communist China.
[3:30:37.700 --> 3:30:40.700]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[3:30:40.700 --> 3:30:42.700]  We don't blow up churches.
[3:30:42.700 --> 3:30:45.700]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[3:30:45.700 --> 3:30:54.700]  But all over the news, we see the UN, billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media, praising communist China for their response.
[3:30:54.700 --> 3:31:02.700]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then gee, we've got to do that.
[3:31:02.700 --> 3:31:07.700]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[3:31:07.700 --> 3:31:10.700]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[3:31:10.700 --> 3:31:15.700]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time
[3:31:15.700 --> 3:31:21.700]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their power grab.
[3:31:21.700 --> 3:31:25.700]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowarstore.com.
[3:31:25.700 --> 3:31:40.700]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things.
[3:31:40.700 --> 3:31:44.700]  But you notice almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[3:31:44.700 --> 3:31:48.700]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[3:31:48.700 --> 3:31:55.700]  It's like telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[3:31:55.700 --> 3:31:58.700]  People don't listen, they go out and their kids dead in the pool.
[3:31:58.700 --> 3:32:02.700]  Well ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[3:32:02.700 --> 3:32:09.700]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists and they admit they've orchestrated it.
[3:32:09.700 --> 3:32:15.700]  They admit it's good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor
[3:32:15.700 --> 3:32:19.700]  because they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[3:32:19.700 --> 3:32:27.700]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[3:32:27.700 --> 3:32:34.700]  I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[3:32:34.700 --> 3:32:39.700]  Vitamin mineral fusion is one of our best-selling products. It wasn't always that way.
[3:32:39.700 --> 3:32:47.700]  We hardly ever promoted it. We first launched it a few years ago, but people slowly began to try it and almost everyone that orders it reorders it.
[3:32:47.700 --> 3:32:55.700]  That's why we're offering it right now at infowarslife.com at 50% off, even though we're about to sell out.
[3:32:55.700 --> 3:33:01.700]  Because I want people who've been on the fence, who've heard us talk about it, who've read some of the reviews to experience it for yourself.
[3:33:01.700 --> 3:33:05.700]  And this is important. It's not just all the key vitamins and minerals you need.
[3:33:05.700 --> 3:33:10.700]  We've got amino acids that are known to help you absorb more of this into your body.
[3:33:10.700 --> 3:33:19.700]  And that's really important for folks that are older because a lot of people don't absorb vitamins and minerals in pill form or caplet form,
[3:33:19.700 --> 3:33:22.700]  but they get a higher absorption rate when it's liquid.
[3:33:22.700 --> 3:33:28.700]  So this powdered formula goes great into water, into other juices. It's good for adults. It's good for children.
[3:33:28.700 --> 3:33:37.700]  Any advantage of this super sale that's about to end at infowarslife.com today with vitamin mineral fusion.
[3:33:37.700 --> 3:33:45.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:45.700 --> 3:33:59.700]  Our final segment for Owen Troyer and the war on takeover. And you know, here's the deal.
[3:33:59.700 --> 3:34:07.700]  It's kind of emblematic that the TV screens failed. Some computer broke today, so there's no background because without infowars, this is what it'll look like.
[3:34:07.700 --> 3:34:21.700]  You know, I'm sitting here as a man who never sold out to the dark side, but I still ask myself, did you do everything you could to oppose it?
[3:34:21.700 --> 3:34:27.700]  No, probably not. I did.
[3:34:27.700 --> 3:34:30.700]  That's between me and God.
[3:34:30.700 --> 3:34:39.700]  But I'll tell you this, I sure as hell didn't run around like some clown, getting off on all this evil BS, all this devil worship.
[3:34:39.700 --> 3:34:47.700]  And I look at the people that happily sold out to this and I don't see them as my enemies. I see them as losers.
[3:34:47.700 --> 3:34:55.700]  I see them as people getting pulled down to a black hole, have no idea what they're involved in.
[3:34:55.700 --> 3:35:01.700]  So I'll just leave it at this. I am humbled by the colors we have. I'm humbled by the crew we have.
[3:35:01.700 --> 3:35:06.700]  I am humbled by my life and the things we've had that we've done together that is successful.
[3:35:06.700 --> 3:35:19.700]  But I tell you, the games are over, folks. Party's over. All you people that think we're going to kill.
[3:35:19.700 --> 3:35:31.700]  All those children. I shake it fear for my children. What we've done to these children.
[3:35:31.700 --> 3:35:37.700]  And that's the sick part of it. The truth is, I hope God blows the whole planet up.
[3:35:37.700 --> 3:35:53.700]  Seriously, you think I'm scared of the new world order. I'm scared of God. We're that close to God hitting one button and the whole thing blows up because we deserve it.
[3:35:53.700 --> 3:36:02.700]  We've been such damn cowards. We put up with so much evil and we don't deserve anything.
[3:36:02.700 --> 3:36:08.700]  And that's why there's grace. God's grace is all that matters.
[3:36:08.700 --> 3:36:16.700]  And I'm counting on God's grace for my four children, my son and my three daughters are amazing people and they're not evil.
[3:36:16.700 --> 3:36:23.700]  And they deserve a future. And so I'm betting everything on grace right now.
[3:36:23.700 --> 3:36:27.700]  But I look at these devil worshipers that don't even have any connection to God.
[3:36:27.700 --> 3:36:40.700]  Yeah, like those people right there. They think it's funny what they're doing.
[3:36:40.700 --> 3:36:43.700]  So we just got to make sure we're not with them. Let's take a few calls here.
[3:36:43.700 --> 3:36:50.700]  Michael in Canada, other than James in Louisiana, we'll edit there. Go ahead, Michael. Thanks for holding.
[3:36:50.700 --> 3:36:51.700]  Hello.
[3:36:51.700 --> 3:36:53.700]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[3:36:53.700 --> 3:37:02.700]  Hi, Alex. I work as a doctor in Toronto. Hey, question. What do you think about John McAfee making his own private coin to combat the global.
[3:37:02.700 --> 3:37:08.700]  I heard like five calls today on air. What's it called ghost currency or something?
[3:37:08.700 --> 3:37:10.700]  Oh, man, it's awesome.
[3:37:10.700 --> 3:37:17.700]  No, I don't know about it. I know McAfee. I love McAfee. He wouldn't come on for like two years. I want to give him.
[3:37:17.700 --> 3:37:20.700]  I don't know. Tell me what he's doing. I'm not aware of it.
[3:37:20.700 --> 3:37:25.700]  Okay. What he's doing is he's making his own cryptocurrency, which is private and untraceable.
[3:37:25.700 --> 3:37:32.700]  It's to combat the global elite who have been enslaving us all for thousands of years.
[3:37:32.700 --> 3:37:33.700]  And it will free.
[3:37:33.700 --> 3:37:39.700]  Well, I'm all for new free systems. We should get McAfee on. But I've had like five calls today about a site guys.
[3:37:39.700 --> 3:37:41.700]  What's he doing? This thing must be hotter than hell.
[3:37:41.700 --> 3:37:46.700]  If like out of the phones up and like five callers about this, what's going on?
[3:37:46.700 --> 3:37:52.700]  Yeah, man, it is absolutely amazing. You have to check out ghost. It will change the world as we know it.
[3:37:52.700 --> 3:37:56.700]  And McAfee is 74 years old. He's only living once.
[3:37:56.700 --> 3:38:02.700]  And might as well enjoy it and live with the legacy of forever knowing that we will be free.
[3:38:02.700 --> 3:38:11.700]  Okay. So how is because I'm not and I'm not being patronizing. I'm saying how is ghost different? What is ghost do?
[3:38:11.700 --> 3:38:19.700]  It's essentially a cryptocurrency that uses a proof of stake system. So essentially a lot of people lock up their coins and they earn an interest rate on it.
[3:38:19.700 --> 3:38:25.700]  That's pretty much what it is. But more to the point is the fact that it's untraceable and it's private.
[3:38:25.700 --> 3:38:36.700]  So for anybody out there that doesn't like the federal reserve system and fiat currency system that we have right now, I would advise that you guys check out ghost.
[3:38:36.700 --> 3:38:37.700]  It will change your life.
[3:38:37.700 --> 3:38:44.700]  What do you make of Trump talking about the army inoculating people? That sounds like a declaration of war.
[3:38:44.700 --> 3:38:52.700]  Personally, I always thought that Trump is work is Q and I think that he's going to be doing big things.
[3:38:52.700 --> 3:38:55.700]  But that's just me. That's what I believe.
[3:38:55.700 --> 3:39:02.700]  But of course, we have counterintelligence of you saying that Trump potentially might be with the deep state.
[3:39:02.700 --> 3:39:07.700]  But then I have counterintelligence that Trump is actually working against the deep state. So it's all.
[3:39:07.700 --> 3:39:13.700]  No, no, no, no, no, no. I think Trump's working as a deep state.
[3:39:13.700 --> 3:39:14.700]  You think so?
[3:39:14.700 --> 3:39:19.700]  Yeah. But this.
[3:39:19.700 --> 3:39:26.700]  But you can't promote inoculations. They don't work anyways. Listen, I'm a technology guy.
[3:39:26.700 --> 3:39:39.700]  Like I drink a glass of water. I get hydrated. Vaccines don't work, bro.
[3:39:39.700 --> 3:39:42.700]  All I see is that the world is changing really quickly.
[3:39:42.700 --> 3:39:45.700]  Yeah, it's changing really quickly. Exactly. God bless.
[3:39:45.700 --> 3:39:50.700]  All right. James Louisiana, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[3:39:50.700 --> 3:39:59.700]  Hey, Jones, how you doing? Real quick, I want to mirror with a lot of the other people have said my wife works in a CCU ICU context.
[3:39:59.700 --> 3:40:06.700]  And she was being repeatedly canceled. They are not. They're definitely not overrun.
[3:40:06.700 --> 3:40:11.700]  And there's not piles of body bags and millions dead.
[3:40:11.700 --> 3:40:25.700]  No, certainly not the case. My best friend is a ER doctor. And before we had discussions about certain idiosyncratic, you know, unusual findings and people's blood markers and stuff.
[3:40:25.700 --> 3:40:35.700]  I was skeptical of the whole thing is just a complete hoax to house Trump and take the economy way that's told us right before this, you know, happy.
[3:40:35.700 --> 3:40:39.700]  Exactly. So why is Trump suddenly going along with it? I mean,
[3:40:39.700 --> 3:40:50.700]  you know, I don't I won't say that I have a confident answer on that except the whole time with the 3D chess is Trump good, bad thing.
[3:40:50.700 --> 3:40:59.700]  There's a lot of pitfalls with either way you go, you know, the Trump card is not owned by any suit, but is playable by all.
[3:40:59.700 --> 3:41:03.700]  And that's a metaphor. And, you know, Trump's name is not a concept.
[3:41:03.700 --> 3:41:13.700]  No, but they're definitely don't like him. So he could, well, he did just stop the censorship. He needs to like, you know, at a certain point, it's like, what?
[3:41:13.700 --> 3:41:22.700]  Now you're going to try to make me inoculate the fly a damn airplane. And they admit it wanting Fauci says it won't protect me.
[3:41:22.700 --> 3:41:27.700]  And then Trump's like, oh, we got the army ready for it. I got the army ready for you, buddy.
[3:41:27.700 --> 3:41:36.700]  Yeah, I heard David Knight expressing some some bold frustrations earlier today about Trump and regard this.
[3:41:36.700 --> 3:41:44.700]  And the problem is, let's say he's not with him, and he's doing the 3D thing where he says let's take it from the NIH and Fauci.
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:55.700]  The, you know, what do you think is going to happen if he's already setting it up for the military to be going door to door and something happens where like say Pelosi ends up in charge.
[3:41:55.700 --> 3:42:02.700]  Exactly. You just hit the key. You can't legitimize it. Like, like, look, look, look, look, Trump.
[3:42:02.700 --> 3:42:10.700]  And this is about me bragging. Listen, you know, Trump had two NRA board members call me and they go, listen, back when Trump still cared like a year and a half ago, he goes,
[3:42:10.700 --> 3:42:15.700]  Don't worry, we're not for gun control. We're going to get them to admit they're for gun control by doing this.
[3:42:15.700 --> 3:42:21.700]  And I was like, and I saw it happen at work. I didn't get the call this time.
[3:42:21.700 --> 3:42:27.700]  Now it's forth. I guess I'm supposed to just figure this out. But now it's like forced inoculation.
[3:42:27.700 --> 3:42:35.700]  And then Trump's just sitting over there and I'm just like, I hear you, brother. I appreciate anything else, James.
[3:42:35.700 --> 3:42:42.700]  Yeah, I was just going to say, when it comes to people who espouse the dialectic, the Hegelian contradicts review of philosophy.
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:55.700]  When someone talks out of both sides of their mouth, a rational person stopped listening, right? They're not going to sit here and wonder if your intentional states correspond to what you're saying when they've seen you say two different things repeatedly.
[3:42:55.700 --> 3:43:03.700]  So the danger of this 3D chess is that you turn your people who did trust you into those who don't even listen.
[3:43:03.700 --> 3:43:12.700]  Well, exactly. You can't put out messages because it has a power. You say vaccines are legitimate. It has a power.
[3:43:12.700 --> 3:43:24.700]  Correct. You know, it's why integration is a skill. And, you know, I think that reasons the way forward, if I could just say, you know, I'm a former minister, so I know eschatology better than most people.
[3:43:24.700 --> 3:43:34.700]  And I understand why people who are Christians are nervous. You know, I do remember the book, 88 Reasons Why Jesus Is Coming Back in 1988.
[3:43:34.700 --> 3:43:43.700]  And, you know, every time something in the newspaper happens that looks similar to the eschatological predictions, people get stressed out.
[3:43:43.700 --> 3:43:49.700]  And one of the things, like your callers already said, people are high strung. I see you. You're, you know, you're concerned.
[3:43:49.700 --> 3:43:59.700]  And you should be concerned because bad things are happening. And I don't know if the so-called globalists are trolling religious people or if people are self-fulfilling prophecies.
[3:43:59.700 --> 3:44:12.700]  But I would like to say to everybody, including Christians and including, you know, bizarrely, Satanists or Luciferians, you know, what can you be the person who says to themselves, what kind of future do I want to live in?
[3:44:12.700 --> 3:44:22.700]  Well, I agree. Well, that's it. And here's the thing. Bible prophecy is being fulfilled right now. Is there some sub-level? Maybe. This is the, this is happening.
[3:44:43.700 --> 3:44:56.700]  Well, now this is available in the United States. It's proprietary. It has rave reviews. It's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become a best seller.
[3:44:56.700 --> 3:45:05.700]  We're very close to selling out pollen block right now. It'll take eight weeks to get more in. But despite that, I'm going to sell it at 50% off until it sells out.
[3:45:05.700 --> 3:45:17.700]  So for those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence and have seasonal discomfort, experience pollen block for yourself right now at m4warstore.com for 50% off pollen block.
[3:45:17.700 --> 3:45:36.700]  I want people that haven't tried it to try it for themselves. So it's the lowest price ever, even though it's selling out.
