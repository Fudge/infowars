[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:23.040]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.040 --> 00:28.960]  all right absolutely vital transmission that we just kicked off it is
[00:28.960 --> 00:33.840]  Thursday the 13th day of January 2011
[00:33.840 --> 00:39.120]  art dice is going to be joining us coming up in the third hour he was a
[00:39.120 --> 00:46.200]  big part of the decoded on the history channel a very highly rated show dealing
[00:46.200 --> 00:50.240]  with the Statue of Liberty and the Illuminati the Statue of Liberty of
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.480]  course does represent Lucifer and by the end of the show they admit that but
[00:54.480 --> 01:01.280]  say it's the good Lucifer and because I am in an upcoming Bohemian Grove episode
[01:01.280 --> 01:09.440]  airing what the 27th of this month I can now reveal a little bit more about the
[01:09.440 --> 01:14.920]  show today I'm an astronaut talk about it till it airs but I can talk about some
[01:14.920 --> 01:27.000]  of it we did go back to Bohemian Grove and the folks got arrested I escaped but
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.200]  I'm gonna leave it at that mark dice is joining us coming up in the third hour
[01:34.200 --> 01:42.000]  today I was not about to go to jail and I quite frankly really hadn't even
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.400]  infiltrated the Grove that was all part of the bizarre spin of it is that we
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.760]  were well I'm not gonna talk about it it's all in the upcoming show I'll talk
[01:49.760 --> 01:55.480]  about a little bit of it coming up in the third hour and now Brad Metzler the
[01:55.480 --> 02:00.600]  best-selling author and the host of the show gave an NPR interview a New York
[02:00.600 --> 02:04.360]  Daily News interview and admitted that he secretly has done work for the
[02:04.360 --> 02:11.600]  government big surprise the crew was nice when I was out there with them but
[02:11.600 --> 02:20.960]  Aaron's going wire these people wearing CIA hats and CIA jackets and I said well
[02:20.960 --> 02:28.280]  don't worry Aaron the real CIA wouldn't be wearing all of this stuff in plain
[02:28.280 --> 02:37.800]  view unless they were hiding in plain view but I'll get into mark dice's take
[02:37.800 --> 02:42.480]  on all of this I think it's a good show very well produced a very slick very
[02:42.480 --> 02:48.440]  interesting we'll talk to mark dice about that coming up in the third hour
[02:48.440 --> 02:54.200]  today and we'll open the phones up on that subject obviously in the first two
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.640]  hours we're gonna get into the economic news jobless claims jump wholesale food
[02:59.640 --> 03:05.520]  cost surge wholesale food prices were going up two years ago at the wholesale
[03:05.520 --> 03:10.320]  level they accelerated the last year as one of our sponsors told you on air
[03:10.320 --> 03:15.600]  about how his wholesale prices were really going up but that he was holding
[03:15.600 --> 03:19.600]  prices and now it started really hit store shelves and it's all part of
[03:19.600 --> 03:22.640]  inflation when you read these news articles the mainstream media that they
[03:22.640 --> 03:26.840]  never tell you why it's happening they always claim a drought here a fire there
[03:26.840 --> 03:32.000]  those are all small contributors and overall they add to the sum but the
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.400]  biggest part of the equation is dollar and currency devaluation we're gonna be
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.920]  going over that more on Obama administration developing internet ID
[03:42.920 --> 03:49.320]  program exactly what that's gonna mean for society big pushback against

[08:45.760 --> 08:50.160]  and what's happening in our society as people discover more and more
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.000]  that we have a world government run by private corporations
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.880]  attempting to expand their power and control he'll be joining us
[08:56.880 --> 09:04.560]  in the third hour today I want to open the phones up specifically
[09:04.560 --> 09:08.880]  and we don't screen your calls and normally it's a free-for-all but
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.280]  sometimes I say maybe once a week or so I want to hear from listeners
[09:13.280 --> 09:22.080]  specifically on an issue and I watched the
[09:22.080 --> 09:28.400]  speech that Obama gave I watched the head of the university speak
[09:28.400 --> 09:33.920]  I watched the throng of thousands and thousands of people
[09:33.920 --> 09:39.040]  cheering and celebrating and smiling like they were at a football game like
[09:39.040 --> 09:43.360]  they were at a bonfire cookout or something
[09:43.360 --> 09:50.400]  and I watched the vitriol of the head of the university smiling he seemed
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.360]  really happy I witnessed the professionally made
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.840]  14 000 t-shirts that were reportedly made in two days
[10:01.840 --> 10:05.360]  they announced just on tuesday that they would have this particular
[10:05.360 --> 10:09.280]  memorial service that president obama was going to be coming in
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.280]  and we now have seen the rollout of the slogan
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.840]  it's being beta tested now the new slogan for the next presidential election
[10:17.840 --> 10:21.520]  that kicks off in only about six months officially
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.280]  we're going into the 2012 election right now we're now in
[10:25.280 --> 10:32.960]  2011 going into the 2012 election and we now know
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.600]  together we thrive it's all about togetherness
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.880]  in the corporate new world order collectivist
[10:40.880 --> 10:47.120]  borg hive there was the message of togetherness you can feel good michelle
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.520]  can hold the hand of the distraught astronaut
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.480]  husband and she can cry like opera in front of everyone
[10:56.480 --> 10:59.360]  it's the only way obama can get you to tune into his press conference
[10:59.360 --> 11:01.440]  only way he can get you to pay attention to him
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.320]  only way he can hopefully boost his approval ratings
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.000]  is by being our daddy being our savior being our
[11:08.000 --> 11:11.760]  comforter during a domestic terror attack
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.240]  as his white house advisors said over and over again in the last year
[11:16.240 --> 11:20.320]  as we built towards this and whether this was a staged
[11:20.320 --> 11:23.360]  mind control shooting which the evidence all points toward
[11:23.360 --> 11:26.640]  in which we know that their government programs to carry out
[11:26.640 --> 11:30.160]  or whether he was just a drugged out paranoid schizophrenic
[11:30.160 --> 11:33.840]  who they went to his house at least three times their sealed sheriff's
[11:33.840 --> 11:37.520]  department reports about him turns out they knew all about the death threats
[11:37.520 --> 11:40.720]  and did nothing so instead of blaming themselves for not
[11:40.720 --> 11:44.400]  doing their duty they're blaming the general public
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.680]  they're blaming free speech they're blaming the second amendment the right
[11:47.680 --> 11:51.280]  to keep bare arms so they're blaming everything that makes
[11:51.280 --> 11:56.000]  this country so special they're blaming the first
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.480]  and second amendment that's what they're going
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.880]  after in this equation and we see this over
[12:04.880 --> 12:10.000]  and over and over again that every chance the establishment gets
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.040]  every time they get any type of opportunity
[12:15.040 --> 12:20.400]  the system comes after our liberties and so there was a dual message
[12:20.400 --> 12:24.320]  within the overall message of
[12:24.960 --> 12:33.280]  by coming together we strive by unifying we strive together
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.360]  we have prosperity that's the message that's the slogan in fact i'll put the
[12:39.360 --> 12:43.360]  image of the t-shirts that were draped over every
[12:43.360 --> 12:48.160]  chair 14 000 t-shirts draped over for those that attended
[12:48.160 --> 12:53.200]  to put on their uniform of togetherness
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.640]  but that means togetherness under the banner of the establishment
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.760]  together we thrive together we strive these are the things that they said
[13:03.760 --> 13:07.360]  in the speeches it was all choreographed all scripted
[13:07.360 --> 13:13.600]  together we thrive bringing america together and then
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.960]  what was said in the speech we can do better
[13:16.960 --> 13:21.600]  we can be better we're bad we've done something wrong
[13:21.600 --> 13:30.160]  we need to repent and any good lie any good beguiling or seduction
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.240]  has elements of truth in it everybody deep down knows we should repent as a
[13:34.240 --> 13:39.120]  nation for the illegal wars the torture the abortion
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.080]  the corruption the laziness of the public the corruption of the government
[13:44.080 --> 13:46.960]  everybody deep down knows we're going in the wrong direction and to get our act
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.000]  cleaned up but when they come out and say
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.920]  together we thrive they're saying come together
[13:53.920 --> 14:03.840]  unify under the barak hussein obama agenda and that then we will have
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.760]  prosperity if we turn off our thinking camps if we all put on the same uniform
[14:09.760 --> 14:13.920]  if we all cry while obama speaks and then cheer
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.240]  when the head of the university gets up there like it's a
[14:18.240 --> 14:26.960]  rock concert or a football game then we won't have to be scared anymore then
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.200]  our economy will come back then everything will be okay
[14:31.200 --> 14:35.040]  if we just let the goldman sacks jp morgan chase
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.880]  administration that runs the leadership of both political parties
[14:38.880 --> 14:42.160]  and has an iron grip like no administration ever before
[14:42.160 --> 14:45.760]  on this current white house they're telling us that if you just vote for
[14:45.760 --> 14:48.480]  hope and change you won't have to pay your car payment
[14:48.480 --> 14:51.680]  you won't have to pay for health care you're going to get a job
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.360]  or two years into it did you get any of that
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.840]  no things got worse on every front but they gave you fake
[14:59.840 --> 15:02.800]  government statistics like something out of the old Soviet Union
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.000]  out of pravda to tell you that everything was fine
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.680]  to tell you there was something wrong with you if you didn't like the state
[15:09.680 --> 15:12.400]  of the economy the state of liberty and freedom in this
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.400]  country if you don't like naft and gat that al gore told you was going to be a
[15:16.400 --> 15:22.560]  great deal on larry king live in 1994 if you don't buy his new lies about
[15:22.560 --> 15:26.720]  paying him carbon taxes so he can buy more 15 million dollar homes
[15:26.720 --> 15:31.280]  on the beach that he says is going to be underwater in three years
[15:31.280 --> 15:34.560]  if you don't totally give in to them if you don't totally
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.280]  submit to everything they push well then you're not part of the
[15:39.280 --> 15:44.960]  togetherness where we can strive to work together doing
[15:44.960 --> 15:49.840]  what we're told so that together we will thrive
[15:49.840 --> 15:55.280]  together we thrive i thought america was about individualistically
[15:55.280 --> 15:59.440]  through liberty and through the power of true choice and real diversity
[15:59.440 --> 16:04.480]  that we thrive and that when we choose to work with others and be with others
[16:04.480 --> 16:06.880]  and agree with others that's our choice
[16:06.880 --> 16:12.640]  but they're saying no together we thrive by doing what we're told
[16:12.640 --> 16:16.320]  and not getting angry and not criticizing the death panels
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.080]  and not criticizing abortion and not criticizing torture
[16:20.080 --> 16:25.760]  and not criticizing nine plus year old illegal wars
[16:25.760 --> 16:28.880]  and not criticizing the trillions missing from the benagon
[16:28.880 --> 16:32.400]  and not criticizing the federal reserve and the
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.240]  tens of trillions that are missing bloomberg reports over 28 trillion
[16:36.240 --> 16:39.920]  and we haven't gotten a new number in over a year one year in
[16:39.920 --> 16:46.880]  to the bailout of october 2008 it was 28 missing trillion now
[16:46.880 --> 16:52.080]  a year plus forward we just don't get numbers anymore
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.240]  so the message is sit down shut up don't criticize government
[16:56.240 --> 17:00.080]  or you're going to cause mass shootings and then that is a hoax
[17:00.080 --> 17:04.880]  that is a lie any way you slice it if you believe this guy just organically
[17:04.880 --> 17:07.600]  acted and believe all his neighbors and friends
[17:07.600 --> 17:11.200]  he was smoking a powerful hallucinogen almost every day
[17:11.200 --> 17:14.880]  sometimes multiple times a day that is known for completely scrambling your
[17:14.880 --> 17:18.160]  brain and quote causing disassociative disorders
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.640]  where you don't even know who you are by the way i did some research it was
[17:22.640 --> 17:25.440]  used and tested in CIA mind control programs
[17:25.440 --> 17:29.760]  along with a cocktail of other natural and artificially created pharmacia
[17:29.760 --> 17:33.600]  so you've got a guy running around threatening to kill
[17:33.600 --> 17:36.000]  people in class threatening to kill his neighbors
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.280]  threatening to kill other people sending threatening letters
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.280]  to this congresswoman you've got him obsessing on her putting

[23:06.400 --> 23:09.760]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than
[23:09.760 --> 23:12.400]  silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[23:12.400 --> 23:15.680]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen

[23:56.720 --> 24:12.640]  survivalseedbank.com
[24:17.120 --> 24:20.560]  you know jaren had an idea and i think i'm gonna try to do it today
[24:20.560 --> 24:24.400]  i put it together where i'm gonna shoot a narrative
[24:24.400 --> 24:28.400]  with the hundreds with the hundreds of different groups and people
[24:28.400 --> 24:36.400]  that have been blamed for what the deranged shooter out in tuchon did
[24:36.400 --> 24:41.200]  and they blame the left they blame the right they blame gay people
[24:41.200 --> 24:48.640]  they you know atheist gun owners rush limbaugh alex jones
[24:48.640 --> 24:53.520]  everybody when the truth is he was a guy who did dress up as the grim reaper we
[24:53.520 --> 24:58.480]  now learn that is lofner in the video who was on hardcore
[24:58.480 --> 25:04.480]  psychotropic every single day but there's been some new developments i just
[25:04.480 --> 25:08.400]  heard it during the break limbaugh is reading from all the different
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.680]  mainstream news articles that are out there and this is from his
[25:13.680 --> 25:19.840]  transcript of yesterday jared lofner's friend on gma he didn't listen to
[25:19.840 --> 25:24.240]  political radio and then limbaugh reads over the fact
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.240]  that his friends said that he was into the movie
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.080]  zeitgeist which i'm in the first zeitgeist and the people always get mad at
[25:32.080 --> 25:35.840]  me because they don't agree with zeitgeist political views
[25:35.840 --> 25:41.120]  zeitgeist did not ask me to be in their film they retroactively when they
[25:41.120 --> 25:45.760]  released it theatrically in europe and on dvd
[25:45.760 --> 25:48.880]  asked if they could use it and i said it's already out there with tens of millions
[25:48.880 --> 25:53.280]  seeing it yeah but you know we've had big
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.160]  arguments and debates because the guy that created it is an atheist but but
[25:58.160 --> 26:05.040]  that's a side issue now limbaugh is blaming zeitgeist for it
[26:05.040 --> 26:11.280]  also loose change and it gets worse loose change that i'm a producer on it
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.600]  gets worse you have a trifecta here i'm in zeitgeist i'm of course produced
[26:15.600 --> 26:20.800]  loose change and a scanner darkly 2006 with qiana
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.200]  reeves when on a rider woody heraldson and i always have a name block with him
[26:25.200 --> 26:30.000]  who's the other big actor something junior he's an iron man everything else
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.200]  i met him hung out with him robert downey junior
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.000]  robert downey junior i'm in this movie uh and
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.200]  the movie uh is off a philip k dick book about a corporation selling drugs
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.040]  that fries your brain so they can basically program you
[26:47.040 --> 26:50.560]  through the television set in the culture to be a
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.520]  mind control zombie for them was written back in the 70s
[26:55.520 --> 26:59.120]  and it's kind of a analogy uh or a parable
[26:59.120 --> 27:02.320]  to be compared to how the government ships in heroin and cocaine
[27:02.320 --> 27:06.400]  to then set up a police state philip k dick who wrote blade runner
[27:06.400 --> 27:10.160]  and uh you know so many other uh well it was called androids who
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.120]  do androids rim of electric sheet but it was the movie title was blade runner
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.880]  i guess blade runners to blame now and and and so limbaugh
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.920]  after fall sleep being blamed uh for the last four or five days for this
[27:23.920 --> 27:30.000]  shooting he now turns around and uh blames the left
[27:30.000 --> 27:33.360]  i mean they could go around to his friends and family all day and find out
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.040]  that this guy was into all sorts of stuff and yes it is true
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.080]  that three years ago he would be called what you call a leftist
[27:42.080 --> 27:47.360]  but still who he was three years ago is not who he is today
[27:47.360 --> 27:50.640]  and that's not a conservative that's not a libertarian
[27:50.640 --> 27:56.160]  that's not a liberal but a guy clearly whacked out of his mind
[27:56.160 --> 28:01.040]  who told his friends he didn't know what reality he was part of
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.320]  and so what what limbaugh is doing is playing into this blame game
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.560]  and then obama can come out and say everybody cool it's all of our faults
[28:08.560 --> 28:13.520]  let's stop arguing and being angry let's sit down and shut up
[28:13.520 --> 28:17.280]  no we need to be angry we need to get focused we need to get up off our couch
[28:17.280 --> 28:19.760]  potato positions and take our government back
[28:19.760 --> 28:25.520]  here's a quick clip of limbaugh the shooter's favorite films in addition to
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.040]  the documentary zeitgeist and loose change the movies
[28:29.040 --> 28:36.160]  donnie darko and a scanner darkly now zeitgeist is a 2007 documentary
[28:36.160 --> 28:42.720]  that asserts jesus christ is a myth that 911 was orchestrated by the government
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.120]  and that bankers manipulate the international monetary system
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.680]  and the media in order to consolidate power who denies that
[28:51.680 --> 28:57.600]  so a conspiracy movie put together by deranged leftists it turns out
[28:57.600 --> 29:01.840]  appears to be according to his best friend the most
[29:01.840 --> 29:09.360]  influential media event of this young man's life loose change is a series of
[29:09.360 --> 29:13.760]  films released between 2005 and 2009 which argue also that the
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.640]  911 attacks were planned and conducted by elements within the u.s government
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.080]  so he's a truther or he bought into this notion
[29:24.080 --> 29:29.680]  that people like a couple of hollywood lefties i forget their names have
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.520]  advanced the notion that bush was behind all of all right that's enough we'll
[29:33.520 --> 29:36.560]  be right back in comment on this and then take your phone calls
[29:36.560 --> 29:40.800]  this is all playing into the censor's hands what you're seeing happen right
[29:40.800 --> 29:50.000]  now
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.560]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[30:11.440 --> 30:14.880]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have

[30:19.040 --> 30:23.520]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[30:23.520 --> 30:27.600]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.600 --> 30:31.040]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[30:31.040 --> 30:34.640]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[30:34.640 --> 30:38.560]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[33:37.840 --> 33:42.080]  we're gonna go ahead and play the audio in the video of a scene that i was in
[33:42.080 --> 33:46.080]  with keanu reeves when on a rider in a scanner
[33:46.080 --> 33:52.320]  darkly back in 2006 shot here in austin and supposedly
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.720]  showing someone in the near future it's set in 2014
[33:56.720 --> 34:00.480]  not allowed to be on a street corner bullhorning if you do
[34:00.480 --> 34:03.920]  a black van pulls up and guys jump out in black uniforms
[34:03.920 --> 34:07.920]  and taser you uh and then drag you away
[34:07.920 --> 34:11.840]  according to limbaugh as you just heard movies like this
[34:11.840 --> 34:17.520]  are liberal and it's causing this person to go shoot people so
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.120]  limbaugh is becoming everything he criticized
[34:21.120 --> 34:26.640]  uh in bill clinton in 95 blaming limbaugh for the
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.600]  oklahoma city bombing and others uh blaming uh currently limbaugh and
[34:31.600 --> 34:35.840]  sarah palin and myself for what happened it's just all made up
[34:35.840 --> 34:39.760]  i mean i'm sure this guy saw thousands of movies
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.520]  and there's never any issue in the media about him taking an hallucinogen
[34:43.520 --> 34:46.320]  every day about him being out of his mind about him death
[34:46.320 --> 34:52.400]  threatening people and the sheriff and the police doing nothing
[34:52.400 --> 34:56.560]  none of that is an issue and all of this plays directly
[34:56.560 --> 35:03.120]  in to the hands of obama who gets up there and says everybody be cool
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.280]  in fact uh here's an associated press article
[35:07.280 --> 35:10.720]  uh covering it there's also one out of the national journal obama our hopes
[35:10.720 --> 35:14.960]  and dreams are bound together and it goes on
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.800]  offering no easy explanations but yearning to be
[35:18.800 --> 35:24.480]  i have hatred and division put aside president obama offered a string
[35:24.480 --> 35:29.520]  of powerful memorial statements wednesday for those killed and
[35:29.520 --> 35:33.920]  wounded at the get together with
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.400]  us representative gabriell giffords husband
[35:38.400 --> 35:42.400]  and he offered off the cuff electrifying news
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.160]  i mean does anybody believe that this was offered off the cuff
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.600]  that for a nation hoping for gifford to pull through
[35:51.600 --> 35:55.680]  so right up there he broke away from the teleprompter it's so amazing
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.800]  he can talk on his own and he offered off the cuff electrifying news for a
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.080]  nation hoping for gifford to pull through
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.240]  gabbie opened her eyes for the first time today obama told the crowd
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.400]  while his wife michelle gripped the hand of giffords husband
[36:12.400 --> 36:20.000]  nasa astronaut mark kelly and it goes on uh to how he called for people
[36:20.000 --> 36:27.200]  to stop being so uh divided so polarized for us to come together
[36:27.200 --> 36:31.040]  for us to not blame each other both on the left and right
[36:31.040 --> 36:36.960]  so obamas got all of his surrogates running around saying it's sarah
[36:36.960 --> 36:40.480]  palin saying it's rush limbaugh ron paul
[36:40.480 --> 36:44.800]  alex jones the list goes on and on and on and then this big
[36:44.800 --> 36:47.920]  fight erupts as the republicans take the bait and say
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.480]  he's not a conservative he's a liberal which is true
[36:52.480 --> 36:56.720]  he was a liberal in 2007 2008 2009 and then he got into
[36:56.720 --> 37:02.560]  deviltry and trying to shock people and taking hardcore drugs almost every day
[37:02.560 --> 37:07.200]  some days multiple times daily and didn't know what reality he was in
[37:07.200 --> 37:11.040]  according to all his friends and hated all political parties and the news and
[37:11.040 --> 37:16.080]  everything else and said he didn't believe this reality was real
[37:18.960 --> 37:22.560]  and so that's the fault of a movie that's anti drug
[37:22.560 --> 37:27.440]  about how drugs can destroy your mind and and and and how drugs can be used by
[37:27.440 --> 37:30.320]  the government to to turn you into basically a
[37:30.320 --> 37:36.480]  subservient mindless zombie like prozac that's to blame
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.960]  no there's 300 million people plus in this country and it's no one to blame
[37:42.960 --> 37:47.040]  but that guy and his parents and his upbringing
[37:47.040 --> 37:52.320]  so it's this collectivized view that we're all to blame for what he did
[37:52.320 --> 37:55.680]  and now you notice the media blames everything
[37:55.680 --> 38:00.240]  they blame scanner darkly they blame donnie darko
[38:00.240 --> 38:06.800]  they blame the left they blame the right and then we all play into it
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.720]  looking at everything this guy was into when every individual is into thousands
[38:12.720 --> 38:16.000]  of different things and now ascribing blame and that obama
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.800]  comes right in at the crucial time and says everybody stop it this is
[38:20.800 --> 38:24.000]  ridiculous we need to all come together and stop
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.960]  being negative and be positive well if your legs cut off you can think
[38:28.960 --> 38:31.200]  positive all you want but if you don't tie a
[38:31.200 --> 38:33.600]  tourniquet around it and stop the bleeding
[38:33.600 --> 38:38.320]  it's a certainty you're going to die you're going to bleed to death
[38:38.320 --> 38:42.080]  but if you are positive and think
[38:42.080 --> 38:45.600]  hmm what did i read about a tourniquet needs to be placed
[38:45.600 --> 38:48.800]  up a little bit past midway on the hip
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.080]  to tie down those big arteries i need to tie this as tight as i can
[38:54.080 --> 38:58.640]  to cut off the circulation so that it stems the bleeding so that a clot can
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.920]  be formed in the stump okay i've done the tourniquet now
[39:03.920 --> 39:07.920]  i'm dizzy i'm almost going into shock but let me take off my shirt and tie it
[39:07.920 --> 39:10.960]  around the stump to again help form that clot
[39:10.960 --> 39:16.800]  is that negative your legs been cut off you're going to pass out in a matter
[39:16.800 --> 39:20.160]  of minutes if you don't get a tourniquet on there from shock
[39:20.160 --> 39:23.440]  after you go into shock you're going to die now
[39:23.440 --> 39:27.280]  obama would say let's just be positive everybody seems to be agitated
[39:27.280 --> 39:30.320]  that the country's going into a cardiac arrest that the foreign banks are
[39:30.320 --> 39:33.440]  looting the daylights out of us that our liberties are being butchered that
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.560]  citizens are being trained to spy on each other that homeland security's
[39:36.560 --> 39:40.960]  main focus is gun owners returning veterans libertarians a secret police
[39:40.960 --> 39:45.360]  is being set up tortures continuing we know we're going in the opposite
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.600]  direction of liberty and freedom should we wake up should we get involved
[39:49.600 --> 39:53.200]  should we get informed should we speak out should we get angry
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.320]  should we shake the public out of their trance
[39:56.320 --> 39:59.520]  that's happening people are awakening they're getting angry they're getting
[39:59.520 --> 40:02.640]  focused that's the first stage of awakening
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.560]  your car alarm goes off at three a.m the first thing you do is go
[40:06.560 --> 40:10.000]  oh darn oh you might say something else
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.160]  what's going on the dog starts barking you stumble over towards the window
[40:14.160 --> 40:19.280]  you open the window to see what happened why your car alarm's going off
[40:19.280 --> 40:23.280]  the first step is being angry finding out what's wrong
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.880]  and then fixing it but they're telling you no no no
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.680]  don't be angry don't be involved don't don't speak out to your neighbors just
[40:31.680 --> 40:35.680]  just follow our agenda they've already tried everything oh you
[40:35.680 --> 40:38.320]  don't like government run healthcare and death panels you don't like black
[40:38.320 --> 40:40.000]  people you're like what does that have to do with
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.480]  black people oh i see racist
[40:44.480 --> 40:47.760]  oh you don't want to have the tsa put their hands down your pants
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.280]  you must be for the terrorist you must want airplanes to get blown up
[40:53.280 --> 40:56.640]  oh you don't want the feds to have the power to shut down any family farm or
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.880]  ranch they want and have unlimited power to to
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.920]  push any amount of regulations they want a blank check
[41:03.920 --> 41:08.480]  you must not want the egg supply to be safe you're like what big agribusiness
[41:08.480 --> 41:12.560]  did that and they lobbied to set up this food safety act to shut down their
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.840]  competition oh sure conspiracy theorist but see
[41:17.840 --> 41:21.840]  now 80 plus percent awake to the federal reserve in a matter of years
[41:21.840 --> 41:25.840]  people have totally started to awaken people are awakening to the new world
[41:25.840 --> 41:28.720]  order the global government and here's limbaugh saying
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.760]  this crazy left-wing loon liked a movie made by deranged people you can call
[41:35.760 --> 41:39.200]  them what you want but they're not deranged very good filmmaker
[41:39.200 --> 41:44.560]  had a lot of skill now it's a deranged filmmaker
[41:44.560 --> 41:48.560]  that made zeitgeist deranged
[41:49.520 --> 41:53.200]  and the deranged person thinks big banks
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.920]  are manipulating the currency worldwide have you read the wall street journal
[41:57.920 --> 41:59.760]  limbaugh have you read the financial times of
[41:59.760 --> 42:03.600]  london it's admitted they're manipulating it congress has hearings
[42:03.600 --> 42:05.840]  about it and limbaugh you're 60 years old
[42:05.840 --> 42:09.200]  you're sharp you're highly intelligent you're not stupid
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.040]  you know full well there's a new world order and a federal reserve
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.520]  and we've done our job so good in the true libertarian patriot
[42:17.520 --> 42:22.240]  liberty movement that even though the sean hannadies and limbaugh's and others
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.400]  for decades limbaugh said the federal reserve isn't private
[42:26.400 --> 42:29.600]  anybody that talks about it is a kook anybody that talks about global
[42:29.600 --> 42:32.400]  government is a kook anybody that talks about the cfr
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.240]  that openly writes a book every month the publication in book form
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.680]  calling for world government that we're kooks well guess what
[42:41.680 --> 42:45.200]  you know what it signifies when glenn beck is forced to talk about the cfr and
[42:45.200 --> 42:48.960]  the rock of fellers and sterilization and world government and new world order
[42:48.960 --> 42:52.320]  and private federal reserve and goldman sacks
[42:52.320 --> 42:58.320]  it shows that we've won and the establishment is forced to cover it
[42:58.320 --> 43:03.280]  the establishment is forced to admit that this stuff is real and so limbaugh's
[43:03.280 --> 43:07.040]  falling back on his 20 year old schtick of saying
[43:07.040 --> 43:10.480]  oh you're a crazy lunatic if you think there's an international banking
[43:10.480 --> 43:14.960]  cartel that's manipulating currencies all right i'm gonna go to your phone
[43:14.960 --> 43:17.520]  calls and then coming up in the next hour i'm
[43:17.520 --> 43:21.200]  gonna get into the financial news at the start of the hour then i'm gonna get
[43:21.200 --> 43:25.120]  into glenn beck yeah he can't have his cake and eat it too
[43:25.120 --> 43:28.720]  uh you you really find out who they're most worried about
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.800]  on the controlled left and the controlled right when
[43:32.800 --> 43:36.960]  the left the right all of them are grasping on the fact that he told a
[43:36.960 --> 43:44.480]  neighbor he liked loose change the preeminent film on 9 11
[43:46.400 --> 43:51.200]  it shows you what they're scared of they are in the establishment are so
[43:51.200 --> 43:54.080]  frightened you're going to learn about false flag tear
[43:54.080 --> 43:57.360]  and and and let's just for the sake of argument say 9 11 happened the way they
[43:57.360 --> 44:00.560]  said it happened it's impossible it's ridiculous
[44:00.560 --> 44:03.920]  the official story's been proven to be a fraud
[44:03.920 --> 44:08.240]  but let's just say it's all true what about gulfa tonkin being staged that's
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.120]  declassified what about operation gladio being declassified
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.560]  what about operation ajax what about the army field manual that wiki leaks
[44:14.560 --> 44:18.400]  released that the pentagon admits is real now they want to arrest whoever
[44:18.400 --> 44:21.440]  released it uh this is before bradley manning where
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.360]  they teach army captains in black ops and above how to stage
[44:25.360 --> 44:32.640]  terror attacks false flag now that's real and our government
[44:32.640 --> 44:36.320]  has staged terror attacks of course they've staged them other governments
[44:36.320 --> 44:39.760]  do it they see it cold bloodedly as a tool they must use
[44:39.760 --> 44:45.200]  because it's so effective as a weapon system of propaganda
[44:45.200 --> 44:52.240]  and it's the same situation when you have them
[44:52.240 --> 44:57.600]  seizing on tragedies using it to then create a collectivist guilt for the
[44:57.600 --> 45:01.040]  american people to then sit down and shut up and do
[45:01.040 --> 45:04.720]  whatever the big collectivist government tells us to do
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.520]  through the collective guilt while the republicans
[45:09.520 --> 45:12.720]  blame it on the liberals and the liberals blame it on the republicans
[45:12.720 --> 45:17.520]  obama comes up there to the fore and plays the part of the big daddy
[45:17.520 --> 45:21.280]  right when everybody's seeing through the blame game and he says you know what
[45:21.280 --> 45:25.680]  it's wrong to have a blame game together we thrive
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.160]  under my agenda let's lower the rhetoric let's not be upset
[45:30.160 --> 45:33.760]  let's settle down while the foreign banks rob you blind
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.680]  we've almost got this world government completed and if we can just get you to
[45:37.680 --> 45:40.080]  sit there and suck your thumbs long enough
[45:40.080 --> 45:43.680]  it'll be too late for you because you'll be so bankrupt as a nation
[45:43.680 --> 45:47.040]  that we'll use poverty as a form of bondage over you
[45:47.040 --> 45:50.480]  and then you'll be dependent on government no matter what you do and
[45:50.480 --> 45:54.320]  we've got you checkmated that's what he should have said instead he said
[45:54.320 --> 45:57.920]  oh look at michelle crying over here and of course the father's obviously crying
[45:57.920 --> 46:00.720]  his nine-year-old is dead he's genuinely sad
[46:00.720 --> 46:05.200]  and here's this politico communist fake vampire
[46:05.200 --> 46:11.840]  you know the vampire psychic vampire feeding off this psychic wound
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.200]  and there she is and it's all this big fake oprah moment
[46:15.200 --> 46:18.320]  with the crying and the rest of it and everybody's been given their pre-made
[46:18.320 --> 46:22.160]  t-shirt a rust job on t-shirts six seven
[46:22.160 --> 46:24.640]  dollars a piece but let's say they pulled political
[46:24.640 --> 46:27.280]  strings they paid three four dollars for those
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.920]  professional color t-shirts how they print up 14 000 plus in two days
[46:31.920 --> 46:37.200]  how they get them delivered how they get them draped over every one of the chairs
[46:37.520 --> 46:43.040]  see i mean you walk into a completely scripted event and it was a celebration
[46:43.040 --> 46:45.920]  the students are celebrating they've got their t-shirts
[46:45.920 --> 46:50.560]  the the head of the college is happy
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.840]  these are tragedy mongers these are tragedy vultures these are psychic
[46:55.840 --> 46:59.520]  vampires and they go up there and they play the part of the big daddy
[46:59.520 --> 47:02.560]  and they tell you who's bad and they tell you who's good
[47:02.560 --> 47:05.920]  and they tell you sit down and do what you're told and we can all have this
[47:05.920 --> 47:10.080]  big collectivist sports stadium nighttime rally
[47:10.080 --> 47:12.720]  hitler loved having his nighttime rallies they found it was much more
[47:12.720 --> 47:18.960]  effective with crowds and they've got what they want
[47:18.960 --> 47:22.880]  but the good news is polls show uh just the last five days
[47:22.880 --> 47:27.920]  an uptick in pro-second amendment views a uptick in record gun sales across the
[47:27.920 --> 47:32.400]  board including democrat uh members of legislatures and congress out
[47:32.400 --> 47:35.840]  grabbing guns oh it's having the opposite effect
[47:35.840 --> 47:42.240]  it's a backfiring you have failed and so the establishment is is is trying to
[47:42.240 --> 47:46.560]  blame all politically active people if you're politically active if you're
[47:46.560 --> 47:49.600]  informed if you're speaking out if you're involved i mean what is
[47:49.600 --> 47:51.920]  homeland security less is potential terrorist
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.880]  leftist conservatives pro-gun groups anti-abortion groups
[47:56.880 --> 48:00.560]  the entire political spectrum is listed as potential terrorist
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.440]  ron paul meetings are infiltrated by homeland security inspired on
[48:05.440 --> 48:08.320]  and the message to government internally is
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.240]  political action political speech is
[48:12.240 --> 48:16.000]  evil it's dangerous it's terroristic it's bad
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  and the attempted lesson here is political discourse
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.800]  political heated debate cause this well political discourse and heated
[48:24.800 --> 48:29.360]  political debate cause this country political discourse and political
[48:29.360 --> 48:31.840]  debate has been much more heated in the past
[48:31.840 --> 48:36.080]  with members of congress routinely shooting each other in the streets
[48:36.080 --> 48:39.520]  in duels presidents being assassinated
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.640]  members of congress being assassinated this is nothing new
[48:44.640 --> 48:47.920]  sure back then you had a much better chance of being thrown from your horse
[48:47.920 --> 48:51.760]  horses did it all the time piece of paper blows by they get scared
[48:51.760 --> 48:57.360]  throw you off into a tree you're dead do we ban riding horses
[48:57.360 --> 49:00.400]  a congress member has a much better chance statistically
[49:00.400 --> 49:03.600]  hundreds and hundreds of times better i've looked up the numbers of dying in
[49:03.600 --> 49:08.720]  an automobile accident or a plane crash do we ban planes do we ban cars no
[49:08.720 --> 49:12.720]  it's when you step back from it from an unemotional position
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.320]  they're talking about armored glass domes
[49:16.320 --> 49:20.720]  over the house and senate so people can't shoot them from the gallery
[49:20.720 --> 49:24.960]  despite the fact you go through three layers of security to get in
[49:24.960 --> 49:29.440]  they're talking about secret service assigned to every member of congress
[49:29.440 --> 49:33.200]  their own armed praetorian guard at their houses
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.640]  at their offices they're talking about the tsa taking on that role
[49:38.640 --> 49:42.720]  which they already planned to be on the streets of america as the guard
[49:42.720 --> 49:47.760]  of the congress people and then you know what's next federal employees
[49:47.760 --> 49:51.600]  all because a woman got shot in the face and a girl got shot and killed and a
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.440]  judge got shot and killed no matter how much security you pile on
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.520]  if somebody really wants to kill you they're gonna find out where you live
[49:59.520 --> 50:03.040]  or where you go and they're gonna wait and follow you and wait for their
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.640]  moment for years and they're going to get you
[50:06.640 --> 50:10.640]  no one is bulletproof and the system knows that
[50:10.640 --> 50:13.920]  and in many cases political assassination is carried out
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.040]  by governments and then blamed on patsies
[50:19.040 --> 50:22.000]  are we going to ban congress people riding in cars because that kills a lot
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.320]  more of them than guns so to so to airplanes
[50:29.680 --> 50:33.040]  all right we're going to go to john tim george shannon shon and others that
[50:33.040 --> 50:35.200]  are patiently holding when we come back directly

[54:04.480 --> 54:07.600]  you know i get so wound up when i'm talking about this because when you
[54:07.600 --> 54:11.360]  study advertising psychological warfare propaganda
[54:11.360 --> 54:16.160]  it's so staged and blatant then i'm listening to talk radio this morning
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.160]  even conservative talk shows they're debating whether that was a staged
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.600]  rally whether whether that was a d and c production
[54:23.600 --> 54:27.280]  of course it was with the t-shirts and the teleprompters and obama
[54:27.280 --> 54:33.760]  oh i've i've just gotten word she's she's she's open her eyes and it's
[54:33.760 --> 54:36.720]  almost like he's the great shaman that caused it to happen
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.720]  i'm going to your calls but i got so wound up last segment i said that i would
[54:40.720 --> 54:45.280]  get to this clip of a scanner darkly and i never got to it
[54:45.280 --> 54:52.320]  it's a short clip of one scene but now this is being blamed
[54:52.320 --> 54:56.640]  a rotoscoped film dealing with mind control
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.320]  let's go ahead and play that clip where did substance d come from why can't we
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.320]  stop it the bigger this war gets the more freedoms we lose
[55:06.320 --> 55:11.600]  the more substance d is on our streets can't you figure this out look around
[55:11.600 --> 55:16.320]  here look how far we've come humanity wasn't meant to live like this
[55:16.320 --> 55:20.080]  our every waking moment trapped in freight and stand
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.680]  it's time to stop submitting to this charity it's time to realize that we're
[55:23.680 --> 55:27.200]  being enslaved uh-oh it's our tax dollars at work
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.360]  we're taking this from ourselves hey guys i used to be one of you stop selling
[55:31.360 --> 55:42.320]  out your own species
[55:42.320 --> 55:45.440]  and that's enough and then uh when on a rider pulls up and asks me if he wants
[55:45.440 --> 55:48.320]  a ride while keanu reeves is watching this happen
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.280]  there were some other little scenes where i pop up on tv screens i'm like the
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.040]  prophet but they cut those out of the film i'm told they're on the extras
[55:55.040 --> 55:59.040]  i've never gotten actually i have the dvd but i've never gone and looked for
[55:59.040 --> 56:02.240]  other scenes i'm in you'd think i'd do that i'm just so busy
[56:02.240 --> 56:05.360]  fighting the new world order but great film produced by tommy pilotta
[56:05.360 --> 56:09.040]  directed by richard link letter and i guess there is an anti-government
[56:09.040 --> 56:11.520]  message there uh you know i'm out there saying the
[56:11.520 --> 56:15.200]  government's dealing drugs and then the government pulls up and
[56:15.200 --> 56:18.160]  takes me to jail like they would do in china
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.800]  so i guess that's anti-american to have an anti-authoritarian message
[56:22.800 --> 56:28.800]  i guess it's wrong uh that uh
[56:28.800 --> 56:32.080]  people are questioning gulf of tonkin even though it's admitted
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.120]  that it was a staged event and didn't happen to get us into vietnam
[56:35.120 --> 56:39.600]  it's unpatriotic to read the declassification
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.680]  no the north vietnamese attacked our ship vietnam was good
[56:45.680 --> 56:48.720]  and if you go with that then you've got to think every government's good
[56:48.720 --> 56:53.760]  so malay tongue is good and i guess you've got to believe hitler
[56:53.760 --> 56:57.920]  nope the the communist firebomb the rice tag and the furor
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.640]  had to do that to keep deutschland safe i don't question government
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.680]  together we thrive by shutting our mouths and not being angry and not
[57:07.680 --> 57:11.520]  speaking out we thrive
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.640]  unbelievable john in pennsylvania thanks for holding her on the year
[57:16.640 --> 57:20.400]  uh hi alex can you hear me yes i can uh how you doing today
[57:20.400 --> 57:24.560]  good i'm a long time uh show listener listening almost every day i've never
[57:24.560 --> 57:28.400]  felt compelled to call but this teacher business i own a teacher company
[57:28.400 --> 57:31.360]  be absolutely impossible to get that amount of t-shirts
[57:31.360 --> 57:35.280]  in a two-day period period this thing happened over the weekend
[57:35.280 --> 57:38.000]  they would have to order these things on monday they wouldn't be delivered till
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.440]  tuesday and the biggest order i ever had was four thousand shirts that took a
[57:41.440 --> 57:45.040]  week to print those well how big of an operation are
[57:45.040 --> 57:48.480]  you uh two small presses but uh you can't turn
[57:48.480 --> 57:51.520]  around something around that fast that you know i've worked i've worked in
[57:51.520 --> 57:55.040]  no no we tried to rush things out even with giant companies
[57:55.040 --> 57:58.560]  and they you know it takes time for them to get it design it
[57:58.560 --> 58:02.720]  check it even if you're right on top of it it would take
[58:02.720 --> 58:06.000]  with the biggest companies two and a half three days to get this done
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.920]  and and and so that means instantly they hit the ground going
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.080]  okay let's go ahead and roll out the 2012 election slogan
[58:14.080 --> 58:20.160]  together we thrive uh you know hope and change two together we thrive and i
[58:20.160 --> 58:23.840]  have no doubt from the evidence that that they day one

[58:34.080 --> 58:38.320]  admonish us not to criticize government because that caused it stay there
[58:38.320 --> 58:42.800]  john will be right back in 60 seconds are you tired of searching for great
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.640]  talk radio something more important search no more

[59:08.240 --> 59:11.520]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually

[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:11.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:17.360]  well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.280]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.360]  okay we were talking to john in pennsylvania
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:31.040]  and john was talking about how he owns a t-shirt company
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.640]  and that would be impossible in just two and a half three days because they only
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.480]  announced this back on tuesday to make 14 000 plus shirts professionally
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.840]  made all of the same design and then have them all
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:48.800]  nicely folded over the 14 000 chairs at the sport stadium
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.040]  for the obama psychic vampire event and i totally agree with you the only way
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.760]  they could have done it is if they started saturday with the design in the
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.120]  order and i got a sneak and suspicion this together
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.880]  we thrive thing is the new t-shirts for the new rollout it's the same basic
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:10.880]  obama hope and change design and you watch this is going to end up
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.600]  unless it backfires and it's starting to uh being the 2012 election slogan for
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.800]  obama really i think that's what it would be
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.080]  um well you think about when they make the superbowl shirts when the superbowl
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:25.280]  wins uh the losing team they make as many shirts for the losing
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.560]  team as they do the winning team the losing team is destroyed but they have
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.000]  about two weeks leave time to know what teams are playing with each other
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.120]  uh you know you got to consider you know the design is a pretty simple design
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.920]  what's on the shirt wouldn't take that long to do but you have to burn the
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:42.480]  screens then of course you got to find a a press that doesn't have any jobs on
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.640]  board and then they go ahead and print them
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.400]  yeah that's also our problems we use you know several different groups here in
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.000]  the us it'd be a lot cheaper we went with mexico but we don't
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.040]  and a lot of times you know we call it they go we're backed up for three weeks
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.880]  but yeah we'll get to your job when we can but again obviously government
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:05.040]  has the the the power and the strings to pull the other issue is
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.680]  who paid for 14 000 shirts looking at this shirt design
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.440]  uh and also i know short notice costs more but bulk also gives you a discount
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.200]  how much to print those shirts even on cruddy quality shirts what three bucks a
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.240]  piece uh well yeah one quarter if i got two weeks
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.920]  to do those i could do them for about 354 bucks a piece but like on a one day
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.360]  turnaround time those shirts would be 10 15 dollars a piece
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.120]  not that short of an also who had 14 000 black shirts
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:35.680]  lying around i think they were navy i was looking at the car which are
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.120]  you know navy black and white t-shirts are the easiest shirts to get
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.160]  from the distributors because you know but basically 1400 shirts is a
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.800]  container load
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.200]  you know it's a full shipping container of shirts well they could have also gone
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.280]  with a bunch of different subcontractors that could have done it as well
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.000]  now this is true you know it just depends on the brand and what they and
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.600]  well what this means is they immediately capitalized
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.960]  immediately politicized it with an hours blamed it
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.480]  on anybody that was against their gun control or open border
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.760]  or health care agenda i mean we know they did that
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.360]  and then now it turns out if you had to give him a political persuasion
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:19.920]  he he was a liberal before he completely used drugs and fried his
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.600]  brain and it's it's just crazy that this
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.920]  happened and that obama would try to put collective guilt on everyone and say
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.440]  we've got to now sit down and shut up and come together
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.880]  in the memory of this dead little girl when the father
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.320]  of a little girl is saying don't use this to take freedom
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.800]  i mean these people are tragedy vampires they are psychic
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.760]  vampires john i appreciate your call tj minnesota you're on the air
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.520]  alex hey buddy it's a great day for alex jones and myself and
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.920]  that uh limbama recording that you played was very revealing i'm not a
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.080]  limbama a knight i'm uh individual and i heard a
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:11.360]  report on the news i it might have been on coast to coast or npr i don't know
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:17.760]  but some woman was very elated that obama showed up
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:24.320]  to dispel anger over murder and insanity yeah and if you get
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.520]  neuterized from anger over murder and
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.240]  neuterization you ain't worth spitting my book

[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.760]  800 25 9 92 31 i've been pretty wound up lately dealing with this because
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.440]  people are debating whether or not the democrats are seizing on this crisis
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.240]  they obviously are and then coming up glenn becks trying to blame it on
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:02.560]  9 11 truth alex told you the government announced
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.360]  recently that the recession is over it ended on june of 2009 the millions of
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.160]  americans unable to find work might not agree
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.600]  perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.080]  for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.520]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long

[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.320]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think

[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.080]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:13.600]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:23.600]  best-selling author rad mesler has a show called decoded
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.280]  on the history channel it's getting a lot of viewers
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.040]  and he came out earlier in the week and admitted that he's secretly worked for
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.280]  the u.s government so i thought i would talk a little bit
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:41.760]  about that and how so much of the media is government infiltrated government
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:45.600]  manipulated i'm not saying specifically decoded
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.120]  but some of the other productions that are out there
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.440]  a medsler described how he was hired to create scenarios
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.360]  of potential terror attacks so the government could think about every
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.960]  scenario that's out there and i have no doubt that that is
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:06.080]  what he was told it was for but in my research and in my films in the last
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.200]  15 years we've documented that governments have been
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.440]  caught using plans written up by sometimes entire
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.160]  hollywood script writing companies that homeland security and previous to them
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.280]  the pentagon would hire to write up scenarios
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.160]  we would then see those very scenarios secretly written for the pentagon
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.480]  used in real terror attacks and there's a great
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:34.240]  example of that we'll be talking more about with mark dice next hour
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:40.560]  and that's the lone gunman x file spinoff that aired six months before 9 11
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.320]  where a secret government group hijacked a passenger jet
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.520]  by remote control to fly it into the world trade center
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.600]  to blame it on militants in afghanistan to invade afghanistan
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.280]  and it's an element in the government doing it they use a drill
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.240]  to make norad stand down to think it's part of a drill
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:05.040]  that exact thing there was a drill norad stood down
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:09.440]  we know there was a hijacking terror attack drill of the exact same targets
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.920]  being hit at the exact same times that's abc news by the way
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.320]  i mean that's mainstream news they had a drill of the exact same targets exact
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.520]  same time in england on 7 7 in 2005 the same thing
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.520]  in madrid a year before and they really do this so
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.480]  that there's all these terror attack plans
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.400]  in different agencies that are scripts so if they're agents
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.760]  or contractors are caught about the stage of terror attack
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:43.840]  they just say oh this is part of a drill these aren't actual terror attack plans
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.000]  and it's written as a script to make sure everybody carries it out
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:54.240]  including patsy's patsy's on 7 7 patsy's on 9 11
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.160]  lee harvey oswald thought he was part of a drill they can then burn their patsy's
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.840]  and have their patsy at the location they want them to be at
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.480]  i'm going to talk about that next hour with
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.640]  a great researcher mark dice who's an author and researcher who was one of
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.560]  the experts they had on one of the previous decoded shows
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.080]  dealing with the statue of liberty and what it really symbolizes
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.600]  and he explains them that it is given to us by the french illuminati
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.520]  who are in the encyclopedia there's no doubt about the german french illuminati
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.680]  and at the time they made it they sent it over here it is a man it's not a woman
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.400]  it is lucifer and that's even in the main line literature from the time
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.600]  and then they kind of make fun of mark dice and others and they go and talk
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:46.720]  to a top professor and he says no it is lucifer but it's the good lucifer
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.840]  aha so we're still conspiracy theory cooks we're right about it being lucifer
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.640]  but it's the good lucifer so we'll talk about that
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.600]  but right now i'm i'm i'm opening the phones up
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.800]  at 800 259 9231 recapping here dealing with
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.520]  obama getting all of this political gas mileage at least he hopes
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.560]  out of that staged event 14 000 t-shirts that they had to start producing on
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:20.000]  saturday of the shooting this is introducing his new campaign
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.520]  slogan mark my words unless it backfires they're gonna use it
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.440]  and they may not because it's backfiring uh but it'll probably still come out
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:33.600]  that this is the new term together we thrive and that means sitting down
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.960]  shutting up not having a political debate
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.360]  and he went on to say republicans stop it democrats stop it
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:45.280]  oh see his surrogates get to blame alex jones rush limbaugh
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:49.040]  sarah palin but then he gets to get up there and say stop it
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.640]  it's all of our faults being mean to each other let's not do it
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.960]  it's nobody's fault that guy was taking hallucinogens every day now
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.160]  first it was almost every day now we're learning sometimes multiple times a day
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.640]  he was smoking one of those hardcore hallucinogens that many people
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.880]  have a disassociative event and i've now the emails are pouring in by the
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:13.360]  hundreds i mean you're talking about just don't even
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:17.120]  know who you are for 20 to 30 minutes
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.200]  and he was on this this plant that comes out of mexico
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.280]  that the Aztecs and others took you know they call it the ultimate shaman drug
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.880]  and he he goes from being a liberal but you can't blame liberals for the what he
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.880]  did because then he stopped being a liberal a
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:33.920]  conservative anything and started dressing up like the grim reaper and
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:38.160]  hallucinating and worshiping a skull shrine
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:41.760]  like every other psychopath there they're always into skulls and death and
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.800]  killing animals and dressing in black what's going on here
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.280]  now that doesn't mean everybody that likes to dress in black is bad johnny
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.400]  kash dressed in black to say like he was a preacher
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.600]  so he can carry out some of the darkness on his back as he said
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.680]  but there's this mo and and i called it on sunday
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.360]  sunday on my broadcast four to six 24 hours after the event
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:11.680]  i said person on hardcore hallucinogens into devil worship boom next day it
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:16.320]  comes out i know how to call it i do my research
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.080]  does that stop glenn beck from blaming anybody that questions 911
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.400]  or talks about government sponsored terror but glenn beck's got a problem
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.240]  glenn beck has talked about the government staging oklahoma city
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:32.000]  glenn beck has talked about that they may stage a new one in blaming on him
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.160]  and you know what when he came out and said that i said he may have woken up
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.080]  i may be able to support him now well every day since monday
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:43.040]  and we're now four days into this and i've got the report he was doing it today
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.880]  on the radio he's blaming 911 truth and saying we're violent we're going to
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.960]  attack i'm talking about that coming up the last 20
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.640]  minutes of the shower but right now let's go to the calls who's up next here uh
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.920]  john george in canada kid you're on the air thanks for
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:59.520]  holding uh yeah you went all over the place i had a
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.120]  couple things i could have added but i just just one last thing i'd like to add
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.240]  before i go into my other suggestion is that
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:12.960]  chertoff is your your lucifer that is the name of the former s tsa and his name
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:18.000]  in russian means devil look it up by the way i heard that about
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.160]  seven years ago when uh he was in underling in the bush administration
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:26.240]  and didn't believe it and i looked it up in online russian encyclopedias
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:29.600]  it it it means actually son of the devil
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.240]  chertoff means son of the devil let's be accurate
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.840]  well i don't know my my russian dictionary got devil
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:41.440]  i've studied russian but maybe i'm wrong i'll double check it but anyway
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.840]  i think it's about time this missile situation and the popping up behind
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.120]  carriers the the chinese thing we should have probably have that benjamin
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:52.240]  fluff uh was it a full four to ever his name isn't
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.920]  somewhere down the line because i'd like to hear his take on are they trying to
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.920]  stop these people from their agenda or is there something we have to worry
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.320]  about about the chinese because maybe there's something
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.920]  a broader issue there that he might well there really is a chinese mafia and he
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.000]  really has written for forbs and other major publications and i have no
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.680]  doubt that he's been approached by the chinese and japanese
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.760]  mafia and told that they're aware of the whole eugenics operation
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:23.360]  uh i mean again um when you're in the media things like this
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.880]  happen i've had a lot of bizarre uh bizarre stuff happen i appreciate your
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.080]  call george really really interesting points on that front
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:35.120]  yeah while we're busy covering the uh Tucson shooting which is terrible but
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.720]  six dead when there are hundreds dying every day on america's highways
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.760]  there are hundreds being murdered every day in america
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.200]  with people breaking in their houses raping killing families
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.360]  none of that's on the radar screen they don't personalize all those other
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:54.880]  deaths they don't personalize the crime wave of illegal
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.320]  aliens murdering and killing at will and nobody can catch them
[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:03.040]  because they don't have real ids and just blend into the background
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:08.160]  i mean no one talks about the 30 000 dead now in the last few years on the u.s
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:12.400]  mexico border see out of sight out of mind but they're
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:17.040]  acting like it's the end of the world these six dead people
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.240]  and what's the moral of the story your speech did it your rhetoric the anger
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.120]  in america america's going to get a lot more angry
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:28.960]  over losing our liberties losing our economy
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:32.880]  that's the fault of the globalist who engineered this society to consolidate
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:37.040]  power for a post-industrial world so they can control our lives they want us
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.000]  bankrupt so we're beholden to government and the collectivist
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.360]  the russians it came out in their internal documents could have had bread
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.600]  and sausage for everybody in choice they wanted to make you stand in line
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.720]  they wanted to only give you enough food to barely survive
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:57.200]  they wanted to have you they want you under their control
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.720]  they shut down family farms and ranches our government's trying it
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.800]  shaw in arizona you're on the air yeah alex we've talked before god bless you
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.560]  i've got some quick word blanks and i'm so upset uh because i've been found
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.240]  that these things for 30 years we've talked three times before i've got
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.240]  Lyme disease and i'm absolutely shaking i was absolutely
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.240]  simply appalled what i saw i've been following these things for 30 years i
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.400]  worked for legan and whatnot and what i want to say that was a cross what we
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.920]  saw last night was a cross between a poor corai
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:31.360]  sensitivity training new-age positive thinking
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:36.480]  and failed socialistic disciplinary policies introduced into the public
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:39.920]  school it was Oprah Winfrey let me continue you're right
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:43.120]  absolutely right where the individuals are wrong
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.520]  uh we're going to we're going to uh disappoint the whole class this was
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:52.000]  the beginning of failed socialistic school policies in the 20 in the 60s this
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.800]  is why part of the reason why we are here today let me
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.200]  continue that took 20 federal and listen 20 federal
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:04.480]  marchers to transport this girl from Tucson to phoenix he's being held in

[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.840]  in about 30 seconds what i've been trying to say in the last hour but he
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.880]  said it so perfectly that was brainwashing that was a
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.240]  reeducation camp they're all given their prisoner's shirt

[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.920]  Obama the numbers are out and almost no one
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:29.040]  watches his press conferences no one wants to hear from him they're totally
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.320]  sick of him we've got all these internal White House
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.600]  memos that have come out and other Obama advisers like Robert
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.120]  Shapiro saying you need a crisis you need a tragedy
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.600]  to then go poses the savior and they're so cold-blooded
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.720]  they write about it in major newspapers like we're dumb
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.400]  and they're targeting people that are dumb but the good news is
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.240]  and Kurt Nemo's got a story out on this at infoawards.com I want to get it out to
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:57.520]  everybody attempt by Obama operatives to turn

[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.200]  take your time going over what you observed in that
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.480]  brainwashing rally last night that attack on
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.040]  free speech that collective guilt sovietization
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.960]  in a sports stadium a literal reeducation facility
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.000]  with the guilt of the dead girl and Michelle Obama
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.440]  crying i mean it was all disgustingly scripted
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.000]  you've got the floor thank you alexander you know i love this country as you do
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.600]  and that's uh... i get excited like you get excited somebody asked me the
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:43.440]  other day why does alex jones get so excited and i said because he loves
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  this country he loves freedom and he understands where we're at
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.960]  at a critical venture there are a couple bullet points that i don't know you're
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:55.120]  aware of on the national scene are you aware that sometime
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.000]  and uh... it may have been in the last ninety days
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.240]  uh... this individual disappeared for one week from his parents house and no
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.720]  one knew where he was are you aware that
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.600]  last night i was lying in bed and thinking about this for about an hour
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.640]  that there are hundreds of different points
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.880]  when put together my gut and i've told people privately at the office i've
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.640]  told my wife this i'm sure in my gut
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:23.920]  this was a government operation and that he was druged
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:28.240]  he fits the m o the history when this happened right as the republicans are
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.400]  coming in so that the democrats can try to set
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.160]  the agenda uh... and create the illusion
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:40.800]  that getting angry getting upset getting involved getting out of your trance
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.680]  getting out of your comfort zone is going to cause death
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.680]  how it happened when it happened the same story of all the threats
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.640]  him being protected uh... what he's connected to the drug he was on
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.200]  uh... the way these people all popped up
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.840]  uh... the whole thing the way the judge was there
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.280]  all of this screams staged event
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:06.240]  and my gut has never been wrong you know i said staged event two days after
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.280]  the underwear bombing on christmas day and it came out
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.480]  that the government got him on the plane protected him that he was under the
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:15.680]  control of known cia operative and we're all lucky
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.840]  fox news again even reported that that and we're all lucky is secretly working
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.800]  for the pentagon
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.400]  hanging out with the pentagon and so i wanted to give you the floor
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.840]  uh... here shon uh... to uh... go over
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.280]  that giant attempt uh... to make everyone have a love affair
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:37.760]  you know put people back under the obama koolaid the obama spell
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.040]  that everything was going to be fixed because obama is our savior
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:45.120]  i think it backfired miserably uh... but uh... yes
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.160]  in my gut i know this was staged uh... to what degree i'm not sure
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:53.280]  but all the evidence is there and my gut told me
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:56.080]  instantly uh... you know that day what it was
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:59.040]  uh... but i don't just go with my gut i go off the facts but i mean what do you
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.080]  think
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.680]  absolutely we are we're on we're branch country here and uh... when the governor
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.440]  came on and i'm not a supporter of hers and it saturday and asked to lower the
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.320]  flag
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.080]  i wrote over to the other ranch uh... they have a huge american flag there and i
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:14.880]  told him the governor asked to lower the flag and there were some people
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:18.160]  from out of state there and they said what has happened or who do you think
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:20.160]  has done this and i said well the media
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:23.520]  who knows who's done this but the media will blame this
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:27.200]  on a right-wing nut but a couple other points critical things
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:30.160]  what people don't understand here throughout the united states is this
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:30.960]  dumnick
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.240]  the sheriff in toosan that's one of two liberal
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.680]  enclaves in the state of arizona the other one being the new age hub
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:41.520]  up there in sudona and that you know he doesn't uh... he doesn't i don't look
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:43.680]  at him as a guy that speaks for the west
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:46.320]  what i also want to point here is to another thing
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.800]  that's been happening increasingly over the years
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.560]  and it's really a it's appalling uh... it as a westerner
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:56.960]  i'm appalled hot on how my fellow countrymen have sunk so low
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.200]  that they need uh... and obviously it was a tragic event but now we need the
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:05.280]  president to fly in to console us and you know we live here in the west where
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.480]  the sons of the pioneers you know there's some hearty people in southern
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:12.160]  areas that sells us the message that the feds have to be involved in
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.000]  everything and the feds and the big daddy president
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.880]  has to hold our hand robert Shapiro admitted that they needed this
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:23.200]  admitted that they were going to use this
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:28.960]  i mean they're handing out campaign t-shirts uh... here
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.760]  sean uh... well said sean i'm gonna go to brad thomas nate scott at least you
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:37.200]  guys and then i'm gonna get into this
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:42.080]  other angle not just the communist socialist liberals working for the big
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:45.200]  banks trying to demonize conservatives
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.800]  and libertarians for this shooting but now the limbaugh
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.400]  beck response trying to blame we're on the march
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:30:00.640]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.840]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.840]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:15.280]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.160]  it's true total government control of electricity
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.680]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.280]  in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:29.200]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:32.800]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.840]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.960]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.440]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.200]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.920]  agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:15.120]  and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.840]  worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.800]  they've begun their long expected journey to the moon

[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.960]  know it will be more precious than any financial resource
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.680]  you and your family need food to survive a crisis

[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:06.960]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:11.840]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:26.080]  thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:31.120]  okay let's race through some of your calls and then i want to get
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.520]  into what limbaugh and becker doing now demonizing
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.680]  the left but going further they're now
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.520]  using the same tactics to go after 9 11 truth
[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:47.040]  and people that criticize the private fellow reserve
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.240]  even though that's something that both of these men
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.520]  themselves have now been forced to criticize
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:57.040]  because people do understand the fellow reserve is private
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:01.600]  so what's happening is mainline conservatives are being forced more and
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.080]  more to stay relevant they're being forced to cover
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:12.000]  real issues they can't just stonewall but then when there's an event like this
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.440]  they fall back to the old pattern of demonization
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.960]  that's coming up right now let's talk to brad in michigan brad thanks for
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:23.520]  holding her on the air thank you alex um it's an honor as always um
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:29.600]  just a quick couple points um on you know the whole t-shirt rally thing
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:32.720]  um i think it's together we can be bootlicking slaves
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.880]  because that's really what he's saying um on the shooter
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.160]  in Arizona you know for one guns don't kill people people kill people
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.040]  and if they want us to sit down and shut up how about stopping the tyranny
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.040]  stopping the corruption stop giving us the things to talk about
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.880]  if you don't want us to talk about these things stop your actions
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.720]  it's that simple we will not shut up we will not stop
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.440]  well that's right got great points brad government never shuts up it's trying
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:07.920]  to put up billboards and messages to our kids in school and
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:12.160]  constant psas and now telescreens at 9 000
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:15.200]  walmarts and targets and everywhere else they're going in
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.000]  telling you to tattle on your neighbor government
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.080]  is forcing its way into our lives hyping up things that
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:25.920]  statistically aren't that dangerous trying to make us afraid
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.840]  and then they say oh don't have a blame game don't be afraid
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.280]  just give up your individuality don't be upset about the direction of the
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.800]  country sit down and shut up and together we
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.400]  will thrive that is the opposite of liberty and
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.360]  freedom that is something out of the borg
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.640]  right out of star trek i appreciate your call amazing
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.240]  simple but focused truth from brad uh let's talk to thomas in canada thomas
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:57.040]  you're on the year thank you alex sir um i just wanted to let you know that
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.040]  cnn newsroom right now headline 9 11 flag honors christina green
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.840]  born september 11 2001 um is that just a coincidence or is that an icbm
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.480]  mind control missile aimed right right in north america
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.600]  no i totally agree with you and i meant to cover that from the start of the
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.720]  broadcast today that's in my stack again watching it last night and reading
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.480]  the news everything is carefully choreographed just
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.400]  like the government paid for t-shirts over every seat
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.680]  you know magically produced in just a few days uh you know michelle crying
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.520]  all of it so that you see humanity in them
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:37.840]  and so that you then stand down against the globalist takeover
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.480]  it's a serious sigh but the fact that she's born on 9 11
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.480]  and and the media from day one saying this is like a 9 11 and a lot of people
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.800]  were saying why are congress people on both sides of the aisle
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.960]  why is the media calling this shooting a 9 11 when it's not
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.280]  they're trying to re invoke that togetherness
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.800]  but instead of attacking iraq and afghanistan we'll attack our bill of
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.480]  rights and constitution we'll we'll do whatever the banks say and give up all
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.600]  of our money we'll allow the carbon taxes uh to be
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.400]  put into place and so it's all about this collective strike against us all
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.960]  and then we learn who was behind it why we were we're sorry
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:24.080]  we won't get angry at what the ruling class is doing
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.280]  and oh they're going to bring the 9 11 flag
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:32.640]  so that there's solidarity and then associate the 9 11 attacks
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.240]  with this and and and there's more than that you notice the last few years they've
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.680]  been slowly admitting okay almost none of the
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.520]  funding and training is for foreign men wearing turbines from caves
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:48.160]  in central asia uh the funding is really for libertarians gun owners
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.640]  conservatives uh and and white al qaeda they're
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.520]  going to get you they're everywhere and now they're
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:00.400]  saying this was an act of terror this was white al qaeda hillary in speeches
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.040]  worldwide says we have our own extremist we have white al qaeda
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.120]  and and so this is the big rollout of here's the 9 11 flag
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:15.200]  it's 9 11 the second amendment is 9 11 free speech is 9 11 getting upset at
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:19.040]  government is 9 11 arizona and it's heated political rhetoric
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:22.160]  because the people aren't putting up with tyranny uh they're they're demanding
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.080]  sovereignty that's 9 11 and and and so absolutely it's all
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.720]  acting on the subconscious but they raise the propaganda right up to the
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.840]  conscious level as well but most of it's going on at the
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.520]  subconscious archetypal level and that was a giant soviet nighttime
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:42.720]  brainwashing uh event and that is what's so
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:46.720]  incredible just like telescreens telling you to spy on your
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.160]  neighbor and to trust no one but big sis is directly out of 1984 i mean they
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:56.960]  are hitting every archetypal event hitler would have nighttime rallies
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.600]  for dead sa or ss who'd been killed fighting commies
[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:04.880]  and and and would cry and have others crying and
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:08.240]  night and and everyone was being given you know little patches that they were
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.680]  at that rally well in america you get an obama shirt
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:14.720]  and he teaches you to come together under him
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:18.720]  and do what he says because together we thrive
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:23.120]  as hitler said i invoke i'm the right i'm pure
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:29.760]  one people one land one leader and together we have strength and that's
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.600]  exactly what's going on so we've seen it under mal under stalling
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.480]  under hitler under pole pot we know what an authoritarian brainwashing rally
[01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:42.000]  looks like and this was it and for those that no history it
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.760]  completely freaks us out for an opera watcher they thought they were watching
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.640]  an episode of opera and learning to love obama
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.000]  because after all he says he's fighting wall street he's not going to have wall
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:55.920]  street fat cats in his administration when that's all he's got
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.840]  oh we've got the the daily fellow in there now who helped
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.360]  right naftan gat and who helped get glass teagle repealed
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.600]  to allow the derivatives to be written and then obama says last week
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.240]  he's going to save us oh and and i'm not supposed to get angry
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.240]  i'm supposed to have hope and change here anything else uh thomas
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:20.800]  yes um secondly with the speech last night um it just looked like a film set
[01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:24.080]  uh i say that just because watching it after he spoke
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:27.280]  he was so twitchy obama he was nervous looking he was looking around at the
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:30.560]  prompters you know trying to hide it by kissing his wife and uh
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:33.920]  at the end there they had a moment of silence suddenly obama starts looking
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.920]  around to see if he would stand up or not
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.840]  alex he almost got up but then he looked around and then he sat back down
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.520]  i mean they have him in the front row while he's while in the state stadium
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.880]  and they're just applauding him i mean with the t-shirts and now
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:50.960]  the alternative media with this event it is so in the open alex that you are
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:54.560]  really tuned into government brainwashing or you are openly against it
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:58.560]  there's no in between anymore oh i mean it is i mean that's it it's cartoon
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:03.760]  i mean i've seen disney films uh you know about the nazis that
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:10.960]  that are themselves cartoon uh propaganda uh but you watch cartoon
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:16.160]  representations of hardcore brainwashing authoritarian evil
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:20.240]  and then you superimpose what was seen as absurd
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.800]  tyranny 60 years ago you superimpose that over today
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.760]  and it's like they took 1984 or they took the nazis they took the soviets
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:34.480]  and they're openly doing it the most absurd things out in the open it it's
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:38.320]  just too wild i appreciate your call i'm going to get to nate
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:43.600]  scott tim racial and others um before my mark dies gets on or while he's on we
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:48.880]  may even go into overdrive the day i'm pretty i'm pretty wound up and and
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:54.880]  but i want to shift gears right now and i want to talk about glenn back rush
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:42:00.160]  limbaugh sarah palin and others on saturday on sunday on monday
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:06.800]  when the uh democrat hit machine was blaming rush limbaugh sarah palin
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:12.000]  glenn back myself and many others uh for what happened
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.680]  i went and did the real research saturday and sunday and said he was
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:20.320]  somebody who was rejected by women this is all on record sunday before any of
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:23.200]  this was out i am owed him from the pieces i had
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.880]  i said he was rejected by women uh he was guaranteed on some type of
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.480]  psychotropic drugs either prescription or hallucinogens
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.640]  that are in the same family that he got on the street uh he was into the kind of
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.760]  goth extreme you know shock uh devil movement that is so
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:48.560]  risky and seen as avan guard by uh people 14 to 25 or so
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.360]  and he was into the death culture and it all came out monday and tuesday and
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:57.120]  wednesday that was the truth and it blew up in the democrat's face that it
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.280]  wasn't sarah palin it wasn't rush limbaugh it wasn't
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:06.400]  ron paul you know they tried to demonize conservatives and libertarians
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.840]  and then we learned that when he was a liberal
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.000]  three years ago 2007 2008 that's when these reports came from
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.480]  he was long-haired pot smoker wasn't taking the hallucinogens every day
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.680]  uh that that this guy
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:30.640]  lofner i call him the grim reaper killer now it's confirmed it is him dressed up
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:35.600]  in the grim reaper outfit you know playing the drowning pool music that
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:40.080]  again is into death and destruction and nihilism and and and giving up on life
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.360]  i also predicted that he was just a suicidal guy that he wanted to be killed
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.360]  by the cops or by a concealed carry shooter now they have his letters that
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.760]  he wanted to be quote assassinated at the event
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.240]  this was his not just death by cop you know suicide by cop this was
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:05.680]  suicide by mass murder but he failed and so we know who he was and we know
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:11.440]  that three years ago he was a liberal but then he changed
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.400]  so it wasn't fair to call conservatives and libertarians people that were
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.880]  responsible even if he was a libertarian or a
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:20.880]  conservative how is what a one crazy person does everybody else's fault
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.640]  again it's this collectivist view that your neighbor does something wrong
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.000]  so you get in trouble that's what the soviet union and the nazis did
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.920]  that's another hallmark of authoritarianism that's what's so dangerous
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.720]  about this if you're going through a playbook of
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.400]  authoritarian tyranny on every front they're doing it
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.680]  there's no doubt that's where we're going and i'm supposed to shut up about
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:44.640]  that or i'm encouraging violence against the government
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:47.360]  they're also trying to create a psychological compulsion that there's
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:49.920]  never a right to be violent against the government
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:53.120]  was it wrong to fight hitler was it wrong for people to try to overthrow
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:57.440]  Stalin and of course we all know there are times
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.080]  to stand up against governments so they're also trying to create
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.840]  this obsession on never standing up against your government and attaching
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.840]  the image of standing up against your government
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.800]  not to george washington or thomas jefferson
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.920]  or the people in romania in 89 against chelchescu
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:18.480]  it's about attaching the image to a crazed lunatic out of his mind with a
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:21.760]  demonic look on his face dressed up like a grim reaper
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:25.840]  so there's layers of this propaganda as government comes in to take your liberty
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.920]  to take your pension fund to jack up your taxes to shut down your local farmer
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:34.240]  ranch to to to engage in all of this tyranny
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:37.600]  this raping they're going to take events like this
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.640]  and blame it on the american people who have the answer
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:47.120]  to the 1984 society which is 1776 they're going to try to brand revolution
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:52.880]  whether it's verbal or physical and i believe the pen is mightier than the sword
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.640]  the video camera is more powerful than the collision to cough
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.400]  or the cult m16 i do believe in that but they're trying to demonize all forms
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.160]  of resistance as evil they're trying to brand resistance
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.040]  as this guy and that's why i've spent so much time on it
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:18.400]  sure it's hype sure it's a media hoax there's a lot of other stuff going on
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.720]  behind the scenes but we have to cover this because if they win in this fight
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.640]  in this info war on this subject they're going to be able to deep six the first
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.400]  amendment and the second amendment and then everything else follows
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.440]  so yes this whole thing is a big overblown hoax
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.120]  but we've got to expose it as a hoax or they win
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:43.840]  this is the big fight right now now all that's going on and what does glenbeck do
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:48.000]  glenbeck comes out and says 9 11 truthers i've told you they're going to be violent
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.360]  how did you know that glenn that's one of the thousands of little things i can
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:55.280]  add into the pile that this was a setup just just one of them he said mark my
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:58.320]  words 9 11 truthers are going to get violent they're going to attack and i
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.000]  think back to four years ago we're at a bush event somebody comes out of a dark
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.360]  alley with his daughter in a wheelchair and runs it into a we are changer
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.960]  and then it turns out the whole thing was staged remember that
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:12.480]  came out in court it was staged and fox news ran
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.080]  9 11 truth or a tax disabled girl in wheelchair
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.800]  notice it's a little girl that got shot see that's a little piece to add
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:23.760]  you go over the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds it's got to be over a
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.320]  thousand points and you see it's all scripted it was all written it was all
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.400]  prepared it was all set up
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.920]  and you can see the democratic operatives all over the news preparing to
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.280]  set up glenn beck
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.960]  you can see them preparing to set up yours truly on media matters
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.480]  george soros every week saying alex jones and glenn beck
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.920]  they're going to cause an oklahoma city and beck properly
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:53.840]  researches oklahoma finds out it's an inside job he comes out and says
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.040]  the democratic operatives are getting ready to stage a new
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:02.800]  oklahoma city and blame it on me and he points it himself
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.640]  now he comes out this week and talks about domestic people staging oklahoma
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.760]  cities he talks about 9 11 truthers being the biggest
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:12.160]  danger
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.440]  see glenn started getting scared that he was about to get set up
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.120]  and so he decided to tell the truth but that's why you can't trust him
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.560]  he flip flops and so we're gonna have to hold mark dice for about 15 in
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.440]  because i've got to get to this and i promise that i would
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.000]  but i'm going to go ahead now and play glenn beck
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.920]  just two months ago pointing out that the democrat operatives are preparing to
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.800]  stage an oklahoma city and blame it on the libertarian
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.520]  conservative movement here it is why does the left need this violence well
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:49.440]  listen to a clip from a democratic pollster mark penn happened just the
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:52.800]  other day and yet no one pays attention to it
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.160]  how can the left win the country watch
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:01.920]  cabinets don't don't really sell things president himself has to reconnect
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:06.400]  with the people remember president clinton reconnected through oklahoma
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:12.080]  right and the president removed and it wasn't until that speech that he
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:15.280]  clicked with the american public that's what last night was about with obama
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:19.680]  a similar kind of words that worked for reconnecting obama needs a similar kind
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:24.560]  of event oh look like oklahoma city if only
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.920]  barack obama couldn't have the opportunity to speak to america after
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:31.440]  another oklahoma city type event then he'll politically
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:38.560]  be in good shape wow now according to drum and pike the
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.000]  founder of tides who drum and i hope you watch this week because
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.760]  oh it's all coming undone this week i will be the guy who causes the next
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.240]  oklahoma city this is in a letter an appeal to advertisers
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.640]  uh of fox dear fox advertisers read this part of it
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.840]  no one left right center wants to see another oklahoma city the next assassin
[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.040]  may succeed if so there will be blood on many hands
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:10.000]  they are setting up another oklahoma city they are claiming that one is coming
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.880]  and they've already marked the one who caused it
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.040]  but don't you miss wednesday okay when i show you violence and the pressure
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.680]  so exactly as i was saying for months because it wasn't just that pollster
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:27.520]  it was robert supero and many others saying we need an oklahoma
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:32.960]  to blame it on domestic groups so obama composes the savior and reconnect
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.840]  back started reading the media matters and others saying
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:39.680]  jones and beck will cause it it's going to be their fault
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.640]  and he goes on tv and says they're targeting me glenn beck yeah me too glenn

[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:14.960]  okay it's a very positive sign that he goes on air and talks about the
[01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:18.000]  fellow reserve being private and world government
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.840]  and population reduction in eugenics we've challenged him in the last two
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:24.880]  years to go further we know he researches and watches this
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.040]  show and that his writers pull a lot of information from it
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.840]  and so to glen glen i watched you the last few nights
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.640]  really engaged in schizophrenic activity you know you'd say
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.000]  how dare the democrats talk about any type of symbol
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.280]  that could incite violence we'll look at the target logo
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.160]  are we going to ban that and how tired you are of people twisting things to
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:53.360]  blame folks politically i've watched you for four years
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:57.600]  cnn and now fox constantly say 9-11 truth is going to be violent
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.680]  when 9-11 truth had never been violent
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:05.600]  and then magically it starts to happen
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.720]  now did you just do a statistical breakdown and look at polls
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.280]  as high as 83 the new york times question the official story
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.720]  and just figure well there'll be some violence from somebody that has that
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:21.040]  view 80 plus percent of the population or were you given an inside track
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.320]  because i've seen the federal government in new york
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:27.680]  try to set up we are changed for attacking a girl in a wheelchair
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:30.960]  which turned out to be completely a hoax they attacked
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.640]  them and kept running the wheelchair in and screaming and it turned out it was
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.960]  all a staged event leading right back to the white house
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:42.240]  i know you're following talking points i know you went and met at the white
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.080]  house but you can't have it both ways glenn you can't say
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:50.400]  the democrats are preparing a new oklahoma city which they are
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:53.840]  and there's no doubt it was the democrats and we have the evidence and
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:55.840]  got over it at nauseam and made the film
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:01.120]  america destroyed by design oklahoma city was an inside job
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.040]  but i don't know i got a bunch of clips we'll never have time to play them all
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.840]  but where he says that 9-11 truthers are going to stage an oklahoma city
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:12.880]  where he says 9-11 truthers are the most dangerous
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:16.720]  so democrats aren't bad republicans aren't bad it's 9-11 truthers
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:21.680]  don't you look at government sponsored terror this is a dangerous game you're
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:25.840]  playing here back and uh well let's go ahead and
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:29.520]  start playing one of the clips here he is you know the moral of the story this
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.200]  is two nights ago is these 9-11 truthers they're the ones that are
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.720]  really dangerous here it is pull out there that
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:41.600]  i think are dangerous that actually believe that 9-11 was an inside job and
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.040]  that george bush was responsible for wiring it
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:49.280]  up and blowing up the world i think some of those people are nuts
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.520]  hit pause so um it just goes on and on um
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.520]  he's been telling us there are people who are dangerous because they believe
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:04.000]  and behind him he's got a in fact put that back up for me just the image that
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.720]  a recipe for danger people who believe that the government was behind 9-11
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.400]  so see they take this tragic event and the democrats are saying it's people
[01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:16.800]  that want to get rid of government healthcare people that want to control
[01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.880]  the borders you're the reason this happened
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:24.640]  and beck is saying no no no it's not them it's the 9-11 truthers
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.320]  they say the government could stage terror well beck you just got done
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:31.920]  saying that obama and his people might stage in
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:36.720]  oklahoma city or that they were planning one to blame it on you
[01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.640]  so you're dangerous too this thought is dangerous
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:46.240]  governments blow stuff up our government has declassified over 200 cases
[01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:52.880]  where they've done it so i'm not dangerous and i'm not crazy
[01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:59.440]  beck because i know how to read the associated press the new york times the

[02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:31.760]  so if you just joined us i played a clip of back two months ago
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:35.440]  glenn beck saying the government through the democrats may
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:39.680]  excuse me not may he is preparing a new oklahoma city bombing
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:44.960]  to be blamed on glenn beck well that's the george soros publications are
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.640]  saying glenn beck and alex jones for some reason that we're going to
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.720]  cause a new oklahoma city and so uh
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:56.080]  then he went over all these democratic operatives saying how that he did a new
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.440]  oklahoma city for obama to play the part of a victim
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:04.720]  and a savior and reconnect with us what bill clinton did in 1996
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:07.920]  he had like a 35 percent approval rating they had the bombing
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:12.560]  he had a 70 two days after it happened carried it through the election
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:15.760]  posing as our big daddy news to the democrats
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:20.160]  we're not in 1995 anymore we've done our job of exposing
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:26.800]  the idea of people staging attacks or using attacks to take our liberties
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:31.120]  no one can deny that they are using 9-11 to take all of our basic liberties
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:35.040]  and pointing homeland security at the american people
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.640]  no one can deny that basic fact
[02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.800]  so i play back saying the government is preparing and is
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:48.640]  getting ready to blow up another oklahoma city and blame it on conservatives
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:52.000]  and libertarians and you better bet your bottom dollar they are
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.880]  all the signs and evidence is there they're prepping
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.960]  and then two months later he gets up there and it goes on for like 10 minutes
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:02.560]  i'm not going to play any more of it i'm going to put a video together uh today
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.680]  that will play tomorrow that has it all put together tightly as you can see the
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:08.400]  history of it i'm going to do that with erin dykes
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:11.200]  he works up here mainly at night we're working off this evening
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:17.280]  uh for you tomorrow uh but just look at the hypocrisy of this
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.080]  bet goes from the the government is getting ready to stage a terror attack
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.080]  to blame it on domestic groups and glenn beck specifically
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.120]  and then now he's saying 9-11 truth i told you they're dangerous because they
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:34.160]  think the government might stage terror attacks
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.480]  but then that means you're dangerous glenn because you're talking about
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:41.760]  groups staging attacks to blame them on you
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.720]  and you're talking about dangerous ideas that if people
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:48.400]  have ideas they're dangerous what are the democrats saying
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:52.240]  you don't like the fellow deserve you don't like government run health care
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:56.480]  you don't like all of this you are a terrorist
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.320]  so it's the same thing and now we see the democrats and republicans
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.360]  now with the hoax that conservatives did this is blown over
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.520]  you now see them unifying to say conspiracy theorist
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:12.080]  people that think that there's mega banks manipulating currency worldwide
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:15.440]  which is admitted fact and people that think government
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:18.880]  might be staging terror there to blame the democrats
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:22.160]  and rush limbaugh the king of the republicans
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:27.840]  are now in unison on that talking point and when you see a convergence of the
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:31.760]  left wing and the right wing of this tragedy buzzard
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.080]  this tragedy vulture you better know who they're scared of
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.320]  and they're scared of 9-11 truth they're scared of you learning about gulfa
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:44.080]  tonkin and ajax and north woods and gladio
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:47.600]  and nato option and all the other stage terror attacks
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.040]  they're worried that you're going to find out about government sponsored terror
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.960]  and you're going to be watching when the state departments ordered by the cia
[02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:57.760]  to get the underwear bomber on the plane on christmas day
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:00.960]  you're going to be watching when it comes out that am or all the locky
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:05.360]  the number one active operative in al qaeda is admitted cia
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:09.200]  hanging out secretly at the pentagon with the secretary of the army
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:12.640]  while he's on the most wanted list you're going to find
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.920]  out that they're using terror to take your liberty and freedom
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:21.040]  and to tell you to politically shut up every time something happens
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:25.040]  you're going to shatter their paradigm and realize they are the terrorist and
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.720]  they're staging the terror attacks as a pretext to set up a police state
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:32.160]  and take our freedoms and when the and when you realize that and when the
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:36.400]  general public realizes that and when that idea becomes the mainstream
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:41.760]  which it's now becoming their game is over

[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:18.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:22.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:27.040]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:30.960]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:34.080]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose

[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.280]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:09.520]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.480]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:07:12.480 --> 02:07:15.680]  americans at home i've turned the members influence
[02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.680]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:24.960]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:28.160]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:32.560]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:35.040]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.880]  Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches
[02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:42.240]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:45.760]  nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.960]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:54.720]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:00.480]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:08.560]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:13.360]  okay recapping just brazen naked hypocrisy
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:16.800]  glenn beck after telling us that the government's preparing to stage a new
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:21.760]  obama city to be blamed on glenn beck which they are doing
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:25.360]  he just doesn't mention that in all those talking points yours truly is added in
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:28.880]  with him for whatever reason
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:33.680]  now he says in the in the five minute clip i've got i've got another one minute
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:37.040]  clip we got a guest coming up so i have to play him tomorrow
[02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:40.400]  but i already played part of it that 9 11 truth is going to stage a new
[02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:44.000]  Oklahoma city and that 9 11 truth is very very
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.400]  dangerous uh and that 9 11 uh truth he told us
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:54.480]  was going to be dangerous and that this guy was a 9 11 truther
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.880]  so he's doing exactly what he blamed the democrats for and being a hypocrite
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:05.040]  because by his logic anyone that says government might stage a terror attack
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:09.600]  is a dangerous delusional person who may shoot and kill people
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:12.640]  well then glenn are you planning to shoot and kill anybody
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:16.000]  this is a very dangerous game and i'm a 9 11 truther
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.280]  who's being demonized and i'm an Oklahoma city truther
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:24.000]  from day one and i know the facts of that case glenn just like you do
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.360]  and um it's creepy i mean you should be creeped out by the
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:33.040]  fact they're getting ready to set us up for a new Oklahoma city
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:36.160]  so i guess you're just wallowing at their feet and groveling
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:39.440]  saying don't blame me blame the 9 11 truthers
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:43.120]  say they did it glenn all week's been telling us
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:48.720]  it's wrong to blame uh somebody for violence just because of their ideas
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.640]  but then he comes right back and does the same thing they're doing
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.840]  now uh i guess michael sabbage is dangerous too
[02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:59.600]  huh glenn because he said over and over again on his show
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:03.280]  listeners send us the clips that the government is going to stage a terror
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:05.680]  attack and i'll tell you looking at all the evidence
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.120]  i believe this guy disappeared for not one week two weeks
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:12.080]  the government was all over him we're now learning he had been in some type of
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:14.960]  psychiatric care we're now learning this that the
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:19.840]  county is hiding his police records even though those are supposedly
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.720]  supposed to be public they are scared and you had all the other factors the
[02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:29.360]  drugs the rest of it the emo i believe this was a staged event
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.480]  and i believe what original witnesses said there must have been other shooters
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:35.200]  there but let's go ahead i mean regardless of
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.040]  that they're using it to take all of our freedoms but in case you forget
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:44.720]  here's michael savage talking about government sponsored terror
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:48.880]  now i'll make another prediction i predict that very soon
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:54.080]  obama will create a crisis along the lines of the rice dog fire
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.000]  i don't know what form it will take but i believe that once the minions are seen
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.760]  for what they are rama manuel and his gang will set off a
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:06.000]  rice dog fire in this country of some kind and they will recall the military
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.200]  dictatorship of lincoln and stanton during the civil war
[02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:12.480]  when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:16.160]  i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every night as i go to sleep
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:19.840]  i put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:24.880]  control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on earth
[02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:29.360]  and he goes on from there uh with a lot of historical evidence of that
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:32.800]  so michael savage can talk about obama staging a
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:37.120]  rice tag beth can talk about it beth can say they're
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:40.560]  getting one ready to blame it on him because he got old democratic operatives
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:45.120]  actually saying that what we need is a new oklahoma to blame it on our
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:48.800]  opposition and so you can reconnect mr president
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:52.880]  and i tell you that for month after month and then beth finally listens
[02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:56.480]  goes on the air and talks about it and then two months later is saying 9 11
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.720]  truth is evil 9 11 truth is six of the 10 commissioners
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:05.120]  saying the official stories a lie 9 11 truth is norad standing down
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:09.200]  9 11 truth is building seven blowing up and falling into its own footprint
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:13.120]  at freefall speed and the police saying get back they're going to blow it up
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:18.240]  that's all a video pal i cannot ignore that
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:21.120]  oh the government will shoot up little kids with syphilis
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:24.160]  in guatemala but they won't blow up a building
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.360]  it's not the government it's criminal elements within
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:30.480]  they're like are you saying there aren't a muslim threat there are real muslim
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:33.120]  extremist but nine times out of ten of your research
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:37.440]  it they're being run by al-ciyeda by the pentagon
[02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.240]  i've been on major conservative talk shows and i go
[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:44.800]  what about and we're all a locky fox news and they'll go yeah i saw that
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:48.720]  that he was secretly at the pentagon let's move on i'm like no
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.880]  this is the guy running the ford hood shooter running the underwear bomber
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:58.000]  running all the rest of them and he's not a double agent he's
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.880]  commanding the operations so the government can take our freedoms
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:06.720]  yeah he's got crazy muslim lunatics working for him who really think they're
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:10.960]  fighting for halla but at the top it's run right out of
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.560]  the pentagon and i'm tired of it
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:18.640]  zeb picnic brzezinski has written a best-selling book bragging how in 79 he
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.560]  created al-qaeda on the Taliban
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:27.760]  you got to start thinking like a globalist to be able to counter this
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:30.320]  one last clip i want to take from the memory hole
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:34.400]  to remind you before we go to mark dice obama
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:38.400]  Missouri truth squads and they had sheriffs
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:42.720]  district attorneys police chiefs on the news this is one of many newscasts
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.280]  saying you will be arrested if you tell lies about obama
[02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:50.640]  and who decides no judge no jury no civil trial
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:53.600]  they will decide if something's not true and they went on to say
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:58.400]  if you say he's not a christian arrested if you say he wasn't born in america
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:04.240]  arrested this is who they are they want to ban free speech they've got armies of
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:08.160]  police in this country the the political officers on top
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:11.520]  who will follow those orders just like they have cops that will follow the
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.360]  orders to confiscate guns in new orleans and surrounding areas
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.280]  they're beta testing so when you hear them say they want to end free speech
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:23.440]  and bring in the fairness doctrine and shut down talk radio and have FCC control
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.680]  the web which they just declared two weeks ago
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.280]  and they've got all the cyber security bills lined up notice how this is all
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:33.680]  happening at once it was all lined up the legislations all lined up the
[02:14:33.680 --> 02:14:37.440]  republicans are coming into congress all this is happening
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:41.360]  some guy that his friends all said thought he was under mind control
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:45.840]  totally drugged up on an amnesiac drug doesn't know who he is
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:49.600]  and then this happens magically right on time and a nine-year-old who was born
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:52.720]  on 9-11 gets killed and now they're bringing in the 9-11 flag
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:55.680]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of other points
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.680]  it's staged it's staged and even if you don't think it was staged
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:04.400]  they're sure opportunistically seizing on it
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:11.600]  all right let's go ahead now and go to this clip
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:15.360]  of what they really want to do outside of the law
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.360]  they just say you talk bad about our god you're going to jail
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:23.360]  here it is early voting is not allowed in Missouri
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:28.400]  only absentee senator barack obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:33.600]  law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:36.720]  during the presidential campaign this was john mills is live at the county
[02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:39.840]  election board in maple but he's been learning more about which members of
[02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:42.960]  law enforcement are getting involved in this john tell us
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.000]  more about this russia good evening prosecutors and
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.240]  sheriffs from across Missouri are joining something called the barack obama
[02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:54.800]  truth squad two high-profile prosecutors are part of the team
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:57.600]  we met them this afternoon in the central west and
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:01.600]  they are jennifer joys from the city bob mccullough the st louis county
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:04.240]  prosecuting attorney they will be reminding voters
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:08.800]  that barack obama is a christian who wants to cut taxes for anyone making
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.600]  less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.720]  they also say they plan to respond immediately
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.720]  to any ads and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.400]  we want to keep this campaign focused on issues we don't want
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:27.120]  people to get distracted and the missourians don't want to be distracted
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.440]  by these divisive character attacks so we're here to respond to any
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:34.960]  character attacks to set the record straight whether it is
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:39.120]  directly attributable to the campaign or to one of the soft money operations if
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.160]  they're not going to tell the truth then somebody's got to step up and say wait a
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.840]  minute that's not true this is the truth
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:49.040]  now the obama campaign tells news four that others
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:52.880]  prosecutors and sheriffs are also part of the team including some from the
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:56.240]  Kansas city area and from rural parts of Missouri
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.240]  we're also told the truth squad is expected to include jefferson county

[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:08.560]  news four i can't handle it um i wanted to play that to
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:12.800]  remind you obama campaign this was going on all over the country
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:18.960]  the obama campaign with elected democrats operating in law enforcement
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:23.600]  capacities the obama campaign is working with
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:27.440]  missouri law enforcement elected ones who are part of the party
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:31.680]  that's nazi germany where the nazi party or the communist party
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:35.360]  comes out and says i'm gonna arrest you if you talk bad
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:38.720]  i say that's a lie no judge no jury no law
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.960]  they just do it so if you've got any doubt about the fact that they want to
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:47.840]  create an america where you are arrested if you criticize these crooks
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:50.960]  that's what obama is helping steal trillions of dollars that have
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  disappeared congress asked where is the money
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:57.840]  they ask them over and over again and they won't say
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.600]  and so if there's any doubt about these tyrants and i call the t-word
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:05.840]  there it is and don't think the republicans are going to save you
[02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:08.880]  you just saw glenn beck saying if you think the government
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:13.040]  was is involved in any type of terrorism you're a dangerous terrorist
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.720]  you need to shut up i've seen beck say the army needs to be used against ron
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:20.160]  paul supporters that's glenn beck showing us
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:23.040]  true colors now with us for the rest of the hour is mark
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:26.240]  dice author researcher we carry all of his great books
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:31.200]  on the illuminati on the resistance all available at info wars dot com
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.240]  uh and mark dice joins us because he was a big part
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.000]  of brad metzler's top rated history channel show
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.640]  uh i refuse to be part of that episode uh just because i was too busy
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.480]  and uh then they gave me an offer i couldn't refuse going back to bohemian
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.920]  grove that's going to be airing in the 27th this month so i was part of that
[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:53.520]  episode uh but mark dice was part of this episode
[02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:57.520]  uh but as we go to break though we're gonna give us your take on the shooting
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:01.040]  and uh all the stuff that's going on uh mark dice
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:05.040]  yeah i think your analysis of the shooting is just correct i mean obviously
[02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:08.400]  the conspiracy theorist and the mainstream media now have egg on their
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:12.080]  face the guy wasn't politically motivated it's clear that he says get
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:16.400]  the phrenic lunatic with no political affiliation whatsoever so
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:19.760]  i think that it's time that they all admit uh you know maybe
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:23.520]  tom and jerry uh the cartoons tom and jerry is about the only thing that i
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:26.800]  haven't heard uh blamed you know for sparking this violent
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.800]  streak in this young man but i think that just served as a wake-up call
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.880]  obviously everybody that came into contact with this man knew that he was
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:39.040]  mentally disturbed so i think that instead of implementing new policies
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:42.960]  taking away guns free speech how about when you come across the lunatic that's
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:46.400]  threatening to kill people uh numerous times that somebody actually maybe
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:50.720]  files a police report and the police do their job well said it turns out the
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:54.720]  sheriff is illegally suppressing this guy's real record
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:20:00.080]  and because he's the one that's liable letting this lunatic do what he did

[02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:32.960]  Oklahoma city the next assassin may succeed if so there will be blood on many hands they are setting
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:39.040]  up another Oklahoma city they are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked the one
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:45.760]  who caused it but don't you miss wednesday all right so he says that you violence and he says
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:49.760]  that pointing at himself and then he goes on to explain they're preparing to stage a new
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:55.600]  Oklahoma city then he comes back now and says that 911 truthers will stage in Oklahoma city
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:00.720]  and then anybody that thinks that government could ever stage something is a terrorist but now
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:06.560]  i mean he can't have it both ways mark dies because previously he was saying obama's people
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:11.440]  may stage one i mean what's going on with glenn back what's your view of him he's all over the
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:16.960]  map he understands that people's attention span is so short that he can say one thing and contradict
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:22.320]  himself the next day and people don't kind of you know catch him on it what this whole shooting
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:27.520]  says and then i want to move on to bread melts i get some incredible bombshells on this guy you're
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.520]  not going to believe but what this shooting says is two things that america's just completely so
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.680]  desensitized the craziness and violence that want to lunatic is running around saying he's
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.920]  going to kill people people just don't think anything of it because violence is such a big
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:47.680]  part of our culture and and also too you know this guy everybody that came in contact with this
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:53.040]  kid knew he was a lunatic there was no need for the walmart you know if you see something say
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:58.160]  something program there was no need to go snooping around looking to see if somebody's
[02:25:58.160 --> 02:26:03.760]  willing to attack this guy was in everybody's face so it's obviously just everybody is is
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:11.520]  incompetent desensitized to the violence and and that this is just a huge huge tragedy
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.000]  but but i got some bombshells on bread melts or we got to get into this guy okay now let's
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.240]  recap let's recap and what's left of the short segment come back in the next and obviously
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:24.800]  we'll have to go into overdrive and you got to go to work though again author researcher
[02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:29.360]  mark dies who joins us we carry all three of his great books at info wars
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:32.400]  dot com he's got a new book coming out the next few months that's going to be his
[02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:38.320]  most powerful and informative yet yet and he's going to debut that here but he was approached
[02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:45.120]  and i was approached as well by brad metzler who's this huge best-selling author dealing with
[02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:50.400]  quote conspiracy theories but he's kind of branding it in the establishment way to be part of this
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:57.200]  statue of liberty episode the secrets of it and i just said you know what i'm not doing it and they
[02:26:57.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  were shocked that i wouldn't want to be on the history channel then they came back later and
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:06.240]  they said we want to go back to bohemian grove with you and that was something that i said no to
[02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:13.920]  but then mike's whirling uh of some of our great affiliates uh there uh in uh central california
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:18.240]  it was really saying hey your listeners want you to come speaker so i went and spoke to a crowd of
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:23.440]  800 people twice so 1600 people it was great i killed two birds with one stone i said okay
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:30.880]  infiltrate bohemian grove on this date and i'll come and so they did it i had a very interesting
[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:36.160]  experience i'm not going to talk about it because i've agreed to until it airs uh coming up the 27th
[02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:40.080]  but they tell me oh it's going to be very fair oh it's going to be very nice seeing their other
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:46.400]  episodes that does not spark confidence in me but i was still trying to play nice with all of this
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:52.960]  now i see this article two days ago author brad metzler how do you pronounce his name melzler
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:28:00.080]  melzler uh was recruited in government agency horrified at how easy it is to attack us now now
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.720]  i've got comments on this as we go but in the two minutes we've got left go ahead and uh break down
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:09.520]  the bomb shells okay this is incredible so brad melzler is the guy that heads up the history
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.800]  channel decoded show the sort of modern day conspiracy theory show investigating conspiracies
[02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:20.160]  i'm in it yalex is in it there's other episodes uh of some other interesting topics that are going
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:25.680]  to be coming out too and so it it appears that his job after seeing the statue of liberty episode
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:31.360]  that i meant is to sort of debunk the conspiracy theories and then when you start looking into
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:35.200]  who this guy is and i i knew nothing about him before getting involved with this show
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:44.880]  on tuesday january 11th 2011 1111 he released a new book called the inner circle and just
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:49.920]  coincidentally happened to write an article in the new york daily news where he explained
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:55.920]  uh he came clean that he was recruited by um by the red cell project the government program
[02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:00.960]  to brainstorm terrorist attacks and then he starts bragging about all of his insider connections
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:07.840]  but what is so interesting is years earlier uh george bush 41 george herbert walker bush
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:15.360]  had read one of melzler's books and reached out to him and befriended him and and brad melzler
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:23.360]  actually credits george herbert walker bush with the plots of his new book the inner circle
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:29.120]  oh which is all about uh george washington had a secret spy ring and this is true i called it
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:35.040]  the culper of the culper ring yeah stay there so so you've got the skull and bones grandmaster
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:41.040]  former head of the cia uh this uh individual author's been brought in to work secretly for
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:46.560]  the government i mean i've got a really bad feeling about this this uh bohemian grove episode

[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:25.840]  bread metzler comes out in the news this week releases a book called the inner circle
[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:37.520]  he admits in it that really the idea for the book is bush the elder and i'm not going to get into
[02:33:37.520 --> 02:33:45.120]  what's in the upcoming episode because quite frankly i don't know i've never been approached
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:52.720]  with more paperwork and more stuff they wanted me to sign and i refused on the first episode that
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:56.800]  they want to be be part of the one that mark dies is in and so they came back said okay you don't
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.920]  have to do all that and i just had a bad feeling but at the same time it sounded pretty exciting
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:10.080]  to try to go back and watch them try to infiltrate bohemian grove but when i got in with the three
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.680]  hosts two of the three were pretty much attacking me acting like it was all a big joke then i saw
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:24.800]  the episode that mark dies is in and then i read quotes where metzler made fun of people before the
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:30.480]  episodes aired and said you got to see the kooks i got the crazies i got so it's all kind of proposed
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.600]  on the surface like it's going to fairly look at things but then i mean what does brad metzler
[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:40.560]  expect us to do when he's running around talking about how we're a bunch of crazies i mean that
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:45.920]  prejudice is the whole thing we're just supposed to sit there and take it and and then the statue
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:51.520]  of liberty episode oh these kooks think it's lucifer then they go to the professor oh it is
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:58.720]  lucifer but it's the good lucifer so this is basically the 33rd degree masonic view of everything
[02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:04.960]  they've done telling us how wonderful it is and like tom clancy was chosen to be a propagandist
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:11.840]  it's clear that brad metzler has now been chosen for that same mission as they can't ignore the
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:18.800]  conspiracy theorist culture they now are trying to become it but that's not going to work so you've
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:26.880]  got the floor break down the bombshells here mark dies yeah melzer was reached out george bush
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:32.160]  41 reached out to melzer in 2002 invited him to his houston home where they talked about life in
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:37.440]  the white house and the importance of presidents being surrounded by people they could trust and
[02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:43.920]  here in this our usa today article yesterday with the headline of author brad melzer is part of
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:51.840]  history's inner circle um bush says that yeah he considers brad melzer a friend and uh has his book
[02:35:51.840 --> 02:35:57.920]  right there and and melzer says that uh as a novelist i can write whatever i want but if two
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:03.840]  presidents are going to read the book i want them to say he got it right and people really
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:10.560]  appreciate your working it instead of just going to get in so they are hyping him as if wow this is
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:16.800]  the guy to go to for conspiracies and then we learn how loving uh the illuminati is uh but
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:23.200]  continuing uh with his brad melzer i mean it's just incredible that when they approached me they
[02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:28.240]  said no this is totally fair we really want to look at it we promise this isn't a hit piece now my
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:36.400]  episode you can see it on youtube uh you can understand the editorial uh creative you know
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:41.520]  decisions that they put into it i mean obviously you can you can watch it and see how it was peaked
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:46.560]  together it makes it look like we're discussing the the illuminati and then a police car has
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.280]  a siren go off and we got to get out of here that's that's all just editing it it's incredible what
[02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:57.920]  they can do but this whole guy's job he was his job is the new propagandist to whitewash
[02:36:57.920 --> 02:37:03.680]  conspiracy theories he's he's good friends with bush 41 who gave him the plot for his new book
[02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:09.600]  the inner circle about a oh it's george washington's secret spiring it's still going on today and
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:14.800]  it's uh it's a bunch of good folks don't worry about it and that the the lead character in his
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:21.600]  book beacher white works for the national archives so i guess bow this guy just maybe never looked
[02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:27.680]  up the operation northwood's d-class by document or the gulf of tonkin tapes to learn what sort of
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.320]  actual conspiracies go on and we're going to get into red cell in a minute he'd work he admits he's
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:37.120]  been recruited by the government i want to explain what red cell really does for those that don't know
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.800]  including members of red cell that are compartmentalized the big bombshell here is bush 41 is
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:49.920]  admittedly the grand poobah on the steering board of bohemian grove he is one of the top people there
[02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:57.440]  along with his son and uh this is bohemian grove striking back basically they're having their
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:03.040]  insider their best buddy who they write books with whose quote part of the inner circle
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:10.240]  go through every major conspiracy issue as the american people wake up to the secret establishment
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:14.400]  that's running this country the skull and bones and others that's what bohemian grove is is an
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:19.520]  offshoot of i mean they didn't tell me hey we're insiders we're good friends with the head of bohemian
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:26.640]  grove they didn't tell me that and uh that is how good of an establishment insider he is in this
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:32.880]  usa today article released yesterday again a day after his book is released following the day after
[02:38:32.880 --> 02:38:37.360]  his new york daily news article coincidentally of course released on the day of this book the
[02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:42.320]  usa today article goes on to talk about his book and it just plugs it and it says in parenthesis
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:48.800]  oh 2699 it even says how much it is you can just buy it right there they're promoting him so clearly
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:55.600]  but uh this guy not only is you know admitted good friends with with bush 41 but he is released
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:02.400]  private personal letter uh from bush because for the last few presidents there's a tradition of
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:08.000]  presidents leaving a short little note in the desk in the oval office for the future president for
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:13.040]  the incoming president just a funny personal little note nothing big but melter's trying to
[02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:17.920]  make it seem like the presidents are passing on you know the illuminati secrets or the the
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:23.360]  cul-per-ring you know spy circle of the president is still operating and they they need to and then
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:28.960]  they're they've got go to bohemian grove to just blow off steam uh you know it's it's so unbelievable
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:35.760]  man this guy is such an establishment insider it doesn't get any bigger than this bush 41 i'm
[02:39:35.760 --> 02:39:42.480]  pretty sure helps recruit him for the red cell program the red cell is a the secret program
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.440]  that they've they've had it periodically it's it's think tank is sort of a group of people
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:53.600]  get together and brainstorm ideas on how to attack america and they the red cell report was actually
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:59.760]  released by wiki leaks so you can you can go and get that you can read uh that is the conclusions
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:05.280]  of 18 leading academic terrorist experts former national security council department of homeland
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:11.200]  security officials mass transit security specialists etc etc and a novelist so i'm pretty
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:15.600]  sure bush 41 just pulled strings and got him affiliated with the red cell and by the way this is
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:23.440]  just like bush 41 never being in the cia but then becoming the director of it in the mid 70s
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:30.000]  kind of like brad melzer never part of the secret government operation at the very top of the pyramid
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:37.120]  but now he's magically part of the inner circle now he's magically part of the the red cell and
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.400]  imagine i'm talking to the head producer and i said i want to hear from you but this is not a
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:47.760]  government hit piece because i said the last history channel piece was so disingenuous that
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:53.840]  that we'd be speaking to a crowd of 500 people here in austin at a 9-11 convention uh event they
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:59.600]  would then wait to the hour long lunch intermission and shoot shots of every of the room empty and
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:05.280]  me talking to one person well hold on i want to finish they blew up the film they made my face
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:10.640]  look yellow i mean i work with video i know when they distorted it then they'd cut to glistening
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:16.160]  footage in high death saying expert popular mechanics admittedly hooked into the government
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.720]  for more than 100 years in black op propaganda hence the term yellow journalism and i said
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:26.080]  you're telling me this is different and they said absolutely we really are just looking at the whole
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:31.200]  thing it's an investigation i mean they didn't tell me uh because it was secret then now he can
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.480]  reveal it because of wiki leaks oh this guy's best buds with the president and he's going to reveal
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:42.960]  us the secret circle and how it's all wonderful and and and so here's the top bohemian grove guy
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:49.760]  guy and that's how these spies would work getting me involved taking me out there they're locked
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:56.240]  cocked and ready leading me right to him thank god i escaped i'm telling you this makes me sick
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.920]  yeah there's also guide stones episode coming out to in a few weeks and i'm pretty sure that
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:07.120]  they'll just conclude that it was either a just an eccentric environmentalist or a publicity stunt
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:12.240]  that the elverton granite association don't don't worry about it this not the illuminati it was
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:18.480]  just don't worry about ted turner calling it uh rc christian or rosa crucian uh never mind it's the
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.600]  official 500 million population in the un biological diversity assessments i never mind all the other
[02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:27.440]  calls for world government and population let it i'm sure that's going to be just fine too for
[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:33.280]  those interested um i have a relink the article you can get on mark desk dot com or search for a
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:39.280]  title what brad melton's decoded myth about the real meaning of the symbols of the statue of liberty
[02:42:39.280 --> 02:42:43.920]  and you know i we should maybe get into some of that too because some of your audience might think
[02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:48.000]  that you're you're you're a lunatic or we're lunatics for saying that it represents satan uh
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.280]  maybe we should kind of get into a little bit of that i want to do that mark we're going to hold
[02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:59.120]  you a little bit into overdrive in the next hour but looking at this going over this i'm i'm i'm
[02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:06.640]  pretty freaked out and i guess i've come to the point where i cannot do mainstream tv interviews
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:12.480]  i did ventura that was real they're now pulling not just one but other episodes and erasing it
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:17.840]  off dvrs under homeland security threats that's confirmed and the mainstream media isn't reporting
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:22.880]  on it that's big news under government orders they go into your dvrs and erase them now under
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:28.640]  government orders they're pulling episodes dealing with fema camps not denying the info is real
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:33.360]  that's why they are pulling it they're completely freaked out so i did that and it's being pulled
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:40.960]  but every other mainstream tv thing i do nightline uh it doesn't matter it's a stinking hit piece and
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:46.400]  to sit there and have people straight face tell you that we have no connections to the government
[02:43:46.400 --> 02:43:50.800]  this is a fair open piece and i'm like really because i've seen bad stuff out of history channel
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:57.680]  we promise yeah and and and and then oh i'm a government asset i hang out with the president
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:04.080]  who's the bohemian grove head and then he just expects us to lay down and take this yeah it's
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:08.720]  incredible i mean let's let's maybe get into some of the symbolism so people don't think that we're
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:12.960]  kind of jumping the shark here and and and well i mean hold on hold on mark i'm going to put this
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:19.600]  on screen for people uh guys put the uh brad melzer article from newark daily news up i mean
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:24.160]  they're saying right here he's part of a super secret government operation that war games possible
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:30.960]  attacks what they don't tell you and what patty melzer may not know uh is that and i've covered
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:36.160]  this for over a decade they have all sorts of hollywood groups writing scripts of of attacks
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:43.280]  then those scripts are used and red cell is used as a cover for black ops that if they get caught
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:48.000]  by other agencies or groups planning a stage an event they say oh it's just part of the drill
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:52.960]  yeah that's like tiger teams they're just tiger teams which supposedly uh you know our good guys
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.480]  that try to infiltrate uh systems to test security so yeah it's it's covert tiger teams that actually
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:05.760]  are are our actual terrorists yeah and then they follow these scripts just like again i get a call
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:11.520]  the star of the x-files is coming to your house he's all freaked out he he gets there uh it's dean
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:15.040]  haglin he says yeah the cia planted the stuff on us i don't want to get too much into it i'll get
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:18.240]  in trouble but you know six months before they planted that episode of the government flying
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:21.840]  the jet in the world trade center and they're attacking afghanistan it's insane it's incredible
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.520]  he got on air and said most of it later but the point is that they were they were writing those
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.920]  scripts and then they're they're used as covers and if somebody gets caught it's a lone gunman
[02:45:31.920 --> 02:45:36.560]  script and listen to this i have i'm looking at the red cell report right now again released um
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:43.520]  by wico wiki leaks um it's it's unclassified but it still says here that you're not supposed to have
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:49.120]  it and this is the what the red cell concluded they're 18 academics you know former uh homeland
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.360]  security officials think tank security specialists all the stuff this is what they concluded in our
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:46:00.640]  four page red cell report that thankfully wiki leaks uh released uh the concern over a future
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:05.760]  homeland attack there is concern over a future homeland attack but no more likely than before
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:11.680]  huh yeah one red cell participant said that the london attacks quote countered the perception
[02:46:11.680 --> 02:46:19.040]  that terrorists are running scared mass transit systems are a target buses train subways and
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:25.360]  their supporting infrastructure are identified as likely targets this was this is what this report
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.520]  did 18 specialists uh you know it's written at a fifth grade level to be given to the fbi it's
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:39.120]  unreal yeah i mean it's incredible uh well again i'm not saying that brad melzer at red cell even
[02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:44.560]  understands this but we know what red cell has been used for we know what similar things have
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:50.400]  been used for we know they always run a drill of the actual attack while it's happening so they
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:57.760]  can smoke screen all this red cell chatter also confuses uh nsa and others let me add this too
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:01.680]  but let's just say that let's give melzer the benefit of doubt that he's not an evil heartless
[02:47:01.680 --> 02:47:07.120]  comeback that that has conscious awareness of what bush 41 and his illuminati connections have done
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:13.840]  but but by by recruiting him by bush reaching out to him bring into his home he basically
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:19.600]  giving him access to everything that he's ever wanted now he's a piece he's compromised he can't
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:24.320]  go out and talk about these things you know he's his main character is a national archivist
[02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:27.920]  you think he's going to talk about northwoods or gulf of conkin like in the article in the
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:34.960]  usa today brad melzer admits that because he has that's high level fans i better get this
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:42.400]  right oh let me go back you just spurred my memory in 1996 and 97 i was approached by
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:46.960]  mid-level republicans here in town they would come down to the access station and say
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.840]  i was just talking to the governor the other day he really likes you you know we're going to be
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.880]  watching the show and seeing what you're doing and uh governor might want to meet you sometime
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:03.520]  and uh of course then later bush had me arrested at a rally in the new full well who i was and the
[02:48:03.520 --> 02:48:08.880]  rest of it but the point is is that then i had democrats contact me and go the democrats would
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:12.160]  like you to work with them i was contacted by well-known democrat he said well you'd talk
[02:48:12.160 --> 02:48:16.640]  off record i said yeah part of my journalism had and then he called me like a month later and he
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:21.600]  said how dare you say bill clinton's a traitor you're never going to get a job with us now so
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:27.680]  that is how they operate yes yeah he might not be you know in in the mail but now he's compromised
[02:48:27.680 --> 02:48:32.720]  now he would have to turn his back on his lifestyle and all the connections that he's been given
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:38.320]  and to come out with the truth so now he's just not going to this is the former head of the cia one
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:44.320]  of the head people at bohemian grove who is now credited with it with this guy's new book about
[02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:51.840]  inner circles and then oh man i am oh this is it's unbelievable i mean it's just quite quite
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:59.920]  incredible so you know maybe we could get into uh why is the illuminati you know created the statue
[02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:05.760]  and that the history and by the way that's all on public record uh let's get into the good lucifer
[02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:09.680]  and the bad lucifer let's get into that episode for shadowing what we're going to see with bohemian
[02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:16.240]  grove so my episode was that the secret uh that there's you know any encoded symbolism into the
[02:49:16.240 --> 02:49:22.960]  statue of liberty and obviously the it itself represents satan or lucifer they are one in the
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:29.360]  same uh the torch represents the light of prometheus the the greek allegory of prometheus
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:36.320]  stealing fire uh an analogy of of knowledge from the gods giving it to mankind same analogy or
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:41.600]  allegory as lucifer is the forbidden fruit to mankind so prometheus it's that same thing that's
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:48.000]  why there's a symbol of prometheus outside of rockefeller center symbolically representing lucifer
[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:55.840]  or their god of knowledge power and and information so you have the the illuminati set up design the
[02:49:55.840 --> 02:50:00.960]  statue of liberty the the designer predric bartholdi was a high-level illuminati into a cult
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:06.400]  symbolism gustav eiffel created the the structure in the supporting structure richard haunt created
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:11.120]  the pedestal all these guys are mason's you know people think that the statue of liberty is oh it's
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:16.400]  american it's a gift from the french well predric both for bartholdi the creator actually wanted to
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:22.880]  give his design to egypt uh and it was an egyptian goddess and they denied it they said no we don't
[02:50:22.880 --> 02:50:27.680]  want it here so then he turned to america and he said let's put it over here uh see do you have
[02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:34.720]  multiple layers of of symbolism within the statue you have the seven horns uh representing
[02:50:34.720 --> 02:50:40.640]  could raise the sun again uh enlightenment this whole analogy of the light uh that there's seven
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:45.280]  of them representing the seven seven stay there we're going to go over it and and what happened
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:50.400]  on the show it's it's amazing we're going to overdrive i may just make the show four hours

[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:38.320]  liberty and i was hoping this be a fair show you're well produced looks good nice host in the show
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:43.440]  you're very well done but when i sat there and watched them say lucifer's good i mean that's
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:49.200]  33rd degree new world order illuminati yeah and they didn't even explain i can't even imagine what
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:53.200]  the audience was thinking that's totally new to this material i mean i want to just really twist
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:55:57.440]  their brain around it so for people that are familiar with this or maybe people that are
[02:55:57.440 --> 02:56:03.760]  completely new to this it essentially the illuminati the high level 33rd degree mason's
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:10.800]  view lucifer satan has good whether this is a literal belief or an allegory it doesn't matter
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:16.160]  it's still the same they if their secret view that satan and the garden of Eden is good and
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:21.760]  that god is bad and that they since they know this and and they have this power that they become
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:27.280]  gods just like the other the allegory the story of you know satan and the garden of Eden tells you
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:32.640]  that satan teaches you to become a god and you rule that's what they believe so that's the the
[02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:39.200]  show said oh well it is a lucifer but they did because it's just a white bearer but they didn't
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:44.960]  get into he said it has nothing to do with the satan but lucifer and satan are exactly the same
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:50.640]  thing i'm tired of a cultist saying that they're not i have all the books i have the secret doctor
[02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:56.400]  and published in 1888 i have morals and dogma i have everything and and you know how laneable
[02:56:56.400 --> 02:57:02.240]  vossky manly p hall all these guys albert pike say satan and lucifer is the same thing yeah they
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:07.760]  don't tell the mason's till their 33rd degree this and i'm sick of mason's telling me it isn't true
[02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:14.960]  i mean it is a fact it is a fact lucifer lucifer lucifer they say lucifer and jesus basically
[02:57:14.960 --> 02:57:19.920]  are one two sides of the same coin yeah but and for people who are new to this what it is it's
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:25.040]  essentially it's sort of like the force where they view satan not necessarily as bad but as as good
[02:57:25.040 --> 02:57:30.720]  or neutral and then they become empowered with that super knowledge and so whereas all other
[02:57:30.720 --> 02:57:35.360]  religions you know you can walk into a christian church and they want you to learn about the
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:40.080]  principles of christianity or any any religion hey it's an open book for most of them most of
[02:57:40.080 --> 02:57:45.200]  the legitimate ones come on in learn about our stuff hold on you didn't tell me that it's got
[02:57:45.200 --> 02:57:54.960]  brad metsler uh or melzer on the cover of usa today doing an illuminati hand sign yeah notice
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:58:01.680]  that's yesterday's author brad melzer's part of history's inner circle blow that up and he's
[02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:05.840]  standing right outside the national archives again when we need to go post on brad melzer's
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:11.840]  facebook page that is his character the archiver beacher white should go and look up operation
[02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:17.360]  northwoods and learn some some real history yeah but he's doing a big masonic hand sign right there
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:25.040]  but then we're coaxing we're crazy see that's hurtful to sit there and and and you know like
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:29.040]  you talked about in the interview where he's like you ought to see the crazies i got and then
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:34.560]  meanwhile he's all into this stuff it's like oh the statue of liberty is lucifer but it's the good
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:40.480]  lucifer stay there hour number four straight ahead inside the illuminati as they go public and come

[02:59:53.680 --> 03:00:17.680]  direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:32.480]  our guys are getting another 20 minutes here today we're talking about red melzer
[03:00:33.520 --> 03:00:39.600]  who's doing masonic hand signs on the cover of us today talking about he's in the inner circle
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:48.480]  and uh his new book is inspired and and and and was helped along by george h w bush the
[03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:54.720]  illuminati chieftain of scollum bones cia and bohemian grove and then in elliott in the morning
[03:00:54.720 --> 03:01:00.400]  he's got the clip of one of his facebook on mark dice's facebook he's got the uh clip up there
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:05.040]  of him on there saying yeah you want to see the crazies i interviewed for this show so they're
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:09.520]  like we're looking into the truth we're going to find out if it's real but then here he is the
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:14.240]  creator of it who's he knows the market's quote there you know he's going to see if there's an
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:20.160]  illuminati oh but then he's going doing interviews calling us crazies i mean this is just classic
[03:01:20.160 --> 03:01:26.000]  and the media will promote it and try to put their seal on the conspiracy culture i got news for him
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.280]  he ain't gonna work is it mark dice no it's they're getting really desperate is getting very obvious
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:36.000]  but what's so funny another few points in this show there was a guy named steven bolac who appeared
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:40.080]  in one of the previous history channel shows about the freemason talking about how great it is
[03:01:40.080 --> 03:01:45.440]  so he's in this one and they they see him they find him and they say you know dr bolac is there
[03:01:45.440 --> 03:01:50.800]  any secret symbols in the statue of liberty so he says no and these guys have been looking into
[03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:55.840]  freemasonry supposedly been searching for the illuminati his whole life as the show says but
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:02:02.080]  he doesn't see any secret message in the statue at all and then he says oh well i just don't believe
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:06.640]  that the illuminati exists or there's any inner circle or anything like that let me because i'm a
[03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:11.920]  big guy and sourcing i don't like to just make statements i like to go to the source i like
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:18.960]  proof i like evidence so here's here's manly p hall one of freemason's most prolific philosophers
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:26.240]  and and identified so by the scottish right journal the official magazine of freemasonry
[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:32.640]  okay identifies this guy as one of the head freemasonic scholars and he says that freemade
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:38.800]  quote freemasonry is a fraternity within a fraternity an outer organization concealing an
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:44.240]  inner brotherhood of elect a visible society of splendid camaraderie of free and accepted men
[03:02:44.240 --> 03:02:48.720]  and joined to devote themselves to ethical educational fraternal and patriotic humanitarian
[03:02:48.720 --> 03:02:55.520]  concerns the invisible society is a secret and more august fraternity whose members are dedicated
[03:02:55.520 --> 03:03:02.400]  to the service of a mysterious arcanum arcanorum which means secret of secrets so there manly
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:09.040]  p hall just said that in there is an inner circle of freemasonry he is he is identified as one of
[03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:14.720]  the greatest philosophers of freemasonry and there he says it but yet they'll deny it to you
[03:03:14.720 --> 03:03:22.000]  here manly p hall uh her uh rather rather albert pike another prolific freemasonic author author
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:28.400]  of morals and dogma wrote and again nobody reads these books except high level freemason says quote
[03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:34.080]  masons like all religions he says it's a religion and the mysteries hermeticism and alchemy conceals
[03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:40.720]  its secrets from all except the adepts the stages or the elect and uses false explanations
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:47.040]  and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve to be misled to conceal the
[03:03:47.040 --> 03:03:54.720]  truth which it the mason calls light from them and to draw them away from it so here you have
[03:03:54.720 --> 03:04:00.000]  the freemason's own books which i have this is not bringing light into the world this is hiding
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.560]  light they want to keep the light for themselves and then they want to lie to us and say that there's
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:11.200]  no and that's the fun for patty melt and george w bush is they get to make a big joke out of everything
[03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:16.560]  as they do masonic signs right in front of us all part of the lesser magic rubbing it in the
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:22.000]  little slaves that's right because the inner circle is the continuation of george washington's
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  spy ring and they're good alex and they go to the bohemian grove and you shouldn't bother them
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:30.800]  that's their private resort they need to go there and blow off some steam so you just got the wrong
[03:04:30.800 --> 03:04:36.240]  idea about this whole thing and well when i wanted to talk about the homosexual orgies going on there
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:40.800]  that all even vanity fair admits they did not want to talk about it or want to talk about nixon
[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:44.880]  saying what went on there they did not want to discuss what our christian conservative leaders
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:52.560]  are doing uh but i'm glad that uh you know i hope that uh mr melzer will come on the show we've

[03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:08.080]  did announce that there would be other announced what's coming well now they've added a stop think
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:15.200]  connect you need to not just uh see something say something now stop and start looking around
[03:09:15.200 --> 03:09:20.640]  and spying think and of course this is really meant to make you stop and listen stop and you

[03:09:41.120 --> 03:09:48.160]  tv screen stupid i mean that's the subconscious message to all of this the bigger what i call the
[03:09:48.160 --> 03:09:54.720]  bureaucracy uh playoff of the bureaucracy but this by creating this fervor and this this fear of
[03:09:54.720 --> 03:10:00.240]  oh everyone's out that we need snitches this is going to create such a strain on the police force
[03:10:00.240 --> 03:10:03.840]  that they're going to obviously have to just pump more money into it and get it bigger because when
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:10.160]  we have people calling 911 now because their chicken mcnuggets are cold or the fast food took
[03:10:10.160 --> 03:10:17.920]  too long at the at the burger king just imagine how many fake bogus tips uh 911 and these other
[03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:24.400]  people are going to be getting from these paranoid uh people after meanwhile we didn't need the police
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:29.520]  to tell us uh in Tucson it turns out they're trying to seal it but a lot of it's leaked
[03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:34.400]  they were at his house over and over again he was threatening to kill people on a weekly basis
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:40.000]  which is illegal and nothing was done yeah so they never respond to real crime but the carpet
[03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:46.160]  cleaner or the cable guy they're spying on you yeah and this guy again he's really he shows
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:51.440]  just how desensitized we've become as a culture once some whack job can have almost everybody
[03:10:51.440 --> 03:10:57.360]  he comes into contact with you know former friends co-worker students everybody's saying this guy is
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:11:02.720]  dangerous and and you know nobody does anything so it's because we're so desensitized you turn
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:06.800]  on the tv and you see lunatics killing people stabbing people all the time it doesn't matter
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:11.040]  oh hey here's another one my neighbor's a lunatic too which is people's minds have become so
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:16.720]  desensitized but then when they want us to really connect and humanize it michelle obama gets up and
[03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:21.760]  cries and everybody's got a magically made t-shirt you know the day it happens boom here's the slogan
[03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:26.720]  get him printed bring in maroc the applause for him when he took the stage yesterday i would have
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:32.800]  sworn that he himself had saved some of the some of the victims uh in Tucson it just everybody was
[03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:37.040]  giving him a standing ovation it was incredible thank you so much mr president i won't have to
[03:11:37.040 --> 03:11:42.960]  have a car payment or a house payment remember that two years ago oh he's the messiah i mean
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:50.400]  seeing in he may be like jesus he he's fighting the bankers he uh i got some great ideas about
[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:54.320]  it i've been seeing things so clear and i know that sometimes i'm a big jackass and some of my
[03:11:54.320 --> 03:11:59.360]  youtube videos and i i hope that people you know doesn't take away from my message because i i just
[03:11:59.360 --> 03:12:04.080]  am trying to articulate all this madness when are you a male donkey i think you do a great job mark
[03:12:04.080 --> 03:12:08.000]  okay you know sometimes i'm a little bit of a jackass i'm trying to be a little more straightforward
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:12.560]  now but i'm telling you i got some ideas to really get the word out an effective way i got some big
[03:12:12.560 --> 03:12:17.200]  ideas i'm gonna try we'll we'll keep in contact i'll announce the new book here in another month
[03:12:17.200 --> 03:12:22.160]  or two and i'm gonna try to just really go ramp it up here in 2011 and get the word out man i just
[03:12:22.160 --> 03:12:26.240]  got some big ideas i'm seeing things really clearly now and i want to thank everybody's
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:31.120]  support everybody's encouragement and everybody's contributions too because you know we all learn
[03:12:31.120 --> 03:12:36.800]  from everybody here even even though alex you know we hold him up as an expert alex learns from
[03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:40.880]  from the callers and from the comments on articles and everything too so i want to thank
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:46.720]  everyone really i don't know everything i didn't know that mark hey continuing you know i know
[03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:50.880]  enough to know how much i don't know and that's what scares me by the general public who just
[03:12:50.880 --> 03:12:56.240]  thinks they know it all uh who think they know it all and they don't have any idea now now let's
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:13:00.960]  get back into this illuminati show i've now had a chance to watch some of the episodes are decoded
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:07.120]  and and you can really see how this has george h.w. bush's seal he's involved with the new book
[03:13:07.680 --> 03:13:13.680]  they're involved telling you how great all this is while simultaneously making fun of us and i
[03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:18.240]  noticed in that episode with you you know that it was kind of hokey and they implied that you were
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:24.160]  scared of police sirens and things but then we do learn that indeed it is lucifer talk about that
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:29.040]  yeah they they make fun of me and they they could discount everything that i'm saying and the
[03:13:29.040 --> 03:13:34.080]  conversation that i have is actually just pieced together and edited in a completely wrong order
[03:13:34.080 --> 03:13:40.640]  you can actually hear the sound doesn't make sense if you're attuned to it um they completely
[03:13:40.640 --> 03:13:44.800]  butchered my word they didn't even say that david rockefeller donated the land his family
[03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:51.040]  donated his father donated the land that's not um it is pieced together and and and i had a
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:57.120]  oh so they do stuff like that to make you look like you were wrong the biggest thing was when
[03:13:57.120 --> 03:14:02.720]  the police car siren went off they made it look like we said oh man i let's get out of here it'll
[03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:07.040]  make him a little paranoid that this is completely wrong that's their creative control there's
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:10.960]  nothing i could do about it you found a contract that you know you waive all your rights away but
[03:14:10.960 --> 03:14:18.560]  but this this whole show uh well it it it goes after phony conspiracy theory is like oh did
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:24.080]  john wilkes booth you know really was he really alive did he escape that's an interesting thing
[03:14:24.080 --> 03:14:29.840]  or maybe the maybe the uh you know old soldiers hid some gold uh some of the you know confederate
[03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:35.040]  soldiers hid some gold that's the maybe a conspiracy in tonight's episode about the 2012
[03:14:35.040 --> 03:14:40.080]  but it it's this phony like build it up to knock it down thing and they're just going after some
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:46.720]  of the biggest um i mean really that the most biggest hardcore uh issues are you know i mean
[03:14:46.720 --> 03:14:53.040]  tangibly the bohemian grove the guide stones uh so they're really doing their best to try to
[03:14:53.040 --> 03:14:58.560]  head off you know this information swell that's going on because yeah so kind of the shallow
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:05.200]  neighbor here's you warming about the new world order and they go i saw that brad melzer program
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:11.040]  you're one of those crazy peoples yeah you know they made me say like oh okay well it
[03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:15.200]  is the lucifer but it's a good lucifer has nothing to do with satan they have a statue of liberty
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:20.000]  but they're wrong and and they're wrong about uh i got into some connection i'm gonna throw a couple
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:24.800]  other interesting facts out there for everyone just to to help them put their puzzle together
[03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:30.560]  and have a bigger bigger picture of this the skull and bones the link to the illuminati i made this
[03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:35.360]  clear to them in the show and of course they didn't air it so i'll tell everybody it was one of the
[03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:41.360]  founders of skull and bones uh william huntington russell just before he started the secret
[03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:45.600]  he was trained in germany it's admittedly a germanic death cult yeah he was in germany
[03:15:45.600 --> 03:15:51.440]  studying uh he was over there studying came back and uh miraculously as soon as he returned
[03:15:51.440 --> 03:15:57.360]  from germany where the illuminati was admittedly started around that same time uh he started this
[03:15:57.360 --> 03:16:01.520]  skull and bones society which now is the most powerful secret society admitted in the world
[03:16:01.520 --> 03:16:06.640]  people say it's a fraternity but the post graduate and it's the american chapter of the illuminati
[03:16:06.640 --> 03:16:12.160]  and i mean even alexander robbins book yeah breaks that now not only did william huntington russell
[03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:16.960]  go to germany right around the time of the alumni just after they were disbanded or you know
[03:16:16.960 --> 03:16:21.680]  allegedly disbanded went underground uh so he goes over to germany comes back starts this
[03:16:21.680 --> 03:16:27.440]  secret society with the same structure the same symbols of the same goals it becomes the most
[03:16:27.440 --> 03:16:31.920]  powerful secret society in the world its members are presidents prime minister everything i are
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:40.080]  not prime minister but presidents head of cia judges okay so so now back a few years after
[03:16:40.080 --> 03:16:45.680]  the secret society started people started to get suspicious so in in 1876 a group of students
[03:16:45.680 --> 03:16:50.560]  broke into the headquarters what they called the tomb the windowless building these students
[03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:55.680]  broke in to investigate what the heck's going on here they wrote a newsletter and distributed
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:17:00.880]  it around yield university they called themselves the file in claw group okay they used the file
[03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:04.640]  on a call to break in there and they wrote a newsletter explaining what they found what did
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:10.880]  they find well they found a bunch of occult stuff uh human skulls the same same language
[03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:17.520]  same rituals as uh the original illuminati were uh these rituals that they were involved in which
[03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:23.200]  was written in john robison's book proofs of a conspiracy they found a plaque on the wall
[03:17:23.200 --> 03:17:29.760]  in the tomb that said to you know uh to the american branch from your german brothers
[03:17:30.800 --> 03:17:35.360]  and what did helmut schmitt german chancellor saying his book men and powers a political
[03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:41.440]  retrospect he said we have our tombs we have our groves in germany but my favorite place to
[03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:47.280]  carry out illuminati rituals is bohemian grove which is a branch of it so you have this top
[03:17:47.280 --> 03:17:54.080]  skull and bones member top bohemian grove member best buds with uh melzer and then we get to be
[03:17:54.080 --> 03:18:01.920]  making fun of when this guy's making illuminati hand signs on you know the cover of uh usa today
[03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:07.840]  and writing the book and dedicating it and thanking this illuminati chieftain uh for the help
[03:18:07.840 --> 03:18:13.600]  i mean it doesn't get any more ridiculous and transparent but they believe we're profane
[03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:18.240]  and so they believe the public is too stupid to see them doing this in front of us which
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:23.440]  is part of the lesser magic or the counting of coup that they do it in front of us so that gives
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:30.080]  them more power because we use this this knowledge our our enlightenment our awareness to help not
[03:18:30.080 --> 03:18:34.720]  only ourselves but to help others they're not the code of humanity that we want the light out in
[03:18:34.720 --> 03:18:39.760]  the open not hoarding it yeah that's why they hate us because we are not keeping it to ourselves
[03:18:39.760 --> 03:18:45.200]  when and then participating in the secretive network of other enlightened brothers to only
[03:18:45.200 --> 03:18:49.360]  benefit those that are in the know and to take advantage of the sheep that's right we're taking
[03:18:49.360 --> 03:18:54.400]  the torch and we're lighting billions of other torches and they can't stand it because that will
[03:18:54.400 --> 03:19:01.520]  bring real light not secret occult hidden light yep well you know we're the ones that are i don't
[03:19:01.520 --> 03:19:04.720]  want to use the term the illuminati because it just means enlightened but we're the enlightened
[03:19:04.720 --> 03:19:09.040]  ones this audience is the enlightened ones we are the ones that are enlightened we we use the
[03:19:09.040 --> 03:19:14.720]  knowledge that we have to love each other to benefit society to enjoy life to say no to torture
[03:19:14.720 --> 03:19:20.240]  that's nothing look at the fruits of this illuminati run society tortures good abortion death
[03:19:20.240 --> 03:19:25.760]  destruction look at what the shooter was into he was one of their enlightened ones he took on
[03:19:25.760 --> 03:19:31.920]  their trappings no we're the opposite and we say we rebuke you we will have nothing to do with you
[03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:37.360]  and you will fail the energy and the strength of humanity and god's true light not lucifer's
