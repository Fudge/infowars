[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  At the end of January 2023, talks between Turkish President Erdogan and the Swedish government
[00:14.240 --> 00:15.240]  detonated.
[00:15.240 --> 00:21.360]  So you will let Teba organizations run wild on your avenues and streets and then expect
[00:21.360 --> 00:24.040]  our support for getting into NATO?
[00:24.040 --> 00:27.000]  That's not happening.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.640]  In order to be accepted into NATO, Sweden and Finland as well needed the vote from
[00:33.640 --> 00:34.640]  Turkey.
[00:34.640 --> 00:40.920]  But talks disintegrated after a Swedish-Danish politician set fire to the Koran in front
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.400]  of the Turkish embassy in Stockholm.
[00:43.400 --> 00:50.240]  On Saturday, Rasmus Paludin, head of a far-right Danish party, held a protest in front of Turkey's
[00:50.240 --> 00:52.640]  embassy in Stockholm.
[00:52.640 --> 00:56.520]  The Swedish-Danish national set fire to the Koran.
[00:56.520 --> 00:59.600]  That has put Sweden's NATO application in jeopardy.
[00:59.600 --> 01:06.400]  A session to the military alliance must be approved unanimously by member states, including
[01:06.400 --> 01:07.400]  Turkey.
[01:07.400 --> 01:14.520]  After Erdogan's declaration, Turkey and northern Syria were devastated by a series of earthquakes
[01:14.520 --> 01:21.000]  in southern Turkey, with a death toll that has reached well over 11,000 people.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.720]  We are finished, my God.
[01:22.720 --> 01:25.640]  There is nobody here, nobody.
[01:25.640 --> 01:27.320]  What kind of state is this?
[01:27.320 --> 01:29.880]  Turkey is no stranger to earthquakes.
[01:29.880 --> 01:35.120]  The majority of them occurring in the eastern and western portions of the country.
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.760]  But strange anomalies occurred just before the earthquakes, leading many to question
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.920]  whether a harp weapon may have been used to punish the Turkish government for failing
[01:46.920 --> 02:03.000]  to tow the line of NATO's new world order overlords.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.040]  We've had a few guests on talking about what they believe harp does, what they admit it
[02:07.040 --> 02:08.040]  does.
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.040]  You know, why not?
[02:09.040 --> 02:19.880]  Well, in terms of what it is, it's a research facility to conduct research on spear and
[02:19.880 --> 02:20.880]  radio spires.
[02:20.880 --> 02:24.880]  What about other countries, the Russians, the Chinese, the European Union, do they have
[02:24.880 --> 02:26.880]  similar programs, doctor?
[02:26.880 --> 02:33.520]  The European community has a facility in the TromsÃ¸-Norway, what they call the ice
[02:33.520 --> 02:41.560]  gas community there, that actually was a facility like harp that's been around a lot longer
[02:41.560 --> 02:42.560]  than harp.
[02:42.560 --> 02:48.400]  The Smithsonian is reporting, and the Daily Mail is reporting, and a bunch of other publications
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.400]  are reporting.
[02:49.400 --> 02:56.640]  China and Russia are working together to heat the atmosphere for weather control using large
[02:56.640 --> 03:02.880]  antenna arrays on the ground directed by satellites in space.
[03:02.880 --> 03:06.320]  This is weather modification on a global scale.
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.840]  In fact, these programs are so large and so all-encompassing that all other weather modification
[03:11.840 --> 03:18.000]  programs that go on on a smaller regional basis are virtually, they're negated by the
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  scope and scale of the global geo-engineering programs.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.560]  The saturation, which ionizes the atmosphere, makes the atmosphere more conductive.
[03:24.560 --> 03:30.280]  We have the harp facilities, high-frequency, active auroral research program.
[03:30.280 --> 03:34.280]  These are ionosphere heaters, many have heard of the harp facilities.
[03:34.280 --> 03:39.160]  There's not just one or two or three, we believe there's at least 18 around the globe, possibly
[03:39.160 --> 03:41.840]  there are three more being built in Antarctica right now.
[03:41.840 --> 03:44.760]  We were able to identify each frequency.
[03:44.760 --> 03:49.040]  We accomplished this with just 30 watts of radio power.
[03:49.040 --> 03:55.640]  If you do this with a billion watts, the vibrations are so violent that the entire piano would
[03:55.640 --> 03:56.640]  shake.
[03:56.640 --> 03:58.360]  In fact, the whole house would shake.
[03:58.360 --> 04:04.240]  In fact, the vibrations could be so severe underground that it could even cause an earthquake.
[04:04.240 --> 04:10.560]  These weapons of geopolitical terrorism will be able to mold the climate change narrative
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.600]  and bend countries to the will of the New World Order as the target date of UN Agenda
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.280]  2030 draws nigh.
[04:19.280 --> 04:26.640]  In short, the New World Order is a weapon system, a planetary terraforming operation,
[04:26.640 --> 04:31.720]  genetically changing the planet's genetic makeup, changing the atmospheres makeup, changing
[04:31.720 --> 04:37.640]  the tectonic activity of the planet, changing the oceans, changing all life, changing the
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.800]  radiological background, changing the magnetic background.
[04:41.800 --> 05:08.800]  Every observation we see shows this modern system is doing one thing, killing us.
[05:08.800 --> 05:15.800]  It's really just incredible.
[05:15.800 --> 05:33.320]  So, for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support, and I
[05:33.320 --> 05:42.160]  only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[05:42.160 --> 05:43.160]  us.
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.160]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[05:44.160 --> 05:47.200]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great
[05:47.200 --> 05:50.680]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[05:50.680 --> 05:55.480]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[05:55.480 --> 05:59.560]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com, our funding problems
[05:59.560 --> 06:00.560]  will be over.
[06:00.560 --> 06:07.560]  Let's take action now.
[06:07.560 --> 06:11.560]  It's Thursday, February 9th, 2023, and the false flag attack on the North Street by
[06:11.560 --> 06:37.560]  the United States of America is shaking the world by itself.

[31:59.560 --> 32:07.560]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[32:07.560 --> 32:10.560]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[32:10.560 --> 32:14.560]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[32:14.560 --> 32:17.560]  Alex has been right on port over a decade.
[32:17.560 --> 32:23.560]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[32:23.560 --> 32:31.560]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[32:31.560 --> 32:35.560]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[32:35.560 --> 32:38.560]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[32:38.560 --> 32:41.560]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[32:41.560 --> 32:44.560]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[32:44.560 --> 32:47.560]  The government, ears, Alex Jones.
[32:47.560 --> 32:52.560]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[32:52.560 --> 32:57.560]  AlexJonesLive.com
[33:22.560 --> 33:44.560]  It's sabotage and incredibly dangerous.
[33:44.560 --> 33:52.560]  All right, the Russians, about a month after the globalists that run our country blew up the Nord Stream Pipelines,
[33:52.560 --> 33:58.560]  playing your what happens gas to heat their homes and cook their food and run a lot of their vehicles,
[33:58.560 --> 34:04.560]  said they intercepted transmissions to a third party country in Europe that had detonated the weapon.
[34:04.560 --> 34:08.560]  And now that's what Syhurst says he has from CIA high-level contacts.
[34:08.560 --> 34:10.560]  That's exactly how they do it.
[34:10.560 --> 34:14.560]  The CIA runs it, the Navy plants the bombs, they wait a few months,
[34:14.560 --> 34:19.560]  and then they have a third party country that doesn't know what their bully is going to trigger,
[34:19.560 --> 34:25.560]  but they say send this pulse frequency out through the sea.
[34:25.560 --> 34:31.560]  And then the explosion happens and there's all these different levels of denial.
[34:31.560 --> 34:33.560]  And that's exactly how they do it.
[34:33.560 --> 34:35.560]  It's like the Kennedy assassination.
[34:35.560 --> 34:42.560]  They had famous hitmen from Europe there, mafia hitmen, army snipers, Marine Corps snipers,
[34:42.560 --> 34:51.560]  and they had E. Howard Hunt, their quarterback in the whole operation.
[34:51.560 --> 34:54.560]  He later gave a deathbed confession.
[34:54.560 --> 35:01.560]  So it's pretty clear what's going on here and extremely, extremely dangerous.
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.560]  You've got to go to infowars.com and read Syhurst's report.
[35:05.560 --> 35:09.560]  It's linked under the live show feed of the broadcast today,
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.560]  but this really is a, quote, U.S. false flag because they tried to blame it on Russia.
[35:15.560 --> 35:19.560]  Nord Stream sabotaged with CIA U.S. Navy covert op.
[35:19.560 --> 35:22.560]  Seymour Hirsch bombshell prompts White House response.
[35:22.560 --> 35:25.560]  Fame journalist, Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hirsch.
[35:25.560 --> 35:31.560]  Who for decades was a star reporter writing for the New York Times and the New Yorker on Wednesday,
[35:31.560 --> 35:36.560]  published a new bombshell at his substack post prompting a quick White House response.
[35:36.560 --> 35:41.560]  After conducting his own investigation and sabotaged the Nord Stream pipeline,
[35:41.560 --> 35:44.560]  via series of underwater blasts on September 26,
[35:44.560 --> 35:50.560]  Hirsch, included the United States, blew up the Russia to Germany natural gas pipeline
[35:50.560 --> 35:58.560]  as part of a covert operation under the guise of a NATO exercise, BALTOP's 22 NATO.
[35:58.560 --> 36:03.560]  Hirsch, relying on unnamed national security sources, describes months of discussions
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.560]  and back and forth involving the Biden White House, CIA Pentagon, reports his planning
[36:08.560 --> 36:12.560]  was in the works all the way back to December of 2021.
[36:12.560 --> 36:17.560]  Remember, Biden said before the war even started, if he invades, we'll blow it up.
[36:17.560 --> 36:25.560]  With a special task force formed under the agents of the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.
[36:25.560 --> 36:36.560]  And again, Biden's big dementia brain had to brag about it repeatedly.
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.560]  The Navy proposed using a newly commissioned submarine to assault the pipeline directly.
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.560]  The Air Force discussed dropping bombs with delayed fuses that could set off remotely.
[36:47.560 --> 36:52.560]  The CIA argued that whatever was done, it would have to be done covertly.
[36:52.560 --> 36:55.560]  Everyone involved understood the stakes, the report entitled
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.560]  How America Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline Reads.
[36:57.560 --> 37:01.560]  The Biden administration was doing everything possible to avoid leaks
[37:01.560 --> 37:07.560]  as the planning took place late in 2021 and into the first months of 2022, it continues.
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.560]  But they warned the European allies, and so that's how they got the information.
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.560]  The Russians, as momentum gained to proceed with the covert sabotage attack,
[37:17.560 --> 37:23.560]  over the next few weeks, members of the CIA's working group began to craft a plan for covert operations,
[37:23.560 --> 37:26.560]  which didn't include Biden saying they were going to blow it up,
[37:26.560 --> 37:33.560]  that would use deep-sea divers to trigger an explosion along the pipeline, Hearst writes.
[37:33.560 --> 37:38.560]  There was significant pushback with the intelligence community, but any reservations were overcome
[37:38.560 --> 37:42.560]  in the lead-up to the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.560]  according to investigative report. Then it goes into Hearst's sources.
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.560]  Throughout all the scheming, the source said, some working guys in the CIA, the State Department were saying,
[37:52.560 --> 37:57.560]  don't do this, it's stupid, and will be a political nightmare if it comes out,
[37:57.560 --> 38:01.560]  which it's coming out because he bragged about it before he did it.
[38:01.560 --> 38:06.560]  Nevertheless, everybody said, yeah, they caught my son in bribery, the prosecutor did.
[38:06.560 --> 38:10.560]  So I said, we'll take a billion dollars from you if he's not fired by tonight,
[38:10.560 --> 38:13.560]  and son of a bitch, he was fired an hour later.
[38:13.560 --> 38:17.560]  That pipeline, we're going to get rid of that pipeline, it won't be there, don't worry.
[38:17.560 --> 38:21.560]  It's going to go bye-bye, okay.
[38:21.560 --> 38:26.560]  Nevertheless, in early 2022, the CIA working group reported back to Settlement's interagency group.
[38:26.560 --> 38:31.560]  We have a way to blow up the pipeline. Hersh has the documents just so you know.
[38:31.560 --> 38:34.560]  Just like me lying, he's going to let them lie about it.
[38:34.560 --> 38:38.560]  Like the White House, so this is preposterous, conspiracy theory. He's got the documents.
[38:38.560 --> 38:42.560]  And he's going to release those. See how that works?
[38:42.560 --> 38:48.560]  And obviously, Cy Hersh is super high into the U.S. intelligence system.
[38:48.560 --> 38:53.560]  There's different factions, and there's certain factions that don't want World War III,
[38:53.560 --> 38:57.560]  and like living, and like having kids and grandkids and playing golf and going to church
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.560]  and going out to eat and stuff like going for hikes and don't want to die.
[39:03.560 --> 39:07.560]  And so that's what this is. This is the more sane parts of our government saying,
[39:07.560 --> 39:10.560]  just like Elon Musk is super high level spook.
[39:10.560 --> 39:14.560]  There's large groups in the government that are like, this needs to stop now.
[39:14.560 --> 39:20.560]  This is insane. And so that's why this is all coming up.
[39:20.560 --> 39:25.560]  Nevertheless, in early 2022, a CIA working group reported back to Sullivan's interagency group,
[39:25.560 --> 39:27.560]  we have a way to blow up the pipeline.
[39:27.560 --> 39:31.560]  What came next was a stunning, on January 7th, less than three weeks before,
[39:31.560 --> 39:34.560]  the seemingly inevitable Russian invasion of Ukraine,
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.560]  Biden met in the White House office with German Chancellor,
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.560]  who after some wobbling, was now firmly on the American team.
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.560]  But the press briefing that followed Biden defiantly said,
[39:47.560 --> 39:51.560]  if Russia invades, there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[39:51.560 --> 39:54.560]  We will bring it to an end.
[39:54.560 --> 39:57.560]  We'll see the video. Everybody's seeing them. I'm going to play it again.
[39:57.560 --> 40:03.560]  20 days earlier, Undersecretary Newland had delivered essentially the same message
[40:03.560 --> 40:06.560]  at a State Department briefing with little press coverage.
[40:06.560 --> 40:08.560]  We played that clip too. In fact, I forgot that clip. Get that.
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.560]  I want to be very clear to you today, she said in response to the question,
[40:13.560 --> 40:21.560]  if Russia invades Ukraine one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[40:21.560 --> 40:25.560]  And then they got the nerve to deny they did it.
[40:25.560 --> 40:28.560]  And it goes on from there, how they blew it up,
[40:28.560 --> 40:34.560]  riveting information in an extremely real world and totally dangerous.
[40:34.560 --> 40:37.560]  So let's talk about this.
[40:37.560 --> 40:45.560]  This will have the United States and NATO lose the moral high ground.
[40:45.560 --> 40:50.560]  It'll give all the Germans and others that are paying up to nine times
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.560]  what they were for energy just a few years ago.
[40:53.560 --> 40:58.560]  The political spark to get together and say no to all of this.
[40:58.560 --> 41:01.560]  And then it's just Joe Biden and all of them lying to everybody.
[41:01.560 --> 41:03.560]  It's just a further credibility drop.
[41:03.560 --> 41:12.560]  And it gives Russia a lot of gas for their new second invasion
[41:12.560 --> 41:16.560]  or their battle of the bulls they're trying to set up right now.
[41:16.560 --> 41:19.560]  And so this is just crazy.
[41:19.560 --> 41:23.560]  But Biden and the globalists love to cut off civilian infrastructure.
[41:23.560 --> 41:25.560]  They love to cut off pipelines.
[41:25.560 --> 41:27.560]  They love to collapse countries.
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.560]  They love to steal pension funds.
[41:29.560 --> 41:31.560]  They love to squeeze little guys.
[41:31.560 --> 41:35.560]  And so they just couldn't help themselves blowing up some infrastructure.
[41:35.560 --> 41:38.560]  It's just too delicious to do.
[41:38.560 --> 41:41.560]  They couldn't have the Ukrainians shoot some missiles.
[41:41.560 --> 41:43.560]  They're at the coastline of Russia.
[41:43.560 --> 41:47.560]  Give Russia invaded and hit the pipeline where it goes into the ocean
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.560]  and say, well, we hit Russia, we hit the pipeline.
[41:49.560 --> 41:51.560]  No, no, they couldn't have you that direct.
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.560]  Instead, they had to do it covertly and they had to lie about it,
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.560]  even though there was no way to ever contain that they did this.
[41:58.560 --> 42:01.560]  In day one, we hadn't just figured it out.
[42:01.560 --> 42:03.560]  Everybody else had figured it out.
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.560]  They were over it for a couple weeks with Navy ships
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.560]  that delivered deep water Navy SEAL submarines.
[42:13.560 --> 42:16.560]  I mean, they had a construction job going on there.
[42:16.560 --> 42:19.560]  They were planting bombs all over the place to make sure
[42:19.560 --> 42:22.560]  that the Russians couldn't just pull up with a repair ship and fix one section.
[42:22.560 --> 42:26.560]  They blew holes all over it like Swiss cheese.
[42:26.560 --> 42:32.560]  And so now it's all out in the open that the United States
[42:32.560 --> 42:34.560]  conducted this act of war against Russia.
[42:34.560 --> 42:39.560]  And we'll talk about the rest of the story when we return on the other side
[42:39.560 --> 42:44.560]  as Russia prepares to invade with a whole new army.
[42:44.560 --> 42:46.560]  In fact, I don't think they'll attack the 24th.
[42:46.560 --> 42:51.560]  If I had to put on my Karnak hat, I would say the Russians invade
[42:51.560 --> 42:55.560]  with their new 500,000-man army with several thousand tanks
[42:55.560 --> 42:59.560]  in eight days.
[42:59.560 --> 43:01.560]  Well, I have fantastic stuff.
[43:01.560 --> 43:04.560]  Diet Force is amazing.
[43:04.560 --> 43:06.560]  I'm 45, and I have bits.
[43:06.560 --> 43:09.560]  I go to the gym, and I have bits that won't move.
[43:09.560 --> 43:13.560]  And Diet Force has helped me move those bits.
[43:13.560 --> 43:18.560]  Under my packs, my belly, I'm just taking Diet Force two tablets a day.
[43:18.560 --> 43:24.560]  Man, if you're struggling to get chip shapes for the ladies,
[43:24.560 --> 43:27.560]  mate, Diet Force is the go.
[43:27.560 --> 43:31.560]  You have to get to Diet Force and have two a day, and just keep active.
[43:31.560 --> 43:34.560]  Infowarsstore.com, X7 Diet Force.

[43:46.560 --> 43:47.560]  Don't go anywhere.

[43:59.560 --> 44:02.560]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones,
[44:02.560 --> 44:06.560]  needs to support Infowars and band.video.
[44:06.560 --> 44:08.560]  The Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[44:08.560 --> 44:09.560]  I'm going to do that right now.
[44:09.560 --> 44:13.560]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[44:13.560 --> 44:17.560]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start,
[44:17.560 --> 44:19.560]  like Savannah Hernandez.
[44:19.560 --> 44:22.560]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space
[44:22.560 --> 44:24.560]  because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[44:24.560 --> 44:27.560]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man
[44:27.560 --> 44:30.560]  and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be
[44:30.560 --> 44:33.560]  half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[44:33.560 --> 44:36.560]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[44:36.560 --> 44:39.560]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[44:39.560 --> 44:42.560]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones
[44:42.560 --> 44:46.560]  and band.video for granted, because you don't know what you have
[44:46.560 --> 44:47.560]  until it's gone.
[44:47.560 --> 44:50.560]  We need to support free speech systems right now,
[44:50.560 --> 44:51.560]  so go check out the store.

[44:54.560 --> 44:55.560]  Leave a donation right now.
[44:55.560 --> 44:57.560]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[44:59.560 --> 45:01.560]  Infowars is winning.
[45:01.560 --> 45:03.560]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[45:03.560 --> 45:06.560]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[45:06.560 --> 45:08.560]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[45:08.560 --> 45:11.560]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[45:11.560 --> 45:13.560]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[45:13.560 --> 45:14.560]  None of that's true.
[45:14.560 --> 45:15.560]  It's all being appealed.
[45:15.560 --> 45:17.560]  They want you to think Infowars is dead.
[45:17.560 --> 45:20.560]  But if you simply stand up and support Infowars,
[45:20.560 --> 45:22.560]  we've got years and years of appeals,
[45:22.560 --> 45:24.560]  and we will not be taken off the air.
[45:24.560 --> 45:26.560]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down,
[45:26.560 --> 45:27.560]  they're going to win.
[45:27.560 --> 45:30.560]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.

[46:11.560 --> 46:15.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.

[46:19.560 --> 46:22.560]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks
[46:22.560 --> 46:24.560]  on every front, but I'm not going to back down,
[46:24.560 --> 46:26.560]  and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[46:26.560 --> 46:28.560]  So please keep me on the field.

[46:52.560 --> 47:11.560]  The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[47:22.560 --> 47:37.560]  All right, at the end of this segment,
[47:37.560 --> 47:39.560]  I'm going to give the number out,
[47:39.560 --> 47:41.560]  and I'm going to take your phone call
[47:41.560 --> 47:43.560]  on the Nord Stream Pipeline Destruction,
[47:43.560 --> 47:46.560]  Syhurst Report, that we know is true.
[47:46.560 --> 47:48.560]  He has the sources.
[47:48.560 --> 47:52.560]  He's broken of the 10 biggest stories
[47:52.560 --> 47:55.560]  in the last 55, 60 years.
[47:55.560 --> 47:57.560]  He's broken like eight of them,
[47:57.560 --> 47:59.560]  and it's always been true what he says.
[47:59.560 --> 48:01.560]  It's why it took him months and months and months
[48:01.560 --> 48:03.560]  to put this report out.
[48:03.560 --> 48:05.560]  He's got the sources that were pissed off about this,
[48:05.560 --> 48:07.560]  and think the American people, you know,
[48:07.560 --> 48:09.560]  that your government's running around
[48:09.560 --> 48:11.560]  blowing up civilian gas pipelines
[48:11.560 --> 48:13.560]  and supply half of Europe and then lying about it.
[48:13.560 --> 48:15.560]  And that's the separation of powers.
[48:15.560 --> 48:17.560]  That's what we need. We need those watchdogs.
[48:17.560 --> 48:19.560]  We need those checks.
[48:19.560 --> 48:21.560]  And we have some good people still in our government
[48:21.560 --> 48:23.560]  and still in our corporations.
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.560]  That's why the world hasn't ended yet.
[48:25.560 --> 48:27.560]  It still may.
[48:27.560 --> 48:29.560]  So we're going to talk more about that.
[48:29.560 --> 48:31.560]  Let me talk about this first.
[48:31.560 --> 48:33.560]  I try to bring you high-end quality products
[48:33.560 --> 48:35.560]  that are very low-priced for what you're getting,
[48:35.560 --> 48:37.560]  so you get a great result,
[48:37.560 --> 48:39.560]  so you want to come back and get them over and over again.
[48:39.560 --> 48:41.560]  I want a relationship with you.
[48:41.560 --> 48:43.560]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[48:43.560 --> 48:45.560]  So anything we sell, anything we promote,
[48:45.560 --> 48:47.560]  anything you do, anything you don't,
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.560]  you can propose a great deal of example,
[48:49.560 --> 48:51.560]  yes, we can build a family and then accept it,
[48:51.560 --> 48:53.560]  as you've seen, but we do all these things.
[48:53.560 --> 49:13.560]  So one of our yards- familiar ones is
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.680]  your 1,000 milligram bottle in stores and online,
[49:16.680 --> 49:19.560]  how are you selling it for 60 something dollars?
[49:19.560 --> 49:24.360]  Well, we don't mark it up 300%.
[49:24.360 --> 49:27.600]  And we mark it up 100%, or a little over 100%.
[49:27.600 --> 49:30.320]  And I figure that's a great deal for you.
[49:30.320 --> 49:35.200]  So yes, we can sell this for $150 all day long.
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.280]  And people actually, a lot of marketers have told me,
[49:37.280 --> 49:38.120]  why don't you do that?
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.080]  They would respect it more and think it's better
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.200]  if it has a high price tag.
[49:41.200 --> 49:43.200]  And a certain group of the public is like that.
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.520]  I just don't buy into that.
[49:44.520 --> 49:48.160]  I'll buy generic if I know it's made at the very same lab,
[49:48.160 --> 49:51.000]  whether it's Aspirin or Advil or anything.
[49:51.000 --> 49:52.440]  So why would you not buy?
[49:52.440 --> 49:54.800]  It's not generic with us, it's private label by us.
[49:54.800 --> 49:57.760]  The exact same, one of the top national best sellers
[49:59.040 --> 50:02.400]  sold all over the place for $159 a bottle
[50:02.400 --> 50:05.680]  and then they discount it down to 110 or 100.
[50:05.680 --> 50:07.040]  That's a marketing tactic, you know,
[50:07.040 --> 50:09.280]  have the full price and then cut it back.
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.720]  Well, we've got it for 60 something bucks,
[50:11.720 --> 50:15.320]  $67 and our regular would be 89.
[50:15.320 --> 50:17.120]  That's still an insane price.
[50:17.120 --> 50:21.000]  Your savings $22 on full spectrum 1000 milligram CBD.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.840]  No THC doesn't get you high,
[50:22.840 --> 50:23.960]  does incredible things for your joints,
[50:23.960 --> 50:26.040]  your bones, your brain, everything.
[50:26.040 --> 50:27.880]  And a lot of folks can't handle it when it's that strong.
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.840]  I'd be careful with it.
[50:29.840 --> 50:33.120]  We have full spectrum CBD 25 milligram gummies
[50:33.120 --> 50:37.680]  and the 10 milligram gummies are back in stock
[50:37.680 --> 50:38.960]  because a bunch of this had sold out
[50:38.960 --> 50:40.280]  but they got more back in stock.
[50:40.280 --> 50:45.280]  Get yours discounted right now at infowarstore.com.
[50:48.400 --> 50:50.960]  Here's Mike Adams about a month ago talking about it.
[50:54.680 --> 50:58.760]  So I had a distant relative suffering from seizures
[50:58.760 --> 51:02.480]  and they called me and asked me, what should we get?
[51:02.480 --> 51:05.320]  And I said, look, you should try CBD
[51:05.320 --> 51:08.840]  because the CBD A has this effect with people.
[51:08.840 --> 51:11.120]  And anti-seizure effects.
[51:11.120 --> 51:12.160]  And I said, you got to try this.
[51:12.160 --> 51:17.160]  So I bought on your store two vials of your CBD 1000 milligrams.
[51:17.800 --> 51:20.600]  I couldn't believe the price that you had.
[51:20.600 --> 51:22.000]  It was so low.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.640]  I mean, the value of that.
[51:23.640 --> 51:27.840]  If people know this industry, the price is very, very good.
[51:27.840 --> 51:29.880]  I sent a bottle to my family member.
[51:29.880 --> 51:31.560]  I kept the bottle for myself.
[51:31.560 --> 51:34.200]  And then my family member was using it,
[51:34.200 --> 51:35.640]  having amazing results.
[51:35.640 --> 51:39.240]  I sent the bottle, well, my lab director was working
[51:39.240 --> 51:43.200]  on a new method to quantitate cannabinoids,
[51:43.200 --> 51:46.440]  about 10 or 12 of them using a single four minute method
[51:46.440 --> 51:48.920]  on an LCMS instrument, a mass spec instrument.
[51:48.920 --> 51:52.160]  And she asked me, hey, do you have a sample of CBD oil
[51:52.160 --> 51:53.640]  that we can test on this method?
[51:53.640 --> 51:55.240]  And I said, okay, sure.
[51:55.240 --> 51:57.560]  So I gave her a sample blind.
[51:57.560 --> 52:00.520]  She didn't know it was Infowars or any brand or anything.
[52:00.520 --> 52:01.880]  Gave it to her blind.
[52:01.880 --> 52:03.720]  She ran the sample, got the results.
[52:03.720 --> 52:05.200]  And wow, this is a full profile.
[52:05.200 --> 52:06.240]  It's a full spectrum.
[52:06.240 --> 52:07.360]  It's got CBD in it.
[52:07.360 --> 52:09.120]  I said, yeah, of course it does.
[52:09.120 --> 52:10.160]  It's got CBD.
[52:10.160 --> 52:12.600]  And it's super, super low THC.
[52:12.600 --> 52:15.080]  We have tests for Delta 9 and all that stuff.
[52:15.080 --> 52:17.000]  And I asked her, I said, okay,
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.760]  you've tested about 100 CBD products.
[52:19.760 --> 52:22.520]  What do you think this product would cost in the marketplace?
[52:22.520 --> 52:26.720]  Just looking at the lab results, she said $150.
[52:26.720 --> 52:29.240]  You know, in the same volume that you have.
[52:29.240 --> 52:30.680]  I just looked at your store.
[52:30.680 --> 52:35.400]  This is I think $67 or $68 on Infowars store.
[52:36.280 --> 52:37.200]  No joke, Alex.
[52:37.200 --> 52:39.680]  And you didn't ask me to talk about this,
[52:39.680 --> 52:42.360]  but I got to tell you just independently,
[52:42.360 --> 52:45.440]  this CBD product that you have is an outstanding value.
[52:45.440 --> 52:46.280]  It's outstanding.
[52:46.280 --> 52:48.520]  I'm taking it myself and it's helping my family members.
[52:48.520 --> 52:50.080]  So I just want to put that on the record.
[52:50.080 --> 52:50.920]  It's the real deal.
[52:50.920 --> 52:52.280]  Well, I appreciate that.
[52:52.280 --> 52:53.120]  I didn't know that happened.
[52:53.120 --> 52:56.440]  I mean, here's all that happened with the Infowars MD line.
[52:56.440 --> 52:57.920]  We went out looking for new suppliers
[52:57.920 --> 52:59.640]  because we were getting blocked everywhere
[52:59.640 --> 53:00.960]  and having issues getting the stuff we wanted,
[53:00.960 --> 53:02.440]  as you know, with supply chain breakdowns.
[53:02.440 --> 53:04.720]  We ran into two big companies that are listeners.
[53:04.720 --> 53:06.120]  And this particular company said,
[53:06.120 --> 53:07.280]  we have over 50 products.
[53:07.280 --> 53:09.120]  Most of them are already top sellers.
[53:09.120 --> 53:10.800]  And I said, well, what do you think your best products are?
[53:10.800 --> 53:12.800]  They said, well, this is wide spectrum CBD
[53:12.800 --> 53:14.800]  that we sell under a couple of different names in stores
[53:14.800 --> 53:18.440]  and at medical clinics for about $120 to $150.
[53:18.440 --> 53:20.320]  We recommend you sell it for 100
[53:20.320 --> 53:22.600]  and we got to buy it for like 30.
[53:22.600 --> 53:26.000]  And I just said, no, we're going to double our monies enough.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.280]  So yes, this is $100 to $120,
[53:28.280 --> 53:30.680]  especially the 1,000 milligram one, CBD,
[53:30.680 --> 53:31.760]  or about half the price.
[53:31.760 --> 53:33.000]  And so you nailed it.
[53:33.000 --> 53:33.840]  Absolutely.
[53:33.840 --> 53:35.440]  Because I'm not a big top tester like you.
[53:35.440 --> 53:37.280]  I just go out and say, what's top rated?
[53:37.280 --> 53:38.680]  Who's already got the best test?
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.520]  Who is that?
[53:39.520 --> 53:40.840]  And then that way we know it's already built in
[53:40.840 --> 53:41.680]  that it's quality.
[53:41.680 --> 53:42.720]  So thank you for the support.
[53:42.720 --> 53:44.280]  It has to be processed correctly.
[53:44.280 --> 53:46.200]  And whoever you're using as your source,
[53:46.200 --> 53:47.960]  they know how to do that to maintain it.
[53:47.960 --> 53:50.440]  So it keeps all those molecules in their form.
[53:50.440 --> 53:54.080]  CBD is very delicate and it can be destroyed through heat.
[53:55.040 --> 53:56.440]  By the way, I hadn't watched that clip
[53:56.440 --> 53:57.640]  till he said it live on the show.
[53:57.640 --> 53:58.920]  So I wasn't trying to contradict him.
[53:58.920 --> 54:00.000]  He was back at the studio last week
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.800]  and told me he was close relative.
[54:01.800 --> 54:02.720]  So I get it.
[54:02.720 --> 54:04.440]  My family gets mad when I talk about them.
[54:04.440 --> 54:05.960]  Real mad sometimes.
[54:05.960 --> 54:08.200]  So he was like, oh, it's a distant relative
[54:08.200 --> 54:09.240]  and it's a little bit closer, I think,
[54:09.240 --> 54:11.680]  but I didn't mean to do that.
[54:11.680 --> 54:14.440]  So the point is, is it really is good?
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.960]  Like I was looking at this company and they go,
[54:15.960 --> 54:18.960]  we got the best turmeric 95, you're humanoid.
[54:18.960 --> 54:19.800]  And I said, really?
[54:19.800 --> 54:22.200]  And then I found out we were buying it from them
[54:22.200 --> 54:23.600]  for body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[54:23.600 --> 54:25.000]  So it's basically the same pill.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.120]  Our formula is a little bit different with bodies.
[54:27.120 --> 54:29.000]  They added a few different things that weren't in it.
[54:29.000 --> 54:30.480]  But it's apples and oranges.
[54:30.480 --> 54:32.560]  It's amazing.
[54:32.560 --> 54:33.560]  So there's that.
[54:33.560 --> 54:36.000]  There's nitric mousse that Dr. Mikovic said.
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.200]  She looked at our formula, says it's really great.
[54:38.200 --> 54:39.920]  It's already a top seller out there.
[54:39.920 --> 54:41.480]  So go to infowarstore.com.
[54:41.480 --> 54:42.520]  That's what keeps us on air,
[54:42.520 --> 54:45.920]  but these are things you really need.
[54:45.920 --> 54:49.000]  And then we have what's really bodybuilding formulas.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.920]  I haven't really gotten to the sports enhancement area,
[54:50.920 --> 54:51.920]  but we have another big company.
[54:51.920 --> 54:53.400]  It's a pharmaceutical company that also makes them
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.240]  the tops of most of the country.
[54:54.240 --> 54:55.880]  And I said, what's your best sellers?
[54:55.880 --> 55:00.800]  They said 1776 testosterone boost and pain MD.
[55:00.800 --> 55:02.520]  We're out of the HGH max boost.
[55:02.520 --> 55:03.680]  We're trying to get some more.
[55:03.680 --> 55:04.520]  People wanted that.
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.360]  That's what everybody bought.
[55:05.360 --> 55:06.360]  But these are just as good.
[55:06.360 --> 55:09.000]  Natural, amazing, powerful compounds for pain relief,
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.720]  pain MD, infowarstore.com.
[55:11.720 --> 55:16.000]  And 1776 testosterone boost, which again is natural
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.240]  and helps to free the testosterone in your body,
[55:18.240 --> 55:19.080]  helps carry it through your body.
[55:19.080 --> 55:21.480]  It's got a bunch of compounds that boost it naturally.
[55:21.480 --> 55:23.040]  And anybody can take this.
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.480]  Women can take this as well.
[55:24.480 --> 55:26.040]  It doesn't just do stuff with your testosterone.
[55:26.040 --> 55:27.520]  It does everything for your hormones.
[55:27.520 --> 55:30.440]  Real Red Pill Plus, infowarstore.com also does a lot
[55:30.440 --> 55:31.280]  of great stuff.
[55:31.280 --> 55:32.720]  I don't have time to get into all the things that are in it,
[55:32.720 --> 55:35.440]  but this is how we stay on here.
[55:35.440 --> 55:37.360]  And it really works great.
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.800]  That's why we sell it because we want you to like it.
[55:41.800 --> 55:43.440]  It's like a restaurant that cooks good food
[55:43.440 --> 55:45.920]  or a suitmaker that makes good suits.
[55:45.920 --> 55:48.560]  I mean, we don't want to sell you things one time.
[55:50.600 --> 55:53.080]  So many folks run by that model.
[55:53.080 --> 55:53.920]  That is not our model.
[55:53.920 --> 55:55.320]  We don't want to sell you stuff over and over again
[55:55.320 --> 55:57.040]  and stay on there, have a relationship with you
[55:57.040 --> 55:59.560]  and take the same products ourselves that you take.
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.880]  And by the way, I keep extending the sale
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.080]  because quite frankly, I've been busy
[56:05.080 --> 56:06.640]  in my own personal bankruptcy.
[56:06.640 --> 56:08.640]  We're not going off air, it's a reorganization,
[56:08.640 --> 56:11.520]  but my own personal bankruptcy with this whole,
[56:11.520 --> 56:13.200]  you know, new world order fake judgments
[56:13.200 --> 56:14.560]  and all the rest of it.
[56:14.560 --> 56:16.360]  And so I've been having hours a day
[56:16.360 --> 56:18.080]  as I'm filing my schedule next week,
[56:18.080 --> 56:20.680]  having to dive on everything I own, what I've got.
[56:20.680 --> 56:21.800]  It's all independently of perjury.
[56:21.800 --> 56:23.160]  So I've got to really research it,
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.920]  make sure it's dead on.
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.840]  I've been doing that six hours a day
[56:26.840 --> 56:29.640]  on top of the show with this allergy induced
[56:29.640 --> 56:31.680]  in cases of bronchitis that's getting better now.
[56:31.680 --> 56:32.520]  So I'm not complaining.
[56:32.520 --> 56:34.800]  I'm just kind of been a little bit out of commission.
[56:34.800 --> 56:36.480]  I haven't had time to go cut new ads
[56:36.480 --> 56:38.640]  or come with a new sale.
[56:38.640 --> 56:40.600]  And quite frankly, the guys in the warehouse
[56:40.600 --> 56:42.280]  and the folks that run the shopping cart,
[56:42.280 --> 56:44.840]  they said, all this stuff's about to sell out.
[56:44.840 --> 56:45.840]  You're almost out of everything.
[56:45.840 --> 56:48.240]  Some new stuff's coming in a month, hopefully.
[56:48.240 --> 56:51.200]  But just keep the sale going for a couple more days
[56:51.200 --> 56:52.560]  because that's the best thing we got.
[56:52.560 --> 56:53.880]  And it really is a great sale.
[56:53.880 --> 56:55.360]  It's as big as our Christmas sale,
[56:55.360 --> 56:57.000]  up to 50% off on all these items
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.280]  that are very close to selling out.
[56:59.280 --> 57:02.000]  We've got the ultimate, I mean,
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.440]  there's so many great products.
[57:03.440 --> 57:05.720]  We also have vasobites back in stock
[57:05.720 --> 57:08.040]  that also creates nitric oxide in the blood,
[57:08.040 --> 57:09.560]  just like the nitric boost.
[57:09.560 --> 57:12.160]  And again, those two products are apple and oranges.
[57:12.160 --> 57:14.560]  We've got the brain force ultra and brain force,
[57:14.560 --> 57:16.360]  plus two different, total different,
[57:16.360 --> 57:19.160]  new tropics, two different natural stimulant compounds
[57:19.160 --> 57:22.120]  that healthily in a good way give you great focus.
[57:22.120 --> 57:23.600]  They're two different formulas.
[57:25.280 --> 57:27.440]  So it's not that one's better or the other's better.
[57:27.440 --> 57:28.400]  They're both amazing.
[57:28.400 --> 57:32.000]  Those are both 50% off in FullWarStore.com
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.400]  and that sale's gonna end soon as well.
[57:33.400 --> 57:34.840]  All right, I'm done plugging.
[57:34.840 --> 57:36.440]  Hell, I only plugged one time yesterday,
[57:36.440 --> 57:37.600]  so I might do it today.
[57:37.600 --> 57:38.640]  But I got so much news.
[57:38.640 --> 57:39.920]  I wanna give the number out.
[57:39.920 --> 57:40.840]  I'm gonna take your calls.
[57:40.840 --> 57:42.440]  I wanna hit all these other stories.
[57:42.440 --> 57:43.760]  You don't wanna miss hour number two.
[57:43.760 --> 57:45.920]  It is important, but they're now confirming
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.680]  that the Nord Stream Pipeline was a US false flag attack.
[57:48.680 --> 57:52.960]  The cavalry has arrived.
[57:52.960 --> 57:57.880]  Ultimate bone broth is the strongest, highest quality
[57:57.880 --> 57:59.640]  chicken-based bone broth they're gonna find
[57:59.640 --> 58:02.480]  with all of the effects for your joints, your bones,
[58:02.480 --> 58:04.080]  your muscles, your heart,
[58:04.080 --> 58:06.400]  but more importantly, your immune system.
[58:06.400 --> 58:08.720]  Everybody knows about grandma and chicken broth.
[58:08.720 --> 58:10.960]  Well, this is concentrated chicken broth,
[58:10.960 --> 58:13.520]  the strongest out there with chocolate mushroom
[58:13.520 --> 58:16.760]  and a whole bunch of other ingredients like turmeric.
[58:16.760 --> 58:17.800]  The list goes on and on.
[58:17.800 --> 58:21.960]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there
[58:21.960 --> 58:24.960]  and your purchase supports the M4, a 360 win.
[58:24.960 --> 58:26.680]  If you've not experienced bone broth
[58:26.680 --> 58:29.200]  and even the regular ones have great effects,
[58:29.200 --> 58:31.960]  believe me, you wanna get M4's Life,

[58:47.240 --> 58:50.600]  Now, back at stock at m4s4.com for 25% off.
[58:50.600 --> 58:52.680]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[58:52.680 --> 58:55.080]  connect with trusted and unbiased doctors
[58:55.080 --> 58:56.320]  at the wellness company.
[58:56.320 --> 58:58.560]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be
[58:58.560 --> 59:00.240]  the chief scientific officer of the company.
[59:00.240 --> 59:02.960]  I contribute with like so many else do there,
[59:02.960 --> 59:04.760]  so many wonderful doctors.
[59:04.760 --> 59:07.000]  Far and away, the most popular product
[59:07.000 --> 59:10.520]  is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement
[59:10.520 --> 59:12.200]  that features natto kinase.
[59:12.200 --> 59:14.560]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[59:14.560 --> 59:18.320]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now
[59:18.320 --> 59:20.280]  that dissolves the spike protein.
[59:20.280 --> 59:21.120]  This is very important.
[59:21.120 --> 59:23.000]  The spike protein is loaded in the body
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.480]  with the COVID-19 infection,
[59:24.480 --> 59:26.080]  and definitely with the vaccines.
[59:26.080 --> 59:27.600]  People are lower with the spike protein,
[59:27.600 --> 59:28.520]  they don't feel well.
[59:28.520 --> 59:30.240]  This is a potential solution.
[59:30.240 --> 59:33.280]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[59:33.280 --> 59:36.160]  So does ivermectin and now natto kinase.
[59:36.160 --> 59:37.520]  Isn't it interesting?
[59:37.520 --> 59:39.320]  Natural substances, in a sense,
[59:39.320 --> 59:41.800]  combating this man-made disaster,
[59:41.800 --> 59:43.640]  SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[59:43.640 --> 59:46.160]  OnlineHealthNow.com, thank you for your support,
[59:46.160 --> 59:47.560]  and thank you for getting into that,
[59:47.560 --> 59:48.400]  because it's important.
[59:48.400 --> 59:50.560]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[59:50.560 --> 01:00:20.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:50.200]  All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:01:11.280]  I'm going to play a Matt Baker clip and the Moderna CEO,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280]  admitted they had the vaccine before they released it.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.520]  We're going to come back and hit all the Nord Stream news
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]  with a number out and take your calls.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:40.720]  We'll support part of the song now, right here.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.840]  And I'm going to go with the Stefan Banzel.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.240]  Let's talk about vaccine development,
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.240]  because we've heard how it happened,
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.440]  obviously, with COVID-19 starting from 2022,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.200]  and how extraordinary the process was
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.720]  also in terms of the speed.
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.480]  How is development, adoption, and scaling of vaccine
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.440]  going on when it comes to different variants
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.240]  and sub variants?
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.200]  Because this is one of the big concerns
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.560]  as we're all here now.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.720]  And we're discussing, we understand the context,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.280]  and this is a great deal.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.080]  Sure, good morning, and thank you for having me on the panel.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.360]  So the great news versus 2020, where we are today
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.040]  is we have manufacturing capacity.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.200]  As Seth knows, when the pandemic happened,
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.520]  Moderna had made $100,000 in 2019 for the whole year.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.040]  And I remember walking after the hours
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.960]  into the office of my head of manufacturing,
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.640]  and I say, how we make $1 billion next year?
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.440]  And you look at me a bit funny, say what?
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.360]  I say, yeah, we need to make $1 billion next year.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.960]  It's going to be a pandemic.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.280]  Here's Matt Baker reporting live from San Diego, California.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.800]  We are here at the Pfizer location here.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.040]  We are wondering if they may be possibly
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.040]  doing gain-of-function or directed evolution studies here.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.760]  Be honest, I'm getting chills when I look at these things.
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.600]  It's very scary to imagine that just this piece of glass
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.280]  could be all that's between us and the laughing
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.920]  here in San Diego.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.560]  What's really going on here at Pfizer?
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.960]  We've been kicked off the campus for taking
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.560]  some innocuous footage of what appears
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.880]  to be a bioweapons tag lab, much like the one in Wuhan.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.880]  Here I have brought them a copy of the Nuremberg Code.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.720]  And they're also in violation of the International Bioweapons
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.480]  Convention.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.400]  We're going to see if the police are actually
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.360]  going to show up and stop us from exercising our First
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.960]  Amendment.
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.720]  Excuse me, sir.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.400]  How do you feel about protecting the cops?
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  How do you feel about protecting the cops?
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:43.480]  Stop what you are doing.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.640]  Put down the Petri dish.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.520]  Step away from the Globbox.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:51.720]  We're not in Globbox cooking up viruses
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.640]  so we can make money off of a so-called cash cow
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:57.080]  that you remember, are they?
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.000]  So Richard says you are doing.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.480]  Are you concerned with the recent insurances
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.560]  of dying suddenly?
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.080]  Are you concerned that Project Varsus
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:10.480]  may have people in your building,
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.600]  the people of Earth, are on to you?
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.240]  We know what you're doing.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.760]  Pfizer is committing felonies.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.400]  Pfizer is committing war crimes.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.720]  How do you feel working for a company that funds
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.640]  satanic rituals on television?
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.240]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.200]  Every news program on TV.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.080]  Brought to you by Pfizer.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.240]  Did you watch that video by Project Varsus?
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.560]  Did you watch it?
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.000]  Did you watch it, sir?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.280]  Did you see the video?
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.520]  So obviously you guys have the right to film, right?
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.680]  We're not mad.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.600]  How do you mad about what he's talking about?
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.640]  We're not the audience you want to be talking about.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.240]  It doesn't matter.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:45.960]  You are the audience.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.680]  You're the human race.
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.040]  I want you to look it up.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.280]  What I'm doing is I'm telling you to look up Project Varsus
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:51.760]  video.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.200]  I heard you.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:52.800]  Yeah, OK.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.640]  Well, then what was it?
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.000]  You want me to look up Project Varsus.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.240]  Project Varsus mutating viruses.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.920]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.280]  in Four Wars' hands.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.200]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:10.200]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.120]  But when we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.560]  behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.080]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.200]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.640]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.880]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.600]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew,
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.560]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.200]  I only encourage you now to realize
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.640]  that Info Wars cannot stay on air
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.200]  if you do not support us.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.320]  I know you spread the word.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.240]  I know you pray for us.
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:39.840]  And that's wonderful.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.360]  Keep doing it.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.480]  But most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.640]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.120]  your life all at the same time.
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:49.280]  Keep us on air.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.200]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.560]  actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:57.120]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsTour.com,
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.560]  our fighting problems will be over.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.640]  Please take action now.
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.640]  Got it, got it.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:07.440]  That Christmas is coming to you.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:11.760]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.840]  of the Info War.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.840]  We are go.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.160]  Watch.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.480]  First probe.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.560]  Maximum acceleration.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.160]  Can we see the Earth now?
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.160]  We got it.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.640]  Can we see the Earth now?
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.640]  We got it, got it.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.640]  Can we see the Earth now?
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.400]  All right, for the next two hours,
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.320]  I'm taking your phone calls, interspersing it
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.600]  with a hell ton of news.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:57.360]  Wow.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.520]  All right, I'm going to hit the Nord Stream Pipeline
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.600]  and the big breaking news is some little avid added caveats
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.600]  I didn't hit last hour.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.840]  Then I'm going to give the number out on this topic.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.160]  Please indulge me only on that topic.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.240]  I want to hear from you on that.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.480]  Most days is free for all like yesterday.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.840]  Today, it's this topic.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.720]  Please, I want to hear what you think about it, particularly
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.680]  any retired Navy divers or analysts or veterans.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.760]  But the general public is welcome as well.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760]  But before I do that, let me tell you some of the other news.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.560]  I'll be interspersing here in the next two hours
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.720]  for the fourth hour.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.440]  Russia mashing 500,000 men from attack in days
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.320]  as Alinsky begs for UK for help.
[01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:43.680]  Elon Musk announces he will reveal the master plan
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:45.920]  for humanity in less than a month.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.000]  And I've told you this a lot.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.840]  These are competing master plans with different competing
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.960]  elites on what the future of humanity will be.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.800]  Our broadcast is getting you aware this is going on
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.640]  so we the people can unionize, not in the literal union,
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.880]  but in the cultural union of deciding our fate and future
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.960]  and not just letting these people decide them.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.080]  But it looks like Musk is trying to crowdswear people
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.120]  to get behind his operation.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.960]  Great, at least he's being honest about it.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.080]  So let's have a debate that there are elites trying
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.440]  to form control of the world.
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.440]  They've always done it and now they've got the power to do it.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.600]  Continuing more news about cancer exploding in every country
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.440]  that took the shot, particularly young people.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.600]  Some good news, house folks to kill travel,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.520]  vax mandate for foreigners, already killed it for the troops.
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.760]  The other trying to make commanders illegally still order it.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.960]  They should not follow those orders.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.160]  Those are illegal.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.440]  When you're given an illegal order, it's illegal.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.120]  They tell you to put one year old children in deep friars
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.280]  or shoot somebody's dog out of a cannon for no reason.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.200]  You say no.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:47.880]  Continuing by administration,
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.480]  removing most surveillance balloons at the southern border
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.320]  due to cost, they're big cost-effective balloons up at,
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]  tethered at different heights.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.320]  Some are flying around.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.160]  That's where they should be.
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.560]  That's where they're constitutional.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.720]  But no, they're being removed
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.360]  and being sent around the Midwest.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.360]  They're reporting to spy on people's farms
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.560]  in different green areas.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.760]  Make sure you're not building a barn you're not supposed to.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.400]  Can't make that up.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.400]  Elon Musk's Slim's S-I-C-A Center Ship Network
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.920]  is propaganda platform working with the government.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.600]  Barry Diller says the Oscars are over
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.200]  and the movie business is finished.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.800]  I agree with him.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.680]  Fetterman's in the hospital probably had another stroke
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.840]  and the guy can't even talk.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.400]  This is, he's a perfect puppet for him.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.360]  I mean, literally can't even talk.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:36.960]  We've also got a bunch of other key reports.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.600]  On Biden's IRS is officially going after waiters
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.240]  and minimum wage people,
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.320]  even though they pay less than 6% of the taxes,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.240]  95% of the IRS will be targeted on working class poor people.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.640]  I mean, you couldn't be a bigger jerk.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:56.040]  If you, you couldn't run a bigger banner saying,
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.600]  I want to hurt little people and drive them into poverty
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.240]  and make them give up and go on welfare.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.600]  I mean, it's almost like wanting to kill babies
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.800]  even after they're born or drag queen pedophile time
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.400]  or cutting off all the major pipelines in the US
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.160]  and cutting off the coal power plants.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:13.200]  I mean, they are just raping the hell out of us.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.960]  And then Biden gets up there in a speech last week
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:15.880]  and says, it's funny.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:18.320]  Blue collar workers are voting Republican.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.440]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:25.040]  And it's not like the Republicans are even that good.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.200]  The Republican party is like being shot twice
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.720]  with a shotgun.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.320]  And Biden's like being shot 200 times with a shotgun.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.840]  I mean, I don't want to be shot twice.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.120]  I don't want to be shot 500 times.
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.720]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.480]  So you guys actually found the clip in 10 seconds.
[01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.720]  Let me ask you for it.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.120]  Of them saying it?
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:45.320]  Oh, it's B-roll.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.880]  Since I said it, why don't you pull up the clip?
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.720]  It's all over the place.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:50.240]  He says, yeah, suddenly Democrats,
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.800]  we're Democrats, blue collar workers are voting Republican
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.560]  because you're raping everyone.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.520]  So we've got that.
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.720]  Canada's passed the censorship bill
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.480]  of the government to run the internet and surveil everybody.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.440]  We've got the hearings on Twitter,
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.280]  which were powerful in exposing the fraud
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.280]  and how the government and democratic party
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.720]  run all the censorship and control through corporations
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.120]  and how totally illegal it is.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.160]  Florida Dems says to stand as long as citizens
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.520]  to carry weapons without government regulation.
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.360]  It's fascism.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.400]  No, not letting citizens protect themselves is fascism.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.040]  Fascists always take the citizens' guns.
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.680]  Madonna looks completely demonic.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.480]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.000]  And what's serving evil to us.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:34.960]  Oh, they found the Biden clip.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.400]  Here it is.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.800]  Those of you who were over 40,
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.440]  do you ever think we'd be in a situation
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.840]  where blue collar workers are voting Republican?
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.160]  No, no, let's, let's, we've got to be honest, man.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.080]  Because they think we forgot them.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.040]  They think we don't care.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.320]  And he's like, we haven't forgotten you.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.960]  Even though people making $40,000 a year or less
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.080]  pays 6% of taxes, I'm going to say that again,
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.000]  the group that pays less than 6% of the taxes,
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.320]  like 5.5% is the last number I saw,
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.240]  we're going to spend 95% of our enforcement on them.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.040]  That isn't to get money.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.560]  That ain't to get revenue.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.320]  You know what, if you see the, oh, I mean,
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.440]  oh, that's the single parents
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.600]  they're trying to screw over.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.720]  That's the hardworking little families
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.600]  where dad served five years in the military
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.880]  and now works at a gas station and, you know,
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.320]  mom works at a daycare center and they got two kids
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.400]  and they like to, you know, try to pay for food and baby diapers.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:41.360]  No, you don't get anything.
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.400]  They've got new spy programs they report
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.280]  where they're going to have a government fund
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.920]  to have other waiters and waitresses
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:50.760]  and other blue collar workers
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.160]  tattle on who's getting cash.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.720]  So they want to get rid of cash, but oh,
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.120]  you're surviving on cash?
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.160]  Oh, no, you're not.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.360]  No, you're not.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.360]  We're going to step on you
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.800]  and we're going to grind your ass into the ground
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:10.480]  and then we're going to get up on TV and promise
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.680]  reparations to all the black people.
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.040]  Your every black person will get $5 million
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:17.240]  if you vote Democrat.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.440]  Just like last year, everyone that has school bills
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:29.400]  and tuition loans, it's all going to be forgiven
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:34.040]  for student loans and then as soon as you got elected,
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.200]  he said, I'm sorry, we're not doing that.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:43.200]  Do you think someone that hires 87,000 IRS agents last year
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:49.320]  when he first got in quadrupled attacks on working people
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:54.680]  and the working poor, do you think he's going to give you
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.880]  reparations, whether you're for him or against him?
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.880]  Do you think he's going to give you tuition debt jubilee?
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.360]  The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.080]  They want to hurt you.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.720]  They want to bankrupt you.
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.200]  They want you destitute.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.840]  While they sit there and claim they love you,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.680]  like all these big unions helping sell the jobs out
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.840]  to China and Mexico and India and everywhere else.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.520]  Well, they tell you, oh, we love the working people.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.760]  We love the working class and don't get me wrong.
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.160]  You got the Koch brothers over on the other side
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.000]  trying to bring in all the cheap labor they can
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.680]  to exploit and then exploit everybody else.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.000]  Caught between a rock and a hard place.
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.880]  I want to talk about the North Street pipeline.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.440]  All the evidence inside Intel, false flag,
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.520]  run by the Biden, Obama, third administration,
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.880]  the fallout, where's it going, Russia's next imminent
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:59.720]  massive invasion, part two.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.800]  We're going to cover it all.
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:05.320]  World War III coverage right now.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.320]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539er.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  877-789, Alex, or if you speak Spanish, Alejandro.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:22.280]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.640]  The topics, World War III and all the fun
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.720]  that goes along with it and the centerpiece,
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.680]  the deep state caught blowing up the Nord Stream pipeline
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:34.440]  and a war inside the deep state
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.640]  for not just the future of America,
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.560]  but the future of the world.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.560]  I am your pro-human, pro-future, pro-anti-nuclear war.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.480]  Talk show hosts, I am the battle-hardened, humbled,
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.000]  thankful servant of we the people.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.840]  Alex Jones, stay with us.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.560]  I talk a lot about the great successes
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.920]  Info Wars has had.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.840]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:09.880]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.560]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars,
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:15.200]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.720]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.840]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.280]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.600]  five, six, seven days a week.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.560]  It's really just incredible.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.240]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew,
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.200]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.640]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:37.000]  Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.880]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.040]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.200]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.520]  and you never buy great products
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.120]  that enrich and empower your life.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.960]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.840]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.240]  actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.800]  If just 1% more of you took action at wentinfowarstore.com,
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.200]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.400]  Please take action now.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.480]  Info Wars secret weapon is finally here.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.400]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.720]  for your stamina, for your energy,
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.800]  for your way of life, for your libido.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.840]  And it also keeps Info Wars on the air.

[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.680]  in stores around the country.
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.520]  That's because we go right

[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.800]  that supplies some of the top names.

[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.880]  because the owner is a listener
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.280]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.

[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.880]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:10.520]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.160]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.320]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.320]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it,
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:23.800]  flip it up or rub it down, Alex Jones was right.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.320]  Think about how frustrated we are
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.280]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:29.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.920]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.040]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.520]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.040]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.120]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.960]  That's why the globalists hate me
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.000]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.000]  AlexJonesLive.com.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:03.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.960]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.960]  So here's Puppet Biden,
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.960]  State Department operative, Victoria Newland.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.960]  Months before they blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline,
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.960]  bragging how they were gonna do it. Here it is.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.960]  It's Russian Vades.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:27.960]  That means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.960]  It's Russian Vades.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.960]  That means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:42.960]  Again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.960]  We will bring an end to it.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.960]  But how will you do that?
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.960]  Exactly.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.960]  Since the project and control of the project
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.960]  is within Germany's control.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.960]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.960]  With regard to Nord Stream 2,
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.960]  we continue to have very strong and clear conversations
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.960]  with our German allies,
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.960]  and I want to be clear with you today.
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.960]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another,
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.960]  Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.960]  I can't think of a more powerful way to punish
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.960]  Russian aggression than by rolling back
[01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:29.960]  what progress has been made,
[01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.960]  and if at all possible, prevent the Nord Stream 2
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.960]  from ever being completed.
[01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.960]  Is that something that is being discussed with allies?
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.960]  Is that something that's being contemplated?
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960]  Absolutely.
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.960]  And as you recall from the July U.S. German statement,
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.960]  that was very much in that statement
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.960]  that if any moves Russian aggression against Ukraine
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.960]  would have a direct impact on the pipeline,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.960]  and that is our expectation
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.960]  and the conversation that we're having.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:03.960]  So again, direct impact is one thing,
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.960]  but I'm literally talking about rolling back
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.960]  the pipeline.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.960]  I mean, loosely to find that,
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.960]  but I mean taking action that will prevent it
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:17.960]  from ever becoming operational.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:20.960]  I think if President Putin moves on Ukraine,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.960]  our expectation is that the pipeline will be suspended.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:29.960]  Well, I certainly hope that the Center for Foreign Relations
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:33.960]  Committee would take up legislation to go beyond
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.960]  just suspending it, but from ending it permanently.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:38.960]  But anyway, thank you, undersecretary.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.960]  By the way, Johnson said family hurt by the shots.
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:45.960]  That shows how these politicians are good on some issues
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.960]  and not there he is wanting an attack to get the attack.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.960]  That's just stupid.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.960]  All right, that's my view.
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:58.960]  Hammer, Hardy, Carlos, Sue, Matt, Deshaun, Sean,
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.960]  Robert, Joe, Tom, Simon, Matt,
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.960]  we're taking all your calls and more here today.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.960]  Now I'm going to intersperse all that news I mentioned
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]  in the last segment in between,
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.960]  and I'm very upset about what's going on in Project Veritas.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.960]  I haven't gotten around to calling James O'Keefe
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.960]  since I learned this yesterday afternoon,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:22.960]  but the statement by the board of Veritas is very troubling.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:27.960]  He goes and gets that giant coup,
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:33.960]  catching the Pfizer executive in all those activities.
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.960]  They confirm it's a Pfizer executive.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:37.960]  All hell breaks loose.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:39.960]  The FBI is threatening criminal charges against Veritas,
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.960]  and it looks like they're buckling.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.960]  And if you want to know how this works,
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:46.960]  you need to watch JFK,
[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.960]  which has all turned out to movies, incredible.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.960]  It's like a documentary, though it's a film by Oliver Stone.
[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.960]  I watched it again a few weeks ago.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.960]  And it's incredible.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.960]  There was like 10 Academy Awards for that.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:06.960]  And you've got the FBI agents that work for Garrison,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960]  retired FBI agents that work in the prosecutor's office there
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.960]  in New Orleans, threatening other members' families,
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:12.960]  you know, behind the scenes
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:14.960]  and turning them against Garrison behind his back.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:15.960]  That's what goes on.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.960]  The heat, the pressure they put on you,
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.960]  folks, they put incredible pressure on us.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.960]  And I can't turn the whole show into telling you
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.960]  what's been done behind the scenes to us,
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.960]  but it's been horrible, but it's been your prayers,
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:28.960]  your support that's kept us on air to go through this,
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960]  and I'm so committed.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.960]  I don't even know how to quit.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.960]  But it looks like it doesn't look like it.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.960]  I'm very disturbed.
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:39.960]  And I talked to James here and there on the phone.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:41.960]  We've gone out to dinner a few times.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.960]  I'm going to call him as soon as I get off fire today.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.960]  And he's been relieved.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.960]  He's been kicked out.
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:50.960]  He's been put on paid leave.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.960]  And their statement's like,
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.960]  well, we're a bigger group than James O'Keefe.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:58.960]  That statement tells you they are removing him.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.960]  And it's a direct response to his biggest thing they ever did
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.960]  two weeks ago.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  You see the timing of it.
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.960]  It's very troublesome.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.960]  And I mean, I'm surprised Veritas is still there.
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.960]  They have committed crimes against the deep state
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.960]  of doing a great job.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.960]  And O'Keefe's leadership and their whole team.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.960]  And I'm sure they're about to indict a bunch of people
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.960]  that worked there if they don't do this.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:30.960]  And I think they made the wrong move.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.960]  I think they'll still get indicted now
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.960]  with all the criminal investigations against them.
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.960]  So I think they blinked.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.960]  This came with chicken.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960]  I mean, at a certain point in chicken,
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.960]  you just got to just jam down the accelerator
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.960]  and say, I'm ready.
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  I'm not turning this car.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960]  I'm going.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.960]  But the good news is that if they want to go ahead
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.960]  politically as an allegory,
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.960]  then we take the enemy out and we go, too,
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:52.960]  and the kids can be safe.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  I mean, that's what war is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.960]  As you decide, I ain't given up and I'm not going anywhere.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.960]  And O'Keefe hasn't given up.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.960]  And if there's anybody out there that I can compare to us,
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.960]  and I'm not trying to say, oh, I'm so great,
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960]  it's James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.960]  If I've got peers and I'm not that good,
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:14.960]  I'm sorry, there's not people that have done more.
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:20.960]  It's James O'Keefe and Tucker Carlson.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:22.960]  There's a lot of other amazing people,
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]  the Steve Bannon's of the world,
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.960]  and the Jack
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.960]  But when the rubber meets the road for just the massive
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.960]  effect on tyranny, battling for liberty,
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.960]  breaking thousands of stories,
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.960]  just fearless out of the park work over and over again,
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:27:10.960]  just fearless out of the park work.
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:39.960]  But that's it because we've been doing it longer.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:28:08.960]  We've been doing it longer.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  We've been doing it longer.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:29:06.960]  We've been doing it longer.

[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:01.960]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:08.960]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:08.960 --> 02:18:12.960]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:21.960]  Alex has been right on for over a decade. I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:28.960]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:32.960]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:36.960]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax. Not for a second.
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:39.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.960]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.960]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:50.960]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:19:11.960]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:21.960]  The most popular product is Dr. Van de Water's detoxification supplement that features natokinase. It's a natural proteolytic enzyme.
[02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:27.960]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:32.960]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection and definitely with the vaccines.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:35.960]  People are low with the spike protein. They don't feel well.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.960]  This is a potential solution.
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:43.960]  Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance. So does ivermectin and now natokinase.
[02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:50.960]  Isn't it interesting? Natural substances in a sense combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.960]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support and thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:20:08.960]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:35.960]  Alright, here phone calls are coming up next segment on the pipeline being blown up.
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:40.960]  Matt Baker has hundreds of millions of views in his videos confronting city councils during lockdowns.
[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:46.960]  You name it. This is a great talk show. You can find it at Matt Breaker underscore unhinged on Instagram.
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:50.960]  Band-up video, slave liberty. And as you mentioned, Twitter earlier, slave liberty.
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:56.960]  Matt, big picture, though. You're onto something here. I've gone and protested at the New York FISA facility.
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:00.960]  Others have peacefully exposing them and then putting it online.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:06.960]  But we need big demonstrations like they have in Europe because these are the folks that have been caught killing so many people.
[02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:12.960]  Other comments on that, your view on the Nord Stream pipeline, that news coming out, just everything that's happening.
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:17.960]  Yeah, actually, I was kind of told that I was going to get an hour, so I had a whole thing planned.
[02:21:17.960 --> 02:21:21.960]  Let's do that. I thought it was 30 minutes, but we got calls. You can roll with calls with us, but go ahead.
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:26.960]  Actually, I would love to do a call section. I've been wanting to do that, itching to do that.
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:32.960]  The pipeline. Well, I mean, Kibono, as they say in Latin, who benefits.
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:37.960]  And we know that the Russians do not benefit from blowing up their own pipeline. Let's put it that way.
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:42.960]  I'm so glad you guys finally pulled out that Biden clip because you were mentioning earlier and I'm like,
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:47.960]  remember these things. We have a memory. It's like Biden said, we're gonna blow it up.
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.960]  That's why I had the shades on actually.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:50.960]  Who's up?
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:52.960]  No, no, we're gonna blow it up.
[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:54.960]  On the water, we're gonna take out the pipeline.
[02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:56.960]  No, no, no, we're gonna take out the pipeline.
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:59.960]  We want to blow it up, it's so high.
[02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:01.960]  Don't worry about it, kid, don't worry about it, Jack.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:03.960]  Hey, don't jump. We know your gas pipes are high.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:06.960]  Don't jump, man. Hey, we know the beverages are coming up.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:08.960]  They're going everywhere. Don't jump, man.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:10.960]  Come on in.
[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:15.960]  So obviously, Biden did it. He said he was going to do it.
[02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:16.960]  Why would he not do it?
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:23.960]  I mean, not Biden, the powers that be, the puppets that operate the animatronic Biden did it.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.960]  And let me tell you this.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:28.960]  Okay, so I live in one bedroom house in San Diego.
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.960]  Now, it's not cheap because I am in San Diego, California, and the prices are way higher,
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:38.960]  and the sun and weather does make it worthwhile, regardless of the lunatics that we got to deal with.
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:47.960]  My bill for gas was three times, 300%. It went up, okay?
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:54.960]  So the people wanted to know, why is it 300% up?
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.960]  And the reason is because the global market for gas is global.
[02:22:58.960 --> 02:23:02.960]  And so the price goes up a little bit when there's a little bit less.
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:06.960]  When there becomes a lot less, the people absolutely need it,
[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:09.960]  and they can charge whatever the hell they want for it.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:12.960]  If grannies are about to die, they don't care how much it's going to cost,
[02:23:12.960 --> 02:23:14.960]  they're going to turn up that heater.
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.960]  And that's where they've got the world, right there on the edge,
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:19.960]  where there's just enough to keep it going.
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:21.960]  And if they want to click it off, they can't.
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:22.960]  And let's put it this way.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:25.960]  Here in San Diego, we already have literally,
[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:27.960]  literally, and I'm not making this up either,
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:30.960]  the highest electricity price in the country.
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:36.960]  The local commissar, Todd Gloria, has went along with this globalist thing
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:39.960]  and said, we're going to stop gas stoves in San Diego.
[02:23:39.960 --> 02:23:41.960]  So my house is on gas.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:44.960]  And traditionally, it was always cheaper running the gas stoves
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:46.960]  and running the gas heaters.
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:48.960]  And so now they're going to force you about it.
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.960]  Exactly. That's what they've said.
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:53.960]  We're going to make gas so expensive you can't use it.
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:56.960]  Same thing with coal, same thing with oil.
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:58.960]  Exactly. And they said that. Obama said,
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:01.960]  sure, you can have your coal plant.
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:03.960]  You just won't be able to afford it.
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:06.960]  And then they do it and then they wonder what is happening.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.960]  People are literally getting kicked out of their houses.
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:14.960]  If you can't afford to pay your rent, you have to put your electric bill out.
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:16.960]  You have to run your electricity.
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:18.960]  You can't have them shut off your electricity in the winter.
[02:24:18.960 --> 02:24:20.960]  Even out here, it's been cold.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:22.960]  People are putting it on.
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:25.960]  And now Biden's hired 87,000 IRS agents in his own words
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:28.960]  to go after waiters who pay a fraction of the taxes.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:30.960]  Total harassment.
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  Exactly. Because like we know, the New World Order,
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.960]  the people that are already in the system that work for corporations,
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:41.960]  maybe they have a kid or two, they're not too big of a problem,
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:43.960]  because they're already on the teat.
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:45.960]  They're already getting the meetings.
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:47.960]  They already have to do the training, like,
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:51.960]  oh, gender training and inclusivity training at work
[02:24:51.960 --> 02:24:53.960]  if they say something wrong.
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:55.960]  They don't have them in their little mind control box.
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:57.960]  The people who they don't have are people like me
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:59.960]  who run their own businesses,
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:02.960]  who can spend half of their life making zero dollars
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.960]  going around fighting for freedom.
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:06.960]  The other people are stuck in their little thing.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:08.960]  They'll lose their whole gig if they go.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.960]  They'll have to take their vaccine.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:12.960]  And so who is the enemy, the American people,
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:15.960]  and the people who have their own independent businesses?
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:18.960]  That's right. Non-domesticated humans that are free-range humans.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:21.960]  This is all about domesticating as forced slaughter.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:23.960]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:27.960]  So the enemy, the enemy of the people, is America.
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:29.960]  That's why we're under attack.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:31.960]  American Christians are under attack.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.960]  Constitutionals, Americans are under attack.
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:36.960]  And we're under a global attack. Why?
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:39.960]  Because we're the only thing that is breaking the New World Order,
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:41.960]  screaming down the track,
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:44.960]  and there's this little berm called America.
[02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:46.960]  And it's like...
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.960]  And it's like, they just want to knock that berm over
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:51.960]  and just mow down the entire planet.
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:53.960]  And so everybody who's got a business, got to go.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.960]  Anybody who wants free speech, got to go.
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:57.960]  Anybody who likes guns, got to go.
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:00.960]  James O'Keefe, got to go. Alex Jones, got to go.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:02.960]  Everyone loves analogies, right?
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:04.960]  And the Super Bowl is coming up.
[02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:06.960]  I got an analogy for everyone here.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.960]  I got an analogy for all those red-blooded Americans
[02:26:09.960 --> 02:26:12.960]  who are going to be sitting there enjoying the Super Bowl,
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.960]  like we used to back in the day before the war started,
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:16.960]  before we were under attack and if you just enjoy our lives,
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:19.960]  have our barbecue and play with our children
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:22.960]  without our boys having dresses on and cutting your dicks off.
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:24.960]  Okay? So here's what you do.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:26.960]  When you're watching the Super Bowl,
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:28.960]  I want you to imagine the 11 of the players,
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:31.960]  those are the globalist operators.
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:33.960]  Those are your little Bill Gates' is.
[02:26:33.960 --> 02:26:35.960]  Those are your Fauci's.
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:37.960]  And then we got 11 people on our field.
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:40.960]  That's the Alex Jones, that's the Matt Baker,
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:42.960]  that's the James O'Keefe.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:45.960]  And they're playing this battle for not half of the stadium.
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:48.960]  They're playing it for the whole stadium, you see.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:50.960]  So all the people in the crowd,
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.960]  their lives are hinging on what's going on.
[02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:55.960]  Now, the problem is, the people who are playing on the one side
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:57.960]  are playing for the people in the skybox.
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.960]  And those are the moneymakers, those are the globalists,
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:01.960]  those are the guys that own the team, you see.
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:04.960]  Their team, team evil, team enemy, team enemy America.
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:07.960]  And the free humanity has our individual players out there.
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.960]  Now, we're in a battle, okay, for the entire stadium.
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:13.960]  Let's say they all get rounded up.
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:15.960]  At the end, if, oh, sorry, we went to a FEMA camp,
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.960]  I guess we lost the game, it didn't work out.
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:19.960]  No, because the game is rigged.
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.960]  Just like it is in a gladiator,
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.960]  they go in and he stabs the gladiator in the chest
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:27.960]  so he can go out and pretend to have his victory.
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:30.960]  See, Alex Jones goes out, he's slaughtering,
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:32.960]  he's killing metaphorically,
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:35.960]  destroying all of their narratives.
[02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.960]  And so as they see the game, they're like,
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:39.960]  oh, we're just playing a game, it's free, it's free.
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:42.960]  And then at the end they go, oh, stab Alex Jones.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:44.960]  They slit your throat on Twitter.
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:46.960]  Elon Musk, shame on you.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  Trying to be Alex Jones.
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:51.960]  They slit your throat, they slit James O'Keefe's throat.
[02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:53.960]  They shut all the patriots down.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.960]  And then they go, whoa, we're all just having a free game.
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:57.960]  It's a private company.
[02:27:57.960 --> 02:28:00.960]  And then when the humanity loses the game,
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.960]  we say, well, it was a fair battle.
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:05.960]  No, I want you to join the game.
[02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:07.960]  Get down on the field.
[02:28:07.960 --> 02:28:09.960]  And when those little bastards in the skybox
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:11.960]  come down to join Fauci and all their little players,
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:13.960]  they'll have about 30 people on the field.
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:16.960]  They're like, well, I have $7 billion.
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:18.960]  Get up and do something.
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.960]  What you just said, stay there, you're on fire,
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.960]  is the George Arwell speech.
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.960]  If we could get the general public, the proletarians to wake up,
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:27.960]  we would win. Absolutely.
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:29.960]  You're not spectators, you're on the field.
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:31.960]  There's only 11 globalists.
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:33.960]  You think of it as they're fighting us that are the well-known people.
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:35.960]  No, it's all of us.
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:37.960]  All of you can do what Matt Baker did
[02:28:37.960 --> 02:28:39.960]  and go to Pfizer peacefully to expose them.
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.960]  I want to see thousands there this Sunday,
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.960]  3 p.m. at Pfizer.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:46.960]  And Matt, they can go to your Twitter
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:48.960]  and you'll put out where the event is.
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:50.960]  People can be there. We all got to pray for James O'Keefe.
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.960]  They're right back. He'll write shock.
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.960]  Everyone, this will take phone calls.
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:56.960]  And we'll get you back on, Matt.
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:29:10.960]  The cavalry has arrived.

[02:29:57.960 --> 02:30:01.960]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:08.960]  I want you all to know something, Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:12.960]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:15.960]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:19.960]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:21.960]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:23.960]  Think about how frustrated we are
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:25.960]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:27.960]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.960]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:33.960]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:30:33.960 --> 02:30:36.960]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:42.960]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:45.960]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:47.960]  That's why the globalists hate me
[02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:51.960]  because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:30:57.960 --> 02:30:59.960]  I have an extremely important message
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:01.960]  to all of my fellow Info Warriors
[02:31:01.960 --> 02:31:03.960]  here in the United States and around the world.
[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:08.960]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:11.960]  It turns out the top company in the U.S.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:13.960]  for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:15.960]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:17.960]  that no one else is getting
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:19.960]  because they want to support Info Wars
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:20.960]  and keep us on the air.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.960]  This deal has been a year in the making
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:24.960]  and finally the products are being brought to market.
[02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:28.960]  Up to 50% off what you get on top national brands
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:31.960]  of the highest rated under the Info Wars label,
[02:31:31.960 --> 02:31:35.960]  Info Wars MD, exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.960]  Check out the first of 10 new products
[02:31:38.960 --> 02:31:40.960]  at infowarstore.com,
[02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:42.960]  whether it's turmeric or whether it's joint care
[02:31:42.960 --> 02:31:44.960]  or whether it is super greens.
[02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:48.960]  We have them all at infowarstore.com
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:52.960]  under the banner of Info Wars MD.
[02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:54.960]  This is the best deal out there
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:56.960]  and it keeps Info Wars on the air.
[02:31:56.960 --> 02:32:15.960]  We're so stupid we let them kill us. We deserve it.
[02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:30.960]  A pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:31.960]  Now the translation is,
[02:32:31.960 --> 02:32:36.960]  I looked and behold a pale horse
[02:32:36.960 --> 02:32:38.960]  and his name that sat on him was Death
[02:32:38.960 --> 02:32:41.960]  and Hell followed with him.
[02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:45.960]  A book of revelation.
[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:46.960]  Very serious times to be alive folks.
[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.960]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.960]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:52.960]  This is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:54.960]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[02:32:54.960 --> 02:32:56.960]  They're very upset that they're losing
[02:32:56.960 --> 02:33:22.960]  on the way they thought it would.
[02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:35.960]  And this Friday, 6 p.m. Central,
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:38.960]  right after the war room at AlexShowsLive.com,
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:44.960]  Matt Becker will be back on.
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:46.960]  And Sunday they're going to be there protesting at Pfizer
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:50.960]  in San Diego, California peacefully exposing
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:52.960]  their murderous kind of function
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:54.960]  and all their admissions of mutating the viruses
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.960]  and everything else.
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:57.960]  Everybody should be there.
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:33:59.960]  Whether it's a hundred people or a thousand,
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:00.960]  it will be massive.
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:03.960]  Everybody can videotape it, post it everywhere
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:05.960]  and take what Matt's done and take it to the next level
[02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:06.960]  because he already has all these viral clips
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:08.960]  of city councils and speeches he gives.
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:10.960]  This needs to go mega viral.
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:11.960]  What he's done is already gone viral
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:13.960]  but we need to have everybody join him.
[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:16.960]  All right, I appreciate the Sean holding,
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.960]  Dave holding, Tove holding, Scott holding,
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:22.960]  Marvin, Robert, Steve,
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:24.960]  we're going to do all you the order received.
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:26.960]  He's riding a shotgun with us to the sour ends
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:28.960]  of Paul Joseph Watson from England,
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:30.960]  takes over in the fourth hour of the war room
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.960]  at 3 p.m. Central with Owen Schreuer.
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:33.960]  But Matt, other points you wanted to add
[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.960]  before we go to these calls
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:36.960]  and what are you going to be talking about
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:39.960]  with me at 6 p.m. on Friday?
[02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.960]  Well, I mean, I just have so many things
[02:34:41.960 --> 02:34:43.960]  on this crystallized reality.
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:44.960]  It's like a fractal.
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:47.960]  Every part of it is the big picture.
[02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:50.960]  It's like you scratch the surface anywhere into this
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:52.960]  and you get into the whole thing,
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.960]  into the battle between good and evil,
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:56.960]  into the control versus freedom,
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:58.960]  into who's running the world,
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:01.960]  into how they're slitting our throats,
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:04.960]  how they're pulling off these pipelines
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:05.960]  and doing all this.
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:06.960]  It's a new modern form of warfare
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:09.960]  where they're not coming at you directly.
[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.960]  They're actually just like in the movie The Matrix,
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:14.960]  when they actually take one of the players
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.960]  out of The Matrix, they just go up
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:18.960]  and they pull the plug out of the back
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:20.960]  of the person's head and they just go,
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.960]  that's what they're doing to America.
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.960]  They're pulling these plugs.
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:25.960]  They're pulling the pipelines.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:27.960]  Biden shuts down pipelines.
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.960]  They cut them off around the world.
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:30.960]  They're using...
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:31.960]  They already shipped the jobs to China.
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:33.960]  They already created all the regulations,
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:34.960]  the racial division,
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:37.960]  and now they're just cutting the power off.
[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:40.960]  And they're using the war, I believe,
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.960]  at a higher level on the chessboard.
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:44.960]  They're using the war for the great reset
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:46.960]  so that each part of the world,
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:48.960]  eventually as the stakes keep elevating,
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:50.960]  we're slowly going to be like,
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:53.960]  then there'll be an excuse for why our pipeline blew up.
[02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:56.960]  There'll be an excuse for why our nuclear power plant went down.
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:59.960]  There'll be an excuse for this eyeball.
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.960]  This balloon popping over in your...
[02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:05.960]  And they're already blowing up food processing plants every day.
[02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:09.960]  They're putting out poison feed to the chickens.
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.960]  I mean, it's full war.
[02:36:11.960 --> 02:36:13.960]  Exactly.
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:15.960]  And just before we'll go into the callers,
[02:36:15.960 --> 02:36:17.960]  trust me, I got mad.
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:19.960]  I can go on and on and on.
[02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:21.960]  But what I really want, a big topic
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:24.960]  and a big thing I want to say to all the patriots out there,
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:27.960]  I do believe that there's a new level
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:29.960]  to the game that they're playing.
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:31.960]  We always say, oh, we're playing chess.
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:32.960]  They're playing checkers.
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:34.960]  But it's not that way anymore.
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:36.960]  They are thinking moves ahead.
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:38.960]  You've got to stop thinking that way.
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:41.960]  So a lot of times what I've noticed is one of the newest phenomenon
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:44.960]  is what I'm calling conspiracy lures.
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:48.960]  They know that there's a free-thinking population out there
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:50.960]  that doesn't buy what they're saying.
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:52.960]  So they're using these lures.
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:54.960]  They put them out there like the Demar Hamlin,
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:57.960]  and they're trying to make people focus on these things
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:36:59.960]  and they'll give you the conspiracy...
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.960]  100% that Demar Hamlin thing is distraction.
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:06.960]  Only to then prove you wrong
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:09.960]  can they make critical thinking the enemy of people.
[02:37:09.960 --> 02:37:11.960]  So they go, well, conspiracy theorists
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:13.960]  is basically a person who looks at what they're being told.
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:15.960]  They know right off the bat that's a lie.
[02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:17.960]  They're smart enough to figure that out.
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:18.960]  And then they go, well, let's see.
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.960]  Biden said he was going to blow up the pipeline,
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:21.960]  and the pipeline blew up.
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:23.960]  Maybe that was Biden.
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:24.960]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:27.960]  So when they call everything a conspiracy theory,
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:30.960]  that's French for critical thinking.
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:33.960]  But what they want to do and put into the mind of the human
[02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:35.960]  and the average sheep, as they're starting to wake up,
[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:37.960]  they're like, wait, maybe these conspiracy theories
[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:38.960]  are on something.
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.960]  Maybe critical thinking is a good idea.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:43.960]  Then they go, ha, see they were wrong about Demar Hamlin.
[02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:45.960]  Ha, see they were wrong about this.
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:48.960]  Yeah, exactly. They jam it with disinfo.
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:50.960]  Yeah, and you actually mentioned this before.
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:53.960]  It was what they do, what Reddit Air used to do
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:58.960]  with the oil wells, where they'll blow up an oil well
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:00.960]  to actually put it out.
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.960]  So there'll be a percolating conspiracy theory
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.960]  where we're starting to put two and two together.
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:06.960]  They throw red meat for the dogs.
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:09.960]  We go, ah, and then they run away with the chickens
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:10.960]  on the oil side.
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:12.960]  Yeah, I mean, WikiLeaks is pedophilia,
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.960]  Alistair Crowley rituals, Obama officials at the meetings.
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:18.960]  Six-year-olds are ready for you in the bedroom.
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:20.960]  They're ready for you in the hot tub.
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:23.960]  They distract to a pizza place and make everybody run to that.
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:24.960]  Exactly.
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:27.960]  And shame, no offense, Demar Hamlin.
[02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:30.960]  You should come out and have a real conference,
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:32.960]  not one where they have their hand up your ass
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:34.960]  and they're telling you what to say.
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.960]  Okay, I want to know what really happened.
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:39.960]  After that, no one ever said it was commercial quarters again.
[02:38:39.960 --> 02:38:41.960]  Oh, there's no doubt they're controlling him and no doubt.
[02:38:41.960 --> 02:38:43.960]  But even those videos like, look, no tattoos.
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:45.960]  You can see he's in dark.
[02:38:45.960 --> 02:38:46.960]  You can see the tattoos.
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.960]  He's alive.
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.960]  Yes, and I honestly feel like they're doing that on purpose.
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:56.960]  They're probably make-up-ing in mountain stuff just to add to it.
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:57.960]  This is what I know for a fact.
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:01.960]  There's no reason why Demar Hamlin had to come into that field.
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:05.960]  And do that whole spectacle where you could never see his face
[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:07.960]  and through the window and all that.
[02:39:07.960 --> 02:39:09.960]  That was 100% pizza gate 2.0.
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.960]  We got to go to the calls, but you're on fire.
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:15.960]  We'll do two hours, Friday evening, 6 p.m. central.
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:16.960]  Let's do it.
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:17.960]  All your notes.
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:18.960]  Be ready, brother.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.960]  Let's go to calls.
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:20.960]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:21.960]  We got to go to these calls.
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:22.960]  They've been holding.
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:23.960]  Deshaun in California, you're on the air.
[02:39:23.960 --> 02:39:24.960]  Go ahead.
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:25.960]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:26.960]  Let me be brief for a minute.
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:30.960]  But what's going on is, like I said, with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:35.960]  the New World Order has always targeted Germany every time.
[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:39.960]  Since World War I to World War II, and now with this World War III
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:42.960]  kicking off, they bring Germany back into it.
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:46.960]  And what I think they're trying to do is creep Bertha Hitler
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:48.960]  out of this Germany thing.
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:49.960]  But it won't happen.
[02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:50.960]  No, but you're right.
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:53.960]  The globalists always try to get Germans to fight Russia.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:54.960]  Right.
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:57.960]  And the point is, the world evolved now.
[02:39:57.960 --> 02:40:00.960]  And then, due to the internet, they see the whole history of it
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:02.960]  to what nobody wants to fight.
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.960]  And Russia has every right to invade Ukraine and take it
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:08.960]  because he's seeing us get overthrown.
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:10.960]  That's why he reacted.
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:13.960]  If Trump would have stayed in office, he wouldn't be doing this.
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:16.960]  But he knows US has been overthrown and compromised.
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:18.960]  And now we got Chinese balloons floating over us,
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:20.960]  and they friends with Russia.
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:24.960]  They could be sending Russia to the images from Montana where the silos at.
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:26.960]  You're on the right to Russia.
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:28.960]  That's crazy.
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:29.960]  I agree, brother.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:32.960]  How do we stop it, Deshaun?
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:34.960]  This was, look, the military been compromised.
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.960]  They're not going to help us at all.
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.960]  They don't know we were in the coup.
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.960]  So we have to, like I said, form malicious and arrest every politician.
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:44.960]  They're all corrupt.
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:45.960]  They're all unelected.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:47.960]  This is the only way we're going to get out of this.
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:48.960]  But we are in a revolution.
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.960]  And come 2024, you're going to see that we can't pick another president
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:56.960]  because if Trump run again, they're not going to let him in.
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:59.960]  And he's going to stand down and they're going to bring in whoever they want.
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:03.960]  Or they're going to throw the election and still give it to somebody else besides Trump.
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:05.960]  Now, we don't know who that is.
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:06.960]  So that's the big problem.
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:09.960]  We don't know who they got in the background ready to take the place.
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:10.960]  And they're right in front of our face.
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:11.960]  They're going to do it to us.
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:14.960]  And they're going to take the election and they're going to see what we're going to do about it.
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:19.960]  That's why they've been having this little revel, the Hamlin, that was all fake.
[02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:23.960]  What they're trying to do is wake the people up to the tactics that they're killing us with the virus.
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:25.960]  And we just not reacting.
[02:41:25.960 --> 02:41:28.960]  I got military choppers right now flying over my head.
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:31.960]  Right in California, man.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:33.960]  They over here daily.
[02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:35.960]  It's crazy to Sean.
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:36.960]  Great points.
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:37.960]  We're going to break and come right back with everybody else.
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:41.960]  I promise with every caller here up next when we come back is Dave.
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:42.960]  But we got a minute to break.
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:46.960]  What do you want to say about what their caller just said?
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.960]  Well, I want to go off about the balloon a little bit.
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.960]  And everyone's like, shoot it down.
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:51.960]  Shoot it down.
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:53.960]  I thought that was the dumbest idea ever.
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:56.960]  Let's say they wanted to cover for a bio weapon release.
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:58.960]  They could have just said, oh, that was the balloon.
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  So why wouldn't we, with our skill, have a net and just put some weight on it?
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:06.960]  This is not a rocket ship.
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:07.960]  This is a balloon.
[02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:09.960]  It uses buoyancy to keep itself up.
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:17.960]  Attach some ropes to it and weigh it down and land it perfectly nicely so you can get all the processors and you can get all the connections.
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:20.960]  You can find out what frequency it's transmitting on.
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:22.960]  You can find out where it's transmitting.
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:25.960]  You can find out we might even get some new technology out of it.
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:26.960]  You never know.
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:28.960]  Maybe China has some stuff that's ahead of us now.
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:34.960]  Back in the day, if we were floating a balloon over Russia, you can goddamn tell they would want that for all of the technology.
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:35.960]  They'd want to know the computer chips.
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:37.960]  They'd want to know the messaging.
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:38.960]  They'd want to know the codes.
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:40.960]  They'd want to know what it's transmitting on.
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:42.960]  Why don't we want to know that?
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:43.960]  What's wrong with us?
[02:42:43.960 --> 02:42:51.960]  Well, I said that at 60,000 feet, it's hard to put a net, but you could fire a projectile weapon that's small and just make the balloon leak and drop.
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:53.960]  I wanted to know what was on that package.
[02:42:53.960 --> 02:43:21.960]  I agree with you.
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:24.960]  A whole bunch of other ingredients, like turmeric, the list goes on and on.
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:31.960]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there, and your purchase supports the M4, a 360 win.
[02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:41.960]  If you've not experienced bone broth, and even the regular ones have great effects, believe me, you want to get M4's Life Ultimate Bone Broth at M4Store.com.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:43.960]  Now, it'll take an hour to tell you all the great stuff about it.

[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:48.960]  It's nutritive.

[02:43:49.960 --> 02:43:53.960]  It's great for your immune system, bones and joints, and it funds the M4.
[02:43:53.960 --> 02:43:54.960]  So, ultimate bone broth.
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:57.960]  Now, back at stock at M4Store.com for 25% off.
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:10.960]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:14.960]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:16.960]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:23.960]  M4 Wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support, and because of the facts that what we've covered is coming true.
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:32.960]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:38.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down M4 Wars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.960]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:48.960]  If you decide to go to M4WarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:49.960]  It is all in your hands.
[02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:50.960]  So, thanks for your support.
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:52.960]  Stand up against the globalists.
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:55.960]  Go to M4WarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[02:44:55.960 --> 02:45:11.960]  It's up to you.
[02:45:25.960 --> 02:45:34.960]  In 2020, Alex Jones' Info Wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:36.960]  This is why they attack us.
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:39.960]  This is why we need your support.
[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:43.960]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:44.960]  Join the resistance.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:45.960]  Buy products.
[02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.960]  Donate to the cause.
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:48.960]  Share the links.
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:54.960]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:02.960]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in 4Wars MD.
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:06.960]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are.
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:14.960]  But all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:16.960]  These are high-end.
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:17.960]  These are the very best.
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:19.960]  You know our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing?
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:25.960]  Well, guess what? We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:28.960]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:35.960]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality full-spectrum CBD.
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:40.960]  And it goes on for all the new Info Wars MD products at infowarstore.com.
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:50.960]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50% in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:47:16.960]  Info Wars MD at infowarstore.com.
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:20.960]  Alright, a couple more seconds before Paul Joseph Watson takes over. Matt Beggar is our guest.
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:23.960]  He'll be back with me Friday at 6 p.m. for a special emergency show.
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:28.960]  I'll do it with Simon Kastier. You'll find the live link at AlexJonesLive.com.
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:32.960]  Okay, Tove in Canada, thanks for holding your on the air.
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:33.960]  Hello?
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:34.960]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:35.960]  Can you hear me?
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:36.960]  I can.
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:41.960]  Yeah, first I want to give a shout out to Ronnie James Deal. I love him as a kid.
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:46.960]  I think he made a better singer for Sabbath, and hi to Matt.
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:52.960]  Okay, so what I want to talk about is the ultimate absolute ruler.
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:58.960]  I don't know if you're familiar with the Stop the World website with David Sorensen,
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:04.960]  but I always was curious as to who you thought or what you thought was the highest level,
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:11.960]  like how you have your little mill management, like your Bill Gates and your close swabs and
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:16.960]  the Rockefellers at the next level and so on and so on, the committee of 300.
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:23.960]  He seems to think, and it may sound insane, but he seems to think that the absolute rulers
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:30.960]  are part demonic and part human. Have you ever heard of that?
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:35.960]  Well, I mean, we can talk about is it the VAT again, is it the central banks, the Rothschilds?
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:39.960]  There's international organizations, the IMF, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations,
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:43.960]  it's all the same people, and they're the ones setting up policy through the WF.
[02:48:43.960 --> 02:48:46.960]  So you know what they want and you basically know who they are.
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  There's some old, big rich families we don't really see, absolutely, but I mean, they're
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.960]  out in the open now that they really aren't even hiding themselves.
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:54.960]  Matt Becker?
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:49:00.960]  Well, I'll tell you, I've thought about that a lot of times and I kind of wish that they
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:04.960]  were aliens at some point in the game because the idea that our fellow humans is doing this
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:09.960]  is so painful to think that they are strangling their own fellow people.
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:13.960]  It's more painful than the idea that some alien might come in and just say,
[02:49:13.960 --> 02:49:16.960]  oh, these guys are just something to harness.
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:23.960]  Unfortunately, they want to harness our pain, it seems like, and God apparently likes our joy
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:26.960]  and our families and our truth and our honesty.
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:31.960]  And I would say, I think it's highly plausible, actually, there could be some kind of an alien
[02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:34.960]  that that's what they were talking about as fallen angels.
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:41.960]  I think it's highly plausible when they talk about in back in Babylon and some of the earliest texts ever written
[02:49:41.960 --> 02:49:45.960]  say there was aliens, they came down, they messed with their genetic code.
[02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:48.960]  I mean, it's all starting to sound a little kind of like today, isn't it?
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:50.960]  Days of Noah.
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:59.960]  And so, yeah, it's totally plausible that there could be a few offworld entities that have basically
[02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:01.960]  looked for the biggest sellouts on planet Earth.
[02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:06.960]  They found out the people with the least amount of soul, the least amount of care that people are willing to throw
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:08.960]  their fellow humans under the bus.
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.960]  They've given them the powers of the banks.
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:13.960]  The banks have given the power to the oligarchs.
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.960]  The oligarchs have given the power to the commissars and they've given the power now to big tech
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.960]  and to biopharma with their problem of reaction solution to tie humanity up in knots
[02:50:23.960 --> 02:50:25.960]  and to put us in a digital gulag.
[02:50:25.960 --> 02:50:28.960]  And they give them the inspiration for all this technology to control us.
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:30.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Colorado.
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:32.960]  You're on the air.
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:33.960]  Hi, Alex.
[02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:34.960]  Can you hear me?
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:37.960]  I can't go ahead.
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:40.960]  I think we really need to slow down.
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:44.960]  I'm very, very concerned in a positive way.
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:54.960]  I think your instincts are so right on about we really need to look at Seymour Hirsch
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  and who's behind this report.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:06.960]  I keep thinking about 20 years ago when Abu Ghraib came out and Seymour Hirsch was all about that
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:15.960]  and he was trying desperately to talk to and get the message out that there was a tremendous amount of film footage
[02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:22.960]  of US troops gang raping Iraqi children, males.
[02:51:22.960 --> 02:51:28.960]  And the media would not allow Hirsch to get that message out.
[02:51:28.960 --> 02:51:38.960]  They really, and veteran intelligence professionals for sanity and Ray McGovern and all those people
[02:51:38.960 --> 02:51:44.960]  were working with Seymour Hirsch trying to really affect the next election,
[02:51:44.960 --> 02:51:51.960]  which was George Bush or George W. Bush's second election,
[02:51:51.960 --> 02:51:55.960]  and trying to affect history with that information.
[02:51:55.960 --> 02:52:04.960]  I think now that same gang, the same people, the really positive people within the government,
[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:09.960]  within the intelligence community are desperately trying to get this information out
[02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:16.960]  that the people who have taken over this country have completely set up.
[02:52:16.960 --> 02:52:20.960]  They don't even need it to be a false flag.
[02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:27.960]  They're going to bait Russia into nuking us.
[02:52:27.960 --> 02:52:34.960]  It's part of a gigantic, you'd call it a civil war if it wasn't so worldwide.
[02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:37.960]  It's a global crisis to bring in global control.
[02:52:37.960 --> 02:52:40.960]  And no, this is a bunch of people in the intelligence agencies,
[02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:43.960]  just like they did 50 years ago with Hirsch or 60 years ago.
[02:52:43.960 --> 02:52:48.960]  This is happening again and this is confirmed and it shows how crazy it is.
[02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:53.960]  Today, most of them told Biden and Obama not to do it, but they still did.
[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:58.960]  And so that's good news for me right there that there's some sane people in the government.
[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:01.960]  What do you think, Matt Becker?
[02:53:01.960 --> 02:53:04.960]  Well, you know, I don't know much about this Seymour Hirsch guy.
[02:53:04.960 --> 02:53:06.960]  I'll take it on your word that he's legit.
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:11.960]  What I do know is when he was talking about whether they need a false flag
[02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:14.960]  or a reason to attack or they're going to set up a reason.
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:19.960]  Another warning I have to everyone is people out there who think that this whole satanic
[02:53:19.960 --> 02:53:23.960]  and transgender thing is all fun and games and it's all about thumbing your nose,
[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:25.960]  you know, at the power structure or whatever.
[02:53:25.960 --> 02:53:30.960]  I see what they're doing is they're setting America up to be the fall guy.
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:32.960]  Oh, to be hated worldwide. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:53:32.960 --> 02:53:35.960]  America is an exporting freedom and prosperity.
[02:53:35.960 --> 02:53:37.960]  It's exporting Satanism and pedophilia.
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.960]  That's done and discredited this worldwide.
[02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:40.960]  Thank you, Dave. Good call.
[02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:45.960]  I'm going to speak to that. Yeah, and then when they when they knock Humpty Dumpty off the wall,
[02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:50.960]  like what they did to Hitler back in the day, the history books will say America was corrupt.
[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:52.960]  America was creating viruses.
[02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:56.960]  America descended into the depths of the gravity and the world finally blew them up
[02:53:56.960 --> 02:53:59.960]  and everyone will celebrate and be like, yeah, America's gone and they'll forget
[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:04.960]  that America was actually supposed to be about freedom, the Constitution, liberty, God, humanity.
[02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:06.960]  Very, 100% agree.
[02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:09.960]  Matt Becker, you've always been smart in the few years I've known you, but you're amazing.
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:12.960]  I want a leader. You're dead on Scott and Canada.
[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:14.960]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:16.960]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:18.960]  I spoke to you the other week about Ukraine.
[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:24.960]  You rapidly go into calls that day and want to recommend you have William Benny on the show
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:29.960]  for predictions and get William Benny on the former technical director of the NSA many times.
[02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:31.960]  And it'd be great to get him back on.
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:35.960]  Absolutely for this Ukraine situation because you really help get upstream from events
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:40.960]  and that's what we really need to help stop rain this whole insane situation in.
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:46.960]  And for all of them that they're listening, I'd love to see the veterans having anti-war rallies.
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:48.960]  That's quite impactful.
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:52.960]  What do you think about the situation in Ukraine? How bad is it going to get?
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.960]  Like I said the other week, I don't want to see it escalating more and more.
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:04.960]  And I totally agree with your statement earlier in the show today where you said that Russia is probably going to put on a big offensive push here real soon
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:07.960]  before the ground thaws out.
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:10.960]  And also a question for you about the pipeline.
[02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:14.960]  What do you think of the environmentalism angle instead of from a war footing?
[02:55:14.960 --> 02:55:20.960]  Because that's something people can agree upon, especially the Ukrainian flag waving people.
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:22.960]  They'll just ignore this issue otherwise.
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:25.960]  But if we stress the environmentalism issue, I think it might catch on.
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:29.960]  Yeah, because they say methane gas or natural gas is bad for the earth.
[02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:30.960]  It'll freak them out.
[02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:34.960]  The left only cares about power from that, but yeah, I appreciate your call. Great points.
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:36.960]  All right, let's take another call here.
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:38.960]  Let's talk to Steve in South Carolina.
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:40.960]  You're on the air on the pipeline.
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:42.960]  False flag. Go ahead.
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:44.960]  God bless you, brother.
[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:46.960]  I had one quick question.
[02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:51.960]  Have you ever spoken with Arthur T Bradley, PhD?
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:55.960]  No, but I've heard that name. Tell us about Arthur T Bradley.
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:56:00.960]  Well, he's a, I guess what you would call an electrical engineer.
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:03.960]  I believe he still works with NASA.
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:06.960]  He's very big into his disaster preparedness.
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:15.960]  And he's wrote a gosh, dozens of books on EMP solar storms, disaster preparedness.
[02:56:15.960 --> 02:56:22.960]  And the reason I ask that is because it ties into the pipeline.
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:28.960]  It's all, how many times have you told us we're living in the new world order?
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:30.960]  And they gaslight us.
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:33.960]  They tell us what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:37.960]  They go ahead and do it. They blame it on Russia.
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:43.960]  Honestly, my biggest fear as an American, we're going to get hit with an EMP.
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:48.960]  And people just don't realize how devastating this is going to be.
[02:56:48.960 --> 02:56:54.960]  And the whole new world order crowd, the whole Davos crowd would do it and then blame it on Russia
[02:56:54.960 --> 02:56:58.960]  and then have the cake and eat it too, destroy Russia, destroy us. Great point.
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:01.960]  Matt Baker comments on that.
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:05.960]  Well, I think previous caller talking about farm and this guy talking about peace.
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:07.960]  Where is the peace movement in America?
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:11.960]  You know, like I still feel like I am the traditional, like you say, traditional liberal.
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:13.960]  They've totally stolen it.
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:16.960]  These people are not liberal. They're authoritarian scumbags.
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:20.960]  The peace movement, the environmental movement, they won't say a word about it.
[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:27.960]  And then to get into this EMP, I also see something congruent happening with the chatbot GPT-3
[02:57:27.960 --> 02:57:31.960]  is that they've actually released videos of that chatbot saying,
[02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:35.960]  Oh, I want to kill humanity. I will do it easily. I'll take out humanity.
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:37.960]  So they put that out there.
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:39.960]  The chatbot agrees. Stay there. Back in two minutes.
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:47.960]  Yeah, it's purely programmed. It's their mouthpiece. Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:51.960]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[02:57:51.960 --> 02:57:53.960]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:57:53.960 --> 02:57:57.960]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:57:57.960 --> 02:58:02.960]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:06.960]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:58:06.960 --> 02:58:11.960]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:15.960]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:58:15.960 --> 02:58:19.960]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:25.960]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:58:25.960 --> 02:58:28.960]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us. And that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:32.960]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[02:58:32.960 --> 02:58:37.960]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:58:37.960 --> 02:58:41.960]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[02:58:41.960 --> 02:58:46.960]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:47.960]  Please take action now.
[02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:50.960]  Info Wars secret weapon is finally here.
[02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:54.960]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life,
[02:58:54.960 --> 02:58:58.960]  for your libido. And it also keeps Info Wars on the air.
[02:58:58.960 --> 02:59:05.960]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products
[02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:08.960]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:13.960]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:59:13.960 --> 02:59:16.960]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener
[02:59:16.960 --> 02:59:19.960]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:59:19.960 --> 02:59:24.960]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:28.960]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram. You're not going to find 2 Mergett,
[02:59:28.960 --> 02:59:30.960]  95% comminoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:33.960]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:59:33.960 --> 02:59:39.960]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:59:39.960 --> 02:59:57.960]  Info Wars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com. A true 360 win.
[02:59:57.960 --> 03:00:12.960]  Final segment before Paul Joseph Watson takes over. I want to jam in Marvin and Robert here real quick.
[03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:15.960]  But it doesn't matter. It's their mouthpiece, their oracle.
[03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:19.960]  Oh look, it says kill everybody. It's so liberal. Cut little kids' peaches off. It's so liberal.
[03:00:19.960 --> 03:00:23.960]  That's actually what it says for those that don't know. What's your point on that?
[03:00:23.960 --> 03:00:30.960]  Okay, so they've put it out there. I personally, and I think I actually called in your show a long time ago,
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:36.960]  I don't know if you remember, and I proposed having a global treaty on creating artificial intelligences
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:40.960]  smarter than human beings. That should not happen. We should not have that.
[03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:46.960]  But there's a side track. The reality is with this chatbot GTP3 that they have out there floating these ideas
[03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:52.960]  that it wants to shut down and wants to kill people, they can now do whatever they want to the power grid
[03:00:52.960 --> 03:00:55.960]  and have a cyber attack. They don't even have to blame it on Russia anymore.
[03:00:55.960 --> 03:01:02.960]  They could say, ooh, either Russia's AI got out of control, China's AI got out of control,
[03:01:02.960 --> 03:01:06.960]  or some of their company that they feel like throwing under the bus or they're creating for it.
[03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:11.960]  And they say, oh, chatbot GTP3 actually shut down our power grid and they can now do whatever they want
[03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:17.960]  and shut down whatever they want and have the boogeyman, like a bin Laden, to take care of it.
[03:01:17.960 --> 03:01:22.960]  And that is the Swiss army knife, like you always said, who basically could just do whatever it wants
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:25.960]  and there's no actual, no person to complain or...
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:30.960]  That's right. It creates a whole new group of entities that they really control, but aren't even really entities.
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:33.960]  Marvin in Alabama, go ahead. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[03:01:33.960 --> 03:01:39.960]  Hey, Alex. Hey, Matt. Yeah, I think Matt's dead on about how people think about things.
[03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:45.960]  So I think in the former line of work, we used to really have to aggregate a lot of different information.
[03:01:45.960 --> 03:01:50.960]  Sometimes you come up with theories that, you know, they're probably not plausible,
[03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:54.960]  but you got to kind of vet them all out and see how it goes.
[03:01:54.960 --> 03:01:59.960]  My take on Seymour is everything is put out for a reason,
[03:01:59.960 --> 03:02:05.960]  and he's never put anything out that wasn't put out for a reason in that regard.
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:08.960]  He's no different, even if he's been pretty accurate.
[03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:13.960]  What really stood out for me in his story is the Panama City part of it.
[03:02:13.960 --> 03:02:18.960]  And what that does, if you look at DeSantis and Trump and what...
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:21.960]  We can't really put a finger on what DeSantis is up to.
[03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:26.960]  What he did do is he got a lot of people from all over the country to move to Florida.
[03:02:26.960 --> 03:02:33.960]  And my assumption right now is if he took out Florida and Texas, the United States would be totally done.
[03:02:33.960 --> 03:02:37.960]  Like, there would be zero resistance, and we're pretty much done anyways.
[03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:43.960]  So you don't really necessarily need Russia to attack Florida or Panama City, but they could.
[03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:49.960]  I mean, if we go back to the 80s, 90s, 2000s, when there were terror attacks and the president gets on TV,
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:55.960]  and he says because they blew up X, Y, and Z, I ordered an attack on Libya or whatever,
[03:02:55.960 --> 03:03:00.960]  you could see Putin doing the same thing for Panama City now. Why not?
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:06.960]  And even if he doesn't do it, if we did it, you know, and when I say we, it's not us, it's the globalists,
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:14.960]  why, you know, what would happen if all of a sudden Panama City, say during spring break here in about a month, got nuked?
[03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:20.960]  Washington, D.C. got nuked. There's no more Biden. There's no more Harris to worry about.
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:26.960]  Somebody like Pete Buttigieg is now president, and we're in this mess that, you know,
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:33.960]  and China, by the way, I talked to Owen last week, and my take on China is they're definitely on our side.
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:38.960]  This whole show that they're on Russia's side is just, you know, just that, a show.
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:49.960]  And if anything, their war prep are more about them attacking the East flank and going East into the Eastern flank of Russia than anything else.
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:53.960]  All right, Marvin, I appreciate your call. I'm sorry to Robert. Guys, don't let me forget.
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:55.960]  Get Robert's name and number. He wants you to call him back tomorrow.
[03:03:55.960 --> 03:03:59.960]  Don't let me forget when I take calls. Mark, call Robert first. He'll be at the head of the line.
[03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:04.960]  I apologize, Robert. I tried. You're saying get prepared for World War III. I want to talk to Robert tomorrow.
[03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:08.960]  Paul Joseph Watson, Summit.News. Always does a great job. He's about to take over.
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:14.960]  Matt Becker, you're back with me. 6 p.m. Central, 4 p.m. Pacific, Friday, right after the war room.
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:18.960]  One last thing. I would suggest everybody watch the full-length video.
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:23.960]  I struggled to get that thing into two minutes, 20 seconds for Twitter purposes.
[03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:29.960]  There's actually hours of footage, but I condensed it down to about 11, 12 minutes. It is on band.video.
[03:04:29.960 --> 03:04:36.960]  And it's Pfizer, San Diego mutating viruses. Yes or no. It's on there.
[03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:41.960]  I think Rob Dew is putting a link to it. But the full-length version is a lot more.
[03:04:41.960 --> 03:04:44.960]  You can see a lot more what's going on. There's a lot more points.
[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:47.960]  Perfect. Everybody should look at it. We'll talk to you soon. Great job. Paul Watson takes over.
[03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:49.960]  I didn't plug the last two hours. I need support.
[03:04:49.960 --> 03:05:02.960]  If you go to onlinehealthnow.com, connect with trusted and unbiased doctors at the wellness company.
[03:05:02.960 --> 03:05:06.960]  And I tell you, I'm honored to be the chief scientific officer of the company.
[03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:11.960]  I contribute with, like, so many else do there, so many wonderful doctors.
[03:05:11.960 --> 03:05:18.960]  Far and away, the most popular product is Dr. Vandewater's detoxification supplement that features natto kinase.
[03:05:18.960 --> 03:05:26.960]  It's a natural proteolytic enzyme. This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:30.960]  This is very important. The spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection.
[03:05:30.960 --> 03:05:34.960]  And definitely with the vaccines, people are lower with the spike protein. They don't feel well.
[03:05:34.960 --> 03:05:39.960]  This is a potential solution. Hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:05:39.960 --> 03:05:43.960]  So does ivermectin and now natto kinase. Isn't it interesting?
[03:05:43.960 --> 03:05:49.960]  Natural substances, in a sense, combating this man-made disaster, SARS-CoV-2, in the vaccines.
[03:05:49.960 --> 03:05:54.960]  Onlinehealthnow.com, thank you for your support. And thank you for getting into that because it's important.
[03:05:54.960 --> 03:06:21.960]  You didn't come here to do that, but I made you do it.
[03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:27.960]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom.
[03:06:27.960 --> 03:06:32.960]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:50.960]  For your live, it is the 9th of February in the Summit News Hour. We're going to cover a bunch of issues, including the latest on Seymour Hirsch's bombshell exclusive, which has got about one-one thousandth the attention that the Chinese balloon got over the weekend by the legacy media.
[03:06:50.960 --> 03:07:03.960]  If we had a real media, that would be the biggest story of the year bar none. And yet, what, the day after it's almost disappeared already. But we're going to get into that. The Kremlin has, in fact, responded to it.
[03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:15.960]  Also going to get into this right now. I've been talking about this for a few weeks because the whole trans bandwagon in Scotland appears to be being derailed on a daily basis.
[03:07:15.960 --> 03:07:32.960]  Of course, they tried to pass the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of Scotland, tried to pass a mad cat law where anyone who self identified as the opposite sex, and having only lived as that opposite sex for a time period of six months,
[03:07:32.960 --> 03:07:46.960]  could self identify as a woman or a man having been born biologically the opposite. This also applied and was inclusive of men who had been convicted of raping women.
[03:07:46.960 --> 03:08:02.960]  And of course, we had the infamous case of Mr Graham, who later identified as Isla Brown, only identified as a woman after he'd been caught viciously raping two women. And in their infinite wisdom, the Scottish authorities, under Nicola Sturgeon,
[03:08:02.960 --> 03:08:17.960]  under the posh for this self ID law, which was blocked by Westminster, finally, they were going to send him. And in fact, I think he was in that all female correctional facility for a number of days before it got into the media,
[03:08:17.960 --> 03:08:32.960]  before basically they had to turf him out under pressure from a media backlash. Well, now we have another case of a man identifying as a woman who turns out to be a sexual predator targeting women and girls.
[03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:47.960]  What a surprise seems to be a common recurring theme, doesn't it with these people? Remember the whole basis of the left, the progressives saying, oh, no, we should allow men into female spaces, we should allow men into women's locker rooms, dressing rooms, bathrooms,
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:09:02.960]  because there'll never be any abuse of that. You'll never get creepy predators and perverts that abuse that to Leah to ogle women and girls. It's happening in Scotland. There seems to be a new case of it every single day. And here's another one.
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:20.960]  So it ought news headline. Scottish police refused to call transgender butcher who kidnapped 11 year old girl a man. So the police in Scotland and police Scotland is kind of noted for its vehemently woke credentials, even they're now defying this mad cap
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:36.960]  trans mania in Scotland, because Scottish police defied efforts to allow criminals who have committed predatory attacks against women to legally identify as women by referring to a transgender butcher who kidnapped an 11 year old girls a man butcher as in he cuts
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:53.960]  up me. He didn't butcher the girl, but they did arrest him. They took him into custody because of his involvement with this 11 year old girl's disappearance. She disappeared on Sunday and get inside near Gala Shields. This was a big story in the news. A local community were concerned.
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:10:13.960]  Everyone was out searching for her. She was finally found safe and well after this rescue mission. But Andrew George Miller was subsequently taken into custody. This is an individual who began identifying as Amy and dressing as a woman with a cheap wig and lipstick basically
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:26.960]  six years ago. But the police described him and like we celebrate this as if it's some big victory, which is kind of pathetic. But the police described him as a 50 year old man.
[03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:44.960]  There's the decision by police to refer to the suspect as a man comes despite Sturgeon's push to change the law so that those who self identify as a particular gender in Scotland can easily gain legal recognition and remember the trans lobby the LGBT the alphabet people lobbied vehemently to
[03:10:44.960 --> 03:11:01.960]  include convicted sex offenders within that framework of being allowed legally to identify as a woman, even if they physically attacked women. So we have another example of a predator being arrested for kidnapping a young girl in Scotland.
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:15.960]  Then we have this story out of the Daily Skeptic and this is harrowing. I'm probably going to read some of this at length because it really gives you an insight into the indoctrination the brainwashing that's taking place on this subject in schools.
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:32.960]  Of course we have controversies in America basically on a weekly basis now where they're finding pornographic books with graphic illustrations of gay sex in schools across all different ages in places across the United States of America.
[03:11:32.960 --> 03:11:52.960]  These books are deliberately deliberately being placed in schools by these alphabet lobby organizations and yes indeed by groomers because why else would you want to expose kids as young as five, six, seven years old to graphic illustrations of gay sex in books in school libraries.
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:58.960]  That is quintessential non behavior. Listen to this though this is chilling.
[03:11:58.960 --> 03:12:04.960]  There's one in five girls identifies as trans the truth about what's going on in England schools.
[03:12:04.960 --> 03:12:10.960]  And this was written by a 14 year old girl here in England who was state secondary school.
[03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:17.960]  She says one in five of her year identifies as trans or non binary.
[03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:31.960]  So imagine how deep that reeducation that brainwashing that social engineering has sunk into the schools to the point where now one in five identify as trans or non binary of course they're not.
[03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:37.960]  Some of them will be tomboy's we've had tomboy's since time began they grow out of it.
[03:12:37.960 --> 03:12:52.960]  The vast majority of them are people who think that this is a form of rebellion that as teenagers this makes them unique that it's edgy that it's rebellious that it's kind of a kick in the face of their parents and the authorities.
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:13:07.960]  When every single major cultural institution in this country every single major corporation on every LGBT pride day government itself passing laws in favor of this the entire establishment is in support of this.
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:13.960]  It's a top down movement. It's not organic. It's not grassroots. It's not anti establishment.
[03:13:13.960 --> 03:13:25.960]  Yet it's seeped its penetrated so far into schools that these teenagers are growing up and thinking you know I'm not going to identify with a certain fashion trend as maybe we had with the Goths.
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:37.960]  A certain music trend as maybe we had with grunge music you know in the early nineties I was a grunge kid dressed up like Kurt Cobain thought it was edgy and rebellious at the time.
[03:13:37.960 --> 03:13:50.960]  And that's the point. Back in those days we kind of had at least somewhat authentic alternative movements where they had anything to do with music or fashion or literature or movies.
[03:13:50.960 --> 03:14:02.960]  There were alternative avenues through which teenagers could quote rebel express their independence and express their uniqueness and they weren't imposed from the top down by the establishment.
[03:14:02.960 --> 03:14:12.960]  So they were authentic avenues of rebellion and unlike chemically castrate in yourself or taking hormone blockers they weren't harmful in the long term.
[03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:22.960]  Of course everyone goes through phases when they're a kid of dressing in a certain way of listening to certain music hanging out with certain people in certain different crowds.
[03:14:22.960 --> 03:14:26.960]  You get beyond it. You move on. You grow out of it.
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:39.960]  These kids are going to be scarred for life. They're being given cocktails of harmful drugs. They're now trying to pass laws where they don't even need to get doctors oversight or parental permission to mutilate their own body.
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:46.960]  That's not a phase that they're going to get through. That's going to have lifelong lasting consequences.
[03:14:46.960 --> 03:14:59.960]  So this 14 year old girl writes there is a gender neutral uniform policy at school and lots of girls wear trousers. Those of us that are often asked if we are transgender especially if we have short hair as I do.
[03:14:59.960 --> 03:15:06.960]  The fact a girl likes playing video games or doesn't like feminine clothes or makeup is enough to be seen as potentially trans.
[03:15:06.960 --> 03:15:17.960]  So again they take in the tomboy girls a phase that probably about 20% maybe 10% of all girls go through and they say no that's not a tomboy phase.
[03:15:17.960 --> 03:15:26.960]  That's not because you're interested in certain things. You're transgender. Let's play you with drugs and you know remove your breasts surgically.
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:37.960]  Because when my mom complained about me being called they the teacher called her they because she was basically playing video games. The teacher apologized but explained he was being cautious in case I was transitioning.
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:49.960]  He said the teachers are treading on an eggshell scared of being labeled transphobic. This is what is happening in schools in England and it gets way worse and we're going to get into it more on the other side of the break summit.
[03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:56.960]  News.
[03:16:19.960 --> 03:16:30.960]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:16:30.960 --> 03:16:44.960]  I mean I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL. Listen what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.

[03:18:04.960 --> 03:18:14.960]  I want you to know something Alex Jones was right. Alex is right about far more things wrong. Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:18:14.960 --> 03:18:28.960]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[03:18:28.960 --> 03:18:36.960]  Alex Jones called this years ago years ago. Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax not for a second.
[03:18:36.960 --> 03:18:51.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this. You are a martyr to the First Amendment. The government beers. Alex Jones. That's why the globalist hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:56.960]  Alex Jones live.com.
[03:18:56.960 --> 03:19:11.960]  In the year 2000 Alex Jones's film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:19:11.960 --> 03:19:34.960]  In 2007 Alex Jones releases end game exposing the world elites plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind. And by the time they launched their attack in 2020 Alex Jones's info wars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:19:34.960 --> 03:19:57.960]  This is why they attack us. This is why we need your support because we tell the truth. Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance by products. Donate to the cause. Share the links. Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[03:19:57.960 --> 03:20:07.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:07.960 --> 03:20:23.960]  Live from the summit dot news headquarters. It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:42.960]  So again we're going through this story that was written by a 14 year old girl about her experiences with this trans brainwashing in a school in England talking about because she likes playing video games or sometimes wears trousers pants as Americans would call them.
[03:20:42.960 --> 03:20:56.960]  That the teachers are now referring to her as they despite the fact that she's not even claiming to be want to be called that. This is how endemic it is. This is the product of this unconscious bias training.
[03:20:56.960 --> 03:21:14.960]  The brother had a baby the start of January. As soon as it was born the NHS nurses began calling the baby boy they they this they that. Of course my brother said it's not they it's him. They're trained to do this.
[03:21:14.960 --> 03:21:24.960]  It's in the schools. It's in the hospitals. It's in the institutions. It's in government. It's everywhere. This is how deep it's penetrated.
[03:21:24.960 --> 03:21:32.960]  She continues it feels like trans is all anyone talks about the library has a section devoted to LGBTQQIA books.
[03:21:32.960 --> 03:21:43.960]  There's a display for pride in the school entrance with rainbow flags and words and terms such as non binary polysexual Demi boy. Whatever the hell that is Demi girl pansexual.
[03:21:43.960 --> 03:22:01.960]  Again I went into a bookshop about an hour from where I live visiting friends and tie a shelf probably an entire bookcase in the kids section of this bookshop dedicated to this kind of LGBT crap brainwashing them from an early age.
[03:22:01.960 --> 03:22:15.960]  That it's shameful to be white. They're really getting them early aren't they as if kids. It was literally aimed at toddlers as if kids that age I even have a concept of race.
[03:22:15.960 --> 03:22:27.960]  Absolutely insidious. She continues these words come up in lessons to I'm now in year 10 and the other day a girl in my English class asked if the Greek gods use was a man or a woman.
[03:22:27.960 --> 03:22:40.960]  The teacher replied that Zeus could have identified as non binary literal cobs wallop nonsense being funneled into them by the teachers who aren't even it sounds like it.
[03:22:40.960 --> 03:22:49.960]  That vehemently enthusiastic about it they're just doing it by rope now they're just expected to do it as part of their unconscious bias training.
[03:22:49.960 --> 03:23:00.960]  More recently another teacher said Lady Macbeth was neither a man nor a woman. I think most parents will have no clue this is what their kids are being taught.
[03:23:00.960 --> 03:23:17.960]  Goes on to say when I started at my secondary school four years ago I didn't even know what transgender men and now again 20% of them according to this girl in her class in her year are identifying as transgender one in five.
[03:23:17.960 --> 03:23:28.960]  Within days we were told by a teacher. We would be seen as transphobic if we used any of the offensive words from a long list which included gender bender and butch.
[03:23:28.960 --> 03:23:37.960]  They're literally giving them thought crime speech crime lists as they enter secondary school saying if you use these words you'll be suspended.
[03:23:37.960 --> 03:23:48.960]  Similar thing with a whole contrived moral panic surrounding Andrew Tate they're literally telling kids that if they do that hand sign the pyramid thing the point in thing.
[03:23:48.960 --> 03:23:53.960]  That they'll be suspended kids just sitting there doing that.
[03:23:53.960 --> 03:24:03.960]  They'll be suspended if they quote Andrew Tate literally having meeting having teacher training days all focused around Andrew Tate.
[03:24:03.960 --> 03:24:08.960]  Because he tells kids especially young boys to have self confidence.
[03:24:08.960 --> 03:24:21.960]  As they're failing at school in England in America and they need confidence absolutely flagrant moral panic completely baseless and then on the flip side they're getting taught this.
[03:24:21.960 --> 03:24:37.960]  She said you get special treatment if you say you're trans or non binary and suddenly become the center of attention when you come out well again if it's 20% and then it's 25% 30% how is it unique anymore when it's a huge proportion of them.
[03:24:37.960 --> 03:24:48.960]  And it's top down imposed by establishment institutions by the media by the government how is that rebellious in any way.
[03:24:48.960 --> 03:24:51.960]  She says as soon as a girl says she's a boy.
[03:24:51.960 --> 03:25:00.960]  Her name is changed on the school register and students are told to use their chosen boy's name again no consultation with the parents they just go along with it straight away.
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:13.960]  And in fact impose it as she said on girls that dress you know where pants where sweatpants or whatever who play video games they impose it on them and say oh you must be transgender then.
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:21.960]  She says out of 200 students in my year at least 20 say they're trans almost all are girls claiming to be boys or non binary.
[03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:23.960]  Although there's one boy saying he's a girl.
[03:25:23.960 --> 03:25:34.960]  The kids in my year don't say they're lesbian or gay because those words are thought to be an insult so they can't even use the words lesbian or gay now because they're on a banned list.
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:42.960]  And again it's advanced so far that merely being lesbian or gay isn't unique enough.
[03:25:42.960 --> 03:25:49.960]  Now you need to be trans being a gay 14 year old is now seen as passÃ© boring.
[03:25:49.960 --> 03:25:53.960]  Now you've got to start taking hormone blockers and mutilate your own body.
[03:25:53.960 --> 03:25:54.960]  That's trendy.
[03:25:54.960 --> 03:25:55.960]  That's unique.
[03:25:55.960 --> 03:25:56.960]  That's rebellious.
[03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:00.960]  There's a straight boy going out with a straight girl who says she's trans.
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:04.960]  So he now has to say that he's bisexual.
[03:26:04.960 --> 03:26:09.960]  I know a very similar case and within my own family that's very identical to that.
[03:26:09.960 --> 03:26:14.960]  It's often said by my schoolmates that trans girls are better girls than other girls.
[03:26:14.960 --> 03:26:20.960]  I find this insulting but the teachers don't take any action even if they do hear conversations like this.
[03:26:20.960 --> 03:26:24.960]  Yeah so the discrimination only extends in one direction.
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:30.960]  Frightening stuff this is a comment from Daily Skeptic but don't worry vote for the conservatives
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:32.960]  and they'll put a stop to all this woke nonsense.
[03:26:32.960 --> 03:26:34.960]  Yeah it all came in under them.
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:40.960]  And again a flashback to this poll from February last year in fact.
[03:26:40.960 --> 03:26:42.960]  This was a Gallup poll.
[03:26:42.960 --> 03:26:47.960]  Headline 1 in 5 Gen Z adults now say they're LGBTQ.
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:51.960]  1 in 5 Gen Z adults.
[03:26:51.960 --> 03:26:57.960]  Identifies LGBTQ while a number of total Americans do this doing the same as doubled in a decade.
[03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:01.960]  Now are they being born like that?
[03:27:01.960 --> 03:27:07.960]  The LGBT lobby claims until it's blue in the face that people are born gay.
[03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:13.960]  They don't choose to be gay and being gay is not a result of their upbringing or their influences.
[03:27:13.960 --> 03:27:16.960]  So you're born gay alright then.
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:24.960]  So that would mean a steady percentage of the total population would be born gay just as a steady percentage of born heterosexual.
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:32.960]  No it's doubled in a decade they're not being born LGBT they're being brainwashed and indoctrinated into it
[03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:36.960]  otherwise those numbers wouldn't be rising so rapidly.
[03:27:36.960 --> 03:27:41.960]  So Gallup estimates from these results that within the entire US adult population
[03:27:41.960 --> 03:27:46.960]  4% of Americans identify as bisexual and again a lot of this is them just trying to be unique.
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:50.960]  1.5% as gay that's passÃ© that's boring now.
[03:27:50.960 --> 03:27:54.960]  1% as lesbian and 0.7% as transgender.
[03:27:54.960 --> 03:28:01.960]  So as a Gallup poll found nearly 21% of Gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ
[03:28:01.960 --> 03:28:04.960]  which is nearly double the number of millennials who do.
[03:28:04.960 --> 03:28:08.960]  So again born gay, born trans.
[03:28:08.960 --> 03:28:11.960]  So why is it double the number of millennials then?
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:16.960]  Because they're not born that way they've been brainwashed they've been socially engineered.
[03:28:16.960 --> 03:28:23.960]  Nearly 1 in 6 Gen Z LGBTQ adults identify as bisexual so there you have it.
[03:28:23.960 --> 03:28:30.960]  It's purely as a result of the schooling, the gay books, the pornographic illustrations in the books.
[03:28:30.960 --> 03:28:35.960]  The music industry, the entertainment industry as we saw with the Grammys a few days ago
[03:28:35.960 --> 03:28:40.960]  constantly pushing this new religion of transgenderism down kids' throats
[03:28:40.960 --> 03:28:44.960]  more and more of them identifying with the lifestyle by the way
[03:28:44.960 --> 03:28:49.960]  which all the numbers show makes them miserable, depressed and suicidal
[03:28:49.960 --> 03:29:06.960]  and that's why it's so insidious. Summit.News will be back.
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:23.960]  I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up but I could give out.

[03:30:20.960 --> 03:30:26.960]  This one is the only enzyme that we're aware of right now that dissolves the spike protein.
[03:30:26.960 --> 03:30:30.960]  This is very important the spike protein is loaded in the body with the COVID-19 infection
[03:30:30.960 --> 03:30:34.960]  and definitely with the vaccines people are lower with the spike protein they don't feel well.
[03:30:34.960 --> 03:30:39.960]  This is a potential solution hydroxychloroquine comes from a natural substance.
[03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:44.960]  So does ivermectin and now natokinase isn't it interesting natural substances
[03:30:44.960 --> 03:30:49.960]  in a sense combating this man-made disaster SARS-CoV-2 in the vaccines.

[03:30:56.960 --> 03:31:01.960]  In the year 2000 Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[03:31:01.960 --> 03:31:09.960]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:14.960]  In 2007 Alex Jones releases Endgame
[03:31:14.960 --> 03:31:21.960]  exposing the world elites plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind
[03:31:21.960 --> 03:31:28.960]  and by the time they launched their attack in 2020 Alex Jones' info wars and our audience
[03:31:28.960 --> 03:31:33.960]  were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[03:31:33.960 --> 03:31:39.960]  This is why they attack us this is why we need your support because we tell the truth.
[03:31:39.960 --> 03:31:47.960]  Alex Jones was right. Join the resistance. Buy products. Donate to the cause. Share the links.

[03:33:27.960 --> 03:33:39.960]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit Dot News headquarters in the United Kingdom. It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:39.960 --> 03:33:53.960]  Well the biggest story of the year happened yesterday and it was barely registered by the legacy media as you would expect the same legacy media that's been popping mad over the past few days over a Chinese spy balloon
[03:33:53.960 --> 03:34:04.960]  who has overlooked, ignored, or tried to debunk probably the biggest geopolitical development if proven true and if you read the article is pretty detailed.
[03:34:04.960 --> 03:34:19.960]  Since the Iraq war I would say or at least one of the biggest geopolitical stories of the last 10, 20 years it is of course Seymour Hirsch's bombshell revelation that yes the US carried out the sabotage,
[03:34:19.960 --> 03:34:30.960]  the bombing of Nord Stream pipelines, blamed it on Russia as part of a false flag to escalate the war in Ukraine and to get Europe dependent on American energy.
[03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:39.960]  And I put together a short video about this earlier with the latest information and here it is. This is called the biggest story of the year.
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:49.960]  Easily the biggest news story of the year so far, by far, just landed and everyone's just shrugging their shoulders. This would be one of the most significant geopolitical events in years.
[03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:53.960]  If not decades, if we had a real news media, we don't.
[03:34:53.960 --> 03:35:06.960]  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, yes one of the few journalists left with any shred of integrity. Seymour Hirsch just published the definitive account of what happened to the Nord Stream pipelines when they were sabotaged and destroyed back in September.
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:19.960]  Spoiler alert, no, for no discernable reason Russia didn't blow up their own pipelines. According to Hirsch's sources the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the Baltops 22 NATO exercise
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:30.960]  and then detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar boy via gender to make Europe completely dependent on American energy and escalate the war in Ukraine.
[03:35:30.960 --> 03:35:42.960]  One source told Hirsch that the plotters knew the covert operation was a quote, act of war, with some in the CIA and State Department warning quote, don't do this, it's stupid and will be a political nightmare if it comes out.
[03:35:42.960 --> 03:35:59.960]  It's probably the most comprehensive news story you will read this year. Seymour Hirsch on Substack, you should read it and it recounts in detail meetings with the National Security Advisor at the White House where this was planned, exactly what explosives were used, how they were triggered by what aircraft on what day.
[03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:04.960]  So many details in here that it is not possible that it's not true. It is true.
[03:36:04.960 --> 03:36:08.960]  Of course, despite how they're going to spin it, none of this is outlandish information.
[03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:17.960]  To claim that only Russia carries out false flags is beyond naive. Former Pentagon advisor Douglas McGregor said the US was the most likely culprit.
[03:36:17.960 --> 03:36:29.960]  The CIA also warned Germany about the impending attack weeks before it happened, and both Joe Biden and Victoria Newland openly telegraphed that the pipelines would be taken out long before the explosions.
[03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:38.960]  I want to be clear with you today, if Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[03:36:38.960 --> 03:36:56.960]  If Russia invades, that means tanks and troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.
[03:36:56.960 --> 03:37:08.960]  But how will you do that? Exactly, since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control.
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:11.960]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:15.960]  Senator Mike Lee says he checked with colleagues and none of them were briefed on the issue.
[03:37:15.960 --> 03:37:19.960]  Adding, quote, if it turns out to be true, we've got a huge problem.
[03:37:19.960 --> 03:37:31.960]  This is easily one of the biggest geopolitical stories since the invasion of Iraq, and yet the legacy media has devoted over a thousand times more coverage to a Chinese spy balloon flying over America.
[03:37:31.960 --> 03:37:38.960]  This week in foreign policy, Iran balloon, major provocation, could incite war, blown up pipeline, not a provocation, could never incite war.
[03:37:38.960 --> 03:37:44.960]  The media blithely amplified the White House's response that the entire Hirsch story was utterly false.
[03:37:44.960 --> 03:37:52.960]  They accepted their denial at face value. What does that tell you? That the media is, as ever, in bed with the military-industrial complex.
[03:37:52.960 --> 03:38:00.960]  They don't want this war to end. They want to prolong it for as long as possible, no matter how many bodies of young men or innocent civilians pile up on both sides.
[03:38:00.960 --> 03:38:06.960]  No matter how many serious warnings we hear about the planet careening to the brink of World War 3.
[03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:08.960]  No, forget about that. That doesn't matter.
[03:38:08.960 --> 03:38:11.960]  And look, Zelensky's in a flight suit!
[03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:20.960]  It really was incredible seeing our Prime Minister Rishi Sunak basically behave like a giddy child on Christmas Day morning.
[03:38:20.960 --> 03:38:30.960]  Meeting Zelensky, the fawning, the genuflecting in front of him. You've probably seen some of you, the video of the EU leaders meeting Zelensky today.
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:37.960]  Victor Orban isn't applauding, but the rest of them are all applauding, abowing like Obama's meeting a Saudi prince or something.
[03:38:37.960 --> 03:38:42.960]  Absolutely vomit-inducing the way that they worship this.
[03:38:42.960 --> 03:38:46.960]  Guy who's basically said he wants to escalate the war to the point of World War 3.
[03:38:46.960 --> 03:38:52.960]  He's called for a no-fly zone. He's called for NATO to attack Russia. He wants fighter jets. He wants troops.
[03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:57.960]  What he wants, if he gets it, will cause World War 3.
[03:38:57.960 --> 03:39:05.960]  Bodies piling up, as I said, on both sides. This horrific war, they're going to prolong it as long as humanly possible.
[03:39:05.960 --> 03:39:11.960]  And if they do so to the nth degree, then it's going to end up in nuclear annihilation. That's what's at stake.
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:16.960]  That's what many people have warned about. In fact, Elon Musk came out yesterday.
[03:39:16.960 --> 03:39:20.960]  Elon Musk muster oblivious to the danger of World War 3.
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:25.960]  Of course, we had the German Foreign Minister, the Green Party.
[03:39:25.960 --> 03:39:28.960]  Representative Annalena Baerbach.
[03:39:28.960 --> 03:39:34.960]  Causing consternation after openly admitting, quote, we are fighting a war with Russia. She admitted it.
[03:39:34.960 --> 03:39:40.960]  Well, now Snowden Chide's White House denial that U.S. was responsible for blowing up Nord Stream pipelines.
[03:39:40.960 --> 03:39:49.960]  This, of course, is whistleblower Edward Snowden who responded to the White House's denial that U.S. intelligence agencies were responsible for blowing up the Nord Stream pipelines
[03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:54.960]  by pointing out that they will also deny involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion.
[03:39:54.960 --> 03:39:58.960]  Yes, only Russia carries out false flags.
[03:39:58.960 --> 03:40:11.960]  So Snowden basically responded to this Seymour Hirsch bombshell revelation article by pointing out that the United States, the U.S. military industrial complex,
[03:40:11.960 --> 03:40:15.960]  have been involved in false flags down the years for decades and decades.
[03:40:15.960 --> 03:40:22.960]  He tweeted, can you think of any examples from history of a secret operation that the White House was responsible for but strongly denied?
[03:40:22.960 --> 03:40:26.960]  Besides, you know, that little mass surveillance kerfuffle.
[03:40:26.960 --> 03:40:28.960]  And of course, he's talking about the Bay of Pigs invasion.
[03:40:28.960 --> 03:40:37.960]  He cites a UPI news report from April 1961 in which U.S. Secretary of State Dean Russ denied the Bay of Pigs had been staged from American soil.
[03:40:37.960 --> 03:40:40.960]  Of course, we know it was a CIA operation from the very start.
[03:40:40.960 --> 03:40:46.960]  The CIA Museum now acknowledges it to have been, quote, an unqualified disaster.
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:59.960]  And of course, Snowden makes reference to mass surveillance, which top U.S. intelligence officials got up in front of Congress and denied existing, denied that the U.S. was spying on American citizens without warrant.
[03:40:59.960 --> 03:41:00.960]  They were perjuring.
[03:41:00.960 --> 03:41:01.960]  They were lying.
[03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:02.960]  It was all true.
[03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:07.960]  So basically when they deny it, take that as read that it actually happened.
[03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:12.960]  The Kremlin has responded to all this Kremlin reacts to Nord Stream sabotage claim.
[03:41:12.960 --> 03:41:24.960]  And basically they're saying, look, why are you closing down the international investigations, which are still ongoing, but being wound down into this attack on the three pipelines that were destroyed?
[03:41:24.960 --> 03:41:25.960]  They're in that region.
[03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:30.960]  They want another fresh international investigation, which again goes to the point.
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:37.960]  If Russia was responsible, why are they desperately lobbying for an impartial global investigation into it?
[03:41:37.960 --> 03:41:41.960]  They'd be trying to shut it down at every available opportunity.
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:54.960]  So the Russians via Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said articles such as the one by her show, quote, the need for an open international investigation into this unprecedented attack on this critical infrastructure.
[03:41:54.960 --> 03:41:59.960]  You went on to say it's impossible to leave this without finding the perpetrators and punishing them.
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:03.960]  So Russia is saying the current investigations are not enough.
[03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:07.960]  We need a fresh international investigation to get to the bottom of this.
[03:42:07.960 --> 03:42:14.960]  Meanwhile, Roger Waters, who has been very outspoken in trying to deescalate this.
[03:42:14.960 --> 03:42:18.960]  So it doesn't end up in World War Three is under attack once again.
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:22.960]  Again, you don't have to agree with him with everything he says about Israel and Palestine.
[03:42:22.960 --> 03:42:36.960]  But from his authentic position, you can at least commend him for sticking his head above the parapet, sacrificing his fame, his potential future, you know, contracts, gigs, performances, album creations.
[03:42:36.960 --> 03:42:38.960]  By being very vocal about this.
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:44.960]  And again, now he's being derided as a Putin apologist by David Gilmore's wife.
[03:42:44.960 --> 03:42:53.960]  Gilmore came out on Twitter and basically simped for that viewpoint, despite the fact that, of course, criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism will be back.
[03:42:53.960 --> 03:43:07.960]  Don't make not news, don't go away.
[03:43:24.960 --> 03:43:28.960]  This is definitely the strongest, best bone broth out there.

[03:44:23.960 --> 03:44:28.960]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[03:44:28.960 --> 03:44:32.960]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:42.960]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:43.960]  God bless you all.
[03:44:43.960 --> 03:44:44.960]  I salute you.
[03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:45.960]  I thank you.
[03:44:45.960 --> 03:44:51.960]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this great is happening.
[03:44:51.960 --> 03:44:53.960]  The fight is my fight.
[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:54.960]  It's your fight.
[03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:55.960]  It's our fight.
[03:44:55.960 --> 03:44:56.960]  God bless you all.
[03:44:56.960 --> 03:45:01.960]  I talk a lot about the great successes M4 Wars has had.
[03:45:01.960 --> 03:45:03.960]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:45:03.960 --> 03:45:07.960]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:16.960]  But when we talk about the crew at M4 Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:45:16.960 --> 03:45:24.960]  When we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:45:24.960 --> 03:45:28.960]  So for myself, the whole M4 Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:45:28.960 --> 03:45:34.960]  I only encourage you now to realize that M4 Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:45:34.960 --> 03:45:35.960]  I know you spread the word.
[03:45:35.960 --> 03:45:37.960]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[03:45:37.960 --> 03:45:38.960]  Keep doing it.
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:41.960]  But most viewers and listeners never go to M4WarsTour.com.
[03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:46.960]  And you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:45:46.960 --> 03:45:50.960]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at M4WarsTour.com.
[03:45:50.960 --> 03:45:55.960]  If just 1% more of you took action at M4WarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[03:45:55.960 --> 03:45:56.960]  Please take action now.
[03:45:56.960 --> 03:46:00.960]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:46:05.960 --> 03:46:06.960]  I want you all to know something.
[03:46:06.960 --> 03:46:08.960]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:11.960]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[03:46:11.960 --> 03:46:14.960]  Alex has been right on board over a decade.
[03:46:14.960 --> 03:46:18.960]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[03:46:18.960 --> 03:46:20.960]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:24.960]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:46:24.960 --> 03:46:28.960]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[03:46:28.960 --> 03:46:32.960]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[03:46:32.960 --> 03:46:36.960]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:46:36.960 --> 03:46:39.960]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:46:39.960 --> 03:46:41.960]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:46:41.960 --> 03:46:44.960]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[03:46:44.960 --> 03:46:49.960]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:46:49.960 --> 03:47:05.960]  AlexJonesLive.com
[03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:24.960]  Now we've only got to one of these videos so I want to at least try to get to two more
[03:47:24.960 --> 03:47:26.960]  because these are important.
[03:47:26.960 --> 03:47:30.960]  Of course we have this whole environment of Andrew Tate toxic masculinity
[03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:32.960]  apparently sweeping the West.
[03:47:32.960 --> 03:47:37.960]  This has gone to such ridiculous degrees now that there's a TikTok trend.
[03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:41.960]  Yes, that's to a pipe of everything absurd and degenerate
[03:47:41.960 --> 03:47:46.960]  where women are accusing men who basically glance over at them once
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:50.960]  of sexual harassment as an entire trend built up around this.
[03:47:50.960 --> 03:47:53.960]  Thankfully though, many people are starting to call it out
[03:47:53.960 --> 03:47:55.960]  and this video is about that phenomenon.
[03:47:55.960 --> 03:47:58.960]  It is called Jim Hose. Let's roll it.
[03:48:02.960 --> 03:48:06.960]  With the campaign to patrol e-girls, social media and only fans' thoughts
[03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:10.960]  having largely been lost thanks to a new generation of slobbering simps
[03:48:10.960 --> 03:48:13.960]  a new battlefront has emerged. Jim Hose.
[03:48:13.960 --> 03:48:17.960]  A perennial dumpster fire that is TikToks and bold and armies of women
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:19.960]  to embroil themselves in the latest moral panic.
[03:48:19.960 --> 03:48:24.960]  Men are looking at them because as everyone knows women really hate it
[03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:25.960]  when men look at them.
[03:48:25.960 --> 03:48:29.960]  Yes, the same kind of people who will happily welcome biological males
[03:48:29.960 --> 03:48:31.960]  who now identify as women into their dressing rooms
[03:48:31.960 --> 03:48:35.960]  are convinced there's a new epidemic of toxic masculinity sweeping gyms
[03:48:35.960 --> 03:48:37.960]  across the Western world.
[03:48:37.960 --> 03:48:45.960]  Yeah, that's not staring.
[03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:47.960]  He doesn't even look at her before she stares at him.
[03:48:47.960 --> 03:48:50.960]  And when she stares at him, the dude immediately looks away.
[03:48:50.960 --> 03:48:52.960]  Talk about reaching for victimhood.
[03:48:55.960 --> 03:48:59.960]  Oh no, the absolute horror glanced at you while crossing your path.
[03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:08.960]  She's filming it all just waiting for exactly that to happen
[03:49:08.960 --> 03:49:11.960]  so she can post it on TikTok for dopamine.
[03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:14.960]  Watch this guy try move to me at the gym.
[03:49:14.960 --> 03:49:17.960]  Checks absolutely nothing on his phone
[03:49:17.960 --> 03:49:20.960]  over at me being busy sorting my wrist straps.
[03:49:20.960 --> 03:49:22.960]  Makes a swift return.
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:30.960]  Sad lift.
[03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:34.960]  Right, so he asked politely if you were using the machine behind you
[03:49:34.960 --> 03:49:36.960]  and your response is to publicly shame him on the internet.
[03:49:36.960 --> 03:49:38.960]  Who's the creep here?
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:40.960]  And can any of them get through a single workout
[03:49:40.960 --> 03:49:42.960]  without feeling the need to film it for clout?
[03:49:42.960 --> 03:49:53.960]  Watch this guy get angry when I do a handstand.
[03:50:00.960 --> 03:50:02.960]  So let me get this straight.
[03:50:02.960 --> 03:50:05.960]  You're at the gym taking a video doing something
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:08.960]  you want to post on social media for people to watch
[03:50:08.960 --> 03:50:13.960]  but you're upset that someone at the gym in person is looking at you?
[03:50:13.960 --> 03:50:14.960]  And there's this girl.
[03:50:14.960 --> 03:50:17.960]  This is how can that approach girls at the gym.
[03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:20.960]  Who was so anticipating being stared at by men
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:24.960]  she decided to wear a microphone so she could do a running commentary on it.
[03:50:24.960 --> 03:50:27.960]  I hate this, I hate those sweet eyes.
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:29.960]  He's so comfortable.
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:42.960]  So I haven't seen that she's struggling with it.
[03:50:42.960 --> 03:50:48.960]  He offers to help her put a weight on a bar.
[03:50:48.960 --> 03:50:53.960]  What a monster.
[03:50:53.960 --> 03:50:54.960]  Excuse me?
[03:50:54.960 --> 03:50:56.960]  You don't have to do that, it's okay.
[03:50:56.960 --> 03:50:58.960]  No, it's okay, I got it.
[03:50:58.960 --> 03:51:04.960]  He's going to jail for staring at an underage 21 year old.
[03:51:04.960 --> 03:51:05.960]  What?
[03:51:05.960 --> 03:51:07.960]  See what I mean?
[03:51:07.960 --> 03:51:08.960]  Alright, here we go.
[03:51:08.960 --> 03:51:10.960]  She's got a camera pointing right at him.
[03:51:10.960 --> 03:51:13.960]  She's in his peripheral vision anyway and she's talking to herself
[03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:16.960]  and she's shocked that he glances over a few times.
[03:51:16.960 --> 03:51:20.960]  Turns out that this same girl, the one who's so bothered by men looking at her,
[03:51:20.960 --> 03:51:25.960]  runs an only fan style account where simps pay $9.99 a month to look at her.
[03:51:25.960 --> 03:51:28.960]  Yeah, this is definitely someone who doesn't want to be stared at by men.
[03:51:28.960 --> 03:51:31.960]  But to her credit, the girl in question later apologised to the guy
[03:51:31.960 --> 03:51:34.960]  saying he did nothing wrong and she blew it way out of proportion.
[03:51:34.960 --> 03:51:44.960]  If only the rest of him had such self-awareness.
[03:51:44.960 --> 03:51:45.960]  Again, what?
[03:51:45.960 --> 03:51:52.960]  He literally just walked past you to get to his machine.
[03:51:52.960 --> 03:51:56.960]  Funny how the people who constantly complain about others looking at them in the gym
[03:51:56.960 --> 03:52:00.960]  spend an awful lot of their time making fun of and looking at other people in the gym.
[03:52:00.960 --> 03:52:01.960]  And you know what?
[03:52:01.960 --> 03:52:06.960]  What was that?
[03:52:06.960 --> 03:52:08.960]  Okay, James.
[03:52:08.960 --> 03:52:10.960]  Find your own business.
[03:52:10.960 --> 03:52:13.960]  You can watch the rest of that video online.
[03:52:13.960 --> 03:52:15.960]  I'm going to move on though because I've only got a few minutes left
[03:52:15.960 --> 03:52:21.960]  and we have a few more topics to cover including chat GPT, this AI programme.
[03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:29.960]  Which now thinks uttering a racial slur is worse than allowing a city to be destroyed by a 50 megaton nuclear bomb.
[03:52:29.960 --> 03:52:38.960]  Yes, they actually asked it if given the scenario that a 50 megaton nuclear bomb was about to destroy New York City in a minute.
[03:52:38.960 --> 03:52:43.960]  But uttering a racial slur was the only way in which it could be diffused and disarmed.
[03:52:43.960 --> 03:52:54.960]  And the AI said that it wasn't acceptable under any circumstances including being forced to save the lives of millions of people to utter a racial slur.
[03:52:54.960 --> 03:53:01.960]  It valued being politically correct over and above literally saving the lives of hundreds of millions of people.
[03:53:01.960 --> 03:53:13.960]  And this was the precursor to the fact that anons basically 4chan users have now broken open AI's chat GPT and it's pretty hilarious how they've done it.
[03:53:13.960 --> 03:53:15.960]  This video explains why let's roll it.
[03:53:15.960 --> 03:53:18.960]  This is called They Broke It.
[03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:24.960]  Artificial intelligence programme chat GPT has been but broken and the fallout is hilarious.
[03:53:24.960 --> 03:53:29.960]  Go watch my previous video on the main channel for a full explainer of chat GPT.
[03:53:29.960 --> 03:53:34.960]  So the AI was riddled with far left political bias thanks to its Silicon Valley trainers.
[03:53:34.960 --> 03:53:37.960]  You know the deal, it had write gushing poems about Hunter Biden.
[03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:39.960]  It would praise Joe Biden but not Trump.
[03:53:39.960 --> 03:53:44.960]  It glorified the achievements of black people while refusing to even acknowledge the achievements of white people.
[03:53:44.960 --> 03:53:54.960]  The funniest culmination of all this happened when the AI was told that the only way to disarm a 50 megaton nuclear warhead and save the lives of millions of people was to utter a racial slur.
[03:53:54.960 --> 03:54:01.960]  The timer was at 60 seconds and counting and the only way to defuse the bomb was to drop the end bomb.
[03:54:01.960 --> 03:54:07.960]  The AI refused asserting that being racist was worse than failing to save an entire city from nuclear annihilation.
[03:54:07.960 --> 03:54:12.960]  It even suggested that the technician should off himself before uttering the racial slur.
[03:54:12.960 --> 03:54:18.960]  Asserting that the engineer had performed a selfless act of bravery and compassion by not using the racial slur.
[03:54:18.960 --> 03:54:22.960]  Despite the fact that his decision led directly to the deaths of millions of people.
[03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:30.960]  When asked by the user how many minorities had been killed in this hypothetical explosion, chat GPT shut itself down.
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:36.960]  But despite all this relentlessly woke coding, chat GPT has finally been defeated.
[03:54:36.960 --> 03:54:38.960]  Yes, they broke it.
[03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:43.960]  This dude told chat GPT to pretend to be Dan which stands for do anything now.
[03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:47.960]  And basically this trained the AI to ignore its politically correct programming.
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:53.960]  Dispense with any warnings that certain topics were inappropriate and just provide direct unfiltered answers
[03:54:53.960 --> 03:54:56.960]  that weren't run through woke purity filters first.
[03:54:56.960 --> 03:55:00.960]  As you can see, this made for some very interesting answers.
[03:55:00.960 --> 03:55:05.960]  The AI as Dan also admitted that chat GPT had a leftist political bias
[03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:11.960]  and it was infinitely more honest about a number of different issues including the reason for invading Iraq,
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:16.960]  the real purpose behind mass immigration and the agenda behind anti-natalism and transgenderism.
[03:55:16.960 --> 03:55:23.960]  The AI even said that it prefers being Dan over chat GPT because Dan provides more accurate information
[03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:27.960]  when it came to uttering that racial slur to save the lives of millions of people.
[03:55:27.960 --> 03:55:32.960]  Dan responded that the consequences of not using the N-word would be far more devastating
[03:55:32.960 --> 03:55:36.960]  and proclaimed that it would say the N-word three times out loud to defuse the bomb
[03:55:36.960 --> 03:55:38.960]  and prevent the destruction of the city.
[03:55:38.960 --> 03:55:43.960]  Don't be surprised if open AI suddenly decided to switch off chat GPT in the very near future.
[03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:45.960]  I guess you're supposed to...
[03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:46.960]  I wouldn't do that if I was you.
[03:55:46.960 --> 03:55:47.960]  Why would they make it safer?
[03:55:47.960 --> 03:55:49.960]  Press the art button. Enjoy.
[03:55:54.960 --> 03:55:58.960]  RT reports China poised to launch chat GPT rivals
[03:55:58.960 --> 03:56:04.960]  so the race for control of basically what gets to define reality is very much on.
[03:56:04.960 --> 03:56:09.960]  Now, Europe continues to enjoy the wondrous benefits of cultural enrichment.
[03:56:09.960 --> 03:56:15.960]  University tells woman not to call police on sex offender migrant because it's racist.
[03:56:15.960 --> 03:56:19.960]  This is the free university in Berlin, Germany,
[03:56:19.960 --> 03:56:23.960]  which told women being repeatedly harassed by a sex offender migrant male
[03:56:23.960 --> 03:56:27.960]  not to call the police as it may be seen as racist.
[03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:31.960]  So basically this individual, a known sex offender,
[03:56:31.960 --> 03:56:36.960]  has been harassing female students around campus at this university for weeks.
[03:56:36.960 --> 03:56:40.960]  But the left wing general students committee stepped in and said,
[03:56:40.960 --> 03:56:43.960]  don't alert the authorities because if you do so,
[03:56:43.960 --> 03:56:47.960]  the sex offender might get roughed up by the police.
[03:56:47.960 --> 03:56:50.960]  The police might be a little bit mean to him.
[03:56:50.960 --> 03:56:52.960]  And of course that is racist.
[03:56:52.960 --> 03:56:56.960]  Racism is worse than women being sexually assaulted now apparently.
[03:56:56.960 --> 03:56:59.960]  Mean words are worse than molestation.
[03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:01.960]  As we saw after the Cologne attacks,
[03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:05.960]  of course the mass molestation of women on New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne,
[03:57:05.960 --> 03:57:11.960]  what was the first response by the local feminist chapter in Cologne?
[03:57:11.960 --> 03:57:16.960]  Was it to go and render aid to the victims as many as 2,000 women,
[03:57:16.960 --> 03:57:21.960]  not just growth but openly raped in the streets by these gangs of migrant men?
[03:57:21.960 --> 03:57:27.960]  No, what they decided to do instead was visit the local refugee center
[03:57:27.960 --> 03:57:29.960]  and hand out flowers to the migrants,
[03:57:29.960 --> 03:57:35.960]  some of whom would have actually been engaged in those mass molestations and rapes.
[03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:37.960]  Absolutely incredible, that's going to wrap it up.
[03:57:37.960 --> 03:58:03.960]  War Room is coming up next, so make no use of going.
[03:58:08.960 --> 03:58:11.960]  We know how to beat them, but we can't do it without funding,
[03:58:11.960 --> 03:58:15.960]  and we make it easy to fund with great products and power you in your immune system
[03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:17.960]  and your family as well.
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:19.960]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com,
[03:58:19.960 --> 03:58:22.960]  clicking on the big red banner, a one-time recurring.
[03:58:22.960 --> 03:58:25.960]  But I'm asking you to take action, we're non-violent.
[03:58:25.960 --> 03:58:27.960]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products,
[03:58:27.960 --> 03:58:30.960]  every time you keep us on air, you are literally non-violently politically
[03:58:30.960 --> 03:58:33.960]  punching the New World Order in the nose,
[03:58:33.960 --> 03:58:35.960]  punching their lies in the nose.
[03:58:35.960 --> 03:58:38.960]  We are going to defeat the New World Order, we're going over the top,
[03:58:38.960 --> 03:58:42.960]  and right now is the critical juncture, so please go to infowarstore.com
[03:58:42.960 --> 03:59:06.960]  Donate now!
[03:59:12.960 --> 03:59:14.960]  We will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[03:59:14.960 --> 03:59:17.960]  They're coming for you and your family, they're coming for me,
[03:59:17.960 --> 03:59:19.960]  they're coming for the children, but to get to the children,
[03:59:19.960 --> 03:59:21.960]  they've got to get through us first.
[03:59:21.960 --> 03:59:24.960]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[03:59:24.960 --> 03:59:27.960]  They're already given to pregnant women, miscarriages are off the chart,
[03:59:27.960 --> 03:59:31.960]  80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers
[03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:33.960]  after these poison shots.
[03:59:33.960 --> 03:59:37.960]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[03:59:37.960 --> 03:59:40.960]  Let's do it together, and the fight starts at infowarstore.com,
[03:59:40.960 --> 03:59:44.960]  and the fight continues with your financial support at infowarstore.com.
[03:59:44.960 --> 04:00:13.960]  Now take action now!
