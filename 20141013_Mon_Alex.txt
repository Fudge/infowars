[00:00.000 --> 00:15.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:15.880 --> 00:35.880]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones it's the Alex Jones
[00:35.880 --> 00:41.920]  show live I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones today again huge show lined up
[00:41.920 --> 00:47.920]  we've got Wayne Madsen coming up in the next hour to talk about the NSA, ISIS and the Ukraine
[00:47.920 --> 00:53.920]  Russia situation David Knight in studio is going to pop in on a couple of occasions with the latest
[00:53.920 --> 01:00.520]  breaking news we've also got Anthony Gucciotti on his experience this weekend he went to an Alice
[01:00.520 --> 01:07.040]  Cooper concert in Houston and basically was faced with TSA style grope down procedures we're going
[01:07.040 --> 01:14.240]  to get into that and a lot more as well as your calls top story on Drudge report right now WHO
[01:14.240 --> 01:20.640]  says Ebola is most severe acute health emergency in modern times this has just been posted up on
[01:20.640 --> 01:26.240]  the Drudge report the Ebola outbreak is the most severe acute modern health emergency the World
[01:26.240 --> 01:31.080]  Health Organization has warned the agencies director general Margaret Chan said the epidemic has
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.960]  proved the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe sustained and threatening public health
[01:35.960 --> 01:42.440]  emergency she added that new cases of Ebola are now rising exponentially in the three hardest hit
[01:42.440 --> 01:49.840]  countries Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone so the WHO again which has treated this outbreak with the
[01:49.840 --> 01:57.320]  seriousness it deserves in contrast to the CDC is sounding the alarm bells but that doesn't seem
[01:57.320 --> 02:04.480]  to be much of a concern for NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman now this is the
[02:04.480 --> 02:11.400]  woman if you remember back in 2009 during the swine flu outbreak she went on MSNBC and said
[02:11.400 --> 02:19.240]  quote get your damn vaccine now she's been caught violating a quarantine order she was in contact
[02:19.240 --> 02:26.520]  work directly with cameraman Ashoka Mukpo who has Ebola he's an Ebola victim she worked directly
[02:26.520 --> 02:34.200]  with him now she's violating a quarantine order in New York to go and fetch her favorite soup so
[02:34.200 --> 02:38.880]  we're going to get into that we're going to play the clip from back in 2009 where she pimped
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.640]  vehemently for the pharmaceutical industry and said get your damn vaccine stop questioning the
[02:44.640 --> 02:49.520]  government there you see the article out of the Daily Mail now she's violating the quarantine
[02:49.520 --> 02:57.240]  having been in contact with an Ebola victim to go and fetch her favorite soup stunning hypocrisy
[02:57.240 --> 03:03.800]  we're going to get into that clip in the next segment Reuters is reporting doctors are furious
[03:03.800 --> 03:09.840]  at the CDC for blaming the Texas nurse who got Ebola from a patient of course yesterday emerged
[03:09.840 --> 03:14.720]  that there was a second case of Ebola in Dallas we covered that on the show yesterday but now again
[03:14.720 --> 03:22.560]  the CDC it seems is passing the buck blaming the Texas nurse who contracted the virus from Duncan
[03:22.560 --> 03:28.120]  patient zero there in Dallas of course we know that she was wearing the full protective gear
[03:28.120 --> 03:34.080]  that she should not have contracted the virus if proper precautions were taken the CDC is
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.600]  basically blaming the hospital blaming the nursing question and again no questions are
[03:39.600 --> 03:44.440]  being asked about if this hospital received the proper training to deal with Ebola we know
[03:44.440 --> 03:50.360]  that they did receive some level of training before patient zero arrived whether that was
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.000]  enough to cope with that situation obviously not in this case and again more questions about
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.080]  has the virus mutated is it being communicated more easily than we're being told the more
[04:03.080 --> 04:09.480]  questions we ask of the CDC the more the CDC seems to pass the buck and blame other people of
[04:09.480 --> 04:15.720]  course we had the story on Friday where doctors were desperately calling the CDC to report
[04:15.720 --> 04:21.640]  potentially Ebola cases 50% of the time they were getting the run around or being ignored
[04:21.640 --> 04:29.920]  completely so again as the CDC fails forward in its mission to control this Ebola outbreak it's
[04:29.920 --> 04:35.000]  now blaming other people blaming the hospital blaming the nurse we're going to get into more
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.360]  news about Ebola the economy as well David Knight in studio is going to throw some fresh
[04:40.360 --> 04:46.520]  perspective on other news issues we've got NSA whistleblower Wayne Madsen coming up in the second
[04:46.520 --> 04:51.840]  hour and Anthony Guciardi to talk about his experience in Houston this past weekend getting

[08:36.520 --> 08:41.680]  virus may soon go airborne of course we've had many concerns voiced about this over
[08:41.680 --> 08:47.640]  the past several weeks not least of which was the 2012 canadian study before that which
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.400]  found that the Ebola virus could be transmitted from pigs to monkeys who were not in direct
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.160]  contact with each other so now we have another expert this is the top story up on info wars
[08:58.160 --> 09:04.720]  dot com saying the Ebola virus may soon go airborne dr. david sanders of Purdue University
[09:04.720 --> 09:13.160]  told RTV 6 on Sunday Ebola is primed to have respiratory transmission so more concerns
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.560]  about that they see the article will play the video a little later in the show the WHO
[09:19.560 --> 09:24.440]  is saying that Ebola is the most severe acute health emergency in modern times something
[09:24.440 --> 09:31.040]  which doesn't seem to be much of a concern for NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy
[09:31.040 --> 09:38.120]  Snyderman who was in contact with an Ebola victim Ashoka Mukpo he visited Africa a cameraman
[09:38.120 --> 09:44.560]  working for NBC came back had contact with Nancy Snyderman she was put under a mandatory
[09:44.560 --> 09:52.120]  quarantine order for 21 days and she almost immediately violated that order to carry out
[09:52.120 --> 09:57.840]  the important task of going to fetch her favorite soup and why is that of interest well because
[09:57.840 --> 10:06.320]  back in 2009 Snyderman appeared on MSNBC during the swine flu hysteria of course that was
[10:06.320 --> 10:13.200]  a completely fabricated fear mongering event they had the vaccine lined up before the outbreak
[10:13.200 --> 10:18.840]  the threat of swine flu was minimal to the vast majority of the population not only
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.640]  in the United States but worldwide but they pushed the hysteria they fanned the flames
[10:23.640 --> 10:31.760]  of panic in order to sell that vaccine of course Wolfgang Wodog of the EU health council came
[10:31.760 --> 10:37.640]  out almost immediately after the outbreak was revealed to say that it was a complete scam
[10:37.640 --> 10:43.320]  the false pandemic drug firms cashed in on scare of a swine flu says Euro health chief
[10:43.320 --> 10:48.960]  and he actually committed the parliamentary investigation into that and found that it was
[10:48.960 --> 10:54.400]  a complete hoax yet all around the world these vaccines were sold were bought by governments
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.560]  wasting huge amounts of money and many people actually got sick from the side effects of
[10:59.560 --> 11:06.960]  the vaccine and it was a complete scam a complete hoax to make money for big pharma and Snyderman
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.640]  is no greater cheerleader for big pharma as she proved in a 2009 MSNBC appearance which
[11:14.640 --> 11:19.760]  we're going to go to now roll and look this is one time forget the conspiracy listen to
[11:19.760 --> 11:24.080]  our government agencies these guys are telling the truth you know there's no conspiracy here
[11:24.080 --> 11:30.400]  folks just get your damn vaccine thank you doctor thank you thank you no no I like what
[11:30.400 --> 11:39.000]  my doctor says get your damn vaccine so she's so concerned about public health she's urging
[11:39.000 --> 11:45.960]  people to get the vaccine back in 2009 during the swine flu hoax fear mongering hysteria
[11:45.960 --> 11:52.760]  pandemic which was ginned up by the pharmaceutical industry in alliance with major governments
[11:52.760 --> 11:59.120]  but now the mail online reports NBC chief medical correspondent accused of violating ebola
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.800]  quarantine to visit her favorite soup restaurant and again she had contact with an ebola victim
[12:06.800 --> 12:13.200]  a cameraman working for MSNBC the NBC news crew exposed to a bowl were forced into mandatory
[12:13.200 --> 12:18.760]  quarantine after chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman violated their voluntary isolation
[12:18.760 --> 12:24.240]  to visit her favorite soup restaurant reports reveal the 62 year old was one of the seven
[12:24.240 --> 12:29.880]  people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days as doctors treat the stations
[12:29.880 --> 12:36.680]  cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease so she's happy to pimp for big pharma and
[12:36.680 --> 12:42.560]  remember that big pharma spends more money on advertising than it does on actual research
[12:42.560 --> 12:48.560]  and development it's a profit driven industry to sell vaccines to sell drugs whether they
[12:48.560 --> 12:54.000]  actually have an effect or not and we know in the case of the 2009 swine flu outbreak
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.880]  that it was a completely contrived hoax to sell vaccines the swine flu virus itself was
[12:59.880 --> 13:05.320]  not a threat to the vast majority of people it was only a threat to the elderly the ill
[13:05.320 --> 13:10.160]  or the young so huge numbers of the population had no need to take this vaccine they did
[13:10.160 --> 13:16.440]  anyway simply because of the corporate media brainwashing campaign behind which lay people
[13:16.440 --> 13:22.680]  like Snyderman get your damn vaccines and now she's waltzing around New York to pick
[13:22.680 --> 13:28.240]  up her favorite soup after she's been ordered to be under quarantine for 21 days because
[13:28.240 --> 13:33.880]  she could have been exposed to ebola again the heights of hypocrisy no no bounds and
[13:33.880 --> 13:38.800]  it just proves that this individual and many like her who go on the mainstream media to
[13:38.800 --> 13:44.600]  promote vaccines to promote drugs are simply pimping for the pharmaceutical industry and
[13:44.600 --> 13:50.360]  have no actual concern about public health whatsoever we're going to go to Joe Biggs
[13:50.360 --> 13:56.000]  now who is on the border again staying with the ebola situation he's there in mcallon
[13:56.000 --> 14:02.400]  texas so Joe from the people you've talked to do you think there's genuine concern about
[14:02.400 --> 14:08.600]  the ebola outbreak and the potential of individuals coming across the border infected with ebola
[14:08.600 --> 14:13.240]  Joe BiggsinfoWars.com I'm actually standing right outside of the Rio Grande Regional Hospital
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.760]  one of the frontline spots right here at the border in case illegal zoo come across with
[14:18.760 --> 14:24.400]  ebola and yes there are people that have concerns about this you know because when the government
[14:24.400 --> 14:29.200]  comes out and says there's nothing to worry about what's aware those people know that's
[14:29.200 --> 14:34.400]  when you need to worry that's the scary time to start really hunkering and thinking about
[14:34.400 --> 14:39.880]  what you need to do to protect yourself and your family you know Alex shot a video yesterday
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.840]  the general of south com coming out saying that he spent some time in Costa Rica at an
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.680]  embassy he spoke with an individual they're saying that they had Liberians that were coming
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.120]  in the Trinidad and then moving their way up into America wanting to go into New York
[14:54.120 --> 15:00.640]  so that's a big threat right there they're worried that if ebola does begin to spread
[15:00.640 --> 15:05.160]  through South America places like Costa Rica things like that they don't have any kind
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.400]  of capabilities to stop or fight that whatsoever they don't have the medical training or the
[15:09.400 --> 15:14.880]  facilities or equipment whatsoever so if that were to happen there in South America what's
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.360]  going to happen if you get it if you think you've been in contact you're going to move
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.280]  up north in towards America to see if you can get help at some time and the amount of people
[15:23.280 --> 15:27.800]  they're going to insect and you know touch and come in contact with on the way up here
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.040]  is of will be hard to track so that's a big threat the threat of illegals coming through
[15:33.040 --> 15:37.640]  South America into Mexico and then smuggling themselves all the ending here and taking
[15:37.640 --> 15:41.520]  time on things like that to keep their fever down so they can get through and then once
[15:41.520 --> 15:44.560]  they hear they show signs and symptoms someone's going to pick them up and bring them to a
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.280]  facility just like that here so I want to go in here today and see if I can find out
[15:49.280 --> 15:56.280]  whether or not this place is equipped to handle in a bowl of patient and what steps they're
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.720]  looking at right now to help combat that and whether or not the CDC is involved with letting
[16:01.720 --> 16:07.680]  them know what to or not do that's interesting because we've had nurses protesting over the
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.960]  past few weeks about how they have received basically no training whatsoever to deal with
[16:12.960 --> 16:19.360]  Ebola so there are four from what I read four facilities within the United States to the
[16:19.360 --> 16:25.320]  bio level security level where they could actually deal with successfully these Ebola
[16:25.320 --> 16:31.480]  patients that they could handle up to 10 Ebola patients I believe the story read so you're
[16:31.480 --> 16:34.920]  going to go in there and ask questions what are you going to ask them well I'm going to
[16:34.920 --> 16:41.240]  ask them what their what their protocol is so far or if they have a protocol let's start
[16:41.240 --> 16:46.200]  off with that if they have a protocol that they have the equipment are they able to contain
[16:46.200 --> 16:52.800]  someone that they have the the means and the the the money to actually go out and do that
[16:52.800 --> 16:58.120]  contract tracing are the first line responders the EMTs that are bringing patients in via
[16:58.120 --> 17:03.560]  ambulance up to speed on what's going on or do have they done anything to that nature
[17:03.560 --> 17:08.360]  whatsoever so I'd be surprised to see if this hospital which is one of the main ones in
[17:08.360 --> 17:12.400]  the area where many illegals come through if they're going to be equipped to handle that
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.000]  if it happens and then another thing you were talking about earlier Paul that I thought
[17:16.000 --> 17:19.400]  was kind of interesting about the vaccines the flu last night I was watching the show
[17:19.400 --> 17:26.160]  on a Fox News Justice with Judge Jeanine and she had a doctor on from New York and Judge
[17:26.160 --> 17:30.400]  Jeanine she goes well how are we going to stop the confusion of all these patients with
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.800]  flu like symptoms coming in he said go get your flu shot go get your flu shot because
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.600]  he says if everyone gets their flu shot then if you come in a flu like symptoms we can
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.720]  take it more seriously and know what it'll stop confusion in our emergency rooms and
[17:44.720 --> 17:50.320]  Joe I mean we had a conversation before you're quite prepared to go to West Africa to these
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.880]  places that have been directly impacted with Ebola and report from there isn't that the
[17:54.880 --> 17:58.960]  case yes I'm willing to do whatever I have to do to expose and get to the bottom of the
[17:58.960 --> 18:03.960]  truth and find out whether CDC is not telling us whether or not this is a complete and total
[18:03.960 --> 18:08.880]  host or if this is really a legitimate thing that we should be worried about as Americans
[18:08.880 --> 18:11.120]  I'd like to get the bottom of that.
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.560]  All right Joe Biggs reporting for info wars.com we may get an update from you later in the
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.720]  show if not on the nightly news thanks for joining us thank you Paul okay there goes
[18:21.720 --> 18:28.000]  Joe Biggs at the border there reporting on the Ebola situation RT is reporting suspected
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.160]  Ebola carrier wrapped in plastic after Czech police seal off rail station and this was basically
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.480]  an individual who arrived on a flight from West Africa then he went through a train station
[18:39.480 --> 18:45.760]  in the Czech Republic they basically put a black plastic bag over his head again taking
[18:45.760 --> 18:51.080]  extreme precautions there and took him to a hospital it later turned out that he he
[18:51.080 --> 18:55.400]  only had a cold so again it's it's the question about getting the balance between people who
[18:55.400 --> 19:00.560]  were genuinely showing symptoms of Ebola there you see the video of this individual being
[19:00.560 --> 19:07.080]  wheeled through the train station in the Czech Republic after having arrived with Ebola like
[19:07.080 --> 19:12.880]  symptoms later turned out he basically only had a cold so again there's this balance between
[19:12.880 --> 19:19.360]  hysteria and fearmongering we know that the Ebola tests which are currently being imposed
[19:19.360 --> 19:24.440]  at airports and in some cases not at all as we will see after the break can be fooled
[19:24.440 --> 19:30.880]  by ibuprofen and other medicines and yet people with colds are now being wheeled off as potential
[19:30.880 --> 19:36.680]  Ebola victims so this could escalate really quickly this could get to a panic phase where
[19:36.680 --> 19:42.440]  anybody with flu is treated as a potential Ebola victim so we've got to watch out for
[19:42.440 --> 19:48.120]  that in the coming days and weeks that could escalate very quickly after the break we're

[24:34.960 --> 24:40.320]  in plotting and carrying out the 9 11 attacks we're going to get into that with Wayne Madsen
[24:40.320 --> 24:44.840]  in the next hour going back to the bowling news though of course we had the clip before
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.760]  the break NBC's chief medical correspondent lecturing everybody and how they should trust
[24:49.760 --> 24:56.000]  the government and get their swine flu back vaccine back in 2009 then herself violating
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.280]  the quarantine order to carry out the important task of fetching her favorite soup in New York
[25:03.280 --> 25:09.640]  now we also have doctors returning from Nigeria saying that they receive zero checks whatsoever
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.000]  when they travel through airports we're going to go to that clip now how many days did you
[25:14.000 --> 25:21.160]  spend in 31 days 31 days then you come back to the US through Germany which city in Germany
[25:21.160 --> 25:27.240]  Frankfurt Frankfurt you go Frankfurt Miami nonstop yes and then you land in Miami Miami
[25:27.240 --> 25:33.720]  is international airport and then what happens I I get to Frank I get to the to the kiosk
[25:33.720 --> 25:39.320]  because I'm a global entry person and you know enter the information put my fingerprints
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.720]  and mark the fact that I've been in Nigeria and nobody cares and nobody stopped nobody
[25:44.720 --> 25:53.560]  not a single test nothing and you were thinking one and I'm thinking that I've just spent
[25:53.560 --> 26:02.320]  the bulk of my time worrying about entrance and exits because my my key role was to help
[26:02.320 --> 26:10.760]  develop the exit strategy to and the entrance strategy so no more cases of Ebola could be
[26:10.760 --> 26:16.040]  imported into Nigeria and no case of Ebola could be exported from Nigeria they were doing
[26:16.040 --> 26:20.160]  it in Nigeria but no one was doing it here in the United States nor in Germany all right
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.040]  so were you surprised then when you heard about the first case of Ebola here in the
[26:25.040 --> 26:30.960]  United States no it was about to happen yeah because because of what we've already spoken
[26:30.960 --> 26:38.000]  about that some that the incubation period is two to 21 days and the best we could do
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.640]  and we did the best that any country is doing in Nigeria but the best we can do is is look
[26:44.640 --> 26:52.280]  at for symptoms test for symptoms in symptomatic patients and ask epidemiologic questions but
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.160]  if somebody either doesn't know they were exposed or lies on these questionnaires like the first
[26:58.160 --> 27:06.320]  case who came from oh yeah oh he lied a lot okay not not not to Eileen Marty who returned
[27:06.320 --> 27:11.440]  from Nigeria after spending a month in the country of course another another Ebola hit
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.440]  country she returned back through Miami International Airport received no checks whatsoever the
[27:17.440 --> 27:22.440]  CDC is supposed to have these checks in place we had the story around a week ago where a
[27:22.440 --> 27:30.360]  CNN reporting team had gone to Liberia had contact at a distance at least with Ebola victims
[27:30.360 --> 27:37.160]  they came back again no questions asked whatsoever in case in fact they approach the customs people
[27:37.160 --> 27:43.520]  the officials at the airport told them directly they had come back from Liberia after doing
[27:43.520 --> 27:49.200]  a story on Ebola and again nothing absolutely nothing you know the TSA they're really on
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.600]  top of things when it comes to snow globes or emptying out your ancestors ashes but when
[27:55.600 --> 28:00.320]  it comes to Ebola when it comes to a real threat the officials at the airports there
[28:00.320 --> 28:06.240]  across the country are basically asleep at the wheel even after these CDC measures were
[28:06.240 --> 28:12.440]  supposedly put in place they see the article CNN reporter returning from Liberia horrified
[28:12.440 --> 28:18.320]  by lack of airport Ebola screening that was around a week ago this is still going on this
[28:18.320 --> 28:25.920]  doctor returned and received no screening whatsoever then we have articles like this they're trying
[28:25.920 --> 28:33.200]  to pin concerns about Ebola onto idiotic rap stars like Chris Brown Chris Brown tweets
[28:33.200 --> 28:40.160]  Ebola is population control the singer tweeted on Monday he thinks Ebola is a form of population
[28:40.160 --> 28:45.600]  control I don't know but I think Ebola epidemic is a form of population control it's getting
[28:45.600 --> 28:52.880]  crazy bra so Chris Brown is now the face of skepticism about the government's handling
[28:52.880 --> 28:59.600]  of the Ebola crisis and almost instantly the mainstream media hijacked this tweet and basically
[28:59.600 --> 29:05.080]  turned it into a massive story because the genuine concerns particularly about the virus
[29:05.080 --> 29:10.600]  having potentially mutated and got airborne to a limited extent are being shuffled to
[29:10.600 --> 29:16.160]  one side they're not being addressed by the CDC there we have the article Ebola expert
[29:16.160 --> 29:23.960]  virus may soon may soon go airborne we had a New York Times op-ed recently where another
[29:23.960 --> 29:29.240]  expert was saying the same thing we had the University of Illinois study and of course
[29:29.240 --> 29:35.000]  we had the 2012 Canadian study all saying the same thing so a lot of concerns about whether
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.440]  Ebola is going airborne but the media is more concerned about Chris Brown's tweets and he's
[29:41.440 --> 29:46.480]  now the authority on skepticism about the government's handling of Ebola we'll be back
[29:46.480 --> 29:50.360]  with David Knight with more news after break it's the Alex Jones show live stay tuned we're

[33:43.200 --> 33:50.200]  we have a new york times story leaning forward msnbc losers ground to rival cnn yet another
[33:50.200 --> 33:57.560]  record drop in msnbc's viewing figures and that applies also to cnn fox news across the
[33:57.560 --> 34:02.960]  board rachel madow the biggest star on the msnbc cable network just posted her lowest
[34:02.960 --> 34:10.200]  quarterly ratings results ever morning joe msnbc's signature morning program scored its
[34:10.200 --> 34:14.840]  second lowest quarterly ratings reaching an average of just 87,000 viewers in the key
[34:14.840 --> 34:21.560]  news demographic group now david night i made a video on friday a three minute video about
[34:21.560 --> 34:27.400]  the simpsons supposedly predicting the Ebola outbreak back in 1997 of course you know i
[34:27.400 --> 34:35.280]  debunked it was complete nonsense but that one video got more views than msnbc's signature
[34:35.280 --> 34:40.400]  morning program in their key demographic does each day what does that tell you about the
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.640]  decline of the mainstream media yeah kind of beating about their own game i guess you
[34:44.640 --> 34:50.400]  know there there we have a lot of news that goes up and and just look at the the talk
[34:50.400 --> 34:57.360]  radio audience for us for other talk radio hosts it dwarfs in any given moment there
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.520]  highest ratings so yeah people are not looking for that it's it's kind of like what you see
[35:01.520 --> 35:07.280]  with the currency going on in venezuela you've now got a bitcoin interest in venezuela because
[35:07.280 --> 35:13.160]  they've had currency controls on there we've had information control and people are hungry
[35:13.160 --> 35:17.760]  for authentic information they want to hear real stories that aren't filtered that aren't
[35:17.760 --> 35:25.400]  spun and they're not going to hear it on msnbc they know that so obviously venezuelans turn
[35:25.400 --> 35:31.480]  to bitcoin tell us i mean i we've heard stories about rationing of toilet paper in venezuela
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.320]  how are they using the cryptocurrency to get around those government control measures well
[35:36.320 --> 35:42.600]  yeah you know earlier this year bloomberg did a a piece they were talking to bond investors
[35:42.600 --> 35:48.760]  and they said venezuela is a great place to invest we've made nearly 700 return on investment
[35:48.760 --> 35:55.000]  under hugo chavez we don't expect it to change under his successor that the people the leadership
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.680]  in venezuela understands that their first responsibility is to pay off their debtors
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.240]  okay they're they're sovereign debt at meantime in that article they're pointing out how the
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.880]  venezuelans are having to go to neighboring countries to get water to get medicine to get food
[36:09.880 --> 36:14.440]  they didn't have basic necessities i mean it was beyond even toilet paper so they've also had
[36:14.440 --> 36:19.320]  currency controls and in this article from roiders it says to new york-based venezuelan
[36:19.320 --> 36:24.360]  brothers are hoping this week to start trading on the first bitcoin exchange in venezuela they
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.960]  said they've already got several hundred bitcoin enthusiasts there so you know it's kind of one
[36:29.960 --> 36:36.120]  way one of the advantages of course of bitcoin is to be able to transfer your money from one
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.200]  jurisdiction to another and that's getting increasingly difficult even in western countries
[36:40.200 --> 36:45.480]  with currency controls to get your money out of a given country because they just don't allow you
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.960]  to transfer it in the conventional banking system of course you can't carry it with you you'll get
[36:49.960 --> 36:56.440]  it stolen by the law enforcement at the airport if nowhere else you know because they have the
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.640]  asset forfeiture laws which are not really laws they're not legitimate laws so basically
[37:01.640 --> 37:07.080]  if they merely assert that they think that that currency that you have with you is illegitimate
[37:07.080 --> 37:12.600]  they are entitled according to their policies to keep that money and to keep the proceeds of
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.800]  that money and of course that's a major part of what's driving the war on drugs as well as the
[37:17.800 --> 37:23.800]  militarization of the police are using that to buy some of the things that really in my opinion the
[37:23.800 --> 37:29.480]  police have no business owning and we're going to go to your call shortly as well 1800 259
[37:29.480 --> 37:35.720]  92 31 but david night you had another story about apparently the ivory coast has better
[37:35.720 --> 37:42.040]  security measures in terms of fighting a bowler than the united states it seems yeah it turns out
[37:42.040 --> 37:47.000]  that we're coming up to the chocolate harvesting season in the ivory coast and there's a lot of
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.680]  stories coming out now to expect a price increase on chocolate because the ivory coast has decided
[37:52.680 --> 37:58.520]  that they're going to close their borders because they're concerned about ebola and they're heavily
[37:58.520 --> 38:03.880]  dependent on migrant workers to come in from the countries that are currently being affected by the
[38:03.880 --> 38:08.920]  ebola pandemic they're dependent on those migrant workers to come in and do the harvest but you
[38:08.920 --> 38:16.280]  have a third world country like the ivory coast that has the will as well as the ability to close
[38:16.280 --> 38:20.120]  their borders if they didn't have the ability to do it people wouldn't be concerned about the price
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.840]  going up but we don't have the will to do that we certainly have the ability to do that we certainly
[38:24.840 --> 38:31.560]  have the ability to contain those countries and the measures that we see with the thermometers
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.320]  and that's where that that's just nonsense and everybody knows that that's one of the reasons
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.400]  why people are not paying any attention to the mainstream media because mainstream media is
[38:39.400 --> 38:44.680]  just parroting back what the cdc and the government officials are telling people and quite frankly
[38:44.680 --> 38:50.440]  their first priority is not to protect the public but to keep the borders open it seems just they're
[38:50.440 --> 38:55.160]  trying to save face i mean it seems it's too late now to block the flights because if they did so
[38:55.160 --> 38:59.560]  they would have to acknowledge that that it was a mistake not to do so in the first place and now
[38:59.560 --> 39:05.400]  we have as we saw before the break dr eileen marty saying that she came back from Nigeria
[39:05.400 --> 39:10.920]  having been potentially exposed to ebola and received no checks whatsoever we maybe we could
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.880]  forgive the the cnn reporters a week or two ago because those measures weren't in place but now
[39:15.880 --> 39:21.800]  they are in place people are still returning from ebola hit countries and not receiving any checks
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.920]  not that those checks david night would really have an impact in the first place isn't the only
[39:26.920 --> 39:31.960]  solution to block the flights i don't think they are in place paul i mean we keep hearing from obama
[39:31.960 --> 39:36.600]  and from officials that they put these in place but everybody that's coming through is outraged
[39:36.600 --> 39:40.280]  that absolutely nothing is being done i mean they're still asking people if you're bringing
[39:40.280 --> 39:45.800]  in tobacco or alcohol so they can tax it but they're not interested if you're bringing in ebola
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.560]  they could care less they are not doing it they're simply lying to the people we're seeing this at
[39:51.560 --> 39:57.720]  every level we've seen at the presidential level at the state level here in texas and at the local
[39:57.720 --> 40:02.760]  level with judge jinkins all of them are saying there's absolutely no risk it's not coming to
[40:02.760 --> 40:09.080]  america it's not going to get out of this one patient who has come down with it and now we've
[40:09.080 --> 40:14.840]  seen it spread to a second patient they continue to tell people uh things that aren't true that i
[40:14.840 --> 40:20.840]  believe that they know are not true and here's an interesting story out of breitbart texas governor's
[40:20.840 --> 40:26.120]  office takes over dalis ebola apartment cleanup now we know that this was basically botched in the
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.320]  first place we had the image of the the guys with no protective gear whatsoever pressure
[40:31.320 --> 40:37.880]  washing the ebola vomit off the sidewalk where patient zero uh went to the hospital reports
[40:37.880 --> 40:42.920]  eyewitness reports said that he vomited all over the sidewalk they were there pressure washing it
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.880]  with a hose no protection whatsoever then of course you had the sheriff's deputies who were forced
[40:47.880 --> 40:53.720]  into the apartment one of them got ill thankfully it turned out that he didn't have the ebola virus
[40:53.720 --> 40:58.840]  but now the texas governor's office has taken over the cleanup of that apartment david knight we
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.720]  were told days ago that this cleanup with the hazmat crews as you see there had already taken
[41:03.720 --> 41:09.000]  place and yet apparently now it's been handed off to somebody else they're waiting days to do this
[41:09.000 --> 41:13.800]  and as a matter of fact the company they cleaned up uh mr duncans apartment or the apartment he
[41:13.800 --> 41:19.720]  was staying in uh they took their precautions to a level above what the cdc was telling people so
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.880]  clearly they did not uh believe that they didn't want to take the chance and that's what we should
[41:23.880 --> 41:29.160]  be doing that's what we should be demanding that our officials do that they go an extra level with
[41:29.160 --> 41:34.840]  this an extra set of precaution because clearly they don't understand how easily this is being
[41:34.840 --> 41:39.240]  transmitted we've had now two nurses in western countries that have come down with it that's
[41:39.240 --> 41:44.360]  what we said from the very beginning it was alex jones an info war saying this is violating your
[41:44.360 --> 41:47.720]  protocols and we had medical people that were saying that as well we weren't the only ones who
[41:47.720 --> 41:51.400]  were saying it you're violating your own protocols bringing people into this country to be treated
[41:51.400 --> 41:57.000]  it's too easy for it to get out and now we've seen that happen twice twice in just a few cases
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  there's only been five people is i think that have been brought into the united states and now we've
[42:01.000 --> 42:08.120]  had um one of those cases that has transferred to a medical professional we've seen hundreds of
[42:08.120 --> 42:15.640]  medical professionals in Liberia and Sierra Leone die from this so clearly there's something about
[42:15.640 --> 42:21.320]  the protocols as careful as they are that are not a hundred percent certain and maybe it's modes of
[42:21.320 --> 42:25.400]  transmission that they don't fully understand when i was on the radio yesterday i talked about
[42:25.400 --> 42:29.000]  Nancy right ball who was one of the first two people that was brought back to emory university
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.200]  along with kip brantley she said she had no idea how she had contacted it she said she was not even
[42:34.200 --> 42:38.920]  in the hot zone she was helping to decontaminate the people who uh the doctors who were in the
[42:38.920 --> 42:45.000]  hot zone and she was very careful she knew she did not touch a fellow co-worker who had ebola
[42:45.000 --> 42:50.680]  she said perhaps i touched something that he had touched but see we're getting exactly the opposite
[42:50.680 --> 42:57.320]  message from judge jinkens when he makes a point of saying that he proudly went into the apartment
[42:57.320 --> 43:03.960]  and hung out with these people and then drove them 45 minutes to a new home now i think what he
[43:03.960 --> 43:11.800]  knew or was told is that after several days the chances of a virus not being transmittable of
[43:11.800 --> 43:17.640]  still being alive goes down to nearly zero but it is you can never say with something like this
[43:17.640 --> 43:22.360]  that there is zero risk and that's what they've been telling everybody it is not a 100 chance
[43:22.360 --> 43:25.960]  that you're going to get it or a zero chance a zero percent chance you're going to get it
[43:25.960 --> 43:30.200]  is somewhere in there and why would you roll the dice with yourself with your family
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.680]  with the community and why would you send the message that don't worry about touching stuff
[43:34.680 --> 43:39.480]  that other people have touched if they've got ebola he didn't tell people i think it's safe
[43:39.480 --> 43:44.520]  because so many days have passed because then that would highlight the tardiness of their response
[43:44.520 --> 43:49.880]  yeah i mean it was a pr stunt yeah but again in the case of this this second nurse who was
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.000]  infected she she took full precaution she was wearing the full suit and yet she got infected
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.040]  anyway so again we asked the question has it has it mutated has it gone airborne at least to a
[44:00.040 --> 44:05.400]  limited extent but then there's the flip side of the equation in all this which is the hysteria
[44:05.400 --> 44:11.800]  here we have an article out of cbs news officials air sick passenger on flight from gfk prompts a
[44:11.800 --> 44:17.320]  boluscare at lax a flight from john f kennedy international airport was the center of an
[44:17.320 --> 44:22.520]  investigation in los angeles because of a sick passenger police at los angeles international
[44:22.520 --> 44:28.600]  airport said a passenger who was showing symptoms of the bolivirus was being evaluated later they
[44:28.600 --> 44:35.640]  said the passenger was suffering from air sickness now he saw the video earlier out of rt with the
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.640]  cheque passenger being wheeled through the the train station covered in a black plastic bag
[44:41.640 --> 44:47.480]  turned out that he had a cold so david i mean we've got people with air sickness and colds
[44:47.480 --> 44:52.200]  that are being treated as potential Ebola patients and yet on the flip side we have the
[44:52.200 --> 44:58.280]  complete lack of precaution with the cleaning of the apartment so i mean this this could escalate
[44:58.280 --> 45:04.680]  to a point where anybody who shows any signs of any illness and remember the cdc has imposed those
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.320]  quarantine measures where they can say uh any sign of respiratory illness or indeed
[45:10.200 --> 45:16.200]  no sign whatsoever that was in there that was in obama's executive order could be detained so
[45:16.200 --> 45:20.840]  i mean david this this could get ridiculous where anybody who has a cold who is traveling
[45:20.840 --> 45:26.600]  through an airport gets snatched up uh gets quarantined it's going to vary from location
[45:26.600 --> 45:31.240]  to location they're here in the united states the cdc can make recommendations they can tell people
[45:31.240 --> 45:36.600]  what they think should happen uh but it's ultimately going to be the local authorities who
[45:36.600 --> 45:42.040]  actually take action and so they can overreact or they can underreact they can take the cdc
[45:42.040 --> 45:47.560]  at its word or they can take it to another step uh or they can panic about it and you know quite
[45:47.560 --> 45:53.560]  frankly if you lie to people you're not doing anything to stop the panic because sooner or
[45:53.560 --> 45:58.040]  later and it will be sooner your lie is going to be found out and then you're going to lose
[45:58.040 --> 46:04.040]  people's trust you won't be able to control them and that's the real danger to me when judge jinkens
[46:04.600 --> 46:08.200]  brags about the fact that he hung out with them and then goes to press conferences says i'm still
[46:08.200 --> 46:14.920]  wearing the same shirt that i was with them for over an hour with i mean to me that is reckless
[46:14.920 --> 46:19.640]  behavior and when you do that and then you subsequently have a nurse who is wearing full
[46:19.640 --> 46:24.840]  protective clothing that comes down with it uh people in dallas must be very concerned and
[46:24.840 --> 46:29.880]  evidently judge jinkens has not put himself into quarantine that's the amazing thing he would sign
[46:29.880 --> 46:34.520]  the quarantine order for these people and then he would go hang out with them i mean do you see
[46:34.520 --> 46:39.640]  the contradiction there i mean none of this makes any sense unless you go back and you look at the
[46:39.640 --> 46:45.800]  context that this guy has been all about open borders and back in july he was given a place
[46:45.800 --> 46:51.560]  right across the table from obama when obama came to dallas he was pushing uh bringing immigrant
[46:51.560 --> 46:56.680]  children into a neighborhood going door to door intimidating people about protesting
[46:56.680 --> 47:02.840]  if that were to happen so i think it's purely political but it is reckless behavior and speaking
[47:02.840 --> 47:09.240]  of open borders we've got a story out here cns news reporting south com commander ones of potential
[47:09.240 --> 47:14.280]  ebola driven mass migration from south of border of course we've talked about the potential for
[47:14.280 --> 47:21.080]  ebola tourism people from west africa seeking to enter the united states for treatment now marine
[47:21.080 --> 47:26.200]  corpse general john kelly commander of the u.s southern command predicted last week that the
[47:26.200 --> 47:31.000]  ebola virus will not be contained in west africa and if it infected people the people who flee
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.360]  those countries and spread the disease to central and south america it could cause quote mass migration
[47:36.360 --> 47:41.640]  into the united states of those seeking treatment if it breaks out it's literally
[47:41.640 --> 47:48.600]  katie bar the door he said so david i mean is is that a real threat of people gathering at the border
[47:48.600 --> 47:54.040]  trying to uh become a bolotaurus to get treatment in the united states well absolutely i mean
[47:54.040 --> 47:58.120]  whether they want to be a bolotourist or they want to be a bolotourist i mean that is
[47:58.120 --> 48:05.400]  either one of those things are a real problem and uh i'm also concerned paul about mandatory
[48:05.400 --> 48:10.760]  vaccines some kind of mandatory treatment we see another article today from russia today
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.560]  saying that they've got a vaccine that they're working on with 70 to 90 efficacy that they would
[48:15.560 --> 48:22.040]  send to victims in west africa in two months well in two months if things don't change you're
[48:22.040 --> 48:27.480]  going to have anywhere from five to 15 percent of the population according to cdc's projections
[48:27.480 --> 48:33.400]  infected it's doubling every couple of weeks there that's you're looking at millions of people
[48:33.400 --> 48:36.360]  you're looking at anywhere from a half a million to one and a half million people is what their
[48:36.360 --> 48:43.560]  projections say i'm seeing the same thing from the z-map virus that the gates foundation is
[48:43.560 --> 48:46.520]  getting on board with that saying we're going to ramp up production but it's going to be a few
[48:46.520 --> 48:52.440]  months before we can get there they want this thing to in my opinion build is very interesting
[48:52.440 --> 48:58.520]  to me the timing that we've got all of these solutions essentially nearly ready for the
[48:58.520 --> 49:03.880]  marketplace as this thing breaks out that in of itself is suspicious but i think one of the most
[49:03.880 --> 49:09.640]  suspicious things is that we see the people who are developing z-map virus back well it's not
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.360]  even a vaccine it's a drug of antibodies basically what they're doing is mimicking in an artificial
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.640]  genetically modified way they're mimicking blood transfusions where people get antibodies from
[49:21.640 --> 49:27.000]  survivors that's called convalescent serum there's been experiments that show that that's effective
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.400]  everybody that has survived with the z-map drug has also received a blood transfusion the one
[49:33.400 --> 49:38.760]  patient who received it and died in the west that we know of did not get a blood transfusion
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.320]  that was a spanish priest there are three other people who got it i don't know if they got blood
[49:43.320 --> 49:49.000]  transfusions or not in liberia two of them survived one of them died so they're trying to
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.640]  tell us that z-map is a miracle drug whether or not it works and whether or not blood transfusions
[49:55.640 --> 50:02.120]  work uh are beside the point because what they're doing is mimicking this natural inexpensive
[50:02.680 --> 50:07.560]  technique which is available today there are thousands of people who have survived the ebola
[50:07.560 --> 50:13.640]  uh outbreak in these countries and if they wanted to cheaply set up a donor registry
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.960]  and check the blood that's something they could do now and start to contain this thing rather than
[50:17.960 --> 50:22.680]  letting it build for months and then coming up with a vaccine that they can sell to people in
[50:22.680 --> 50:26.840]  the west because it gets out of control or mandate to people that's what my concern is
[50:27.560 --> 50:32.520]  and i mean it's really crazy here in the united states everywhere i go like every grocery store
[50:32.520 --> 50:38.040]  or western union everywhere get your vaccine get your vaccine they could easily tie that into a
[50:38.040 --> 50:43.640]  bola oh yeah if if this spreads and you know that's definitely a possibility going forward
[50:43.640 --> 50:47.400]  we're going to be back on the alex jones show after the break we're going to be talking to

[54:58.760 --> 55:04.440]  is the disease so we got first price of first place prize of five thousand dollars second place
[55:04.440 --> 55:11.560]  two thousand third place five hundred dollars october 24th is the deadline to submit your entry
[55:11.560 --> 55:17.160]  and alex will announce the winners on the alex john show on halloween october 31st so basically
[55:17.160 --> 55:23.240]  this is a campaign to stress the federal government close the open borders halt the
[55:23.240 --> 55:29.800]  flights from the obola hit countries it's the obola contest the racist obola contest according to
[55:29.800 --> 55:36.040]  some on the left merely using that term is racist of course that's merely trying to impose their
[55:36.040 --> 55:42.760]  thought crime again secure the border join the obola contest and again shoot video of yourself
[55:42.760 --> 55:48.600]  it's important not to just post pictures of yourself placing these flyers in public areas
[55:48.600 --> 55:54.840]  it has to be video so we're sure to get on board with the info wars dot com obola contest
[55:54.840 --> 55:59.400]  david night last few minutes here you had a couple of stories about medical marijuana
[56:00.040 --> 56:05.640]  yeah there's interesting story out of italy that they made medical marijuana legal in italy and
[56:05.640 --> 56:10.040]  then they noticed that it was very expensive it was 10 times the street price so what they've done
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.480]  there is to call in the army so they're using the army to grow medical marijuana i think that's
[56:15.480 --> 56:20.040]  interesting contrast the way we use our military in afghanistan to create a heroin epidemic in the
[56:20.040 --> 56:26.920]  united states and elsewhere we've seen the supply of opium go from about 10 percent under the Taliban
[56:26.920 --> 56:32.760]  to 90 percent of the world supply under the u.s army and we've seen uh herald over there and others
[56:32.760 --> 56:39.800]  point out that they have the u.s military assisting the growing of opium so it's interesting to see
[56:39.800 --> 56:45.320]  that but again what we were talking about before how they would take a natural treatment and they
[56:45.320 --> 56:50.680]  would withhold that or say that there's really it's not clear that there's really any efficacy of
[56:50.680 --> 56:57.720]  that the world health organization has looked at convalescent serum has looked at blood transfusion
[56:57.720 --> 57:03.000]  from people who survived ebola transferring their antibodies and said well you know that's something
[57:03.000 --> 57:08.120]  we need to look at it has a long history as a matter of fact back in the 19th century you had
[57:08.120 --> 57:14.920]  someone win a Nobel prize in science for using that to help with diphtheria this is something
[57:14.920 --> 57:21.000]  they know works it's basically the fundamental principle of vaccines except that uh this doesn't
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.480]  have the additives this is just the antibodies themselves this isn't injecting somebody with a
[57:25.480 --> 57:29.400]  disease live or dead it's simply transferring the antibodies and the people who have been there
[57:29.960 --> 57:36.440]  are very keen to get it you see kent brantley uh gave he got a blood transfusion and survived
[57:36.440 --> 57:41.240]  he gave a blood transfusion now to two people the mbc cameraman who came back has received one from
[57:41.240 --> 57:48.120]  him as well as another doctor in nebraska and uh so they put a lot of store in this and all we see
[57:48.120 --> 57:52.680]  is that the world health organization will say well it's something we should take a look at but
[57:52.680 --> 57:56.680]  we really haven't done any studies well don't hold your breath they said that a couple of
[57:56.680 --> 58:00.680]  months ago and then they complained about how there's a black market you might get blood-borne
[58:00.680 --> 58:06.120]  diseases you can screen for those diseases very easily uh you can set up a registry that would
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.560]  be something that they could do very cheaply but just like the case of medical marijuana where
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.440]  they would prohibit it for people and say you can take a marinal pill which is a part of that a
[58:14.440 --> 58:18.360]  lot of people say it's not very effective a lot of people say that it's not safe you can have that
[58:18.360 --> 58:24.120]  but you can't have the natural stuff that pharmaceutical companies don't control of course
[58:24.120 --> 58:29.400]  in places like california you've got private mercenaries destroying pot plants even though
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.880]  they're completely legal so it's just amazing how the oppression is coming down on this medical
[58:33.880 --> 58:39.960]  marijuana nsa whistleblower wane madson coming up after the break stay tuned in for wars dot com
[58:39.960 --> 58:57.080]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic
[58:57.080 --> 59:01.720]  each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to
[59:01.720 --> 59:06.600]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most americans
[59:06.600 --> 59:12.440]  spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million
[59:12.440 --> 59:17.480]  smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.880]  conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live with pets they're allergic
[59:21.880 --> 59:27.160]  to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[59:27.160 --> 59:32.200]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back
[59:32.200 --> 59:37.800]  against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the usa the new info

[59:47.320 --> 01:00:03.160]  38882533139 waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.280]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:30.120]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.200]  second hour of the alex jones show live final segment here with david night there was a story
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.760]  which went up a couple of days ago fbi chief citizen should be deeply skeptical of government
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:52.520]  american should be deeply skeptical of government power says fbi director james komie adding that
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:58.280]  law enforcement should be able to access someone's telephone only with a court order now this is a guy
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:04.920]  who back during the initial nsa surveillance scandal back in january 2006 and of course it came out
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:10.840]  in the new york times that the bush administration was overseeing a lot of these programs he put a
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:16.520]  block in place which prevented the nsa from really hammering down on the full complete
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:21.960]  panopticon surveillance of the american people so he's been an individual who has set himself
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:28.040]  against surveillance since as far back as 2006 and now he's saying that americans should be deeply
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:34.440]  skeptical of government of course under the dhs's definitions that probably makes him a terrorist
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:41.800]  member the 2011 study uh university study funded by the dhs which said quote liberty lovers
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:48.760]  were in league with terrorists well now the fbi director is voicing similar rhetoric but david
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.040]  and i his point about surveillance as it relates to the iphone to cell phones in general you say
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.440]  that he's contradicting himself yeah i think people should be deeply skeptical of his statements
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.840]  linking himself with the founders i i hope he's sincere about that but then he goes on to say
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:08.200]  that he has a real problem with what apple and google are doing he says if you're going to block
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.320]  that that's like creating a car with a trunk that i can never open even if i get a court order now
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:18.760]  he's saying that for this to be done legally people need to go to a judge and get a court order to
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:24.760]  show what they want to search for and of course we all know that we also all know that the government
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:31.480]  hasn't done that for a very long time and nothing has been done to the people who have violated
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:37.960]  that law so as fbi director i would ask him if you're going to tell us that we have a constitution
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:44.840]  in place that is checks and balances that prohibits this then where are you when we have government
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:50.120]  officials violating their oath to the constitution and searching without warrants if he wants to
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.600]  start enforcing that then we can talk about the rest of this stuff but quite frankly when the
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.840]  government disobeys the law i think we should be deeply skeptical of somebody who starts quoting
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:04.040]  the founding fathers and doesn't do anything to enforce the constitution the way this is going
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.840]  to go paul is that what we're seeing if it even works i'm not sure at this point i'm deeply distrust
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:13.800]  full of the technology companies as well but if apple and google's strategy really is secure
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:20.040]  they're doing that as a pr stunt because they have to sell their products internationally
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:24.440]  and internationally people don't want the united states government looking at them either
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.680]  however the internet service providers and the cell pavone providers that are here in this country
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.160]  they are captive to the government they're dependent on the government for their entire
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.960]  business they have to do everything the government tells them to do even if your phone is secure
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.360]  the minute you're sending or receiving information to your internet service provider or your cell
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:47.080]  phone company the government has a jack right there at that point they're going to intercept it
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.960]  they're going to store it at that point so a lot of this is a smoke screen but if he wants to talk
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.320]  about courts let's talk about the fiza court the fiza court was set up to stop the nsa from spying
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:04.360]  on american citizens and yet it's not a court by any means this is nothing more than a star chamber
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:09.560]  proceedings we have one judge and one person from the government telling the judge what they want
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:14.760]  he rubber stamps it there's no adversarial argument made from the other people the other side there
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.280]  is no jury there's nothing just a single judge and a government official coming in and saying i
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.800]  want you to do this and he says in almost all cases yes i don't know if there's any cases they
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.600]  have a record where he they were turned down the pies the court gives them anything that they want
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:35.240]  any way that they want to surveil the american people and again it's you know whether people
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.120]  still care about surveillance you know if you've got nothing to hide well you know give me your email
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.400]  password give me the access to your bank account they tend to get um very reticent to hand over that
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.280]  information if you phrase it in that way and yet they're quite happy to have the convenience of the
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.840]  iphone and give away all their secrets to nsa surveillance which is a subject we're going to
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:05:02.440]  cover with wane manson after the break stay tuned in for wars.com Alex Jones here to tell you about

[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.280]  welcome to the show i got to be with you paul thanks for being here first off i mean we're
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.840]  going to get into isis soon i wanted to get your quick take i don't know how closely you've been
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:07.240]  following it on the ebola outbreak of course because we've had this botched response from the
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:12.840]  cdc it seems the first two cases there in dallas do you think that this is merely
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.960]  incompetence on behalf of the public health authorities or are we seeing some kind of
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:25.640]  deliberate malfeasance well i you know i just returned from a conference in tehran last week
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:32.120]  and of course tehran uh in my mind was going to be a great place to find out all about
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  isol or isis uh or whatever you want to call this group but i actually discovered some things
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:45.160]  about ebola while i was there which i didn't think i would in that particular venue first of all
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:54.600]  one of my colleagues dr randy short uh produced a patent for the ebola virus from the us patent
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:10:01.080]  and trademark office that it was patented a few years ago uh has a barcode on it it's a government
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:07.800]  document that was a little bit surprising but was what was even more surprising is when i took a tour
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:15.080]  through the um former uh torture chambers of the dreaded shah secret police the savak and
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:22.360]  discovered that the head of that particular unit a guy named parvez sabati uh has been living here
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:30.040]  in the united states for over 30 years uh in orlando uh operating a business out of a p o box and
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:36.920]  out of private residences and his daughter uh who serves on his board for one of these uh companies
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:44.200]  that uh doesn't have a real address um it turns out that she was responsible at harvard she's a
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:51.400]  harvard biologist for mapping the ebola virus from an animal gene pool to the human gene pool
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:57.560]  now you know you you put the patent together with that kind of information uh you know here's somebody
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:03.960]  whose father was a brutal torture and you have to wonder what is behind the sudden outbreak of
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:10.520]  ebola which we had an outbreak in zaire it's actually called the zaire ebola virus some years
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:16.600]  ago but it was eradicated in zaire now tango democrat republic tango how come in all of a sudden
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:23.720]  appears um in these three west african countries that have been rife with civil wars and coup
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:30.600]  des tas uh brought about mostly by countries that are after their natural resources gold
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:38.760]  diamonds and um and iron and uh and of course uh israel figures very big in that operation they've
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:44.040]  been responsible for um an attempt to overthrow the government of guinea and they were involved
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:50.120]  in supplying both sides in the very bloody civil wars in both livery and syria leon i'm very i'm
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:57.320]  very suspicious about the ebola and especially where we saw the outbreak in the hot zones right
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:03.720]  now in those three countries let's turn to isis then because over the weekend we had isis almost
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:10.600]  taking the town of kobani in syria the making advances in west and bagdad i mean the us offensive
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.280]  against isis the airstrikes only seem to have bolstered isis now they're expanding the their
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:22.680]  spread throughout the region isn't that the case yeah and you know where who is this isis um i i
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:30.600]  spoke to islamic uh scholars in tehran who said this group has no uh absolutely nothing to do with
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:38.120]  islam has a lot to do of course with uh saudi arabia uh which practices a very heretical form of
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:46.600]  islam known as uh wahhabism uh they they on the other hand uh look at any other islamic sect
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:56.840]  whether she is a sufi or even other sunni uh sex is um as apestates and and heretics but this uh
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:03.400]  this wahhabist uh sect was born out of uh the british foreign office and and the during the
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:11.400]  ottoman reign it's it's not real islam and and then you look at isle um and uh you look at the
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:17.800]  fact that there's eight and twelve thousand foreign mercenaries from 81 different countries
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:24.520]  including united states canada many in western europe who have no affiliation through marriage
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.680]  or family or anything with islam and you have to wonder what is what is isle is this
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:39.160]  uh actually the implementation of something known as the uh yinon plan uh formulated in 1982 by
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:45.960]  an israeli journalist named um um oded yinon which talked about uh breaking apart the other
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.480]  arab countries surrounding israel into warring factions and and that's exactly what we're seeing
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:58.200]  today in syria and iraq and look who's been promoting uh these rebels neocons like john mccain
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.280]  and and the other neocons in the state department the same people who brought about the uh the the
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:10.120]  total destruction of iraq as a nation that's who's uh behind isle and then you look at these
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.400]  demonstrations against africans and tel Aviv and other parts of israel and by these right wing
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:22.200]  settlers and they're all wearing isle t-shirts and waving the isle flag uh they even found a bag of
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:28.520]  isle flags some gardeners found a bag of isle flags brand new flags uh that fallen off a truck in
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:36.520]  northern israel i would suggest that isle is a is an operation that was formulated by the uh us
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:44.200]  cia the mosad and sally intelligence in the person of prince bandar and we know how dirty he is
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.920]  especially uh his names all over those missing 28 pages from that senate the joint senate
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.840]  intelligence report on 9 11 uh so here here are the real enemies of the united states and we're
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:02.840]  told by idiots like john mccain that they are our allies i'm afraid not because on september 11th
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:09.000]  the leading eastern christian patriarchs met with president obama in the white house and told him
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.800]  there was no such thing as syrian moderate rebels that his support for the syrian opposition
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:23.560]  had led and would lead to uh deaths amongst syrian christians and other minorities and and
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:30.920]  the same group was then uh spoken to by uh ted cruz who's a christian zionist and by the way
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:36.280]  many christians and even islamic people well versed in the new testament told me in tehran
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:45.000]  that the idea of christian zionism is a heresy uh to christian religion it's a heresy uh to the
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.320]  teachings of jesus and and the and what is in the new testament and there's no place in christian
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:57.000]  you can't be a zionist and a christian at the same time so i have news for people like ted cruz uh
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.520]  he better make a decision on what he wants to be he can't be both and i would even suggest he can't
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:09.000]  be president he was born in canada so his rhetoric uh is not helpful to this debate uh we see uh
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.280]  about what's going on in the middle east right now we have a story here out of bbc news turkey
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:19.720]  allows syria rebel training turkey has agreed to allow moderate syrian rebels to be trained on
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.720]  its soil the usas in its bid to combat the islamic islamic state and syria and iraq we've also got
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:31.560]  saudi arabia training those so-called moderate rebels we've got the united states sending them
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:39.000]  more money more arms and yet we know that these arms in many cases fell directly into the hands
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.640]  of isis and in fact those so-called moderate rebels defected to and joined up with isis and gave them
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.480]  those arms that they had received from the likes of jordan katar and saudi arabia in addition to
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:58.520]  turkey so wane i mean to what extent is the us policy in syria of destabilizing the asad regime
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:05.320]  responsible for the growth of isis absolutely connected to the growth of iso or isis or as the
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:12.440]  arab's called dash um this group um there first of all uh we know that mccain uh with this fake
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:21.320]  phd elizabeth o baggy went into syria last year and met with al bagdadi the head of isis they
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:28.360]  their picture was taken with him and um they're trying to dance around this issue but these um
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:37.160]  these isis isle guys are uh basically um paid for by the kataris and the saudi's as a matter of fact
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:44.840]  this this coalition of obama is a joke because we're told that saudi and emirati and katari
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:51.320]  and bahraini pilots are flying missions against this group in iraq and syria when in fact i was
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:18:02.520]  told by a syrian uh who was in tehran with me um that the brand huge packages of cash um
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:10.200]  have arrived in isle hands in aleppo in syria and complete with the saudi and katari bank stamps
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:17.560]  on the wrappers around the cash so uh this has to be the first time that we've seen a military attack
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.360]  groups that they're also financing uh they're kind of their own governments are financing
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:28.360]  the whole things are ruse i'm afraid that the u.s is not attacking isle positions it's attacking
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:36.680]  syrian uh military positions Assad positions for example um the u.s claims it attacked the city of
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:44.120]  raka in the eastern syria it was two days after isle forces left the city so we see this time
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:51.000]  the u.s also attacked a syrian air force base that had not been taken over by isle it was in the
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.320]  hands of the syrian air force i i would suggest that either obama is lying to the american people
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:03.560]  or his own military and intelligence services are not telling him what uh what's going on on the
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:10.360]  ground over there um perhaps uh he should send private emissaries over there as i was in tehran
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:16.600]  he should send people to Damascus and to tehran and to beirut and find out himself what's going on
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:22.520]  over there those those uh eastern christian uh patriarch certainly told him and he seemed
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:28.440]  surprised when he said oh there's no such thing as syrian moderate rebels uh he seemed surprised
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.120]  at that and this guy's supposed to be intelligent and he's surprised by that i i i'm i'm surprised
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.560]  that he's surprised we'll be back with wane madsen after the break we're gonna get into the

[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:47.080]  at bagdad airport the u.s. embassy in bagdad may soon fall prey to isis they have the area
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:54.040]  surrounded and they're armed with anti aircraft missiles thanks to our friends the saudi arabians
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:25:00.680]  once again we're going to get into saudi arabia's alliance with israel according to wane madsen
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.400]  coming up later in the show but i just wanted to ask wane about these beheading videos we had
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.480]  another hostage video supposedly produced by isis yesterday of the british journalist john
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:19.000]  cantlay wane you know given that these videos they only seem to bolster the case for us military
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.920]  expansion in the region they bolster the case for airstrikes targeting isis very emotional
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:31.560]  propaganda again a lot of questions have been asked about these videos should we be suspicious
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:37.080]  as to their origin given previous examples of so-called al-qaeda videos which lead back to the
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:43.800]  pentagon yes absolutely as a matter of fact that it seems like these videos are quote unquote
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:49.880]  discovered by an organization in washington that i've been looking at for a number of years called
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:57.240]  the search for international terrorist entities or site it's actually run by an israeli iraqi
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:03.880]  american named uh read a catz and listen they they were the ones who discovered a lot of these
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:09.560]  fake bin london videos and now they're discovering these beheading videos i'm not suggesting that
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:17.080]  these people who have been killed ostensibly by beheading are not dead but i i think it's
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:24.120]  somewhat questionable as to whether they they actually were beheaded live and the the whole
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:31.000]  the whole thing looks like a you know a bad grade p movie and i think there's been some
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.600]  video forensics people have looked at these videos and determined that there's a lot of
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:44.760]  fakery involved with their production but you know after we saw the us cia compounds stormed in
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:51.320]  banghazi after the production of that trailer called the innocence of muslims which was uh
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:58.280]  uh involved a lot of uh us the dodgy people in los angeles including those in the porn industry
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:03.800]  you have to wonder where where are these videos coming from what is the intention and are they
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:12.760]  what they are purported to be i i have serious doubts about the uh the the uh whether these
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:18.760]  videos are in fact showing the headings although i must say i believe that those hostages are
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:24.760]  uh are probably dead unfortunately i mentioned saudi arabia earlier regarding their arming of
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:30.280]  isis with anti aircraft missiles you've got a new book out the star and the sword which alleges this
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.600]  alliance between saudi arabia and israel which was intimately involved in plotting the 911 attacks
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:42.040]  it gives us a rundown of some of that evidence and how this came to fruition regarding the connection
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:49.960]  to 911 saudi saudi arabia and israel well when i was actually on the trail of the the perps behind
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:56.760]  911 the one issue that came up is you know i was looking at the the location of the 19
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:04.120]  uh uh legend hijackers i was also looking at the location of about 120 israeli
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.440]  art students they weren't really art students they were obviously uh intelligence officers
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:17.080]  and agents over here in the months leading up to 911 uh that they were identified in a drug
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:22.040]  enforcement administration report as being involved in some sort of intelligence operation
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:28.680]  united states i was looking at the the fact that they were they and the 19 hijackers were living
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:35.320]  in the same locations in places like hollywood florida uh urving texas near dallas fort worth
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:45.000]  their international airport uh in north jersey um very close to new york city um in places like
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:52.600]  jersey city for example outside of washington dc and and laurel maryland and and other locations
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.320]  and and the problem was were you know the was it the case where the israelis were monitoring the
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:07.000]  hijackers uh and if so why didn't they inform us and and you know the obviously knowing the
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.960]  relationship the close relationship between saudi arabia and israel one of the has existed
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:20.120]  since after uh predates israel itself when um the first modern saudi king even saud sent a
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:27.080]  letter to uh haim viceman the head of the world zionist organization saying look uh we have no
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:31.640]  problem that we sal's with you establishing a homeland for the jewish people in the british
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:37.240]  mandate of palestine uh it starts from there and obviously this was not a case where the israelis
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:44.040]  were monitoring um those uh hijackers they were providing material support and cover for those

[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.320]  for wane madsen here in a minute just before the break wane was talking about the connection between
[01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:44.840]  israel saudi arabia and 911 wane just finish up your thoughts on that subject the alliance the
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:51.400]  involvement in 911 well you know what people would say well why would saudi arabia support 911
[01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:58.200]  because you know 15 of the 19 alleged hijackers were saudi nationals but we we've seen this
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:06.520]  time and time again the saudi arabians have of course paid bin laden off not to attack the kingdom
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:12.520]  and and all of saudi arabia's national security infrastructure is geared to one thing protection
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:19.560]  of the royal family and they and israel and saudi arabia always have had common enemies
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:27.400]  and the big one right now is iran where i just returned from uh even saudi arabia has provided
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:33.720]  basing agreements and forward location storage areas for israeli weapons in the event israel
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:42.120]  the site decides to strike iran and their legend nuclear facilities which i basically ascertained
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:48.520]  there is no nuclear weapons program in iran the cia was right in 2003 when they made that
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:54.520]  determination and that determination is still valid and anything that yad who says the contrary is
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:01.880]  just typical propaganda from him and people who support him and his government but the saudi's
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:08.120]  the qatari's the bahrainis the emirates and and the israelis all have the same common enemy and
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:15.400]  isil is not going to stop at the iranian iraqi border that there already are reports that isil
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:22.120]  units are inside iran and that they're cooperating with these mek muja hadini calc terrorists that
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:28.200]  were once supported by the u.s and iraq and they of course are supported by leading neocons like
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:34.760]  richard pearl and and rudy juliani so here again we see the same players involved the same people
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:41.880]  that benefited from 9 11 now benefiting from this isil rampage across the middle east and
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:48.440]  the total destruction of the modern arab nation states which is has always been in the
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:55.480]  interest of saudi arabia to get rid of the secular governments of iraq and syria and of course iran
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:01.320]  is next on that list and also the israelis who always wanted to see uh Arabs kill Arabs and
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:07.880]  muslims kill muslims because that blood they they actually profit when there's that kind of blood
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  shed so basically isis are pawns that they can move around the globe move around the middle east
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.240]  to justify military intervention they're not even muslims they claim they're muslims they claim
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:25.880]  they're establishing a caliphate as a matter of fact i spoke to representatives of hamas islamic jihad
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:33.880]  and hezbollah and tiran and all three groups stated that that this isil is not islamic and they
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:39.960]  consider them to be an enemy of these groups and uh and for netanyahu to suggest that hamas and isil
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:45.400]  are the same thing he's lying again the only thing that man knows how to do is lie if we wanted allies
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:52.760]  to fight isil if obama wants a real coalition we should make peace with Assad and join him
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:59.000]  and the government of iran and then also supply weapons to hamas hezbollah and islamic jihad
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.240]  because they will go in and wipe these guys clean if we uh work this but that's not that you know
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:10.360]  that's my dream team to get rid of isil but of course it's not going to happen because our foreign
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:17.240]  policy has been hijacked by uh external interests interests that do not have the national security
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.200]  concerns of this country first at hand okay we're going to go to your calls now
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:28.120]  janaro in arizona you're on the air go ahead yes thank you paul thank you david and wane for
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:35.160]  taking my call you know a couple of things you hear the fbi director james comey criticizing
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:43.000]  apple and google um about developing encryptions to secure um so secure that that even police and
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.240]  the nsa can't even access i mean i just think that is the most ludicrous absurd statement
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:58.360]  to make especially on the heels of the icloud um photo scandal it's obvious that like like you said
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.760]  david that was a smoke screen because apple needs to sell their products and and he
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:08.600]  tim cook came out and admitted and said you know oh our phones are so secure the ios ad
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:14.680]  we can't even give you information now i mean wane my question for you is regardless of of
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.160]  any kind of encryption if the nsa or the government wants to get to your information
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.560]  they're going to get it and i'm sure that they have very sophisticated ways of getting it wirelessly
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:29.480]  they're not going to need you know a warrant to go and get information from apple or google so
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:35.320]  what is your comment on that yeah this is a battle uh i fought with the other privacy
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:41.000]  advocates back in the 90s uh some people may recall the clinton administration's plan to
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.800]  implement something called a clipper chip where you you would be able to encrypt your data but
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.200]  you would have to give your encryption key over to the government who would then share it with
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.960]  nsa or the fbi if they had it they said if they had a court order that that we didn't believe that
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:39:01.720]  that was the mechanism they were going to use and uh this is comey is just like louis free
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:09.240]  was back in those battles in the 90s they want they do not want encryption used by private
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:16.280]  citizens or businesses because they want to have real-time access to encrypted communications
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.160]  without going through any steps but you're right nsa given enough time they're building this huge
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:26.760]  super computer at oak ridge tennessee by the way that will be able to decrypt anything within
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:31.800]  probably seconds uh but uh yeah if they wanted they're going to get it but the people that are
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:37.160]  penalized if you suggest and not that i you know i'm i'm interested in the bottom line of google
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:43.960]  or um or apple but it does hurt their foreign sales when there are these uh restrictions placed
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:50.120]  on encryption and also they're domestic sales for people that are worried about their uh their
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:58.200]  private data uh being compromised and uh i had to laugh i was recently uh looking at at some ads
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:04.520]  inside the dc metro and they were advertising government clouds like that's some sort of
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:09.560]  security for these government agencies it was atnt actually it was advertising it i i can't
[01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:14.520]  think of anything more ludicrous than a government putting its sensitive data in a cloud i can't
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:20.280]  believe anybody would put their sensitive data in a cloud thanks for the call also wane there was a
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:25.800]  comment by google's eric schmitt a couple of days ago he gave a speech saying that basically nsa
[01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:30.840]  surveillance threatens to break the internet now this was the same guy who said if you have something
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:35.000]  that you don't want anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place i mean is it a
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.760]  sign that the nsa surveillance has so destabilized the very structure of the internet that even people
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:47.160]  like eric schmitt are now paranoid that it could break the entire uh worldwide web well perhaps maybe
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.520]  eric schmitt should have uh discussed this with keith alexander at the several builderberg meetings
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:57.560]  they attended together maybe he should have uh expressed his concerns then before this got out
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:05.400]  of hand but yeah it's typical these ceo's from uh the silicon valley companies and you know and all
[01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:12.920]  these other high tech companies uh at first they defend um uh you know nsa or at least they don't
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:17.640]  say anything critical of them and then they find out oh my god it's worse than i thought but you
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:23.320]  know i mean yeah he he had more than enough opportunity to make these concerns known personally
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:29.960]  that alexander and i'm sure he will in the future when alexander's replacement admiral mike rogers
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.960]  attends these same conclaves it seems like builderberg loves to have the the nsa director at all
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.920]  their meetings these days so lech schmitt and the other uh these other high tech gurus uh
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:45.640]  complain to them in person at the next one jay jay in texas you're on the air with wane mattson go
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.400]  ahead jay jay hey mr mattson good to talk to you today how's it going over there good how are you
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:58.440]  i'm doing great i have a comment about 9 11 since that came up um isn't it strange uh that our
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:05.480]  government flew out the family of the wanted hijacker behind 9 11 osama bedlot and all his
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:12.200]  family got to fly out isn't that a false flag there number one and number two uh isn't it true
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:20.120]  that pakistan's intelligence is called isi yes so is there any correlation between isis and pakistan
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:27.320]  uh that's not determined except uh one thing i i i discovered in iran that uh we we now know
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:34.120]  that isil is crossing over the iraqi border into iran using some uh kind of open smuggling routes
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:40.200]  in the kurdish area uh in the northern part of iran where where uh a lot of stuff that's
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:47.960]  basically illegal in iran is smuggled by mostly armenian businessmen things like beer for example
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:54.120]  and at isil's using the same smuggling routes to get their people across at the same time pakistan
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:59.960]  and um uh there's a group there called junda law which is a baluchi uh terrorist groups that's
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:04.760]  supported by the united states uh depending on what day of the week it is and how much money's
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:11.960]  being paid off by the cia this junda law will make uh forays into iran and commit terrorist attacks
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:18.360]  now pakistan sometimes cracks down on this group and that's isi that's the pakistani intelligence
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:24.920]  service but uh other times if they if they're paid off um they they leave this group alone so
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:32.600]  that's the only uh but you can see the problem if isil attack it goes into iran from the west
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:39.560]  and junda law decides to go in from the east uh that's that's sort of a pincir action and and
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:48.440]  then with the mek active also on the border um obviously uh we could see this uh situation spreading
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:55.800]  to iran uh in a very bad way uh as far as the bin Laden family was flown out of the united states
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:00.120]  so there wasn't really the you know that we were told there was a snow fly policy there were there
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:07.880]  were a lot of planes flying after 9 11 we weren't told about one of which was the uh 747 it took uh
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:14.360]  uh took the bin Laden family and dropped them off in paris in geneva uh and they flew in from
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:21.080]  various locations around the country uh yeah we protected bin Laden's family but we did very
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:26.920]  little to protect the uh first responders who have died and are very sick in in new york and
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:33.080]  washington dc jojo thanks for the call vac in wisconsin you're on the air with wane madsen go
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:41.880]  ahead vac vac's gone we've got tom in new jersey you're on the air tom go ahead good day mr madsen
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:49.640]  and mr watson uh my question mr madsen is the uh mr duncan in uh dallas texas they're calling him
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:56.520]  pace and zero but uh pace and zero happened last year in december and uh guinea i believe uh was
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:03.880]  a two-year-old boy um the origin of a bullet they're trying to say is either of course infected uh
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:12.360]  animal corpses or fruit bats but they leave out the last shell which could be of course a two-year-old
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:22.360]  boy getting uh vaccinations i tell you i you know when they when they talk about the guy and
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:28.040]  and who died mr duncan in texas is being patient zero obviously there are we we know that that
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.600]  there are there are now maybe five thousand people in west africa who have died of this
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:37.800]  disease and that may i may be global in that number we're not getting and for obama to send
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:43.400]  the military over to deal with a public health issue i really question whether african which was
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:50.040]  designed to protect us business interests oil interests and other interests in africa is is
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:56.840]  well placed to deal with this uh developing pandemic in in west africa so uh what one thing the
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:03.720]  military does do when they go into an area they they tend to keep um and and does he journalists
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:09.880]  out they put up an information what's called an information cone over the area where not no
[01:46:09.880 --> 01:46:16.040]  independent news goes out that's what i'm very skeptical and suspicious about with obama's deployment
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:21.480]  of troops into west africa okay thanks for the call yes i'm picking up on that way and i mean
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:27.320]  we've seen chinese economic expansion in africa outstripping the us so do you believe that this
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.400]  Ebola outbreak and other so-called crises like that are being used as pretext to send us troops
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:39.160]  into the region to establish strongholds that will later benefit economically the us military
[01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:43.880]  industrial complex in that region it could very well be you know we're already in there to fight
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.880]  these uh groups that are active now west africa as a result of our the neocons foolhardy uh
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.680]  project to you know get rid of qaddafi and libya that just turned out all this this weaponry
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:47:03.160]  and these jihadists who are now active in mali and brikina faso and nijer and with boko haram in
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:10.840]  nigeria and ansardine and northern mali uh and other in other countries so the these american
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:16.840]  troops are supplementing troops that are already in in in west africa now you know that the one
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:24.920]  country that has provided top shelf medical care to west africa is cuba and we know because of this
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:31.560]  ridiculous uh quarenta boycott we've had against cuba they've developed this uh a medical system
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:38.200]  that is far beyond anything we have in the united states that's affordable and uh they have dispatched
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:45.720]  their doctors to west africa and so cuba dispatches top quality doctors and we send the military in
[01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:51.720]  i mean uh you know you you get you just got to wonder uh who's in charge of things in washington
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:59.080]  dc um and when um you know and and the people in west africa know that when and that they see these
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:03.640]  cuban doctors are getting that they're gonna start getting the best medical care available
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:09.640]  and i don't care what iliana ross latin and her gang of uh guzzanos in south florida have to say
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.920]  about it uh those cubans are needed in west africa and we should we if anything we should be using
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:21.880]  our military planes to fly more cuban doctors over there switching topics now ukraine i know this
[01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:27.480]  is something you've been focusing on in the past we've seen a kind of quieting of tensions in recent
[01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:33.400]  weeks we've had a ceasefire putin withdrawing troops from eastern ukraine do you see that crisis
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:39.800]  as ebbing away or is it going to spark back into life here in the near future well that crisis is
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:47.240]  now going from sort of the battlefield to the um corporate boardrooms uh uh throughout europe and
[01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:53.320]  also the middle east because winter is now approaching and this idea of sanctions on russia
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:59.720]  which affects their ability to ship their natural gas and other energy supplies to western europe
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:07.560]  is really starting to impact on on western europe and we already seen uh now unemployment rise in
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:13.960]  germany as a result of this uh ill-conceived uh of sanctions these ill-conceived sanctions against
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:19.880]  russia or french farmers are now dumping their produce that they would normally sell to russia
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:27.160]  in town squares and uh all we get from france while along the french president is uh uh more
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:35.720]  talk about uh more eu sanctions look that was a coup d'etat uh in kiev by a bunch of neo-nazis
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:44.920]  and and and um the fascists um and it was victorian newland uh at the state department
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:53.400]  who promoted that and now we have a west german i mean a german um news report that um the the
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:50:01.080]  ukrainian army uh they wear helmets uh with swastikas and ss symbols on them i mean this is
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:07.400]  you know no wonder russia russia doesn't you do something like that and russia remembers what
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:15.560]  happened in world war two you know 25 million soviet citizens lost their lives as a result of the
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:24.440]  german nazi attack on on russia and to have ukrainian troops wearing nazi helmets uh going into
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:31.160]  kill russian speaking people in eastern ukraine uh i would have reacted as much as putin did
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:36.360]  and uh he secured that russian base in Crimea where there's a majority russian population
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:42.360]  we we would have done the same thing if one of our overseas military bases were put in jeopardy
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:49.880]  uh and um he took that base without firing a shot nobody died of course if we did we'd do
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:55.480]  shock and all and we'd kill a lot of civilians so who's who's the more civilized person here

[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:52.440]  spoken to you about this before about uh how big blackmail is in how so many of these political
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:57.960]  actors are you know pretty much hold to a news because of blackmail than we know our good friend
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:05.000]  barry cittoro and his uh relationships with mr sinclair or reggie love uh all of these actors
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:10.040]  are blackmail can you elaborate on that and secondly vice media i know that you've written
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:16.200]  so many articles on your website about vice and you know they have uh uncle uncle rupert rupert's
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.800]  money as well as uncle george's money soros and murdoch behind it they covered uh ukraine you
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:26.600]  talked about the neo nazis it's not surprising vice media would go with would support what was
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:32.280]  happening in ukraine when senator mccain openly spoke at the brookings institute with senator
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:38.360]  murphy of connecticut about a technocracy in ukraine and we know how uh technocratic regimes
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:44.360]  in greece and italy have worked thus far can you elaborate on those two issues yeah on vice of course
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:53.080]  that's also involves bill marr who produces their uh program on hbo and and i just would caution people
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:58.680]  about the news reports coming out of north korea about the status of kim jong-un don't believe
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.920]  them because a lot of them are being filtered through vice and and you know they were the ones
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:08.520]  who accompanied denis rodman over there on his trip uh take that take whatever they say with
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:14.040]  a grain of salt we know that bill marr is an is is an islamopho we know that thank god ben afleck
[01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:20.520]  called him and that other clown uh sam harris out on their islamophobia on uh on the uh marr
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:28.360]  program uh but uh yeah vice uh not not to be believed that it's just it's more trash journalism
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  on on blackmail oh yes absolutely you mentioned mccain and what do they got on this guy i mean
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  obviously he's blackmail three waves from sunday they know he was singing like a canary to his north
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:48.440]  vietnamese captors for six months he he was giving uh operational schedules for us uh uh uh flights uh
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:55.640]  attack uh flights into north vietnam um he also was responsible for the terrible fire on us as
[01:57:55.640 --> 01:58:03.240]  forestall that killed uh you know over 200 uh naval personnel and he was the first guy taken off
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:09.080]  because they knew he was responsible because of his hot shot antics they call him johnny wet start
[01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:15.880]  because he would uh flame his uh engine out as a form of hazing and he caused that uh that
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.680]  catastrophe so yeah they got that on him and they got a lot of other stuff for mccain he's just one
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:28.440]  of many mark kirk uh look i reported he you know it it came out after he his his marriage uh uh went

[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:43.320]  your calls right now the website for wane by the way is wane madsen report dot com we're gonna go to
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:51.160]  austin in michigan you're on the air go ahead austin hey how's it going guys good go ahead i was uh
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:55.480]  i was calling about uh a little number of things one of the things i wanted to ask about uh i was
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:00.440]  thinking about russia and and ukraine as well as uh ebola and stuff could that also be like you
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:05.640]  know a preset kind of a fog of war for things that might possibly go and be going on in north korea
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:13.800]  or china the china's trying to do well i could one thing about isle that i also discovered
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:18.920]  from talking to cop journalist colleagues and they gathered in tehran for this journalism
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:27.960]  and many professors were there as scholars and whatnot is that isle's leadership was
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:36.040]  uh controlled by some north africans and uh a couple weeks ago uh the cia and their other
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:44.440]  controllers went in and uh had uh checkins from the republic of georgia and weagers from western
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:52.200]  china basically killed uh their mostly tunisian commanders they actually beheaded them in syria
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:58.920]  and they took over and the idea is that the the checkins from georgia and the weagers from
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:06.760]  western china after they take care of iraq and syria in iran are going to go after russia and
[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:13.880]  china respectively so there there's more to this whole isle story than we're being told
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:20.280]  and i think that all the all the suspicion should go on cia director john brennan who
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.520]  made the pilgrimage to mecca he's very close to the saudi regime uh he's the guy who's been
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:33.160]  promoting these radical talk theories in isle and he's the guy who really needs to have his head
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:39.000]  on a stake uh and and no one else because he's the guy who is ultimately responsible for this group
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.640]  being created anthony and florida you're on the air go ahead quick question yes i have two questions
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:52.760]  for mr mad only time for one make it quick okay okay um what does he think of the um
[02:02:54.200 --> 02:03:00.680]  what does he think of the fact that um does he believe that china at some point or like my challenge
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:07.400]  the united states in the same way that germany challenged the british emperor no i think china
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:13.720]  is actually look china's history recent history they have never really attacked anybody except when
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.560]  they felt their security was threatened the attack on north britain and the korean war
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:23.400]  was because we posed a threat to them uh they are staking a claim to the south china sea
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:30.920]  just like we state claims to our territorial waters uh it's all about natural gas and oil
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:38.920]  and obama decided to pivot uh to asia as a direct confrontation military confrontation against china
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:45.160]  in china's own backyard it's asia is not our backyard it's china's backyard but obama has
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:51.720]  just decided he's going to not only take on russia with ukraine and other former soby republics
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:57.720]  he's going to take on china in its own waters its own backyard obama is playing with nuclear fire
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:03.800]  by going after russia and china and uh i'm afraid that whoever comes after him whether it's hillary
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:09.720]  or some uh knucklehead republican is going to continue those policies unless we get a president
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:16.680]  like a jim webb or a rand paul who doesn't want to continue this intervention as us foreign policy

[02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:30.040]  we're back live on the alex jonesharm joined in studio by anthony gucciardi who had an
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:36.280]  interesting experience this past weekend in houston with grope down procedures being conducted
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:42.280]  outside of music concerts of course we've seen that back before in 2012 we had a report where the
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.960]  detroit music festival was staffed by these individuals who carried out tsa style grope
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:53.400]  downs we're going to talk about that ebola we're going to go to more of your calls at 1800 259
[02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:59.720]  92 31 anthony tell us about this experience this past weekend well it's amazing to me that no matter
[02:08:59.720 --> 02:09:04.760]  what you're doing it seems that you cannot escape the police state you cannot escape being treated
[02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:10.520]  like a terrorist in the way that they once said that these groping protocols i'm talking about
[02:09:10.520 --> 02:09:14.760]  flashlights looking down your pants and there's photos we're going to show you if you're watching
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:22.840]  live on prisonplanet.tv or infowords.com slash show but overall you cannot escape being groped
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:27.880]  and treated like a terrorist and what happened was i was convinced hey you know with some friends
[02:09:27.880 --> 02:09:33.000]  let's go see this show let's go see a major show it's outside of houston at this pavilion
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.120]  and i actually thought the whole premise was it's a distraction right get away from all of this get
[02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.280]  away just for a couple of hours from the whole spectrum of the police state and all of this
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:49.640]  research so not only though is there a two hour line to get in about two hour lines sitting there
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:55.640]  waiting because of these security agents which is a private security firm led by these police
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:01.640]  that were going back and forth but what was happening was it was a tsa style search i'm talking
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:07.240]  about and we're going to show you having people take their shoes off lifting your shirt up up
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:13.080]  to about your nipple area them going in with flashlights grabbing your pants and boxers pulling
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:19.480]  them back looking in and there's meanwhile there's speaker system saying like stay in an order to
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:25.080]  lead line you will be searched according to the security protocols of this pavilion you know just
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:30.520]  worthless bureaucracy and all these security quote-unquote agents are like nothing against them
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:37.000]  just you know 70 year old man that probably couldn't work at walmart going in and searching you and
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.600]  just asking the same questions do you have anything on your person that's not allowed in the venue
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:44.760]  and they just will pull your pants back with a flashlight and search you and there was an older
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:50.040]  guy next to us who was really nice and he just was like oh yes i haven't you know been to such a
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:55.080]  venue in a while he was walking through and they're like okay sir take your shoes off he had a cane
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.680]  he couldn't even walk and he had to bend down someone's trying to help him take his shoes off
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:03.800]  they didn't even help him at all one of his some woman had to help him and we had been saying
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:08.440]  things like you know this is insane and i went and i said look at this we'll look at this al-qaeda
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:13.560]  terrorist right here and it was the older guy right and i'm going to go into the story a little
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:17.960]  because there was a guy in front of me with a crew cut and he looked like a fed really but i
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:22.680]  didn't think anything of it i'm not always constantly saying fed fed fed but as it turns out
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:28.040]  we it was it was me and my my friend we were saying look at this you know racist over here being
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:31.960]  facetious look at this terrorist look at this al-qaeda operative this older gentleman trying
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.200]  to get through security while the guy in front of us didn't like that and he was with his wife
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:42.200]  and got one that can see yes exactly well he was saying to her you know no no this is good
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:46.040]  this is actually helping people blah blah but we kept saying like look at all these terrorists
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:49.800]  being facetious because we you know we weren't going to stand for those things about leaving
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:55.320]  so he goes up and actually tells his cop buddies oh those those guys are causing trouble over there
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:59.800]  so by the time we get up there not did they not only did they just search us with the whole
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.760]  make you take your shoes off or anything like that which they didn't make me take my shoes off
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:08.840]  because i acted like a subservient little peon but they double searched us i mean they were he was
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.240]  literally taking the flashlight and looking down my boxers meanwhile people are coming in from
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:18.360]  Ebola hit countries and getting absolutely no questions whatsoever receiving no treatment
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:23.400]  we had the doctor early we had the cnn news crew a week before that but god forbid Anthony you
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:28.360]  should try to go to a music concert and have fun then they'll be really on you i mean ridiculous
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:32.280]  well that's the whole point and it's i've actually wrote an article about it with some pictures you
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:39.480]  can see on info wars.com it just went up about four minutes ago the key thing here is not only is
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:44.200]  this a crazy enactment of the police state a crazy show of power worthless they're not catching
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:50.040]  terrorists i'll give them an amount of money if they caught a terrorist with isis that night
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:55.480]  now here's the thing they're not even screening the abola patients the abola victims that we
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:00.360]  know are coming from west africa or wherever they're not even screening them with a degree of
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:06.200]  scrutiny that they screened me to go into a concert exactly the people with abola that
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.960]  hypothetically they're saying you know it's so bad and i'd like to we talked about two weeks ago
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:14.440]  about it our predictions i think we have a clear view now we get into that too where the endgame
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:18.280]  is going to take colors to get their opinion but overall i think we finally understand
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:22.440]  where it's all going but they're not even screening people with a bola like this
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:26.840]  but they're going to make me take my shirt up and look down my boxes with a flashlight to go
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:32.040]  listen to some music yet they can come in and pose a threat as they claim potentially to millions
[02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.560]  millions could die from a bola patient since the nurses apparently in full hazmat gear can still
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.280]  get a bola but that's not a big issue no no it's not a big issue because they just leave the borders
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:48.120]  open joe biggs can go dress up as isis and cross the border uh o'keith can dress up as asama bin
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:52.280]  la and that's not an issue the real issue is people going to concerts or going to sporting events
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.480]  and trying to bring in a can of high fructose corn syrup soda to the movie theater which will get
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:03.160]  you arrested and another side issue on that what does it say about people who take these jobs i mean
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:08.600]  that is basically the the slag heap of humanity that they're forced to take those kind of jobs
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:12.440]  are they not even good enough for tsa at this point no it is the slag heap it's the runoff
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:18.440]  of everything it's the bureaucracy because here's how it works i've been i've flown multiple times
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:25.000]  recently actually i have to fly all the time now and sometimes i'll have a tsa agent professional
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.680]  they will actually be like hey you know i know you went off to out it's not a big deal it's it's
[02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:32.360]  smart yeah no they'll actually get in the like sorry we have to do this but other times i've
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:36.520]  had people say why are you opting out and i say well i don't want to go through the naked body
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.680]  scanners that save your image and actually admit you with radiation they go oh yeah okay uh-huh
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:45.160]  and they actually they'll look they'll they are supposed to call it they're supposed to say opt
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.560]  out and you go through the line and you know someone comes and pass you down like a good slave
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:54.200]  but what they'll do is they'll wait like 30 minutes they make an exemplary oh yeah and then they'll
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:57.960]  do the pat down if they're the same gender and they'll just pay you down they'll be like do you
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:01.640]  have any sensitive areas just like pushing you really hard they just they just love it so there's
[02:15:01.640 --> 02:15:07.640]  two types of people there is the horrible bureaucratic evil slag heat bad horrible people that are
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:13.240]  actually running some of this because they're mentally insane and statistically psych psychopaths
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.720]  and sociopaths rise up way quicker because they can fake emotion they can it's been studies about
[02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:22.760]  it when the first ones came out about two months ago they can fake emotion which interestingly
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:27.880]  people are attached to now those types of people are horrible but at the same time there are people
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:32.840]  working at those venues that just want a job that want to make 30 000 a year that live in the country
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.640]  and don't know what they're doing but either way they're still servicing the same purpose they're
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:43.720]  still doing the same task which is depleting us of every single piece of freedom that we still
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:47.880]  have while you can just run them across the border so that's the irony of it that's why
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:52.760]  most people are getting it though and we are winning because most people are saying this is
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:59.480]  ridiculous a two-year-old could see this a three-year-old could literally do a report on this
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:06.840]  and be 100 more intellectually capable than the cdc on all of this and the story is up on info
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:13.160]  wars dot com photos concert venues now search inside your pants tsa style concert security
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:18.680]  agents use flashlights in invasive search that took place just this past weekend we're going to go
[02:16:18.680 --> 02:16:25.000]  to some of your calls now tim in florida you're on the air go ahead tim uh yes good afternoon to both
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:32.200]  of you uh paul i'm sorry i missed mr madsen uh i wanted to agree with him on at the outset of
[02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:37.400]  your conversation he was talking about this comprehensive plan to break down all the nations
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:44.840]  the arab nations in the middle east but it goes way beyond that uh it was spelled out none other
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:51.400]  by than a by a man named ed who's saying you may remember this fella uh he wrote on the council
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:58.440]  on foreign relations the website in 2012 he wrote that the syrian fsa needs al qaeda now this is the
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:07.000]  same man who wrote just this last june a cfo article entitled the eu offers a model for unifying
[02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.200]  the middle east and paul i don't think you guys covered this i hope you guys can go back and look
[02:17:12.200 --> 02:17:17.240]  at this because this is i think one of the main keys not only do they want to break down those
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:24.760]  nations but they want to set up a middle east union and and this is spelled out in in many many
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:32.440]  references uh he had gone uh mr madsen had gone to tiran i understand and i'm sure he could verify
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:38.440]  that uh yeah that's interesting i mean we know there's a policy in syria to uh vulcanize the
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:42.680]  country basically that's part of the plan with isis to split into three different regions that
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:47.880]  would be more easily controlled under the us military industrial complex so that's definitely
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:52.840]  one of the agendas behind that let's go to dale in oregon he's a retired hazmat professional go
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:18:00.120]  ahead dale hi how's it going good what's your point today uh just my point is um some of the
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:06.280]  procedural things i see on the news that maybe the health care providers are doing that they might
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:12.600]  if i was them i would be consulting like a hazardous materials team or something like
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:17.080]  that to maybe go over their procedures because some of the things like when you saw the what do
[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:20.840]  you think about the way they handled the apartment i mean that was ridiculous surely wasn't it
[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.280]  well because it was so late i mean that was a little that was a little rugged i would say
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:32.840]  that's a pretty big foo pa on uh see uh you know is the cdc just extremely incompetent
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.280]  yeah they kind of dropped the ball on that one that's for sure i don't understand
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.800]  if it was government rhetoric that couldn't you know procedural rhetoric that couldn't get
[02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:48.440]  them out there or well what specifically are you finding with the cdc dropping the ball over and
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:52.520]  over again what are they doing that you as a retired hazmat professional are seeing them do
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:58.120]  well i don't know like i said i think they should utilize their assets more i mean
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:04.360]  houston hazmat is probably one of the premier hazmat teams in the country and i would be bringing
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:09.720]  those people in and reviewing their procedures and because and i like i was going to say the
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:16.360]  people that went into the apartment to clean it up went into the building or the room in a higher
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:24.120]  level of protection than what um what's called for and that's a fire department procedure hazmat
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:31.240]  procedure we always try to go over one level of protection they they were in uh level c protection
[02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:35.880]  which is kind of splash protection and you'll see the health care workers in a class c
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:41.000]  protection the fire department people that went and cleaned the room went into a level b
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:48.840]  and then there's another level a that is totally encapsulated totally on respirators on air
[02:19:49.800 --> 02:19:53.640]  nothing's getting in so okay we'll leave it there now thanks for the call coming up after

[02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:31.400]  kathy in california go go ahead you're on the air we're talking about a bowler and specifically
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:37.320]  what is the end game is this going to break out into a martial law style situation kathy go ahead
[02:24:37.320 --> 02:24:43.240]  okay uh hey i don't remember your name but thank you for taking my calls and i'm calling to bring
[02:24:43.240 --> 02:24:49.480]  up a couple of points as far as i know when bush was in office he uh with everything with a wreck
[02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:55.320]  he suspended the constitution now i'm not sure what that means i know what the word suspension
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:01.880]  means and as far as i know uh i don't know how to reinstate it i don't know what procedure it takes
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:07.320]  and i don't know if anybody in washington dc or any position there reinstated the constitution
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:11.240]  because people i'm hearing on the radio keep saying that we have to defend the constitution
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:17.960]  but if it's been suspended then it's no longer the same uh thing necessary to do do you understand
[02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:23.240]  my point yeah well i mean it's been watered down to such an extent now that you know de facto has
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:28.600]  been suspended there's talk of a constitutional convention coming up we've already got 34 states
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:32.680]  that have ratified that which is the minimum required obviously there's concern that other
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:38.760]  things could be inserted into that convention gun control etc but definitely that could be a solution
[02:25:38.760 --> 02:25:43.240]  i know alex has kind of moved more on board with that in recent years so that's interesting
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:48.120]  jay in colorado you're on the air you want to talk about Ebola treatments go ahead jay
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:54.360]  uh hey hey paul hey anthony i wanted to uh talk about uh well two main things i hadn't really
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:26:00.120]  heard talked about that much the as far as uh supplements um the first one is selenium it
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:05.880]  seems as though um the ebola virus at least maybe not this uh new strain but ebola in general seems
[02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:12.760]  to uh like really uh gorge itself on selenium deposits in people's cells and then it spreads
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:19.560]  when it doesn't get that um and uh i don't know i'm expecting that if this does spread that uh
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:25.320]  the price of selenium supplements might i don't know increase door cells might come out i'm not
[02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:30.840]  or might fell out i'm not sure on that i did an article about some of the research out there
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.800]  and when i i actually did the research on the research and it was very disappointing to me
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:41.880]  because what i found was this early 2009 they were doing some serious trials on things like
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:48.280]  genestine and other soy based compounds and they were looking into it and they said well
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:52.920]  actually it does look like in animal studies there's an inhibition of the ebola virus to some
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:57.880]  degree also in combination with various drugs which can be used with natural substances to
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.680]  reduce side effects or reduce actual dosage and they were saying no it looks really promising it
[02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:10.440]  looks powerful yet the funding completely stopped so as for selenium as for all the other possibilities
[02:27:10.440 --> 02:27:15.080]  as for the other natural compounds it's all out there the research is out there it is real
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:19.640]  they're just not funding it because they're just sitting around waiting for bill gates
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:23.800]  and melinda gates to offer the latest vaccine they're not telling you about preparedness
[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:27.480]  so you know jay i want to ask you first before we get into the next thing on this what are you
[02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:34.120]  doing to prepare yourself right now i have a i mean right now i have uh you know a little
[02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:38.520]  bit of colloidal silver on hand i have a little bit of selenium on hand um i noticed that the
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:43.640]  silver bullet is sold out right now but um what i'd like to do is actually um i've been looking
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:49.000]  into the bob beck protocol and although getting the equipment for the whole the whole setup is
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:54.600]  going to be kind of an expensive or deal for me i'm looking into blood electrification because
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:00.760]  as i understand it that that uh process can actually uh it interacts somehow with um with
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:06.120]  the virus in such a way that it can't can't produce enzymes necessary to invade hostels well
[02:28:06.120 --> 02:28:10.760]  you know overall there is natural research out there that there are ways to potentially uh
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:17.160]  you know inhibit this but obviously you know the key thing here is maybe we shouldn't let people from
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:22.360]  Liberia who are coughing get on a plane and would be a stall that would that would be a start it's
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:27.160]  a sad day for me even into natural health which i've been into for a very long time and doing the
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:30.920]  research and looking at it to have to even talk about how to prepare ourselves but that's where
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:35.240]  we are now that's where we are they're just letting people in with Ebola and it should come as no
[02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.640]  surprise that we're going to have in a ball outbreak in the united states should come as no
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:43.960]  surprise to anyone it should come as no surprise that you need to prepare yourself i mean it should
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:50.360]  come as no surprise me living in reality i live in reality i don't sit here all day and and you
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.240]  know and and think about every theory about how the world's going to end none of us do we try to
[02:28:55.240 --> 02:29:01.320]  live our lives warn people alter the course of humanity and and for the better but we also have
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:05.720]  preparedness aspects you know storeable food is something that i'm always going to have some of
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:11.800]  or iodine every single time we get a new supply x2 which we're running out of right now every
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:17.080]  single time i grab a box for myself and ultimately it ends up getting stolen by friends and family
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:22.040]  who need it themselves so i have to replenish it constantly but i know what i need and i know the
[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:26.760]  preparedness aspects of it selenium look into it i know that i have my storeable food i have my
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:31.320]  iodine i have my colloidal silver and that's for my preparedness pack look into it do your own
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:34.680]  research but overall you need to defend yourself because the government's not going to do it for
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:39.800]  it more of your calls coming up after the break we're going to have david night in studio to cover

[02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:40.520]  cover just a couple of stories here one out of zero hedge will the fed let the stock market crash
[02:33:40.520 --> 02:33:45.480]  before an election this is charles hugh smith anyone in their position with the tools at hand
[02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:49.400]  would not have any of the real option other than to buy stocks in whatever quantity is needed to
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:54.440]  reverse the selling and blow the shorts out the water so there's a speculation that the fed could
[02:33:54.440 --> 02:34:00.120]  be preparing to intervene in the stock market before the election either to cause a crash or
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:06.360]  to prevent one we've had a lot of negative stock news over the past recent weeks what would happen
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:12.680]  to incumbents in the election a few weeks from now if the stock market crashes the happy story
[02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:17.160]  that all is well and you would be wise to reelect the incumbents responsible for the economic good
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:22.200]  news would be reduced to rubble so they're speculating that this could be part of the october
[02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:27.400]  surprise that many people have talked about an economic panic right before the election
[02:34:28.200 --> 02:34:33.720]  which could really shake up the the midterms there so that's an interesting article out of
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:40.200]  zero hedge a potential october surprise in the economy also from zero hedge today china claims
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:45.240]  us behind hong kong protests a commentary in the official newspaper of the chinese communist party
[02:34:45.240 --> 02:34:50.440]  on saturday accused the us of trying to foment a color revolution in hong kong so we've already
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:56.520]  had claims that foreigners are behind these protests in hong kong we've had evidence that
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:35:01.640]  the national endowment for democracy as it was involved in ukraine and many other color revolutions
[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:07.560]  is active again in hong kong but now for the first time chinese state media has directly
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:14.200]  blamed the united states for fermenting that uprising as a color revolution to destabilize
[02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:21.240]  beijing just as they attempted to do of course and succeeded in Kiev overthrowing the legitimately
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:27.080]  elected government and replacing it with an EU vassal puppet state so we're continuing to watch
[02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:32.040]  developments in hong kong david night your comments on that and also the the new story
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:37.480]  out of the washington post probe of contract for illegal silences leads to web of pentagon secrets
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:41.640]  yeah you know you're talking about manipulating the stock market making comments look good it's
[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:46.360]  kind of interesting to me living in this country that it seems like every four years when they're
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:50.680]  if there's an incumbent president who's running for reelection we can usually see a drop in gas
[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:55.320]  prizes right now i think there's a lot of incumbents especially in the democrat party
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:59.640]  that are very concerned about uh they're getting reelected i think it's interesting we're seeing
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:03.880]  yet again another drop in gas prices even though you've got a lot of unrest in the middle east
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:09.880]  which you would think would perhaps drive that up maybe that's just a coincidence but um this story
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:14.920]  that is uh up on drudge right now to the washington post it's a real interesting little bit of
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:21.960]  intrigue that kind of surfaced from one particular case and it is mushrooming to shed some light on
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.600]  this secretive organization within the pentagon and they're saying that a criminal investigation
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:31.800]  has exposed a secret weapons program intertwined with allegations of a sweetheart contract fake
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:38.840]  badges and trails of destroyed evidence now what this is is a group of about 10 civilian employees
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.800]  most of them retired military personnel and something that is known as the directorate
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:49.720]  for plans policy oversight and integration a directorate this kind of sounds like something
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:56.120]  out of a communist country doesn't it but what they did was they ordered 349 silencers and they paid
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:02.680]  a hot rod auto mechanic in california $1.6 million to make these silencers now his cost
[02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:08.760]  in parts is only about $10,000 so that's a pretty good profit margin the crux of it they say is
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.640]  whether or not these silencers were properly purchased for an authorized secret mission
[02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:19.080]  or were they part of a rogue operation and they've got a former senior navy official speaking out
[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:24.440]  on it he says i know it sounds goofy but it was like they were building their own many law enforcement
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:29.240]  and intelligence agency we've seen that before haven't we i mean everything in this government
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:34.840]  when everything is secret that the government does and it's not just black ops but i mean it
[02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:39.080]  doesn't matter who you try to talk to from our perspective and government pretty much everybody
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:43.720]  throws up a shield there's no transparency no candor anywhere when the everything the government
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.520]  does is secret and everything that you do is an open book to them that is a recipe for
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:53.480]  disasters a recipe really for tyranny they started destroying evidence and one of the things that they
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:38:02.120]  came across was a stash of ak-47s uh 1600 of them now of course ak-47s are russian weapons
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:07.160]  they're not used by the u.s military and as the washington post points out if the foreign made
[02:38:07.160 --> 02:38:13.000]  weapons were equipped with unmarked silencers the weapons could have been used by us or foreign
[02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.880]  forces or special ops in other country in other countries without any risk that they would be
[02:38:17.880 --> 02:38:23.400]  traced back to united states in other words for a false flag for a false flag or to arm the syrian
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.920]  rebels or even other entities of course we know out of Benghazi weapons flowed that was hidden for
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:33.960]  a long time it was later confirmed that weapons were being sent out of Benghazi to so-called
[02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:39.240]  moderate rebels in syria so they they have to hide these programs behind this this veil of
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.360]  secrecy and obviously this could be another example of that and it was just last august that we had
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:50.280]  this report on info wars dot com is august 16th uh again they were percolating the situation in
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:59.800]  syria the u.s army bought 600 000 ak-47 magazines uh fully loaded the u.s army doesn't have any ak-47s
[02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:05.480]  officially okay so who are they giving it to what rebel groups are they secretly arming with that
[02:39:05.480 --> 02:39:09.640]  and of course we know that there's been a lot of arming and training of rebel groups within syria
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:15.160]  because that's the next state on their list that's what all this isa stuff is about is an excuse to
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:20.920]  get into the country one way the other and start a war then they can go after the syrian government
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:25.720]  itself and the pretense of fighting the rebels that they actually created and armed and trained
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.640]  let's go to a colonel martin in tennessee you're in the air go ahead martin
[02:39:29.640 --> 02:39:39.800]  uh yes sir i just uh wanted to let you know that uh my opinion is that the cdc is nothing
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:49.480]  more than a supposed hybridized pseudo government entity we should not expect anything from them
[02:39:49.480 --> 02:39:54.760]  they are much like the federal reserve they're part of the agenda we should protect ourselves
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:39:59.480]  okay thanks for the call we're going to go to steve in arizona who says he's a fight
[02:39:59.480 --> 02:40:03.480]  apartment worker regarding Ebola training steve you're on the air go ahead
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:06.600]  do we have steve
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:13.480]  steve's not there maybe we can get back to steve we'll go to kerr in oregon kerr you're on the air go
[02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:23.720]  ahead hi gentlemen uh this is great um i have a statement and a question um about encryption i'm a
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:31.640]  25 year it professional and uh my thought is that whether it's bitcoin or email or voting machines
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:40.280]  there is no trustworthy code open source and not just transparent and not just the algorithms
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:47.000]  transparent but um a plan to systematically review that because what we found with the open ssl
[02:40:48.040 --> 02:40:55.560]  virus was that it is open source and nobody ever actually peer reviewed it and uh my question is
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:04.760]  really where do we go from here uh i have a lot of powerful progressive friends and they're all in
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:10.760]  their own world and could care less about the things that we talked about here on info wars and
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:16.360]  i believe the only war is the info war and we lose anything if we lose the constitution we lose
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:21.240]  everything i don't think we win the aftermath of this well i mean we saw earlier we covered the story
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:27.240]  about msnbc which of course is a is a liberal stronghold record low viewing ratings you know we
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:32.600]  get what three million listeners a day just on the radio show alone so they are waking up they are
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.960]  coming over to outside and it's part of that process of losing faith in the mainstream media which
[02:41:37.960 --> 02:41:44.200]  we've seen uh definitely over the past 10 years so we have to judge it by that benchmark um david
[02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:49.160]  night the point about encryption i mean we had we had william binion recently he said that people
[02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:54.120]  who use encryption which i do for my email they're the ones who get targeted but still it is a good
[02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:59.400]  protection a good at least surface level of protection against uh invasive spying yeah that's
[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:04.360]  true i mean one of the things pgp was one of the first encryption programs came out for emails
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:09.480]  by phil simmerman like 20 years ago and the big problem was if you're the only one doing the
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:13.400]  encryption then you get the special uh attention and they've got all the time in the world to
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:17.960]  decrypt it you know you can decrypt some of the people some of the time but you can't decrypt
[02:42:17.960 --> 02:42:23.880]  everybody all the time but in terms of apathy i think that's the greater issue i think the apathy
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:28.440]  is a greater issue and on this article that was linked on the drudge report today from tech crunch
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.760]  where they're talking about the interview with ed snowden where he said get rid of drop box avoid
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:37.000]  facebook avoid google what i thought was the most interesting thing out of that article
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:42.120]  was the caption here where he says he talks about why you should be concerned about privacy
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:45.800]  and this is what you need to tell your friends if they're conservative or liberal and they just
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:51.560]  don't understand why this matters he said when you say i have nothing to hide you're saying i don't
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:57.240]  care about this right you're saying i don't have this right because i got to the point where i have
[02:42:57.240 --> 02:43:02.920]  to justify it the way rights work is the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights and
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:06.280]  so that's one of the things that you really need to understand and then the other thing that he said
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:11.160]  in the article is he says we don't need to know every technical detail of what's going on in every
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:16.440]  program of the intelligence community but we do need to know the bare and broad outlines of the
[02:43:16.440 --> 02:43:21.720]  powers our government is claiming they have and how they affect us and how they affect our relationships
[02:43:21.720 --> 02:43:29.240]  overseas because if we don't we're no longer citizens we no longer have leaders we are subjects
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:35.000]  and we have rulers i would say we are slaves at that point i'd put a much stronger point on it but
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.200]  very eloquent that's from ed snowden if you want to know why it matters i think those are a couple
[02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:45.080]  of very good quotes to talk to your friends about it does matter to have a right to privacy
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:49.800]  however i think i am very skeptical that there's anything out there that technologically protects
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.120]  us i think we need to stand together primarily we need to let them know that we're not going to
[02:43:54.120 --> 02:43:59.560]  stand for this we need to insist that we have law enforcement leaders who will lock up people in the
[02:43:59.560 --> 02:44:04.440]  government if they break the law in terms of privacy just like they would if they were robbing
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:09.960]  banks i would expect the fbi director to lock up police officers if they were robbing people on
[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:14.760]  the streets i would expect him to lock up people within the federal government who are robbing
[02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:20.040]  us of our rights and when he says distrust the government but he doesn't do his job to lock up
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:26.520]  people who have violated the laws who are criminals he's not doing anything to make us have any
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:31.800]  confidence in this he's just part of the problem in my opinion and for people who say you know they
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:35.800]  don't care about their privacy it's a complete misnomer because as soon as you say okay well
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:41.000]  give me your email password give me access to your bank account then this they suddenly have real
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:46.040]  concerns about privacy it's only with the government you can trust the government apparently to violate
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:51.240]  your privacy but not even your closest friends can be trusted with your email password so again
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.480]  it's a cop out and they need to understand that government has always been the main threat
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:45:00.840]  specifically with surveillance now even eric schmidt is warning that it's so invasive in terms of the
[02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:05.320]  internet that it could undermine the entire structure of the internet and break the worldwide
[02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:11.320]  web so you know i'd like to see the trendies you don't really care about privacy um cope without
[02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:16.360]  the internet i think they would begin to really care if that was a genuine threat which many people
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:23.320]  are now saying it could well be kyle in illinois you're on the air go ahead kyle yeah hi uh this is
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:31.720]  carlin illinois go ahead what's your point today okay uh regarding this ebola fiasco that's happening
[02:45:31.720 --> 02:45:39.000]  here in our country um someone may have brought this question up before i'm not sure but it's on my
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:48.280]  mind uh if a mosquito bites an ebola infected person and then goes on to sting someone else
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:55.400]  can mosquitoes and flies carry this disease forward that's my question i mean this is a
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:02.760]  major concern because this is mosquito season and most of america does have mosquitoes and flies
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.480]  that bite you they they take your blood and they can also deposit germs into a human body
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.960]  well we don't know you know we don't know if it's a vector born that way of course there was a lot
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:17.640]  of fear about that with hiv people were concerned that hiv could be transferred by mosquitoes because
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:23.000]  it was blood-borne that turned out to not happen they're saying they haven't noticed any situation
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.720]  where this has been transferred but you know when we look at these cases even with the western
[02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:32.280]  doctors and nurses who go over there they're telling us i i really don't know how i got it
[02:46:32.280 --> 02:46:36.680]  and so that's what the concern is did they get it because it was airborne did they get it because
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:41.080]  of the aerosols did they get it because they touched something that someone else touched and
[02:46:41.080 --> 02:46:47.080]  there hadn't been enough time passed for the virus to die on the outside quite frankly we really
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:53.400]  don't know that's why i believe that we ought to exercise additional care that those countries that
[02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:58.360]  are suffering from the epidemic should be sealed off not that we need to seal our borders as much
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:02.840]  as we need to seal that in because they can go to intermediate countries and then come in that way
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.160]  that there's many ways that they can do it and believe me if it starts to affect five to 15
[02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:11.560]  percent of the population as the cdc is currently projecting it well in those countries they will
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:16.040]  find a way to get out if there's any way to get out they're going to want to get out of that
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:21.480]  situation anybody would and of course there were reports and i think these were confirmed that you
[02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:26.840]  know bats are a real delicacy over there in west africa people were eating these bats catching a
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:31.720]  bowler that way if the bats were not properly cooked so that was one way in which it was spreading
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:37.160]  regarding mosquitoes i don't think that's been confirmed bob in connecticut go ahead you're on
[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:43.480]  the air bob yeah i want to say hi paul how you doing and david uh i just wanted to make an observation
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.880]  on our government's response to this the ball it's been totally inadequate uh the cdc is complicit
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:58.520]  in it uh the Ebola is airborne and the do d you know has known that since 1989 and i think this is
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:04.920]  just a war against the the people of the united states otherwise they would have closed down the
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:11.240]  air travel from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria what do you guys think about that well yeah there
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:15.960]  was the 1989 experiment i believe it was in Virginia that was the case isn't it where they
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:20.280]  proved that it was airborne to at least a limited extent they said they believed that it was at least
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:24.200]  with aerosols they wound up having to execute those monkeys because they couldn't stop it
[02:48:24.920 --> 02:48:30.680]  yeah and there was also the 2012 study in canada so i look at this paul and and and this article
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:36.840]  comes out today from Reuters the us needs to rethink Ebola infection control says the cdc chief
[02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:43.560]  they need a new strategy he says and i would ask what strategy i haven't seen or heard of any strategy
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.560]  when they make mistakes like the very first press conference that they had with the governor
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:53.560]  and local health officials they didn't have an explanation as to how come this lady uh was not
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:57.960]  treated right away why they had not disinfected the apartment so many things that we didn't even
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:04.040]  know at that time that they hadn't done they didn't make any uh confession about what they had done
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:07.720]  and say this is where we screwed up and this is how we're going to keep that from happening again
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:12.920]  there is no strategy to contain this they don't have any treatment for it the only thing that
[02:49:12.920 --> 02:49:19.000]  appears to show some promise that has availability is the uh convalescent serum and they're not doing
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.160]  anything to create a donor registry or test the blood there they're not going to have any of these
[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:27.400]  experimental vaccines for quite some time they don't have a strategy for treatment or containment
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:35.720]  brad in louisiana you're in the air go ahead brad hi david paul the strategy is if it's not broke
[02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:40.760]  don't fix it and the fact of the matter that it nothing has happened over the past few decades
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:50.120]  to reach this magnitude nothing has been done to upgrade the protocols and the various mechanisms
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:56.040]  by which things are handled so it's become a situation of not what you know but who you know
[02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:03.400]  my real question is um the response to our governor bobby jindal who is a man's man a god
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:11.560]  fairing man who loves his state about banning all flights into louisiana was answered quickly by uh
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:19.400]  the government of what i considered to be not the united states but the cooperating states uh has
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:28.120]  made has issued some edict whereby we are to dispose of the remains of these people what do
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:35.240]  you know about it and why is no one talking about these guillotines any longer thank you for your
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:40.040]  time well of course we had the story on friday about the uh the femur coffin liners that was

[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:13.080]  david night there's no talk of blocking the flights out of west africa due to Ebola
[02:55:13.080 --> 02:55:19.000]  yet in 2011 and you can see this in the Forbes article tsa threatens to cancel all flights out
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.560]  of texas if groping bill passed they basically threatened an embargo a blockade on texas if
[02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:31.560]  this bill passed which banned tsa groping they were quite prepared to block all flights coming in
[02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:39.240]  and out of texas over tsa goons touching your junk and intercepting those deadly snow globes
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:44.600]  yet we have an Ebola threat imminent and nothing's being done this is ridiculous
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:49.400]  yeah absolutely and at the time this was happening we subsequently learned from this lawsuit that
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:55.480]  john corbett has going with the tsa they published on pacer dot gov an unredacted version later they
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:56:00.200]  put the redacted version up and what they were saying is at exactly the same time in internal
[02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:06.120]  documents the tsa was saying there is no threat of terrorists against airports or airplanes yet
[02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:11.640]  they were going to turn texas into a no fly zone because it was about controlling people they don't
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:16.040]  want to control the disease they want to control people talking about it relevance i mean we got
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:20.520]  the pentagon now unveiling a plan for dealing with climate change i mean they've got a climate
[02:56:20.520 --> 02:56:26.040]  change adaptation roadmap i mean whenever the problem whether it's an Ebola outbreak in africa
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:30.440]  or whether it's presumed climate change they always want to use the military it's like you
[02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:34.120]  know when you only think you got as a hammer everything looks like a nail and they're just
[02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:40.120]  not effective in these other areas but that's not a real threat anyway there's not any global warming
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:46.200]  going on and they haven't tied it to co2 the co2 levels have gone up the temperatures have not gone
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:53.400]  up the real hockey stick is the number of people who are getting Ebola in the african nations and
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.240]  they're completely ignoring that while they're spinning around playing with climate change and
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.840]  making no fly zones out of the ts to support the tsa steve in arizona final call you're on the
[02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:10.120]  eye go ahead make it quick hi i'm a firefighter from arizona and um i just want to point out
[02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:15.480]  something real quick it's distressing i haven't received any training formally from my department
[02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:20.760]  i don't fault them for it uh i i kind of fault the as the government for it because of the
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:24.680]  erroneous information that's being disseminated for example the president saying that you cannot
[02:57:24.680 --> 02:57:33.240]  catch Ebola uh riding on a bus from with home and however notice uh noticing that the uh the cbc
[02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:39.080]  classified Ebola as a bio safety level four each agent which requires a fully encapsulated suit
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:45.240]  to deal with it's very distressing and there are only four of those biosecurity facilities in the
[02:57:45.240 --> 02:57:49.640]  entire united states david night and you're not alone it's it's not just firefighters and first
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:54.200]  responders 85 percent of nurses this is a story up on info wars dot com right now from kit daniels
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:59.960]  85 percent of nurses are not trained for Ebola 76 percent of nurses also say the hospital that they
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:05.640]  work at has no policy for admitting Ebola patients and yet we're told by the politicians don't worry
[02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:10.440]  everything's under control they haven't done a thing it's just blustering bluffing and a lot
[02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:14.840]  of nurses have been protesting that they've not received that training either that's right it's
[02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.960]  amazing we'll continue to track it um a lot of breaking Ebola news going up today of course we
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:26.920]  have the second patient in dallas uh back on sunday concerns out of europe again that more
[02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:32.200]  Ebola cases could be arriving in the uk as well we'll continue to track it on info wars dot com
