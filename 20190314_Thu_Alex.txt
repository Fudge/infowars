[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  it
[00:15.520 --> 00:19.800]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[00:19.800 --> 00:28.440]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars dot-com studios. It's Alex Jones
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.720]  We all live it is the 14th of March
[00:38.040 --> 00:42.000]  2019 and Alex Jones will be in place for the third hour
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.560]  Time being we're talking about Beto may yeah, of course. He's enough
[00:46.560 --> 00:52.800]  Hey, we're gonna have to put up with Beto and his skateboard for the next 18 months at least the absolute horror of that
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.000]  Beto has come out. He's now stopped. He came out in an interview last night
[00:57.640 --> 00:59.640]  He's it now. It's official and
[01:00.480 --> 01:08.200]  He's trying to move away from the center already. We have this civil war within the democratic party of the
[01:08.360 --> 01:12.040]  stream left-wing fringe versus the moderate center
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.000]  There was a big debate about whether the center would move left later on down the line
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.740]  Well, Beto's already moving left moving to the fringe moving to the extreme. He's talking about the planet ending
[01:24.080 --> 01:27.960]  12 years time just like AOC did a couple of weeks ago
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.000]  Where doom that's a war all starts presidential campaign by claiming the world faces
[01:34.000 --> 01:42.200]  Astrophy wants hundreds of millions of climate refugees will overwhelm board as humanity could go extinct in less big planet in
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.800]  12 years, so he's already going over the top with this hope top rhetoric
[01:48.480 --> 01:51.640]  Again moving to the left fringe of the Democratic Party
[01:52.120 --> 01:58.920]  That gives you a sense of how it's going to be in the next year 18 months going forward. Also talking about Brexit
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.340]  Donald Trump has just been out and said you have to be prepared to walk away from a bad deal
[02:04.560 --> 02:10.480]  This exact quote the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal seem desperate to make it
[02:10.920 --> 02:17.000]  That makes the other guys fell blood and you're dead Theresa May are you listening?
[02:17.600 --> 02:21.480]  Basically have a situation if you pay now by the country. It's no longer
[02:22.120 --> 02:28.040]  Democratic now they're gonna vote on delaying Brexit yet again last night. They voted on
[02:28.040 --> 02:31.160]  Cutting out eliminate no deal altogether
[02:32.160 --> 02:34.360]  Nigel Farage's that
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.120]  Parliament note the represents the people
[02:37.800 --> 02:45.000]  We have the Queen waiting in think when will the Queen be activated basically we have a dictatorship of
[02:45.800 --> 02:52.960]  MPs in Parliament have overridden the trade that they've ignored the will 17 point four million people
[02:52.960 --> 02:57.840]  She needs to step up to the plate to protect democracy
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.240]  Party reports no delay from EU or we like seven free Nigel Farage
[03:03.880 --> 03:10.080]  European Parliament that is the situation if this Brexit deal gets delayed past the end of May
[03:10.080 --> 03:18.240]  We're gonna have European elections gonna have a flood of MEs stand for Brexit for democracy for the British people
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.400]  And against the EU super state hope we talk about that as well
[03:23.040 --> 03:29.040]  Tucker Carlson main protect from the George Soros funded media matters outfit now
[03:29.040 --> 03:31.040]  He's hit back by thinking out that
[03:31.600 --> 03:40.240]  Angelo Prasone one of the main architects of peace against him said probably way worse than he did so we're gonna play
[03:41.600 --> 03:43.400]  Also talking about
[03:43.400 --> 03:50.400]  Facebook and Instagram suffering the most severe outages ever. This is the problem with the novel power of
[03:51.320 --> 03:52.320]  Facebook
[03:52.320 --> 03:53.400]  Instagram
[03:53.400 --> 04:00.720]  Oculus what that all go down at the same time in one case Facebook down for 14 hours break
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.320]  No explanation how to why are all these different platform on the same back?
[04:07.320 --> 04:15.080]  Is the weakness of monopolies? This is why these big tech corporations need to be with you and fight for us laws
[04:15.960 --> 04:22.840]  Stephen Colbert in an in Tulsi gathered who is one of the democratic contenders who actually took any sense and is reasonable
[04:23.640 --> 04:26.160]  Basically, he's now fully frowns way behind
[04:26.360 --> 04:31.420]  War past behind the state after having his teeth on going after George
[04:31.420 --> 04:37.300]  Butch or being a warm-up a steeply if lived meanwhile in Europe
[04:37.980 --> 04:45.180]  You have Germany deliberately ignoring and concealing migrant crimes while avoid stirring up prejudice
[04:45.780 --> 04:49.140]  highlighted this issue or perhaps they're actually now
[04:50.180 --> 04:56.860]  Concealing covering up crimes committed by migrants to prevent some kind of civil unrest in Germany
[04:56.860 --> 05:01.740]  So we're gonna talk about and a whole post more on the Alex Jones show today
[05:02.060 --> 05:07.940]  Also, Norwegian writer slams dishonest media for hiding got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners
[05:07.940 --> 05:12.140]  This was gonna be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore for a year and a half
[05:12.140 --> 05:16.140]  Fight, but we have the original producer the original crystal source the best
[05:16.660 --> 05:22.980]  Atomic Ida in the world x2 is back. Got it. This deal just happened about a month ago. We rush it into production
[05:22.980 --> 05:27.620]  It's been bottled the labels are being put on today, and then it's gonna be on an 18-wheeler

[05:38.300 --> 05:40.500]  Celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching
[05:41.100 --> 05:46.660]  Research the iodine conspiracy find out why it's so important find out what the globalists don't want you to have
[05:47.020 --> 05:50.620]  The good halogen what you have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com
[05:50.620 --> 05:56.900]  That's the umbrella site in force life.com if you write the supplements, and this is the king daddy
[05:57.660 --> 06:03.260]  Ladies and gentlemen it is x2 original now back at infowarstore.com
[06:03.260 --> 06:33.220]  We're live and we're talking about better announcing that he will run a
[06:33.380 --> 06:39.380]  No surprise at this point obviously he came out in a TV interview last night and basically all but said that now
[06:39.380 --> 06:48.380]  It's being confirmed right bar reports left mox bettos messiah-esque born to run remarks peak white male privilege
[06:48.860 --> 06:54.580]  Now they're already eating their own. This is absolutely hilarious and this goes to the point if
[06:55.300 --> 06:59.220]  Betto is gonna have to spend half of his time up on the debate platform
[06:59.220 --> 07:08.780]  Excusing himself for being a white male for having white male privilege and denying the presidency to a woman or to a minority
[07:09.700 --> 07:11.700]  How's he gonna win that race?
[07:11.700 --> 07:15.780]  How's he gonna get through that field of women of minorities?
[07:16.460 --> 07:21.820]  With them already feasting upon him for the crime of being a white male
[07:21.820 --> 07:28.860]  Left-wing activists and liberal journalists were quick to mock former rep Robert Francis Betto awoke on Wednesday evening
[07:29.340 --> 07:33.300]  After he told vanity fair that he was born to run for president
[07:33.700 --> 07:37.980]  He told vanity fair quote. You can probably tell I want to run. I do. I think I'd be good at it
[07:38.500 --> 07:43.540]  I'm just born to be in it and want to do everything I humanly can for this country at the moment
[07:43.980 --> 07:48.780]  But hours after they published that forming story awoke confirmed to KTSM in Texas
[07:48.780 --> 07:54.100]  He would announce on Thursday that he is running for president. That's now happened for his critics
[07:54.940 --> 07:58.180]  immediately played the identity politics card
[07:59.460 --> 08:02.900]  Alex Segura on Twitter at some verified liberal or other
[08:04.020 --> 08:11.940]  Said quote. I'm just born to be in it is peak white male privilege and I say this as someone who general generally likes Betto
[08:12.780 --> 08:17.100]  The car he sellers said vote Betto. He was born to do it. That's weird as hell
[08:17.100 --> 08:21.740]  Jennifer Granholm says not sure this vanity fair piece will help Betto's campaign
[08:22.060 --> 08:25.780]  so he's coming across as overbearing as overprivileged and
[08:26.780 --> 08:31.220]  He's a white male. How is he going to come back from being a white male again?
[08:31.220 --> 08:38.380]  The whole debate around this democratic field is at what point will the center will the moderates will the likes of Betto and
[08:38.740 --> 08:46.500]  Biden be forced to move left with the overton window as the overton window has shifted left in terms of the democratic party
[08:46.500 --> 08:52.180]  becoming more extreme more left-wing more socialist more progressive and
[08:52.900 --> 08:57.820]  That question's pretty much been answered straight away. This is the headline out of the Daily Mail
[08:58.380 --> 09:03.380]  Where doomed better oil rock starts presidential campaign by claiming the world faces catastrophe
[09:03.580 --> 09:06.860]  More than hundreds of millions of climate refugees will overwhelm borders
[09:07.380 --> 09:11.260]  Humanity could go extinct unless we fix the planet in 12 years
[09:11.260 --> 09:19.380]  So he's jumped on board immediately with the doomsday rhetoric of Alexandria, Acadio Cortez and others already
[09:19.980 --> 09:25.020]  In a video in which he warned his first presidential campaign that parts of the planet will soon become
[09:25.620 --> 09:33.020]  uninhabitable driving a massive wave of climate refugees across the border if America's government doesn't adopt emergency measures within the next 12 years
[09:33.740 --> 09:35.740]  now this is a bizarre
[09:35.900 --> 09:37.420]  statement because
[09:37.420 --> 09:39.420]  he talks about quote
[09:39.420 --> 09:42.940]  300,000 immigrants and asylum seekers apprehended on the southern border
[09:43.860 --> 09:51.500]  Being a problem, but then he goes on to say I don't necessarily think that it is. Oh, but by the way if you don't pass this green deal
[09:51.660 --> 09:53.140]  this
[09:53.140 --> 09:56.940]  industry stripping jobs killing ridiculous absurd
[09:58.060 --> 10:01.460]  Parts is an hysterical package of measures that AOC introduced
[10:02.300 --> 10:08.900]  But this kind of migration this is a quote that the kind of migration and refugee flows that we will see from entire bands of this world
[10:08.900 --> 10:12.620]  Are no longer habitable will be a crisis of a different magnitude all together
[10:13.140 --> 10:17.660]  So he's saying that 300,000 immigrants on the border isn't a problem
[10:17.660 --> 10:24.620]  But then he's saying oh it will become a problem when there are millions more because we don't pass this green deal
[10:24.820 --> 10:31.460]  So he's already shifting left in a bid to capture this fringe extremist progressive mantra
[10:31.660 --> 10:36.980]  That will come to characterize the campaign of you know people like Bernie Sanders
[10:36.980 --> 10:39.300]  But then Slate makes the point that
[10:39.940 --> 10:47.380]  Beto or Rourke would enter the race as a man without clear political ideology. He's got no signature legislative achievement
[10:47.380 --> 10:51.940]  I think the the only achievement he's got so far is naming a courthouse
[10:53.380 --> 10:58.500]  The slate goes article goes on to say he has no major policy issue or a concrete agenda for the country
[10:58.740 --> 11:04.900]  Those in the know tell the Atlantic that Beto is planning to run as a candidate quote offering hope that America can be better
[11:04.900 --> 11:10.660]  Can be better than its current partisan and hate build politics that the country can come together
[11:11.460 --> 11:17.660]  So he's trying to keep two plates spinning in the air at the same time on the one hand with this rhetoric already
[11:17.660 --> 11:19.780]  He's moving left and on the other hand
[11:19.780 --> 11:23.580]  He's trying to move away from that kind of unhinged hysteria
[11:23.780 --> 11:30.660]  The hate Trump resistance movement that will come to characterize most of the other Democratic candidates in that field
[11:30.820 --> 11:33.500]  By actually trying to have a unifying message
[11:33.500 --> 11:41.100]  That's not going to go across well on the debate stage when these others are tearing into him because he's not going to go anti-Trump
[11:41.100 --> 11:44.860]  He's not going to go far enough with his anti-Trump rhetoric
[11:45.660 --> 11:52.300]  But then again, this is why even many in the mainstream media and on the left. There was the USA today headline today
[11:53.260 --> 11:58.300]  Democrats civil war between progressives and moderates mean Trump will win in 2020
[11:58.700 --> 12:00.700]  So they're going to rip each other apart
[12:00.700 --> 12:06.460]  Either they're too far left-wing or they're not anti-Trump enough and that's going to basically
[12:07.100 --> 12:13.100]  Make them rip chunks out of each other during the campaign and that is only going to benefit Donald Trump
[12:14.540 --> 12:21.020]  Meanwhile, Rosie O'Donnell says Biden is too old to run. She's not the only liberal saying no to Joe
[12:22.380 --> 12:27.580]  What nobody's talking about and it's mentioned in some of these articles in this me too era
[12:27.580 --> 12:32.780]  Is the documented problem that creepy uncle Joe has with women and
[12:33.820 --> 12:35.820]  Let's face it children
[12:36.220 --> 12:42.860]  Most of these articles mention his behavior around women, which is notorious. In fact, we had a secret service source
[12:42.860 --> 12:47.580]  I did an article about this last year. I believe it was that said it was basically impossible
[12:48.060 --> 12:54.260]  To bring wives and girlfriends to the White House for events with Joe Biden because he couldn't keep his hands off them
[12:54.260 --> 12:58.260]  Now they're admitting in some of these articles, but it's buried down the bottom
[12:58.980 --> 13:00.980]  Joe Biden's behavior around women
[13:01.860 --> 13:03.860]  And his behavior around young girls
[13:04.500 --> 13:07.060]  If he runs and that's almost certain at this point
[13:07.700 --> 13:11.860]  Will become the Hillary's health of 2020
[13:13.300 --> 13:15.300]  That will be Joe Biden's
[13:15.380 --> 13:19.460]  Um platform that he's going to fight against just as Hillary's health was was the
[13:19.460 --> 13:25.700]  Uh narrative that she had to fight against and it blew up in her face. Obviously she ended up collapsing on many occasions
[13:26.340 --> 13:30.900]  They don't realize how big this scandal is going to be when more information comes out about it
[13:31.380 --> 13:36.500]  And when this really takes hold in the public eye in the political narrative going forward
[13:36.900 --> 13:41.060]  The only thing they're saying about Joe Biden right now the thing that's prominent is that he's too old
[13:42.100 --> 13:45.860]  Now trump was 70 at the time of his inauguration
[13:45.860 --> 13:49.300]  Joe Biden if he won would be 78
[13:50.340 --> 13:54.180]  So even by the end of his first term he would be 82 years old
[13:54.980 --> 13:57.380]  Rosie O'Donnell has come out and said he's too old
[13:57.380 --> 14:00.260]  So they're already trying to throw Joe Biden under a boss. Remember
[14:00.820 --> 14:05.940]  What was it last week? He had to he had to come out and apologize for calling Mike Pence a nice guy
[14:06.500 --> 14:08.500]  That's how unhinged the left is
[14:08.980 --> 14:14.420]  So any kind of reasonable rhetoric they tamp down on it in a hurry
[14:14.420 --> 14:16.420]  Now they're saying that he's too young
[14:17.220 --> 14:20.980]  Uh, Rosie O'Donnell's come out. She's not the only celebrity expressing concern
[14:21.540 --> 14:27.220]  Ken Owl and the executive producer of this is us said in a tweet last week the wild biden's charisma is infectious
[14:27.700 --> 14:29.700]  He comes across as authentic
[14:29.860 --> 14:31.860]  But he's too old
[14:31.860 --> 14:34.900]  He's not the same man. He was 10 years ago Owl and tweeted
[14:35.460 --> 14:40.740]  So they're trying to attack him on his age and they're trying to attack him on the fact that god forbid he said
[14:40.740 --> 14:44.580]  Mike Pence was a nice guy, but the article continues
[14:45.940 --> 14:48.500]  This is Rosie O'Donnell says Biden is too old to run
[14:49.060 --> 14:50.740]  In the me too era
[14:50.740 --> 14:57.940]  Biden is also likely to face criticism for his handling of the sexual harassment allegations leveled against supreme court justice clowns thomas
[14:58.900 --> 15:01.780]  by Anita hill during the thomas 91 confirmation
[15:02.420 --> 15:08.580]  Last year, biden was who was the chairman of house judiciary committee during those hearings said he wished he could have done more to protect hill
[15:08.580 --> 15:11.460]  If he said got victimized again during the process
[15:12.180 --> 15:15.940]  So even as they acknowledge that biden's got problems
[15:16.340 --> 15:21.780]  From an optics standpoint in the me too era. They completely fail to mention the fact
[15:23.140 --> 15:29.300]  The videos are out there. I did one called creepy uncle joe. It's got I think he's got like 1.3 million views at this point
[15:29.780 --> 15:34.180]  Those videos are only going to recirculate again and again and again
[15:34.180 --> 15:38.900]  Biden is currently the frontrunner, but again, that's mainly because of his name recognition
[15:39.380 --> 15:41.780]  Bernie Sanders is in a second position
[15:42.340 --> 15:44.340]  Again because of name recognition
[15:44.580 --> 15:50.180]  Those two are going to be torn down the more extreme fringe candidates are going to be pushed to the floor
[15:50.980 --> 15:52.980]  And bait betto is going to be
[15:53.380 --> 15:58.580]  Stuck in the middle with nowhere really to go. We're going to get into that and more on the other side of the break
[15:58.580 --> 16:02.660]  This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars.com. We'll be back

[20:07.940 --> 20:10.580]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[20:10.580 --> 20:38.740]  So we have this amazing civil war within the democratic party, which has gotten so
[20:38.740 --> 20:44.660]  But none of the candidates have even been able to admit or acknowledge that they're
[20:44.660 --> 20:45.660]  capitalist.
[20:45.660 --> 20:51.100]  In fact, CNN did a good job for a change that Broken Clock is right twice a day, putting
[20:51.100 --> 20:56.540]  together this montage of democratic candidates, which we'll play in a second, absolutely
[20:56.540 --> 21:00.120]  terrified of admitting that they're capitalist again.
[21:00.120 --> 21:07.220]  It shows how far left the Democratic Party has moved that they're so beset with terror
[21:07.220 --> 21:12.900]  at being called out for being capitalist that they didn't even say it when asked directly.
[21:12.900 --> 21:19.100]  Nancy Pelosi came out in the past hour and said she can't basically name a single accomplishment
[21:19.100 --> 21:23.580]  that Beto O'Rourke had had while he was in the House of Representatives.
[21:23.580 --> 21:27.060]  I think he got one courthouse named and that was about it.
[21:27.060 --> 21:32.900]  And then President Trump came out in the past hour as well, headline, Trump mocks Beto
[21:32.900 --> 21:36.820]  O'Rourke's hand movements, is he crazy or is that the way he acts?
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.860]  So Trump's already way ahead of the curve here.
[21:39.860 --> 21:45.820]  You remember that throughout the 2016 campaign, he identified characteristics from each of
[21:45.820 --> 21:49.300]  his opponents and absolutely railed them on it.
[21:49.300 --> 21:55.020]  You know, lying Ted, low energy Jeb Bush, stuck that target on their back and throughout
[21:55.020 --> 22:00.260]  the whole of their campaign, they were obviously perturbed by it, trying to shift away from
[22:00.260 --> 22:02.060]  being framed in such a way.
[22:02.060 --> 22:07.020]  Now he's done the same for Beto O'Rourke by invoking O'Rourke's hand gestures and apparently
[22:07.020 --> 22:10.180]  questioning his mental condition.
[22:10.180 --> 22:14.860]  This was in the Oval Office about an hour ago, Trump said, quote, he has a lot of hand movement.
[22:14.860 --> 22:17.540]  Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?
[22:17.540 --> 22:18.980]  I've never seen hand movement.
[22:18.980 --> 22:22.860]  I watched him a little while this morning doing, I seem some kind of news conference.
[22:22.860 --> 22:26.100]  I've actually never seen anything quite like it study it.
[22:26.100 --> 22:28.100]  I'm sure you'll agree.
[22:28.100 --> 22:35.180]  So now Beto O'Rourke is going to be hyper-conscious about his hand movements for the next 18 months
[22:35.180 --> 22:39.580]  if he successfully makes his way through this democratic field without getting knocked
[22:39.580 --> 22:40.860]  out early.
[22:40.860 --> 22:43.780]  And Trump has painted that characteristic on him.
[22:43.780 --> 22:47.900]  Now he's always going to be hyper-aware of his hand movements and that's going to put
[22:47.900 --> 22:48.900]  him off, isn't it?
[22:48.900 --> 22:54.500]  Trump is an expert at doing this kind of thing, at giving people nicknames and ascribing them
[22:54.500 --> 23:00.700]  certain negative or shifty behaviors, certainly Creepy Uncle Joe is going to make a comeback
[23:00.700 --> 23:06.260]  if he announces his run, but now Trump is calling out Beto O'Rourke for his crazy hand
[23:06.260 --> 23:07.260]  movements.
[23:07.260 --> 23:12.900]  That is not only interesting in terms of ascribing him some kind of characteristic to put him
[23:12.900 --> 23:16.980]  off, but also again questioning Beto's sanity.
[23:16.980 --> 23:23.460]  And I mentioned just a second ago, all the democratic candidates are absolutely terrified
[23:23.460 --> 23:25.540]  about admitting to being capitalists.
[23:25.540 --> 23:33.460]  At least Beto O'Rourke has the balls to do so, he told CNBC, quote, I'm a capitalist,
[23:33.460 --> 23:36.580]  I don't see how we're able to meet any of the fundamental challenges that we have as
[23:36.580 --> 23:40.540]  a country without in part harnessing the power of the market.
[23:40.540 --> 23:46.300]  That's the same can't be said for the other democratic candidates who have failed to announce
[23:46.300 --> 23:52.700]  that they're capitalists again in absolute blind panic about being savaged by the left-wing
[23:52.700 --> 23:56.140]  fringe of the democratic candidacy field.
[23:56.140 --> 24:01.500]  We have a CNN clip on that subject, clip seven right now, here it is.
[24:01.500 --> 24:06.980]  So why does the question, are you a capitalist, have so many people running for the exits?
[24:06.980 --> 24:10.700]  John Ablon has our answer in our reality check, hi John.
[24:10.700 --> 24:13.940]  You know what shouldn't be a tough question for someone running for president?
[24:13.940 --> 24:14.940]  It's this.
[24:14.940 --> 24:15.940]  Are you a capitalist?
[24:15.940 --> 24:19.820]  It's a layup, basic stuff rooted in American history and culture.
[24:19.820 --> 24:23.540]  And yet, democratic candidates seem to get in a spot around the axle on this one.
[24:23.540 --> 24:27.180]  And in the process, only helping Donald Trump's re-election.
[24:27.180 --> 24:31.780]  Exhibit A's John Hickenlooper, entrepreneur who bounced back from a layup to a pioneering
[24:31.780 --> 24:36.660]  brew pub, going on to become mayor of Denver and eventually two-term governor of Colorado.
[24:36.660 --> 24:41.500]  And yet, when Joe Scarborough gave him three chances to answer the question, he whiffed
[24:41.500 --> 24:42.500]  three times.
[24:42.500 --> 24:48.700]  When you call yourself a proud capitalist, oh I don't know, you know again the labels
[24:48.700 --> 24:53.820]  I'm not sure any of them fit, you consider yourself a capitalist.
[24:53.820 --> 24:59.020]  Well again, the labels, you know I have a small business person, do you consider yourself
[24:59.020 --> 25:01.860]  a capitalist and does capitalism work?
[25:01.860 --> 25:07.380]  Well I think, I don't look at myself with a label.
[25:07.380 --> 25:12.700]  Look, I co-founded a group called No Labels a while ago, but that's ridiculous.
[25:12.700 --> 25:16.660]  Hickenlooper seemed afraid of angering Bernie bros and social media mobs, but the man was
[25:16.660 --> 25:18.540]  a centrist democratic governor.
[25:18.540 --> 25:22.300]  He helped flip a red state blue, it's the basis of his campaign, and it's nothing to
[25:22.300 --> 25:23.300]  apologize for.
[25:23.300 --> 25:25.380]  But Hickenlooper's not the only one.
[25:25.380 --> 25:27.220]  So what about capitalism?
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.220]  Are you a capitalist?
[25:28.220 --> 25:32.780]  See, here's the thing with all these labels and as you said, how they're used to define
[25:32.780 --> 25:34.860]  people and where they're coming from.
[25:34.860 --> 25:40.540]  But as you see, so many of these labels are misused, misunderstood to the point where
[25:40.540 --> 25:45.460]  people don't have any idea what they even mean anymore.
[25:45.460 --> 25:49.860]  Many tells you Gabbard may have a point there, according to Gallup, only 17% of Americans
[25:49.860 --> 25:53.820]  define socialism correctly, the government ownership of the means of production.
[25:53.820 --> 25:56.940]  That's half the number who could define it properly at the start of the Cold War.
[25:56.940 --> 26:02.820]  And get this, today 6% of Americans believe socialism means being social and getting
[26:02.820 --> 26:03.820]  along with people.
[26:03.820 --> 26:06.780]  About a quarter can't say what it means at all.
[26:06.780 --> 26:10.900]  But Americans know what capitalism is, after America's basically been a liberal capitalist
[26:10.900 --> 26:12.860]  democracy since our founding.
[26:12.860 --> 26:16.780]  We've had presidents who expanded the social safety net and others who expanded free markets.
[26:16.780 --> 26:20.820]  But it all exists within the framework of capitalism and for all its flaws, it's been
[26:20.820 --> 26:27.020]  far more successful at expanding freedom and prosperity than any of the alternatives.
[26:27.020 --> 26:31.980]  They have, again, democratic candidates failing to acknowledge that they're capitalists in
[26:31.980 --> 26:36.740]  absolute abject terror that they get called out by the left wing of their own party.
[26:36.740 --> 26:42.620]  Another issue that's going to crop up during these primaries is the huge problem of opioid
[26:42.620 --> 26:43.620]  addiction in America.
[26:43.620 --> 26:47.060]  You have a headline here out of CNBC.
[26:47.060 --> 26:52.260]  This chart shows there could be a real link between opioid use and people not working.
[26:52.260 --> 26:56.860]  Again, we have Trump announcing during the State of the Union that he wants the largest
[26:56.860 --> 27:01.740]  number of legal immigrants ever to take American jobs.
[27:01.740 --> 27:06.020]  Much of his base was up in arms about that and rightly so.
[27:06.020 --> 27:09.740]  Many of the people who are out of work in America, there's a massive overlap with those
[27:09.740 --> 27:14.060]  who are basically hooked on opioids.
[27:14.060 --> 27:17.340]  Article reads, the US opioid crisis is hitting the country on many fronts, including the
[27:17.340 --> 27:19.300]  labor market.
[27:19.300 --> 27:23.660]  States that prescribe more opioids for 100 people tend to have fewer people in their
[27:23.660 --> 27:25.380]  labor force.
[27:25.380 --> 27:29.620]  West Virginia, a state with one of the highest opioid prescription rates in the country in
[27:29.620 --> 27:35.980]  2015, had the lowest labor force participation rate in 2018 at 54%.
[27:35.980 --> 27:42.260]  Alabama, the state with the highest prescription rate, has a participation rate of 57%, which
[27:42.260 --> 27:45.900]  is also one of the lowest.
[27:45.900 --> 27:50.700]  They found a direct correlation between people hooked on opioids and not being in the labor
[27:50.700 --> 27:51.700]  force.
[27:51.700 --> 27:53.100]  Will anyone address this issue?
[27:53.100 --> 27:59.300]  I know that Andrew Yang, who is running as a Democrat, basically on small donations,
[27:59.300 --> 28:03.540]  he's got no real chance of getting on the big debate stage because he's not part of
[28:03.540 --> 28:08.380]  the Democratic Party establishment, is bringing up this issue time and time again and rightly
[28:08.380 --> 28:09.380]  so.
[28:09.380 --> 28:14.500]  Trump covered it at the start of his presidential term in office, but he hasn't really spoken
[28:14.500 --> 28:17.060]  about it much since.
[28:17.060 --> 28:23.060]  Article continues, in turn states like Minnesota and Colorado have two of the highest labor
[28:23.060 --> 28:28.860]  force participation rates, along with low opioid prescription levels.
[28:28.860 --> 28:33.740]  Overdose related deaths have skyrocketed in recent years, between 1999 and 2017 those
[28:33.740 --> 28:39.380]  deaths rose sixfold according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[28:39.380 --> 28:43.820]  In my video, The Collapse of Western Civilization, which I'm going to play later in the show,
[28:43.820 --> 28:47.660]  I document again, it's not just prescription drugs, you can basically look at any drug
[28:47.660 --> 28:52.620]  including heroin abuse, MDMA, marijuana.
[28:52.620 --> 28:56.620]  People are more hooked than ever, and people are more depressed than ever, and again that
[28:56.620 --> 29:01.180]  has a direct correlation to the jobs market, we'll be back on the Alex Germshaw Live Infowars
[29:01.180 --> 29:04.180]  dot com.
[29:04.180 --> 29:08.140]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize

[30:30.300 --> 30:32.100]  original X2.
[30:32.100 --> 30:36.060]  I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago, we
[30:36.060 --> 30:40.940]  now have X2 again and in Full War Store.com, so hallelujah, it's been sold out for about

[32:05.020 --> 32:08.940]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:08.940 --> 32:13.460]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[32:13.460 --> 32:18.900]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:18.900 --> 32:24.260]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:24.260 --> 32:25.820]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:25.820 --> 32:32.340]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:32.340 --> 32:36.340]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:36.340 --> 32:37.820]  in the rainwater.
[32:37.820 --> 32:43.060]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[32:43.060 --> 32:49.140]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:49.140 --> 32:54.740]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:54.740 --> 33:00.100]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[33:00.100 --> 33:08.140]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:08.140 --> 33:19.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:19.860 --> 33:24.860]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[33:24.860 --> 33:28.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:28.580 --> 33:32.620]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[33:32.620 --> 33:38.020]  We are live in Alex Jones' room here in a third hour.
[33:38.020 --> 33:42.620]  We're going to go back to some more news and talk about Tucker Carlson here in this segment.
[33:42.620 --> 33:49.260]  But first, I want to direct you to infowarsstore.com, where for a limited time only, infowars
[33:49.260 --> 33:53.340]  selects storeable food products are available at up to 50% off.
[33:53.340 --> 33:56.060]  This is another huge discount.
[33:56.060 --> 34:00.020]  For a limited time only, we're giving you up to 50% off on our infowars selects storeable
[34:00.020 --> 34:02.660]  food line at infowarsstore.com.
[34:02.660 --> 34:07.060]  With all of the uncertainty in the world, it's never been so important to be prepared
[34:07.060 --> 34:09.420]  for a food emergency or empty shelves.
[34:09.420 --> 34:15.580]  Of course, FEMA, all these different government agencies routinely stockpile food for emergencies,
[34:15.580 --> 34:17.580]  so why shouldn't you?
[34:17.580 --> 34:23.700]  All of these infowars selects storeable foods have a shelf life of 25 years and are made
[34:23.700 --> 34:26.660]  with super high quality ingredients in the USA.
[34:26.660 --> 34:33.220]  You compare these prices to storeable food in the EU or in the UK, absolutely no competition.
[34:33.220 --> 34:38.220]  The prices are so ridiculously good that you could save this for 20 odd years and then
[34:38.220 --> 34:44.300]  just eat it if nothing happens and save an absolute ton of money on groceries and on
[34:44.300 --> 34:45.780]  food.
[34:45.780 --> 34:49.580]  We don't know what's coming, but we can always start preparing for tomorrow.
[34:49.580 --> 34:57.340]  50% off infowars selects storeable food now available at infowarsstore.com, where we also
[34:57.340 --> 35:02.580]  have bodies, the ultimate turmeric formula at 50% off.

[35:30.580 --> 35:31.580]  to reorder.
[35:31.580 --> 35:39.100]  Of course, there are studies related to turmeric and the properties within it that have to
[35:39.100 --> 35:40.620]  do with elevated mood.
[35:40.620 --> 35:45.100]  We don't make claims for that, but if you research the background of turmeric, again,
[35:45.100 --> 35:50.220]  a lot of studies relating to mood elevation, we sell it on the basis of joint support,
[35:50.220 --> 35:51.220]  mobility support.
[35:51.220 --> 35:55.900]  It's filled with powerful ingredients, including five different herbs and extracts.
[35:55.900 --> 36:00.740]  With these ingredients, bodies is a true 360 win that can help you again with all those
[36:00.740 --> 36:03.020]  joint support, mobility support issues.
[36:03.020 --> 36:09.900]  It's available, it's back in stock, 50% off, just $29.95 for a 60-day supply available
[36:09.900 --> 36:14.380]  right now at infowarsstore.com.
[36:14.380 --> 36:19.140]  Now I want to talk about Tucker Carlson because they're routinely trying to drag him down,
[36:19.140 --> 36:23.660]  to bring him down, because he is the most powerful voice on the right.
[36:23.660 --> 36:28.900]  They're absolutely incensed that he's held that primetime Fox News slot, that he still
[36:28.900 --> 36:33.180]  beats the likes of Rachel Maddow night after night after night.
[36:33.180 --> 36:34.700]  He is their ultimate target.
[36:34.700 --> 36:38.500]  I'm talking about media matters, I'm talking about George Soros, I'm talking about Sleep
[36:38.500 --> 36:41.420]  and Giants, all these advertiser boycotts.
[36:41.420 --> 36:47.380]  And basically, they dug up some 10 to 15-year-old jokes that he'd made on a radio show and
[36:47.380 --> 36:51.420]  they're trying to create a fake controversy about it, trying to pretend that they're all
[36:51.420 --> 36:53.300]  outraged and offended.
[36:53.300 --> 36:57.660]  And of course, their primary and only goal is to get him kicked off the air.
[36:57.660 --> 37:02.940]  They don't care, they're not really outraged or offended, and they've said much worse.
[37:02.940 --> 37:08.660]  In fact, the very guy leading this witch hunt against Tucker Carlson, media matters president
[37:08.660 --> 37:16.020]  Angelo Carassone, wrote block posts about, quote, Japs, Jewery and Trannies.
[37:16.020 --> 37:21.260]  Nobody's calling for a boycott of him, nobody's calling for a boycott of media matters.
[37:21.260 --> 37:24.260]  This is what he wrote.
[37:24.260 --> 37:27.340]  Carassone and media matters, this is from the Daily Caller article, which openly pined
[37:27.340 --> 37:32.540]  for the destruction of Fox News, have justified the left-wing boycott campaign by pointing
[37:32.540 --> 37:39.060]  to a number of statements that Carlson made on a radio shock jock show between 2006 and
[37:39.060 --> 37:40.060]  2011.
[37:40.060 --> 37:44.620]  So we're talking eight to 15 years ago, I did a tweet on this yesterday, retweet if
[37:44.620 --> 37:51.060]  you can give less of a damn about what Tucker Carlson joked about 10 years ago, got something
[37:51.060 --> 37:53.060]  like 10,000 retweets.
[37:53.060 --> 37:58.220]  But if we're playing the game of who can be offended more, Carassone has his own track
[37:58.220 --> 38:03.340]  record of inflammatory statements, his now defunct blog included degrading references
[38:03.340 --> 38:07.220]  to Trannies, Jewery and Bangladeshis.
[38:07.220 --> 38:13.180]  He posted a one-lengthly diatribe in November 2005 about a Bangladeshi man who was robbed
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.340]  by a gang of transvestites, as Carassone described it.
[38:17.340 --> 38:22.020]  He was offended that the gang was described as attractive in the article, and it goes
[38:22.020 --> 38:23.020]  on and on.
[38:23.020 --> 38:26.380]  We can't even read out some of this stuff on air, it's that ridiculous.
[38:26.380 --> 38:30.140]  But again, I don't care what he wrote 10 years ago on his blog, but if they want to
[38:30.140 --> 38:32.700]  play that game, then we can play that game.
[38:32.700 --> 38:35.420]  We can talk about James Gunn.
[38:35.420 --> 38:42.260]  Let's now go to the Tucker Carlson clip from last night on his show in which he defended
[38:42.260 --> 38:47.420]  this Media Matters latest attack against him and called out the Media Matters founder for
[38:47.420 --> 38:49.340]  behavior that was far worse.
[38:49.340 --> 38:51.740]  This is clip A, let's roll it.
[38:51.740 --> 38:56.700]  That's when Hayes invited a man called Angelo Carassone onto his show.
[38:56.700 --> 38:58.620]  Carassone runs Media Matters.
[38:58.620 --> 39:04.460]  Almost every day he issues outraged press releases accusing other people of bigotry.
[39:04.460 --> 39:11.300]  And yet, because everything is irony, Carassone is himself an enthusiastic bigot.
[39:11.300 --> 39:15.260]  We know this for sure because he has written about it extensively.
[39:15.260 --> 39:19.620]  It turns out that for years Carassone maintained a racist blog.
[39:19.620 --> 39:24.660]  One post entitled, quote, Traini Paradise addressed a crime story from Thailand.
[39:24.660 --> 39:29.180]  A Bangladeshi man had been robbed and assaulted by a group of male prostitutes dressed as
[39:29.180 --> 39:30.180]  women.
[39:30.180 --> 39:34.780]  Carassone objected to the idea that this was even a story and ridiculed South Asians
[39:34.780 --> 39:40.860]  as inherently ugly and poor, quote, is the writer a Traini lover too?
[39:40.860 --> 39:44.980]  Or perhaps he's just trying to justify how these Trainis tricked this Bangladeshi in
[39:44.980 --> 39:45.980]  the first place.
[39:45.980 --> 39:48.900]  Look, man, we don't need to know whether or not they were attractive.
[39:48.900 --> 39:51.340]  The effing guy was Bangladeshi.
[39:51.340 --> 39:54.300]  What the hell was he doing with $7,300 worth of stuff?
[39:54.300 --> 39:58.140]  The guy's Bangladeshi, end quote.
[39:58.140 --> 40:02.780]  In another post, Carassone described how a male coach at a Japanese high school had
[40:02.780 --> 40:04.900]  sexually abused female players.
[40:04.900 --> 40:08.220]  People in Japan were horrified by this, understandably.
[40:08.220 --> 40:09.220]  Carassone was not.
[40:09.220 --> 40:12.940]  His advice, quote, lighten up, japs.
[40:12.940 --> 40:18.220]  Later that month, Carassone, by now in a frenzy of racism, heaped praise on a former Ku Klux
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.220]  Klan leader.
[40:19.220 --> 40:24.740]  In still another post from the same period, Carassone described a Jewish man as being
[40:24.740 --> 40:29.020]  handsome, quote, despite his jewelry.
[40:29.020 --> 40:33.060]  Carassone didn't like the man's political views, but attributed them to, quote, his
[40:33.060 --> 40:40.220]  possession of several bags of Jewish gold, end quote, Jewish gold.
[40:40.220 --> 40:44.660]  According to Angela Carassone, Jewish gold is a problem.
[40:44.660 --> 40:47.500]  Media Matters probably ought to issue a press release about this.
[40:47.500 --> 40:50.580]  They've done a lot more for a lot less.
[40:50.580 --> 40:54.220]  And yet somehow, and this is the remarkable part, Chris Hayes managed to pretend that
[40:54.220 --> 40:56.020]  none of this ever happened.
[40:56.020 --> 40:59.380]  Hayes never mentioned the Jewish gold.
[40:59.380 --> 41:04.140]  He never said a word about the japs, or the trannies, or the clan, or even those dirty
[41:04.140 --> 41:08.780]  Bangladeshis who deserve what they get, no matter what the tranny lovers say.
[41:08.780 --> 41:09.780]  None of that.
[41:09.780 --> 41:13.820]  Instead, Hayes gave cover to Carassone's bigotry and anti-Semitism.
[41:13.820 --> 41:18.180]  Amazingly, he even directed his viewers to Carassone's website.
[41:18.180 --> 41:22.820]  Angela, of course, all that can be found at Media Matters' website, so you can listen
[41:22.820 --> 41:24.820]  to the full clip, get the full context.
[41:24.820 --> 41:25.820]  Right.
[41:25.820 --> 41:26.820]  Pretty amazing.
[41:26.820 --> 41:34.220]  If a guy with a history of ranting about Jewish gold came on your show, would you ask
[41:34.220 --> 41:35.220]  him about it?
[41:35.220 --> 41:36.720]  Would you challenge him on it?
[41:36.720 --> 41:37.720]  How could you not?
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.020]  You'd feel morally obligated, but Chris Hayes didn't.
[41:41.020 --> 41:42.020]  That tells you a lot.
[41:42.020 --> 41:47.580]  Now, to be clear, we're not calling for either of these people to be imprisoned, or executed,
[41:47.580 --> 41:49.780]  or even fired from their high-paying jobs.
[41:49.780 --> 41:53.580]  We're not planning to organize an advertiser boycott against them.
[41:53.580 --> 41:56.100]  We won't pick at their offices with bullhorns.
[41:56.100 --> 41:58.500]  We won't attack their children.
[41:58.500 --> 42:00.740]  But we do think you should know what they're actually like.
[42:00.740 --> 42:03.820]  And in Chris Hayes' case, it's kind of depressing to find out.
[42:03.820 --> 42:08.700]  It turns out you really never know who people are.
[42:08.700 --> 42:13.140]  So there's Tucker Carlson defending himself against the latest witch organized by Media
[42:13.140 --> 42:17.660]  Matters, the George Soros-funded outfit Media Matters, which they continually deny, even
[42:17.660 --> 42:19.660]  though it was literally in the New York Times.
[42:19.660 --> 42:23.140]  George Soros gives $1 million to Media Matters.
[42:23.140 --> 42:28.500]  Now this Angelo Karasongi, also you have the narrative on the left, which is the right
[42:28.500 --> 42:31.380]  hates journalists and wants to physically attack journalists.
[42:31.380 --> 42:37.220]  Well, that's kind of embarrassing for him, because in a tweet, he tweeted at two Breitbart
[42:37.220 --> 42:42.500]  reporters and said, quote, he was plenty strong enough to kick your butt if you mouthed off
[42:42.500 --> 42:46.700]  like that in person instead of from the comfort of Randy's armpit.
[42:46.700 --> 42:52.020]  So this guy, Angelo Karasongi, is on Twitter, physically threatening journalists while the
[42:52.020 --> 42:56.380]  left-wing media has this big narrative about the right-wing hating journalists.
[42:56.380 --> 42:58.580]  Was he, was he's verified tick taken away?
[42:58.580 --> 42:59.580]  Was he suspended by Twitter?
[42:59.580 --> 43:00.580]  No, nothing happened.
[43:00.580 --> 43:04.020]  We'll be back to talk about it more on the next show, show live info was dull.
[43:04.020 --> 43:08.380]  The worst part about getting old and I'm still strong 45 is that I won't be there for my
[43:08.380 --> 43:09.380]  children someday.
[43:09.380 --> 43:11.100]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[43:11.100 --> 43:12.860]  Now I can be there for my children.
[43:12.860 --> 43:14.700]  Now I can make them strong.
[43:14.700 --> 43:16.340]  Now I can instruct them.
[43:16.340 --> 43:18.940]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[43:18.940 --> 43:22.100]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're even better
[43:22.100 --> 43:24.300]  getting rid of what you said they were before.
[43:24.300 --> 43:28.980]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book
[43:28.980 --> 43:29.980]  burning, isn't it?
[43:29.980 --> 43:33.380]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[43:33.380 --> 43:37.660]  I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people
[43:37.660 --> 43:42.460]  know the truth and you can't be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something
[43:42.460 --> 43:45.380]  and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[43:45.380 --> 43:50.140]  There is a magic that then takes place, the transcend space and time when you commit the
[43:50.140 --> 43:53.700]  award of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[43:53.700 --> 43:56.740]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[43:56.740 --> 44:01.300]  So please now commit to support info wars however you can and realize your provision
[44:01.300 --> 44:04.460]  to info wars is your own provision.
[44:04.460 --> 44:09.340]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[44:09.340 --> 44:13.820]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all
[44:13.820 --> 44:18.860]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.

[46:15.580 --> 46:17.500]  leave you more tired than ever.

[46:33.180 --> 46:38.620]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water and enjoy.

[46:43.020 --> 46:46.820]  up on whenever you need a boost.
[46:46.820 --> 46:49.740]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home.
[46:49.740 --> 46:53.140]  Turboforce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[46:53.140 --> 46:55.020]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[46:55.020 --> 47:24.980]  Her cup with turboforce at infowarstore.com.
[47:24.980 --> 47:35.620]  So the head honcho at Media Matters, the guy who led the witch-hunk campaign against Tucker
[47:35.620 --> 47:41.260]  Carlson, is the same guy who wrote things far worse than anything Tucker Carlson ever
[47:41.260 --> 47:50.420]  joked about when he talked about Japs, Jews and Trannies, also in a tweet threatened physical
[47:50.420 --> 47:55.060]  violence against other journalists because they disagreed with him.
[47:55.060 --> 48:00.020]  Now we have this headline out of Newsweek, Tucker Carlson could face hate speech charges
[48:00.020 --> 48:02.820]  if he were Canadian or British.
[48:02.820 --> 48:07.980]  So basically, in other words, if we were in crappy countries like Canada and Britain where
[48:07.980 --> 48:14.660]  no First Amendment exists, we could lock up our political enemies.
[48:14.660 --> 48:18.660]  That's basically what they're saying here, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson has faced
[48:18.660 --> 48:24.000]  growing calls to resign after racist and sexist comments he made 15 years ago, which no one
[48:24.000 --> 48:25.500]  cares about.
[48:25.500 --> 48:33.060]  On a radio show several years ago, and they asked a lawyer, David Butt, about what would
[48:33.060 --> 48:38.980]  happen to Tucker Carlson if he had said these things in Canada or the United Kingdom.
[48:38.980 --> 48:43.380]  He said that these remarks could constitute hate speech, which under the country's criminal
[48:43.380 --> 48:46.580]  code can be considered a chargeable offence.
[48:46.580 --> 48:50.860]  Why are they even writing this news article, Tucker Carlson is American, the statements
[48:50.860 --> 48:54.860]  he made were said in America, they were broadcast in America.
[48:54.860 --> 49:00.100]  This entire article is basically, oh, if only we didn't have a First Amendment like Canada
[49:00.100 --> 49:04.700]  doesn't or like the United Kingdom doesn't, then we could lock him up.
[49:04.700 --> 49:11.420]  The absolute authoritarianism implicit in this article is beyond belief.
[49:11.420 --> 49:16.100]  This lawyer continues, could these conversations in terms of their content qualify as hate
[49:16.100 --> 49:19.380]  speech under Canadian legislation, again, who cares?
[49:19.380 --> 49:20.380]  It's not in Canada.
[49:20.380 --> 49:25.220]  He didn't say it in Canada, wasn't broadcast in Canada, yes, they could.
[49:25.220 --> 49:28.500]  On their face, it's not difficult to see that when you're calling somebody pigs and
[49:28.500 --> 49:31.140]  whores as a class, that's hateful.
[49:31.140 --> 49:38.020]  So they literally want to turn insults into hate speech, and have you locked up for insults,
[49:38.020 --> 49:43.420]  not even targeting their precious protected groups of people in some cases, just targeting
[49:43.420 --> 49:48.180]  your political enemies, which is kind of ironic, because then you have the guy leading
[49:48.180 --> 49:53.220]  the charge against Tucker Carlson, literally doing that and threatening physical violence
[49:53.220 --> 49:55.060]  against other journalists.
[49:55.060 --> 49:57.620]  Let's go to this Caitlin Bennett report now.
[49:57.620 --> 50:02.860]  How the left wants to ban Tucker Carlson and why it's a bigger issue than just media matters.
[50:02.860 --> 50:03.860]  Here it is.
[50:03.860 --> 50:14.900]  The left-wing mob is at it again, and their target this time, Tucker Carlson.
[50:14.900 --> 50:19.060]  The Democratic Psycho fans have set their eyes on a new target that they hope to turn into
[50:19.060 --> 50:25.940]  another Alex Jones, and they won't stop until he is completely taken off the air and de-platformed.
[50:25.940 --> 50:30.300]  For months now, the left has religiously preyed on his every word in hopes of stirring up
[50:30.300 --> 50:31.940]  outrage amongst their mob.
[50:31.940 --> 50:37.740]  And unfortunately, they've been quite successful in doing so.
[50:37.740 --> 50:42.740]  Tucker has become such a target for the left for one reason, and one reason only, because
[50:42.740 --> 50:47.940]  he is an unapologetic Trump supporter, and he supports President Trump's immigration
[50:47.940 --> 50:48.940]  policies.
[50:48.940 --> 50:54.260]  Since the left has been unsuccessful in taking down Trump, they see taking down his supporters
[50:54.260 --> 50:56.260]  as the next best thing.
[50:56.260 --> 51:01.100]  This is why they've become hostile towards anyone with a MAGA hat, and have gone as far
[51:01.100 --> 51:06.180]  as making run-of-the-mill conservatives feel unwelcome and unsafe in public.
[51:06.180 --> 51:11.980]  So to the left, since the number one rated cable news host is a Trump supporter, they
[51:11.980 --> 51:14.940]  have to do everything to try to take him out.
[51:14.940 --> 51:20.020]  According to TheRap.com, Carlson's audience this year is not only larger than his direct
[51:20.020 --> 51:25.540]  competitions, it is larger than anything in the 8 p.m. hour on all of cable.
[51:25.540 --> 51:32.060]  And yes, that includes ESPN, HDTV, and everything else.
[51:32.060 --> 51:36.380]  Letting a Trump supporter become the most watched name in news is totally unacceptable
[51:36.380 --> 51:37.380]  to the left.
[51:37.380 --> 51:42.300]  So their goal now is to make sure he is left with no audience to spread the president's
[51:42.300 --> 51:43.300]  message.
[51:43.300 --> 51:44.300]  Intermedia matters.
[51:44.300 --> 51:49.260]  The trustworthy, Soros-funded, fake news outlet that exists for the sole purpose of
[51:49.260 --> 51:50.260]  defaming conservatives.
[51:50.260 --> 51:56.180]  The sad little communist rag orchestrated a calculated attack against Carlson this week
[51:56.180 --> 52:00.140]  that has led to another full-flesh ambush on the Fox News host.
[52:00.140 --> 52:05.180]  Keep in mind that this is the same exact outlet that lied about me saying I put infowars on
[52:05.180 --> 52:10.860]  computers in an Apple store because of quote, Apple's racism against life.
[52:10.860 --> 52:15.700]  I explicitly said I did this because of their censorship of Alex Jones.
[52:15.700 --> 52:20.060]  Watch this video, and you tell me if you think there's any credibility to media matters
[52:20.060 --> 52:21.060]  accusation.
[52:21.060 --> 52:27.060]  So I heard that Apple banned Alex Jones and infowars from their iTunes store.
[52:27.060 --> 52:31.060]  We just wanted to leave them with a little gift.
[52:31.060 --> 52:47.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the most important broadcast I've ever done in my life.
[52:47.860 --> 52:53.340]  So now that we've established what kind of credibility this outlet has, none, we can
[52:53.340 --> 52:56.340]  understand what their intentions are with Tucker.
[52:56.340 --> 53:01.060]  Someone from the website combed through 13 years worth of content from Tucker Carlson
[53:01.060 --> 53:07.380]  to unearth a comment he made in 2006 when he called into someone else's radio show.
[53:07.380 --> 53:13.700]  Going through 13 years, 13 years worth of someone's content to dig up something they
[53:13.700 --> 53:16.660]  said is not journalism, it's malicious.
[53:16.660 --> 53:22.220]  There are accusations against him, but he made numerous misogynistic and perverted comments.
[53:22.220 --> 53:25.940]  And oh no, he called prostitutes slutty.
[53:25.940 --> 53:31.540]  Even though media matters get seven times less web traffic than us here at Infowars.com,
[53:31.540 --> 53:37.740]  the left-wing mob didn't care a thing about the credibility of their source or their reputation.
[53:37.740 --> 53:43.100]  They instead saw it as an opportunity to attack a prominent Trump supporter and posture themselves
[53:43.100 --> 53:47.180]  as being morally superior to their right-wing counterparts.
[53:47.180 --> 53:53.380]  When in fact, we know the left has no standards, no credibility, and no moral compass.
[53:53.380 --> 53:58.980]  Their only guidance is that whatever conservative support is bad and whatever the left supports
[53:58.980 --> 53:59.980]  must be good.
[53:59.980 --> 54:05.340]  What's more concerning the media matters hit piece on Carlson is how the left-wing media
[54:05.340 --> 54:09.220]  ate it up and is doing everything they can to ruin his public image.
[54:09.220 --> 54:14.580]  In fact, if you Google Tucker Carlson, you will find no favorable articles and will instead
[54:14.580 --> 54:18.380]  be bombarded with hit piece after hit piece from left-wing outlets.
[54:18.380 --> 54:24.860]  You'll see articles from the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Slate, and Stephen Colbert.
[54:24.860 --> 54:28.660]  In fact, the very first thing that shows up when you search his name is an article from
[54:28.660 --> 54:32.700]  the Washington Post titled, Tucker Carlson Needs To Go.
[54:32.700 --> 54:33.700]  Now.
[54:33.700 --> 54:38.740]  On Twitter, the hashtag FIRE Tucker Carlson was trending for days and hit pieces on him
[54:38.740 --> 54:41.460]  were pushed to the top of everyone's feed.
[54:41.460 --> 54:46.340]  Despite the endless number of conservatives coming to Carlson's defense, strangely only
[54:46.340 --> 54:50.820]  the hit pieces on him are the ones showing up in search engines and on social media.
[54:50.820 --> 54:56.140]  And you would think that since Carlson makes a living by putting his face on a camera and
[54:56.140 --> 55:01.300]  is the most watched television personality, the hit clips on Fox might come up when you
[55:01.300 --> 55:03.460]  search his name on YouTube, right?
[55:03.460 --> 55:04.460]  Wrong.
[55:04.460 --> 55:09.300]  The top search results are instead hits on Tucker from CBS, MSNBC, and CNN.
[55:09.300 --> 55:14.620]  The fact that a video with a mere 511 views is the top result when you search his name
[55:14.620 --> 55:18.740]  is all the proof you need that big tech companies are pushing an agenda.
[55:18.740 --> 55:23.380]  If you've been following outlets like Info Wars and Project Baratoc, this should come
[55:23.380 --> 55:29.060]  as no surprise, since big tech's left-wing bias has been on full display for years now.
[55:29.060 --> 55:33.060]  And Google has been known to skew search results to favor left-wing sources.
[55:33.060 --> 55:38.060]  So now, if you didn't already realize, it is abundantly clear that the media and the
[55:38.060 --> 55:43.060]  big tech firms are evidently working together to try to take down one of President Trump's
[55:43.060 --> 55:45.100]  biggest allies in the media.
[55:45.100 --> 55:50.500]  And they are giving him the exact same treatment that they gave Alex Jones.
[55:50.500 --> 55:55.100]  Luckily for Carlson, conservatives aren't buying it this time and are refusing to give
[55:55.100 --> 55:56.620]  into the left-wing mob.
[55:56.620 --> 56:00.900]  Tucker took to Twitter to say, quote, media matters caught me saying something naughty
[56:00.900 --> 56:03.940]  on a radio show more than a decade ago.
[56:03.940 --> 56:08.380]  Rather than express the usual, witch-rule, contrition, how about this?
[56:08.380 --> 56:11.740]  I'm on television every weeknight live for an hour.
[56:11.740 --> 56:15.140]  If you want to know what I think, you can watch.
[56:15.140 --> 56:19.180]  Anyone who disagrees with my views is welcome to come on and explain why.
[56:19.180 --> 56:23.580]  Tucker knows better than anyone that the left-wing mob has no principles.
[56:23.580 --> 56:27.300]  These are the same people that tried to break into his home and harass his family.
[56:27.300 --> 56:31.660]  Where was the left-wing media to denounce the violence against Carlson?
[56:31.660 --> 56:36.420]  Where were they to stand up for him when the agitators caught his teenage daughter a whore
[56:36.420 --> 56:37.660]  in public?
[56:37.660 --> 56:41.980]  Where were they to defend him from baseless accusations that he assaulted a gay Latino
[56:41.980 --> 56:42.980]  man?
[56:42.980 --> 56:47.180]  Just like every other incident of harassment against a conservative, the left was completely
[56:47.180 --> 56:48.180]  absent.
[56:48.180 --> 56:52.300]  If it weren't for double standards, the left wouldn't have any standards at all.
[56:52.300 --> 56:57.060]  If we don't stand together now against the mob, they will be coming for us next if they
[56:57.060 --> 57:01.780]  will come after innocent teenagers for wearing red hats, they won't hesitate to come after
[57:01.780 --> 57:08.500]  anyone, and they want the biggest name on television to be the first domino to fall.
[57:08.500 --> 57:12.940]  What will happen instead is they will only make Tucker Carlson more popular and make
[57:12.940 --> 57:15.980]  the ever-growing MAGA movement bigger than ever.
[57:15.980 --> 57:20.740]  The media is so scared of seeing Trump get re-elected in 2020 that they have destroyed
[57:20.740 --> 57:25.540]  all of their credibility in the process and instead assured that Trump will win in a huge
[57:25.540 --> 57:27.660]  landslide in 2020.
[57:27.660 --> 57:29.820]  Are you ready to keep America great?
[57:29.820 --> 57:30.820]  I am.
[57:30.820 --> 57:37.100]  There you have it, that's why they want to bring down Tucker Carlson.
[57:37.100 --> 57:42.660]  He refuses to apologize, they want to replace him with some anodyne boring NPC Fox News
[57:42.660 --> 57:43.660]  commentator.
[57:43.660 --> 57:47.060]  Thankfully, Fox News have stood behind him, which is the right decision.
[57:47.060 --> 57:52.540]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Outlook Show Live, Infowars.com, now go away.
[57:52.540 --> 57:57.420]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[57:57.420 --> 58:00.300]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore
[58:00.300 --> 58:04.860]  for a year and a half site, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[58:04.860 --> 58:09.780]  the best atomic iodide in the world, X-2 is back, we got it, this deal just happened

[58:34.700 --> 58:40.660]  don't want you to have the good halogens and what you have the bad halogens at InfowarsStore.com,
[58:40.660 --> 58:44.780]  that's the umbrella site, InfowarsLive.com, makes you write the supplements, and this
[58:44.780 --> 58:55.180]  is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen, it is X-2 original, now back at InfowarsStore.com.
[58:55.180 --> 58:59.060]  Our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd
[58:59.060 --> 59:04.220]  have it during the winter, and that's what I'm talking about at InfowarsStore.com, but

[59:58.740 --> 1:00:09.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:13.140]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[1:00:13.140 --> 1:00:20.540]  It is the Alex Jones show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:00:20.540 --> 1:00:27.860]  We are into the second hour of the Alex Jones show, later on in the next hour, we're going
[1:00:27.860 --> 1:00:33.420]  to play an extremely crucial video called The Collapse of Western Civilization, which
[1:00:33.420 --> 1:00:37.540]  went up last night, which I encourage everyone to share, we'll get to that later in the next
[1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:38.540]  segment.
[1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:43.540]  First, I want to go to this headline, we've had this entire narrative about Trump supporters
[1:00:43.540 --> 1:00:47.860]  are going to attack the media, they're begging for some kind of violent attack on the media,
[1:00:47.860 --> 1:00:49.900]  they will exploit the heck out of that.
[1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:54.860]  Now we have this headline out of Information Liberation, Dems Posh Journalist Protection
[1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:58.420]  Act to make attacking journalists a federal crime.
[1:00:58.420 --> 1:01:03.300]  So they're trying to put journalists in a special category of people, because we don't
[1:01:03.300 --> 1:01:05.940]  exalt them enough already.
[1:01:05.940 --> 1:01:10.620]  So if you violently attack them, and in many senses not even violently attack, that's going
[1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:13.300]  to get you much longer jail time.
[1:01:13.300 --> 1:01:17.700]  It says democratic lawmakers have introduced the bill to make attacking or attempting to
[1:01:17.700 --> 1:01:19.540]  attack a journalist a federal crime.
[1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:25.500]  Now bear in mind that these people on the left think that mean words are violence, they
[1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:30.180]  literally try to recategorize mean words as being violent.
[1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:34.900]  From the Hill, three democratic lawmakers reintroduced the Journalist Protection Act that intends
[1:01:34.900 --> 1:01:38.980]  to designate certain attacks on those reporting the news as a federal crime.
[1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:43.820]  And they're doing it in response to President Trump's climate of extreme hostility.
[1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:50.900]  Bear in mind that Washington Post-CNN is currently facing lawsuits of what, $250 million for
[1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:55.740]  their national demonization campaign of the Covington High School students.
[1:01:55.740 --> 1:02:01.380]  You had CNN literally send reporters to docks old ladies and accuse them of being Russian
[1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:02.380]  bots.
[1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:05.340]  But no, it's Trump supporters who are to blame.
[1:02:05.340 --> 1:02:10.500]  So now they're trying to make this a federal hate crime to attack a journalist.
[1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:15.540]  It says that anyone who intentionally commits or attempts to commit bodily injury to a journalist
[1:02:15.540 --> 1:02:19.780]  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for three to six years.
[1:02:19.780 --> 1:02:24.300]  Again, when it happens the other way, they either ignore it or they support the actual
[1:02:24.300 --> 1:02:25.300]  perpetrator.
[1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:27.980]  We saw Rand Paul violently viciously attacked.
[1:02:27.980 --> 1:02:30.740]  They tried to bury that under the carpet.
[1:02:30.740 --> 1:02:34.460]  So now they're trying to make journalists a special class of people.
[1:02:34.460 --> 1:02:39.780]  So quote, violent attacks against them are punishable by elongated prison sentences.
[1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:45.860]  Again, we just had Newsweek, I read the article before the break, they're talking about, oh,
[1:02:45.860 --> 1:02:50.500]  what a shame it is that we can't push hate speech charges against Tucker Carlson because
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.820]  he's not Canadian or British.
[1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:56.820]  Their definition of hate speech at this point is disagreeing with them.
[1:02:56.820 --> 1:02:59.420]  That's basically what it's come down to.
[1:02:59.420 --> 1:03:04.620]  Meanwhile, Facebook and Instagram suffer most severe outage ever.
[1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:12.300]  Facebook yesterday was down for 14 hours, absolutely pathetic for a major company.
[1:03:12.300 --> 1:03:16.060]  And again, another sign that monopolies are horrible bad news.
[1:03:16.060 --> 1:03:21.260]  They had Oculus, they had Facebook, they had Instagram, they had WhatsApp, all go down
[1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:23.580]  Facebook for 14 hours.
[1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:27.820]  How on earth are they all on the same backbone where if you attack one, they all go down
[1:03:27.820 --> 1:03:29.020]  at the same time.
[1:03:29.020 --> 1:03:32.700]  Again, monopolies, they're only as strong as their weakest link.
[1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:39.380]  BBC News reports, Facebook appears to be recovering from more than 14 hour disruption to all of
[1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:43.500]  its products which left them mostly inaccessible across the world.
[1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:47.420]  They came out and did a tweet at the start of this and denied that it was a denial of
[1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:50.940]  service attack and then basically said nothing about it.
[1:03:50.940 --> 1:03:58.140]  The downtime was double or more their previous longest outage which was back in 2008, that's
[1:03:58.140 --> 1:04:02.980]  when they had under 50 million users, now they've got 2.3 billion users.
[1:04:02.980 --> 1:04:07.780]  How embarrassing was it for Facebook to be down for 14 hours and how much does it tell
[1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:10.780]  us that these monopolies need to be broken up?
[1:04:10.780 --> 1:04:14.820]  Talking about breaking up monopolies, this is a suggestion that I've made before, I made
[1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:17.340]  it again on Twitter yesterday.
[1:04:17.340 --> 1:04:22.740]  Why isn't Trump sending at least one message a day on a competing social media network?
[1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:23.940]  Why is it all on Twitter?
[1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:26.420]  Why is he giving Twitter his content?
[1:04:26.420 --> 1:04:30.620]  Why is he drawing all the attention to Twitter, giving them credibility?
[1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:35.780]  Why does he not just send one message a day on a competing social network that's not controlled
[1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.300]  by Silicon Valley like Paula?
[1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:42.900]  It would force all his haters to sign up, it would force all the media to sign up, it
[1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:47.900]  would force his entire base to sign up, you would not need an executive order and then
[1:04:47.900 --> 1:04:53.300]  that would give that platform credence to be an alternative competing network to networks
[1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:56.140]  like Twitter and Facebook which we haven't had so far.
[1:04:56.140 --> 1:05:00.820]  That needs to be seriously considered, this is the Alex Jones Show Live Infowars.com,
[1:05:00.820 --> 1:05:03.780]  we'll be back.

[1:07:37.180 --> 1:07:40.860]  Now this is the video which I put together over the past few days, it went up live last
[1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:47.620]  night basically talking about how all the precursors to how civilizations collapse, civilizations
[1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:55.300]  on average collapse once every 336 years, well long overdue and many of the preconditions
[1:07:55.300 --> 1:08:00.580]  for the collapse of a civilization as studied by authors and historians and academics have
[1:08:00.580 --> 1:08:07.020]  already been met in the West, this is absolutely chilling, this is the collapse of Western civilization,
[1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:08.460]  here it is.
[1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:13.500]  Civilizations are always the architect of their own downfall, historian Arnold Toynbee
[1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:20.100]  studied 28 different great civilizations and found the same pattern, great civilizations
[1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:27.300]  commit suicide, Ann Glyn Jones spent 9 years studying how civilizations decline, she describes
[1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:32.820]  our culture as one that has quote run its course which is morally, aesthetically and
[1:08:32.820 --> 1:08:39.340]  spiritually bankrupt, is the background home of constant anxiety that pervades our culture
[1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:45.460]  a sign that we know the end is nigh, more Americans than ever are dying from drug overdoses,
[1:08:45.460 --> 1:08:51.540]  gun violence, car crashes or AIDS never killed as many Americans in a single year as overdoses
[1:08:51.540 --> 1:08:58.260]  did in 2017, but the issue isn't just prescription drugs, in the UK so much cocaine is flushed
[1:08:58.260 --> 1:09:04.220]  into the rivers, the endangered eels are becoming hyperactive and not reaching sexual maturity,
[1:09:04.220 --> 1:09:09.820]  the number of 16 to 24 year olds using Coke, Ecstasy, Crystal, Meth and LSD doubled in
[1:09:09.820 --> 1:09:16.780]  just a two year period from 2016 to 2018, in the US heroin abuse has skyrocketed over
[1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:22.060]  the past 15 years, the number of people who used MDMA, marijuana and other drugs also
[1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:29.180]  consistently climbed over the last decade, alcoholism is on the rise, one in eight Americans
[1:09:29.180 --> 1:09:34.460]  is now an alcoholic, and when it comes to taking anti-depressants, white, rural communities
[1:09:34.460 --> 1:09:39.380]  have overtaken African American communities for the first time ever, depression levels
[1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:44.820]  in America are the highest ever measured, suicide rates are higher than ever, despite
[1:09:44.820 --> 1:09:50.340]  all our technology, our entertainment, our consumerism, our chemical enhancements were
[1:09:50.340 --> 1:09:57.820]  more miserable than ever before, our existential dread is more pronounced than ever before,
[1:09:57.820 --> 1:10:04.660]  well intellectual and material ease has manifested civilizational malaise and a lack of transcendent
[1:10:04.660 --> 1:10:10.860]  purpose, the result of this lack of transcendent purpose is self destruction, not merely on
[1:10:10.860 --> 1:10:16.740]  a personal but on a population scale, technical sophistication has been accompanied by mass
[1:10:16.740 --> 1:10:23.180]  incompetence in the art of living, when a society has no purpose to believe in itself
[1:10:23.180 --> 1:10:29.220]  immolates, there's only so far that quasi religious devotion to yoga, Starbucks pumpkin
[1:10:29.220 --> 1:10:34.940]  spiced lattes and Whole Foods kale shakes can go, the latest iPhone can only distract
[1:10:34.940 --> 1:10:40.380]  you from the nagging voice of conscience for so long, endlessly consuming products will
[1:10:40.380 --> 1:10:46.740]  never satiate the soul, we live in the ruins of a civilization that has lost faith in itself,
[1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:52.620]  a civilization that is constantly lectured it must be ashamed of itself and slowly subverted
[1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:57.580]  and destroyed from within as the only form of repentance, and if you're wondering how
[1:10:57.580 --> 1:11:02.620]  we wound up in the dark age we're currently living through, this is how we did, this is
[1:11:02.620 --> 1:11:07.060]  why important science is no longer being conducted, this is why art isn't being made, this is
[1:11:07.060 --> 1:11:11.140]  why comedy is dying, it's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means
[1:11:11.140 --> 1:11:16.900]  the end of creativity, great civilizations collapse when the insatiable greed for sensual
[1:11:16.900 --> 1:11:22.700]  stimulation outweighs the urge for any kind of private or social responsibility, we're
[1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:27.540]  now reaching this point, French author Michel Wellbeck predicted both the rise of Islamism
[1:11:27.540 --> 1:11:32.220]  across Europe and the emergence of the yellow vest movement, the Theodore Dalrymple writes
[1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:38.060]  about the themes of Wellbeck novels, the vacuity of modern life in the west, its lack of transcendence
[1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:43.060]  lived as it is increasingly without religious or political belief, without a worthwhile
[1:11:43.060 --> 1:11:48.780]  creative culture, often without deep personal attachments and without even a struggle for
[1:11:48.780 --> 1:11:53.260]  survival, into what Salman Rushdie called a God shaped whole has rushed the search for
[1:11:53.260 --> 1:11:59.380]  sensual pleasure which however, no more than distracts, and where is the church in all
[1:11:59.380 --> 1:12:05.020]  this, where are the firebrands railing against the vulgarity of modernity, affiliation with
[1:12:05.020 --> 1:12:10.700]  the church of England is at a record low, just 2% of young people are affiliated, and
[1:12:10.700 --> 1:12:18.620]  in the US alone, the Christian population decreased by nearly 8% between 2007 and 2014,
[1:12:18.620 --> 1:12:24.860]  where bulldozing churches and building ugly gigantic glassy monuments to insipid vacuity,
[1:12:24.860 --> 1:12:31.020]  great civilizations collapse when they experience a rapid and enduring loss of population and
[1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:36.580]  identity, the number of babies born to Muslims is expected to surpass those born to Christians
[1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:43.420]  between 2013 and 2035, Muslim fertility remains high while Christians are literally dying
[1:12:43.420 --> 1:12:48.700]  out, meanwhile the global leader of the Catholic church is the biggest cheerleader for his
[1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:54.340]  own flocks decline, if only there was a religious leader who understood the peril that we're
[1:12:54.340 --> 1:13:08.460]  hearing, we're feeling worried for the western world, what are you worried about, you know,
[1:13:08.460 --> 1:13:25.460]  what are you worried about, what are you worried about, what are you worried about, what are
[1:13:25.460 --> 1:13:54.700]  you worried about, anything, where are the conservatives in all this, giving giant corporations
[1:13:54.700 --> 1:13:59.580]  huge tax breaks so they can import vast quantities of people from the third world and then pay
[1:13:59.580 --> 1:14:06.140]  them slave wages while white Americans addicted to opioids live lives of atomized nihilistic
[1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:13.180]  hopelessness. Is that conservatism? At this point, what exactly are we conserving? Those
[1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:22.380]  GDP numbers though, is it conservative to allow Amazon to pay $0 in taxes on $11.2 billion
[1:14:22.380 --> 1:14:28.220]  on profit for 2018 and for progressives so long as Jeff Bezos virtue signals the right
[1:14:28.220 --> 1:14:34.140]  identity politics? Who cares, right? Great civilizations collapse when the economy serves
[1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:41.260]  not to elevate but to denigrate the population. We're now reaching this point. Our entire economy
[1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:47.180]  has become centered around a crony capitalist system that eviscerates the family, leading to
[1:14:47.180 --> 1:14:53.820]  atomization, misery and depression. In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-conservative Brookings
[1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:58.860]  institution found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in marriage rates
[1:14:58.860 --> 1:15:04.780]  over the past 35 years. Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close,
[1:15:04.780 --> 1:15:10.140]  marriage rates go down and single parenthood becomes more common. That, as you could guess,
[1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:15.740]  causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or in prison. So it's not a small thing.
[1:15:15.740 --> 1:15:21.500]  And by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over long periods of time.
[1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:27.340]  This is real. As French philosopher Eric Zamore outlines, the elite have stopped caring about
[1:15:27.340 --> 1:15:33.900]  native populations. Why? Because those populations no longer tolerate stagnant wage growth and
[1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:39.660]  diminished job prospects, simply to enslave themselves as a servant class for the elite.
[1:15:39.660 --> 1:15:46.060]  That's why they're on the streets rioting. So far, easier. Okay, that is the collapse of
[1:15:46.060 --> 1:15:51.740]  Western civilization. Part one. Part two is coming up after the break. And we'll get into
[1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:57.900]  more breaking news here on the Alex Jones Show Live. Infowars.com. Don't go away. We'll be back.
[1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:08.060]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.

[1:16:13.100 --> 1:16:19.420]  shows that World Wars One and Two left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to
[1:16:19.420 --> 1:16:25.660]  save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War

[1:18:18.380 --> 1:18:22.860]  the world. X2, it's available. I thought X3 is great. We still got another deep breath crystal
[1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:27.180]  source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine, the scientists that do that. It sold a
[1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:32.780]  lot, but people want original X2. I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through
[1:18:32.780 --> 1:18:38.780]  about a month ago. We now have X2 again at m4store.com. So, hallelujah. It's been sold out for about
[1:18:38.780 --> 1:18:45.820]  almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again,
[1:18:46.460 --> 1:18:52.620]  and we were able to do the exact same formula. We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out
[1:18:52.620 --> 1:18:56.620]  there. Learn about the iodine conspiracy. Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it.

[1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:09.180]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's
[1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:17.180]  one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed, and that's the
[1:19:17.180 --> 1:19:24.140]  videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the
[1:19:24.140 --> 1:19:30.620]  young turds and others, get so butt hurt when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory.
[1:19:30.620 --> 1:19:36.620]  They don't want us to remember what political action did, and that's why the globalist Hillary
[1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:42.060]  and others are trying to shut in fours now. This is a fight about taking your speech away,
[1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:47.020]  not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war,
[1:19:47.820 --> 1:19:51.740]  so again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't
[1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:55.260]  spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and
[1:19:55.260 --> 1:20:01.820]  fund us, in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. infowarstore.com.
[1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:08.540]  Thank you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:08.540 --> 1:20:23.420]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[1:20:23.420 --> 1:20:40.940]  We are back, and without further hesitation, let's go to part two of the collapse of western
[1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:46.860]  civilization. This video is up on YouTube right now. Please get it out there. Here it is, part two.
[1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:52.460]  As French philosopher Eric Zamore outlines, the elite have stopped caring about native
[1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:59.180]  populations. Why? Because those populations no longer tolerate stagnant wage growth and diminished
[1:20:59.180 --> 1:21:05.020]  job prospects, simply to enslave themselves as a servant class for the elite. That's why
[1:21:05.020 --> 1:21:11.660]  they're on the streets rioting, so far easier for the elite just to replace them with robots and a
[1:21:11.660 --> 1:21:17.980]  third world slave class. Great civilizations collapse when the supply of labor outstrips
[1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:24.140]  demand. We're now reaching this point. Great civilizations collapse when wealth inequality
[1:21:24.140 --> 1:21:29.100]  runs rampant. We're now reaching this point. Great civilizations collapse when the elite
[1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:34.540]  debases the currency to hide financial problems. We're now reaching this point.
[1:21:34.540 --> 1:21:38.300]  And the Democratic Party, for whatever reason, is not trying to address those problems.
[1:21:38.300 --> 1:21:45.020]  They're attacking Trump himself or the symptoms, but the disease is this pervasive economic
[1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:49.420]  insecurity as we make it harder and harder for Americans to find meaningful opportunities.
[1:21:49.420 --> 1:21:56.620]  Great civilizations collapse when the building block of society, the family unit crumbles into
[1:21:56.620 --> 1:22:02.140]  dust. We're now reaching this point. While Muslims in the West unite to rally around
[1:22:02.140 --> 1:22:08.380]  protection of their children, we treat ours like an unwanted medical waste product. While Muslims
[1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:13.740]  in the West refuse to allow their kids to be indoctrinated with warped sexual propaganda.
[1:22:13.740 --> 1:22:19.180]  We dress up ours as drag queens, parade them on television, and demand everyone embrace it as
[1:22:19.180 --> 1:22:25.580]  normal. It's not normal. There's something deeply wrong with what we've become. Now for all its
[1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:31.740]  barbarity, at least Islam provides its adherence with some sense of meaning and fulfillment.
[1:22:31.740 --> 1:22:39.100]  Time to join the winning team. The Mayan civilization collapsed when the Spanish
[1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:45.020]  invasion inflicted upon it a foreign culture intent on spreading its own systems of faith
[1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:52.140]  and governance, beginning to notice any parallels. Historically, the movement toward androgyny occurs
[1:22:52.140 --> 1:23:01.020]  in late phases of culture as a civilization is starting to unravel. And you can find it again
[1:23:01.020 --> 1:23:07.100]  and again and again through history in the Greek art. You can see it happening all of a sudden.
[1:23:07.100 --> 1:23:16.140]  There's a kind of the sculptures of handsome new young men athletes that used to be very robust
[1:23:16.140 --> 1:23:20.460]  in the archaic periods suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles toward the end.
[1:23:21.580 --> 1:23:27.420]  And the people who live in such periods, the late phase of culture, whether it's the Hellenistic
[1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:32.940]  era, whether it's the Roman Empire, whether it's the Moved Decade of Oscar Wilde in the 1890s,
[1:23:32.940 --> 1:23:38.300]  whether it's in Weimar Germany, people who live in such times feel that they're very sophisticated,
[1:23:38.300 --> 1:23:43.180]  they're very cosmopolitan. Homosexuality, heterosexuality, so what? Anything goes and so on.
[1:23:45.180 --> 1:23:49.660]  From the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer
[1:23:49.660 --> 1:23:58.140]  believes in itself. And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power
[1:23:58.140 --> 1:24:04.300]  of heroic masculinity on the edges, whether they're the vandals and the Huns or whether they're the
[1:24:04.300 --> 1:24:10.860]  barbarians of Isis. You see them starting to mass on the outsides of the culture and that's what
[1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:17.580]  we have right now. What does our culture provide? A tedious drip-drip of anodyne lethargic dross,
[1:24:17.580 --> 1:24:24.220]  or at the other end of the spectrum, a sewer pipe of obscene, tawdry hedonism. What does our society
[1:24:24.220 --> 1:24:29.820]  provide? A lifestyle of never talking to or knowing your neighbors, of aborting your babies,
[1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:35.420]  of cheating on your wives. A lifestyle of desperately searching for the next dopamine hit,
[1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:41.260]  whether that be from an Instagram-like, a pharmaceutical drug, or a new gadget. A lifestyle
[1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:48.780]  of strip malls, five-lane traffic, f*** recycled pop songs, f*** recycled movies, f*** recycled
[1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:55.820]  NPT celebrities, all spouting the same opinions. Our art may become so degenerate that future
[1:24:55.820 --> 1:25:02.940]  generations will be completely uninterested in it. And I'm sorry, but free market capitalism just
[1:25:02.940 --> 1:25:10.380]  doesn't cut it anymore as a purposeful credo to unite and fortify western civilization. It takes
[1:25:10.380 --> 1:25:17.180]  much more than an increasingly unjust economic system to maintain a civilization, which is why
[1:25:17.180 --> 1:25:23.980]  the enemies are at the gates waiting to take over. Which is why socialist vulture demagogues are busy
[1:25:23.980 --> 1:25:30.060]  licking their lips. We've abandoned the enlightenment values that build western civilization. We've
[1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:36.060]  abandoned the idea that family is fundamental to community strength and happiness. We've abandoned
[1:25:36.060 --> 1:25:43.020]  high culture in favor of lowbrow junk culture. We've abandoned stoic strength of character
[1:25:43.020 --> 1:25:49.900]  in favor of chemical dependence. We labor under an economic and political system that has abandoned
[1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:57.980]  us. We collectively killed God, well left with nothing authentic to believe in. That's why everyone's
[1:25:57.980 --> 1:26:03.820]  on drugs. That's why everyone's nihilistic. That's why everyone's unhappy. What's the solution?
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:11.580]  There is no solution. Every great civilization collapses on average every three hundred and
[1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:16.220]  thirty six years. And the collapse of ours is very much overdue.
[1:26:22.940 --> 1:26:29.180]  That is the collapse of western civilization. YouTube video available right now. It's got about
[1:26:29.180 --> 1:26:33.180]  three hundred and thirty thousand views overnight. So it seems to be going viral. A lot of people
[1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:37.980]  resonating with that. And in connection with that, we have a headline here out of Breitbart.
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:44.460]  Fertility falls in EU. Not one country hits population replacement level. I've talked about
[1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:51.420]  this many times before. You have a situation in major European cities like Frankfurt, like Antwerp,
[1:26:52.220 --> 1:26:57.580]  where immigrants are now the majority of the population. In Antwerp, Belgium, which is Belgium's
[1:26:57.580 --> 1:27:07.500]  most popular city, fifty two percent five to fifty two percent of the population are migrants. Problem
[1:27:07.500 --> 1:27:13.740]  being is that ninety percent, nine zero percent of those migrants vote for either left wing or
[1:27:13.740 --> 1:27:20.300]  far left wing parties. This is precisely why the elite are now importing their servant slave class.
[1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:24.780]  And by and large, that's a democratic party movement. But it's also a kind of
[1:27:24.780 --> 1:27:30.700]  coke brother's movement to bring in cheap labor. So we get crushed in the vice and everybody loses.
[1:27:30.700 --> 1:27:34.940]  They vote for left wing parties. They vote for parties who want bigger government. That's why
[1:27:34.940 --> 1:27:41.500]  they import the voting block. Now total births in the European Union's 28 member states in 2017
[1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:46.700]  has fallen from the year before. Well, first time mothers are now almost 30. So mothers are getting
[1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:53.580]  older. They're having less babies in Europe throughout Europe, which is why in Hungary,
[1:27:53.580 --> 1:28:02.300]  Viktor Orban introduced this policy where he gave newborn mothers thirty five thousand dollars
[1:28:02.300 --> 1:28:08.060]  to every woman. This is women who marry every woman under 40 who marries for the first time.
[1:28:08.060 --> 1:28:11.980]  And that loan is completely written off after the birth of her third child.
[1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:18.540]  Women who raise four or more children are now exempt from paying income tax for life in Hungary.
[1:28:18.540 --> 1:28:22.380]  Now a lot of people on the right are going to say, oh, my God, that's socialism. No, it's not.
[1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:28.220]  That's economic nationalism. That's building up your own population. That's basic survival.
[1:28:29.100 --> 1:28:35.020]  Meanwhile, in Europe, biggest released by Euro start and Tuesday revealed that there were 5.075
[1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:41.020]  million babies born in the union. That's less than the year before 5.148 million with a total
[1:28:41.020 --> 1:28:46.940]  fertility rate of 1.59 births per woman. Again, that's down on the year before.
[1:28:46.940 --> 1:28:54.380]  I'm well sure of 2.1 births per woman needed to maintain a population where literally dying out
[1:28:54.380 --> 1:28:58.700]  in the next segment. I'll talk about what exactly we're being replaced with. Join us
[1:28:58.700 --> 1:29:05.020]  at thisinforwars.com. We'll be back. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years

[1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:14.220]  I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands

[1:29:44.300 --> 1:29:49.500]  and died for. The one symbol that represents our Constitution. Now you can be a part of this great

[1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:18.460]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world
[1:30:18.460 --> 1:30:24.460]  is energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and
[1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:28.860]  synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in
[1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:34.140]  just a few hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research
[1:30:34.140 --> 1:30:41.100]  the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world. There's nothing

[1:30:46.620 --> 1:30:51.580]  packets to mix in fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very very strong,
[1:30:51.580 --> 1:30:56.140]  it lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it because TurboForce
[1:30:56.140 --> 1:31:21.980]  is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[1:31:26.460 --> 1:31:33.100]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:11.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:26.460]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:26.460 --> 1:33:30.300]  and now your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[1:33:33.020 --> 1:33:37.740]  So before the break, we were talking about these new fertility rates coming out of Europe.
[1:33:37.740 --> 1:33:43.900]  The replacement rate is not being met. It's 2.1 births per women. We're way below that in every
[1:33:43.900 --> 1:33:50.780]  European country. In terms of individual countries, France has the highest fertility rate at 1.9
[1:33:50.780 --> 1:33:57.100]  births per women. Now, my question is, do these births include newly arrived migrants? I'm presuming
[1:33:57.100 --> 1:34:03.420]  they do. So even with their births, which are way above what European native citizens are having,
[1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:10.940]  we have France at 1.9, followed by Sweden at 1.78, Ireland 1.77, UK is at 1.74,
[1:34:11.660 --> 1:34:17.820]  Spain is way down at 1.31. They're literally going to die out, which is interesting given that they
[1:34:17.820 --> 1:34:23.180]  had a socialist government swing into power last year and immediately open the borders.
[1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:28.220]  Again, the argument is always, oh, we need mass immigration because we need workers because we
[1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:34.220]  can't pay our pension obligations, even though the clear majority of those migrants in every case,
[1:34:34.220 --> 1:34:40.220]  both unskilled and skilled labor, go on to welfare immediately. So they're taking out more from the
[1:34:40.220 --> 1:34:44.780]  system than they're putting in. So that argument that you need a huge labor force doesn't even
[1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:53.420]  make sense economically. Cyprus is down to 1.32, Greece 1.35, Portugal 1.38. So the replacement
[1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:57.580]  level is way below what it should be. We're literally dying out and being replaced. Being
[1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:04.060]  replaced by what? Well, let's look at what's happening in Germany once again. This is the
[1:35:04.060 --> 1:35:09.100]  headline out of Breitbart. Germany, migrant crimes concealed to avoid stirring up prejudice,
[1:35:09.100 --> 1:35:13.580]  authorities in a district of rural Germany, covered up a long list of asylum seeker crimes,
[1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:17.580]  including rape, assault, and child sex abuse. So as not to stir up prejudice,
[1:35:17.580 --> 1:35:23.020]  it has been alleged. This is not the first time we've seen this kind of report. We had the main
[1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:32.140]  German broadcaster ZDF come out two plus years ago and admit that they, as a television network,
[1:35:32.140 --> 1:35:39.180]  do not report on crimes committed by migrants. You have a situation in Germany where even
[1:35:39.180 --> 1:35:45.900]  while these statistics are being covered up and depressed, there's been a 10% rise in violent
[1:35:45.900 --> 1:35:52.300]  crime. 90% of that rise is attributable to migrants. Now, Trump came out about a year ago and said,
[1:35:53.260 --> 1:35:58.140]  Germany has a bigger problem with crime. Crime is rising in Germany. They came out and said,
[1:35:58.140 --> 1:36:04.140]  no, that's fake news. That's not true because they took all crime. Violent crime is rising,
[1:36:04.140 --> 1:36:09.020]  and it's mostly attributable to migrants. Those are the statistics coming out from the German
[1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:16.540]  government, okay? Not a right-wing news source. So now internal police figures reveal 117 criminal
[1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:21.020]  offenses took place at refugee housing in Bustet, northern Germany, during the last three months,
[1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:25.580]  and that third world migrants housed in other accommodation in the municipality were listed
[1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:31.980]  as suspects in a further 23 crimes. But officers neglected to announce the incidents after orders
[1:36:31.980 --> 1:36:37.420]  from the Interior Ministry, that's the government, instructed police the active notifications from
[1:36:37.420 --> 1:36:43.740]  the forces press office on potential migrant involvement in crimes would be, quote, irresponsible
[1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:50.380]  and likely to stir up prejudice. We've had stories about this before where they literally say,
[1:36:50.380 --> 1:36:55.820]  the police say, we've been ordered to lie about migrant crime statistics because the government
[1:36:55.820 --> 1:37:01.500]  claims it's going to stir up civil unrest and riots amongst the German population. So they'd
[1:37:01.500 --> 1:37:07.580]  rather just hide it and leave victims wide open to abuse. An absolutely ridiculous situation.
[1:37:08.780 --> 1:37:12.060]  We had this article from back in February from Infowars.com.
[1:37:13.100 --> 1:37:16.620]  German police lie about migrant crime statistics to preserve peace.
[1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:21.660]  German police officers hide the severity of migrant crime statistics in order to preserve
[1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:27.820]  civil peace according to recent news report. And that, again, talks to the police officers who
[1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:34.620]  say we've been directed by our superiors to literally bury and obfuscate migrant crimes
[1:37:34.620 --> 1:37:40.380]  in our reports when we file reports about rapes, about assaults, about violent crimes.
[1:37:40.940 --> 1:37:44.220]  Meanwhile, those who do commit the crimes are being treated with kid gloves.
[1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:49.900]  This is out of bright spot. Syrian migrant murderer acquitted due to psychiatric illness
[1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:56.380]  caused by war trauma. This was a 24 year old Syrian asylum seeker who stabbed his boss to death at
[1:37:56.380 --> 1:38:02.860]  work and was acquitted in a German court due to psychiatric issues caused by his past in Syria.
[1:38:02.860 --> 1:38:07.420]  So as long as you say that you travel through a war-torn country, apparently in Germany,
[1:38:07.420 --> 1:38:14.380]  that literally allows you to get away with murder. The Syrian was mentally disturbed and
[1:38:14.380 --> 1:38:21.500]  carried out the attack in an act of paranoid fit of rage, the express reports. 24 year old apparently
[1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:24.940]  believed in various paranoid delusions before the murder, including that he was being secretly
[1:38:24.940 --> 1:38:29.660]  monitored and spied on. So he just claimed that because he'd been through a war-torn country
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:37.020]  and had mental problems that that made him viciously attack and murder his boss, then he got away
[1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:44.140]  with murder. Meanwhile, in Italy, Italian girl murdered by Nigerian migrants likely dismembered
[1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:50.300]  alive. Remember, this was the 18 year old girl who they found the body parts of literally in a
[1:38:50.300 --> 1:38:57.020]  suitcase on the side of the road. Well, now Italian teen Pamela Mastropietro, who was murdered by
[1:38:57.020 --> 1:39:03.580]  migrant Nigerian mobsters last year. Huge problem with Nigerian mobsters in Italy as we've spoken
[1:39:03.580 --> 1:39:09.500]  about before, was likely dismembered alive. The horrifying revelations come from the testimony
[1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:16.460]  of Vincenzo Marino, a key witness in the trial of Nigerian drug dealer, Innocent Osagale,
[1:39:16.460 --> 1:39:22.940]  how ironic is that name, who stands accused of murdering the teenage girl. Mastropietro had
[1:39:22.940 --> 1:39:27.900]  become estranged from her family, became addicted to drugs after a brief relationship with a Romanian
[1:39:27.900 --> 1:39:34.300]  man, her mother claims. And then Marino says that he overheard the Nigerian migrant mobster
[1:39:34.860 --> 1:39:41.580]  admit to the murder and admit that he dismembered the corpse while the 18 year old girl was still
[1:39:41.580 --> 1:39:49.900]  alive from the feet up. This is the cultural enrichment we're experiencing throughout Europe.
[1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:53.900]  Italy has experienced the massive crime wave since the influx of hundreds of thousands of
[1:39:53.900 --> 1:39:59.740]  sub-Saharan migrants, particularly from Nigeria. Remember what Macron said? He wanted to turn
[1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:06.700]  France, he wanted to turn Europe into Arabia by literally importing 150 million to 200 million
[1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:14.620]  Africans over the next 10, 15 years. Meanwhile, 18 year old Italian teenage girls are literally
[1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:22.380]  being dismembered alive and found in suitcases. Absolutely disgusting. This is the situation
[1:40:22.380 --> 1:40:28.540]  we're dealing with in Europe. This is what's coming to America if you follow the same course.
[1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:33.740]  And now you see the video which I put up about a year ago now. We probably won't have time to
[1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:40.380]  play it, but as this is happening in Germany, as violent crime is on the increase, as people who
[1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:45.100]  commit vicious murders are being acquitted because they say they travel through water on countries,
[1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:50.700]  as the police are ordered to hide, bury the reports of violent crime, you have German television
[1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:57.100]  shows in their cell poppers literally having white mothers convert their children to Islam
[1:40:57.100 --> 1:41:04.380]  and do Islamic prayers. You have models white six foot German women wearing hijabs saying
[1:41:04.380 --> 1:41:11.740]  embrace diversity as they dance around in hijabs. So while the population is being outright lied
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:17.340]  to, now you see the advert enjoy different start tolerances. I think it was a UN related advert
[1:41:17.340 --> 1:41:22.460]  that played on German television. While the media, while the police are being ordered to lie to the
[1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:30.060]  German population, they're simultaneously brainwashing them, indoctrinating and indoctrinating them
[1:41:30.060 --> 1:41:35.980]  into Islamophilia. Because again, that's far easier than just facing up to the full scale of the
[1:41:35.980 --> 1:41:42.860]  problem that occurred after Angela Merkel invited some 2 million predominantly Muslim migrants
[1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:50.300]  into the country from 2015 onwards. And we went to Dresden, Germany as an Infowars crew back in
[1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:56.220]  2016 to cover the Bilderberg conference. But again, you talk to the locals, there was a refugee
[1:41:56.220 --> 1:42:02.860]  centre nearby and we saw it with our own eyes. The refugees would come out, hang around, congregate
[1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:07.980]  around the train station. The police would leave them alone by and large and then they would go
[1:42:07.980 --> 1:42:14.140]  out and literally harass teenage girls. I saw it with my own eyes. The taxi drivers that we spoke
[1:42:14.140 --> 1:42:18.940]  to said that they were dealing drugs, that the crime in the area had increased. This is the
[1:42:18.940 --> 1:42:23.900]  cultural enrichment that Angela Merkel is to blame for, which is why she's got her lowest
[1:42:23.900 --> 1:42:31.100]  approval rating ever. This is the situation we're dealing with. Meanwhile, European mothers
[1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:37.420]  are not having babies. The fertility rate is not up to par and it's a long, long way off. That's why
[1:42:37.420 --> 1:42:43.100]  we need more policies like Orban's introduced in Hungary, where you literally pay people to get
[1:42:43.100 --> 1:42:49.740]  married, where you forgive them of income tax if they have four children. That's the medicine that
[1:42:49.740 --> 1:42:55.980]  we need. It's not socialism, it's basically protecting your own national heritage. This is
[1:42:55.980 --> 1:43:00.060]  the Alex Jones Show Live. We'll be back to talk about Brexit in the next segment. Don't go away.
[1:43:01.820 --> 1:43:05.660]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners. This was going to
[1:43:05.660 --> 1:43:09.340]  be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore for a year and a half fight,

[1:45:02.540 --> 1:45:07.020]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there
[1:45:07.020 --> 1:45:11.660]  for my children someday. So I need to make them strong now. Now I can be there for my children.
[1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:16.700]  Now I can make them strong. Now I can instruct them. Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[1:45:16.700 --> 1:45:19.900]  But not once I'm gone. You think of this digital age, your word's going forever,
[1:45:19.900 --> 1:45:22.940]  but now they're even better. Getting rid of what you said they were before.
[1:45:22.940 --> 1:45:28.220]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning,
[1:45:28.220 --> 1:45:33.660]  isn't it? But I have joined my will to the resistance. I can't be destroyed now. As long
[1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:38.300]  as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed

[1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:33.820]  and slammed the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, headline Trump Brexit negotiation where badly
[1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:38.700]  PM May didn't listen to my advice. And he's basically come out and said,
[1:48:40.300 --> 1:48:44.540]  he's surprised at how badly the Brexit negotiations have gone. He said he's surprised
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:49.980]  at how badly they've gone and that the EU is tearing the country apart. He says that Theresa
[1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:54.940]  May did not listen to his suggestions on how to handle the negotiations. You would have thought
[1:48:54.940 --> 1:48:59.500]  that the guy who had the art of the deal, one of the most successful businessmen of all time,
[1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:02.780]  would have had an input into Theresa May. Now, she did not listen.
[1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:09.180]  Basically now, Trump needs to openly say that the UK is not behaving like a democratic country,
[1:49:09.180 --> 1:49:13.740]  needs to come out and make that kind of statement. That could force Theresa May's hand to want to
[1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:19.100]  Brexit. It could at least embarrass her, will take anything at this point. They voted to take no
[1:49:19.100 --> 1:49:26.460]  deal off the table. So now the EU knows that we have absolutely no cards. We're holding no cards
[1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:31.660]  whatsoever. That worked in their favor once again. Now we have this headline out of Breitbart,
[1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:38.700]  report EU plots, two-year Brexit delay, officials prepare for UK to join EU elections.
[1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:43.820]  Again, this was designed to fail from the very beginning. We had a remainder globalist cabinet
[1:49:43.820 --> 1:49:49.740]  pushing the deal. Theresa May who voted remain not even going into the negotiations with a strong
[1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:55.020]  hand deliberately so she could get raped over the coals. Now the European Union is pushing for a
[1:49:55.020 --> 1:49:59.740]  lengthy extension of Britain's negotiations for Brexit, pushing the exit day well beyond March
[1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:05.020]  29th and leaving British officials to plan for Britain to participate in the European Parliamentary
[1:50:05.020 --> 1:50:12.060]  elections in May if nothing has changed. Now if that happens, you're going to get dozens of Nigel
[1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:18.540]  forages running as MEPs and in fact I know some of them who are planning to do so. Labour Party,
[1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:24.940]  Conservative Party will both get absolutely walloped as they deserve because they're betraying
[1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:30.540]  Brexit. So they had a vote today on taking no deal off the table. They had another vote on a
[1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:38.140]  second referendum. We voted to leave the European Union nearly three years ago now. It hasn't happened.
[1:50:38.140 --> 1:50:43.020]  They've been pushing for this second referendum which would completely override the very notion of
[1:50:43.020 --> 1:50:49.500]  democracy. Now they had the losers vote today. Thankfully it failed by a wide margin. So at
[1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:55.260]  least that is off the table for now. Now we're going to have another vote in Parliament tonight
[1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:59.500]  to delay Brexit once again. They're going to try and kick the can down the road
[1:50:59.500 --> 1:51:04.460]  for as long as humanly possible and hope that everybody loses steam, that everybody loses
[1:51:04.460 --> 1:51:11.340]  motivation. We wait to see what happens. We have a headline here out of RT. No delay from EU or we
[1:51:11.340 --> 1:51:17.340]  elect 73 Nigel forages into European Parliament. So that's basically what they're facing.
[1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:23.020]  Brexit as I warned was being betrayed from the start. Every European country that voted against
[1:51:23.020 --> 1:51:28.780]  the interests of the EU, the vote was done over and over again until they got the result they
[1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:35.420]  wanted because again, this is not a democratic institution. This is an authoritarian institution
[1:51:35.420 --> 1:51:41.020]  and that's exactly why we need out of it. Absolutely incredible situation.
[1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:47.180]  Meanwhile back in the US, one of the democratic candidates who I actually agree with on many
[1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:51.980]  issues is Tulsi Gabbard. She's the only one who is against the deep state war machine.
[1:51:51.980 --> 1:51:58.460]  She appeared on Stephen Colbert for a hostile interview. We have that clip. We're going to roll
[1:51:58.460 --> 1:52:04.460]  it right now. Here it is. I don't know whether America should be the policeman of the world.
[1:52:04.460 --> 1:52:10.300]  But it is my opinion that we should not be. If we are not involved in international conflicts
[1:52:10.300 --> 1:52:15.740]  or trying to quell international conflicts that might destabilize in the world because the United
[1:52:15.740 --> 1:52:21.260]  States, however flawed, is a force for good in the world in my opinion. Would you agree with that?
[1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:30.700]  I do agree with that. My point is that in order to be a force for good, we must actually do good.
[1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:38.380]  The consequences of these regime change war policies has been horrible. It has been completely
[1:52:38.380 --> 1:52:44.780]  the opposite of that intention. The real question here that is important for us, the American people
[1:52:44.780 --> 1:52:49.820]  and our government, is how destructive these regime change wars are on the people in the
[1:52:49.820 --> 1:52:56.140]  countries where we are supposedly trying to help them, as well as how destructive they are to us,
[1:52:56.140 --> 1:53:00.700]  the American people here at home, both from a security perspective and the fact that we
[1:53:00.700 --> 1:53:05.660]  don't have enough money to pay for health care for everyone, that we don't have enough money
[1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:10.700]  to pay for education, to rebuild our infrastructure, the urgent needs that our people have right here
[1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:18.220]  at home. So every time Tulsi Gabbard goes on one of these shows, they savage her for supporting the
[1:53:18.220 --> 1:53:24.300]  butcher, the dictator Assad. She was one of the lone, reasonable, rational voices from the very
[1:53:24.300 --> 1:53:30.940]  beginning on the left speaking out against regime change, against disastrous foreign intervention,
[1:53:30.940 --> 1:53:37.420]  against supporting ISIS in their war to topple Assad, which is exactly what we did in Iraq and
[1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:43.180]  basically created the rise of ISIS throughout the region. That's what we did in Libya and created
[1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:48.860]  the migrant crisis. So she goes on there with consistent foreign policy principles,
[1:53:48.860 --> 1:53:54.860]  which have proven to be rational and reasonable in the past. And she's attacked by Stephen Colbert,
[1:53:55.420 --> 1:54:02.780]  a guy that cut his teeth, a guy that rose to prominence by being the anti-war, anti-George W.
[1:54:02.780 --> 1:54:09.020]  Bush guy. Remember the famous White House press correspondence dinner where he savage George Bush
[1:54:09.020 --> 1:54:14.460]  over the war in Iraq. Now that Stephen Colbert has basically joined the deep state, he's suddenly
[1:54:14.460 --> 1:54:21.100]  pro-war and pro-foreign intervention just because a Republican is in office, just because a Republican
[1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:27.820]  in the form of Donald Trump is not going along with the war party. Absolute stunning hypocrisy
[1:54:27.820 --> 1:54:34.300]  and double standards from Stephen Colbert. But what do you expect? Meanwhile, there's a headline
[1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:40.860]  here at the New York Post. Is this bearded hipster proof that all anti-conformists look alike?
[1:54:40.860 --> 1:54:47.420]  This is absolutely hilarious. MIT Technology Review published an article outlining the hipster
[1:54:47.420 --> 1:54:52.460]  effect, a phenomenon in which people eager to define themselves away from the mainstream
[1:54:52.460 --> 1:54:59.260]  all end up looking alike. Think ironic, facial hair, earthy flannels and craft brews in hand.
[1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:06.620]  So basically, this guy, they used a stock image of a hipster for this MIT Technology Review article
[1:55:06.620 --> 1:55:12.300]  and an outraged man threatened legal action against the publication for using his image to illustrate
[1:55:12.300 --> 1:55:20.700]  the article, only to find out that the image was not of him. Thereby proving the entire point of
[1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:27.020]  the article, the entire point of the study that all hipsters look alike. The more they try to be
[1:55:27.020 --> 1:55:33.900]  non-conformists, the more they conform. It says the term hipster effect was originally coined by
[1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:40.460]  the mathematician Jonathan Tabool of Brandis University, who used the Markov model Stochastic
[1:55:40.460 --> 1:55:46.460]  Evolution and other theoretical statistics to prove his point that anti-conformist individuals
[1:55:46.460 --> 1:55:52.140]  all look the same. So when this article came out, when he threatened legal action, they basically
[1:55:52.140 --> 1:55:58.060]  came back to this hipster and said, that's not you, it just looks like you, because all hipsters
[1:55:58.060 --> 1:56:05.980]  look the same, and you just proved our entire point. Meanwhile, not satire social democrats
[1:56:05.980 --> 1:56:11.580]  want to integrate ISIS fighters with the help of radical mosques. This is out of, well, it's
[1:56:11.580 --> 1:56:15.260]  got to be Germany or Sweden, hasn't it, one of the two, and it's Germany in this instance.
[1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:22.300]  German Interior Minister Andreas Giesel of the SPD is currently checking if returning ISIS fighters
[1:56:22.300 --> 1:56:28.780]  can be integrated with the use of radical mosques in Berlin. So they're literally not only saying,
[1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:34.780]  yes, fine, we'll accept, we'll re-admit all these ISIS terrorists that literally beheaded people,
[1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:40.780]  come on in for a bit more cultural enrichment in Germany, they're now going to reintegrate them
[1:56:40.780 --> 1:56:47.580]  with the aid of other Islamists in radical mosques. Gunnar Schauplis, a journalist that
[1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:54.220]  tabloid BZ said, that the proposal sounds like Giesel wants to use the arsonists to put out
[1:56:54.220 --> 1:57:00.300]  the fire. They're literally going to radical mosques, going to radical Islamists and saying,
[1:57:00.300 --> 1:57:06.460]  you can help us, we integrate ISIS fighters into Germany. Completely insane. Meanwhile,
[1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:11.660]  a woman told to cover up before flying out of diverse UK city of Birmingham. This was up on
[1:57:11.660 --> 1:57:17.740]  infowars.com. Basically, it was a woman who wore a crop top. She got on a plane flying out of
[1:57:17.740 --> 1:57:24.940]  Birmingham, UK, where the population is 25% Muslim. Somebody, we don't know who,
[1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:30.380]  complained about it and said that this was not modest enough. So again, literally enforcing
[1:57:30.380 --> 1:57:38.300]  modesty culture, she was asked to leave the plane unless she covered up. Absolutely incredible.
[1:57:38.300 --> 1:57:43.020]  Of course, nothing to do with the fact that 25% of the population in Birmingham is Muslim
[1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:48.780]  and 50,000 of the inhabitants don't even speak English. This is the Alex Jones Show Live

[1:59:55.260 --> 1:59:57.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:59:57.980 --> 2:00:09.980]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:12.460 --> 2:00:16.540]  I mean the way they decided to de-platform Alex Jones was highly subjective,
[2:00:16.540 --> 2:00:20.860]  very interpretive and I've seen far worse conduct. I mean for example the Covington case,
[2:00:20.860 --> 2:00:25.180]  you had a prominent Hollywood figure show an image of saying the Covington kid should have
[2:00:25.180 --> 2:00:29.980]  to go through a shredder and be killed. You had Ray Zaslaw calling him to be punched in the face.
[2:00:30.860 --> 2:00:36.220]  Nothing was done about that. And yet Alex Jones posts something that's just a funny video and
[2:00:36.220 --> 2:00:39.260]  they're like oh my goodness we have to get rid of Alex Jones. Okay so I want to spend a whole
[2:00:39.260 --> 2:00:44.780]  bunch of time on Covington because I think actually that was the moment that this shifted and maybe
[2:00:44.780 --> 2:00:48.220]  at a legal sense it crystallized in my mind a little bit more. That's actually when I reached
[2:00:48.220 --> 2:00:52.620]  out to you because I saw you just going for it and I thought okay this is a conversation we have
[2:00:52.620 --> 2:00:57.180]  to have but let's talk about Jones for a minute. So Jones, so you've done some defense work with
[2:00:57.180 --> 2:01:01.500]  Jones. Yes I'm representing Alex Jones in Info Wars and now his outside general counsel on all
[2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:05.980]  these legal matters. So you represent him across the board on all of these things. So I guess
[2:01:05.980 --> 2:01:11.340]  my first question is what's it like when Alex Jones knocks on your door or calls you up?
[2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:15.900]  He's a very animated guy, very nice guy, very open, very sincere. What was fascinating is from the
[2:01:15.900 --> 2:01:21.020]  get-go he was saying 90% of what they're saying about me isn't the case. He's like I would defend
[2:01:21.020 --> 2:01:25.980]  this on free speech and free press grounds anyway but what they're actually saying I said I didn't
[2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:29.900]  say I never attacked these families I never went after these family I never told people to go to
[2:01:29.900 --> 2:01:33.820]  the family's homes none of that. Yeah so this is that stuff specifically is about the Sandy Hook
[2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:38.620]  case. Exactly Sandy Hook case and so that they took a media matters video and assumed that's
[2:01:38.620 --> 2:01:42.860]  what I said and it wasn't really they took most of that out of context and didn't put in that I
[2:01:42.860 --> 2:01:47.900]  corrected the record long time ago and so part of it was you know very nice guy actually very
[2:01:47.900 --> 2:01:52.460]  friendly guy very accessible guy even more so than Snipes he gets mobbed when he goes out in
[2:01:52.460 --> 2:01:57.100]  public with people running selfies and that sort of thing and he doesn't act like the Jaguar did
[2:01:57.100 --> 2:02:02.780]  with the lady he's very nice and sociable and friendly. So he runs a you know nice small business
[2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:08.140]  enterprise you know access TV to talk radio to internet and he's intended to be the poster boy
[2:02:08.140 --> 2:02:13.260]  of their de-platforming campaigns. They when I told the press is this case really isn't about Alex
[2:02:13.260 --> 2:02:18.300]  Jones it's about the ability of the independent press to operate will lawfare be discriminately
[2:02:18.300 --> 2:02:22.940]  or desperately used against ordinary individuals in the same way that de-platforming is happening
[2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:27.420]  already in the big tech space and so are we going to protect a little guy or not and Alex Jones
[2:02:27.420 --> 2:02:31.420]  they figured would be the convenient they would sort of create a parody of them a caricature of
[2:02:31.420 --> 2:02:35.420]  them that they could get the public to believe make them make the audience feel bad if they
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:41.100]  watch him the may feel guilty to be associated or attached with him and as soon as my representation
[2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:45.900]  was announced and another lawyer Norm Pattis big old school civil rights lawyer in Connecticut
[2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:49.420]  I think he's thought of ponytail I mean he's old school yeah he had friends and family members
[2:02:49.420 --> 2:02:53.580]  that are connected to what happened at Sandy Hook so he immediately you know wanted to be
[2:02:53.580 --> 2:02:57.820]  involved in the case as soon as he was Huffington Post writes a hit piece on they don't talk about
[2:02:57.820 --> 2:03:01.660]  a civil rights legacy they don't talk about any of that it's entire the whole thing is intended
[2:03:01.660 --> 2:03:06.300]  to smear him and to send a message that if you're a lawyer and you dare defend Alex Jones we're
[2:03:06.300 --> 2:03:10.380]  going to try to destroy your reputation in the public space and that's exactly the problem
[2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:15.420]  that needs to be fixed and remedied yeah so related to Jones specifically I mean one of the things
[2:03:15.420 --> 2:03:21.020]  that I thought was was most incredible I forget the exact order of it but basically within 48 hours
[2:03:21.020 --> 2:03:25.900]  all the platforms took him down yes and it's like okay is that is that that you guys truly
[2:03:25.900 --> 2:03:31.020]  are calling each other and coordinating it or is it that you're all sort of cowards you somebody
[2:03:31.020 --> 2:03:35.740]  breaks the ice and now you're just followers and I don't know that it matters either way right it
[2:03:35.740 --> 2:03:40.620]  probably doesn't matter either way but what I thought was okay it doesn't even matter what he has said
[2:03:40.620 --> 2:03:48.220]  short of breaking an American law in my opinion the real issue here is that if he can't be on there
[2:03:48.860 --> 2:03:53.740]  then why is Farrakhan on there I'm not even I'm not making a comparison direct comparison
[2:03:53.740 --> 2:03:58.620]  then why is Hamas on there we could do a billion other things you know the disparity is obvious
[2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:02.380]  and evident there are people who've said far worse things that just happen to have a different
[2:04:02.380 --> 2:04:06.780]  ideological intellectual perspective it was even if you took all the accusations against them at
[2:04:06.780 --> 2:04:11.420]  face value and 90 percent of them are not true the what and that's your typical smear campaign
[2:04:11.420 --> 2:04:16.060]  the conservative or the person on the right or the person some on the independent anti-war left
[2:04:16.060 --> 2:04:19.980]  will often be attacked and smeared 90 percent of what's said about them is not true but even
[2:04:19.980 --> 2:04:24.620]  if it was true what the other side has said is usually far worse and far more greatest and far
[2:04:24.620 --> 2:04:29.260]  more excessive and it's the obvious disparate treatment they're using their their concentrated
[2:04:29.260 --> 2:04:36.220]  power to uh and including their lawfare power to effectively wipe out the little guy so that only
[2:04:36.220 --> 2:04:39.820]  the big guy's voice is heard and also means about the audience because that was John's
[2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:43.900]  still going to talk it's just can the audience hear him so it's about their right to choose
[2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:47.420]  their right to choose what news they want to look at what views they want to have
[2:04:47.420 --> 2:05:00.620]  what how they filter information
[2:05:00.620 --> 2:05:08.060]  i've got some really good news though x2 is back the original x2 deep breath crystal pure
[2:05:08.060 --> 2:05:14.380]  atomic iodine what you want in forestore.com it'll be here in a week manufactured in the us

[2:05:28.540 --> 2:05:33.340]  the fact we didn't have x2 but it it came through about a month ago we now have x2 again
[2:05:33.340 --> 2:05:38.940]  and in forestore.com so hallelujah it's been sold out for about almost three months but we have now
[2:05:38.940 --> 2:05:47.100]  we have the same company the original x2 develop it again and we were able to do the exact same

[2:06:31.260 --> 2:06:35.100]  and i didn't do it because i don't support the president i didn't do it to get brownie points
[2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:40.780]  with hillary clinton i did it because he's not defending the first amendment he's not standing
[2:06:40.780 --> 2:06:48.220]  up against big cartels of big tech openly involved in organized racketeering against
[2:06:48.220 --> 2:06:52.140]  nationalists against christians against conservatives against second amendment groups
[2:06:52.140 --> 2:06:58.220]  veterans groups hunting fishing groups you name it there is a rain of terror going on
[2:06:58.220 --> 2:07:02.780]  and the president's saying well just be well behaved we've got to be better than democrats
[2:07:02.780 --> 2:07:09.260]  that does cut it so i'll talk more about that coming up in the next segment and we've got

[2:07:46.300 --> 2:07:53.420]  states yesterday and i'm on the plane looking at the internet on my phone as the president grounds
[2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:58.220]  the aircraft and i look up and it's got on the computer screen right there with the in-flight
[2:07:58.220 --> 2:08:06.060]  announcements that i'm on a max seven thirty seven uh eight hundred which i guess is the same as an
[2:08:06.060 --> 2:08:12.460]  eight or nine the point is that i said is this the plane that's just been grounded and they said yes
[2:08:13.020 --> 2:08:19.740]  but don't worry the pilots say that it's just a autopilot problem and that they're not training
[2:08:19.740 --> 2:08:26.300]  these third world uh companies in africa and in asia and that all they got to do is hit two buttons
[2:08:26.300 --> 2:08:31.740]  and the autopilot's off that if they don't think the plane's going fast enough the robot the computer
[2:08:31.740 --> 2:08:38.860]  uh basically starts putting the nose down and then if pilots fight it they can't fight it'll
[2:08:38.860 --> 2:08:43.500]  take you all the way down it tends to happen on takeoff at a certain point if the plane slows
[2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:49.100]  i go wow how do you know all this and and he goes well i'm actually a pilot in private life
[2:08:49.100 --> 2:08:52.860]  working towards my commercial license so then later i had a chance once we got off the plane real
[2:08:52.860 --> 2:08:57.740]  quick to talk to the pilot he confirmed all that but while i'm on the couple hour flight back in the
[2:08:57.740 --> 2:09:03.340]  u.s i'm reading all the articles confirming that there's all these federal registry complaints
[2:09:03.340 --> 2:09:08.140]  and all these admissions by pilots that it's the autopilot and that it's super dangerous that even
[2:09:08.140 --> 2:09:14.300]  u.s carriers didn't teach them in the last year when these planes rolled out that when the autopilot
[2:09:14.300 --> 2:09:20.300]  glitches with a bad sensor you just turn the autopilot off so pilots have all talked and
[2:09:20.300 --> 2:09:24.620]  figured this out so when this happened five six days ago i already knew i bet it's autopilot
[2:09:24.620 --> 2:09:29.900]  because pilots are complaining that new pilots especially don't know how to fly planes they may
[2:09:29.900 --> 2:09:34.300]  get their license go through their hours get trained through simulators through regional carriers
[2:09:34.300 --> 2:09:41.340]  finally get on a big jet well then a few years of flying around on these big jets with autopilot
[2:09:41.340 --> 2:09:45.340]  that's so incredibly good you ever wonder why landings are so much smoother than used to be
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:51.660]  remember when you were a kid or even a teenager if you're older like i am 45 50 60 70 remember like
[2:09:51.660 --> 2:09:58.780]  remember like even on sunny days i mean boom boom boom you ever wonder why it's just so damn smooth
[2:09:58.780 --> 2:10:05.580]  when you come in like it's because the autopilot is amazing the same autopilot they had in the
[2:10:05.580 --> 2:10:11.180]  80s that could shoot cruise missiles down people's chimneys or through their windows but what happens
[2:10:11.180 --> 2:10:15.820]  when it messes up and the humans don't know what to do and so a lot of pilots have pointed out
[2:10:15.820 --> 2:10:25.260]  this is criminal negligence that the manuals do not tell people what to do when this happens
[2:10:25.260 --> 2:10:31.500]  so sure american airlines delta airlines things like quantas things you know top brand things like
[2:10:31.500 --> 2:10:37.420]  virgin things like british airways southwest has good pilots they've all been taught about this
[2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:44.540]  workaround this glitch in the autopilot sensor but i made some calls when this first happened
[2:10:44.540 --> 2:10:49.100]  five days ago people like oh it's the autopilot i called some pilots and then sure enough for the
[2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:55.020]  show for the news but still the media section like well is it autopilot so the problem is the autopilot
[2:10:55.020 --> 2:11:00.060]  we all know what's doing it you just have to put the pilots through a training regimen that if the
[2:11:00.060 --> 2:11:05.340]  plane is slowing down on takeoff you know at six seven eight thousand feet because you're you're
[2:11:05.340 --> 2:11:11.180]  ascending if the plane thing is going too slow it doesn't want to stall out the computer drops the
[2:11:11.180 --> 2:11:19.900]  nose pilots start fighting that the computer overrides you're dead and the pilots don't even know
[2:11:21.180 --> 2:11:26.700]  that it's an autopilot problem which again you go back 40 something years ago Texas Instruments
[2:11:26.700 --> 2:11:32.300]  comes out with a calculator before then everybody knew how to do arithmetic you the average person
[2:11:32.300 --> 2:11:38.380]  should do any type of algebra any type of other equations you needed hell i was pretty good because
[2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:44.060]  they wouldn't let us back in high school use calculators i was okay at math nowadays i don't
[2:11:44.060 --> 2:11:50.460]  know the first thing about math i use a calculator and again the machines are making us weak i'm not
[2:11:50.460 --> 2:11:55.020]  against the machines it's just they're making us weak and we always get a human there that knows
[2:11:55.020 --> 2:12:01.500]  how to run it if the machine doesn't that keeps humans the equation and that's what i trust and
[2:12:01.500 --> 2:12:06.380]  you take trump had a great tweet on this and we can pull it up but he basically said i believe in
[2:12:06.380 --> 2:12:13.260]  humans involved not some Einstein program computer that could have a glitch because we all know sometimes
[2:12:13.980 --> 2:12:19.740]  your car stalls out and you've got the power steering and you're you may be strong you can't
[2:12:19.740 --> 2:12:24.700]  control that car that's scary i like the old-fashioned cars where if you ran out of gas or
[2:12:24.700 --> 2:12:30.460]  things stalled you were controlling the wheel and it's the same thing humans are being removed
[2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:38.460]  from the equation self-driving cars self-flying airplanes algorithms all the dinners that you
[2:12:38.460 --> 2:12:43.500]  know cook themselves and so nobody knows how to cook a meal we're losing our humanity and it's
[2:12:43.500 --> 2:12:49.180]  fulfilling the garden it's fulfilling to cook pasta or cook chicken or steaks it's fulfilling
[2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:55.500]  to do carpentry we're meant to build things we built the machines let's not let the machines
[2:12:55.500 --> 2:13:01.500]  take over our lives but the big takeaway is there's a debate five six how many days is it into this
[2:13:01.500 --> 2:13:08.460]  now what caused it who knows ground all the planes it's the same old 737 badass airframe big juicy
[2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:14.380]  engines great avionics the best equipment ever but there's a glitch in the sensor and the pilots
[2:13:14.380 --> 2:13:20.140]  are in the federal register for a year all over the u.s. and the world saying the autopilot's
[2:13:20.140 --> 2:13:26.860]  got a glitch we have to play dumb kill bowing stock by 30 instead of fixing the bug insanity
[2:13:26.860 --> 2:13:31.260]  let's go to the president laying the grounding out from yesterday here it is
[2:13:31.820 --> 2:13:37.980]  to make a announcement very shortly regarding the new information and physical evidence that
[2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:45.740]  we've received from the site and from other locations and through a couple of other complaints
[2:13:45.740 --> 2:14:00.220]  we've had a very very detailed group of people working on the 737 8 and the 737 9 new airplanes
[2:14:01.740 --> 2:14:08.540]  we're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737
[2:14:08.540 --> 2:14:20.300]  max 8 and the 737 max 9 and planes associated with that line i've spoken to elaine chow
[2:14:20.300 --> 2:14:29.100]  secretary of transportation dan elwell acting administrator of the f a a and to deniz mullenberg
[2:14:29.100 --> 2:14:38.220]  cdo of bowing and they'll be available shortly after our conference today they are all in agreement
[2:14:38.220 --> 2:14:43.100]  with the action any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and they're after
[2:14:43.100 --> 2:14:51.180]  be grounded until further notice so planes that are in the air will be grounded if they're the 737
[2:14:51.180 --> 2:14:57.900]  max will be grounded upon landing at the destination let's stop right there the craziness is again
[2:14:57.900 --> 2:15:03.020]  yesterday i and i've got video we just be rolled in for tv viewers i'm literally on the tarmac they
[2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:07.340]  close the door they have this big discussion we stay on the tarmac 30 minutes longer than we're
[2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:13.340]  supposed to and then i start talking to them in the front row to the flight attendants they go well
[2:15:13.340 --> 2:15:17.340]  trump just just announced minutes ago and so we're deciding if we're even going to take off
[2:15:17.340 --> 2:15:20.700]  they were all flustered and the guys like god i wonder if i'm going to get to go to that party
[2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:24.220]  at night in austin so that's that's how i was getting all this inside baseball and then talk to
[2:15:24.220 --> 2:15:28.780]  the pilot because there was like 20 30 minutes of not sure and it was like no no go to your
[2:15:28.780 --> 2:15:35.660]  destination so they kind of took off to austin uh but that's how crazy this has gotten when
[2:15:35.660 --> 2:15:44.380]  the pilots fly the planes trust them and the engineers it's a sensor problem with the autopilot
[2:15:44.380 --> 2:15:48.620]  and that's all that's happening and all you've got to do is tell the pilots especially in third
[2:15:48.620 --> 2:15:54.380]  world countries that don't do their research i guess read the damn manual turn off the freaking
[2:15:54.380 --> 2:16:01.580]  autopilot fly the plane humans remember those people most of you know that heart disease is the

[2:19:43.980 --> 2:19:48.220]  i mean i don't know what's going to happen to me in the future i i mean all i know is i want to go
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:53.420]  with the master built i want to go to the next level i want to be with the spirit that i've
[2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:58.620]  experienced not these devil worshipers they're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb i want
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:00.060]  life i want jesus
[2:20:00.060 --> 2:20:07.020]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:16.460 --> 2:20:20.220]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[2:20:20.220 --> 2:20:29.500]  so i want to get into aoc and some of her crazy behavior that takes the cake so far
[2:20:31.020 --> 2:20:37.340]  we can't snicker too much because there's a very very dark stinking rotting underbelly to this
[2:20:37.340 --> 2:20:41.660]  where those of us that are informed and involved see what a joke she is but for those that aren't
[2:20:41.660 --> 2:20:48.860]  there they're buying the the bs they are buying the baloney big time first off you know i was
[2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:54.140]  reading some of the comments on info wars dot com yesterday in the day on a video report i did
[2:20:54.140 --> 2:20:59.500]  for info wars dot com uh dealing with the fact that president trump really put the exact headline
[2:21:00.460 --> 2:21:08.460]  alex jones trumps portrayal of american rights heartbreaking and then i read the massive amount
[2:21:08.460 --> 2:21:15.100]  of comments and about half of them were saying oh you think you're gonna get arrested like roger stone
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:20.700]  so now you're throwing trump under the bus and the other half were like no trumps a total traitor
[2:21:20.700 --> 2:21:27.820]  snake and jones is right to go after him thank god jones is finally doing it well you're both wrong
[2:21:29.100 --> 2:21:34.540]  trumps pragmatic trumps for america trumps doing a lot of great things but his belief
[2:21:34.540 --> 2:21:39.900]  that he can't go after the racketeering combines of big tech who've been caught red-handed censoring
[2:21:39.900 --> 2:21:44.860]  us and the fact that he's saying he's probably not going to do anything and we all just better
[2:21:46.620 --> 2:21:51.900]  behave ourselves and maybe we'll still be left on the internet that makes me see red
[2:21:53.020 --> 2:21:56.300]  and so talking to people that are close to the president they say listen he's surrounded by
[2:21:56.300 --> 2:22:01.740]  neocons bsing him the only way you get his attention is getting very upset and very angry at him
[2:22:01.740 --> 2:22:07.100]  like tucker carlson and others have done and so that's what i'm doing i thank god every day he's
[2:22:07.100 --> 2:22:13.580]  the president versus hillary clinton but when i watch all the proof of them big tech lying to
[2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:18.700]  congress and i watch all the proof of the censorship and i experience it and i see it
[2:22:18.700 --> 2:22:24.940]  expanding as everybody it makes me get really really really really upset so so no it's not
[2:22:24.940 --> 2:22:29.740]  that trump's a snake in the grass and he's this evil operative out to get us now the globalists
[2:22:29.740 --> 2:22:37.660]  legitimately want him out and it's not that i'm a bad guy now who wants to be left alone by hillary
[2:22:37.660 --> 2:22:44.620]  the deep state so i'm turning against trump that's not what's happening this audience myself all of
[2:22:44.620 --> 2:22:51.260]  you got trump elected we're the americana movement nationalism is exploding worldwide we're the wave
[2:22:51.260 --> 2:22:57.500]  that trump wrote in on and i want trump with his executive power and the president to take action
[2:22:57.500 --> 2:23:04.620]  i love trump but then i really hate some of his actions it's a love hate relationship so
[2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:10.780]  trump's good but if you go read the bright martin interview stop on info wars.com yesterday
[2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:16.540]  maybe i can pull it up today it's already scrolled off but it was something like a headline we'll
[2:23:16.540 --> 2:23:23.740]  try to pull it up trump says be well behaved be really good oh like franklin graham getting taken
[2:23:23.740 --> 2:23:29.420]  off facebook or all the rest of it you know what gets taken off effective truthful well done stuff
[2:23:29.420 --> 2:23:39.740]  like prager university oh can prager who comes off like a school counselor very well spoken very
[2:23:39.740 --> 2:23:46.700]  genteel you can't get more g-rated more friendly more nice more gregarious so can he be better behaved
[2:23:46.700 --> 2:23:55.900]  president day so that's all i'm saying is that it's really starting to get to me and first we
[2:23:55.900 --> 2:23:59.820]  heard about executive orders a year ago and all these actions and then none of those happened
[2:24:01.740 --> 2:24:09.020]  and then we heard well it'll be on the platform for 2020 and now it's not and i'll tell you why
[2:24:09.020 --> 2:24:13.660]  the big and then not that trump's taking lobbyist money he's fired almost all the lobbyists but
[2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:19.020]  still fox news the establishment they see big powerful websites like info wars.com
[2:24:19.020 --> 2:24:27.340]  or drug report.com or daily caller.com bright mart.com they see those as competition to campaign
[2:24:27.340 --> 2:24:31.420]  dollars well i don't take advertising some of the radio stations i'm on the radio network i'm on do
[2:24:31.420 --> 2:24:37.420]  but i don't take money from political advertising in my whole history i think a few times back when
[2:24:37.420 --> 2:24:41.980]  we took advertising a few local candidates for like state rep slip through like oklahoma or
[2:24:41.980 --> 2:24:46.140]  something less than one to the one percent of our money's been political money's my point
[2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:53.580]  for average talk radio upwards of half their money in election years political money so we
[2:24:53.580 --> 2:25:00.860]  don't do that we don't take political money we don't take any of it i mean if our work was a
[2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:05.820]  white tablecloth you might find one little tiny brown spot the size of a freckle where we took
[2:25:05.820 --> 2:25:10.940]  political money and i'm not saying it's bad to take money to run political ads i'm not judging
[2:25:10.940 --> 2:25:16.860]  stations to do that i'm saying that's not who we are but that's the big secret the rest of the story
[2:25:16.860 --> 2:25:23.580]  as paul harvey would say good day it's that the carl roves of the world that bring in hundreds of
[2:25:23.580 --> 2:25:30.220]  millions of dollars in off-ear elections and even more during general elections they wanted all to
[2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:42.540]  Sinclair and all to fox news and all to that we're not even trying to get that money but there are
[2:25:42.540 --> 2:25:48.380]  thousands of packs that are very effective that are raising millions of dollars and that are running
[2:25:48.380 --> 2:25:53.660]  ads and that are effective and that scares the old not that old people are bad but in this case
[2:25:53.660 --> 2:25:58.700]  they're old thinking old political establishment so there's a perfect storm of dying corporate
[2:25:58.700 --> 2:26:04.140]  meeting dying leftist media authoritarian colleges that are so corrupt with worthless degrees collapsing
[2:26:05.260 --> 2:26:08.860]  governments that are corrupt and collapsing not just here but all the world
[2:26:09.420 --> 2:26:16.700]  china financing anti-free speech movements and they don't know what to do they don't know how
[2:26:16.700 --> 2:26:24.460]  to respond and so they just say shut it all down and the final little ingredient is the pr firms
[2:26:24.460 --> 2:26:31.420]  the lobbyists the ad agencies that make buh buh buh buh buh billions about four billion on a general
[2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:37.580]  election about two billion on an off-ear election and they're making all that money and the mere fact
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:44.060]  that it embarrasses them that grassroots websites and grassroots talk shows will have viral videos
[2:26:44.060 --> 2:26:49.340]  not that we even put out everybody puts them out you'll go look at the top 10 viral videos during
[2:26:49.340 --> 2:26:56.380]  an election and nine of them are mom and pop packs or groups that aren't even packs and that's why
[2:26:57.500 --> 2:27:02.460]  that's why they want everybody shut down and that's why they say drudge report info wars
[2:27:02.460 --> 2:27:07.020]  are political in the federal elections commission because when we say we're pro gun or we're pro
[2:27:07.020 --> 2:27:13.740]  life or we support president trump or we support this congressman or this congresswoman they know
[2:27:13.740 --> 2:27:18.620]  that's politically getting them elected it's not political money it's not even political speech it's
[2:27:18.620 --> 2:27:26.220]  our free speech but they're trying to convolut all of that together to then shut us down so the
[2:27:26.220 --> 2:27:31.660]  final equation is fox news and all these people they don't want political competition they want to
[2:27:31.660 --> 2:27:36.620]  be the only game in town and they'd rather trump lose the election or america go down the tubes if
[2:27:36.620 --> 2:27:43.580]  they can ride us going down for another decade and it it really is treason it really is disgusting and
[2:27:43.580 --> 2:27:50.780]  so whether trump's getting bad advice uh or whether he's been compromised whatever the case is the
[2:27:50.780 --> 2:27:58.620]  biggest sterling issue even bigger than the border is free speech in this country and the fact that
[2:27:58.620 --> 2:28:05.020]  president trump is dead in the water letting a twist to the wind and basically said i'm not coming
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:11.820]  to your aid get used to it green light facebook green light google green light twitter green light
[2:28:11.820 --> 2:28:17.900]  youtube green light everybody you shut down whoever you want and you do it you organize
[2:28:17.900 --> 2:28:23.020]  yourselves and you lie to congress and i'm not going to do a damn thing sure he says in the
[2:28:23.020 --> 2:28:31.100]  interview they're doing it they lied but you know what bend over and enjoy it and behave yourself
[2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:35.500]  with stocco syndrome maybe we'll leave you alone that really freaks me out and so i'm saying put
[2:28:35.500 --> 2:28:43.100]  pressure on trump as citizen activist as citizen lobbyist for free speech to stop it and say no
[2:28:43.740 --> 2:28:48.620]  you try red flag laws to take our guns lovely process that's a done deal too
[2:28:48.620 --> 2:28:54.620]  trump needs to know hey listen here you're not our pimp we're not your hose we don't just do

[2:33:17.820 --> 2:33:25.660]  resistance to tyrants his obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:37.100]  show while we laugh at the evil obviously demonically possessed archives of the
[2:33:37.980 --> 2:33:41.100]  what i believe is methamphetamine addict aoc
[2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:47.980]  oh we laugh remember our schoolchildren in accredited private schools and public schools
[2:33:48.700 --> 2:33:55.900]  in about 78 percent of schools in the u.s are being taught exactly what aoc is spewing
[2:33:56.940 --> 2:34:01.820]  so we can sit there and laugh at her as an extremist but the communists the socialists
[2:34:01.820 --> 2:34:06.300]  have killed 200 plus million people the last century a good 10 million plus people this
[2:34:06.300 --> 2:34:14.540]  century and they mean business so when you hear her say capitalism is irredeemable that's a quote
[2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:19.100]  or america's garbage we're gonna play this quote you're thinking well this is insanity
[2:34:20.060 --> 2:34:25.580]  well sure she's a low IQ probably 75 IQ clearly in my view drug addict
[2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:31.660]  methad puppet will be thrown away later but it's her job to introduce all these poisonous
[2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:39.340]  carcinogen laced lies to the public because you've got all these big polls another one came out
[2:34:39.340 --> 2:34:44.860]  earlier this week but you've got gallup polls and others all saying between 49 and 55 percent
[2:34:44.860 --> 2:34:52.220]  depending on a poll but roughly half of millenials and generation z so that's people under about
[2:34:52.220 --> 2:34:59.020]  33 34 they want communism or socialism they believe in a free lunch now sure the system we have is
[2:34:59.020 --> 2:35:04.860]  crony capitalism and combines and groups rigging things but they're rigging and siphoning off a big
[2:35:04.860 --> 2:35:10.700]  powerful free market juggernaut and they're weakening it but still it's light years better
[2:35:10.700 --> 2:35:18.620]  obviously than communism or socialism take our once great medicine the 1960s we had the very
[2:35:18.620 --> 2:35:22.620]  best medicine in the world then we made it mandatory put government spending behind it
[2:35:22.620 --> 2:35:29.340]  balloon the amount of cost and now it's falling apart it's the same thing with education it was
[2:35:29.340 --> 2:35:34.380]  so the best education in the world but then all of these corporate groups and hospital groups got
[2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:39.020]  behind subsidizing health care they put more money behind it for about prices lowered quality
[2:35:39.980 --> 2:35:46.220]  so it's the same story over and over again and sure you've got the clearly elected president
[2:35:46.220 --> 2:35:53.020]  of venezuela inviting her down she said hell no i'm not coming down there because while the
[2:35:53.020 --> 2:35:57.660]  average venezuela and fights for their life to eat garbage it's eat garbage or die in socialist
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:01.820]  countries you eat garbage or die she knows she's part of the ruling elite wearing three thousand
[2:36:01.820 --> 2:36:07.100]  five thousand dollar outfits thousand dollar shoes flying around in helicopters and private jets
[2:36:07.100 --> 2:36:13.740]  driving you know a hundred thousand dollar suvs that's for you to not have a car that's for you
[2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:17.580]  to not have air conditioning like when obama went to africa and said you can't have cars
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:22.540]  you can't have air conditioning that that's for you not for him he's part of the ruling class
[2:36:23.980 --> 2:36:27.820]  so i wanted to play some of these clips and remember they all dovetail
[2:36:30.060 --> 2:36:36.540]  with people like governor qualmo new york saying america was never great and will ever be that great
[2:36:37.660 --> 2:36:42.700]  because they're conquering america they don't want it to succeed they want it to fail
[2:36:42.700 --> 2:36:47.900]  because they want to loot it it's elementary my dear watson and look i know you know that you're
[2:36:47.900 --> 2:36:53.580]  laughing at her but don't laugh because she's winning because you're not involved in the schools
[2:36:53.580 --> 2:36:58.380]  i'm not involved in the schools we're not out there upfront saying no to these monsters we're
[2:36:58.380 --> 2:37:03.260]  letting wild-eyed demons run our lives so what does it say about us if she's so weak if she's so
[2:37:03.260 --> 2:37:10.140]  laughable if she's so pathetic then who are we well we're the slave of aoc we're aoc's bitch
[2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:18.700]  she's our pill so here's aoc in austin just a few days ago calling america garbage well then get
[2:37:18.700 --> 2:37:25.900]  the hell out sister here it is i think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are
[2:37:25.900 --> 2:37:32.620]  but where we are is not a good thing and this idea of like 10 percent better from garbage
[2:37:32.620 --> 2:37:42.620]  it shouldn't be what we settle for it's like this like it feels like moderate is not a stance it's
[2:37:42.620 --> 2:37:51.340]  just an attitude toward life of like don't hold back tell me how you really feel about incrementalism
[2:37:52.780 --> 2:38:00.620]  but so america's garbage on a trajectory and since socialism took over it's been going down
[2:38:00.620 --> 2:38:05.660]  but but she's claiming everybody wants to get here because we're garbage and clearly she looks
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:10.540]  like she's on hardcore drugs if you're a radio listener you don't see it i mean she is circling
[2:38:10.540 --> 2:38:15.020]  the toilet bowl fast uh you know she's committed all these federal elections commission crimes
[2:38:15.020 --> 2:38:21.100]  stolen millions cut and drive but hey don't hold your breath though remember Pelosi can engage in
[2:38:21.100 --> 2:38:26.460]  crime maxine waters can engage in crime hillary can ever foundation still billions it's okay
[2:38:26.460 --> 2:38:31.980]  because the justice department works for them look at all the stock testimony all the page
[2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:36.620]  testimony that's come out proving everything that was all a witch on all political but it's not getting
[2:38:36.620 --> 2:38:41.900]  any coverage except for info wars dot com and news wars dot com which is why they want to shut down
[2:38:41.900 --> 2:38:45.740]  and then the president won't defend us he says hey be censored learn to bend over and have your
[2:38:45.740 --> 2:38:51.340]  rights taken i don't want the internet defending me okay trump great whatever god what a nightmare
[2:38:51.340 --> 2:38:58.300]  unbelievable uh so here's another one aoc slams capitalism let's listen to this jewel and the
[2:38:58.300 --> 2:39:07.100]  really big one's coming up the tough part about this about like is capitalism redeemable etc
[2:39:07.660 --> 2:39:13.420]  is that uh it's hard to have these conversations i think as a society because we all have different
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:21.340]  ideas of what just in the public imagination there's a there are different ideas of what
[2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:29.580]  does capitalism mean what does socialism mean etc but for me when i think about
[2:39:30.700 --> 2:39:39.260]  what those definitions are capitalism isn't to me is it's an ideology of capital it puts capital
[2:39:39.260 --> 2:39:48.460]  the most important thing is the concentration of capital and it means that we seek and prioritize
[2:39:48.460 --> 2:39:56.460]  profit and the accumulation of money above all else and we seek it at any human and environmental
[2:39:56.460 --> 2:40:03.420]  cost that is what that means and to me that ideology is not sustainable and cannot be redeemed
[2:40:03.420 --> 2:40:10.300]  no that's not what quote capitalism is meanwhile you have these crony fascist systems that work
[2:40:10.300 --> 2:40:14.140]  with the communists and others that ruin the environment like no other and you'll never hear
[2:40:14.140 --> 2:40:20.140]  her criticize china you'll never hear her criticize venezuela they're the most exploitive ribs in the
[2:40:20.140 --> 2:40:26.140]  world now here's an incredible exchange she reaches next level dumbness when she's talking
[2:40:27.260 --> 2:40:33.340]  to the head of wells fargo and blaming them for loans they give people so if i loan you money
[2:40:33.340 --> 2:40:38.300]  for a truck and you run somebody over it's my fault this is just next level house he's extending
[2:40:38.300 --> 2:40:44.700]  guilt to everyone but her everyone's guilty but her here it is why was the bank involved in the
[2:40:44.700 --> 2:40:50.620]  caging of children and financing the caging of children to begin with uh i i don't know how
[2:40:50.620 --> 2:40:58.300]  do they answer that question because we weren't uh so in finance you you were financing and involved
[2:40:58.300 --> 2:41:03.180]  in debt financing of course civic and geo group correct for a for a period of time we were involved in
[2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:08.380]  financing one of the firms were not anymore and the other i'm not familiar with the specific
[2:41:09.500 --> 2:41:13.500]  assertion that you're making but we weren't directly involved in that okay so these companies
[2:41:13.500 --> 2:41:19.820]  run private detention facilities run by ice which uh which is involved in in caging children but
[2:41:19.820 --> 2:41:27.180]  i'll i'll move on uh mr slone uh wells fargo was all over the major back it up because we're going
[2:41:27.180 --> 2:41:33.260]  to go to next segment with us you just heard wells fargo has been involved financing u.s
[2:41:33.260 --> 2:41:38.220]  government projects where they use private contractors to build emergency centers for the

[2:47:28.780 --> 2:47:42.860]  you ever noticed that hillary clinton michael moore nancy polosi maxine waters joe biden
[2:47:44.380 --> 2:47:49.660]  all the usual suspects george soros they're never worried about pipelines in china
[2:47:50.860 --> 2:47:55.580]  they're never worried about pipelines in the middle east never worried about pipelines in africa to
[2:47:55.580 --> 2:48:02.380]  the chikam ships never worried about mexican pipelines or argentinian pipelines or south african
[2:48:02.380 --> 2:48:07.980]  pipelines or russian pipelines well that's not true that she went over the russians roundable
[2:48:07.980 --> 2:48:15.500]  pipelines to europe they don't want canada with all its oil and all its cash bringing in that
[2:48:15.500 --> 2:48:22.300]  energy instead of it coming out of saudi arabia at half the cost to americans the average canadian
[2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:27.900]  oil and gas comes in around half the price and free marketers are like hey let's go around prices
[2:48:27.900 --> 2:48:34.860]  let's be energy competitive and america's not worried about cheap canadian oil and gas but she
[2:48:35.980 --> 2:48:41.580]  warren buffett and david rockefeller before he died and if you look it up people like
[2:48:41.580 --> 2:48:48.140]  george soros they control the trains that take the oil and gas out of canada and most of it goes
[2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:55.340]  to canada's west coast and is loaded on super tankers and taken to china and japan
[2:48:57.740 --> 2:48:59.100]  so see they don't want
[2:49:01.580 --> 2:49:07.100]  canada to start trans shipping out of the gulf of mexico to all of the world including europe
[2:49:08.220 --> 2:49:12.860]  because you can go through the gulf to the atlantic just as quickly to europe as you can
[2:49:12.860 --> 2:49:18.780]  go across to asia and if you go look at the congressional battles what really goes on it's
[2:49:18.780 --> 2:49:24.780]  all about canada selling us cheap oil and gas that we add to what we're producing in texas
[2:49:25.420 --> 2:49:29.020]  more than saudi arabia now by the way the united states is more in saudi arabia we're now the
[2:49:29.020 --> 2:49:33.980]  energy leader it's about teaming up with canada and dominating the world selling the cheapest
[2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:42.300]  oil and gas which by the way totally screws russia so what trump's been doing is very pro america
[2:49:42.300 --> 2:49:49.100]  and very aggressive i think that makes old pootie poot happy but the democrats and others they've
[2:49:49.100 --> 2:49:53.980]  got that deal they are trying to stop four different pipelines coming down from canada in the united
[2:49:53.980 --> 2:49:59.180]  those pipelines are totally safe compared to anything else out there but they don't want
[2:49:59.180 --> 2:50:05.020]  the arctic refuge that trump just opened up it's got more oil than saudi arabia on record
[2:50:05.020 --> 2:50:12.780]  and it's sweet crude super clean burning what do you think does all these anti oil movies
[2:50:12.780 --> 2:50:18.300]  in the u.s the saudi's nothing against the saudi's okay great we're gonna produce our own oil we're
[2:50:18.300 --> 2:50:23.580]  gonna work with canada they're trying to block it so let me go back to aoc aoc is busy blaming
[2:50:23.580 --> 2:50:29.660]  well as far ago when when when private companies get the contracts to build ice emergency centers
[2:50:29.660 --> 2:50:33.900]  it's a year two three year contract the government doesn't just give a contract for all the money
[2:50:33.900 --> 2:50:39.180]  they'd be idiots if they did you've been any of you did you have a contractor 20 up front for the
[2:50:39.180 --> 2:50:43.340]  material once they go through projects in your contract usually in thirds you pay them off if
[2:50:43.340 --> 2:50:51.260]  you're smart she's pissed that well fargo gives contractors money who get us contracts to build
[2:50:51.260 --> 2:51:00.060]  their facilities then she segues only like a o she can do and adjust how evil it is that they're
[2:51:00.060 --> 2:51:07.020]  involved financing gas and oil pipelines in north america imagine the evil this woman's house is
[2:51:07.020 --> 2:51:13.020]  heated with it she drives around in suv she flies around on private jets she swendles millions from
[2:51:13.020 --> 2:51:20.620]  people she lives like a freaking king and she's gonna tell you how bad america is having infrastructure
[2:51:20.620 --> 2:51:28.540]  because globalism is about deindustrializing north america and for all trumps crimes and tying his
[2:51:28.540 --> 2:51:33.660]  hands behind his back and ours with allowing the censorship he's light years better than hillary
[2:51:34.300 --> 2:51:39.740]  but that doesn't mean i'm not gonna come after him i don't know it's kind of like your wife you
[2:51:39.740 --> 2:51:43.580]  love him to death but if you catch him cheating on you're gonna get really upset right i mean i
[2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:48.140]  don't know what the hell trumps doing i can't we should whole show just asking what do you think
[2:51:48.140 --> 2:51:56.460]  he's doing what do we do sorry sorry i'm they're now making rumblings about red flag laws where
[2:51:56.460 --> 2:52:01.260]  there's no law they can just take your guns with no law i mean i'm gonna divorce trump at that point
[2:52:01.260 --> 2:52:06.220]  aren't you i don't want it to happen i'm like hey gee don't punch me in the nose or i'm gonna punch
[2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:11.660]  you back it's it's not like i'm looking for trouble here i'm digressing can we go to the real problem
[2:52:11.660 --> 2:52:20.300]  aoc here it is uh so in finance you you were financing involved in that financing of course
[2:52:20.300 --> 2:52:25.660]  civic and geo group correct for a period of time we were involved in financing one of the firms were
[2:52:25.660 --> 2:52:31.740]  not anymore and the other i'm not familiar with the specific uh assertion that you're making but
[2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:37.100]  we weren't directly involved in that okay so these companies run private detention facilities run by
[2:52:37.100 --> 2:52:43.980]  ice which uh which is involved in in caging children but i'll i'll move on uh mr. slone uh well
[2:52:43.980 --> 2:52:49.100]  spargo was also again yeah they finance them and their private facilities is cheaper but their
[2:52:49.100 --> 2:52:56.620]  staff with federal agents again let's continue mr. slone uh well spargo was also an investor
[2:52:56.620 --> 2:53:02.460]  the major investor in the dakota access pipeline the keystone xl pipelines uh they were prime investors
[2:53:02.460 --> 2:53:08.060]  and lenders to companies building these pipelines in defiance of standing rock sues treaty rights to
[2:53:08.060 --> 2:53:13.740]  protect its water and sacred lands uh they warned early on the Lakota sue warned early on that the
[2:53:13.740 --> 2:53:20.540]  pipeline was unstable and bound to leak despite that it was built anyway and it has leaked at least
[2:53:20.540 --> 2:53:27.340]  five times and the keystone xl in particular by the way if they're doing a repair job on a piece of
[2:53:27.340 --> 2:53:32.300]  pipe and two drops at the ground they got a fill a report out the two drops of oil hit the ground
[2:53:32.300 --> 2:53:40.540]  i mean this is a literal joke continue the keystone xl in particular had one leak that leaked 210
[2:53:40.540 --> 2:53:49.580]  thousand gallons across south dakota uh since wells fargo financed the building of this pipeline in an
[2:53:49.580 --> 2:53:56.620]  and in an environmentally unstable way uh why shouldn't the bank be held responsible for
[2:53:56.620 --> 2:54:02.140]  financing the cleanup of the of the disasters from these projects uh which pipeline are you referring
[2:54:02.140 --> 2:54:10.140]  to um either we know so we were not involved in the financing of the x of the xl pipeline oh and back it up
[2:54:10.140 --> 2:54:17.660]  seriously she doesn't even know what she's talking about i remember that came out there was the
[2:54:17.660 --> 2:54:22.780]  potential that that much was being sent to the line when it happened it turned out it was a media
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:26.380]  hoax thousands of gallons were not released that's that's what i'm talking about it's just
[2:54:26.380 --> 2:54:32.700]  just plus none of this is perfect this is an industrial world lady say something about china
[2:54:32.700 --> 2:54:38.940]  you you meth witch it's just where their rivers light on fire and they have human animal clones
[2:54:38.940 --> 2:54:44.220]  and that were mask and they have no environmental standards but no you just keep bitching and
[2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:49.100]  bitching because it's your job to stop this country because you're an anti-american person
[2:54:49.100 --> 2:54:56.700]  that said our country is garbage no you are a bug-eyed demon witch you look like a meth head
[2:54:57.660 --> 2:55:04.540]  you look like a crack whore but you're the new congresswoman Somali's that hate americans and
[2:55:04.540 --> 2:55:11.180]  you and we're supposed to bend over and bow i'm not bowing you you meth snorting monster
[2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:18.780]  sorry let's go back to her which pipeline are you referring to um either we know so we we were
[2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:25.260]  not involved in the financing of the x of the xl pipeline we were one of the 17 or 19 banks that
[2:55:25.260 --> 2:55:31.980]  was involved in the financing of the dakota access pipeline okay so uh so wells fargo hasn't financed
[2:55:31.980 --> 2:55:37.100]  any company associated with the keystone xl pipeline no i didn't say that i said we're not
[2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:43.820]  involved in financing that pipeline specifically okay so let's focus on the dakota access pipeline
[2:55:43.820 --> 2:55:48.460]  should wells fargo be held responsible for the damages incurred by climate change due to the
[2:55:48.460 --> 2:55:54.620]  financing of fossil fuels and and these projects i i don't know how you'd calculate that congresswoman
[2:55:54.620 --> 2:56:01.660]  say from spills or when we have to reinvest in infrastructure building c walls from the erosion
[2:56:01.660 --> 2:56:09.180]  of um from the erosion of infrastructure or cleanups wildfires etc related to that pipeline
[2:56:09.180 --> 2:56:13.980]  i'm not aware that there's been any of what you described that's occurred how about there's no
[2:56:13.980 --> 2:56:21.020]  cleanups there's no coastline in the dakota's i'm telling you let's just continue dakota access
[2:56:21.020 --> 2:56:26.940]  pipeline i'm not aware of the leaks associated with the dakota access pipeline uh that you're
[2:56:26.940 --> 2:56:33.020]  describing so hypothetically if there was a leak from the dakota access pipeline uh why shouldn't
[2:56:33.020 --> 2:56:37.820]  wells fargo pay for the cleanup of it if since it paid for the construction of the pipeline itself
[2:56:37.820 --> 2:56:43.020]  because we don't operate the pipeline we provide financing to the company that's operating the
[2:56:43.020 --> 2:56:50.140]  pipeline our responsibility is to ensure that at the time that we make that loan that that customer
[2:56:50.140 --> 2:56:55.580]  and we have a group of people in wells fargo including an environmental oversight group
[2:56:55.580 --> 2:57:00.380]  headed by one of my colleagues who used to try to pause i have to point out the particular one
[2:57:00.380 --> 2:57:04.940]  we're talking about hasn't been built yet that's what i'm saying she's she's announcing oil pipeline
[2:57:04.940 --> 2:57:13.100]  spells it didn't take place let's continue so one question why did wells fargo finance this pipeline
[2:57:13.100 --> 2:57:19.420]  when it was widely seen to be environmentally unstable uh again the reason that we were one of
[2:57:19.420 --> 2:57:26.460]  the 17 or 19 banks that financed that is because our team reviewed the environmental impact and
[2:57:26.460 --> 2:57:33.500]  we concluded that it was it was a risk that we were willing to take uh yeah because they just say
[2:57:33.500 --> 2:57:40.780]  we can't have pipelines for everybody else too i mean it's just insane we'll be back with a fourth
[2:57:40.780 --> 2:57:46.620]  hour i know it's young tomorrow's news today info wars dot com the dreaded beacon of truth

[3:00:12.380 --> 3:00:22.540]  day of march 2019 a girl's self-show you know some people have mistaken this broadcast for a cult
[3:00:22.540 --> 3:00:27.740]  i'm not a democrat i'm not a republican hack democrats follow with hillary clinton and
[3:00:27.740 --> 3:00:33.260]  ancy polosi and people like that say uh establishment republicans do with carl rove says
[3:00:34.700 --> 3:00:40.300]  i'm back president trump because he supported the idea of the president being the president
[3:00:40.300 --> 3:00:45.740]  and national sovereignty being run out of the country and all the states and he's done that
[3:00:45.740 --> 3:00:51.580]  he's he's an american president he's actually running stuff and it's pissing the establishment off
[3:00:51.580 --> 3:00:56.700]  now that doesn't mean that i'm not angry about some of the things trumps been doing and i'm
[3:00:56.700 --> 3:01:01.100]  going to tell you about it because i'm not the cult i'm not the donald john trump cult i'm not
[3:01:01.100 --> 3:01:05.820]  the hillary rodham cult uh i'll tell you people always say you know or have you sold out you
[3:01:05.820 --> 3:01:12.140]  guys sold out to jesus christ i did it's true it's already been done and i sold out of the truth
[3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:18.700]  and justice and uh it feels good to be sold like i'm signed on like there's there's there's no
[3:01:18.700 --> 3:01:25.820]  going to go down that road but i continually forget on here as i bitch and complain about
[3:01:25.820 --> 3:01:30.300]  funding the running operations that when i plug consistently two three times an hour
[3:01:30.300 --> 3:01:34.700]  you bring in the funds and not just continue against all the attacks which are sustained and
[3:01:34.700 --> 3:01:41.260]  ongoing but we prevail over them so let me just thank the listeners that have gotten great products
[3:01:41.260 --> 3:01:47.100]  from the store and supported us and encourage others there's a trillion voices out there because
[3:01:47.100 --> 3:01:50.940]  there's seven and a half billion people and there's millions and millions of talk show hosts and
[3:01:50.940 --> 3:01:54.940]  voices online and they make thousands of comments a day and that's billions a day and that's
[3:01:54.940 --> 3:02:02.220]  trillions every you know month there are trillions of things being said but what we say particularly
[3:02:02.220 --> 3:02:09.020]  like you got a piece of quartz doesn't hurt superman got a piece of lead doesn't hurt superman
[3:02:09.740 --> 3:02:14.300]  got a piece of crystal doesn't hurt superman got a paper cup doesn't hurt superman
[3:02:16.620 --> 3:02:21.500]  info or superman starts shriveling up and dying and we're not fighting a good man of steel we're
[3:02:21.500 --> 3:02:27.820]  fighting the diabolo and let me tell you just like garlic metaphysically metaphorically historically
[3:02:27.820 --> 3:02:33.340]  archetypally vampires don't like high noon they don't like silver bullets they don't like holy
[3:02:33.340 --> 3:02:39.260]  water they don't like garlic what's garlic do it wards off disease it cleanses the blood of evil
[3:02:39.900 --> 3:02:46.380]  holy water metaphysically water blessed by god the sun you know giving life to the earth and
[3:02:46.380 --> 3:02:51.980]  clarity and vision silver anti-poison as well to the vampire and the werewolf
[3:02:51.980 --> 3:03:00.460]  these are archetypes but info wars is beyond an archetype it's a real system in the 21st century
[3:03:01.260 --> 3:03:06.380]  that is proven and that has gone through the wars and that has paid the price and that has been
[3:03:06.380 --> 3:03:12.940]  persecuted and that has been uh proven to to be dedicated to war against the devil
[3:03:14.620 --> 3:03:19.020]  and that doesn't mean i'm some sanctimonious fake priest when i'm so good and then i'm
[3:03:19.020 --> 3:03:25.820]  diddling some kid in the back i'm a sinner and i'm full of life and i've tasted a lot of things
[3:03:25.820 --> 3:03:32.540]  let me tell you something i've tasted god and that's where i want to go but to get there we need a
[3:03:32.540 --> 3:03:38.380]  group of people of every race color and creed i call myself white but you know i'm really

[3:06:05.660 --> 3:06:21.500]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:06:24.540 --> 3:06:31.020]  okay i don't know where to begin but um alex always leaves me with some red meat on the table
[3:06:31.020 --> 3:06:36.940]  and while i'm making my notes i usually go back to shake that meat a little bit more and put my
[3:06:36.940 --> 3:06:43.580]  put my own teeth into it you know i'm i'm thinking about the alit the aoc or as um mark
[3:06:43.580 --> 3:06:51.420]  levin calls her aoc because it sounds so creepy aoc or just call her cortex giving somebody a hyphenated
[3:06:51.420 --> 3:06:59.020]  name that's just you know playing playing their naming i call her cortex or aoc but i like aoc
[3:06:59.020 --> 3:07:05.740]  sounds like a space alien a lizard you know it's important to recognize that she didn't come from
[3:07:05.740 --> 3:07:15.820]  nowhere aoc literally won a commie casting call there are democrat rascputans or you know socialist
[3:07:15.820 --> 3:07:21.980]  actually democrat socialist rascputans behind her who are old and ugly and white okay basically
[3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:28.860]  and they realized they can't find an easy an easy seat with a vulnerable uh you know a vulnerable
[3:07:28.860 --> 3:07:36.300]  democrat uh representative so they literally held a commie casting call wouldn't you love to see the
[3:07:36.300 --> 3:07:42.700]  other the other submissions you know like sending in your audition video uh to survive her or some
[3:07:42.700 --> 3:07:50.060]  you know reality tv show so aoc had the bubbly you know the bubbly voice and big eyes and and
[3:07:50.060 --> 3:07:56.300]  basically she's she's basically just a mannequin for the uh you know for the rascputans behind her
[3:07:56.860 --> 3:08:02.220]  and you could tell it when she was when she was um interviewing the wells fargo executive yesterday
[3:08:02.860 --> 3:08:08.940]  she had no follow-ups she was reading notes that one of her rascputans wrote for her but she when
[3:08:08.940 --> 3:08:14.860]  he said nope we didn't do that she was absolutely just stymied okay well then let's move on to
[3:08:14.860 --> 3:08:20.380]  another area where i've been handed a note by my handlers so this is where we are
[3:08:21.260 --> 3:08:28.540]  the probably the most recognizable leading energetic young congress congressperson
[3:08:29.500 --> 3:08:36.460]  won a commie casting call which is like uh looking you know music producers looking for the right face
[3:08:37.020 --> 3:08:42.620]  to become the next pop star and it doesn't matter if they can sing or not because with today's
[3:08:42.620 --> 3:08:49.980]  with today's uh audio and computer magic they can they can digitally harmonize anybody to
[3:08:49.980 --> 3:08:56.860]  sounding all right so she's literally just a face but what this tells us is that our country is in
[3:08:56.860 --> 3:09:05.020]  deep deep trouble because it's working to the morons that support her she is literally the
[3:09:05.020 --> 3:09:11.820]  second coming green new deal 30 trillion dollars who cares that's just numbers so we're we've gone
[3:09:11.820 --> 3:09:19.260]  beyond the enlightenment and rational thought into the area of enumeracy it's a word like illiteracy
[3:09:19.260 --> 3:09:25.340]  there are probably half of the country can't understand compound interest for example so
[3:09:25.980 --> 3:09:31.660]  if somebody says three billion or 30 trillion literally it means nothing to them any different
[3:09:31.660 --> 3:09:37.180]  so they have no way of knowing well wait a minute this is impossible it's going to crash the economy
[3:09:37.180 --> 3:09:43.740]  well that's the plan you crash the economy then you have a ready scapegoat which will be old white
[3:09:43.740 --> 3:09:50.780]  christian men primarily guys like me that will be blamed so this has been seen over and over again
[3:09:50.780 --> 3:09:55.420]  going back to the jackabins and the french revolution the bolsheviks it's a tried and
[3:09:55.420 --> 3:10:02.940]  true method wreck the economy blame your enemies which are the you know the the religious orders
[3:10:02.940 --> 3:10:09.740]  in france during the revolution or the kulak farmers in russia wipe them out so they can never
[3:10:09.740 --> 3:10:16.540]  come back you do scorched earth on your enemies of course what these bolsheviks are too stupid to
[3:10:16.540 --> 3:10:22.780]  realize is that as long as we have the second amendment the best they can do is trigger a civil
[3:10:22.780 --> 3:10:29.260]  war that i think they'll lose big time in history the communists have lost a couple times and it's
[3:10:29.260 --> 3:10:34.780]  and then they get wiped out too so if they if they come for us you know like like wolves on sheep
[3:10:34.780 --> 3:10:40.300]  we'll have no choice to go sheepdog on them and that has happened in history the commies do not
[3:10:40.300 --> 3:10:46.300]  always win you know when when people talk about switzerland's own version of the second amendment
[3:10:46.300 --> 3:10:52.380]  with every every man doing military service and then taking his modern battle rifle home
[3:10:52.380 --> 3:10:57.660]  they always point out yeah you know switzerland's never been invaded by a foreign enemy true they've
[3:10:57.660 --> 3:11:03.660]  also never had their own tyrant a tyrant would never get to the place where he could confiscate
[3:11:03.660 --> 3:11:09.660]  the weapons from the swiss so switzerland has been a free country because its citizens are armed and
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:17.580]  would not put up with a tyrant no way no how but now when we've got such a stupid country really the
[3:11:17.580 --> 3:11:23.660]  i call these the dunning kruger democrats people that are you know low iq they're easily manipulated
[3:11:23.660 --> 3:11:29.020]  this is why they want more and more flooding in from the third world the lower the iq the better
[3:11:29.020 --> 3:11:33.580]  if they can't speak english that's great they'll need democrat social workers translators everything
[3:11:33.580 --> 3:11:40.380]  else so where you have a chance to make it and make an impact on your family that aren't quite
[3:11:40.380 --> 3:11:45.820]  up to speed they kind of get that something's wrong they don't understand population replacement
[3:11:45.820 --> 3:11:53.420]  what it really means but if these concepts are really key very key open borders why are the
[3:11:53.420 --> 3:11:59.340]  democrats so adamant about open borders they'll let fentanyl flood in they'll let murderers come
[3:11:59.340 --> 3:12:06.940]  in be arrested nine times like the last case men murder an american the the democrats do not care
[3:12:06.940 --> 3:12:14.060]  about the drugs the human sex slave trafficking all they care about is getting future democrat
[3:12:14.060 --> 3:12:20.300]  voters this is cloward piven on steroids cloward piven these were two sociologists that came up
[3:12:20.300 --> 3:12:27.180]  with the strategy to overwhelm america by flooding it with illegals wrecking the family causing more
[3:12:27.180 --> 3:12:32.140]  and more people to be government dependent until the system would be overwhelmed this is also the
[3:12:32.140 --> 3:12:37.340]  point of what they now call single payer health care that the government will be in charge of
[3:12:37.340 --> 3:12:45.260]  every aspect of your life and to morons it's very appealing so if you combine open borders
[3:12:45.260 --> 3:12:51.260]  and cloward piven which is a moron population of voters with what were excuse me cloward piven is
[3:12:51.260 --> 3:12:56.140]  the is flooding the country then dunning kruger the morons and then you you're willing to use
[3:12:56.140 --> 3:13:03.340]  elinsky tactics remember sol elinsky learned his tricks from studying the chicago mob so elinsky
[3:13:03.340 --> 3:13:09.740]  tactics are basically distilled down their mafia tactics it means you'll do anything that it takes
[3:13:09.740 --> 3:13:17.580]  to win you'll lie cheat steel bribe spread false rumors about people that's that's elinsky so
[3:13:18.620 --> 3:13:24.780]  together what these concepts point to we have a ready example in california and increasingly
[3:13:24.780 --> 3:13:31.020]  in many other states california went from you know from reagan and pete wilson and prop 187
[3:13:31.020 --> 3:13:38.300]  to becoming a democrat supermajority this means there's no influence that the gop has because
[3:13:38.300 --> 3:13:44.860]  of just extreme radical gerrymandering republicans have no influence in the california legislature
[3:13:44.860 --> 3:13:52.220]  or executive zero it's being run now like venezuela it's it's and it is the plan for all
[3:13:52.220 --> 3:13:57.500]  50 states if you look at california and you say well it sucks to be them i wouldn't want to live
[3:13:57.500 --> 3:14:04.780]  there thank god i live in wyoming or tennessee well let me tell you brother when texas end or
[3:14:04.780 --> 3:14:12.140]  florida flip in 2020 that is all she wrote the calla zewella plan is going to be rammed down
[3:14:12.140 --> 3:14:18.060]  our throats and it won't matter if you live in wyoming or tennessee or any other red state currently
[3:14:18.620 --> 3:14:23.820]  they are going to control the whole board the way that they do in california the republicans will
[3:14:23.820 --> 3:14:29.980]  be sidelined they'll have no power no impact and i'm not saying this will lead then to gun
[3:14:29.980 --> 3:14:35.980]  gun confiscation and uh uh you know some kind of a bolshevik revolution what it's going to
[3:14:35.980 --> 3:14:44.060]  lead to though is a civil war absolutely for a fact and our adversaries are just too stupid
[3:14:44.060 --> 3:14:49.900]  to realize this and it's not only happening right now in america with this calla zewella plan
[3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:57.340]  it's happening in the uk you can see where the brexit deal the the elites including uh
[3:14:57.340 --> 3:15:02.460]  teresa may and all the rest the elites are selling out the people they're supposed to
[3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:08.940]  be on march 29th if there's no deal a hard brexit well this is once again with the eu they vote
[3:15:08.940 --> 3:15:14.460]  until the eu gets the result that it wants and it can't ever be accepted that britain is going to
[3:15:14.460 --> 3:15:20.860]  leave in france you've still got the yellow vest protests going on where the police are are you
[3:15:20.860 --> 3:15:26.140]  doing everything short of lethal force blowing off hands uh blinding people with exploding
[3:15:26.140 --> 3:15:30.860]  grenades that hit them in the face that are aimed at the face so this is not just a phenomenon in
[3:15:30.860 --> 3:15:37.260]  america we thought with trump winning and with the brexit vote that the tide was going to turn
[3:15:37.260 --> 3:15:43.500]  but the communists are not going down without a fight and it's going to take a fight to keep
[3:15:43.500 --> 3:15:49.980]  this country free and hopefully to maybe someday make europe free and uh when the other side of
[3:15:49.980 --> 3:15:56.300]  the break we'll come back and uh and i'm going to talk about some other uh social media subjects
[3:15:56.300 --> 3:16:00.780]  and maybe we'll get the phones later you know hunters anglers campers and survivalists get back

[3:19:55.020 --> 3:20:07.820]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:25.660 --> 3:20:35.340]  okay just finishing up a thought that occurred to me you know this ayak cortez
[3:20:36.460 --> 3:20:41.820]  what she's engaged in and it's getting blatant not only her almost all of the radical
[3:20:42.780 --> 3:20:48.860]  communists slash democrats are now using straight from hitler gobbles the big lie
[3:20:48.860 --> 3:20:56.060]  they well the main point i think of the interview with the wells fargo executive was so that ayak
[3:20:56.060 --> 3:21:02.620]  could screech about putting children in cages children in cages children in cages it's pure
[3:21:02.620 --> 3:21:10.380]  hitler propaganda just keep repeating a big lie and the dunning kruger democrats the morons
[3:21:10.380 --> 3:21:16.460]  they're laughing it up oh my god trump is evil he's putting children in cages the fact of it
[3:21:16.460 --> 3:21:22.940]  means nothing the truth of it absolutely means nothing and what i would like to say now when
[3:21:22.940 --> 3:21:28.460]  you're being accused basically of you know torturing children everything but genocide
[3:21:28.460 --> 3:21:33.820]  we're called racist we're called nazis trump is called a nazi after charlottesville which is
[3:21:33.820 --> 3:21:40.220]  if you ever see the transcripts 100 out of context he never said the you know alt right nazis with
[3:21:40.220 --> 3:21:45.580]  the uh torches were good guys it wasn't at all at all but that's another big lie they just
[3:21:45.580 --> 3:21:51.900]  say it say it and say it and it sticks so my reaction is it's time to take off the gloves
[3:21:53.260 --> 3:22:02.460]  just like the islamists the communists lie their secular religion of communism has taqiyah
[3:22:03.020 --> 3:22:09.980]  exactly the same like the jihad islamists if it furthers communism then you can deny you're
[3:22:09.980 --> 3:22:16.140]  communist just like you can deny you're an islamist i'm a moderate muslim you can say i'm a just a
[3:22:16.140 --> 3:22:22.860]  moderate dem sock democrat socialist i'm not a communist every time i would hammer them i i
[3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:29.180]  personally call call them communists call them lying communists point out to everyone that
[3:22:29.180 --> 3:22:37.580]  communists feel justified in lying because to them the central tenet of marxism is the end
[3:22:37.580 --> 3:22:46.300]  justifies the means so lying to gull us rubes out in flyover country is just a tactic so there's no
[3:22:46.300 --> 3:22:52.940]  point in being polite back to these people call them communists remind everyone communists and
[3:22:52.940 --> 3:22:59.820]  socialists killed over a hundred million innocent people in the 20th century and now they're lining
[3:22:59.820 --> 3:23:06.060]  up to do it again aok has the nerve to say that capitalism is unsustainable and irredeemable
[3:23:06.060 --> 3:23:12.380]  hello has she studied what's happening in venezuela the only solution for any country like venezuela
[3:23:12.380 --> 3:23:16.780]  is the free market i don't even like using the term capitalism that's using the enemy
[3:23:16.780 --> 3:23:24.380]  vocabulary it's free market economics free versus planned socialist economy which always
[3:23:24.380 --> 3:23:30.940]  results in a disaster but it's not a disaster for the people in charge if you're one of the elite
[3:23:30.940 --> 3:23:35.420]  the people in the street can be eating each other they can be in you know diving in dumpsters they
[3:23:35.420 --> 3:23:41.020]  can be selling children it doesn't matter because your hold on power becomes more strong and you're
[3:23:41.020 --> 3:23:46.140]  always going to be able to use your secret police to hide the fact that you are still you're living
[3:23:46.140 --> 3:23:51.900]  the high life flying helicopters and private jets even just like north korea but but hidden
[3:23:51.900 --> 3:23:59.180]  except instead of a starving north korea it's a starving venezuela so when aok aok should never get
[3:23:59.180 --> 3:24:06.940]  a free pass to say that socialism is the answer socialism is communism the ussr was not called
[3:24:06.940 --> 3:24:14.940]  the union of communist republics it was called the union of soviet socialist republics the
[3:24:14.940 --> 3:24:20.940]  communist country its name was socialist not communist and it's a central planet of marxism
[3:24:20.940 --> 3:24:26.620]  that socialism is just a pathway to communism and we need to get on this and stay on it like a
[3:24:26.620 --> 3:24:33.980]  bulldog now just a just a quick reminder about the infowars store i know it goes on but this can't
[3:24:33.980 --> 3:24:41.100]  be stated enough there are fewer and fewer channels open for the truth and the and the alex jones show
[3:24:41.100 --> 3:24:47.020]  that i'm privileged to be sitting here today the alex jones show is one of them i mean i just saw
[3:24:47.020 --> 3:24:52.940]  the uh the clips that were put together that that alex showed last hour with the uh you know the
[3:24:52.940 --> 3:24:59.340]  the youtube woman explaining why all these bands happened and and it's it's just ridiculous they
[3:24:59.340 --> 3:25:05.740]  were they are willing to live to take things out of context spend things 180 degrees and use them
[3:25:05.740 --> 3:25:13.260]  as an excuse to shut down conservatives and libertarians meanwhile antifa no holds barred so
[3:25:13.900 --> 3:25:20.060]  if you have if you have um you know a couple bucks and you want to keep a great program on the air
[3:25:20.060 --> 3:25:28.460]  the infowars store is having a mega sale right now free shipping double patriot points all supplements

[3:25:59.740 --> 3:26:05.980]  can pull them off i'm not stupid and i had a a gadstein flag and i had a trump make america
[3:26:05.980 --> 3:26:12.060]  great again bumper sticker so i must have been passed or passed 10 000 cars in that two-day drive up
[3:26:12.060 --> 3:26:17.340]  and back and i was proud to do it you've got to get out and represent what they're trying to do is
[3:26:17.340 --> 3:26:22.780]  call us into silence and this is what this is what's not only happening in america if you've
[3:26:22.780 --> 3:26:29.980]  been following tommy robinson if you haven't seen the video called pano drama which is named it's a
[3:26:29.980 --> 3:26:37.580]  play on the the word panorama which is like a a 60 minutes of the bbc tommy robinson did a sting
[3:26:37.580 --> 3:26:42.700]  on these guys where they thought they were coming to interview him and he had clips undercover clips
[3:26:42.700 --> 3:26:49.420]  of these these pano panorama executives talking about how they were going to lie about tommy
[3:26:49.420 --> 3:26:54.620]  splice things together how that the entire project was called tommy takedown this was just the most
[3:26:54.620 --> 3:27:01.180]  broad video now tommy's only up still on youtube when this video came out he was kicked off of
[3:27:01.180 --> 3:27:07.020]  facebook with the help of islamist communist groups like hope not eight eight they're always
[3:27:07.020 --> 3:27:13.180]  they always named themselves by a lie he was taken right off of facebook he's been off of twitter
[3:27:13.180 --> 3:27:18.860]  and he's taken off of instagram so what they're doing is they're cornering us they're marginalizing
[3:27:18.860 --> 3:27:26.060]  us they're pushing us into the edges i myself the day after pano drama came out i put a link
[3:27:26.060 --> 3:27:32.860]  on facebook just a link to a youtube video which was not a band youtube video it's still on youtube
[3:27:32.860 --> 3:27:39.100]  i put the pano drama link up and i got my seventh 30 day facebook suspension or ban
[3:27:39.740 --> 3:27:43.900]  in the last year and a half so they give me basically a month then they find a reason to
[3:27:43.900 --> 3:27:49.020]  kick me off for a month and i don't know this time it's like the day after st patrick's day i'm due
[3:27:49.020 --> 3:27:53.180]  to come out of the cooler you know i'm like the cooler king on facebook i'm due to come out of

[3:27:59.420 --> 3:28:03.580]  home facebook in a few days but i don't know if i'm going to do it now i just don't think that it's
[3:28:03.580 --> 3:28:07.420]  worth it you're just begging to be on enemy territory like people have suggested i go back
[3:28:07.420 --> 3:28:13.580]  to twitter under a new name i won't do it i'm not gonna you know disguise myself and sneak into a
[3:28:13.580 --> 3:28:18.940]  club where they already threw me on the street i just won't do it so in the next segment when we

[3:34:03.180 --> 3:34:09.180]  um has been taken off of amazon you can still find mind comp you can find all kind of jihad
[3:34:09.180 --> 3:34:15.740]  literature but tommy robinson talking about the jihad threat to europe and to the uk in particular
[3:34:16.380 --> 3:34:22.780]  can't be talked about and you can see how the social media titans they're happy to cooperate
[3:34:22.780 --> 3:34:28.620]  with these left-wing groups like in the state's southern poverty law center or over in the uk
[3:34:28.620 --> 3:34:35.180]  hope not hate they're happy to so we're in it we're in a box we're definitely in a box there
[3:34:35.180 --> 3:34:40.220]  we can still talk but they're dialing down our our output you know they're walking behind us with
[3:34:40.220 --> 3:34:47.580]  the wire cutters uh clipping the cords and yanking out the plugs so it's it's really important support
[3:34:47.580 --> 3:34:55.740]  info wars keep info wars going super important support tommy robinson by his book enemy of the
[3:34:55.740 --> 3:35:01.260]  state it's still available by my books by anybody's books that's you know that has this vision that
[3:35:01.260 --> 3:35:08.300]  we share because it is important it is all going down the tubes if we don't and in the last few
[3:35:08.300 --> 3:35:13.980]  months i've been searching all over the landscape for you know social media alternatives that can
[3:35:13.980 --> 3:35:21.660]  work that and uh there's a somebody very close to me was just booted off of youtube he's not as
[3:35:21.660 --> 3:35:28.780]  well known as tommy robinson is um his name on the internet is vlad tepez he lives in a country
[3:35:28.780 --> 3:35:34.300]  where he has to be very very careful very careful so anyway i use my real name and face he doesn't
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:40.220]  he can't he can't afford to but what he has done is set up a website an amazing website
[3:35:40.780 --> 3:35:47.980]  where he has connections to translators that can take a news clip from i don't care if it's in
[3:35:47.980 --> 3:35:55.180]  finnish or if it's in bulgarian the next day it'll be subtitled so that it can be shared all around
[3:35:55.180 --> 3:36:00.540]  the world you know what you say what difference does that make a swedish video a video from italy
[3:36:00.540 --> 3:36:06.140]  i can't speak swedish or italian well you don't need to but it's important to understand this is not
[3:36:06.140 --> 3:36:12.700]  just an american phenomenon this social media shunning and vlad since he was kicked off of youtube
[3:36:12.700 --> 3:36:19.500]  check this out he had 30 000 videos most of them are like two to five minute clips most of them
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:28.540]  translated 30 000 videos 30 million distinct views often linked on info wars they just shut
[3:36:28.540 --> 3:36:34.940]  them down removed his channel and deleted years worth of work not just uploading videos but arranging
[3:36:34.940 --> 3:36:41.100]  these translations until he just disappeared so what's left well you can you know there's there's
[3:36:41.100 --> 3:36:47.900]  bit chute there's there's um many other alternatives but one that he's actually using right now is called
[3:36:47.900 --> 3:36:56.540]  bit.tube and it's a a true bit torrent bit chute was sold as bit torrent but it really is using
[3:36:56.540 --> 3:37:03.900]  servers and bit tube is a pure bit torrent site this is not rocket science the bit torrent theory
[3:37:03.900 --> 3:37:09.180]  has been around for a long time but bit tube is trying to make a go of it using true bit torrent
[3:37:09.180 --> 3:37:16.060]  technology if you click on a video after 10 or 15 seconds as it's drawing in um you know more of
[3:37:16.060 --> 3:37:23.740]  the torrent the video will come up to very high def most bit chute videos run at like 480 but you
[3:37:23.740 --> 3:37:29.820]  can use the sprocket and dial the height the def up as high as you want and everybody that joins
[3:37:29.820 --> 3:37:36.140]  is part of it but nobody's paying in it's you're basically agreeing to be part of this sharing
[3:37:36.140 --> 3:37:42.700]  network that's the essence of bit torrent it can't be shut down because there is no central server
[3:37:42.700 --> 3:37:48.460]  there is no boss somewhere you know that has all the videos saved the videos are in the cloud the
[3:37:48.460 --> 3:37:56.060]  videos are shared between all our computers so give bit.tube a look and the guy I know Vlad
[3:37:56.060 --> 3:38:02.300]  Tefes is trying to rebuild the 30 000 videos that were taken down by youtube if and if this is a
[3:38:02.300 --> 3:38:07.740]  message from Vlad if you have in if you can remember in particular great videos that you had saved
[3:38:07.740 --> 3:38:14.300]  and you can remember their titles um contact me or contact Vlad through VladTepes.com
[3:38:14.300 --> 3:38:21.100]  VladTepesBlog.com and tell him and he'll reupload the videos that really struck people
[3:38:21.100 --> 3:38:27.820]  up on to bit.tube but this is really super important because if we just play on the enemy
[3:38:27.820 --> 3:38:35.660]  terrain we are just circling the dream we have no chance unless we find our own way that's not
[3:38:35.660 --> 3:38:42.060]  subject to censorship and you know there there are not only bit.tube is one one another one that
[3:38:42.060 --> 3:38:50.780]  is suggested now is something called is called dissenter.com which is an offshoot of gab which
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:58.460]  has its own you know story and gab is still extremely viable for people that you know like gab i
[3:38:58.460 --> 3:39:03.100]  do recommend it if you know for the people that uh enjoy it but gab has an offshoot called the
[3:39:03.100 --> 3:39:09.100]  resister the dissenter.com where people just post links to articles so there's no problem with
[3:39:09.100 --> 3:39:14.140]  copyright or anything like that you know in a fast computer era it doesn't matter if you know you're
[3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:19.580]  just putting a link and then then you can click between two windows you can see the article then
[3:39:19.580 --> 3:39:25.660]  make comments and these comments are not going to be subject to censorship now to keep them from being
[3:39:25.660 --> 3:39:31.340]  spammed and trolled what the liberals do is you know they'll post you know kitty porn pictures
[3:39:31.340 --> 3:39:37.020]  things like that then have media matters take a screen capture to try to shut down the conservative
[3:39:37.020 --> 3:39:43.500]  website remember it's a linsky tactics it's mafia they know nothing is out of bounds for these guys
[3:39:43.500 --> 3:39:51.900]  nothing so so by using the dissenter.com you're going around that and we'll see if this can stand
[3:39:51.900 --> 3:39:56.460]  up and survive it's growing like crazy it's really growing and we'll you know we'll see
[3:39:56.460 --> 3:40:03.500]  where it goes but you know my point is try to distribute the your links try to distribute
[3:40:03.500 --> 3:40:09.820]  your information one that i'm still in freeze oxy it's still up and you know you can post
[3:40:09.820 --> 3:40:16.140]  slinks there videos etc but um you know i'm off of twitter forever i don't think i'll go back to
[3:40:16.140 --> 3:40:22.460]  facebook and we've all got to find an alternative uh info wars itself is is emerging as a pretty good
[3:40:22.460 --> 3:40:27.820]  social media platform in its own right the point is let's stop playing in enemy territory i know
[3:40:27.820 --> 3:40:33.260]  facebook has got a lot of great attributes and all your family's on it so it makes it real easy
[3:40:33.260 --> 3:40:39.100]  to share political stuff with one family member and you know kitty me kitten memes with another
[3:40:39.100 --> 3:40:45.420]  family member but but when we're going to facebook we're putting money in jeff zucker in zuckerberg's
[3:40:45.420 --> 3:40:53.420]  pocket you remember how he was back in europe like two years ago talking to um to merkel and and
[3:40:53.420 --> 3:40:57.900]  saying yeah we've got to do something about all this conservatism on the internet and he's like
[3:40:57.900 --> 3:41:03.020]  i'm with you you know we'll we'll get rid of him we'll take him down uh that's a paraphrase but
[3:41:03.020 --> 3:41:09.740]  that's what they meant that was caught on an open mic and you know we're we're just playing on enemy
[3:41:09.740 --> 3:41:15.340]  turf when we go there so anybody that contacts me if you've got a better link if you've got a
[3:41:15.340 --> 3:41:21.900]  better suggestion for video streaming for for social media i'm all ears because this is really
[3:41:21.900 --> 3:41:27.980]  in the in the emerging warfare leading up to 2020 political warfare i mean internet warfare
[3:41:27.980 --> 3:41:35.100]  electronic warfare social media is a key battlefield and you can just imagine as we get closer to the
[3:41:35.100 --> 3:41:42.380]  2020 how effective voices will be increasingly banned from left wing social media it doesn't
[3:41:42.380 --> 3:41:49.420]  take a rocket science to see that what happened to to uh info wars was just a you know a beta test
[3:41:49.980 --> 3:41:55.260]  for doing this to more and more conservatives first if they come for alex jones then they come
[3:41:55.260 --> 3:42:01.260]  for tommy robinson and they come for matt bracken and there's no end to it and something that it
[3:42:01.260 --> 3:42:06.860]  drives me crazy i still hear people talking about being the gray man i'm just gonna slide through
[3:42:06.860 --> 3:42:11.820]  this attempted bolshevik revolution which is probably gonna lead to a civil war i'm gonna
[3:42:11.820 --> 3:42:17.260]  stay in the shadows you know what i say that the gray man is the gray man is a coward unless you got
[3:42:17.260 --> 3:42:23.340]  like six kids under 10 years old and a job in the government maybe but the gray man is a coward
[3:42:23.340 --> 3:42:28.860]  the gray man ensures that the communists are going to win because he won't come out of his
[3:42:28.860 --> 3:42:34.700]  hiding hole until the dust smoke is cleared but when the smoke is cleared there might be gulag
[3:42:34.700 --> 3:42:41.980]  barbed wire around his hole and then what gray man so put your info wars bumper sticker on a magnet
[3:42:41.980 --> 3:42:47.420]  if you want like me put your mag of bumper sticker on the back of your car on a magnet if it makes you
[3:42:47.420 --> 3:42:54.940]  feel better but get out and present represent don't be a coward don't be the gray man and uh
[3:42:54.940 --> 3:42:59.100]  thick will be coming back just uh in a few minutes i've got some really good news though

[3:47:24.140 --> 3:47:34.780]  okay before i um get off of social media and youtube and all of that entirely i did want to
[3:47:34.780 --> 3:47:41.180]  mention something uh still on youtube like tommy robinson is is one of the best videos i've seen
[3:47:41.180 --> 3:47:47.180]  in i don't know how long uh for really good videos i think you have to wait because it takes a while
[3:47:47.180 --> 3:47:52.700]  for the inspiration and to produce them and then life gets in the way you know there's uh you can
[3:47:52.700 --> 3:47:58.460]  catch the flu you can uh be on adult business trips i get it but paul aron paul joseph watson
[3:47:58.460 --> 3:48:04.220]  his newest video which is up uh last night is called the collapse of western civilization
[3:48:05.100 --> 3:48:12.220]  and not only should everybody in the in the info wars audience watch this video i recommend that you
[3:48:12.220 --> 3:48:17.260]  share it share it with your family that aren't completely closed off to the potential of what's
[3:48:17.260 --> 3:48:24.300]  coming i mean it's it's so well done it's just it's just amazing you know i wish that i could
[3:48:24.300 --> 3:48:32.380]  do videos like that i don't have the talent that he has but i can at least push it promote it
[3:48:32.380 --> 3:48:39.340]  encourage people to share the links and save them on other video sites like bit shoot and bit tube and
[3:48:39.340 --> 3:48:47.980]  uh uh the other ones but watch the video and share it's it's literally about indicators going back
[3:48:47.980 --> 3:48:54.460]  through every civilization about the imminent collapse of that civilization and paul joseph watson
[3:48:54.460 --> 3:49:00.700]  just ticks them off and has experts talking about each one and uh and you know in video clips inside
[3:49:00.700 --> 3:49:05.660]  of the video but i i can't recommend it too much please share it with your family and if they think
[3:49:05.660 --> 3:49:10.940]  it's a joke if they think it's you're being hyperbolic at least it's been planted the seed has
[3:49:10.940 --> 3:49:17.260]  been planted and while i'm on youtube there are three other guys at least three i mean three that
[3:49:17.260 --> 3:49:23.580]  come off the top of my head black pigeon speaks who's a an american expat in japan i believe he
[3:49:23.580 --> 3:49:30.780]  never he's not shown on camera just his voice his videos are brilliant if if you have the time go back
[3:49:30.780 --> 3:49:38.700]  and and surf through his videos bps black pigeon speaks he's a genius sargon of akkad he's not
[3:49:38.700 --> 3:49:44.140]  exactly a conservative but he's been very fair on the social media issue um you know with the
[3:49:44.140 --> 3:49:51.500]  the rogan interview last week etc he's extremely fair sargon of akkad i look one my subscribed
[3:49:51.500 --> 3:49:57.900]  favorites for these guys every day and right up there with sargon black pigeon speaks and paul
[3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:05.900]  joseph watson i put the brit named iconoclast he's also just terrific to me these are the top tier
[3:50:05.900 --> 3:50:11.580]  they make videos that are you know five 12 minutes long but they have something to say these guys are
[3:50:11.580 --> 3:50:17.020]  geniuses and you might not have the argument to give to your to your family member your your
[3:50:17.020 --> 3:50:23.180]  your uh associates at work but if you can drop the links in a in a non-judgmental way just like hey
[3:50:23.180 --> 3:50:29.340]  check this out you can red pill a lot of people and and that's the point of what we're doing here
[3:50:29.340 --> 3:50:36.380]  it's not enough for us to preach to the choir coming to info wars shopping in the info wars store
[3:50:36.380 --> 3:50:43.580]  all of that's great but if we're not rebroadcasting to the larger audience that doesn't watch
[3:50:43.580 --> 3:50:49.820]  then we're not really doing our part you know alex uh david night we're all they're all doing all
[3:50:49.820 --> 3:50:56.780]  that they can but promoting the video clips you know war room with owen promote the video clips
[3:50:56.780 --> 3:51:03.260]  share them you have it in the power you know millions of individuals have it in their power
[3:51:03.260 --> 3:51:09.180]  to to relink these links and increase by many fold the number of eyes and minds that will
[3:51:09.180 --> 3:51:15.260]  be exposed to this information it's not enough that you know and you know what i think about you
[3:51:15.260 --> 3:51:22.220]  gray men you know hiding in your hole till the dust settles it's too late for that you've got to get
[3:51:22.220 --> 3:51:29.740]  out you've got to stand up you've got to not only be brave personally you're you have to be brave
[3:51:29.740 --> 3:51:35.100]  for the other ones for the other ones you know there's a reason those uh you know the lieutenants
[3:51:35.100 --> 3:51:40.300]  would go over the top first just with a whistle and a pistol because the enlisted men aren't going
[3:51:40.300 --> 3:51:46.780]  to go if the lieutenant and the captain are hiding you've got to be the brave man not the gray man
[3:51:46.780 --> 3:51:54.220]  if you're waiting for john wane he's not coming if you're waiting for paul revere he's already come
[3:51:54.220 --> 3:52:00.220]  a hundred times now is the time to stand up and blow your own horn i mean if you're if you're
[3:52:00.220 --> 3:52:06.620]  too chicken to put a magnetized info wars or mega bumper sticker on your car good grief what's it
[3:52:06.620 --> 3:52:10.540]  what's going to happen when they're doing red flags and people are getting shot are you suddenly
[3:52:10.540 --> 3:52:15.340]  going to get brave then how's that work i've never seen that happen in my life if you're if you're
[3:52:15.340 --> 3:52:21.500]  too afraid to wear the t-shirt the info wars t-shirt if you're too afraid now you think you'll
[3:52:21.500 --> 3:52:26.220]  suddenly be so brave you'll be digging up your gun no you won't you'll be hiding until we're
[3:52:26.220 --> 3:52:33.900]  bolshevized so now is the time to be brave and this this brings me up to um to donald trump
[3:52:33.900 --> 3:52:39.180]  and our great hopes for him when he was elected number one he was a great hope because he was
[3:52:39.180 --> 3:52:45.500]  not hillary clinton if hillary had won the deep state coup would have been a complete success
[3:52:46.380 --> 3:52:52.300]  the plan as we now know from from the page and struck uh released interviews the congressman
[3:52:52.300 --> 3:52:58.540]  just released these pdf files the plan was well this was probably you know you can read between
[3:52:58.540 --> 3:53:07.100]  the lines this was the tarmac deal plan hillary wins loretta lynch stays on as attorney general
[3:53:07.100 --> 3:53:12.860]  so she can continue to hide and cover up all the crimes uranium one everything else fast and furious
[3:53:12.860 --> 3:53:18.860]  you all the crimes she can continue to be the crypt keeper of democrat crimes coby stays on
[3:53:18.860 --> 3:53:24.700]  his fbi director and when he's had enough he's going to give it to mccabe the trusted andrew
[3:53:24.700 --> 3:53:30.540]  mccabe deep state ses operative and they will just keep the same game playing well trump
[3:53:30.540 --> 3:53:36.860]  was the great disruptor he blew that up that's why struck and page uh were texting each other
[3:53:36.860 --> 3:53:41.980]  about you know the menace that he is and thank god that those emails as those text messages were
[3:53:41.980 --> 3:53:49.420]  recovered now i in the last two days i read both the page and struck testimonies it's not as dull
[3:53:49.420 --> 3:53:55.980]  as it looks when you open that pdf uh script file but if you just are looking for like you know
[3:53:55.980 --> 3:54:02.860]  meadows and uh jordan and you skip the uh you know the democrat communist because you know they're
[3:54:02.860 --> 3:54:07.820]  just going to be saying you know isn't it terrible that the fbi is losing its respect because of
[3:54:07.820 --> 3:54:13.260]  those are horrible conservatives so just scroll past that that cuts the reading in half and you
[3:54:13.260 --> 3:54:21.020]  can you can clearly see they had this all planned out and it and trump blew up the plan but since he
[3:54:21.020 --> 3:54:25.340]  was elected how's he been doing how much wall is being built he says that the wall is being built
[3:54:25.900 --> 3:54:31.020]  the emergency uh resolution the vote on the emergency resolution i guess that's today i don't
[3:54:31.020 --> 3:54:38.460]  know if it's going to happen i haven't been keeping track but all since ever since 2016 in the election
[3:54:38.460 --> 3:54:45.260]  we've been led on with false hopes galling the rubes first it was stealth jeff jeff's sessions
[3:54:45.260 --> 3:54:51.500]  wasn't really just you know uh the legend of sleepy hollow he was actually a tornado hidden and he's
[3:54:51.500 --> 3:54:58.780]  going to come out any day and and lay the deep state coup bear false q and on in my opinion total
[3:54:58.780 --> 3:55:04.780]  hoax from day one just like you know many other hoaxes in the past the hitler diaries uh howard
[3:55:04.780 --> 3:55:10.860]  hughes diaries etc total hoax and i and i really hate hoaxes because you know if you want to write
[3:55:10.860 --> 3:55:17.020]  fiction be a novelist put it in a book call it fiction so nothing came out of q and on all the
[3:55:17.020 --> 3:55:23.260]  promises about the you know the eventual exposure of the deep state coup then there's huber oh huber
[3:55:23.260 --> 3:55:28.380]  is coming in we've got a guy out in utah he's going to get to the bottom of it and now the latest of
[3:55:28.380 --> 3:55:35.900]  these of these hopefully not this time of false hope uh is is attorney general bar is now in in
[3:55:35.900 --> 3:55:41.660]  supposedly in command and he looks like a guy that's quite the opposite of uh sleepy stealth jeff
[3:55:42.460 --> 3:55:49.660]  um i think that it's no accident that weissman quit or announce he's quitting today and i use
[3:55:49.660 --> 3:55:56.700]  an analogy to a poker game if miller is at the poker table he's got the big hand that everybody
[3:55:56.700 --> 3:56:01.660]  expects has four aces or at least that's what the the left-wing media is hoping hoping that's
[3:56:01.660 --> 3:56:06.860]  what uh you know the uh democrats are hoping and it's looking increasingly like it's enough
[3:56:06.860 --> 3:56:13.020]  there's nothing there i mean elsewise wouldn't have leaked but then it then where everybody's
[3:56:13.020 --> 3:56:17.340]  saying well why doesn't just trump just declassify everything it's in his power to declassify well
[3:56:17.340 --> 3:56:23.020]  it's a poker game it's the the sequence of who lays down cards is very important trump isn't
[3:56:23.020 --> 3:56:28.860]  going to declassify to the miller the definitive miller report is out and digested then i think
[3:56:28.860 --> 3:56:35.580]  he'll declassify but short of that this congressman that that um released publicly the class that they
[3:56:35.580 --> 3:56:42.300]  then classified or confidential uh transcripts of the page and the struck testimony what he's doing
[3:56:42.300 --> 3:56:48.860]  is throwing down another card which bueller has to react to and with weissman quitting now
[3:56:48.860 --> 3:56:56.060]  now and we don't what we can only imagine what's been going on now between bar and miller and
[3:56:56.060 --> 3:57:01.100]  weissman all of these characters the congressional committees we don't know because they know a
[3:57:01.100 --> 3:57:07.340]  lot more than we do and so what we can see from through the through the keyhole what we can see
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:13.580]  is what looks like a game being played of timing weissman quitting they may be going into cya
[3:57:13.580 --> 3:57:18.940]  mode you know weissman may be lowering up pretty soon because you know the uh for sure lindsey grand
[3:57:18.940 --> 3:57:23.340]  mark meadows jeff jordan they're not going to let go of this phone they're going to tear it up
[3:57:24.140 --> 3:57:28.700]  now we'll see what can come of it but i don't think that they're on the lease i think you know
[3:57:28.700 --> 3:57:33.900]  in these in the transcripts preg out he was terrific but he's quick i guess trey's you know
[3:57:34.940 --> 3:57:41.100]  one of the tv career or something but um you know the real heroes the the jordan's and the meadows
[3:57:41.100 --> 3:57:46.940]  they are fighters they are fighters and we're just coming up now through the big uh the big
