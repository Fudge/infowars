[00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:16.969]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.790]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.671]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:22.392]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:22.392 --> 00:00:24.053]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:28.736]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.692 --> 00:00:34.673]  We are live!
[00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:42.157]  It is the 14th of March, 2019, and Alex Jones will be in place for the third hour.
[00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:45.299]  For the time being, we're talking about Beto Mania.
[00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:46.660]  Of course, he's in it.
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.483]  Okay, we're gonna have to put up with Beto and his skateboard for the next 18 months at least.
[00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:54.025]  The absolute horror of that.
[00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:59.328]  Beto has come out, he's down, so he came out in an interview last night, kind of teased it, now it's official.
[00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.734]  And he's trying to move away from the centre already.
[00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:13.061]  We have this civil war within the Democratic Party of the extreme left-wing fringe versus the moderate centre.
[00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:17.104]  There was the big debate about whether the moderate centre would move left later on down the line.
[00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:21.427]  Well Beto's already moving left, he's moving to the fringe, moving to the extreme.
[00:01:21.427 --> 00:01:29.953]  He's talking about the planet ending 12 years time just like AOC did a couple of weeks ago, where doom
[00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:43.992]  Beto O'Rourke starts a presidential campaign by claiming the world faces catastrophe, warns hundreds of millions of climate refugees, will overwhelm borders and humanity could go extinct unless we fix the planet in 12 years.
[00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:48.773]  So he's already going over the top with his over-the-top rhetoric.
[00:01:48.773 --> 00:01:52.474]  Again, moving to the left fringe of the Democratic Party.
[00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:57.596]  That gives you a sense of how it's going to be in the next year, 18 months going forward.
[00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:58.716]  Also talking about Brexit,
[00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:04.514]  Donald Trump has just come out and said you have to be prepared to walk away from a bad deal.
[00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:11.358]  With the exact quote, the worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.
[00:02:11.358 --> 00:02:13.739]  That makes the other guy smell blood, then you're dead.
[00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.601]  Theresa May, are you listening?
[00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:23.384]  We basically have a situation in the UK now where the country is no longer democratic.
[00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:26.766]  Now they're going to vote on delaying Brexit yet again.
[00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:28.187]  Last night they voted on
[00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:31.337]  Cutting out, eliminating no deal altogether.
[00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:38.222]  Nigel Farage has announced that Parliament no longer represents the people.
[00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:42.906]  We have the Queen waiting and thinks, when will the Queen be activated?
[00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:53.854]  Basically we have a dictatorship of MPs in Parliament that have overridden the trade, that have ignored the will of 17.4 million people.
[00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:57.877]  She needs to step up to the plate to protect democracy.
[00:02:58.915 --> 00:03:05.762]  RT reports no delay from EU or we elect seven free Nigel Farage to European Parliament.
[00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:09.966]  That is the situation if this Brexit deal gets delayed past the end of May.
[00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.848]  We're going to have European elections.
[00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:20.937]  We're going to have a flood of MEPs to stand for Brexit, for democracy, for the British people and against the EU super states.
[00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:22.459]  I hope we talk about that as well.
[00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:28.950]  Tucker Carlson remains under attack from the George Soros-funded Media Matters outfit.
[00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:41.875]  Now he's hit back by pointing out that Angelo Frasone, one of the main architects of the peace against him, said probably way worse things than he did, so we're going to play it back.
[00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:48.037]  Also talking about Facebook and Instagram suffering their most severe outages ever.
[00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:49.858]  This is the problem with the novel.
[00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:51.899]  How on earth could Facebook,
[00:03:52.537 --> 00:03:57.062]  Instagram, Oculus, WhatsApp, all go down at the same time.
[00:03:57.062 --> 00:04:01.927]  In one case, Facebook went down for 14 hours straight.
[00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:03.969]  No explanation for the outage.
[00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.354]  Why are all these different platforms on the same platform?
[00:04:08.354 --> 00:04:09.935]  This is the weakness of monopolies.
[00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:15.201]  This is why these big tech corporations need to be covered up with new anti-trust laws.
[00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:23.682]  Stephen Colbert in Tulsi Gabbard who is one of the democratic contenders who actually talks any sense and is reasonable.
[00:04:23.682 --> 00:04:36.553]  Basically he's now fully thrown his weight behind Orpos if I'm to say after having his teeth on going after George H. W. Bush or being a warmonger as his teeth completely flipped.
[00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:37.534]  Meanwhile in Europe
[00:04:38.447 --> 00:04:45.943]  You have Germany deliberately ignoring and concealing migrant crimes while avoiding stirring up prejudice.
[00:04:45.943 --> 00:04:47.908]  Highlights of this issue.
[00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:49.191]  Perhaps they're actually now...
[00:04:50.057 --> 00:04:57.421]  Concealing, covering up crimes committed by migrants to prevent some kind of civil unrest in Germany.
[00:04:57.421 --> 00:05:02.343]  Though we're going to talk about that and a whole host more on the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:04.844]  Also Norwegian Writers Slam's dishonest media for hiding.
[00:05:04.844 --> 00:05:08.326]  We've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:12.508]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore in a year and a half fight.
[00:05:12.508 --> 00:05:16.270]  But we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best
[00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.211]  Atomic Iodide in the world.
[00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:19.352]  X2 is back.
[00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:20.112]  We got it.
[00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:21.793]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:05:21.793 --> 00:05:23.394]  We rushed it into production.
[00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:24.175]  It's been bottled.
[00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:26.156]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:31.499]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.
[00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:33.280]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.421]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.

[00:05:52.797 --> 00:05:54.018]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:55.579]  That's your right for supplements.
[00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:58.742]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:58.742 --> 00:06:00.684]  It is X2 Original.
[00:06:00.684 --> 00:06:02.986]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:15.464 --> 00:06:28.952]  Live from the Infowars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:40.340]  We're live and we're talking about Beto announcing that he will run no surprise at this point obviously he came out in a TV interview last night and basically all but said that now it's being confirmed
[00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:46.078]  Breitbart reports, left mocks Beto's messiah-esque born-to-run remarks.
[00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:49.299]  Peak white male privilege.
[00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:51.520]  Now they're already eating their own.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.281]  This is absolutely hilarious and this goes to the point.
[00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:09.126]  If Beto is going to have to spend half of his time up on the debate platform excusing himself for being a white male, for having white male privilege, and denying the presidency to a woman or to a minority.
[00:07:10.143 --> 00:07:12.144]  How's he going to win that race?
[00:07:12.144 --> 00:07:22.647]  How's he going to get through that field of women, of minorities, with them already feasting upon him for the crime of being a white male?
[00:07:22.647 --> 00:07:34.150]  Left-wing activists and liberal journalists were quick to mock former rep Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke on Wednesday evening after he told Vanity Fair that he was born to run for president.
[00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.911]  He told Vanity Fair, quote, you can probably tell I want to run, I do, I think I'd be good at it.
[00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:40.782]  I'm just born to be in it.
[00:07:40.782 --> 00:07:44.403]  I want to do everything I humanly can for this country at the moment.
[00:07:44.403 --> 00:07:51.685]  But hours after they published that fawning story, O'Rourke confirmed to KTSM in Texas he would announce on Thursday that he is running for president.
[00:07:51.685 --> 00:07:53.265]  That's now happened.
[00:07:53.265 --> 00:07:59.726]  But his critics immediately played the identity politics card.
[00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:03.107]  Alex Segura on Twitter, some verified liberal or other,
[00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.294]  Said, quote, I'm just born to be in it.
[00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:08.897]  It's peak white male privilege.
[00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:13.181]  And I say this as someone who generally likes Beto.
[00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:15.283]  Bakari Sellers said, vote Beto.
[00:08:15.283 --> 00:08:16.264]  He was born to do it.
[00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:18.166]  That's weird as hell.
[00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:22.490]  Jennifer Granholm says, not sure this Vanity Fair piece will help Beto's campaign.
[00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.074]  So he's coming across as overbearing, as overprivileged, and
[00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.190]  He's a white male.
[00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.032]  How is he going to come back from being a white male?
[00:08:31.032 --> 00:08:53.181]  Again, the whole debate around this democratic field is at what point will the centre, will the moderates, will the likes of Beto and Biden be forced to move left with the Overton window as the Overton window has shifted left in terms of the Democratic Party becoming more extreme, more left-wing, more socialist, more progressive?
[00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:55.682]  And that question's pretty much been answered straight away.
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.762]  This is the headline out of the Daily Mail.
[00:08:58.762 --> 00:08:59.563]  We're doomed!
[00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:12.052]  Beto O'Rourke starts presidential campaign by claiming the world faces catastrophe and wants hundreds of millions of climate refugees will overwhelm borders and humanity could go extinct unless we fix the planet in 12 years.
[00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:19.498]  So he's jumped on board immediately with the doomsday rhetoric of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others already.
[00:09:20.572 --> 00:09:34.183]  In a video in which he warned his first presidential campaign that parts of the planet will soon become uninhabitable driving a massive wave of climate refugees across the border if America's government doesn't adopt emergency measures within the next 12 years.
[00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:43.051]  Now this is a bizarre statement because he talks about quote 300,000 immigrants and asylum seekers apprehended on the southern border
[00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:48.690]  Being a problem, but then he goes on to say, I don't necessarily think that it is.
[00:09:48.690 --> 00:10:12.889]  Oh, but by the way, if you don't pass this Green Deal, this industry stripping, jobs killing, ridiculous, absurd, partisan, hysterical package of measures that AOC introduced, that this kind of migration, this is a quote, the kind of migration and refugee flows that we will see from entire bands of this world are no longer habitable will be a crisis of a different magnitude altogether.
[00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:25.224]  So he's saying that 300,000 immigrants on the border isn't a problem but then he's saying oh it will become a problem when there are millions more because we don't pass this green deal.
[00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:38.293]  So he's already shifting left in a bid to capture this fringe extremist progressive mantra that will come to characterize the campaign of you know people like Bernie Sanders.
[00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:39.934]  But then Slate makes the point that
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.983]  Beto O'Rourke would enter the race as a man without clear political ideology.
[00:10:44.983 --> 00:10:48.165]  He's got no signature legislative achievement.
[00:10:48.165 --> 00:10:52.749]  I think the only achievement he's got so far is naming a courthouse.
[00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:59.597]  The Slate article goes on to say he has no major policy issue or a concrete agenda for the country.
[00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:11.861]  Those in the know tell The Atlantic that Beto is planning to run as a candidate, quote, offering hope that America can be better than its current partisan and hate-filled politics, that the country can come together.
[00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:15.502]  So he's trying to keep two plates spinning in the air at the same time.
[00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:18.503]  On the one hand, with this rhetoric already, he's moving left.
[00:11:19.153 --> 00:11:34.603]  And on the other hand, he's trying to move away from that kind of unhinged hysteria, the hate Trump resistance movement that will come to characterize most of the other Democratic candidates in that field, by actually trying to have a unifying message.
[00:11:34.603 --> 00:11:45.870]  That's not going to go across well on the debate stage when these others are tearing into him, because he's not going to go anti-Trump, he's not going to go far enough with his anti-Trump rhetoric.
[00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:46.310]  But then again,
[00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:58.882]  This is why even many in the mainstream media and on the left, there was a USA Today headline today, Democrats' civil war between progressives and moderates mean Trump will win in 2020.
[00:11:58.882 --> 00:12:01.764]  So they're going to rip each other apart.
[00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:13.110]  Either they're too far left-wing or they're not anti-Trump enough and that's going to basically make them rip chunks out of each other during the campaign and that is only going to benefit Donald Trump.
[00:12:14.654 --> 00:12:18.135]  Meanwhile, Rosie O'Donnell says Biden is too old to run.
[00:12:18.135 --> 00:12:22.516]  She's not the only liberal saying no to Joe.
[00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:36.638]  What nobody's talking about, and it's mentioned in some of these articles, in this Me Too era, is the documented problem that creepy Uncle Joe has with women and, let's face it, children.
[00:12:36.638 --> 00:12:40.739]  Most of these articles mention his behavior around women, which is notorious.
[00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:44.220]  In fact, we had a secret service source, I did an article about this,
[00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:55.121]  Last year, I believe it was, that said it was basically impossible to bring wives and girlfriends to the White House for events with Joe Biden because he couldn't keep his hands off them.
[00:12:55.121 --> 00:13:11.188]  Now they're admitting in some of these articles, but it's buried down the bottom, Joe Biden's behavior around women and his behavior around young girls, if he runs, and that's almost certain at this point, will become the Hillary's health of 2020.
[00:13:11.188 --> 00:13:14.629]  That will be Joe Biden's
[00:13:15.447 --> 00:13:19.771]  The only thing they're saying about Joe Biden right now, the thing that's prominent, is that he's too old.
[00:13:42.225 --> 00:13:46.426]  Now, Trump was 70 at the time of his inauguration.
[00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:50.568]  Joe Biden, if he won, would be 78.
[00:13:50.568 --> 00:13:55.169]  So even by the end of his first term, he would be 82 years old.
[00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:59.990]  Rosie O'Donnell has come out and said he's too old, so they're already trying to throw Joe Biden under a bus.
[00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.131]  Remember, what was it, last week?
[00:14:02.131 --> 00:14:06.652]  He had to come out and apologise for calling Mike Pence a nice guy.
[00:14:06.652 --> 00:14:08.253]  That's how unhinged the left is.
[00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:15.133]  So any kind of reasonable rhetoric, they tamp down on it in a hurry.
[00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:17.716]  Now they're saying that he's too young.
[00:14:17.716 --> 00:14:18.957]  Rosie O'Donnell's come out.
[00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.659]  She's not the only celebrity expressing concern.
[00:14:21.659 --> 00:14:30.067]  Ken Olin, the executive producer of This Is Us, said in a tweet last week that while Biden's charisma is infectious, he comes across as authentic.
[00:14:30.067 --> 00:14:32.008]  But he's too old.
[00:14:32.008 --> 00:14:34.951]  He's not the same man he was 10 years ago, Olin tweeted.
[00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:43.251]  So they're trying to attack him on his age and they're trying to attack him on the fact that, God forbid, he said Mike Pence was a nice guy.
[00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:46.112]  But the article continues.
[00:14:46.112 --> 00:14:49.233]  This is Rosie O'Donnell says Biden is too old to run.
[00:14:49.233 --> 00:15:01.036]  In the Me Too era, Biden is also likely to face criticism for his handling of the sexual harassment allegations leveled against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas by Anita Hill during the Thomas 91 confirmation
[00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:12.280]  Last year Biden, who was the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee during those hearings, said he wished he could have done more to protect Hill, who he said got victimized again during the process.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:24.826]  So even as they acknowledge that Biden's got problems from an optics standpoint in the Me Too era, they completely fail to mention the fact that the videos are out there.
[00:15:24.826 --> 00:15:26.547]  I did one called Creepy Uncle Joe.
[00:15:26.547 --> 00:15:29.268]  I think it's got like 1.3 million views at this point.
[00:15:29.907 --> 00:15:34.179]  Those videos are only going to recirculate again and again and again.
[00:15:35.327 --> 00:15:40.029]  Biden is currently the frontrunner, but again that's mainly because of his name recognition.
[00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:45.452]  Bernie Sanders is in second position, again because of name recognition.
[00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:47.813]  Those two are going to be torn down.
[00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:51.655]  The more extreme fringe candidates are going to be pushed to the fore.
[00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:56.258]  And Beto is going to be stuck in the middle with nowhere really to go.
[00:15:56.258 --> 00:15:58.699]  We're going to get into that and more on the other side of the break.
[00:15:58.699 --> 00:16:02.221]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:16:02.221 --> 00:16:02.681]  We'll be back.

[00:17:33.516 --> 00:17:39.859]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.901]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:42.901 --> 00:17:48.824]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:48.824 --> 00:17:52.626]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:52.626 --> 00:17:53.886]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:54.887]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:54.887 --> 00:18:01.430]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.851]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:09.864]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:11.867]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[00:18:11.867 --> 00:18:14.410]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.030]  This is high-end.
[00:18:20.143 --> 00:18:23.084]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[00:18:23.084 --> 00:18:28.104]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[00:18:28.104 --> 00:18:36.986]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturing developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:39.406]  It's available exclusively at 4warslife.com.

[00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:03.547]  It's that simple.
[00:19:03.547 --> 00:19:04.428]  InfoWarsLife.com

[00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:10.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:32.438 --> 00:20:45.745]  So we have this amazing civil war within the Democratic Party which has gotten so bad to the point that none of the candidates have even been able to admit or acknowledge that they're capitalist.
[00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.026]  In fact, CNN did a good job for a change.
[00:20:48.026 --> 00:20:50.047]  The broken clock is right twice a day.
[00:20:50.871 --> 00:21:00.096]  Putting together this montage of Democratic candidates, which we'll play in a second, absolutely terrified of admitting that they're capitalists again.
[00:21:00.096 --> 00:21:12.902]  It shows how far left the Democratic Party has moved, that they're so beset with terror at being called out for being capitalists that they don't even say it when asked directly.
[00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:16.384]  Nancy Pelosi came out in the past hour and said she can't
[00:21:17.063 --> 00:21:23.605]  Basically name a single accomplishment that Beto O'Rourke had had while he was in the House of Representatives.
[00:21:23.605 --> 00:21:26.326]  I think he got one courthouse named and that was about it.
[00:21:26.326 --> 00:21:30.987]  And then President Trump came out in the past hour as well.
[00:21:30.987 --> 00:21:34.288]  Headline, Trump mocks Beto O'Rourke's hand movements.
[00:21:34.288 --> 00:21:36.768]  Is he crazy or is that the way he acts?
[00:21:36.768 --> 00:21:39.829]  So Trump's already way ahead of the curve here.
[00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:41.250]  You remember that throughout the 2016 campaign
[00:21:43.283 --> 00:21:49.267]  He identified characteristics from each of his opponents and absolutely railed them on it.
[00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:52.890]  You know, Lion Ted, Low Energy Jeb Bush.
[00:21:52.890 --> 00:22:02.056]  Stuck that target on their back and throughout the whole of their campaign they were obviously perturbed by it, trying to shift away from being framed in such a way.
[00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:08.861]  Now he's done the same for Beto O'Rourke by invoking O'Rourke's hand gestures and apparently questioning his mental condition.
[00:22:10.126 --> 00:22:12.068]  This was in the Oval Office about an hour ago.
[00:22:12.068 --> 00:22:14.871]  Trump said, quote, he has a lot of hand movement.
[00:22:14.871 --> 00:22:17.593]  Is he crazy or is that just the way he acts?
[00:22:17.593 --> 00:22:19.075]  I've never seen hand movement.
[00:22:19.075 --> 00:22:22.939]  I watched him a little while this morning doing, I assume, some kind of news conference.
[00:22:22.939 --> 00:22:25.601]  I've actually never seen anything quite like it.
[00:22:25.601 --> 00:22:26.262]  Study it.
[00:22:26.262 --> 00:22:27.223]  I'm sure you'll agree.
[00:22:28.084 --> 00:22:40.850]  So now Beto O'Rourke is going to be hyper-conscious about his hand movements for the next 18 months if he successfully makes his way through this democratic field without getting knocked out early.
[00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.771]  And Trump has painted that characteristic on him.
[00:22:43.771 --> 00:22:48.834]  Now he's always going to be hyper-aware of his hand movements and that's going to put him off, isn't it?
[00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:57.638]  Trump is an expert at doing this kind of thing, at giving people nicknames, at ascribing them certain negative or shifty behaviours.
[00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.252]  Certainly creepy Uncle Joe is going to make a comeback if he announces his run.
[00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:07.514]  But now Trump is calling out Beto O'Rourke for his crazy hand movements.
[00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:17.278]  That is not only interesting in terms of ascribing him some kind of characteristic to put him off, but also again questioning Beto's sanity.
[00:23:17.278 --> 00:23:25.201]  And I mentioned just a second ago, all the Democratic candidates are absolutely terrified about admitting to being capitalists.
[00:23:26.087 --> 00:23:29.068]  At least Beto O'Rourke has the balls to do so.
[00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:33.530]  He told CNBC, quote, I'm a capitalist.
[00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:40.153]  I don't see how we're able to meet any of the fundamental challenges that we have as a country without in part harnessing the power of the market.
[00:23:41.047 --> 00:23:56.071]  That's the same can't be said for the other Democratic candidates who failed to announce that they're capitalists again in absolute blind panic about being savaged by the left-wing fringe of the Democratic candidacy field.
[00:23:56.071 --> 00:23:59.612]  We have a CNN clip on that subject, clip 7 right now, here it is.
[00:24:01.428 --> 00:24:07.010]  So, why does the question, are you a capitalist, have so many people running for the exits?
[00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.550]  John Avalon has our answer in our reality check.
[00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:10.090]  Hi, John.
[00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.631]  Hey, Ali.
[00:24:10.631 --> 00:24:13.871]  You know what shouldn't be a tough question for someone running for president?
[00:24:13.871 --> 00:24:14.632]  It's this.
[00:24:14.632 --> 00:24:16.072]  Are you a capitalist?
[00:24:16.072 --> 00:24:16.992]  It's a layup.
[00:24:16.992 --> 00:24:17.813]  Basic stuff.
[00:24:17.813 --> 00:24:19.733]  Rooted in American history and culture.
[00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:23.334]  And yet, Democratic candidates seem to be getting spun around the axle on this one.
[00:24:23.334 --> 00:24:27.115]  And in the process, only helping Donald Trump's re-election.
[00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:30.236]  Exhibit A is John Hickenlooper, entrepreneur who bounced back from a layoff to the
[00:24:31.348 --> 00:24:36.530]  Pioneering brewpub, going on to become mayor of Denver and eventually two-term governor of Colorado.
[00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:42.333]  And yet, when Joe Scarborough gave him three chances to answer the question, he whiffed three times.
[00:24:42.333 --> 00:24:46.575]  Would you call yourself a proud capitalist?
[00:24:46.575 --> 00:24:47.575]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:24:47.575 --> 00:24:50.997]  You know, again, the labels, I'm not sure any of them fit.
[00:24:50.997 --> 00:24:54.938]  Do you consider yourself a capitalist?
[00:24:54.938 --> 00:24:58.180]  Well, again, the labels, you know, I'm a small business person.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.941]  Do you consider yourself a capitalist and does capitalism work?
[00:25:02.688 --> 00:25:07.869]  Well, I think I don't look at myself with a label.
[00:25:07.869 --> 00:25:12.631]  Look, I co-founded a group called No Labels a while ago, but that's ridiculous.
[00:25:12.631 --> 00:25:18.492]  Hickenlooper seemed afraid of angering Bernie Bros and social media mobs, but the man was a centrist Democratic governor.
[00:25:18.492 --> 00:25:19.853]  He helped flip a red state blue.
[00:25:19.853 --> 00:25:23.694]  It's the basis of his campaign, and it's nothing to apologize for.
[00:25:23.694 --> 00:25:25.314]  But Hickenlooper's not the only one.
[00:25:25.314 --> 00:25:27.155]  So, what about capitalism?
[00:25:27.155 --> 00:25:27.855]  Are you a capitalist?
[00:25:28.672 --> 00:25:34.736]  See, here's the thing with all these labels, and as you said, how they're used to define people and where they're coming from.
[00:25:34.736 --> 00:25:45.104]  But as you see, so many of these labels are misused, misunderstood to the point where people don't have any idea what they even mean anymore.
[00:25:45.104 --> 00:25:47.045]  Actually, Tulsi Gabbard may have a point there.
[00:25:47.045 --> 00:25:47.766]  According to Gallup,
[00:25:48.346 --> 00:25:53.671]  Only 17% of Americans define socialism correctly, the government ownership of the means of production.
[00:25:53.671 --> 00:25:56.854]  That's half the number who could define it properly at the start of the Cold War.
[00:25:56.854 --> 00:26:04.081]  And get this, today 6% of Americans believe socialism means being social and getting along with people.
[00:26:04.081 --> 00:26:05.983]  About a quarter can't say what it means at all.
[00:26:06.661 --> 00:26:12.743]  But Americans know what capitalism is, after America's basically been a liberal capitalist democracy since our founding.
[00:26:12.743 --> 00:26:19.285]  We've had presidents who expanded the social safety net and others who expanded free markets, but it all exists within the framework of capitalism.
[00:26:19.285 --> 00:26:24.587]  And for all its flaws, it's been far more successful at expanding freedom and prosperity than any of the alternatives.
[00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:36.496]  They have, again, Democratic candidates failing to acknowledge that they're capitalists in absolute abject terror that they get called out by the left wing of their own party.
[00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:43.841]  Another issue that's going to crop up during these primaries is the huge problem of opioid addiction in America.
[00:26:44.381 --> 00:26:46.942]  We have a headline here out of CNBC.
[00:26:46.942 --> 00:26:52.843]  This chart shows there could be a real link between opioid use and people not working.
[00:26:52.843 --> 00:27:01.824]  Again, we have Trump announcing during the State of the Union that he wants the largest number of legal immigrants ever to take American jobs.
[00:27:01.824 --> 00:27:05.825]  Much of his base was up in arms about that, and rightly so.
[00:27:05.825 --> 00:27:11.506]  Many of the people who are out of work in America, there's a massive overlap with those who are basically hooked on opioids.
[00:27:13.587 --> 00:27:14.728]  The article reads, the U.S.
[00:27:14.728 --> 00:27:18.971]  opioid crisis is hitting the country on many fronts, including the labor market.
[00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:25.176]  States that prescribe more opioids per 100 people tend to have fewer people in their labor force.
[00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:32.962]  West Virginia, a state with one of the highest opioid prescription rates in the country in 2015, had the lowest labor force participation rate in 2018 at 54%.
[00:27:32.962 --> 00:27:33.142]  Alabama
[00:27:37.395 --> 00:27:44.684]  The state with the highest prescription rate has a participation rate of 57%, which is also one of the lowest.
[00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:51.391]  So they've found a direct correlation between people hooked on opioids and not being in the labor force.
[00:27:51.391 --> 00:27:53.113]  Will anyone address this issue?
[00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:56.177]  I know that Andrew Yang, who is running as a Democrat,
[00:27:56.818 --> 00:28:09.205]  Basically, on small donations, he's got no real chance of getting on the big debate stage, because he's not part of the Democratic Party establishment, is bringing up this issue time and time again, and rightly so.
[00:28:09.205 --> 00:28:16.769]  Trump covered it at the start of his presidential term in office, but he hasn't really spoken about it much since.
[00:28:16.769 --> 00:28:17.690]  Article continues.
[00:28:18.783 --> 00:28:27.621]  In turn, states like Minnesota and Colorado have two of the highest labor force participation rates, along with low opioid prescription levels.
[00:28:28.533 --> 00:28:31.876]  Opioid overdose-related deaths have skyrocketed in recent years.
[00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:39.282]  Between 1999 and 2017, those deaths rose six-fold, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:46.248]  And in my video, The Collapse of Western Civilization, which we're going to play later in the show, I document, again, it's not just prescription drugs.
[00:28:46.248 --> 00:28:50.932]  You can basically look at any drug, including heroin abuse, MDMA, marijuana,
[00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:59.010]  People are more hooked than ever, and people are more depressed than ever, and again, that has a direct correlation to the jobs market.
[00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.654]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.380]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.301]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:10.842]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:29:10.842 --> 00:29:13.803]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:29:13.803 --> 00:29:19.365]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:29:19.365 --> 00:29:20.566]  I can help you too.
[00:29:20.566 --> 00:29:23.507]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:29:23.507 --> 00:29:25.728]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:29:25.728 --> 00:29:30.170]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.510]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:35.287]  Maybe not today.
[00:29:35.287 --> 00:29:36.568]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:29:36.568 --> 00:29:40.310]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.391]  Forget bunkers.
[00:29:41.391 --> 00:29:43.212]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:29:43.212 --> 00:29:44.933]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:52.718]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[00:29:52.718 --> 00:29:53.738]  Bold statement?
[00:29:53.738 --> 00:29:54.719]  You bet.
[00:29:54.719 --> 00:29:57.221]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[00:29:57.221 --> 00:29:59.422]  That's survivalistcamps.com.

[00:30:04.915 --> 00:30:07.416]  I've got some really good news, though.
[00:30:07.416 --> 00:30:08.796]  X2's back.
[00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:10.557]  The original X2.
[00:30:10.557 --> 00:30:13.458]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:14.558]  What you want.
[00:30:14.558 --> 00:30:15.658]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:15.658 --> 00:30:17.099]  It'll be here in a week.
[00:30:17.099 --> 00:30:18.659]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:19.619]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:22.560]  With the best iodine in the world, X2, it's available.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.561]  I thought X3's great.
[00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:25.761]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[00:30:25.761 --> 00:30:27.582]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[00:30:27.582 --> 00:30:28.922]  The scientists that do that.
[00:30:28.922 --> 00:30:30.743]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:35.945]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[00:30:35.945 --> 00:30:40.027]  We now have X2 again, and in fullworkstore.com, so hallelujah!
[00:30:40.027 --> 00:30:51.733]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[00:30:51.733 --> 00:30:55.055]  You want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.
[00:30:55.055 --> 00:30:56.856]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[00:30:56.856 --> 00:30:58.877]  Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it.
[00:30:58.877 --> 00:31:00.338]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound.
[00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.081]  Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:13.484]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:13.484 --> 00:31:19.626]  Believe me, I know, I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:19.626 --> 00:31:24.868]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy.
[00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:28.569]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back
[00:31:28.969 --> 00:31:29.349]  We're good to go.
[00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.932]  Unleash the super male in you.
[00:32:00.932 --> 00:32:02.293]  Super Male Vitality.
[00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:04.975]  From inforestore.com.
[00:32:04.975 --> 00:32:08.438]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:08.438 --> 00:32:12.220]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.042]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water.
[00:32:15.042 --> 00:32:18.485]  And we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:18.485 --> 00:32:21.267]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:21.987 --> 00:32:25.788]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:25.788 --> 00:32:32.270]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.232]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:38.001 --> 00:32:41.924]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:41.924 --> 00:32:49.108]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:49.108 --> 00:32:53.811]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:53.811 --> 00:33:00.035]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:33:00.035 --> 00:33:03.998]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:07.931 --> 00:33:19.859]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.859 --> 00:33:22.121]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:33:22.121 --> 00:33:28.445]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.445 --> 00:33:32.168]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:33.892 --> 00:33:35.954]  We are live in Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.954 --> 00:33:38.116]  We'll be here in a third hour.
[00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:42.559]  We're going to go back to some more news and talk about Tucker Carlson here in this segment.
[00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:53.268]  But first, I want to direct you to infowarsstore.com, where for a limited time only, InfoWars select storable food products are available at up to 50% off.
[00:33:53.268 --> 00:33:56.010]  This is another huge discount.
[00:33:56.010 --> 00:34:00.534]  For a limited time only, we're giving you up to 50% off on our InfoWars select storable food line.
[00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:09.377]  At Infowarsstore.com, with all of the uncertainty in the world, it's never been so important to be prepared for a food emergency or empty shelves.
[00:34:09.377 --> 00:34:17.539]  Of course, FEMA, all these different government agencies routinely stockpile food for emergencies, so why shouldn't you?
[00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:25.841]  All of these Infowars select storable foods have a shelf life of 25 years and are made with super high quality ingredients in the USA.
[00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:31.453]  You compare these prices to storable food in the EU or in the UK.
[00:34:31.453 --> 00:34:33.194]  Absolutely no competition.
[00:34:33.194 --> 00:34:45.722]  The prices are so ridiculously good that you could save this for 20 odd years and then just eat it if nothing happens and save an absolute ton of money on groceries and on food.
[00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:49.004]  We don't know what's coming but we can always start preparing for tomorrow.
[00:34:50.806 --> 00:34:56.829]  50% off InfoWars Select Storable Food, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:32.062]  You can select a 60, 90, 180 day shipment so you don't have to keep reordering and forgetting to reorder.
[00:35:32.062 --> 00:35:37.764]  And of course there are many studies related to turmeric and the properties within it that
[00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:40.626]  Have to do with elevated mood.
[00:35:40.626 --> 00:35:48.476]  We don't make claims for that, but if you research the background of turmeric, again, a lot of studies relating to mood elevation.
[00:35:48.476 --> 00:35:51.160]  We sell it on the basis of joint support, mobility support.
[00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:55.799]  It's filled with powerful ingredients, including five different herbs and extracts.
[00:35:55.799 --> 00:36:02.965]  With these ingredients, BODYS is a true 360 win that can help you, again, with all those joint support, mobility support issues.
[00:36:02.965 --> 00:36:09.350]  It's available, it's back in stock, 50% off, just £29.95 for a 60-day supply.
[00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:14.374]  Available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:14.374 --> 00:36:15.835]  Now, I want to talk about Tucker Carlson.
[00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:23.588]  Because they're routinely trying to drag him down, to bring him down, because he is the most powerful voice on the right.
[00:36:23.588 --> 00:36:33.157]  They're absolutely incensed that he's held that primetime Fox News slot, that he still beats the likes of Rachel Maddow night after night after night.
[00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:34.798]  He is their ultimate target.
[00:36:34.798 --> 00:36:40.904]  I'm talking about Media Matters, I'm talking about George Soros, I'm talking about Sleeping Giants, all these advertiser boycotts.
[00:36:42.009 --> 00:36:53.238]  And basically they dug up some 10 to 15 year old jokes that he'd made on a radio show and they're trying to create a fake controversy about it, trying to pretend that they're all outraged and offended.
[00:36:53.238 --> 00:36:57.641]  And of course their primary and only goal is to get him kicked off the air.
[00:36:57.641 --> 00:37:00.664]  They don't care, they're not really outraged or offended.
[00:37:00.664 --> 00:37:02.905]  And they've said much worse.
[00:37:02.905 --> 00:37:09.891]  In fact, the very guy leading this witch hunt against Tucker Carlson, Media Matters President Angelo Carasone,
[00:37:11.172 --> 00:37:15.715]  Wrote blog posts about, quote, Japs, Jewry and Trannies.
[00:37:15.715 --> 00:37:21.119]  Nobody's calling for a boycott of him, nobody's calling for a boycott of Media Matters.
[00:37:21.119 --> 00:37:23.721]  This is what he wrote.
[00:37:23.721 --> 00:37:37.150]  Carisonia Media Matters, this is from the Daily Caller article, which openly pined for the destruction of Fox News, have justified the left-wing boycott campaign by pointing to a number of statements that Carlson made on a radio shock jock show between 2006 and 2011.
[00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:42.052]  So we're talking, you know, 8 to 15 years ago.
[00:37:42.052 --> 00:37:43.972]  I did a tweet on this yesterday.
[00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:50.673]  Retweet if you can give less of a damn about what Tucker Carlson joked about 10 years ago.
[00:37:50.673 --> 00:37:52.954]  Got something like 10,000 retweets.
[00:37:52.954 --> 00:38:00.536]  But if we're playing the game of who can be offended more, Karasone has his own track record of inflammatory statements.
[00:38:00.536 --> 00:38:06.537]  His now defunct blog included degrading references to trannies, jewellery and Bangladeshis.
[00:38:07.173 --> 00:38:17.276]  He posted one lengthy diatribe in November 2005 about a bangly-dusty man who was robbed by a gang of transvestites, as Carasone described it.
[00:38:17.276 --> 00:38:21.578]  He was offended that the gang was described as attractive in the article.
[00:38:21.578 --> 00:38:22.638]  And it goes on and on.
[00:38:22.638 --> 00:38:26.299]  I can't even read out some of this stuff on air, it's that ridiculous.
[00:38:26.299 --> 00:38:32.641]  But again, I don't care what he wrote ten years ago on his blog, but if they want to play that game, then we can play that game.
[00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.442]  We can talk about James Gunn.
[00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:49.266]  Let's now go to the Tucker Carlson clip from last night on his show in which he defended this Media Matters latest attack against him and called out the Media Matters founder for behaviour that was far worse.
[00:38:49.266 --> 00:38:50.728]  This is clip A. Let's roll it.
[00:38:51.613 --> 00:38:56.276]  That's when Hayes invited a man called Angelo Carusone onto his show.
[00:38:56.276 --> 00:38:58.398]  Carusone runs Media Matters.
[00:38:58.398 --> 00:39:04.361]  Almost every day, he issues outraged press releases accusing other people of bigotry.
[00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:11.246]  And yet, because everything is irony, Carusone is himself an enthusiastic bigot.
[00:39:11.246 --> 00:39:15.229]  We know this for sure because he has written about it extensively.
[00:39:15.229 --> 00:39:18.651]  It turns out that for years, Carusone maintained a racist blog.
[00:39:19.532 --> 00:39:24.734]  One post entitled, quote, Trainee Paradise addressed a crime story from Thailand.
[00:39:24.734 --> 00:39:29.915]  A Bangladeshi man had been robbed and assaulted by a group of male prostitutes dressed as women.
[00:39:29.915 --> 00:39:37.178]  Karasone objected to the idea that this was even a story and ridiculed South Asians as inherently ugly and poor.
[00:39:37.178 --> 00:39:37.498]  Quote,
[00:39:38.178 --> 00:39:40.819]  Is the writer a tranny lover, too?
[00:39:40.819 --> 00:39:46.042]  Or perhaps he's just trying to justify how these trannies tricked this Bangladeshi in the first place.
[00:39:46.042 --> 00:39:48.863]  Look, man, we don't need to know whether or not they were attractive.
[00:39:48.863 --> 00:39:51.244]  The effing guy was Bangladeshi!
[00:39:51.244 --> 00:39:54.266]  What the hell was he doing with $7,300 worth of stuff?
[00:39:54.266 --> 00:39:55.666]  The guy's Bangladeshi!
[00:39:55.666 --> 00:39:58.068]  End quote.
[00:39:58.068 --> 00:40:04.711]  In another post, Carusone described how a male coach at a Japanese high school had sexually abused female players.
[00:40:04.711 --> 00:40:07.252]  People in Japan were horrified by this, understandably.
[00:40:07.873 --> 00:40:08.933]  Karasone was not.
[00:40:08.933 --> 00:40:12.794]  His advice, quote, lighten up, Japs!
[00:40:12.794 --> 00:40:19.815]  Later that month, Karasone, by now in a frenzy of racism, heaped praise on a former Ku Klux Klan leader.
[00:40:19.815 --> 00:40:28.617]  In still another post from the same period, Karasone described a Jewish man as being handsome, quote, despite his jewelry.
[00:40:28.617 --> 00:40:36.879]  Karasone didn't like the man's political views, but attributed them to, quote, his possession of several bags of Jewish gold, end quote.
[00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:39.932]  Jewish gold.
[00:40:39.932 --> 00:40:44.357]  According to Angela Carusone, Jewish gold is a problem.
[00:40:44.357 --> 00:40:47.401]  Media Matters probably ought to issue a press release about this.
[00:40:47.401 --> 00:40:50.504]  They've done a lot more for a lot less.
[00:40:50.504 --> 00:40:55.710]  And yet somehow, this is the remarkable part, Chris Hayes managed to pretend that none of this ever happened.
[00:40:56.528 --> 00:40:59.329]  Hayes never mentioned the Jewish gold.
[00:40:59.329 --> 00:41:08.714]  He never said a word about the Japs, or the Trannies, or the Klan, or even those dirty Bangladeshis who deserve what they get no matter what the Tranny lovers say.
[00:41:08.714 --> 00:41:09.334]  None of that.
[00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:13.877]  Instead, Hayes gave cover to Carusone's bigotry and antisemitism.
[00:41:13.877 --> 00:41:19.399]  Amazingly, he even directed his viewers to Carusone's website.
[00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:24.202]  Angela Corcoran, of course, all that can be found at Media Matters' website, so you can listen to the full clips, get the full context.
[00:41:26.027 --> 00:41:26.487]  Right.
[00:41:26.487 --> 00:41:28.148]  Pretty amazing.
[00:41:28.148 --> 00:41:35.091]  If a guy with a history of ranting about Jewish gold came on your show, would you ask him about it?
[00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:36.692]  Would you challenge him on it?
[00:41:36.692 --> 00:41:37.672]  How could you not?
[00:41:37.672 --> 00:41:39.693]  You'd feel morally obligated.
[00:41:39.693 --> 00:41:41.014]  But Chris Hayes didn't.
[00:41:41.014 --> 00:41:41.754]  That tells you a lot.
[00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:50.177]  Now, to be clear, we're not calling for either of these people to be imprisoned or executed or even fired from their high-paying jobs.
[00:41:50.177 --> 00:41:53.537]  We're not planning to organize an advertiser boycott against them.
[00:41:53.537 --> 00:41:56.058]  We won't picket their offices with bullhorns.
[00:41:56.058 --> 00:41:58.438]  We won't attack their children.
[00:41:58.438 --> 00:42:00.979]  But we do think you should know what they're actually like.
[00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:04.159]  And in Chris Hayes' case, it's kind of depressing to find out.
[00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:06.460]  Turns out you really never know who people are.
[00:42:08.658 --> 00:42:19.661]  So there's Tucker Carlson defending himself against the latest witch hunt organised by Media Matters, the George Soros funded outfit Media Matters, which they continually deny, even though it's literally in the New York Times.
[00:42:19.661 --> 00:42:23.082]  George Soros gives one million dollars to Media Matters.
[00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:31.244]  Now this Angelo Carusone guy, also you have the narrative on the left, which is the right hates journalists and wants to physically attack journalists.
[00:42:31.244 --> 00:42:32.965]  Well that's kind of embarrassing for him.
[00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:46.660]  Because in a tweet, he tweeted at two Breitbart reporters and said, quote, he was plenty strong enough to kick your butt if you mouthed off like that in person instead of from the comfort of Randy's armpit.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:56.306]  So this guy, Angelo Carusone, is on Twitter physically threatening journalists while the left-wing media has this big narrative about the right-wing hating journalists.
[00:42:56.306 --> 00:42:58.547]  Was he, was his verified tick taken away?
[00:42:58.547 --> 00:42:59.808]  Was he suspended by Twitter?
[00:42:59.808 --> 00:43:00.648]  No, nothing happened.
[00:43:01.095 --> 00:43:03.816]  We'll be back to talk about it more on the Alex Jones Show live info walls.org.
[00:43:03.816 --> 00:43:09.578]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:43:09.578 --> 00:43:11.039]  So I need to make them strong now.
[00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:12.799]  Now I can be there for my children.
[00:43:12.799 --> 00:43:14.640]  Now I can make them strong.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.280]  Now I can instruct them.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.801]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:19.121]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:24.223]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:43:24.223 --> 00:43:29.844]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:43:29.844 --> 00:43:33.465]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:43:33.465 --> 00:43:34.505]  I can't be destroyed now.
[00:43:34.505 --> 00:43:39.847]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[00:43:39.847 --> 00:43:44.888]  As long as you bind yourself to something, and commit to it, and go through the fire
[00:43:45.328 --> 00:43:49.109]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:56.711]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:43:56.711 --> 00:44:03.333]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:44:04.438 --> 00:44:09.281]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:09.281 --> 00:44:18.186]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:18.186 --> 00:44:23.530]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:44:34.036 --> 00:44:35.097]  We're good to go!

[00:46:54.957 --> 00:46:57.498]  Perk up with TurboForce at Infowarestore.com.
[00:47:07.461 --> 00:47:10.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.543 --> 00:47:24.932]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.932 --> 00:47:28.634]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:55.032]  So the head honcho at Media Matters, the guy who led the witch hunt campaign against Tucker Carlson, is the same guy who wrote things far worse than anything Tucker Carlson ever joked about when he talked about Japs, Jews and trannies, talked about Angelo Carusone, also in a tweet, threatened physical violence against other journalists because they disagreed with him.
[00:47:55.032 --> 00:47:56.732]  Now we have this headline out of Newsweek.
[00:47:57.566 --> 00:48:02.730]  Tucker Carlson could face hate speech charges if he were Canadian or British.
[00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:14.439]  So basically, in other words, if we were in crappy countries like Canada and Britain where no First Amendment exists, we could lock up our political enemies.
[00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:15.980]  That's basically what they're saying here.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:25.487]  Fox News personality Tucker Carlson has faced growing calls to resign after racist and sexist comments he made 15 years ago, which no one cares about.
[00:48:25.487 --> 00:48:26.868]  On a radio show several years ago,
[00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:38.949]  And they asked a lawyer, David Butt, about what would happen to Tucker Carlson if he had said these things in Canada or the United Kingdom.
[00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:45.355]  He said that these remarks could constitute hate speech, which under the country's criminal code can be considered a chargeable offence.
[00:48:46.457 --> 00:48:48.599]  Why are they even writing this news article?
[00:48:48.599 --> 00:48:50.301]  Tucker Carlson is American.
[00:48:50.301 --> 00:48:52.763]  The statements he made were said in America.
[00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.765]  They were broadcast in America.
[00:48:54.765 --> 00:49:04.695]  This entire article is basically, oh, if only we didn't have a First Amendment like Canada doesn't, or like the United Kingdom doesn't, then we could lock him up.
[00:49:04.695 --> 00:49:09.860]  The absolute authoritarianism implicit in this article is beyond belief.
[00:49:11.337 --> 00:49:12.538]  This lawyer continues.
[00:49:12.538 --> 00:49:18.180]  Could these conversations in terms of their content qualify as hate speech under Canadian legislation?
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:19.321]  Again, who cares?
[00:49:19.321 --> 00:49:20.341]  It's not in Canada.
[00:49:20.341 --> 00:49:21.682]  He didn't say it in Canada.
[00:49:21.682 --> 00:49:23.503]  It wasn't broadcast in Canada.
[00:49:23.503 --> 00:49:25.203]  Yes, they could.
[00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:30.406]  On their face, it's not difficult to see that when you're calling somebody pigs and whores as a class, that's hateful.
[00:49:31.118 --> 00:49:45.924]  So they literally want to turn insults into hate speech and have you locked up for insults, not even targeting their precious protected groups of people in some cases, just targeting your political enemies, which is kind of ironic.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:54.904]  Because then you have the guy leading the charge against Tucker Carlson literally doing that and threatening physical violence against other journalists.
[00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:57.525]  Let's go to this Caitlin Bennett report now.
[00:49:57.525 --> 00:50:02.748]  How the left wants to ban Tucker Carlson and why it's a bigger issue than just media matters.
[00:50:02.748 --> 00:50:04.329]  Here it is.
[00:50:04.329 --> 00:50:06.070]  The left-wing mob is at it again.
[00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.691]  And their target this time?
[00:50:07.691 --> 00:50:09.652]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:50:14.873 --> 00:50:21.000]  The Democratic Psycho fans have set their eyes on a new target that they hope to turn into another Alex Jones.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.905]  And they won't stop until he is completely taken off the air and de-platformed.
[00:50:25.905 --> 00:50:31.891]  For months now, the left has religiously preyed on his every word in hopes of stirring up outrage amongst their mob.
[00:50:31.891 --> 00:50:35.155]  And unfortunately, they've been quite successful in doing so.
[00:50:37.532 --> 00:50:42.515]  Tucker has become such a target for the left for one reason and one reason only.
[00:50:42.515 --> 00:50:45.757]  Because he is an unapologetic Trump supporter.
[00:50:45.757 --> 00:50:48.399]  And he supports President Trump's immigration policies.
[00:50:49.036 --> 00:50:56.140]  Since the left has been unsuccessful in taking down Trump, they see taking down his supporters as the next best thing.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:06.107]  This is why they've become hostile towards anyone with a MAGA hat, and have gone as far as making run-of-the-mill conservatives feel unwelcome and unsafe in public.
[00:51:06.107 --> 00:51:11.190]  So to the left, since the number one rated cable news host is a Trump supporter,
[00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:14.571]  They have to do everything to try to take him out.
[00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:23.833]  According to TheWrap.com, Carlson's audience this year is not only larger than his direct competitions, it is larger than anything in the 8 p.m.
[00:51:23.833 --> 00:51:25.453]  hour on all of cable.
[00:51:25.453 --> 00:51:31.895]  And yes, that includes ESPN, HGTV, and everything else.
[00:51:31.895 --> 00:51:36.936]  Letting a Trump supporter become the most watched name in news is totally unacceptable to the left.
[00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:42.966]  So their goal now is to make sure he is left with no audience to spread the president's message.
[00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:50.513]  Enter Media Matters, the trustworthy Soros-funded fake news outlet that exists for the sole purpose of defaming conservatives.
[00:51:50.513 --> 00:51:59.681]  The sad little communist rag orchestrated a calculated attack against Carlson this week that has led to another full-fledged ambush on the Fox News host.
[00:52:00.001 --> 00:52:10.967]  Keep in mind that this is the same exact outlet that lied about me saying I put InfoWars on computers in an Apple store because of quote, Apple's racism against white.
[00:52:10.967 --> 00:52:15.709]  I explicitly said I did this because of their censorship of Alex Jones.
[00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:20.792]  Watch this video and you tell me if you think there's any credibility to Media Matters' accusation.
[00:52:21.971 --> 00:52:24.172]  So I heard that Apple banned Alex Jones and Anthro Wars from their iTunes store.
[00:52:24.172 --> 00:52:25.273]  We just wanted to leave them with a little gift.
[00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:27.395]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly the most important broadcast I've ever done in my life.
[00:52:47.842 --> 00:52:56.108]  So now that we've established what kind of credibility this outlet has, none, we can understand what their intentions are with Tucker.
[00:52:56.108 --> 00:53:07.175]  Someone from the website combed through 13 years worth of content from Tucker Carlson to unearth a comment he made in 2006 when he called into someone else's radio show.
[00:53:07.175 --> 00:53:08.356]  Going through 13 years.
[00:53:08.356 --> 00:53:08.636]  13 years!
[00:53:11.613 --> 00:53:15.637]  Worth of someone's content to dig up something they said is not journalism.
[00:53:15.637 --> 00:53:16.597]  It's malicious.
[00:53:16.597 --> 00:53:22.182]  There are accusations against him, but he made numerous misogynistic and perverted comments.
[00:53:22.182 --> 00:53:25.785]  And oh no, he called prostitutes slutty.
[00:53:25.785 --> 00:53:37.075]  Even though Media Matters gets seven times less web traffic than us here at InfoWars.com, the left-wing mob didn't care a thing about the credibility of their source or their reputation.
[00:53:37.688 --> 00:53:47.071]  They instead saw it as an opportunity to attack a prominent Trump supporter and posture themselves as being morally superior to their right-wing counterparts.
[00:53:47.071 --> 00:53:53.312]  When in fact, we know the left has no standards, no credibility, and no moral compass.
[00:53:53.312 --> 00:53:59.774]  Their only guidance is that whatever conservative support is bad and whatever the left supports must be good.
[00:54:00.394 --> 00:54:09.200]  What's more concerning to Media Matters' hit piece on Carlson is how the left-wing media ate it up and is doing everything they can to ruin his public image.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:18.225]  In fact, if you Google Tucker Carlson, you will find no favorable articles and will instead be bombarded with hit piece after hit piece from left-wing outlets.
[00:54:18.812 --> 00:54:24.858]  You'll see articles from the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Slate, and Stephen Colbert.
[00:54:24.858 --> 00:54:32.104]  In fact, the very first thing that shows up when you search his name is an article from the Washington Post titled, Tucker Carlson needs to go.
[00:54:32.104 --> 00:54:33.625]  Now.
[00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:40.792]  On Twitter, the hashtag Fire Tucker Carlson was trending for days and hit pieces on him were pushed to the top of everyone's feed.
[00:54:41.372 --> 00:54:51.359]  Despite the endless number of conservatives coming to Carlson's defense, strangely only the hit pieces on him are the ones showing up in search engines and on social media.
[00:54:51.359 --> 00:55:02.806]  And you would think that since Carlson makes a living by putting his face on a camera, and is the most watched television personality, that his clips on Fox might come up when you search his name on YouTube, right?
[00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:04.187]  Wrong!
[00:55:04.187 --> 00:55:09.252]  The top search results are instead hits on Tucker from CBS, MSNBC, and CNN.
[00:55:09.252 --> 00:55:19.242]  The fact that a video with a mere 511 views is the top result when you search his name is all the proof you need that big tech companies are pushing an agenda.
[00:55:19.242 --> 00:55:24.387]  If you've been following outlets like InfoWars and Project Veritas, this should come as no surprise.
[00:55:24.967 --> 00:55:32.994]  Since Big Tech's left-wing bias has been on full display for years now, and Google has been known to skew search results to favor left-wing sources.
[00:55:32.994 --> 00:55:45.045]  So now, if you didn't already realize, it is abundantly clear that the media and the Big Tech firms are evidently working together to try to take down one of President Trump's biggest allies in the media.
[00:55:45.045 --> 00:55:50.010]  And they are giving him the exact same treatment that they gave Alex Jones.
[00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:56.472]  Luckily for Carlson, conservatives aren't buying it this time, and are refusing to give in to the left-wing mob.
[00:55:56.472 --> 00:56:08.495]  Tucker took to Twitter to say, quote, Rather than express the usual witch-rule contrition, How about this?
[00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:11.716]  I'm on television every weeknight, live for an hour.
[00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:14.157]  If you want to know what I think, you can watch.
[00:56:14.837 --> 00:56:18.901]  Anyone who disagrees with my views is welcome to come on and explain why.
[00:56:18.901 --> 00:56:23.444]  Tucker knows better than anyone that the left-wing mob has no principles.
[00:56:23.444 --> 00:56:27.848]  These are the same people that tried to break into his home and harass his family.
[00:56:27.848 --> 00:56:31.131]  Where was the left-wing media to denounce the violence against Carlson?
[00:56:31.491 --> 00:56:37.493]  Where were they to stand up for him when the agitators called his teenage daughter a whore in public?
[00:56:37.493 --> 00:56:42.654]  Where were they to defend him from baseless accusations that he assaulted a gay Latino man?
[00:56:42.654 --> 00:56:47.736]  Just like every other incident of harassment against a conservative, the left was completely absent.
[00:56:48.136 --> 00:56:52.618]  If it weren't for double standards, the left wouldn't have any standards at all.
[00:56:52.618 --> 00:56:56.920]  If we don't stand together now against the mob, they will be coming for us next.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:02.602]  If they will come after innocent teenagers for wearing red hats, they won't hesitate to come after anyone.
[00:57:02.602 --> 00:57:06.344]  And they want the biggest name in television to be the first domino to fall.
[00:57:08.428 --> 00:57:15.952]  What will happen instead is they will only make Tucker Carlson more popular and make the ever-growing MAGA movement bigger than ever.
[00:57:15.952 --> 00:57:27.657]  The media is so scared of seeing Trump get re-elected in 2020 that they have destroyed all of their credibility in the process and instead assured that Trump will win in a huge landslide in 2020.
[00:57:27.657 --> 00:57:30.019]  Are you ready to keep America great?
[00:57:30.019 --> 00:57:30.279]  I am.
[00:57:33.323 --> 00:57:34.044]  There you have it.
[00:57:34.044 --> 00:57:37.126]  That's why they want to bring down Tucker Carlson.
[00:57:37.126 --> 00:57:38.807]  He refuses to apologize.
[00:57:38.807 --> 00:57:43.870]  They want to replace him with some anodyne, boring, NPC Fox News commentator.
[00:57:43.870 --> 00:57:47.373]  Thankfully, Fox News have stood behind him, which is the right decision.
[00:57:47.373 --> 00:57:51.496]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show, live at Infowars.com.
[00:57:51.496 --> 00:57:51.996]  Don't go away.
[00:57:54.056 --> 00:57:57.317]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:57:57.317 --> 00:58:00.319]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:58:00.319 --> 00:58:07.201]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:58:07.201 --> 00:58:08.322]  X2 is back.
[00:58:08.322 --> 00:58:09.122]  We got it.
[00:58:09.122 --> 00:58:10.783]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:58:10.783 --> 00:58:12.383]  We rushed it into production.
[00:58:12.383 --> 00:58:13.164]  It's been bottled.
[00:58:13.164 --> 00:58:15.145]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:58:15.145 --> 00:58:18.726]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from
[00:58:18.766 --> 00:58:19.366]  We're good.
[00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:40.534]  The good halogens and what you have the bad halogens at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:40.534 --> 00:58:41.774]  That's the umbrella site.
[00:58:41.774 --> 00:58:42.534]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:42.534 --> 00:58:44.555]  Takes you right to the supplements.
[00:58:44.555 --> 00:58:47.716]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:47.716 --> 00:58:49.657]  It is X2 Original.
[00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:55.118]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:55.118 --> 00:58:58.219]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[00:58:58.219 --> 00:58:59.760]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:59:01.377 --> 00:59:04.082]  That's what I'm talking about at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:08.130]  With InfoWare Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[00:59:09.705 --> 00:59:18.853]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:59:18.853 --> 00:59:24.217]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:59:24.217 --> 00:59:26.479]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:30.002]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[00:59:30.002 --> 00:59:31.483]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:59:31.483 --> 00:59:33.585]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies.
[00:59:34.165 --> 00:59:37.668]  Weak emergency supplies, they've got so many great products there.
[00:59:37.668 --> 00:59:39.209]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:41.210]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.732]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:59:43.732 --> 00:59:48.736]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:59:48.736 --> 00:59:58.483]  InfoWareStore.com, InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods, powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:59:58.483 --> 01:00:01.185]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:09.809 --> 01:00:11.050]  You found it!
[01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:13.091]  The tip of the sphere!
[01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:16.092]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:16.092 --> 01:00:22.255]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[01:00:22.255 --> 01:00:26.217]  We are into the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:26.217 --> 01:00:36.262]  Later on in the next hour, I'm going to play an extremely crucial video called The Collapse of Western Civilization, which went up last night, which I encourage everyone to share.
[01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:38.583]  We'll get to that later in the next segment.
[01:00:39.705 --> 01:00:41.005]  First I want to go to this headline.
[01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:44.686]  We've had this entire narrative about Trump supporters are going to attack the media.
[01:00:44.686 --> 01:00:47.807]  They're begging for some kind of violent attack on the media.
[01:00:47.807 --> 01:00:50.388]  They will exploit the heck out of that.
[01:00:50.388 --> 01:00:53.168]  Now I have this headline out of Information Liberation.
[01:00:53.168 --> 01:00:58.369]  Dems push Journalist Protection Act to make attacking journos a federal crime.
[01:00:58.369 --> 01:01:04.831]  So they're trying to put journalists in a special category of people because we don't exalt them enough already.
[01:01:05.868 --> 01:01:13.336]  So if you violently attack them, and in many senses not even violently attack, that's going to get you much longer jail time.
[01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:19.862]  It says democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill to make attacking or attempting to attack a journalist a federal crime.
[01:01:19.862 --> 01:01:25.408]  Now bear in mind that these people on the left think that mean words are violence.
[01:01:25.408 --> 01:01:29.132]  They literally try to recategorize mean words as being violent.
[01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:39.602]  From the Hill, three Democratic lawmakers reintroduced the Journalist Protection Act that intends to designate certain attacks on those reporting the news as a federal crime.
[01:01:39.602 --> 01:01:43.646]  And they're doing it in response to President Trump's climate of extreme hostility.
[01:01:43.646 --> 01:01:48.630]  Bear in mind that Washington Post's CNN is currently facing lawsuits of what, $250 million?
[01:01:50.822 --> 01:01:55.665]  For their national demonization campaign of the Covington High School students.
[01:01:55.665 --> 01:02:02.109]  You had CNN literally send reporters to dox old ladies and accuse them of being Russian bots.
[01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:05.290]  But no, it's Trump supporters who are to blame.
[01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:09.553]  So now they're trying to make this a federal hate crime to attack a journalist.
[01:02:10.276 --> 01:02:20.063]  Text says that anyone who intentionally commits or attempts to commit bodily injury to a journalist shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for three to six years.
[01:02:20.063 --> 01:02:25.066]  Again, when it happens the other way, you know, they either ignore it or they support the actual perpetrator.
[01:02:25.066 --> 01:02:27.948]  We saw Rand Paul violently, viciously attacked.
[01:02:27.948 --> 01:02:30.650]  They tried to bury that under the carpet.
[01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:34.392]  So now they're trying to make journalists a special class of people.
[01:02:34.392 --> 01:02:39.876]  So, quote, violent attacks against them are punishable by elongated prison sentences.
[01:02:39.876 --> 01:02:40.076]  Again,
[01:02:41.097 --> 01:02:42.117]  We just had Newsweek.
[01:02:42.117 --> 01:02:44.419]  I read the article before the break.
[01:02:44.419 --> 01:02:52.685]  They're talking about, oh what a shame it is that we can't push hate speech charges against Tucker Carlson because he's not Canadian or British.
[01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:56.987]  Their definition of hate speech at this point is disagreeing with them.
[01:02:56.987 --> 01:02:59.729]  That's basically what it's come down to.
[01:02:59.729 --> 01:03:04.132]  Meanwhile Facebook and Instagram suffer most severe outage ever.
[01:03:04.132 --> 01:03:06.474]  Facebook yesterday was down for 14 hours.
[01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:12.250]  Absolutely pathetic for a major company.
[01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:16.031]  And again, another sign that monopolies are horrible, bad news.
[01:03:16.031 --> 01:03:20.573]  They had Oculus, they had Facebook, they had Instagram, they had WhatsApp.
[01:03:20.573 --> 01:03:23.514]  All go down, Facebook for 14 hours.
[01:03:23.514 --> 01:03:29.437]  How on earth are they all on the same backbone where if you attack one, they all go down at the same time?
[01:03:29.437 --> 01:03:33.058]  Again, monopolies, they're only as strong as their weakest link.
[01:03:33.058 --> 01:03:36.800]  BBC News reports, Facebook appears to be recovering.
[01:03:37.341 --> 01:03:43.445]  From more than 14 hour disruption to all of its products which left them mostly inaccessible across the world.
[01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:48.509]  They came out and did a tweet at the start of this and denied that it was a denial of service attack.
[01:03:48.509 --> 01:03:50.911]  And then basically said nothing about it.
[01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:56.935]  The downtime was double or more their previous longest outage which was back in 2008.
[01:03:56.935 --> 01:03:58.456]  That's when they had 150 million users.
[01:03:58.456 --> 01:03:59.917]  Now they've got 2.3 billion users.
[01:04:02.936 --> 01:04:06.939]  How embarrassing was it for Facebook to be down for 14 hours?
[01:04:06.939 --> 01:04:11.182]  And how much does it tell us that these monopolies need to be broken up?
[01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:14.664]  Talking about breaking up monopolies, this is a suggestion that I've made before.
[01:04:14.664 --> 01:04:17.286]  I made it again on Twitter yesterday.
[01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:22.149]  Why isn't Trump sending at least one message a day on a competing social media network?
[01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:23.929]  Why is it all on Twitter?
[01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:26.390]  Why is he giving Twitter his content?
[01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:30.572]  Why is he drawing all the attention to Twitter, giving them credibility?
[01:04:30.572 --> 01:04:38.296]  Why does he not just send one message a day on a competing social network that's not controlled by Silicon Valley, like Parler?
[01:04:38.296 --> 01:04:40.737]  It would force all his haters to sign up.
[01:04:40.737 --> 01:04:42.898]  It would force all the media to sign up.
[01:04:42.898 --> 01:04:45.299]  It would force his entire base to sign up.
[01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.280]  You would not need an executive order
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:56.093]  And then that would give that platform credence to be an alternative competing network to networks like Twitter and Facebook, which we haven't had so far.
[01:04:56.093 --> 01:04:58.597]  That needs to be seriously considered.
[01:04:58.597 --> 01:05:00.900]  This is the Alex Jones Show, LiveInfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.381]  We'll be back.
[01:05:03.684 --> 01:05:08.410]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:39.862]  It is the Infowars store mega sale at infowarsstore.com Now this is a video which I put together over the past few days.
[01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:41.203]  It went up live last night and
[01:07:41.798 --> 01:07:46.821]  Basically talking about how all the precursors to how civilizations collapse.
[01:07:46.821 --> 01:07:51.343]  Civilizations on average collapse once every 336 years.
[01:07:51.343 --> 01:07:52.964]  Well, long overdue.
[01:07:52.964 --> 01:08:03.109]  And many of the preconditions for the collapse of a civilization, as studied by authors and historians and academics, have already been met in the West.
[01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:04.349]  This is absolutely chilling.
[01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:06.911]  This is the collapse of Western civilization.
[01:08:06.911 --> 01:08:07.291]  Here it is.
[01:08:08.336 --> 01:08:12.157]  Great civilizations are always the architect of their own downfall.
[01:08:12.157 --> 01:08:18.600]  Historian Arnold Toynbee studied 28 different great civilizations and found the same pattern.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.761]  Great civilizations commit suicide.
[01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:24.442]  Anne Glynn Jones spent nine years studying
[01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:24.922]  We're good to go.
[01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:42.176]  The end is nigh.
[01:08:42.176 --> 01:08:45.317]  More Americans than ever are dying from drug overdoses.
[01:08:45.317 --> 01:08:53.059]  Gun violence, car crashes or AIDS never killed as many Americans in a single year as overdoses did in 2017.
[01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:55.740]  But the issue isn't just prescription drugs.
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:04.002]  In the UK, so much cocaine is flushed into the rivers that endangered eels are becoming hyperactive and not reaching sexual maturity.
[01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:13.967]  The number of 16 to 24 year olds using coke, ecstasy, crystal meth and LSD doubled in just a two-year period from 2016 to 2018.
[01:09:13.967 --> 01:09:18.290]  In the US, heroin abuse has skyrocketed over the past 15 years.
[01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:25.053]  The number of people who used MDMA, marijuana and other drugs also consistently climbed over the last decade.
[01:09:25.053 --> 01:09:26.874]  Alcoholism is on the rise.
[01:09:26.874 --> 01:09:27.755]  One in eight
[01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:30.496]  White Americans is now an alcoholic.
[01:09:30.496 --> 01:09:38.598]  And when it comes to taking antidepressants, white rural communities have overtaken African American communities for the first time ever.
[01:09:38.598 --> 01:09:41.859]  Depression levels in America are the highest ever measured.
[01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:44.380]  Suicide rates are higher than ever.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:52.522]  Despite all our technology, our entertainment, our consumerism, our chemical enhancements, we're more miserable than ever before.
[01:09:52.782 --> 01:09:57.184]  Our existential dread is more pronounced than ever before.
[01:09:57.184 --> 01:10:05.466]  Educational, intellectual and material ease has manifested civilizational malaise and a lack of transcendent purpose.
[01:10:05.466 --> 01:10:13.569]  The result of this lack of transcendent purpose is self-destruction, not merely on a personal but on a population scale.
[01:10:13.569 --> 01:10:18.671]  Technical sophistication has been accompanied by mass incompetence in the arts,
[01:10:19.611 --> 01:10:24.092]  When a society has no purpose to believe in, it self-immolates.
[01:10:24.092 --> 01:10:32.934]  There's only so far that quasi-religious devotion to yoga, Starbucks pumpkin spiced lattes, and Whole Foods kale shakes can go.
[01:10:32.934 --> 01:10:38.255]  The latest iPhone can only distract you from the nagging voice of conscience for so long.
[01:10:38.255 --> 01:10:41.956]  Endlessly consuming products will never satiate the soul.
[01:10:42.176 --> 01:10:46.798]  We live in the ruins of a civilization that has lost faith in itself.
[01:10:46.798 --> 01:10:56.741]  A civilization that is constantly lectured it must be ashamed of itself and slowly subverted and destroyed from within as the only form of repentance.
[01:10:56.741 --> 01:11:01.643]  And if you're wondering how we wound up in the dark age we're currently living through, this is how we did.
[01:11:02.398 --> 01:11:05.022]  This is why important science is no longer being conducted.
[01:11:05.022 --> 01:11:06.905]  This is why art isn't being made.
[01:11:06.905 --> 01:11:08.347]  This is why comedy is dying.
[01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:12.713]  It's why people aren't thinking for themselves anymore, which means the end of creativity.
[01:11:12.713 --> 01:11:17.500]  Great civilizations collapse when the insatiable greed for sensual stimulation
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.465]  Outweighs the urge for any kind of private or social responsibility.
[01:11:22.465 --> 01:11:24.247]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:30.814]  French author Michel Houellebecq predicted both the rise of Islamism across Europe and the emergence of the Yellow Vest Movement.
[01:11:30.814 --> 01:11:37.841]  As Theodore Dalrymple writes about the themes of Houellebecq's novels, the vacuity of modern life in the West, its lack of transcendence,
[01:11:37.841 --> 01:11:38.382]  We're good to go.
[01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:57.725]  Which, however, no more than distracts.
[01:11:57.725 --> 01:11:59.788]  And where is the church in all this?
[01:11:59.788 --> 01:12:04.315]  Where are the firebrands railing against the vulgarity of modernity?
[01:12:04.315 --> 01:12:07.340]  Affiliation with the Church of England is at a record low.
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.384]  Just 2% of young people are affiliated.
[01:12:10.584 --> 01:12:17.426]  And in the US alone, the Christian population decreased by nearly 8% between 2007 and 2014.
[01:12:17.426 --> 01:12:24.649]  We're bulldozing churches and building ugly, gigantic, glassy monuments to insipid vacuity.
[01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:31.852]  Great civilizations collapse when they experience a rapid and enduring loss of population and identity.
[01:12:31.852 --> 01:12:37.313]  The number of babies born to Muslims is expected to surpass those born to Christians between 2030 and 2035.
[01:12:38.834 --> 01:12:44.078]  Muslim fertility remains high while Christians are literally dying out.
[01:12:44.078 --> 01:12:50.422]  Meanwhile, the global leader of the Catholic Church is the biggest cheerleader for his own flock's decline.
[01:12:50.422 --> 01:12:55.025]  If only there was a religious leader who understood the peril that we're in.
[01:12:55.025 --> 01:12:58.047]  We're worried about the Western world.
[01:12:58.047 --> 01:13:00.970]  What worries you?
[01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:03.832]  You know, the biggest worry is that Europe
[01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:14.242]  He no longer wants, or has lost the meaning of his origins.
[01:13:14.242 --> 01:13:15.243]  He has lost his roots.
[01:13:15.243 --> 01:13:18.685]  Or a tree that has no roots.
[01:13:18.685 --> 01:13:19.045]  He dies.
[01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:23.228]  And I'm afraid that the West is dying.
[01:13:23.228 --> 01:13:24.168]  There are many signs.
[01:13:24.168 --> 01:13:24.368]  You see?
[01:13:24.368 --> 01:13:26.330]  Many signs.
[01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.810]  No more birth.
[01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.870]  And...
[01:13:36.147 --> 01:13:37.949]  And where are conservatives in all this?
[01:13:53.024 --> 01:14:07.443]  Giving giant corporations huge tax breaks so they can import vast quantities of people from the third world and then pay them slave wages, while white Americans addicted to opioids live lives of atomized, nihilistic hopelessness.
[01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.047]  Is that conservatism?
[01:14:10.047 --> 01:14:10.608]  At this point,
[01:14:11.255 --> 01:14:12.997]  What exactly are we conserving?
[01:14:12.997 --> 01:14:14.759]  Those GDP numbers though!
[01:14:14.759 --> 01:14:23.911]  Is it conservative to allow Amazon to pay zero dollars in taxes on 11.2 billion dollars on profit for 2018?
[01:14:23.911 --> 01:14:29.618]  And for progressives, so long as Jeff Bezos virtue signals the right identity politics,
[01:14:30.279 --> 01:14:31.320]  Who cares, right?
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:37.764]  Great civilizations collapse when the economy serves not to elevate, but to denigrate the population.
[01:14:37.764 --> 01:14:40.065]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:14:40.065 --> 01:14:50.051]  Our entire economy has become centered around a crony capitalist system that eviscerates the family, leading to atomization, misery, and depression.
[01:14:50.872 --> 01:15:00.845]  In 2015, a study by the decidedly non-conservative Brookings Institution found that falling male wages caused about a quarter of the decline in marriage rates over the past 35 years.
[01:15:00.845 --> 01:15:08.555]  Two years later, MIT researchers found that when factories close, marriage rates go down and single parenthood becomes more common.
[01:15:09.155 --> 01:15:14.617]  That, as you could guess, causes a higher proportion of children to wind up on drugs or in prison.
[01:15:14.617 --> 01:15:15.957]  So it's not a small thing.
[01:15:15.957 --> 01:15:21.639]  And by the way, many other studies have reached the same conclusions over long periods of time.
[01:15:21.639 --> 01:15:22.499]  This is real.
[01:15:22.499 --> 01:15:29.021]  As French philosopher Eric Zemmour outlines, the elite have stopped caring about native populations.
[01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:29.741]  Why?
[01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:35.563]  Because those populations no longer tolerate stagnant wage growth and diminished job prospects.
[01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:39.766]  Simply to enslave themselves as a servant class for the elite.
[01:15:39.766 --> 01:15:42.867]  That's why they're on the streets rioting.
[01:15:42.867 --> 01:15:49.051]  So far easier... Okay, that is the collapse of Western Civilization Part 1.
[01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:54.915]  Part 2 is coming up after the break and we're getting some more breaking news here on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:15:54.915 --> 01:15:56.596]  InfoWars.com.
[01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:57.477]  Don't go away.
[01:15:57.477 --> 01:15:57.977]  We'll be back.
[01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:08.186]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:08.186 --> 01:16:11.227]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:11.227 --> 01:16:17.149]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:20.930]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:22.210]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.551]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:23.551 --> 01:16:29.752]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.173]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:31.773 --> 01:16:33.674]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:36.897]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[01:16:36.897 --> 01:16:38.498]  Savory and delicious.
[01:16:38.498 --> 01:16:41.340]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.000]  Awesome.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.082]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:45.082 --> 01:16:46.643]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:47.264]  Bacon.
[01:16:47.264 --> 01:16:51.426]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[01:16:51.426 --> 01:16:52.867]  Or warm and served.
[01:16:52.867 --> 01:16:54.909]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[01:16:54.909 --> 01:16:56.870]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:59.632]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:16:59.632 --> 01:17:00.933]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:17:01.953 --> 01:17:03.915]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:17:03.915 --> 01:17:09.239]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:09.239 --> 01:17:10.820]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:19.167]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:24.871]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:26.873]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:26.873 --> 01:17:29.135]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:29.135 --> 01:17:33.538]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:33.538 --> 01:17:35.740]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:43.467]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:17:48.328 --> 01:17:51.349]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or HBextract.com.
[01:17:51.349 --> 01:17:53.309]  I've got some really good news though.
[01:17:53.309 --> 01:17:54.009]  X2's back!
[01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:11.373]  The Original X2 Deep Earth Crystal Pure Atomic Iodine.
[01:18:11.373 --> 01:18:12.474]  What you want.
[01:18:12.474 --> 01:18:13.595]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:13.595 --> 01:18:15.036]  It'll be here in a week.
[01:18:15.036 --> 01:18:16.577]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[01:18:16.577 --> 01:18:17.538]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:17.538 --> 01:18:19.359]  With the best iodine in the world.
[01:18:19.359 --> 01:18:20.500]  X2, it's available.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.481]  I thought X3 is great.
[01:18:21.481 --> 01:18:23.682]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[01:18:23.682 --> 01:18:25.503]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[01:18:25.503 --> 01:18:26.844]  The scientists that do that.
[01:18:26.844 --> 01:18:28.666]  It's sold a lot, but people want Original X2.
[01:18:29.486 --> 01:18:33.868]  Well, I was resigned to the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[01:18:33.868 --> 01:18:37.949]  We now have X2 again, and in fullworkstore.com, so hallelujah!
[01:18:37.949 --> 01:18:49.673]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[01:18:49.673 --> 01:18:52.974]  You want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.
[01:18:52.974 --> 01:18:54.775]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:18:54.775 --> 01:18:56.795]  Learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it.
[01:18:56.795 --> 01:18:58.256]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound.
[01:18:59.278 --> 01:19:03.081]  Get yours today at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:16.511]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:16.511 --> 01:19:27.559]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:19:28.855 --> 01:19:30.777]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:30.777 --> 01:19:34.801]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:34.801 --> 01:19:39.165]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:19:39.165 --> 01:19:43.088]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:19:43.088 --> 01:19:45.691]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:45.691 --> 01:19:47.072]  This country is in a war!
[01:19:48.001 --> 01:19:58.690]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:05.996]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsTore.com, thank you!
[01:20:05.996 --> 01:20:08.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.775 --> 01:20:18.398]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:18.398 --> 01:20:23.525]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:34.392 --> 01:20:41.957]  We're back, and without further hesitation, let's go to part two of The Collapse of Western Civilization.
[01:20:41.957 --> 01:20:44.339]  This video is up on YouTube right now.
[01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:45.159]  Please get it out there.
[01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:47.081]  Here is part two.
[01:20:47.081 --> 01:20:53.605]  As French philosopher Eric Zemmour outlines, the elite have stopped caring about native populations.
[01:20:53.605 --> 01:20:54.325]  Why?
[01:20:54.325 --> 01:21:04.112]  Because those populations no longer tolerate stagnant wage growth and diminished job prospects, simply to enslave themselves as a servant class for the elite.
[01:21:04.352 --> 01:21:07.434]  That's why they're on the streets rioting.
[01:21:07.434 --> 01:21:13.718]  So far easier for the elite just to replace them with robots and a third world slave class.
[01:21:13.718 --> 01:21:19.001]  Great civilizations collapse when the supply of labor outstrips demand.
[01:21:19.001 --> 01:21:20.682]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:25.424]  Great civilizations collapse when wealth inequality runs rampant.
[01:21:25.424 --> 01:21:27.045]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:21:27.045 --> 01:21:33.088]  Great civilizations collapse when the elite debases the currency to hide financial problems.
[01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:34.729]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:37.951]  And the Democratic Party, for whatever reason, is not trying to address those problems.
[01:21:38.411 --> 01:21:49.564]  They're attacking Trump himself or the symptoms, but the disease is this pervasive economic insecurity as we make it harder and harder for Americans to find meaningful opportunities.
[01:21:49.564 --> 01:21:55.170]  Great civilizations collapse when the building block of society, the family unit,
[01:21:55.797 --> 01:21:57.578]  Crumbles into dust.
[01:21:57.578 --> 01:21:59.379]  We're now reaching this point.
[01:21:59.379 --> 01:22:07.764]  While Muslims in the West unite to rally around protection of their children, we treat ours like an unwanted medical waste product.
[01:22:07.764 --> 01:22:20.030]  While Muslims in the West refuse to allow their kids to be indoctrinated with warped sexual propaganda, we dress up ours as drag queens, parade them on television, and demand everyone embrace it as normal.
[01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:21.271]  It's not normal.
[01:22:21.611 --> 01:22:24.915]  There's something deeply wrong with what we've become.
[01:22:24.915 --> 01:22:31.863]  Now for all its barbarity, at least Islam provides its adherents with some sense of meaning and fulfillment.
[01:22:31.863 --> 01:22:34.005]  Time to join the winning team!
[01:22:34.005 --> 01:22:35.087]  Allahu Akbar!
[01:22:35.087 --> 01:22:36.248]  Allahu Akbar!
[01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:45.851]  The Mayan civilization collapsed when the Spanish invasion inflicted upon it a foreign culture intent on spreading its own systems of faith and governance.
[01:22:45.851 --> 01:22:47.912]  Beginning to notice any parallels?
[01:22:47.912 --> 01:22:58.796]  Historically, the movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting to unravel.
[01:22:59.076 --> 01:23:05.021]  Okay, and you can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art.
[01:23:05.021 --> 01:23:06.422]  Okay, you can see it happening.
[01:23:06.422 --> 01:23:21.756]  All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome, nude, young men athletes that used to be very robust, okay, in the archaic period, suddenly begin to seem like wet noodles, okay, toward the end.
[01:23:21.756 --> 01:23:25.599]  And that the people who live in such periods, the late phase of culture,
[01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:40.202]  Whether it's the Hellenistic era, whether it's the Roman Empire, whether it's the Mauve decade of Oscar Wilde in the 1890s, whether it's Weimar Germany, people who live in such times feel that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan.
[01:23:40.202 --> 01:23:42.164]  Homosexuality, heterosexuality, so what?
[01:23:42.164 --> 01:23:42.845]  Anything goes.
[01:23:44.646 --> 01:23:51.009]  But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer believes in itself.
[01:23:51.009 --> 01:24:00.493]  And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power of heroic masculinity.
[01:24:00.493 --> 01:24:10.658]  On the edges, whether they're the vandals and the Huns, or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS, you see them starting to mass on the outsides of the culture.
[01:24:10.658 --> 01:24:11.558]  And that's what we have right now.
[01:24:11.758 --> 01:24:13.659]  What does our culture provide?
[01:24:13.659 --> 01:24:17.782]  A tedious drip-drip of anodyne lethargic dross?
[01:24:17.782 --> 01:24:22.885]  Or at the other end of the spectrum, a sewer pipe of obscene, tawdry hedonism?
[01:24:22.885 --> 01:24:24.886]  What does our society provide?
[01:24:24.886 --> 01:24:28.308]  A lifestyle of never talking to or knowing your neighbours?
[01:24:28.308 --> 01:24:30.029]  Of aborting your babies?
[01:24:30.029 --> 01:24:31.650]  Of cheating on your wives?
[01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:35.252]  A lifestyle of desperately searching for the next dopamine hit?
[01:24:35.572 --> 01:24:40.594]  Whether that be from an Instagram-like, a pharmaceutical drug, or a new gadget.
[01:24:40.594 --> 01:24:52.738]  A lifestyle of strip malls, five-lane traffic, f***ing recycled pop songs, f***ing recycled movies, f***ing recycled NPC celebrities all spouting the same opinions.
[01:24:52.738 --> 01:24:59.541]  Our art may become so degenerate that future generations will be completely uninterested in it.
[01:24:59.541 --> 01:25:00.161]  And I'm sorry,
[01:25:00.621 --> 01:25:09.871]  But my free market capitalism just doesn't cut it anymore as a purposeful credo to unite and fortify Western civilization.
[01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:16.698]  It takes much more than an increasingly unjust economic system to maintain a civilization.
[01:25:16.698 --> 01:25:18.961]  Which is why the enemies are at the gates.
[01:25:19.361 --> 01:25:20.762]  Waiting to take over.
[01:25:20.762 --> 01:25:25.323]  Which is why socialist vulture demagogues are busy licking their lips.
[01:25:25.323 --> 01:25:29.925]  We've abandoned the enlightenment values that built Western civilization.
[01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:35.046]  We've abandoned the idea that family is fundamental to community strength and happiness.
[01:25:35.046 --> 01:25:39.928]  We've abandoned high culture in favor of lowbrow junk culture.
[01:25:39.928 --> 01:25:45.150]  We've abandoned stoic strength of character in favor of chemical dependence.
[01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:50.534]  We labour under an economic and political system that has abandoned us.
[01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:53.636]  We collectively killed God.
[01:25:53.636 --> 01:25:57.079]  We're left with nothing authentic to believe in.
[01:25:57.079 --> 01:25:58.860]  That's why everyone's on drugs.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.882]  That's why everyone's nihilistic.
[01:26:00.882 --> 01:26:03.043]  That's why everyone's unhappy.
[01:26:03.043 --> 01:26:03.824]  What's the solution?
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.841]  There is no solution.
[01:26:06.841 --> 01:26:12.846]  Every great civilization collapses, on average, every 336 years.
[01:26:12.846 --> 01:26:23.114]  And the collapse of ours is very much overdue.
[01:26:23.114 --> 01:26:26.877]  That is the collapse of Western Civilization.
[01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:28.518]  YouTube video available right now.
[01:26:28.518 --> 01:26:32.742]  It's got about 330,000 views overnight, so it seems to be going viral.
[01:26:32.742 --> 01:26:34.183]  A lot of people resonating with that.
[01:26:35.129 --> 01:26:38.111]  And in connection with that, we have a headline here out of Breitbart.
[01:26:38.111 --> 01:26:39.692]  Fertility falls in EU.
[01:26:39.692 --> 01:26:43.995]  Not one country hits population replacement level.
[01:26:43.995 --> 01:26:45.776]  I've talked about this many times before.
[01:26:45.776 --> 01:26:55.223]  You have a situation in major European cities like Frankfurt, like Antwerp, where immigrants are now the majority of the population.
[01:26:55.223 --> 01:27:00.446]  In Antwerp, Belgium, which is Belgium's most populous city, 52% of the population
[01:27:04.844 --> 01:27:07.265]  Or migrants.
[01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:15.708]  Problem being is that 90% of those migrants vote for either left-wing or far left-wing parties.
[01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:24.791]  This is precisely why the elite are now importing their servant slave class and by and large that's a democratic party movement but it's also a kind of
[01:27:25.743 --> 01:27:30.786]  Koch Brothers movement to bring in cheap labor so we get crushed in the vice and everybody loses.
[01:27:30.786 --> 01:27:37.429]  They vote for left-wing parties, they vote for parties who want bigger government, that's why they import the voting bloc.
[01:27:37.429 --> 01:27:45.974]  Now total births in the European Union's 28 member states in 2017 has fallen from the year before, while first-time mothers are now almost 30.
[01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:50.876]  So mothers are getting older, they're having less babies in Europe, throughout Europe.
[01:27:50.876 --> 01:27:51.477]  Which is why
[01:27:52.939 --> 01:28:12.209]  In Hungary, Viktor Orban introduced this policy where he gave newborn mothers $35,000 to every woman, this is women who marry, every woman under 40 who marries for the first time and that loan is completely written off after the birth of her third child.
[01:28:12.209 --> 01:28:18.793]  Women who raise four or more children are now exempt from paying income tax for life in Hungary.
[01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.214]  Now a lot of people on the right are going to say, oh my god, that's socialism.
[01:28:21.869 --> 01:28:29.295]  No it's not, that's economic nationalism, that's building up your own population, that's basic survival.
[01:28:29.295 --> 01:28:43.187]  Meanwhile in Europe, figures released by Eurostat on Tuesday revealed that there were 5.075 million babies born in the Union, that's less than the year before, or 5.148 million, with a total fertility rate of 1.59 births per woman.
[01:28:45.541 --> 01:28:47.723]  Again, that's down on the year before.
[01:28:47.723 --> 01:28:52.989]  And well short of 2.1 births per woman needed to maintain a population.
[01:28:52.989 --> 01:28:55.432]  We're literally dying out in the next segment.
[01:28:55.432 --> 01:28:58.415]  I'll talk about what exactly we're being replaced with.
[01:28:58.415 --> 01:28:58.795]  Join us.
[01:28:58.795 --> 01:29:00.096]  It's InfoWars.com.
[01:29:00.096 --> 01:29:00.517]  We'll be back.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:03.300]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.221]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:07.221 --> 01:29:08.762]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:08.762 --> 01:29:11.723]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:11.723 --> 01:29:17.284]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:17.284 --> 01:29:18.485]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:18.485 --> 01:29:21.405]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:21.405 --> 01:29:23.646]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:23.646 --> 01:29:28.087]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:28.087 --> 01:29:29.427]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:37.731]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[01:29:38.380 --> 01:29:43.081]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[01:29:43.081 --> 01:29:45.382]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[01:29:45.382 --> 01:29:48.182]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[01:29:48.182 --> 01:29:51.623]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[01:29:51.623 --> 01:29:53.923]  Together we'll recapture America.
[01:29:53.923 --> 01:29:55.224]  Call 1-877-383-4777 or visit theofficialflag.com.
[01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:56.064]  theofficialflag.com
[01:30:13.123 --> 01:30:14.644]  And by bounds.
[01:30:14.644 --> 01:30:21.330]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:31.419]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:30:31.419 --> 01:30:39.926]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:30:42.691 --> 01:30:48.012]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:30:48.012 --> 01:30:48.492]  It's you!
[01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:14.326]  That has defeated Hillary and the Globalist.
[01:31:14.326 --> 01:31:23.028]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:31:23.028 --> 01:31:27.610]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:31:27.610 --> 01:31:29.050]  You are the info war.
[01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:32.591]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:31:37.537 --> 01:31:37.757]  I think?
[01:32:01.371 --> 01:32:02.732]  We are winning!

[01:33:05.937 --> 01:33:08.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:17.991]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.991 --> 01:33:19.292]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:33.218 --> 01:33:37.899]  So before the break we were talking about these new fertility rates coming out of Europe.
[01:33:37.899 --> 01:33:40.720]  The replacement rate is not being met.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:42.660]  It's 2.1 births per woman.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.861]  We're way below that in every European country.
[01:33:45.861 --> 01:33:52.083]  In terms of individual countries, France has the highest fertility rate at 1.9 births per woman.
[01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:56.564]  Now, my question is, do these births include newly arrived migrants?
[01:33:56.564 --> 01:33:58.344]  I'm presuming they do.
[01:33:58.344 --> 01:34:00.705]  So even with their births, which are way above
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.125]  What European native citizens are having.
[01:34:04.125 --> 01:34:07.310]  We have France at 1.9, followed by Sweden at 1.78, Ireland 1.77, UK's at 1.74, Spain is way down at 1.31.
[01:34:15.106 --> 01:34:23.311]  They're literally going to die out, which is interesting given that they had a socialist government swing into power last year and immediately opened the borders.
[01:34:23.311 --> 01:34:36.080]  Again, the argument is always, oh, we need mass immigration because we need workers, because we can't pay our pension obligations, even though the clear majority of those migrants in every case, both unskilled and skilled labor,
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.922]  Go on to welfare immediately!
[01:34:38.922 --> 01:34:41.905]  So they're taking out more from the system than they're putting in.
[01:34:41.905 --> 01:34:47.329]  So that argument that you need a huge labour force doesn't even make sense economically.
[01:34:47.329 --> 01:34:52.494]  Cyprus is down to 1.32, Greece 1.35, Portugal 1.38.
[01:34:52.494 --> 01:34:55.897]  So the replacement level is way below what it should be.
[01:34:55.897 --> 01:34:57.578]  We're literally dying out and being replaced.
[01:34:57.578 --> 01:35:00.561]  Being replaced by what?
[01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.883]  Let's look at what's happening in Germany once again.
[01:35:03.928 --> 01:35:05.389]  This is the headline out of Breitbart.
[01:35:05.389 --> 01:35:09.293]  Germany migrant crimes concealed to avoid stirring up prejudice.
[01:35:09.293 --> 01:35:17.801]  Authorities in a district of rural Germany covered up a long list of asylum seeker crimes including rape, assault and child sex abuse so as not to stir up prejudice.
[01:35:17.801 --> 01:35:19.383]  It has been alleged.
[01:35:19.383 --> 01:35:22.325]  This is not the first time we've seen this kind of report.
[01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:27.791]  We had the main German broadcaster ZDF come out two plus years ago
[01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:36.278]  And admit that they, as a television network, do not report on crimes committed by migrants.
[01:35:36.278 --> 01:35:47.627]  You have a situation in Germany where, even while these statistics are being covered up and depressed, there's been a 10% rise in violent crime.
[01:35:47.627 --> 01:35:50.309]  90% of that rise is attributable to migrants.
[01:35:50.309 --> 01:35:52.371]  Now, Trump came out about a year ago and said,
[01:35:53.371 --> 01:35:55.772]  Germany has a bigger problem with crime.
[01:35:55.772 --> 01:35:57.333]  Crime is rising in Germany.
[01:35:57.333 --> 01:36:00.935]  They came out and said, no, that's fake news, that's not true.
[01:36:00.935 --> 01:36:02.815]  Because they took all crime.
[01:36:02.815 --> 01:36:06.377]  Violent crime is rising and it's mostly attributable to migrants.
[01:36:06.377 --> 01:36:10.419]  Those are the statistics coming out from the German government, okay?
[01:36:10.419 --> 01:36:12.840]  Not a right-wing news source.
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:14.601]  So now internal police figures reveal
[01:36:16.355 --> 01:36:27.999]  117 criminal offences took place at refugee housing in Buestet, northern Germany during the last three months and that third world migrants housed in other accommodation in the municipality were listed as suspects in a further 23 crimes.
[01:36:27.999 --> 01:36:43.805]  But officers neglected to announce the incidents after orders from the Interior Ministry, that's the government, instructed police that active notifications from the Forces Press Office on potential migrant involvement in crimes would be, quote, irresponsible.
[01:36:44.531 --> 01:36:47.112]  And likely to stir up prejudice.
[01:36:47.112 --> 01:37:01.175]  We've had stories about this before where they literally say, the police say, we've been ordered to lie about migrant crime statistics because the government claims it's going to stir up civil unrest and riots amongst the German population.
[01:37:01.175 --> 01:37:05.836]  So they'd rather just hide it and leave victims wide open to abuse.
[01:37:05.836 --> 01:37:08.957]  An absolutely ridiculous situation.
[01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:12.058]  We had this article from back in February from Infowars.com
[01:37:13.169 --> 01:37:17.791]  German police lie about migrant crime statistics to preserve peace.
[01:37:17.791 --> 01:37:25.554]  German police officers hide the severity of migrant crime statistics in order to preserve civil peace, according to a recent news report.
[01:37:25.554 --> 01:37:40.400]  And that, again, talks to the police officers who say we're being directed by our superiors to literally bury and obfuscate migrant crimes in our reports when we file reports about rapes, about assaults, about violent crimes.
[01:37:41.084 --> 01:37:51.509]  Meanwhile, those who do commit the crimes of being treated with kid gloves, this is out of Breitbart, Syrian migrant murderer acquitted due to psychiatric illness caused by war trauma.
[01:37:51.509 --> 01:38:02.454]  This was a 24-year-old Syrian asylum seeker who stabbed his boss to death at work and was acquitted in a German court due to psychiatric issues caused by his past in Syria.
[01:38:03.058 --> 01:38:12.147]  So as long as you say that you've travelled through a war-torn country, apparently in Germany, that literally allows you to get away with murder.
[01:38:12.147 --> 01:38:20.555]  The Syrian was mentally disturbed and carried out the attack in an act of paranoid fit of rage, the Express reports.
[01:38:20.555 --> 01:38:26.020]  The 24-year-old apparently believed in various paranoid delusions before the murder, including that he was being secretly monitored and spied on.
[01:38:27.248 --> 01:38:38.898]  So he just claimed that because he'd been through a war-torn country and had mental problems that that made him viciously attack and murder his boss and he got away with murder.
[01:38:38.898 --> 01:38:45.463]  Meanwhile in Italy, Italian girl murdered by Nigerian migrants likely dismembered alive.
[01:38:45.463 --> 01:38:52.849]  Remember this was the 18-year-old girl who they found the body parts of literally in a suitcase on the side of the road.
[01:38:53.550 --> 01:39:07.301]  Well now Italian teen Pamela Mastropietro, who was murdered by migrant Nigerian mobsters last year, huge problem with Nigerian mobsters in Italy as we've spoken about before, was likely dismembered alive.
[01:39:07.301 --> 01:39:20.491]  The horrifying revelations come from the testimony of Vincenzo Marino, a key witness in the trial of Nigerian drug dealer Innocent Osagale, how ironic is that name, who stands accused of murdering the teenage girl.
[01:39:21.969 --> 01:39:30.052]  Mastropietro had become estranged from her family, became addicted to drugs after a brief relationship with a Romanian man her mother claims.
[01:39:30.052 --> 01:39:43.978]  And then Marino says that he overheard the Nigerian migrant mobster admit to the murder and admit that he dismembered the corpse while the 18-year-old girl was still alive from the feet up.
[01:39:46.624 --> 01:39:50.107]  This is the cultural enrichment we're experiencing throughout Europe.
[01:39:50.107 --> 01:39:57.114]  Italy has experienced a massive crime wave since the influx of hundreds of thousands of sub-Saharan migrants, particularly from Nigeria.
[01:39:57.114 --> 01:39:58.355]  Remember what Macron said?
[01:39:59.016 --> 01:40:11.084]  He wanted to turn France, he wanted to turn Europe into Eurabia by literally importing 150 million to 200 million Africans over the next 10-15 years.
[01:40:11.084 --> 01:40:19.110]  Meanwhile, 18-year-old Italian teenage girls are literally being dismembered alive and found in suitcases.
[01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:21.411]  Absolutely disgusting.
[01:40:21.411 --> 01:40:23.993]  This is the situation we're dealing with in Europe.
[01:40:23.993 --> 01:40:25.594]  This is what's coming to America.
[01:40:26.673 --> 01:40:28.734]  If you follow the same course.
[01:40:28.734 --> 01:40:32.875]  And now you see the video which I put up about a year ago now.
[01:40:32.875 --> 01:40:53.380]  We probably won't have time to play it, but as this is happening in Germany, as violent crime is on the increase, as people who commit vicious murders are being acquitted because they say they travel through war-torn countries, as the police are ordered to hide, bury the reports of violent crime, you have German television shows in their soap operas literally having
[01:40:54.156 --> 01:40:59.559]  White mothers convert their children to Islam and do Islamic prayers.
[01:40:59.559 --> 01:41:09.303]  You have models, white six-foot German women wearing hijabs saying embrace diversity as they dance around in hijabs.
[01:41:09.303 --> 01:41:18.688]  So while the population is being outright lied to, now you see the advert, enjoy difference, start tolerance, I think it was a UN-related advert that played on German television,
[01:41:19.497 --> 01:41:32.265]  While the media, while the police are being ordered to lie to the German population, they're simultaneously brainwashing them, indoctrinating them into Islamophilia.
[01:41:32.265 --> 01:41:46.195]  Because again, that's far easier than just facing up to the full scale of the problem that occurred after Angela Merkel invited some 2 million predominantly Muslim migrants into the country from 2015 onwards.
[01:41:46.195 --> 01:41:48.236]  And we went to Dresden, Germany
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:42:00.109]  As an Infowars crew back in 2016, to cover the Bilderberg Conference, but again, you talk to the locals, there was a refugee center nearby, and we saw it with our own eyes.
[01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:04.753]  The refugees would come out, hang around, congregate around the train station.
[01:42:04.753 --> 01:42:10.318]  The police would leave them alone, by and large, and then they would go out and literally harass teenage girls.
[01:42:10.318 --> 01:42:12.600]  I saw it with my own eyes.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:17.764]  The taxi drivers that we spoke to said that they were dealing drugs, that the crime in the area had increased.
[01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:26.197]  This is the cultural enrichment that Angela Merkel is to blame for, which is why she's got her lowest approval rating ever.
[01:42:26.197 --> 01:42:28.618]  This is the situation we're dealing with.
[01:42:28.618 --> 01:42:32.459]  Meanwhile, European mothers are not having babies.
[01:42:32.459 --> 01:42:37.200]  The fertility rate is not up to par, and it's a long, long way off.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:40.741]  That's why we need more policies like Orbán's introduced in Hungary.
[01:42:41.423 --> 01:42:48.906]  Where you literally pay people to get married, where you forgive them of income tax if they have four children.
[01:42:48.906 --> 01:42:50.646]  That's the medicine that we need.
[01:42:50.646 --> 01:42:55.788]  It's not socialism, it's basically protecting your own national heritage.
[01:42:55.788 --> 01:42:57.069]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:42:57.069 --> 01:42:59.650]  We'll be back to talk about Brexit in the next segment.
[01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:00.110]  Don't go away.
[01:43:02.077 --> 01:43:05.319]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[01:43:05.319 --> 01:43:08.302]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[01:43:08.302 --> 01:43:15.187]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[01:43:15.187 --> 01:43:16.347]  X2 is back.
[01:43:16.347 --> 01:43:17.128]  We got it.
[01:43:17.128 --> 01:43:18.789]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[01:43:18.789 --> 01:43:20.390]  We rushed it into production.
[01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:21.171]  It's been bottled.
[01:43:21.171 --> 01:43:23.993]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an
[01:43:24.053 --> 01:43:24.393]  We're good to go.

[01:45:02.717 --> 01:45:08.483]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:45:08.483 --> 01:45:09.945]  So I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:09.945 --> 01:45:11.707]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:45:11.707 --> 01:45:13.549]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:45:13.549 --> 01:45:15.190]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:16.912]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:45:16.912 --> 01:45:17.773]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:45:18.013 --> 01:45:23.134]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:23.134 --> 01:45:28.736]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:28.736 --> 01:45:32.376]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:45:32.376 --> 01:45:38.738]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[01:45:38.738 --> 01:45:43.999]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for
[01:45:44.219 --> 01:45:48.002]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:45:48.002 --> 01:45:55.628]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:45:55.628 --> 01:46:03.273]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.

[01:46:06.356 --> 01:46:07.897]  During the fall, so you'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:11.419]  We're good.
[01:46:17.848 --> 01:46:26.970]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:48:25.363 --> 01:48:33.931]  Now Donald Trump has come out and slammed the UK Prime Minister Theresa May, headlined Trump Brexit negotiation went badly.
[01:48:33.931 --> 01:48:37.194]  PM May didn't listen to my advice.
[01:48:37.194 --> 01:48:38.696]  He's basically come out and said
[01:48:40.433 --> 01:48:43.816]  He's surprised at how badly the Brexit negotiations have gone.
[01:48:43.816 --> 01:48:49.221]  He said he's surprised at how badly they've gone and that the EU is tearing the country apart.
[01:48:49.221 --> 01:48:54.366]  He says that Theresa May did not listen to his suggestions on how to handle the negotiations.
[01:48:54.366 --> 01:49:01.633]  You would have thought that the guy behind the art of the deal, one of the most successful businessmen of all time, would have had an input into Theresa May.
[01:49:01.633 --> 01:49:02.834]  No, she did not listen.
[01:49:04.767 --> 01:49:09.270]  Basically now Trump needs to openly say that the UK is not behaving like a democratic country.
[01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:11.731]  He needs to come out and make that kind of statement.
[01:49:11.731 --> 01:49:14.393]  That could force Theresa May's hand to honour Brexit.
[01:49:14.393 --> 01:49:15.854]  It could at least embarrass her.
[01:49:15.854 --> 01:49:17.815]  We'll take anything at this point.
[01:49:17.815 --> 01:49:20.636]  They voted to take no deal off the table.
[01:49:20.636 --> 01:49:25.459]  So now the EU knows that we have absolutely no cards.
[01:49:25.459 --> 01:49:27.580]  We're holding no cards whatsoever.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:29.942]  That worked in their favour once again.
[01:49:29.942 --> 01:49:31.743]  Now we have this headline out of Breitbart.
[01:49:32.863 --> 01:49:35.733]  Report EU plots two-year Brexit delay.
[01:49:35.733 --> 01:49:38.323]  Officials prepare for UK to join EU elections.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.462]  Again, this was designed to fail from the very beginning.
[01:49:41.462 --> 01:49:44.965]  We had a Remainer globalist cabinet pushing the deal.
[01:49:44.965 --> 01:49:53.392]  Theresa May, who voted Remain, not even going into the negotiations with a strong hand, deliberately, so she could get raked over the coals.
[01:49:53.392 --> 01:50:07.784]  Now the European Union is pushing for a lengthy extension of Britain's negotiations for Brexit, pushing the exit day well beyond March 29th, and leaving British officials to plan for Britain to participate in the European Parliamentary elections in May, if nothing has changed.
[01:50:08.837 --> 01:50:17.983]  Now if that happens you're going to get dozens of Nigel Farages running as MEPs and in fact I know some of them who are planning to do so.
[01:50:17.983 --> 01:50:26.349]  Labour Party, Conservative Party will both get absolutely walloped as they deserve because they're betraying Brexit.
[01:50:26.349 --> 01:50:31.893]  So they had a vote today on taking No Deal off the table, they had another vote on a second referendum
[01:50:32.566 --> 01:50:37.132]  We voted to leave the European Union nearly three years ago now.
[01:50:37.132 --> 01:50:38.333]  It hasn't happened.
[01:50:38.333 --> 01:50:44.641]  They've been pushing for this second referendum which would completely override the very notion of democracy.
[01:50:44.641 --> 01:50:46.523]  Now they had the losers vote today.
[01:50:46.523 --> 01:50:49.326]  Thankfully it failed by a wide margin.
[01:50:49.326 --> 01:50:51.529]  So at least that is off the table for now.
[01:50:52.583 --> 01:50:57.370]  Now we're going to have another vote in Parliament tonight to delay Brexit once again.
[01:50:57.370 --> 01:51:05.261]  They're going to try and kick the can down the road for as long as humanly possible and hope that everybody loses steam, that everybody loses motivation.
[01:51:06.525 --> 01:51:08.586]  We wait to see what happens.
[01:51:08.586 --> 01:51:10.106]  We have a headline here out of RT.
[01:51:10.106 --> 01:51:15.268]  No delay from EU or we elect 73 Nigel Farages into European Parliament.
[01:51:15.268 --> 01:51:17.488]  So that's basically what they're facing.
[01:51:17.488 --> 01:51:20.609]  Brexit, as I warned, was being betrayed from the start.
[01:51:20.609 --> 01:51:29.652]  Every European country that voted against the interests of the EU, the vote was done over and over again until they got the result they wanted.
[01:51:29.652 --> 01:51:30.172]  Because again,
[01:51:30.512 --> 01:51:39.314]  This is not a democratic institution, this is an authoritarian institution, and that's exactly why we need out of it.
[01:51:39.314 --> 01:51:42.015]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[01:51:42.015 --> 01:51:48.837]  Meanwhile, back in the US, one of the democratic candidates who I actually agree with on many issues is Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:51:48.837 --> 01:51:52.718]  She's the only one who is against the deep state war machine.
[01:51:52.718 --> 01:51:59.360]  Appeared on Stephen Colbert for a hostile interview, and we have that clip, we're going to roll it right now.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:51:59.780]  Here it is.
[01:52:01.156 --> 01:52:04.797]  I don't know whether America should be the policeman of the world.
[01:52:04.797 --> 01:52:06.677]  It is my opinion that we should not be.
[01:52:06.677 --> 01:52:20.480]  If we are not involved in international conflicts or trying to quell international conflicts, that might destabilize the world because the United States, however flawed, is a force for good in the world, in my opinion.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.440]  Would you agree with that?
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:22.581]  I do agree with that.
[01:52:22.581 --> 01:52:24.461]  My point is that
[01:52:25.834 --> 01:52:30.463]  In order to be a force for good, we must actually do good.
[01:52:31.821 --> 01:52:37.343]  The consequences of these regime change war policies has been horrible.
[01:52:37.343 --> 01:52:40.945]  It has been completely the opposite of that intention.
[01:52:40.945 --> 01:52:59.333]  The real question here that is important for us, the American people, and our government, is how destructive these regime change wars are on the people in the countries where we are supposedly trying to help them, as well as how destructive they are to us, the American people, here at home, both from a security perspective
[01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:11.031]  And the fact that we don't have enough money to pay for health care for everyone, that we don't have enough money to pay for education, to rebuild our infrastructure, the urgent needs that our people have right here at home.
[01:53:12.811 --> 01:53:20.315]  So every time Tulsi Gabbard goes on one of these shows, they savage her for supporting the butcher, the dictator Assad.
[01:53:20.315 --> 01:53:40.507]  She was one of the lone, reasonable, rational voices from the very beginning on the left, speaking out against regime change, against disastrous foreign intervention, against supporting ISIS in their war to topple Assad, which is exactly what we did in Iraq and basically created the rise of ISIS throughout the region.
[01:53:40.507 --> 01:53:41.808]  That's what we did in Libya,
[01:53:42.368 --> 01:53:49.256]  And she's attacked by Stephen Colbert, a guy that cut his teeth, a guy that rose to prominence by being the anti-war, anti-George W. Bush guy.
[01:54:04.051 --> 01:54:10.773]  Remember the famous White House press correspondence dinner, where he savaged George Bush over the war in Iraq?
[01:54:10.773 --> 01:54:26.239]  Now that Stephen Colbert has basically joined the Deep State, he's suddenly pro-war and pro-foreign intervention, just because a Republican is in office, just because a Republican in the form of Donald Trump is not going along with the war party.
[01:54:26.239 --> 01:54:32.081]  Absolute stunning hypocrisy and double standards from Stephen Colbert, but what do you expect?
[01:54:33.504 --> 01:54:36.645]  Meanwhile, there's a headline here out of the New York Post.
[01:54:36.645 --> 01:54:40.967]  Is this bearded hipster proof that all anti-conformists look alike?
[01:54:40.967 --> 01:54:43.388]  This is absolutely hilarious.
[01:54:43.388 --> 01:54:55.132]  MIT Technology Review published an article outlining the hipster effect, a phenomenon in which people, eager to define themselves away from the mainstream, all end up looking alike.
[01:54:55.132 --> 01:54:59.234]  Think ironic, facial hair, earthy flannels and craft brews in hand.
[01:55:00.197 --> 01:55:18.147]  So basically, this guy, they used a stock image of a hipster for this MIT Technology Review article, and an outraged man threatened legal action against the publication for using his image to illustrate the article, only to find out that the image was not of him.
[01:55:19.435 --> 01:55:26.640]  Thereby proving the entire point of the article, the entire point of the study, that all hipsters look alike.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:31.823]  The more they try to be non-conformist, the more they conform.
[01:55:31.823 --> 01:55:48.273]  It says the term hipster effect was originally coined by the mathematician Jonathan Tabool of Brandeis University, who used the Markov model, stochastic evolution and other theoretical statistics to prove his point, that anti-conformist individuals all look the same.
[01:55:48.917 --> 01:56:03.890]  So when this article came out, when he threatened legal action, they basically came back to this hipster and said, that's not you, it just looks like you, because all hipsters look the same, and you just proved our entire point.
[01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:05.251]  Meanwhile, not satire!
[01:56:05.251 --> 01:56:10.055]  Social Democrats want to integrate ISIS fighters with the help of radical mosques.
[01:56:10.055 --> 01:56:13.498]  This is out of, well, it's got to be Germany or Sweden, hasn't it?
[01:56:13.498 --> 01:56:15.460]  One of the two, and it's Germany in this instance.
[01:56:16.132 --> 01:56:27.038]  German Interior Minister Andreas Giesel of the SPD is currently checking if returning ISIS fighters can be integrated with the use of radical mosques in Berlin.
[01:56:27.038 --> 01:56:38.484]  So they're literally not only saying yes, fine, we'll accept, we'll readmit all these ISIS terrorists that literally beheaded people, come on in for a bit more cultural enrichment in Germany.
[01:56:38.484 --> 01:56:44.848]  They're now going to reintegrate them with the aid of other Islamists in radical mosques.
[01:56:46.107 --> 01:56:55.554]  Gunnar Schauplis, a journalist for the tabloid BZ, said that the proposal sounds like Geisel wants to use the arsonists to put out the fire.
[01:56:55.554 --> 01:57:04.521]  They're literally going to radical mosques, going to radical Islamists, and saying, you can help us reintegrate ISIS fighters into Germany.
[01:57:04.521 --> 01:57:06.162]  Completely insane.
[01:57:06.162 --> 01:57:12.627]  Meanwhile, woman told to cover up before flying out of diverse UK city of Birmingham, this was up on m4wars.com,
[01:57:13.504 --> 01:57:15.886]  Basically, it was a woman who wore a crop top.
[01:57:15.886 --> 01:57:22.692]  She got on a plane flying out of Birmingham, UK, where the population is 25% Muslim.
[01:57:22.692 --> 01:57:28.637]  Somebody, we don't know who, complained about it and said that this was not modest enough.
[01:57:28.637 --> 01:57:31.799]  So again, literally enforcing modesty culture.
[01:57:31.799 --> 01:57:36.123]  She was asked to leave the plane unless she covered up.
[01:57:37.029 --> 01:57:38.430]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:47.574]  Of course, nothing to do with the fact that 25% of the population of Birmingham is Muslim and 50,000 of the inhabitants don't even speak English.
[01:57:47.574 --> 01:57:50.136]  This is the Alex Jones Show, live at Infowars.com.
[01:57:50.136 --> 01:57:50.616]  We'll be back.
[01:57:51.878 --> 01:57:57.102]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:57:57.102 --> 01:58:05.670]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:08.632]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:58:08.632 --> 01:58:10.394]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:58:10.394 --> 01:58:16.659]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:58:18.738 --> 01:58:24.061]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:27.022]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:58:27.022 --> 01:58:30.624]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:58:30.624 --> 01:58:34.926]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:58:34.926 --> 01:58:36.747]  I've got two in my home.
[01:58:36.747 --> 01:58:42.850]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:43.671]  Don't live
[01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:48.585]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:58:48.585 --> 01:58:49.849]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:54.903]  Patriots are on the go.
[01:58:54.903 --> 01:58:59.626]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[01:58:59.626 --> 01:59:10.074]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:10.074 --> 01:59:14.237]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[01:59:14.237 --> 01:59:17.120]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[01:59:17.774 --> 01:59:21.515]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[01:59:21.515 --> 01:59:25.056]  No one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[01:59:25.056 --> 01:59:28.317]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.
[01:59:28.317 --> 01:59:37.941]  Secure your box of high-quality InfoWars Life protein bars today, and you will be impressed, and you will reorder them, and you will help fund the operation to break the Globalists back.
[01:59:37.941 --> 01:59:38.761]  It's up to you.
[01:59:38.761 --> 01:59:39.121]  It's easy.
[01:59:39.301 --> 01:59:41.143]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:01.952 --> 02:00:02.853]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:02.853 --> 02:00:04.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.671 --> 02:00:16.675]  I mean, the way they decided to de-platform Alex Jones was highly subjective.
[02:00:16.675 --> 02:00:17.675]  Very interpretive.
[02:00:17.675 --> 02:00:19.457]  And I've seen far worse conduct.
[02:00:19.457 --> 02:00:26.423]  I mean, for example, the Covington case, you had a prominent Hollywood figure show an image of saying the Covington kids should have to go through a shredder.
[02:00:26.423 --> 02:00:26.723]  Yeah.
[02:00:26.723 --> 02:00:27.604]  And be killed.
[02:00:27.604 --> 02:00:30.347]  You had Reza Aslan calling for them to be punched in the face.
[02:00:30.347 --> 02:00:31.047]  Yeah.
[02:00:31.047 --> 02:00:31.908]  Nothing was done about that.
[02:00:32.348 --> 02:00:38.413]  And yet, Alex Jones posts something that's just a funny video, and they're like, oh my goodness, we have to get rid of Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.413 --> 02:00:47.460]  Okay, so I want to spend a whole bunch of time on Covington, because I think actually that was the moment that this shifted, and maybe at a legal sense it crystallized in my mind a little bit more.
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:48.721]  That's actually when I reached out to you.
[02:00:48.721 --> 02:00:48.921]  Sure, yeah.
[02:00:48.921 --> 02:00:53.084]  Because I saw you just going for it, going for it, and I thought, okay, this is a conversation we have to have.
[02:00:53.084 --> 02:00:54.505]  But let's talk about Jones for a minute.
[02:00:55.826 --> 02:00:57.667]  You've done some defense work with Jones.
[02:00:57.667 --> 02:01:02.490]  Yes, I'm representing Alex Jones at InfoWars and now his outside general counsel on all these legal matters.
[02:01:02.490 --> 02:01:05.431]  So you represent him across the board on all of these things.
[02:01:05.431 --> 02:01:11.474]  So I guess my first question is what's it like when Alex Jones knocks on your door or calls you up?
[02:01:11.474 --> 02:01:14.576]  He's a very animated guy, very nice guy, very open, very sincere.
[02:01:14.576 --> 02:01:19.899]  What was fascinating is from the get-go he was saying 90% of what they're saying about me isn't the case.
[02:01:20.379 --> 02:01:26.404]  He's like, I would defend this on free speech and free press grounds anyway, but what they're actually saying, I said I didn't say.
[02:01:26.404 --> 02:01:31.327]  I never attacked these families, I never went after these families, I never told people to go to their families' homes, none of that.
[02:01:31.327 --> 02:01:34.009]  Yeah, so this is, that stuff specifically is about the Sandy Hook case.
[02:01:34.009 --> 02:01:35.230]  Exactly, the Sandy Hook case.
[02:01:35.230 --> 02:01:44.657]  And so they took a Media Matters video and assumed that's what I said and it wasn't really, and they took most of that out of context and didn't put in that I had corrected the record a long time ago.
[02:01:45.337 --> 02:01:50.119]  Um, and so part of it was, you know, very nice guy, actually very friendly guy, very accessible guy.
[02:01:50.119 --> 02:01:55.341]  Uh, even more so than Snipes, he gets mobbed when he goes out in public with people wanting selfies and that sort of thing.
[02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:57.822]  Um, and he doesn't act like the Jaguar did with the lady.
[02:01:57.822 --> 02:02:00.443]  He's very nice and sociable and friendly.
[02:02:00.443 --> 02:02:06.265]  Um, so he, uh, runs a, you know, nice small business enterprise, you know, access TV to talk radio to internet.
[02:02:06.265 --> 02:02:09.746]  And he's intended to be the poster boy of their deplatforming campaigns.
[02:02:10.927 --> 02:02:14.028]  What I told the press is this case really isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:02:14.028 --> 02:02:16.910]  It's about the ability of the independent press to operate.
[02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:24.754]  Will lawfare be discriminately or disparately used against ordinary individuals in the same way that deplatforming is happening already in the big tech space?
[02:02:24.754 --> 02:02:26.776]  And so are we going to protect the little guy or not?
[02:02:26.776 --> 02:02:29.097]  And Alex Jones, they figured, would be the convenient.
[02:02:29.097 --> 02:02:35.921]  They would sort of create a parody of him, a caricature of him, that they could get the public to believe, make the audience feel bad if they watch him.
[02:02:36.401 --> 02:02:37.322]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:57.297 --> 02:02:58.998]  They don't talk about a civil rights legacy.
[02:02:58.998 --> 02:03:00.900]  They don't talk about any of that.
[02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:09.285]  The whole thing is intended to smear him and to send a message that if you're a lawyer and you dare defend Alex Jones, we're going to try to destroy your reputation in the public space.
[02:03:09.285 --> 02:03:11.827]  And that's exactly the problem that needs to be fixed and remedied.
[02:03:13.727 --> 02:03:22.811]  Related to Jones specifically, I mean, one of the things that I thought was most incredible, I forget the exact order of it, but basically within 48 hours, all the platforms took him down.
[02:03:22.811 --> 02:03:23.112]  Yes.
[02:03:23.112 --> 02:03:33.857]  And it's like, okay, is that that you guys truly are calling each other and coordinating it, or is it that you're all sort of cowards, somebody breaks the ice and now you're just followers?
[02:03:33.857 --> 02:03:35.838]  And I don't know that it matters either way, right?
[02:03:35.838 --> 02:03:37.118]  It probably doesn't matter either way.
[02:03:37.118 --> 02:03:38.239]  But what I thought was, okay,
[02:03:38.843 --> 02:03:43.952]  It doesn't even matter what he has said, short of breaking an American law, in my opinion.
[02:03:43.952 --> 02:03:45.394]  The real issue here is that...
[02:03:46.949 --> 02:03:51.770]  If he can't be on there, then why is Farrakhan on there?
[02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:54.011]  I'm not making a direct comparison to them.
[02:03:54.011 --> 02:03:55.071]  Why is FAMAS on there?
[02:03:55.071 --> 02:03:57.372]  We could do a zillion other things, you know?
[02:03:57.372 --> 02:03:59.392]  The disparity is obvious and evident.
[02:03:59.392 --> 02:04:04.873]  There are people who have said far worse things, that just happen to have a different ideological or intellectual perspective.
[02:04:04.873 --> 02:04:11.595]  Even if you took all the accusations against them at face value, and 90% of them are not true, that's your typical smear campaign.
[02:04:11.595 --> 02:04:15.716]  The conservative, or the person on the right, or the person on the independent anti-war left,
[02:04:16.216 --> 02:04:17.977]  We'll often be attacked and smeared.
[02:04:17.977 --> 02:04:19.838]  90% of what's said about them is not true.
[02:04:19.838 --> 02:04:25.640]  But even if it was true, what the other side has said is usually far worse and far more egregious and far more excessive.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:27.321]  And it's the obvious disparate treatment.
[02:04:27.321 --> 02:04:37.905]  They're using their concentrated power, including their lawfare power, to effectively wipe out the little guy so that only the big guy's voice is heard.
[02:04:37.905 --> 02:04:39.306]  And ultimately it's about the audience.
[02:04:39.306 --> 02:04:40.906]  Because Alex Jones is still going to talk.
[02:04:40.906 --> 02:04:42.127]  It's just can the audience hear him?
[02:04:42.227 --> 02:04:44.068]  So it's about their right to choose.
[02:04:44.068 --> 02:04:49.790]  Their right to choose what news they want to look at, what views they want to have, how they filter information.
[02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:52.651]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:53.331]  X2's back.
[02:05:04.711 --> 02:05:09.374]  The Original X2 Deep Earth Crystal Pure Atomic Iodine.
[02:05:09.374 --> 02:05:10.474]  What you want.
[02:05:10.474 --> 02:05:11.595]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:05:11.595 --> 02:05:13.036]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:05:13.036 --> 02:05:14.577]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:05:14.577 --> 02:05:15.537]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:05:15.537 --> 02:05:17.358]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:05:17.358 --> 02:05:18.499]  X2 is available.
[02:05:18.499 --> 02:05:19.480]  I thought X3 is great.
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:21.681]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:05:21.681 --> 02:05:23.502]  But I thought add the other two types of iodine.
[02:05:23.502 --> 02:05:24.843]  The scientists that do that.
[02:05:24.843 --> 02:05:26.664]  It's sold a lot, but people want Original X2.
[02:05:27.484 --> 02:05:31.866]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:05:31.866 --> 02:05:35.948]  We now have X2 again, and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:05:35.948 --> 02:05:47.654]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:47.654 --> 02:05:50.976]  You want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.
[02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:56.259]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound.

[02:06:04.387 --> 02:06:07.028]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.028 --> 02:06:08.729]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.729 --> 02:06:13.310]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:14.211]  March 14th, 2019.
[02:06:14.211 --> 02:06:18.772]  We are right in the eyes of March right now.
[02:06:25.619 --> 02:06:29.845]  You know, I took President Trump to the metaphorical woodshed yesterday.
[02:06:29.845 --> 02:06:33.530]  And I didn't do it because I don't support the President.
[02:06:33.530 --> 02:06:37.095]  I didn't do it to get brownie points with Hillary Clinton.
[02:06:37.095 --> 02:06:40.119]  I did it because he's not defending the First Amendment.
[02:06:40.119 --> 02:06:42.382]  He's not standing up against big cartels.
[02:06:43.451 --> 02:06:55.339]  A big tech openly involved in organized racketeering against nationalists, against Christians, against conservatives, against Second Amendment groups, veterans groups, hunting, fishing groups, you name it.
[02:06:55.339 --> 02:07:01.244]  There is a reign of terror going on, and the President's saying, well, just be well-behaved.
[02:07:01.244 --> 02:07:02.865]  We've got to be better than the Democrats.
[02:07:02.865 --> 02:07:04.466]  That doesn't cut it.
[02:07:04.466 --> 02:07:05.927]  So I'll talk more about that coming up.
[02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:17.636]  In the next segment and we've got the latest AOC behavior where she's the gift that just keeps on giving until you realize the Democrats love all this BS.
[02:07:17.636 --> 02:07:20.557]  How socialism and communism are great now.
[02:07:20.557 --> 02:07:23.098]  Banks financing anything is inherently evil.
[02:07:23.098 --> 02:07:26.700]  We're going to be playing all this coming up in the next few segments.
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:30.561]  But first, let me get into President Trump yesterday.
[02:07:30.561 --> 02:07:32.682]  I'll play his comments here in a moment.
[02:07:32.682 --> 02:07:34.083]  Rounding the Boeing
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:39.761]  A new generation of 737s, the MAX 8 and the MAX 9.
[02:07:39.761 --> 02:07:43.562]  And crazily enough, we're gonna roll some of the B-roll here in a moment.
[02:07:43.562 --> 02:07:54.205]  I, for TV viewers, I flew back to the United States yesterday, and I'm on the plane looking at the internet on my phone as the President grounds the aircraft.
[02:07:54.205 --> 02:08:00.686]  And I look up, and it's got on the computer screen right there, with the in-flight announcements, that I'm on a MAX 737-800.
[02:08:05.089 --> 02:08:06.850]  Which I guess is the same as an eight or nine.
[02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:11.493]  The point is, as I said, is this the plane that's just been grounded?
[02:08:11.493 --> 02:08:14.314]  And they said, yes, but don't worry.
[02:08:14.314 --> 02:08:28.483]  The pilots say that it's just a autopilot problem and that they're not training these third world companies in Africa and in Asia, and that all they got to do is hit two buttons and the autopilot's off.
[02:08:28.483 --> 02:08:34.066]  That if they don't think the plane's going fast enough, the robot, the computer, basically
[02:08:35.612 --> 02:08:36.873]  First, put the nose down.
[02:08:36.873 --> 02:08:40.154]  And then if pilots fight it, they can't fight it, it'll take you all the way down.
[02:08:40.154 --> 02:08:44.675]  It tends to happen on takeoff at a certain point if the plane slows.
[02:08:44.675 --> 02:08:46.276]  I go, wow, how do you know all this?
[02:08:46.276 --> 02:08:51.018]  And he goes, well, I'm actually a pilot in private life working towards my commercial license.
[02:08:51.018 --> 02:08:55.639]  So then later out of chance, once we got off the plane real quick to talk to the pilot, he confirmed all that.
[02:08:55.639 --> 02:08:59.561]  But while I'm on the couple hour flight back to the U.S., I'm reading all the articles.
[02:09:00.234 --> 02:09:08.659]  Confirming that there's all these federal registry complaints and all these admissions by pilots that it's the autopilot and that it's super dangerous that even U.S.
[02:09:08.659 --> 02:09:18.804]  carriers didn't teach them in the last year when these planes rolled out that when the autopilot glitches with a bad sensor, you just turn the autopilot off.
[02:09:18.804 --> 02:09:21.145]  So pilots have all talked and figured this out.
[02:09:21.145 --> 02:09:24.567]  So when this happened five, six days ago, I already knew I bet it's autopilot.
[02:09:25.655 --> 02:09:30.116]  Because pilots are complaining that new pilots especially don't know how to fly planes.
[02:09:30.116 --> 02:09:37.578]  They may get their license, go through their hours, get trained, do simulators, do regional carriers, finally get on a big jet.
[02:09:37.578 --> 02:09:43.439]  Well, then a few years of flying around on these big jets with autopilot that's so incredibly good.
[02:09:43.439 --> 02:09:46.040]  You ever wonder why landings are so much smoother than they used to be?
[02:09:47.492 --> 02:09:51.015]  Remember when you were a kid, or even a teenager, if you're older, like I am, 45, 50, 60, 70?
[02:09:51.015 --> 02:09:55.899]  Remember, like, even on sunny days, clear skies, I mean, whoa!
[02:09:55.899 --> 02:09:56.960]  Boom, boom, boom!
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:00.943]  You ever wonder why it's just so damn smooth when you come in, like, pew, pew, pew?
[02:10:00.943 --> 02:10:04.205]  It's because the autopilot is amazing!
[02:10:04.205 --> 02:10:10.230]  The same autopilot they had in the 80s that could shoot cruise missiles down people's chimneys or through their windows!
[02:10:10.230 --> 02:10:14.354]  But what happens when it messes up, and the humans don't know what to do?
[02:10:14.354 --> 02:10:15.875]  And so, a lot of pilots have pointed out,
[02:10:16.678 --> 02:10:25.423]  This is criminal negligence that the manuals do not tell people what to do when this happens.
[02:10:25.423 --> 02:10:36.010]  So sure, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, things like Qantas, things, you know, top brand, things like Virgin, things like British Airways, Southwest has good pilots.
[02:10:36.010 --> 02:10:42.594]  They've all been taught about this workaround, this glitch in the autopilot sensor.
[02:10:42.594 --> 02:10:45.295]  But I made some calls when this first happened five days ago.
[02:10:45.295 --> 02:10:46.396]  People are like, oh, it's the autopilot.
[02:10:47.555 --> 02:10:53.058]  I called some pilots, and then sure enough, they're showing up with the news, but still the media is acting like, well, is it autopilot?
[02:10:53.058 --> 02:10:55.219]  So, the problem is the autopilot.
[02:10:55.219 --> 02:10:57.080]  We all know what's doing it.
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:12.507]  You just have to put the pilots through a training regimen, that if the plane is slowing down on takeoff, you know, at 6, 7, 8,000 feet, because you're ascending, if the plane thinks it's going too slow, it doesn't want to stall out, the computer drops the nose.
[02:11:12.507 --> 02:11:16.709]  Pilots start fighting that, the computer overrides, you're dead.
[02:11:17.811 --> 02:11:23.574]  And the pilots don't even know that it's an autopilot problem.
[02:11:23.574 --> 02:11:28.616]  Which, again, you go back 40-something years ago, Texas Instruments comes out with a calculator.
[02:11:28.616 --> 02:11:31.618]  Before then, everybody knew how to do arithmetic.
[02:11:31.618 --> 02:11:36.880]  The average person could do any type of algebra, any type of other equations you needed.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.462]  Hell, I was pretty good, because they wouldn't let us back in high school use calculators.
[02:11:40.462 --> 02:11:41.823]  I was okay at math.
[02:11:41.823 --> 02:11:45.405]  Nowadays, I don't know the first thing about math.
[02:11:45.405 --> 02:11:46.205]  I use a calculator.
[02:11:47.302 --> 02:11:50.323]  And again, the machines are making us weak.
[02:11:50.323 --> 02:11:52.103]  I'm not against the machines.
[02:11:52.103 --> 02:11:53.124]  It's just they're making us weak.
[02:11:53.124 --> 02:11:55.784]  And we always need a human there that knows how to run it.
[02:11:55.784 --> 02:11:59.665]  If the machine doesn't, that keeps humans the equation.
[02:11:59.665 --> 02:12:01.546]  And that's what I trust.
[02:12:01.546 --> 02:12:03.887]  And you take Trump had a great tweet on this.
[02:12:03.887 --> 02:12:04.627]  We can pull it up.
[02:12:04.627 --> 02:12:11.549]  But he basically said, I believe in humans involved, not some Einstein program computer that could have a glitch.
[02:12:11.549 --> 02:12:15.730]  Because we all know sometimes your car stalls out and you've got
[02:12:17.204 --> 02:12:20.987]  The power steering, and you may be strong, you can't control that car.
[02:12:20.987 --> 02:12:22.088]  That's scary!
[02:12:22.088 --> 02:12:28.293]  I like the old-fashioned cars, where if you ran out of gas or things stalled, you were controlling the wheel.
[02:12:28.293 --> 02:12:29.213]  And it's the same thing.
[02:12:29.213 --> 02:12:32.176]  Humans are being removed from the equation.
[02:12:32.176 --> 02:12:41.103]  Self-driving cars, self-flying airplanes, algorithms, all the dinners that, you know, cook themselves, and so nobody knows how to cook a meal.
[02:12:41.730 --> 02:12:44.915]  We're losing our humanity and it's fulfilling to garden.
[02:12:44.915 --> 02:12:48.139]  It's fulfilling to cook pasta or cook chicken or steaks.
[02:12:48.139 --> 02:12:51.004]  It's fulfilling to do carpentry.
[02:12:51.004 --> 02:12:52.546]  We're meant to build things.
[02:12:52.546 --> 02:12:54.629]  We built the machines.
[02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:56.512]  Let's not let the machines take over our lives.
[02:12:57.904 --> 02:12:59.865]  But the big takeaway is there's a debate.
[02:12:59.865 --> 02:13:02.187]  Five, six, how many days is it into this now?
[02:13:02.187 --> 02:13:02.967]  What caused it?
[02:13:02.967 --> 02:13:03.587]  Who knows?
[02:13:03.587 --> 02:13:04.768]  Ground all the planes.
[02:13:04.768 --> 02:13:07.870]  It's the same old 737 badass airframe.
[02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:09.030]  Big, juicy engines.
[02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:10.251]  Great avionics.
[02:13:10.251 --> 02:13:11.592]  The best equipment ever.
[02:13:11.592 --> 02:13:13.873]  But there's a glitch in the sensor.
[02:13:13.873 --> 02:13:17.475]  And the pilots are in the Federal Register for a year all over the U.S.
[02:13:17.475 --> 02:13:21.017]  and the world saying the autopilot's got a glitch.
[02:13:21.017 --> 02:13:25.460]  We have to play dumb, kill Boeing stock by 30% instead of fixing the bug.
[02:13:26.258 --> 02:13:27.019]  Insanity.
[02:13:27.019 --> 02:13:31.002]  Let's go to the President laying the grounding out from yesterday.
[02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:31.303]  Here it is.
[02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:46.877]  We're here to make an announcement very shortly regarding the new information and physical evidence that we've received from the site and from other locations and through a couple of other complaints.
[02:13:46.877 --> 02:13:50.881]  We've had a very, very detailed
[02:13:52.281 --> 02:13:59.506]  A group of people working on the 737-8 and the 737-9 new airplanes.
[02:13:59.506 --> 02:14:11.574]  We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 MAX 8 and the 737 MAX 9 and planes associated with that line.
[02:14:18.934 --> 02:14:35.138]  I've spoken to Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation, Dan Elwell, Acting Administrator of the FAA, and to Dennis Muilenburg, CEO of Boeing, and they'll be available shortly after our conference today.
[02:14:35.138 --> 02:14:39.780]  They are all in agreement with the action.
[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:45.741]  Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice.
[02:14:45.741 --> 02:14:48.002]  So planes that are in the air will be grounded
[02:14:49.885 --> 02:14:56.608]  Let's stop right there.
[02:14:56.608 --> 02:15:02.990]  The craziness is, again yesterday, I, and I've got video, we just B-rolled it for TV viewers, I'm literally on the tarmac.
[02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:07.852]  They close the door, they have this big discussion, we stand on the tarmac 30 minutes longer than we're supposed to.
[02:15:09.216 --> 02:15:17.463]  And then I start talking as I'm in the front row to the flight attendants and they go, well, Trump just just announced minutes ago until we're deciding if we're going to take off.
[02:15:17.463 --> 02:15:18.444]  They were all flustered.
[02:15:18.444 --> 02:15:21.947]  And the guy's like, God, I wonder if I'm going to get to go to that party tonight in Austin.
[02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:27.271]  So that's that's how I was getting all this inside baseball and then talk to the pilot, because there was like 20, 30 minutes of not sure.
[02:15:27.271 --> 02:15:29.573]  And it was like, no, no, go to your destination.
[02:15:29.573 --> 02:15:32.795]  So they kind of took off to Austin.
[02:15:32.795 --> 02:15:35.738]  But that's how crazy this has gotten when
[02:15:36.559 --> 02:15:38.020]  The pilots fly the planes.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.523]  Trust them and the engineers.
[02:15:40.523 --> 02:15:44.546]  It's a sensor problem with the autopilot.
[02:15:44.546 --> 02:15:45.848]  And that's all that's happening.
[02:15:45.848 --> 02:15:52.994]  And all you've got to do is tell the pilots, especially in third world countries that don't do their research, I guess, read the damn manual.
[02:15:52.994 --> 02:15:55.416]  Turn off the frickin autopilot.
[02:15:55.416 --> 02:15:56.477]  Fly the plane.
[02:15:56.477 --> 02:15:57.899]  Humans, remember those people?
[02:15:59.901 --> 02:16:03.766]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[02:16:03.766 --> 02:16:08.752]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[02:16:08.752 --> 02:16:13.577]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[02:16:13.577 --> 02:16:14.939]  Don't just take my word for it.

[02:17:29.187 --> 02:17:35.549]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:38.589]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:44.511]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:44.511 --> 02:17:48.292]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:48.292 --> 02:17:49.552]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:49.552 --> 02:17:50.572]  Who do we fight for?

[02:19:07.591 --> 02:19:10.813]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:19:10.813 --> 02:19:14.175]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:19:14.175 --> 02:19:15.395]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:19:15.395 --> 02:19:16.196]  We'll be here forever.
[02:19:16.196 --> 02:19:17.456]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:19:17.456 --> 02:19:24.340]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:24.901]  We made it.
[02:19:24.901 --> 02:19:26.742]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:19:26.742 --> 02:19:28.743]  But hey, God's got a big war for you, rather.
[02:19:29.463 --> 02:19:30.083]  I don't know.
[02:19:45.814 --> 02:19:49.738]  I mean, all I know is, I want to go with the master built.
[02:19:49.738 --> 02:19:51.020]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:54.143]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[02:19:54.143 --> 02:19:55.285]  Not these devil worshippers.
[02:19:55.285 --> 02:19:58.188]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:19:58.188 --> 02:19:59.269]  I want life!
[02:19:59.269 --> 02:20:04.475]  I want Jesus!
[02:20:04.475 --> 02:20:07.098]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.511 --> 02:20:18.952]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:18.952 --> 02:20:21.613]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:30.977]  So, I want to get into AOC and some of her crazy behavior that takes the cake so far.
[02:20:30.977 --> 02:20:37.540]  We can't snicker too much because there's a very, very dark, stinking, rotting underbelly to this.
[02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:40.862]  For those of us that are informed and involved, see what a joke she is.
[02:20:40.862 --> 02:20:43.403]  But for those that aren't, they're buying the
[02:20:44.511 --> 02:20:45.191]  The BS.
[02:20:45.191 --> 02:20:47.113]  They are buying the baloney big time.
[02:20:47.113 --> 02:21:05.884]  First off, you know, I was reading some of the comments on Infowars.com yesterday and today on a video report I did for Infowars.com dealing with the fact that President Trump, who only pulled the exact headline, Alex Jones, Trump's portrayal of American rights, heartbreaking!
[02:21:05.884 --> 02:21:11.367]  And then I read the massive amount of comments and about half of them were saying, oh,
[02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:18.391]  You think you're gonna get arrested like Roger Stone, so now you're throwing Trump under the bus.
[02:21:18.391 --> 02:21:24.692]  And the other half are like, no, Trump's a total traitorous snake, and Jones is right to go after him.
[02:21:24.692 --> 02:21:27.113]  Thank God Jones is finally doing it.
[02:21:27.113 --> 02:21:29.213]  Well, you're both wrong.
[02:21:29.213 --> 02:21:33.874]  Trump's pragmatic, Trump's pro-America, Trump's doing a lot of great things.
[02:21:33.874 --> 02:21:40.135]  But his belief that he can't go after the racketeering combines, the big tech, who've been caught red-handed censoring us,
[02:21:41.306 --> 02:21:53.193]  And the fact that he's saying he's probably not going to do anything and we all just better behave ourselves and maybe we'll still be left on the internet, that makes me see red.
[02:21:53.193 --> 02:21:58.397]  And so talking to people that are close to the President, they say, listen, he's surrounded by neocons, BSing him.
[02:21:58.397 --> 02:22:04.440]  The only way you get his attention is getting very upset and very angry at him, like Tucker Carlson and others have done.
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:05.981]  And so that's what I'm doing.
[02:22:05.981 --> 02:22:08.683]  I thank God every day he's the President versus Hillary Clinton.
[02:22:10.171 --> 02:22:24.276]  But when I watch all the proof of them, big tech lying to Congress, and I watch all the proof of the censorship, and I experience it, and I see it expanding against everybody, it makes me get really, really, really, really upset.
[02:22:24.276 --> 02:22:29.218]  So, no, it's not that Trump's a snake in the grass and he's this evil operative out to get us.
[02:22:29.218 --> 02:22:32.760]  No, the globalists legitimately want him out.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:36.341]  And it's not that I'm a bad guy now who wants to be left alone by Hillary.
[02:22:37.708 --> 02:22:38.348]  In the deep state.
[02:22:38.348 --> 02:22:39.648]  So I'm turning against Trump.
[02:22:39.648 --> 02:22:42.429]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:42.429 --> 02:22:46.490]  This audience, myself, all of you got Trump elected.
[02:22:46.490 --> 02:22:48.310]  We're the Americana movement.
[02:22:48.310 --> 02:22:50.071]  Nationalism is exploding worldwide.
[02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:54.132]  We're the wave that Trump rode in on.
[02:22:54.132 --> 02:22:57.652]  And I want Trump with his executive power and the president to take action!
[02:22:57.652 --> 02:23:00.153]  I love Trump!
[02:23:00.153 --> 02:23:02.613]  But then I really hate some of his actions.
[02:23:02.613 --> 02:23:04.294]  It's a love-hate relationship.
[02:23:04.294 --> 02:23:05.434]  So, Trump's good.
[02:23:06.354 --> 02:23:08.895]  But if you go read the Breitbart interview.
[02:23:08.895 --> 02:23:10.536]  It's up on Infowars.com yesterday.
[02:23:10.536 --> 02:23:12.357]  Maybe I can pull it up today.
[02:23:12.357 --> 02:23:16.580]  It's already scrolled off, but it was something like a headline.
[02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:17.680]  We'll try to pull it up.
[02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:22.263]  Trump says be well behaved, be really good.
[02:23:22.263 --> 02:23:26.045]  Oh, like Franklin Graham getting taken off Facebook or all the rest of it.
[02:23:26.045 --> 02:23:27.365]  You know what gets taken off?
[02:23:27.365 --> 02:23:29.526]  Effective, truthful, well done stuff.
[02:23:29.526 --> 02:23:30.987]  Like Prager University.
[02:23:30.987 --> 02:23:33.949]  Oh, can Prager, who comes off like a
[02:23:36.008 --> 02:23:38.749]  School counselor?
[02:23:38.749 --> 02:23:40.629]  Very well-spoken, very genteel.
[02:23:40.629 --> 02:23:45.411]  You can't get more G-rated, more friendly, more nice, more gregarious.
[02:23:45.411 --> 02:23:50.012]  Could he be better behaved, El Presidente?
[02:23:50.012 --> 02:23:52.213]  So, that's all I'm saying.
[02:23:52.213 --> 02:23:55.554]  Is that it's really starting to get to me.
[02:23:55.554 --> 02:24:01.936]  And first we heard about executive orders a year ago, and all these actions, and then none of those happened.
[02:24:01.936 --> 02:24:04.357]  And then we heard, well it'll be on the platform for 2020.
[02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:08.251]  And now it's not.
[02:24:08.251 --> 02:24:09.752]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:24:09.752 --> 02:24:11.092]  Not that Trump's taking lobbyist money.
[02:24:11.092 --> 02:24:13.093]  He's fired almost all the lobbyists.
[02:24:13.093 --> 02:24:23.775]  But still, Fox News, the establishment, they see big powerful websites like InfoWars.com or DrugReport.com or DailyCaller.com, Breitbart.com.
[02:24:23.775 --> 02:24:27.796]  They see those as competition to campaign dollars.
[02:24:27.796 --> 02:24:29.417]  Well, I don't take advertising.
[02:24:29.417 --> 02:24:34.158]  Some of the radio stations I'm on, the radio network I'm on do, but I don't take money from political advertising.
[02:24:35.373 --> 02:24:43.057]  In my whole history, I think a few times back when we took advertising, a few local candidates were like state reps slip through like Oklahoma or something.
[02:24:43.057 --> 02:24:46.338]  Less than 1% of our money has been political money is my point.
[02:24:46.338 --> 02:24:53.242]  For average talk radio, upwards of half their money in election years, political money.
[02:24:53.242 --> 02:24:54.462]  So we don't do that.
[02:24:54.462 --> 02:24:57.464]  We don't take political money.
[02:24:57.464 --> 02:24:57.784]  We don't
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:24:59.360]  Take any of it.
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:06.762]  I mean, if our work was a white tablecloth, you might find one little tiny brown spot the size of a freckle where we took political money.
[02:25:06.762 --> 02:25:10.363]  And I'm not saying it's bad to take money to run political ads.
[02:25:10.363 --> 02:25:12.064]  I'm not judging stations that do that.
[02:25:12.064 --> 02:25:14.084]  I'm saying that's not who we are.
[02:25:14.084 --> 02:25:15.805]  But that's the big secret.
[02:25:15.805 --> 02:25:20.246]  The rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say, good day, is that
[02:25:21.155 --> 02:25:41.900]  The Karl Roves of the world that bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in off-year elections, and even more during general elections, they want it all to Sinclair, and all to Fox News, and all to that... We're not even trying to get that money!
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:50.642]  But there are thousands of PACs that are very effective, that are raising millions of dollars, and that are running ads, and that are effective, and that scares
[02:25:51.491 --> 02:25:57.273]  The old, not that old people are bad, but in this case they're old thinking, old political establishment.
[02:25:57.273 --> 02:26:16.099]  So there's a perfect storm of dying corporate media, dying leftist media, authoritarian colleges that are so corrupt with worthless degrees collapsing, governments that are corrupt and collapsing, not just here but all over the world, China financing anti-free speech movements, and they don't know what to do.
[02:26:16.099 --> 02:26:17.799]  They don't know how to respond.
[02:26:17.799 --> 02:26:20.420]  And so they just say, shut it all down.
[02:26:21.115 --> 02:26:30.118]  And the final little ingredient is the PR firms, the lobbyists, the ad agencies that make b-b-b-b-b-billions.
[02:26:30.118 --> 02:26:34.860]  About $4 billion on a general election, about $2 billion on an off-year election.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:36.220]  And they're making all that money.
[02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:46.404]  And the mere fact that it embarrasses them that grassroots websites and grassroots talk shows will have viral videos, not that we even put out, everybody puts them out.
[02:26:47.478 --> 02:26:55.720]  You'll go look at the top ten viral videos during an election, and nine of them are mom-and-pop PACs, or groups that aren't even PACs.
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:15.366]  And that's why, that's why they want everybody shut down, and that's why they say Drugs Report and Infowars are political, and the Federal Elections Commission, because when we say we're pro-gun, or we're pro-life, or we support President Trump, or we support this congressman, or this congresswoman, they know that's politically getting them elected.
[02:27:16.101 --> 02:27:17.442]  It's not political money.
[02:27:17.442 --> 02:27:18.562]  It's not even political speech.
[02:27:18.562 --> 02:27:20.003]  It's our free speech.
[02:27:20.003 --> 02:27:26.045]  But they're trying to convolute all of that together to then shut us down.
[02:27:26.045 --> 02:27:31.467]  So the final equation is Fox News and all these people, they don't want political competition.
[02:27:31.467 --> 02:27:33.328]  They want to be the only game in town.
[02:27:33.328 --> 02:27:39.450]  And they'd rather Trump lose the election or America go down the tubes if they can ride us going down for another decade.
[02:27:39.450 --> 02:27:42.391]  And it really is treason.
[02:27:42.391 --> 02:27:43.532]  It really is disgusting.
[02:27:43.532 --> 02:27:43.672]  And so
[02:27:45.123 --> 02:28:06.538]  Whether Trump's getting bad advice or whether he's been compromised, whatever the case is, the biggest sterling issue, even bigger than the border, is free speech in this country and the fact that President Trump is dead in the water, letting a twist of the wind, and basically said, I'm not coming to your aid, get used to it.
[02:28:07.632 --> 02:28:09.093]  Greenlight Facebook.
[02:28:09.093 --> 02:28:10.113]  Greenlight Google.
[02:28:10.113 --> 02:28:11.413]  Greenlight Twitter.
[02:28:11.413 --> 02:28:12.494]  Greenlight YouTube.
[02:28:12.494 --> 02:28:14.054]  Greenlight everybody.
[02:28:14.054 --> 02:28:22.478]  You shut down whoever you want, and you do it, you organize yourselves, and you lie to Congress, and I'm not gonna do a damn thing.
[02:28:22.478 --> 02:28:25.379]  Sure, he says in the interview, they're doing it, they lied.
[02:28:25.379 --> 02:28:28.520]  But you know what?
[02:28:28.520 --> 02:28:33.242]  Bend over and enjoy it, and behave yourself with Stockholm Syndrome, and maybe we'll leave you alone.
[02:28:33.242 --> 02:28:34.782]  That really freaks me out.
[02:28:34.782 --> 02:28:36.663]  And so I'm saying, put pressure on Trump,
[02:28:37.333 --> 02:28:48.805]  As citizen activists, as citizen lobbyists, for free speech, to stop it and say, no, you try red flag laws and take our guns without due process, that's a done deal, too.
[02:28:48.805 --> 02:28:55.631]  Trump needs to know, hey, listen here, you're not our pimp, we're not your hoes, we don't just do whatever you want.
[02:28:55.631 --> 02:28:57.073]  You got that, Jack?
[02:28:57.073 --> 02:28:58.054]  Now get ready, Trump.
[02:28:59.867 --> 02:29:04.868]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[02:29:04.868 --> 02:29:13.070]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family after building a seven-figure business from his couch.
[02:29:13.070 --> 02:29:18.992]  God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:29:19.432 --> 02:29:22.055]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[02:29:22.055 --> 02:29:26.881]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.
[02:29:26.881 --> 02:29:29.925]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[02:29:36.613 --> 02:29:36.993]  I think.
[02:30:00.982 --> 02:30:04.244]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[02:30:04.244 --> 02:30:07.246]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.

[02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:15.311]  X2 is back.

[02:30:19.314 --> 02:30:20.094]  It's been bottled.

[02:32:00.385 --> 02:32:05.348]  This bar, at its regular price, is a little over $3.
[02:32:05.348 --> 02:32:10.232]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[02:32:10.232 --> 02:32:14.214]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[02:32:14.214 --> 02:32:15.615]  This is high-end.
[02:32:15.615 --> 02:32:18.557]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.

[02:32:22.121 --> 02:32:23.583]  Launch Discount.
[02:32:23.583 --> 02:32:32.471]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturing developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.

[02:32:58.016 --> 02:32:59.017]  It's that simple.
[02:32:59.017 --> 02:33:03.922]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:33:03.922 --> 02:33:06.605]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.859 --> 02:33:23.722]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:23.722 --> 02:33:29.706]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.706 --> 02:33:47.980]  So, while we laugh at the evil, obviously demonically possessed archives of the, what I believe is methamphetamine addict AOC, while we laugh, remember, our school children in accredited private schools and public schools
[02:33:48.923 --> 02:33:52.425]  And about 78% of schools in the U.S.
[02:33:52.425 --> 02:33:57.127]  are being taught exactly what AOC is spewing.
[02:33:57.127 --> 02:34:09.193]  So we can sit there and laugh at her as an extremist, but the communists, the socialists have killed 200 plus million people the last century, a good 10 million plus people this century, and they mean business.
[02:34:09.193 --> 02:34:16.697]  So when you hear her say capitalism is irredeemable, that's a quote, or America's garbage, we're gonna play this quote,
[02:34:17.751 --> 02:34:20.212]  You're thinking, well, this is insanity.
[02:34:20.212 --> 02:34:26.755]  Well, sure, she's a low IQ, probably 75 IQ, clearly, in my view, drug addict, meth head puppet.
[02:34:26.755 --> 02:34:28.555]  She'll be thrown away later.
[02:34:28.555 --> 02:34:38.840]  But it's her job to introduce all these poisonous carcinogen-laced lies to the public, because you've got all these big polls.
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:46.663]  Another one came out earlier this week, but you've got Gallup polls and others, all saying between 49 and 55 percent, depending on the poll, but roughly half
[02:34:47.370 --> 02:34:52.634]  Of Millennials and Generation Z. So that's people under about 33, 34.
[02:34:52.634 --> 02:34:55.936]  They want communism or socialism.
[02:34:55.936 --> 02:34:58.097]  They believe in a free lunch.
[02:34:58.097 --> 02:35:07.083]  Now, sure, the system we have is crony capitalism and combines and groups rigging things, but they're rigging and siphoning off a big, powerful free market juggernaut.
[02:35:07.083 --> 02:35:13.748]  And they're weakening it, but still it's light years better, obviously, than communism or socialism.
[02:35:15.163 --> 02:35:17.984]  Take our once great medicine in the 1960s.
[02:35:17.984 --> 02:35:19.985]  We had the very best medicine in the world.
[02:35:19.985 --> 02:35:27.227]  Then we made it mandatory, put government spending behind it, ballooned the amount of cost, and now it's falling apart.
[02:35:27.227 --> 02:35:29.288]  It's the same thing with education.
[02:35:29.288 --> 02:35:40.191]  It was some of the best education in the world, but then all of these corporate groups and hospital groups got behind subsidizing health care, they put more money behind it, drug up prices, lowered quality.
[02:35:40.191 --> 02:35:42.852]  So it's the same story over and over again, and sure you've got
[02:35:44.397 --> 02:35:48.961]  The clearly elected president of Venezuela inviting her down.
[02:35:48.961 --> 02:35:51.243]  She said, hell no, I'm not coming down there.
[02:35:51.243 --> 02:35:57.309]  Because while the average Venezuelan fights for their life to eat garbage, it's eat garbage or die.
[02:35:57.309 --> 02:35:59.471]  In socialist countries, you eat garbage or die.
[02:35:59.471 --> 02:36:08.258]  She knows she's part of the ruling elite wearing $3,000, $5,000 outfits, $1,000 shoes, flying around in helicopters and private jets, driving, you know, $100,000 SUVs.
[02:36:11.042 --> 02:36:13.302]  That's for you to not have a car.
[02:36:13.302 --> 02:36:15.103]  That's for you to not have air-conditioning.
[02:36:15.103 --> 02:36:19.484]  Like when Obama went to Africa and said, you can't have cars, you can't have air-conditioning.
[02:36:19.484 --> 02:36:20.864]  That's for you, not for him.
[02:36:20.864 --> 02:36:24.205]  He's part of the ruling class.
[02:36:24.205 --> 02:36:36.547]  So I wanted to play some of these clips and remember, they all dovetail with people like Governor Cuomo in New York saying America was never great and will never be that great.
[02:36:37.774 --> 02:36:39.755]  Because they're conquering America.
[02:36:39.755 --> 02:36:41.595]  They don't want it to succeed.
[02:36:41.595 --> 02:36:44.876]  They want it to fail because they want to loot it.
[02:36:44.876 --> 02:36:46.597]  It's elementary, my dear Watson.
[02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:47.817]  And look, I know you know that.
[02:36:47.817 --> 02:36:49.137]  You're laughing at her.
[02:36:49.137 --> 02:36:50.578]  But don't laugh!
[02:36:50.578 --> 02:36:53.779]  Because she's winning because you're not involved in the schools.
[02:36:53.779 --> 02:36:55.039]  I'm not involved in the schools.
[02:36:55.039 --> 02:36:58.280]  We're not out there up front saying no to these monsters.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.641]  We're letting wild-eyed demons run our lives.
[02:37:00.641 --> 02:37:01.821]  So what does it say about us?
[02:37:01.821 --> 02:37:05.502]  If she's so weak, if she's so laughable, if she's so pathetic, then who are we?
[02:37:07.088 --> 02:37:09.048]  Well, we're the slave of AOC.
[02:37:09.048 --> 02:37:10.889]  We're AOC's bitch.
[02:37:10.889 --> 02:37:12.789]  She's our pimp.
[02:37:12.789 --> 02:37:17.750]  So here's AOC in Austin just a few days ago, calling America garbage.
[02:37:17.750 --> 02:37:20.031]  Well, then get the hell out, sister.
[02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:21.971]  Here it is.
[02:37:21.971 --> 02:37:28.893]  I think all of these things sound radical compared to where we are, but where we are is not a good thing.
[02:37:28.893 --> 02:37:32.674]  And this idea of like 10% better from garbage,
[02:37:34.106 --> 02:37:36.068]  It shouldn't be what we settled for.
[02:37:36.068 --> 02:37:42.632]  It's like this like... It feels like moderate is not a stance.
[02:37:42.632 --> 02:37:49.497]  It's just an attitude toward life of like... Don't hold back.
[02:37:49.497 --> 02:37:51.239]  Tell me how you really feel about incrementalism.
[02:37:51.239 --> 02:37:57.183]  But... Show America's garbage on its trajectory.
[02:37:58.453 --> 02:38:00.814]  And since socialism took over, it's been going down.
[02:38:00.814 --> 02:38:04.115]  But she's claiming everybody wants to get here because we're garbage.
[02:38:04.115 --> 02:38:07.496]  And clearly, she looks like she's on hardcore drugs.
[02:38:07.496 --> 02:38:09.077]  If you're a radio listener, you don't see it.
[02:38:09.077 --> 02:38:11.778]  I mean, she is circling the toilet bowl fast.
[02:38:11.778 --> 02:38:16.920]  You know, she's committed all these Federal Election Commission crimes, stolen millions, cut and dry.
[02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.920]  But hey, don't hold your breath, though.
[02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:21.761]  Remember, Pelosi can engage in crime.
[02:38:21.761 --> 02:38:23.682]  Maxine Waters can engage in crime.
[02:38:23.682 --> 02:38:25.623]  Hillary can have her foundation steal billions.
[02:38:25.623 --> 02:38:26.083]  It's okay.
[02:38:26.627 --> 02:38:29.990]  Because the Justice Department works for them.
[02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:34.414]  Look at all the strop testimony, all the page testimony that's come out, proving everything.
[02:38:34.414 --> 02:38:40.980]  It was all a witch hunt, all political, but it's not getting any coverage, except for Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:43.422]  Which is why they want to shut down, and then the President won't defend us.
[02:38:43.422 --> 02:38:44.743]  He says, hey, be censored!
[02:38:44.743 --> 02:38:47.166]  Learn to bend over and have your rights taken!
[02:38:47.166 --> 02:38:48.707]  I don't want the internet defending me!
[02:38:48.707 --> 02:38:50.048]  Okay, Trump, great, whatever!
[02:38:50.048 --> 02:38:52.430]  God, what a nightmare.
[02:38:52.430 --> 02:38:53.011]  Unbelievable.
[02:38:53.777 --> 02:38:55.098]  So here's another one.
[02:38:55.098 --> 02:38:56.939]  AOC slams capitalism.
[02:38:56.939 --> 02:39:01.001]  Let's listen to this jewel in the really big ones coming up.
[02:39:01.001 --> 02:39:07.845]  The tough part about this, about like, is capitalism redeemable, etc.
[02:39:07.845 --> 02:39:20.432]  is that it's hard to have these conversations, I think, as a society because we all have different ideas of what, just in the public imagination, there are different ideas of what
[02:39:22.279 --> 02:39:25.922]  Does capitalism mean what does socialism mean etc.
[02:39:25.922 --> 02:39:38.350]  But for me when I think about what those definitions are capitalism isn't to me is it's an ideology of capital.
[02:39:38.350 --> 02:39:43.634]  It puts capital the most important thing is the concentration of capital
[02:39:45.397 --> 02:39:47.398]  No, that's not what, quote, capitalism is.
[02:40:07.549 --> 02:40:15.433]  Meanwhile, you have these crony fascist systems that work with the communists and others that ruin the environment like no other and you'll never hear her criticize China.
[02:40:15.433 --> 02:40:18.834]  You'll never hear her criticize Venezuela.
[02:40:18.834 --> 02:40:20.895]  They are the most exploitive groups in the world.
[02:40:20.895 --> 02:40:22.516]  Now here's an incredible exchange.
[02:40:22.516 --> 02:40:24.617]  She reaches next level dumbness.
[02:40:25.296 --> 02:40:32.179]  When she's talking to the head of Wells Fargo and blaming them for loans they give people.
[02:40:32.179 --> 02:40:35.881]  So if I loan you money for a truck and you run somebody over, it's my fault.
[02:40:35.881 --> 02:40:39.962]  This is just next level how she's extending guilt to everyone but her.
[02:40:39.962 --> 02:40:41.163]  Everyone's guilty but her.
[02:40:41.163 --> 02:40:42.123]  Here it is.
[02:40:42.123 --> 02:40:50.207]  Why was the bank involved in the caging of children and financing the caging of children to begin with?
[02:40:50.207 --> 02:40:52.928]  I don't know how to answer that question because we weren't.
[02:40:54.479 --> 02:41:01.382]  So in finance, you were involved in debt financing of CoreCivic and GeoGroup, correct?
[02:41:01.382 --> 02:41:04.584]  For a period of time, we were involved in financing one of the firms.
[02:41:04.584 --> 02:41:06.405]  We're not anymore in the other.
[02:41:06.405 --> 02:41:12.407]  I'm not familiar with the specific assertion that you're making, but we weren't directly involved in that.
[02:41:12.407 --> 02:41:19.771]  Okay, so these companies run private detention facilities run by ICE, which is involved in caging children.
[02:41:19.771 --> 02:41:20.551]  But I'll move on.
[02:41:21.372 --> 02:41:26.176]  Mr. Sloan, Wells Fargo was also... Hold on, let's stop right there.
[02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:29.058]  Back it up, because we're going to go to the next segment with this.
[02:41:29.058 --> 02:41:29.919]  You just heard her.
[02:41:29.919 --> 02:41:33.382]  Wells Fargo has been involved financing U.S.
[02:41:33.382 --> 02:41:40.889]  government projects where they use private contractors to build emergency centers for the collapsing third world into our country.
[02:41:40.889 --> 02:41:44.132]  I mean, folks, if you stay one day extra in Mexico, they come arrest you at your hotel.
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:55.564]  Oh, but my God, if Mexico's collapsing into us with the rest of Latin America, he's not supposed to be able to then give financing to the construction companies that go get U.S.
[02:41:55.564 --> 02:41:56.225]  government bids.
[02:41:56.225 --> 02:41:57.145]  A company gets a U.S.
[02:41:57.145 --> 02:42:00.166]  government bid, and they get the contract.
[02:42:00.166 --> 02:42:00.887]  They go, we have a U.S.
[02:42:00.887 --> 02:42:01.607]  government contract.
[02:42:01.607 --> 02:42:02.888]  We're a legitimate company.
[02:42:02.888 --> 02:42:04.768]  Been in business for 30, 40 years.
[02:42:04.768 --> 02:42:07.430]  We have A++ rating.
[02:42:07.430 --> 02:42:08.110]  We now need
[02:42:08.797 --> 02:42:18.024]  Whatever the case is, 10 million, 30 million, whatever the project is, from Wells Fargo to build it as the government contract comes in, in the next three phases.
[02:42:18.024 --> 02:42:21.867]  She's now saying, you put kids in cages, and you know where that goes.
[02:42:21.867 --> 02:42:29.813]  It was Obama before they built all the emergency centers, who started the collapse of Latin America to flood us with the UN, who put kids in cages.
[02:42:29.813 --> 02:42:30.713]  It wasn't even Trump.
[02:42:30.713 --> 02:42:36.718]  They've now built nicer facilities, but it's lie on top of lie on top of lie on top of lie
[02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:39.731]  Man, I tell you, these people don't know how business works.
[02:42:39.731 --> 02:42:43.474]  If I got a contract, a government contract, you don't get paid right away.
[02:42:43.474 --> 02:42:46.456]  Then you've got to go borrow the money on the contract.
[02:42:46.456 --> 02:42:48.818]  They're saying that he put kids in cages.
[02:42:48.818 --> 02:42:51.160]  I mean, he's an economic terrorist.
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:53.041]  He's clearly a meth head.
[02:42:53.041 --> 02:42:55.263]  But, he represents the democratic soul.
[02:42:59.835 --> 02:43:05.578]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:43:59.863 --> 02:44:07.707]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video
[02:44:08.374 --> 02:44:13.256]  That is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[02:44:13.256 --> 02:44:25.622]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[02:44:25.622 --> 02:44:27.543]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:44:27.543 --> 02:44:30.204]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:44:31.596 --> 02:44:35.918]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[02:44:35.918 --> 02:44:40.159]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.

[02:47:03.819 --> 02:47:06.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:17.111]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:17.111 --> 02:47:20.112]  You ever notice that Hillary Clinton
[02:47:38.983 --> 02:47:51.065]  Michael Moore, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, all the usual suspects, George Soros, they're never worried about pipelines in China.
[02:47:51.065 --> 02:47:54.046]  They're never worried about pipelines in the Middle East.
[02:47:54.046 --> 02:47:57.487]  They're worried about pipelines in Africa to the CHICOM ships.
[02:47:57.487 --> 02:48:04.188]  They're worried about Mexican pipelines, or Argentinian pipelines, or South African pipelines, or Russian pipelines.
[02:48:05.856 --> 02:48:06.616]  Well, that's not true.
[02:48:06.616 --> 02:48:09.538]  They actually want war with the Russians trying to build pipelines to Europe.
[02:48:09.538 --> 02:48:21.382]  They don't want Canada, with all its oil and all its cash, bringing in that energy instead of it coming out of Saudi Arabia at half the cost to Americans.
[02:48:21.382 --> 02:48:25.864]  The average Canadian oil and gas comes in at around half the price.
[02:48:25.864 --> 02:48:27.985]  And free marketers are like, hey, let's lower our prices.
[02:48:27.985 --> 02:48:29.546]  Let's be energy competitive.
[02:48:29.546 --> 02:48:34.888]  And America's not worried about cheap Canadian oil and gas, but she
[02:48:36.132 --> 02:48:39.175]  Warren Buffett and David Rockefeller before he died.
[02:48:39.175 --> 02:48:47.261]  And if you look it up, people like George Soros, they control the trains that take the oil and gas out of Canada.
[02:48:47.261 --> 02:48:50.404]  And most of it goes to Canada's west coast.
[02:48:50.404 --> 02:48:57.910]  It's loaded on super tankers and taken to China and Japan.
[02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:59.171]  So see, they don't want
[02:49:01.644 --> 02:49:08.327]  Canada to start trans-shipping out of the Gulf of Mexico to all of the world, including Europe.
[02:49:08.327 --> 02:49:15.671]  Because you can go to the Gulf, to the Atlantic, just as quickly to Europe as you can go across to Asia.
[02:49:15.671 --> 02:49:24.896]  And if you go look at the congressional battles, what really goes on, it's all about Canada selling us cheap oil and gas that we add to what we're producing in Texas.
[02:49:25.612 --> 02:49:27.013]  More than Saudi Arabia now, by the way.
[02:49:27.013 --> 02:49:28.755]  The United States produces more than Saudi Arabia.
[02:49:28.755 --> 02:49:29.836]  We're now the energy leader.
[02:49:29.836 --> 02:49:34.960]  It's about teaming up with Canada and dominating the world, selling the cheapest oil and gas.
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:38.743]  Which, by the way, totally screws Russia.
[02:49:38.743 --> 02:49:44.368]  So what Trump's been doing is very pro-America and very aggressive.
[02:49:44.368 --> 02:49:45.869]  Think that makes old Pootie Poot happy?
[02:49:47.771 --> 02:49:49.952]  But the Democrats and others, they've got that deal.
[02:49:49.952 --> 02:49:54.093]  They are trying to stop four different pipelines coming down from Canada to the U.S.
[02:49:54.093 --> 02:49:58.795]  Those pipelines are totally safe compared to anything else out there.
[02:49:58.795 --> 02:50:01.496]  But they don't want the Arctic Refuge that Trump just opened up.
[02:50:01.496 --> 02:50:05.838]  It's got more oil than Saudi Arabia on record.
[02:50:05.838 --> 02:50:09.939]  And it's sweet, crude, super clean burning.
[02:50:09.939 --> 02:50:13.501]  Who do you think does all these anti-oil movies in the U.S.?
[02:50:13.501 --> 02:50:13.941]  The Saudis.
[02:50:15.416 --> 02:50:16.357]  Nothing against the Saudis.
[02:50:16.357 --> 02:50:17.197]  Okay, great.
[02:50:17.197 --> 02:50:18.198]  We're going to produce our own oil.
[02:50:18.198 --> 02:50:19.999]  We're going to work with Canada.
[02:50:19.999 --> 02:50:20.679]  They're trying to block it.
[02:50:20.679 --> 02:50:22.260]  So let me go back to AOC.
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:29.885]  AOC is busy blaming Wells Fargo when private companies get the contracts to build ICE emergency centers.
[02:50:29.885 --> 02:50:31.806]  It's a year, two, three year contract.
[02:50:31.806 --> 02:50:34.027]  The government doesn't just give a contractor all the money.
[02:50:34.027 --> 02:50:35.368]  They'd be idiots if they did.
[02:50:35.368 --> 02:50:37.329]  You'd be an idiot if you did.
[02:50:37.329 --> 02:50:40.111]  You have a contractor 20% up front for the material.
[02:50:40.111 --> 02:50:43.873]  Once they go through projects in your contract, usually in thirds, you pay them off if you're smart.
[02:50:45.473 --> 02:50:50.515]  She's pissed that Wells Fargo gives contractors money who get U.S.
[02:50:50.515 --> 02:50:52.795]  contracts to build their facilities.
[02:50:52.795 --> 02:50:55.936]  Then she segues, only like A.O.
[02:50:55.936 --> 02:51:04.439]  she can do, into just how evil it is that they're involved financing gas and oil pipelines in North America.
[02:51:04.439 --> 02:51:05.959]  Imagine the evil.
[02:51:05.959 --> 02:51:07.780]  This woman's house is heated with it.
[02:51:07.780 --> 02:51:09.980]  She drives around in SUVs.
[02:51:09.980 --> 02:51:11.801]  She flies around on private jets.
[02:51:11.801 --> 02:51:13.622]  She swindles millions from people.
[02:51:13.622 --> 02:51:15.102]  She lives like a freaking king!
[02:51:16.374 --> 02:51:25.881]  And she's going to tell you how bad America is having infrastructure because globalism is about de-industrializing North America.
[02:51:25.881 --> 02:51:34.466]  And for all Trump's crimes, and tying his hands behind his back and ours with allowing the censorship, he's light years better than Hillary.
[02:51:34.466 --> 02:51:37.168]  But that doesn't mean I'm not going to come after him.
[02:51:37.168 --> 02:51:38.789]  No, no.
[02:51:38.789 --> 02:51:39.710]  It's kind of like your wife.
[02:51:39.710 --> 02:51:43.352]  You love him to death, but if you catch him cheating on you, you're going to get really upset, right?
[02:51:43.352 --> 02:51:45.174]  I mean, I don't know what the hell Trump's doing.
[02:51:46.789 --> 02:51:48.930]  He's doing a whole show just asking, what do you think he's doing?
[02:51:48.930 --> 02:51:51.011]  What do we do?
[02:51:51.011 --> 02:51:54.032]  Sorry, sorry.
[02:51:54.032 --> 02:51:59.054]  They're now making rumblings about red flag laws where there's no law, they can just take your guns with no law.
[02:51:59.054 --> 02:52:02.335]  I mean, I'm going to divorce Trump at that point, aren't you?
[02:52:02.335 --> 02:52:03.336]  I don't want it to happen.
[02:52:03.336 --> 02:52:07.237]  I'm like, hey, gee, don't punch me in the nose or I'm going to punch you back.
[02:52:07.237 --> 02:52:09.518]  It's not like I'm looking for trouble here.
[02:52:09.518 --> 02:52:10.399]  I'm digressing.
[02:52:10.399 --> 02:52:13.040]  Can we go to the real problem, AOC?
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:13.380]  Here it is.
[02:52:15.537 --> 02:52:22.441]  So you were involved in debt financing of CoreCivic and GeoGroup, correct?
[02:52:22.441 --> 02:52:25.663]  For a period of time, we were involved in financing one of the firms.
[02:52:25.663 --> 02:52:27.444]  We're not anymore in the other.
[02:52:27.444 --> 02:52:33.467]  I'm not familiar with the specific assertion that you're making, but we weren't directly involved in that.
[02:52:33.467 --> 02:52:40.811]  Okay, so these companies run private detention facilities run by ICE, which is involved in caging children.
[02:52:40.811 --> 02:52:41.612]  But I'll move on.
[02:52:42.413 --> 02:52:51.110]  Mr. Sloan, Wells Fargo... Yeah, they finance them and their private facilities is cheaper, but their staff with federal agents.
[02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:52.352]  Again, let's continue.
[02:52:53.001 --> 02:53:01.608]  Mr. Sloan, Wells Fargo was also an investor, a major investor in the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Keystone XL Pipelines.
[02:53:01.608 --> 02:53:10.996]  They were prime investors and lenders to companies building these pipelines in defiance of Standing Rock Sioux's treaty rights to protect its water and sacred lands.
[02:53:10.996 --> 02:53:15.880]  They warned early on, the Lakota Sioux warned early on that the pipeline was unstable and bound to leak.
[02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:22.205]  Despite that, it was built anyway, and it has leaked at least five times.
[02:53:22.205 --> 02:53:24.988]  And the Keystone XL, in particular, had one leak.
[02:53:24.988 --> 02:53:32.314]  If they're doing a repair job on a piece of pipe and two drops hit the ground, they gotta fill a report out that two drops of oil hit the ground.
[02:53:32.314 --> 02:53:34.175]  I mean, this is a literal joke.
[02:53:34.175 --> 02:53:35.977]  Continue.
[02:53:35.977 --> 02:53:40.261]  The Keystone XL, in particular, had one leak that leaked 210,000 gallons across South Dakota.
[02:53:45.051 --> 02:54:01.045]  Since Wells Fargo financed the building of this pipeline in an environmentally unstable way, why shouldn't the bank be held responsible for financing the cleanup of the disasters from these projects?
[02:54:01.045 --> 02:54:03.427]  Which pipeline are you referring to?
[02:54:03.427 --> 02:54:03.707]  Either.
[02:54:03.707 --> 02:54:09.331]  So we were not involved in the financing of the XL Pipeline.
[02:54:09.331 --> 02:54:09.792]  Back it up.
[02:54:09.792 --> 02:54:11.433]  Here's the thing.
[02:54:11.433 --> 02:54:13.515]  She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
[02:54:16.277 --> 02:54:21.899]  I remember when that came out, there was the potential that that much was being sent to the line when it happened.
[02:54:21.899 --> 02:54:23.639]  It turned out it was a media hoax.
[02:54:23.639 --> 02:54:25.159]  Thousands of gallons were not released.
[02:54:25.159 --> 02:54:26.240]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:29.721]  It's just... Plus, none of this is perfect.
[02:54:29.721 --> 02:54:31.481]  This is an industrial world, lady.
[02:54:31.481 --> 02:54:34.262]  Say something about China, you meth witch!
[02:54:34.935 --> 02:54:42.280]  It's just where the rivers light on fire, and they have human-animal clones, and they have to wear masks, and they have no environmental standards.
[02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:51.767]  But no, you just keep bitching and bitching because it's your job to stop this country, because you're an anti-American person that said our country is garbage!
[02:54:51.767 --> 02:54:55.349]  No, you are a bug-eyed demon witch!
[02:54:55.349 --> 02:54:57.831]  You look like a meth head!
[02:54:57.831 --> 02:54:58.972]  You look like a crack whore!
[02:55:00.071 --> 02:55:02.434]  But you're the new Congresswoman!
[02:55:02.434 --> 02:55:04.336]  Somalis that hate Americans!
[02:55:04.336 --> 02:55:05.737]  And you!
[02:55:05.737 --> 02:55:07.720]  And we're supposed to bend over and bow!
[02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:12.365]  I'm not bowing you, you meth-snorting monster!
[02:55:12.365 --> 02:55:14.547]  Sorry, let's go back to her.
[02:55:14.547 --> 02:55:15.909]  Which pipeline are you referring to?
[02:55:16.568 --> 02:55:17.168]  Um, either.
[02:55:17.168 --> 02:55:22.891]  So we were not involved in the financing of the XL Pipeline.
[02:55:22.891 --> 02:55:28.973]  We were one of the 17 or 19 banks that was involved in the financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline.
[02:55:28.973 --> 02:55:35.036]  Okay, so Wells Fargo hasn't financed any company associated with the Keystone XL Pipeline?
[02:55:35.036 --> 02:55:36.376]  No, I didn't say that.
[02:55:36.376 --> 02:55:40.578]  I said we're not involved in financing that pipeline specifically.
[02:55:41.258 --> 02:55:44.000]  So let's focus on the Dakota Access Pipeline.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:52.244]  Should Wells Fargo be held responsible for the damages incurred by climate change due to the financing of fossil fuels and these projects?
[02:55:52.244 --> 02:55:54.745]  I don't know how you'd calculate that, Congresswoman.
[02:55:54.745 --> 02:56:06.152]  Say from spills or when we have to reinvest in infrastructure, building seawalls from the erosion of infrastructure or cleanups, wildfires, etc.? ?
[02:56:08.012 --> 02:56:09.292]  Related to that pipeline?
[02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:15.114]  I'm not aware that there's been any of what you described that's occurred related to that.
[02:56:15.114 --> 02:56:18.375]  There's no coastline in the Dakotas?
[02:56:18.375 --> 02:56:19.596]  I'm telling you, let's just continue.
[02:56:19.596 --> 02:56:21.916]  Dakota Access Pipeline.
[02:56:21.916 --> 02:56:27.758]  I'm not aware of the leaks associated with the Dakota Access Pipeline that you're describing.
[02:56:27.758 --> 02:56:37.761]  So, hypothetically, if there was a leak from the Dakota Access Pipeline, why shouldn't Wells Fargo pay for the cleanup of it, since it paid for the construction of the pipeline itself?
[02:56:37.981 --> 02:56:39.662]  Because we don't operate the pipeline.
[02:56:39.662 --> 02:56:43.706]  We provide financing to the company that's operating the pipeline.
[02:56:43.706 --> 02:57:02.080]  Our responsibility is to ensure that at the time that we make that loan, that that customer, and we have a group of people in Wells Fargo, including an environmental oversight group, headed by one of my colleagues who used to... I forgot to point out, the particular one we're talking about hasn't been built yet.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:02.901]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:57:02.901 --> 02:57:07.064]  She's announcing oil pipeline spills that didn't take place.
[02:57:07.064 --> 02:57:07.565]  Let's continue.
[02:57:08.214 --> 02:57:18.140]  So one question, why did Wells Fargo finance this pipeline when it was widely seen to be environmentally unstable?
[02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:30.668]  Again, the reason that we were one of the 17 or 19 banks that financed that is because our team reviewed the environmental impact and we concluded that it was a risk that we were willing to take.
[02:57:30.668 --> 02:57:35.471]  Yeah, because they just say we can't have pipelines but everybody else can.
[02:57:36.906 --> 02:57:39.930]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:57:39.930 --> 02:57:42.072]  We'll be back with a fourth hour on Alex Jones.
[02:57:42.072 --> 02:57:43.674]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:57:43.674 --> 02:57:45.176]  Infowars.com.
[02:57:45.176 --> 02:57:49.862]  The dreaded beacon of truth.
[02:57:49.862 --> 02:57:52.365]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:57:52.365 --> 02:57:52.986]  X2's back.
[02:57:53.738 --> 02:57:58.402]  The original X2, deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.

[02:58:00.604 --> 02:58:02.045]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:58:02.045 --> 02:58:03.586]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:58:03.586 --> 02:58:04.707]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:06.369]  The best iodine in the world.
[02:58:06.369 --> 02:58:07.510]  X2, it's available.
[02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:08.511]  I thought X3 is great.
[02:58:08.511 --> 02:58:12.514]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source, but I thought add the other two types of iodine.
[02:58:12.514 --> 02:58:13.435]  The scientists that do that.
[02:58:13.435 --> 02:58:15.677]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:58:16.497 --> 02:58:20.879]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:58:20.879 --> 02:58:24.981]  We now have X2 again at InfoWarsTore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:58:24.981 --> 02:58:36.665]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:58:36.665 --> 02:58:45.269]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[02:59:05.851 --> 02:59:14.978]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:14.978 --> 02:59:20.322]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[02:59:30.269 --> 02:59:31.569]  Weak emergency supplies.
[02:59:31.569 --> 02:59:33.790]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:59:33.790 --> 02:59:35.350]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.

[02:59:37.330 --> 02:59:39.871]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[02:59:53.813 --> 02:59:56.494]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.622 --> 03:00:10.749]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.749 --> 03:00:14.293]  Thanks for joining us on the 14th day of March, 2019.
[03:00:14.293 --> 03:00:19.237]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.237 --> 03:00:22.741]  You know, some people have mistaken this broadcast for a cult.
[03:00:22.741 --> 03:00:23.662]  I'm not a Democrat.
[03:00:23.662 --> 03:00:24.723]  I'm not a Republican hack.
[03:00:26.013 --> 03:00:30.356]  Democrats follow what Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi and people like that say.
[03:00:30.356 --> 03:00:34.960]  Establishment Republicans do what Karl Rove says.
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:45.168]  I back President Trump because he supported the idea of the President being the President and national sovereignty being run out of the country and out of the states.
[03:00:45.168 --> 03:00:45.909]  And he's done that.
[03:00:45.909 --> 03:00:47.610]  He's an American President.
[03:00:47.610 --> 03:00:48.751]  He's actually running stuff.
[03:00:49.569 --> 03:00:51.710]  And it's pissing the establishment off.
[03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:56.633]  Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not angry about some of the things Trump's been doing.
[03:00:56.633 --> 03:00:59.034]  And I'm going to tell you about it, because I'm not the cult.
[03:00:59.034 --> 03:01:01.015]  I'm not the Donald John Trump cult.
[03:01:01.015 --> 03:01:03.556]  I'm not the Hillary Rodham cult.
[03:01:03.556 --> 03:01:05.778]  I'll tell you, people always say, you know, have you sold out?
[03:01:05.778 --> 03:01:08.479]  Yeah, I sold out to Jesus Christ.
[03:01:08.479 --> 03:01:09.059]  I did.
[03:01:09.059 --> 03:01:10.340]  It's true.
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:11.180]  It's already been done.
[03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:13.782]  And I sold out to the truth and justice.
[03:01:13.782 --> 03:01:16.063]  And it feels good to be sold.
[03:01:17.107 --> 03:01:38.196]  I'm signed on, like there's no going down that road, but I continually forget on air, as I bet you complain about funding to run our operations, that when I plug consistently two or three times an hour, we bring in the funds and not just continue against all the attacks, which are sustained and ongoing, but we prevail over them.
[03:01:38.196 --> 03:01:44.759]  So let me just thank the listeners that have gotten great products from the store and supported us and encourage others.
[03:01:44.759 --> 03:01:45.539]  There's a trillion
[03:01:46.241 --> 03:01:57.288]  Voices out there because there's seven and a half billion people and there's millions and millions of talk show hosts and voices online and they make thousands of comments a day and that's billions a day and that's trillions every, you know, month.
[03:01:57.288 --> 03:02:00.070]  There are trillions of things being said.
[03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:07.415]  But what we say particularly, like you got a piece of quartz, doesn't hurt Superman.
[03:02:07.415 --> 03:02:09.897]  Got a piece of lead, doesn't hurt Superman.
[03:02:09.897 --> 03:02:12.399]  Got a piece of crystal, doesn't hurt Superman.
[03:02:12.399 --> 03:02:14.340]  Got a paper cup, doesn't hurt Superman.
[03:02:16.738 --> 03:02:19.639]  Info War, Superman starts shriveling up and dying.
[03:02:19.639 --> 03:02:23.260]  And we're not fighting a good man of steel, we're fighting the Diablo.
[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:35.583]  And let me tell you, just like garlic, metaphysically, metaphorically, historically, archetypally, vampires don't like high noon, they don't like silver bullets, they don't like holy water, they don't like garlic.
[03:02:35.583 --> 03:02:36.243]  What does garlic do?
[03:02:36.243 --> 03:02:37.284]  It wards off disease.
[03:02:37.284 --> 03:02:40.044]  It cleanses the blood of evil.
[03:02:40.044 --> 03:02:42.525]  Holy water, metaphysically, water blessed by God.
[03:02:43.717 --> 03:02:48.619]  The sun, you know, giving life to the earth and clarity and vision.
[03:02:48.619 --> 03:02:53.640]  Silver, anti-poison as well to the vampire and the werewolf.
[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:55.701]  These are archetypes.
[03:02:55.701 --> 03:02:57.881]  But InfoWars is beyond an archetype.
[03:02:57.881 --> 03:03:12.966]  It's a real system in the 21st century that is proven and that has gone through the wars and that has paid the price and that has been persecuted and that has been proven to be dedicated to war against the devil.
[03:03:14.835 --> 03:03:20.978]  And that doesn't mean I'm some sanctimonious fake priest going, I'm so good, that I'm diddling some kid in the back.
[03:03:20.978 --> 03:03:25.901]  I'm a sinner, and I'm full of life, and I've tasted a lot of things.
[03:03:25.901 --> 03:03:30.283]  Let me tell you something, I've tasted God, and that's where I want to go.
[03:03:30.283 --> 03:03:36.187]  But to get there, we need a group of people of every race, color, and creed.
[03:03:36.187 --> 03:03:41.850]  I call myself white, but, you know, I'm really a nice brown, if you're watching on television.
[03:03:41.850 --> 03:03:44.171]  But whether you're white or black or old or young,
[03:03:45.049 --> 03:03:48.652]  If you love God and you love liberty, we're brothers and sisters together.
[03:03:48.652 --> 03:03:54.095]  And everything I do is about a win-win, a 360 synergy, a 360 win.
[03:03:54.095 --> 03:03:55.777]  You need the supplements.
[03:03:55.777 --> 03:04:00.100]  You need the DNA Force, 33% off, been sold out for six months.
[03:04:00.100 --> 03:04:03.362]  You need the best fish rolls for adults and children we have.
[03:04:03.362 --> 03:04:04.343]  You need the bodies.
[03:04:04.343 --> 03:04:07.805]  You need the Turbo Force, total energy.
[03:04:07.805 --> 03:04:10.027]  You need the Brain Force, total brain.
[03:04:10.027 --> 03:04:11.788]  You need it all at www.InfoWarStore.com.
[03:04:13.012 --> 03:04:15.073]  And that's how we finance this.
[03:04:15.073 --> 03:04:23.936]  When you sign up for the coffee, or you sign up for the toothpaste, or you sign up for the protein bars, things you're going to want every 15 days, every month, every two months.
[03:04:23.936 --> 03:04:26.196]  You can do 15 days, a month, two months, three months.
[03:04:26.196 --> 03:04:29.298]  After six months, get 10% off for signing up for auto-ship.
[03:04:29.298 --> 03:04:30.698]  Then you don't forget about it.
[03:04:30.698 --> 03:04:32.959]  It just comes like a tide of the truth.
[03:04:32.959 --> 03:04:36.360]  You fund this operation and then you get my commitment.
[03:04:36.360 --> 03:04:41.862]  As I've shown you, if we carry anything in the dark of the night, like a fiery torch, it's liberty.
[03:04:42.682 --> 03:04:54.554]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula, or just want an alternative, InfoWars Lite has the formula for you.
[03:05:06.423 --> 03:05:15.670]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure Krill Oil concentrate.
[03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:24.737]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:36.473]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[03:05:37.131 --> 03:05:49.416]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate, paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil, or used separately.
[03:05:49.416 --> 03:05:55.579]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:12.403 --> 03:06:13.764]  1984 is 1776.
[03:06:13.764 --> 03:06:18.948]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:06:18.948 --> 03:06:24.712]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:24.712 --> 03:06:26.053]  Okay.
[03:06:26.053 --> 03:06:31.897]  Don't know where to begin, but Alex always leaves me with some red meat on the table.
[03:06:31.897 --> 03:06:38.162]  And while I'm making my notes, I usually go back to shake that meat a little bit more and put my put my own teeth into it.
[03:06:39.062 --> 03:06:47.808]  You know, I'm thinking about the AOC, or as Mark Levin calls her, AOC, because it sounds so creepy, AOC.
[03:06:47.808 --> 03:06:50.050]  Or just call her Cortez.
[03:06:50.050 --> 03:06:55.554]  Giving somebody a hyphenated name, that's just, you know, playing their naming.
[03:06:55.554 --> 03:06:59.137]  I call her Cortez or AOC, but I like AOC.
[03:06:59.137 --> 03:07:02.339]  Sounds like a space alien, a lizard.
[03:07:02.339 --> 03:07:06.242]  You know, it's important to recognize that she didn't come from nowhere.
[03:07:07.700 --> 03:07:12.284]  AOC literally won a commie casting call.
[03:07:12.284 --> 03:07:22.993]  There are Democrat Rasputins or, you know, Socialists actually, Democrat Socialist Rasputins behind her, who are old and ugly and white, okay, basically.
[03:07:22.993 --> 03:07:31.620]  And they realized they can't find an easy seat with a vulnerable, you know, a vulnerable Democrat representative.
[03:07:32.449 --> 03:07:35.292]  So they literally held a commie casting call.
[03:07:35.292 --> 03:07:38.654]  Wouldn't you love to see the other the other submissions?
[03:07:38.654 --> 03:07:44.860]  You know, like sending in your audition video to Survivor or some, you know, reality TV show.
[03:07:44.860 --> 03:07:56.330]  So AOC had the bubbly, you know, the bubbly voice and big eyes and and basically she's she's basically just a mannequin for the, you know, for the Rasputins behind her.
[03:07:57.260 --> 03:08:03.062]  You could tell it when she was interviewing the Wells Fargo executive yesterday.
[03:08:03.062 --> 03:08:04.643]  She had no follow-ups.
[03:08:04.643 --> 03:08:12.605]  She was reading notes that one of her Rasputins wrote for her, but when he said, nope, we didn't do that, she was absolutely just stymied.
[03:08:12.605 --> 03:08:19.448]  Okay, well then let's move on to another area where I've been handed a note by my handlers.
[03:08:19.448 --> 03:08:20.528]  So this is where we are.
[03:08:22.252 --> 03:08:39.746]  Probably the most recognizable, leading, energetic, young congressperson won a commie casting call, which is like looking, you know, music producers looking for the right face to become the next pop star.
[03:08:39.746 --> 03:08:50.875]  And it doesn't matter if they can sing or not, because with today's audio and computer magic, they can digitally harmonize anybody to sounding all right.
[03:08:51.548 --> 03:08:54.150]  So she's literally just a face.
[03:08:54.150 --> 03:09:00.894]  But what this tells us is that our country's in deep, deep trouble because it's working.
[03:09:00.894 --> 03:09:05.978]  To the morons that support her, she is literally the second coming.
[03:09:06.539 --> 03:09:09.242]  Green New Deal, $30 trillion, who cares?
[03:09:09.242 --> 03:09:10.803]  That's just numbers.
[03:09:10.803 --> 03:09:17.489]  So we've gone beyond the enlightenment and rational thought into the area of innumeracy.
[03:09:17.489 --> 03:09:19.451]  It's a word like illiteracy.
[03:09:19.451 --> 03:09:25.376]  There are probably half of the country can't understand compound interest, for example.
[03:09:25.376 --> 03:09:31.342]  So if somebody says $3 billion or $30 trillion, literally it means nothing to them any different.
[03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:36.843]  So they have no way of knowing, well, wait a minute, this is impossible, it's going to crash the economy.
[03:09:36.843 --> 03:09:38.744]  Well, that's the plan.
[03:09:38.744 --> 03:09:48.891]  You crash the economy, then you have a ready scapegoat, which will be old white Christian men, primarily, guys like me, that will be blamed.
[03:09:48.891 --> 03:09:54.855]  So this has been seen over and over again, going back to the Jacobins and the French Revolution, the Bolsheviks.
[03:09:54.855 --> 03:09:56.776]  It's a tried and true method.
[03:09:56.776 --> 03:09:59.398]  Wreck the economy, blame your enemies,
[03:10:00.262 --> 03:10:08.171]  Which are the, you know, the religious orders in France during the revolution or the kulak farmers in Russia.
[03:10:08.171 --> 03:10:10.353]  Wipe them out so they can never come back.
[03:10:10.353 --> 03:10:13.076]  You do scorched earth on your enemies.
[03:10:13.076 --> 03:10:20.224]  Of course, what these Bolsheviks are too stupid to realize is that as long as we have the Second Amendment,
[03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:26.006]  The best they can do is trigger a civil war that I think they'll lose big time.
[03:10:26.006 --> 03:10:31.051]  In history, the communists have lost a couple times, and then they get wiped out too.
[03:10:31.051 --> 03:10:37.778]  So if they come for us like wolves on sheep, we'll have no choice but to go sheepdog on them.
[03:10:37.778 --> 03:10:39.359]  And that has happened in history.
[03:10:39.359 --> 03:10:40.921]  The commies do not always win.
[03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:56.856]  You know, when people talk about Switzerland's own version of the Second Amendment with every man doing military service and then taking his modern battle rifle home, they always point out, yeah, you know, Switzerland's never been invaded by a foreign enemy.
[03:10:56.856 --> 03:10:57.476]  True.
[03:10:57.476 --> 03:11:00.958]  They've also never had their own tyrant.
[03:11:00.958 --> 03:11:05.720]  A tyrant would never get to the place where he could confiscate the weapons from the Swiss.
[03:11:05.720 --> 03:11:11.222]  So Switzerland has been a free country because its citizens are armed and would not put up with a tyrant.
[03:11:12.012 --> 03:11:14.533]  No way, no how.
[03:11:14.533 --> 03:11:20.537]  Now, when we've got such a stupid country, really, I call these the Dunning-Kruger Democrats.
[03:11:20.537 --> 03:11:23.798]  People that are, you know, low IQ, they're easily manipulated.
[03:11:23.798 --> 03:11:27.660]  This is why they want more and more flooding in from the third world.
[03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:29.121]  The lower the IQ, the better.
[03:11:29.121 --> 03:11:30.622]  If they can't speak English, that's great.
[03:11:30.622 --> 03:11:33.804]  They'll need Democrat social workers, translators, everything else.
[03:11:35.498 --> 03:11:41.123]  Where you have a chance to make an impact on your family that aren't quite up to speed.
[03:11:41.123 --> 03:11:42.684]  They kind of get that something's wrong.
[03:11:42.684 --> 03:11:47.468]  They don't understand population replacement, what it really means.
[03:11:47.468 --> 03:11:50.931]  But these concepts are really key.
[03:11:50.931 --> 03:11:52.072]  Very key.
[03:11:52.072 --> 03:11:52.892]  Open borders.
[03:11:52.892 --> 03:11:56.215]  Why are the Democrats so adamant about open borders?
[03:11:56.215 --> 03:11:57.676]  Don't let fentanyl flood in.
[03:11:57.676 --> 03:12:02.340]  Don't let murderers come in, be arrested nine times like the last case.
[03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:03.361]  Men murder an American.
[03:12:04.234 --> 03:12:09.995]  The Democrats do not care about the drugs, the human sex slave trafficking.
[03:12:10.888 --> 03:12:14.930]  All they care about is getting future Democrat voters.
[03:12:14.930 --> 03:12:17.611]  This is Cloward-Piven on steroids.
[03:12:17.611 --> 03:12:31.478]  Cloward-Piven, these were two sociologists that came up with the strategy to overwhelm America by flooding it with illegals, wrecking the family, causing more and more people to be government dependent until the system would be overwhelmed.
[03:12:31.478 --> 03:12:34.880]  This is also the point of what they now call single-payer health care.
[03:12:35.640 --> 03:12:38.983]  That the government will be in charge of every aspect of your life.
[03:12:38.983 --> 03:12:42.566]  And to morons, it's very appealing.
[03:12:42.566 --> 03:12:57.360]  So, if you combine open borders and Cloward-Piven, which is a moron population of voters, with, or excuse me, Cloward-Piven is flooding the country, then Dunning-Kruger, the morons, and then you're willing to use Alinsky tactics.
[03:12:57.360 --> 03:13:02.084]  Remember, Saul Alinsky learned his tricks from studying the Chicago mob.
[03:13:02.722 --> 03:13:07.663]  So Alinsky tactics are basically distilled down their mafia tactics.
[03:13:07.663 --> 03:13:10.644]  It means you'll do anything that it takes to win.
[03:13:10.644 --> 03:13:15.465]  You'll lie, cheat, steal, bribe, spread false rumors about people.
[03:13:15.465 --> 03:13:17.485]  That's Alinsky.
[03:13:17.485 --> 03:13:25.807]  So together what these concepts point to, we have a ready example in California and increasingly in many other states.
[03:13:26.474 --> 03:13:34.938]  California went from, you know, from Reagan and Pete Wilson and Prop 187 to becoming a Democrat supermajority.
[03:13:34.938 --> 03:13:41.381]  This means there's no influence that the GOP has because of just extreme radical gerrymandering.
[03:13:41.381 --> 03:13:45.943]  Republicans have no influence in the California legislature or executive.
[03:13:45.943 --> 03:13:46.843]  Zero.
[03:13:46.843 --> 03:13:48.964]  It's being run now like Venezuela.
[03:13:50.774 --> 03:13:53.115]  And it is the plan for all 50 states.
[03:13:53.115 --> 03:13:56.837]  If you look at California and you say, well, it sucks to be them.
[03:13:56.837 --> 03:13:57.918]  I wouldn't want to live there.
[03:13:57.918 --> 03:14:01.320]  Thank God I live in Wyoming or Tennessee.
[03:14:01.320 --> 03:14:08.884]  Well, let me tell you, brother, when Texas and or Florida flip in 2020, that is all she wrote.
[03:14:08.884 --> 03:14:13.227]  The Kalazuela plan is going to be rammed down our throats.
[03:14:13.227 --> 03:14:18.070]  And it won't matter if you live in Wyoming or Tennessee or any other red state currently.
[03:14:18.715 --> 03:14:22.919]  They are going to control the whole board the way that they do in California.
[03:14:22.919 --> 03:14:24.741]  The Republicans will be sidelined.
[03:14:24.741 --> 03:14:27.203]  They'll have no power, no impact.
[03:14:27.203 --> 03:14:35.311]  And I'm not saying this will lead then to gun confiscation and some kind of a Bolshevik revolution.
[03:14:35.311 --> 03:14:38.935]  What it's going to lead to, though, is a civil war.
[03:14:38.935 --> 03:14:40.216]  Absolutely for a fact.
[03:14:40.766 --> 03:14:45.838]  And our adversaries are just too stupid to realize this.
[03:14:45.838 --> 03:14:49.928]  And it's not only happening right now in America with this Kalazoela plan.
[03:14:51.360 --> 03:14:53.542]  It's happening in the UK.
[03:14:53.542 --> 03:15:01.828]  You can see where the Brexit deal, the elites, including Theresa May and all the rest, the elites are selling out the people.
[03:15:01.828 --> 03:15:03.869]  They're supposed to be on March 29th.
[03:15:03.869 --> 03:15:06.151]  If there's no deal, a hard Brexit.
[03:15:06.151 --> 03:15:08.472]  Well, this is once again with the EU.
[03:15:08.472 --> 03:15:15.277]  They vote until the EU gets the result that it wants, and it can't ever be accepted that Britain is going to leave.
[03:15:15.277 --> 03:15:19.700]  In France, you've still got the Yellow Vest protests going on, where the police are
[03:15:20.763 --> 03:15:23.044]  You're doing everything short of lethal force.
[03:15:23.044 --> 03:15:29.068]  Blowing off hands, blinding people with exploding grenades that hit them in the face, that are aimed at the face.
[03:15:29.068 --> 03:15:31.810]  So this is not just a phenomenon in America.
[03:15:31.810 --> 03:15:37.393]  We thought with Trump winning, and with the Brexit vote, that the tide was going to turn.
[03:15:37.393 --> 03:15:40.915]  But the communists are not going down without a fight.
[03:15:41.463 --> 03:15:49.013]  And it's going to take a fight to keep this country free and hopefully to maybe someday make Europe free.
[03:15:49.013 --> 03:15:55.862]  And on the other side of the break, we'll come back and I'm going to talk about some other social media subjects.
[03:15:56.543 --> 03:15:58.184]  And maybe we'll get the phones waving now.
[03:15:58.184 --> 03:16:00.485]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[03:16:00.485 --> 03:16:01.606]  Get back to nature.

[03:16:57.745 --> 03:16:58.985]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:58.985 --> 03:17:02.907]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:02.907 --> 03:17:04.447]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:04.447 --> 03:17:07.388]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:07.388 --> 03:17:12.950]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:14.150]  I can help you, too.

[03:18:02.210 --> 03:18:05.213]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[03:18:05.213 --> 03:18:12.098]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[03:18:12.098 --> 03:18:13.218]  X2 is back.
[03:18:13.218 --> 03:18:14.019]  We got it.
[03:18:14.019 --> 03:18:15.700]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:17.281]  We rushed it into production.
[03:18:17.281 --> 03:18:18.062]  It's been bottled.
[03:18:18.062 --> 03:18:23.566]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin for
[03:18:23.626 --> 03:18:24.386]  We're good to go.

[03:18:47.901 --> 03:18:49.443]  They should write the supplements.
[03:18:49.443 --> 03:18:52.627]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:20:01.367 --> 03:20:03.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:29.435 --> 03:20:32.397]  Okay, just finishing up a thought that occurred to me.
[03:20:32.397 --> 03:20:50.050]  You know, this AOC, Cortez, what she's engaged in, and it's getting blatant, not only her, almost all of the radical communists-slash-democrats are now using straight from Hitler, Goebbels, the big lie.
[03:20:50.050 --> 03:20:57.255]  The main point, I think, of the interview with the Wells Fargo executive was so that AOC could screech about
[03:20:57.938 --> 03:20:59.559]  Putting children in cages.
[03:20:59.559 --> 03:21:00.480]  Children in cages.
[03:21:00.480 --> 03:21:01.781]  Children in cages.
[03:21:01.781 --> 03:21:04.643]  It's pure Hitler propaganda.
[03:21:04.643 --> 03:21:07.425]  Just keep repeating a big lie.
[03:21:07.425 --> 03:21:11.929]  And the Dunning-Kruger Democrats, the morons, they're laughing it up.
[03:21:11.929 --> 03:21:13.450]  Oh my God, Trump is evil.
[03:21:13.450 --> 03:21:15.431]  He's putting children in cages.
[03:21:15.431 --> 03:21:17.573]  The fact of it means nothing.
[03:21:17.573 --> 03:21:20.555]  The truth of it absolutely means nothing.
[03:21:20.555 --> 03:21:26.700]  And what I would like to say now, when you're being accused basically of, you know, torturing children,
[03:21:27.398 --> 03:21:28.599]  Everything but genocide.
[03:21:28.599 --> 03:21:31.000]  We're called racists, we're called Nazis.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:37.403]  Trump is called a Nazi after Charlottesville, which is, if you ever see the transcripts, 100% out of context.
[03:21:37.403 --> 03:21:42.506]  He never said the, you know, alt-right Nazis with the torches were good guys.
[03:21:42.506 --> 03:21:44.167]  It wasn't at all.
[03:21:44.167 --> 03:21:45.308]  But that's another big lie.
[03:21:45.308 --> 03:21:47.229]  They just say it, say it, and say it.
[03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:48.309]  And it sticks.
[03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:53.372]  So my reaction is, it's time to take off the gloves.
[03:21:53.372 --> 03:21:55.093]  Just like the Islamists.
[03:21:55.808 --> 03:21:57.990]  The communists lie.
[03:21:57.990 --> 03:22:06.916]  Their secular religion of communism has Takiyah exactly the same like the Jihad Islamists.
[03:22:06.916 --> 03:22:12.980]  If it furthers communism, then you can deny you're a communist, just like you can deny you're an Islamist.
[03:22:12.980 --> 03:22:14.421]  I'm a moderate Muslim.
[03:22:14.981 --> 03:22:19.445]  You can say I'm just a moderate dem-dem-dem-soc-democrat-socialist.
[03:22:19.445 --> 03:22:20.746]  I'm not a communist.
[03:22:20.746 --> 03:22:25.510]  Every time I would hammer them, I-I personally call-call them communists.
[03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:27.792]  Call them lying communists.
[03:22:27.792 --> 03:22:39.322]  Point out to everyone that communists feel justified in lying because to them, the essential tenet of Marxism is the end justifies the means.
[03:22:39.322 --> 03:22:43.065]  So lying to gull us rubes out in flyover country?
[03:22:43.625 --> 03:22:45.748]  Is just a tactic.
[03:22:45.748 --> 03:22:48.651]  So there's no point in being polite back to these people.
[03:22:48.651 --> 03:22:50.533]  Call them communists.
[03:22:50.533 --> 03:22:57.341]  Remind everyone communists and socialists killed over a hundred million innocent people in the 20th century.
[03:22:58.522 --> 03:23:01.123]  And now they're lining up to do it again.
[03:23:01.123 --> 03:23:06.184]  AOC has the nerve to say that capitalism is unsustainable and irredeemable.
[03:23:06.184 --> 03:23:06.604]  Hello?
[03:23:06.604 --> 03:23:09.285]  Has she studied what's happening in Venezuela?
[03:23:09.285 --> 03:23:13.726]  The only solution for any country like Venezuela is the free market.
[03:23:13.726 --> 03:23:15.727]  I don't even like using the term capitalism.
[03:23:15.727 --> 03:23:18.108]  That's using the enemy vocabulary.
[03:23:18.108 --> 03:23:25.670]  It's free market economics, free, versus planned socialist economy, which always results in a disaster.
[03:23:26.190 --> 03:23:29.413]  But, it's not a disaster for the people in charge.
[03:23:29.413 --> 03:23:36.919]  If you're one of the elite, the people in the street can be eating each other, they can be diving in dumpsters, they can be selling children.
[03:23:36.919 --> 03:23:48.628]  It doesn't matter, because your hold on power becomes more strong, and you're always going to be able to use your secret police to hide the fact that you are still living the high life, flying helicopters and private jets.
[03:23:49.498 --> 03:23:52.039]  Just like North Korea, but hidden.
[03:23:52.039 --> 03:23:56.600]  Except instead of a starving North Korea, it's a starving Venezuela.
[03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:02.622]  So, when AOC should never get a free pass to say that socialism is the answer.
[03:24:02.622 --> 03:24:04.782]  Socialism is communism.
[03:24:04.782 --> 03:24:09.904]  The USSR was not called the Union of Communist Republics.
[03:24:09.904 --> 03:24:14.905]  It was called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
[03:24:14.905 --> 03:24:18.466]  A communist country, its name was socialist, not communist.
[03:24:19.108 --> 03:24:24.390]  And it's a central tenet of Marxism that socialism is just a pathway to communism.
[03:24:24.390 --> 03:24:27.931]  And we need to get on this and stay on it like a bulldog.
[03:24:27.931 --> 03:24:30.892]  Now, just a quick reminder about the InfoWars store.
[03:24:30.892 --> 03:24:35.833]  I know it goes on, but this can't be stated enough.
[03:24:35.833 --> 03:24:39.614]  There are fewer and fewer channels open for the truth.
[03:24:39.614 --> 03:24:45.616]  And the Alex Jones Show, that I'm privileged to be sitting here today, the Alex Jones Show is one of them.
[03:24:46.238 --> 03:24:59.829]  I mean, I just saw the clips that were put together that Alex showed last hour with the YouTube woman explaining why all these bans happened, and it's just ridiculous.
[03:24:59.829 --> 03:25:10.137]  They are willing to take things out of context, spin things 180 degrees, and use them as an excuse to shut down conservatives and libertarians.
[03:25:10.137 --> 03:25:11.778]  Meanwhile, Antifa?
[03:25:11.778 --> 03:25:12.639]  No holds barred.
[03:25:14.128 --> 03:25:24.575]  If you have a couple bucks and you want to keep a great program on the air, the Info Wars store is having a mega sale right now.
[03:25:24.575 --> 03:25:29.719]  Free shipping, double Patriot points, all supplements, 50% off.
[03:25:29.719 --> 03:25:31.981]  Free shipping, everything.
[03:25:31.981 --> 03:25:33.862]  Double Patriot points, everything.
[03:25:34.784 --> 03:25:41.406]  Brain Force, Survival Shield, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Power, Super Blue, 50% off everything.
[03:25:41.406 --> 03:25:48.247]  Now, I just, over the last couple days, I went to a funeral up in Virginia, driving from Florida, solo.
[03:25:48.247 --> 03:25:51.668]  I wish I had a picture of the back of my SUV.
[03:25:51.668 --> 03:25:55.389]  I had a, I had a SEAL Trident.
[03:25:55.389 --> 03:25:58.370]  I had a, a Infowars sticker.
[03:25:58.370 --> 03:26:00.470]  They're all on magnets, so I can pull them off.
[03:26:00.470 --> 03:26:02.011]  I'm not stupid.
[03:26:02.011 --> 03:26:03.711]  And I had a Gadsden flag.
[03:26:04.412 --> 03:26:07.534]  And I had a Trump Make America Great Again bumper sticker.
[03:26:07.534 --> 03:26:13.137]  So I must have been passed or passed 10,000 cars in that two day drive up and back.
[03:26:13.137 --> 03:26:14.738]  And I was proud to do it.
[03:26:14.738 --> 03:26:16.299]  You've got to get out and represent.
[03:26:16.299 --> 03:26:19.761]  What they're trying to do is cow us into silence.
[03:26:19.761 --> 03:26:22.663]  And this is what this is what's not only happening in America.
[03:26:22.663 --> 03:26:28.006]  If you've been following Tommy Robinson, if you haven't seen the video called Pano Drama,
[03:26:29.016 --> 03:26:36.140]  Which is named, it's a play on the word panorama, which is like a 60 minutes of the BBC.
[03:26:36.140 --> 03:26:40.702]  Tommy Robinson did a sting on these guys where they thought they were coming to interview him.
[03:26:40.702 --> 03:26:53.789]  And he had clips, undercover clips of these panorama executives talking about how they were going to lie about Tommy, splice things together, how the entire project was called Tommy Takedown.
[03:26:53.789 --> 03:26:56.091]  This was just the most brilliant video.
[03:26:56.091 --> 03:26:58.452]  Now Tommy's only up still on YouTube.
[03:26:59.051 --> 03:27:07.217]  When this video came out, he was kicked off of Facebook with the help of Islamist communist groups like Hope Not Hate.
[03:27:07.217 --> 03:27:09.698]  They always name themselves by a lie.
[03:27:09.698 --> 03:27:15.182]  He was taken right off of Facebook, he's been off of Twitter, he's taken off of Instagram.
[03:27:15.182 --> 03:27:21.866]  So what they're doing is they're cornering us, they're marginalizing us, they're pushing us into the edges.
[03:27:21.866 --> 03:27:24.308]  I myself, the day after Panodrama came out,
[03:27:25.282 --> 03:27:31.225]  I put a link on Facebook, just a link to a YouTube video which was not a banned YouTube video.
[03:27:31.225 --> 03:27:33.026]  It's still on YouTube.
[03:27:33.026 --> 03:27:41.529]  I put the Panadroma link up and I got my 7th 30-day Facebook suspension or ban in the last year and a half.
[03:27:41.529 --> 03:27:44.991]  So they give me basically a month, then they find a reason to kick me off for a month.
[03:27:45.555 --> 03:27:46.676]  And I don't know this time.
[03:27:46.676 --> 03:27:48.136]  It's like the day after St.
[03:27:48.136 --> 03:27:50.438]  Patrick's Day, I'm due to come out of the cooler.
[03:27:50.438 --> 03:27:52.519]  I'm like the cooler king on Facebook.
[03:27:52.519 --> 03:27:54.219]  I'm due to come out of the cooler.
[03:27:54.219 --> 03:27:57.141]  If somebody give me a baseball mitt, you know, like Steve McQueen.
[03:27:57.984 --> 03:28:02.229]  Anyway, I get back on Facebook in a few days, but I don't know if I'm gonna do it.
[03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:04.111]  Now, I just don't think that it's worth it.
[03:28:04.111 --> 03:28:06.053]  You're just begging to be on enemy territory.
[03:28:06.053 --> 03:28:08.896]  Like, people have suggested I go back to Twitter under a new name.
[03:28:08.896 --> 03:28:09.617]  I won't do it.
[03:28:09.617 --> 03:28:16.104]  I'm not gonna, you know, disguise myself and sneak into a club where they already threw me on the street.
[03:28:16.104 --> 03:28:16.885]  I just won't do it.
[03:28:17.498 --> 03:28:26.351]  So in the next segment, when we come back, I want to talk about some social media options and alternatives and strategies, where this is all going.
[03:28:26.351 --> 03:28:31.919]  Because clearly, they're trying to box us out, shut us down, and silence us.
[03:28:32.788 --> 03:28:44.236]  That's why it's so important that you support the Alex Jones Show, buy the products, be a contributor, and keep this going, because literally, we are holding the torch of freedom.
[03:28:44.236 --> 03:28:46.138]  If we don't, nobody will.
[03:28:46.138 --> 03:28:48.860]  The deep state rhino, they won't.
[03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:52.162]  They're on the side of their deep state, even though they might be Republicans.
[03:28:52.162 --> 03:28:53.043]  It's up to us.
[03:28:53.043 --> 03:28:54.604]  Nobody else will do it.
[03:28:54.604 --> 03:28:56.245]  When we come back, that's what we'll talk about.
[03:28:57.853 --> 03:29:01.434]  Pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:29:01.434 --> 03:29:05.015]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:05.015 --> 03:29:09.197]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?

[03:30:10.504 --> 03:30:17.148]  The number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:30:17.148 --> 03:30:27.273]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:30:27.273 --> 03:30:35.798]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:30:38.640 --> 03:30:41.242]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:30:41.242 --> 03:30:46.144]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:30:46.144 --> 03:30:47.665]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:30:47.665 --> 03:30:49.146]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:30:49.146 --> 03:30:55.830]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:57.311]  TurboForce at InforgedLife.com.
[03:30:58.889 --> 03:31:07.274]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:07.274 --> 03:31:08.735]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:08.735 --> 03:31:13.438]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:13.438 --> 03:31:16.520]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:31:17.000 --> 03:31:18.681]  I still have that energy.
[03:31:18.681 --> 03:31:38.833]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:39.333 --> 03:31:43.338]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[03:31:43.338 --> 03:31:47.002]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:47.002 --> 03:31:52.008]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[03:31:52.008 --> 03:31:54.771]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:54.771 --> 03:31:57.334]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:58.601 --> 03:32:04.064]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:32:04.064 --> 03:32:05.844]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:32:05.844 --> 03:32:07.605]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[03:32:07.605 --> 03:32:09.426]  Now, I can make them strong.
[03:32:09.426 --> 03:32:11.087]  Now, I can instruct them.
[03:32:11.087 --> 03:32:13.928]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[03:32:13.928 --> 03:32:19.030]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:32:19.030 --> 03:32:24.533]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:32:24.633 --> 03:32:28.255]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:32:28.255 --> 03:32:29.295]  I can't be destroyed now.
[03:32:29.295 --> 03:32:34.638]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[03:32:34.638 --> 03:32:43.923]  As long as you bind yourself to something, and commit to it, and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:32:43.923 --> 03:32:48.165]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos,
[03:32:48.345 --> 03:32:51.529]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:32:51.529 --> 03:32:54.753]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can.
[03:32:54.753 --> 03:33:02.323]  And realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:33:02.323 --> 03:33:04.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:21.535 --> 03:33:23.897]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:33:23.897 --> 03:33:31.341]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:31.341 --> 03:33:33.542]  Okay, I'm back.
[03:33:33.542 --> 03:33:35.283]  Yeah, and I see my books up there.
[03:33:35.283 --> 03:33:35.783]  That's cool.
[03:33:35.783 --> 03:33:45.649]  And if you want to red pill people, I suggest giving my books as gifts, either as a hard copy or Kindle or audiobook.
[03:33:45.649 --> 03:33:48.771]  They're on audiobook if you like to listen to books while you drive.
[03:33:50.189 --> 03:33:54.391]  Anyway, yeah, we're being boxed down step-by-step.
[03:33:54.391 --> 03:33:57.532]  I was talking about Tommy Robinson last segment.
[03:33:57.532 --> 03:34:06.575]  One of his books, Muhammad's Quran, Why Muslims Kill for Islam, has been taken off of Amazon.
[03:34:06.575 --> 03:34:17.479]  You can still find Mein Kampf, you can find all kind of jihad literature, but Tommy Robinson talking about the jihad threat to Europe and to the UK in particular can't be talked about.
[03:34:18.146 --> 03:34:30.016]  And you can see how the social media titans, they're happy to cooperate with these left-wing groups, like in the States, Southern Poverty Law Center, or over in the UK, Hope Not Hate.
[03:34:30.016 --> 03:34:30.977]  They're happy to.
[03:34:30.977 --> 03:34:33.459]  So, we're in a box.
[03:34:33.459 --> 03:34:35.340]  We're definitely in a box.
[03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:38.083]  We can still talk, but they're dialing down our output.
[03:34:38.083 --> 03:34:44.188]  You know, they're walking behind us with the wire cutters, clipping the cords, and yanking out the plugs.
[03:34:45.026 --> 03:34:46.867]  So it's really important.
[03:34:46.867 --> 03:34:49.047]  Support InfoWars.
[03:34:49.047 --> 03:34:51.148]  Keep InfoWars going.
[03:34:51.148 --> 03:34:52.408]  Super important.
[03:34:52.408 --> 03:34:54.469]  Support Tommy Robinson.
[03:34:54.469 --> 03:34:56.209]  Buy his book, Enemy of the State.
[03:34:56.209 --> 03:34:57.630]  It's still available.
[03:34:57.630 --> 03:34:58.430]  Buy my books.
[03:34:58.430 --> 03:35:02.231]  Buy anybody's books that has this vision that we share.
[03:35:02.231 --> 03:35:04.492]  Because it is important.
[03:35:04.492 --> 03:35:07.413]  It is all going down the tubes if we don't.
[03:35:07.413 --> 03:35:14.275]  And in the last few months, I've been searching all over the landscape for social media alternatives that can work.
[03:35:15.387 --> 03:35:21.311]  And there's a somebody very close to me was just booted off of YouTube.
[03:35:21.311 --> 03:35:24.813]  He's not as well known as Tommy Robinson.
[03:35:24.813 --> 03:35:28.136]  His name on the internet is Vlad Tepes.
[03:35:28.136 --> 03:35:31.078]  He lives in a country where he has to be very, very careful.
[03:35:31.078 --> 03:35:32.038]  Very careful.
[03:35:32.038 --> 03:35:33.940]  So anyway, I use my real name and face.
[03:35:33.940 --> 03:35:34.400]  He doesn't.
[03:35:34.400 --> 03:35:34.920]  He can't.
[03:35:34.920 --> 03:35:36.101]  He can't afford to.
[03:35:36.101 --> 03:35:40.264]  But what he has done is set up a website, an amazing website,
[03:35:40.925 --> 03:35:48.408]  Where he has connections to translators that can take a news clip from, I don't care if it's in Finnish.
[03:35:49.171 --> 03:35:53.434]  Or if it's in Bulgarian, the next day it'll be subtitled.
[03:35:53.434 --> 03:35:56.036]  So that it can be shared all around the world.
[03:35:56.036 --> 03:35:57.397]  You say, what difference does that make?
[03:35:57.397 --> 03:36:00.700]  A Swedish video, a video from Italy.
[03:36:00.700 --> 03:36:02.841]  I can't speak Swedish or Italian.
[03:36:02.841 --> 03:36:04.122]  Well, you don't need to.
[03:36:04.122 --> 03:36:07.805]  But it's important to understand this is not just an American phenomenon.
[03:36:07.805 --> 03:36:10.106]  This social media shunning.
[03:36:10.106 --> 03:36:13.429]  And Vlad, since he was kicked off of YouTube, check this out.
[03:36:13.971 --> 03:36:20.298]  He had 30,000 videos, most of them are like 2-5 minute clips, most of them, translated.
[03:36:20.298 --> 03:36:27.745]  30,000 videos, 30 million distinct views, often linked on InfoWars.
[03:36:27.745 --> 03:36:36.174]  They just shut him down, removed his channel, and deleted years worth of work, not just uploading videos, but arranging these translations.
[03:36:36.992 --> 03:36:39.094]  Until he just disappeared.
[03:36:39.094 --> 03:36:39.974]  So what's left?
[03:36:39.974 --> 03:36:50.281]  Well, there's BitChute, there's many other alternatives, but one that he's actually using right now is called Bit.tube.
[03:36:50.281 --> 03:36:53.003]  And it's a true BitTorrent.
[03:36:53.003 --> 03:36:57.106]  BitChute was sold as BitTorrent, but it really is using servers.
[03:36:58.363 --> 03:37:01.324]  And BitTube is a pure BitTorrent site.
[03:37:01.324 --> 03:37:10.465]  This is not rocket science, the BitTorrent theory has been around for a long time, but BitTube is trying to make a go of it using true BitTorrent technology.
[03:37:10.465 --> 03:37:19.647]  If you click on a video, after 10 or 15 seconds, as it's drawing in more of the torrent, the video will come up to very high def.
[03:37:19.647 --> 03:37:27.568]  Most BitShoot videos run at like 480, but you can use the sprocket and dial the def up as high as you want.
[03:37:28.374 --> 03:37:32.621]  And everybody that joins is part of it, but nobody's paying in.
[03:37:32.621 --> 03:37:37.188]  You're basically agreeing to be part of this sharing network.
[03:37:37.188 --> 03:37:38.851]  That's the essence of BitTorrent.
[03:37:39.551 --> 03:37:42.894]  It can't be shut down because there is no central server.
[03:37:42.894 --> 03:37:47.037]  There is no boss somewhere, you know, that has all the videos saved.
[03:37:47.037 --> 03:37:48.478]  The videos are in the cloud.
[03:37:48.478 --> 03:37:51.120]  The videos are shared between all our computers.
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:54.523]  So give bit.tube a look.
[03:37:54.523 --> 03:38:01.308]  And the guy I know, Vlad Tepes, he's trying to rebuild the 30,000 videos that were taken down by YouTube.
[03:38:01.308 --> 03:38:09.154]  If, and if this is a message from Vlad, if you have, if you can remember in particular great videos that you had saved and you can remember their titles,
[03:38:10.073 --> 03:38:23.224]  Contact me or contact Vlad through VladTepes.com VladTepesBlog.com and tell him and he'll re-upload the videos that really struck people onto Bit.Tube.
[03:38:23.224 --> 03:38:31.571]  But this is really super important because if we just play on the enemy terrain, we are just circling the drain.
[03:38:31.571 --> 03:38:36.936]  We have no chance unless we find our own way that's not subject to censorship.
[03:38:37.649 --> 03:38:52.413]  And, you know, there are not only BitTube, another one that is suggested now is something called Decenter.com, which is an offshoot of Gab, which has its own, you know, story.
[03:38:52.413 --> 03:38:56.614]  And Gab is still extremely viable for people that like Gab.
[03:38:58.221 --> 03:39:10.825]  I do recommend it for the people that enjoy it, but Gab has an offshoot called TheDissenter.com where people just post links to articles, so there's no problem with copyright or anything like that.
[03:39:10.825 --> 03:39:15.107]  In a fast computer era, it doesn't matter if you're just putting a link
[03:39:15.828 --> 03:39:18.509]  And then, then you can click between two windows.
[03:39:18.509 --> 03:39:20.830]  You can see the article, then make comments.
[03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:24.051]  And these comments are not going to be subject to censorship.
[03:39:24.051 --> 03:39:32.055]  Now, to keep them from being spammed and trolled, what the liberals do is, you know, they'll post, you know, uh, kiddie porn pictures, things like that.
[03:39:32.675 --> 03:39:37.900]  Then have Media Matters take a screen capture to try to shut down the conservative website.
[03:39:37.900 --> 03:39:39.421]  Remember, it's Alinsky Tactics.
[03:39:39.421 --> 03:39:41.323]  It's Mafia.
[03:39:41.323 --> 03:39:43.584]  Nothing is out of bounds for these guys.
[03:39:43.584 --> 03:39:45.006]  Nothing.
[03:39:45.006 --> 03:39:52.752]  So by using the dissenter.com, you're going around that and we'll see if this can stand up and survive.
[03:39:52.752 --> 03:39:53.933]  It's growing like crazy.
[03:39:53.933 --> 03:39:55.254]  It's really growing.
[03:39:55.254 --> 03:39:57.436]  And we'll see where it goes.
[03:39:57.436 --> 03:40:00.719]  But my point is, try to distribute
[03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:02.701]  The, um, your links.
[03:40:02.701 --> 03:40:05.362]  Try to distribute your information.
[03:40:05.362 --> 03:40:08.243]  One that I'm still on, FreeZoxy, it's still up.
[03:40:08.243 --> 03:40:12.625]  And, uh, you know, you can post links there, videos, etc.
[03:40:12.625 --> 03:40:15.346]  But, um, you know, I'm off of Twitter forever.
[03:40:15.346 --> 03:40:17.246]  I don't think I'll go back to Facebook.
[03:40:17.246 --> 03:40:19.707]  And we've all got to find an alternative.
[03:40:19.707 --> 03:40:24.929]  InfoWars itself is emerging as a pretty good social media platform in its own right.
[03:40:24.929 --> 03:40:27.670]  The point is, let's stop playing in enemy territory.
[03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:28.491]  I know Facebook is
[03:40:28.991 --> 03:40:40.642]  Got a lot of great attributes and all your families on it, so it makes it real easy to share political stuff with one family member and, you know, kitten memes with another family member.
[03:40:40.642 --> 03:40:45.907]  But when we're going to Facebook, we're putting money in Jeff Zuckerberg's pocket.
[03:40:46.777 --> 03:40:57.504]  You remember how he was back in Europe like two years ago, talking to Merkel and saying, yeah, we've got to do something about all this conservatism on the internet.
[03:40:57.504 --> 03:40:58.625]  And he's like, I'm with you.
[03:40:58.625 --> 03:41:00.166]  You know, we'll get rid of them.
[03:41:00.166 --> 03:41:00.927]  We'll take them down.
[03:41:00.927 --> 03:41:04.409]  That's a paraphrase, but that's what they meant.
[03:41:04.409 --> 03:41:05.670]  That was caught on an open mic.
[03:41:06.431 --> 03:41:11.374]  And, you know, we're just playing on enemy turf when we go there.
[03:41:11.374 --> 03:41:20.598]  So, anybody that contacts me, if you've got a better link, if you've got a better suggestion for video streaming, for social media, I'm all ears.
[03:41:20.598 --> 03:41:29.123]  Because this is really, in the emerging warfare leading up to 2020, political warfare I mean, internet warfare, electronic warfare,
[03:41:29.847 --> 03:41:32.528]  Social media is a key battlefield.
[03:41:32.528 --> 03:41:42.170]  And you can just imagine, as we get closer to 2020, how effective voices will be increasingly banned from left-wing social media.
[03:41:42.170 --> 03:41:52.652]  It doesn't take a rocket science to see that what happened to Infowars was just a beta test for doing this to more and more conservatives.
[03:41:52.652 --> 03:41:59.493]  First, they come for Alex Jones, then they come for Tommy Robinson, then they come for Matt Bracken, and there's no end to it.
[03:42:00.114 --> 03:42:05.559]  And something that drives me crazy, I still hear people talking about being the gray man.
[03:42:05.559 --> 03:42:11.444]  I'm just going to slide through this attempted Bolshevik revolution, which is probably going to lead to a civil war.
[03:42:11.444 --> 03:42:13.205]  I'm going to stay in the shadows.
[03:42:13.205 --> 03:42:15.027]  You know what I say that the gray man is?
[03:42:15.027 --> 03:42:16.768]  The gray man is a coward.
[03:42:16.768 --> 03:42:23.034]  Unless you got like six kids under ten years old and a job in the government maybe, but the gray man is a coward.
[03:42:23.494 --> 03:42:27.615]  The Gray Man ensures that the Communists are going to win.
[03:42:27.615 --> 03:42:32.017]  Because he won't come out of his hiding hole until the smoke has cleared.
[03:42:32.017 --> 03:42:36.838]  But while the smoke has cleared, there might be gulag barbed wire around his hole.
[03:42:36.838 --> 03:42:39.059]  And then what, Gray Man?
[03:42:39.059 --> 03:42:43.560]  So put your InfoWars bumper sticker on a magnet, if you want, like me.
[03:42:43.560 --> 03:42:46.501]  Put your MAGA bumper sticker on the back of your car.
[03:42:46.501 --> 03:42:48.022]  On a magnet, if it makes you feel better.
[03:42:48.442 --> 03:42:50.164]  But get out and present.
[03:42:50.164 --> 03:42:51.326]  Represent.
[03:42:51.326 --> 03:42:52.768]  Don't be a coward.
[03:42:52.768 --> 03:42:54.430]  Don't be the gray man.
[03:42:54.430 --> 03:42:57.614]  And I think we'll be coming back just in a few minutes.
[03:42:57.614 --> 03:43:00.297]  I've got some really good news though.
[03:43:00.297 --> 03:43:00.918]  X2's back.
[03:43:01.693 --> 03:43:06.337]  The Original X2 Deep Earth Crystal Pure Atomic Iodine.
[03:43:06.337 --> 03:43:07.438]  What you want.
[03:43:07.438 --> 03:43:08.559]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:08.559 --> 03:43:10.000]  It'll be here in a week.
[03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:11.541]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[03:43:11.541 --> 03:43:12.502]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:12.502 --> 03:43:14.324]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:43:14.324 --> 03:43:15.465]  X2 it's available.
[03:43:15.465 --> 03:43:16.446]  I thought X3 is great.
[03:43:16.446 --> 03:43:18.647]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[03:43:18.647 --> 03:43:20.469]  But I thought add the other two types of iodine.
[03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:21.390]  The scientists that do that.
[03:43:21.390 --> 03:43:23.632]  It's sold a lot but people want Original X2.
[03:43:24.452 --> 03:43:28.833]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:43:28.833 --> 03:43:32.914]  We now have X2 again, and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:43:32.914 --> 03:43:44.617]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[03:43:44.617 --> 03:43:47.938]  You want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there.

[03:47:01.901 --> 03:47:04.512]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.063 --> 03:47:44.190]  Okay, before I get off of social media and YouTube and all of that entirely, I did want to mention something still on YouTube, like Tommy Robinson, is one of the best videos I've seen in I don't know how long.
[03:47:44.190 --> 03:47:55.415]  For really good videos, I think you have to wait, because it takes a while for the inspiration and to produce them, and then life gets in the way, you know, there's, you can catch the flu, you can be on adult business trips, I get it.
[03:47:56.505 --> 03:48:05.291]  But Aaron Paul Joseph Watson, his newest video, which is up last night, is called The Collapse of Western Civilization.
[03:48:05.291 --> 03:48:13.417]  And not only should everybody in the InfoWars audience watch this video, I recommend that you share it.
[03:48:13.417 --> 03:48:18.361]  Share it with your family that aren't completely closed off to the potential of what's coming.
[03:48:18.361 --> 03:48:20.722]  I mean, it's so well done.
[03:48:20.722 --> 03:48:22.264]  It's just amazing.
[03:48:22.264 --> 03:48:25.446]  You know, I wish that I could do videos like that.
[03:48:26.204 --> 03:48:42.189]  I don't have the talent that he has, but I can at least push it, promote it, encourage people to share the links and save them on other video sites like BitChute and BitTube and the other ones.
[03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:44.970]  But watch the video and share it.
[03:48:44.970 --> 03:48:53.333]  It's literally about indicators going back through every civilization about the imminent collapse of that civilization.
[03:48:53.333 --> 03:48:55.614]  And Paul Joseph Watson just ticks them off.
[03:48:56.169 --> 03:49:01.855]  And has experts talking about each one in video clips inside of the video.
[03:49:01.855 --> 03:49:03.937]  But I can't recommend it too much.
[03:49:03.937 --> 03:49:05.318]  Please share it with your family.
[03:49:05.318 --> 03:49:10.544]  And if they think it's a joke, if they think you're being hyperbolic, at least it's been planted.
[03:49:10.544 --> 03:49:12.366]  The seed has been planted.
[03:49:12.366 --> 03:49:18.552]  And while I'm on YouTube, there are three other guys, at least three, I mean three that come off the top of my head.
[03:49:19.187 --> 03:49:23.608]  Black Pigeon Speaks, who's an American expat in Japan, I believe.
[03:49:23.608 --> 03:49:26.909]  He's not shown on camera, just his voice.
[03:49:26.909 --> 03:49:29.350]  His videos are brilliant.
[03:49:29.350 --> 03:49:32.811]  If you have the time, go back and surf through his videos.
[03:49:32.811 --> 03:49:33.831]  BPS.
[03:49:33.831 --> 03:49:35.292]  Black Pigeon Speaks.
[03:49:35.292 --> 03:49:35.912]  He's a genius.
[03:49:36.903 --> 03:49:46.769]  Sargon of Akkad, he's not exactly a conservative, but he's been very fair on the social media issue, you know, with the Rogan interview last week, etc.
[03:49:46.769 --> 03:49:48.110]  He's extremely fair.
[03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:54.174]  Sargon of Akkad, I look on my subscribed favorites for these guys every day.
[03:49:54.174 --> 03:50:01.859]  And right up there with Sargon, Black Pigeon Speaks, and Paul Joseph Watson, I put the Brit named Iconoclast.
[03:50:02.518 --> 03:50:04.219]  He's also just terrific.
[03:50:04.219 --> 03:50:06.100]  To me, these are the top tier.
[03:50:06.100 --> 03:50:11.043]  They make videos that are, you know, five, twelve minutes long, but they have something to say.
[03:50:11.043 --> 03:50:12.944]  These guys are geniuses.
[03:50:12.944 --> 03:50:27.271]  And you might not have the argument to give to your family member, your associates at work, but if you can drop the links in a non-judgmental way, just like, hey, check this out, you can red pill a lot of people.
[03:50:27.271 --> 03:50:29.513]  And that's the point of what we're doing here.
[03:50:29.513 --> 03:50:31.674]  It's not enough for us to preach to the choir.
[03:50:32.515 --> 03:50:45.846]  Coming to InfoWars, shopping in the InfoWars store, all of that's great, but if we're not rebroadcasting to the larger audience that doesn't watch, then we're not really doing our part.
[03:50:45.846 --> 03:50:54.533]  You know, Alex, David Knight, they're all doing all that they can, but promoting the video clips, you know, War Room with Owen,
[03:50:55.555 --> 03:50:57.917]  Promote the video clips, share them.
[03:50:57.917 --> 03:51:11.805]  You have it in the power, you know, millions of individuals have it in their power to relink these links and increase by many fold the number of eyes and minds that will be exposed to this information.
[03:51:11.805 --> 03:51:19.890]  It's not enough that you know, and you know what I think about you gray men, you know, hiding in your hole till the dust settles.
[03:51:19.890 --> 03:51:20.951]  It's too late for that.
[03:51:21.582 --> 03:51:22.823]  You've got to get out.
[03:51:22.823 --> 03:51:24.464]  You've got to stand up.
[03:51:24.464 --> 03:51:31.429]  You've got to not only be brave personally, you have to be brave for the other ones.
[03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:32.289]  For the other ones.
[03:51:32.289 --> 03:51:38.934]  You know, there's a reason those, you know, the lieutenants would go over the top first, just with a whistle and a pistol.
[03:51:38.934 --> 03:51:43.237]  Because the enlisted men aren't going to go if the lieutenant and the captain are hiding.
[03:51:43.237 --> 03:51:46.979]  You've got to be the brave man, not the gray man.
[03:51:46.979 --> 03:51:50.722]  If you're waiting for John Wayne, he's not coming.
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:55.803]  If you're waiting for Paul Revere, he's already come a hundred times.
[03:51:55.803 --> 03:51:58.945]  Now is the time to stand up and blow your own horn.
[03:51:58.945 --> 03:52:06.751]  I mean, if you're too chicken to put a magnetized InfoWars or MAGA bumper sticker on your car, good grief!
[03:52:06.751 --> 03:52:10.013]  What's gonna happen when they're doing red flags and people are getting shot?
[03:52:10.013 --> 03:52:12.134]  Are you suddenly gonna get brave then?
[03:52:12.134 --> 03:52:12.935]  How's that work?
[03:52:12.935 --> 03:52:14.656]  I've never seen that happen in my life.
[03:52:14.656 --> 03:52:18.699]  If you're too afraid to wear the t-shirt, the InfoWars t-shirt,
[03:52:19.459 --> 03:52:23.720]  If you're too afraid now, you think you'll suddenly be so brave you'll be digging up your gun?
[03:52:23.720 --> 03:52:25.140]  No you won't.
[03:52:25.140 --> 03:52:27.481]  You'll be hiding until we're Bolshevized.
[03:52:27.481 --> 03:52:30.422]  So now is the time to be brave.
[03:52:30.422 --> 03:52:36.763]  And this brings me up to Donald Trump and our great hopes for him when he was elected.
[03:52:36.763 --> 03:52:41.124]  Number one, he was our great hope because he was not Hillary Clinton.
[03:52:41.124 --> 03:52:45.505]  If Hillary had won, the deep state coup would have been a complete success.
[03:52:46.573 --> 03:53:02.035]  The plan, as we now know, from the Page and Strzok released interviews, the congressman just released these PDF files, the plan was, this was probably, you know, you can read between the lines, this was the Tormach deal plan.
[03:53:02.035 --> 03:53:02.817]  Hillary wins.
[03:53:03.507 --> 03:53:14.294]  Loretta Lynch stays on as Attorney General, so she can continue to hide and cover up all the crimes, Uranium One, everything else, Fast and Furious, all the crimes.
[03:53:14.294 --> 03:53:18.116]  She can continue to be the Crypt Keeper of Democrat crimes.
[03:53:18.116 --> 03:53:26.902]  Comey stays on as FBI Director, and when he's had enough, he's going to give it to McCabe, the trusted Andrew McCabe, Deep State SES operative.
[03:53:27.620 --> 03:53:30.182]  And they will just keep the same game playing.
[03:53:30.182 --> 03:53:32.124]  Well, Trump was the great disruptor.
[03:53:32.124 --> 03:53:33.465]  He blew that up.
[03:53:33.465 --> 03:53:39.010]  That's why Strzok and Page were texting each other about, you know, the menace that he is.
[03:53:39.010 --> 03:53:43.034]  And thank God that those emails, those text messages were recovered.
[03:53:43.034 --> 03:53:48.378]  Now, in the last two days, I read both the Page and Strzok testimonies.
[03:53:48.378 --> 03:53:53.603]  It's not as dull as it looks when you open that PDF script file, but
[03:53:54.275 --> 03:54:10.004]  If you just are looking for like, you know, Meadows and Jordan, and you skip the, you know, the Democrat-Communist, because, you know, they're just going to be saying, you know, isn't it terrible that the FBI is losing its respect because of those horrible conservatives?
[03:54:10.004 --> 03:54:11.264]  So just scroll past that.
[03:54:11.264 --> 03:54:13.085]  That cuts the reading in half.
[03:54:13.085 --> 03:54:19.189]  And you can clearly see they had this all planned out, and Trump blew up the plan.
[03:54:20.780 --> 03:54:22.601]  Since he was elected, how has he been doing?
[03:54:22.601 --> 03:54:23.922]  How much wall is being built?
[03:54:23.922 --> 03:54:26.083]  He says that the wall is being built.
[03:54:26.083 --> 03:54:30.966]  The emergency resolution, the vote on the emergency resolution, I guess that's today.
[03:54:30.966 --> 03:54:32.106]  I don't know if it's going to happen.
[03:54:32.106 --> 03:54:34.948]  I haven't been keeping track.
[03:54:34.948 --> 03:54:42.472]  But ever since 2016 in the election, we've been led on with false hopes, gulling the roofs.
[03:54:42.472 --> 03:54:43.913]  First, it was Stealth Jeff.
[03:54:44.645 --> 03:54:49.087]  Jeff Sessions wasn't really just, you know, the legend of Sleepy Hollow.
[03:54:49.087 --> 03:54:55.249]  He was actually a tornado hidden, and he's going to come out any day and lay the Deep State coup bare.
[03:54:55.249 --> 03:54:56.269]  False.
[03:54:56.269 --> 03:55:02.591]  QAnon, in my opinion, total hoax from day one, just like, you know, many other hoaxes in the past.
[03:55:02.591 --> 03:55:06.132]  The Hitler Diaries, Howard Hughes Diaries, etc.
[03:55:06.132 --> 03:55:07.313]  Total hoax.
[03:55:07.313 --> 03:55:13.935]  And I really hate hoaxes because, you know, if you want to write fiction, be a novelist, put it in a book, call it fiction.
[03:55:15.245 --> 03:55:16.846]  So, nothing came out of QAnon.
[03:55:16.846 --> 03:55:21.947]  All the promises about the eventual exposure of the Deep State coup.
[03:55:21.947 --> 03:55:22.927]  Then there's Huber.
[03:55:22.927 --> 03:55:23.987]  Oh, Huber's coming in.
[03:55:23.987 --> 03:55:25.607]  We've got a guy out in Utah.
[03:55:25.607 --> 03:55:27.448]  He's going to get to the bottom of it.
[03:55:27.448 --> 03:55:37.230]  And now the latest of these, hopefully not this time, of falsehoods is Attorney General Barr is now supposedly in command.
[03:55:37.230 --> 03:55:41.731]  And he looks like a guy that's quite the opposite of Sleepy Stealth Jeff.
[03:55:44.002 --> 03:55:48.906]  I think that it's no accident that Weissman quit or announced he's quitting today.
[03:55:48.906 --> 03:55:53.009]  And I use an analogy to a poker game.
[03:55:53.009 --> 03:55:58.193]  If Mueller is at the poker table, he's got the big hand that everybody expects has four aces.
[03:55:58.193 --> 03:56:01.556]  Or at least that's what the left-wing media is hoping.
[03:56:01.556 --> 03:56:04.999]  That's what the Democrats are hoping.
[03:56:04.999 --> 03:56:07.741]  And it's looking increasingly like there's nothing there.
[03:56:07.741 --> 03:56:09.322]  I mean, elsewise, wouldn't it have leaked?
[03:56:10.669 --> 03:56:15.518]  But then where everybody's saying, well, why doesn't just Trump just declassify everything?
[03:56:15.518 --> 03:56:17.321]  It's in his power to declassify.
[03:56:17.321 --> 03:56:18.663]  Well, it's a poker game.
[03:56:18.663 --> 03:56:21.769]  It's the sequence of who lays down cards is very important.
[03:56:22.651 --> 03:56:28.435]  Trump isn't going to declassify until the Mueller, the definitive Mueller report is out and digested.
[03:56:28.435 --> 03:56:30.316]  Then I think he'll declassify.
[03:56:30.316 --> 03:56:48.889]  But short of that, this congressman that released publicly the then classified or confidential transcripts of the Page and the Strzok testimony, what he's doing is throwing down another card, which Mueller has to react to, and with Weissman quitting now,
[03:56:49.961 --> 03:57:00.029]  And we can only imagine what's been going on now between Barr and Mueller and Weissman, all of these characters, the congressional committees.
[03:57:00.029 --> 03:57:02.511]  We don't know because they know a lot more than we do.
[03:57:02.511 --> 03:57:04.673]  And so what we can see through the keyhole,
[03:57:06.554 --> 03:57:10.936]  What we can see is what looks like a game being played of timing.
[03:57:10.936 --> 03:57:14.517]  Weissman quitting, they may be going into CYA mode.
[03:57:14.517 --> 03:57:16.757]  Weissman may be luring up pretty soon.
[03:57:16.757 --> 03:57:22.499]  Because, for sure, Lindsey Graham, Mark Meadows, Jeff Jordan, they're not going to let go of this phone.
[03:57:22.499 --> 03:57:24.320]  They're going to tear it up.
[03:57:24.320 --> 03:57:26.160]  Now we'll see what can come of it.
[03:57:26.160 --> 03:57:28.101]  But I don't think that they're on the lease.
[03:57:28.101 --> 03:57:31.902]  I think in the transcripts, Trey Gowdy was terrific.
[03:57:31.902 --> 03:57:33.023]  But he's quit.
[03:57:33.023 --> 03:57:33.943]  I guess Trey's, you know...
[03:57:35.879 --> 03:57:37.479]  ...TV career or something.
[03:57:37.479 --> 03:57:43.062]  But, you know, the real heroes, the Jordans and the Meadows, they are fighters.
[03:57:43.062 --> 03:57:43.843]  They are fighters.
[03:57:43.843 --> 03:57:45.684]  And we're just coming up now to the big...
[03:57:46.761 --> 03:57:48.082]  The big culmination of the game.
[03:57:48.082 --> 03:57:49.922]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[03:57:49.922 --> 03:57:52.984]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:57:52.984 --> 03:58:01.548]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:58:01.548 --> 03:58:04.509]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:58:04.509 --> 03:58:06.270]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:58:06.270 --> 03:58:12.532]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[03:58:19.946 --> 03:58:22.908]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:58:22.908 --> 03:58:26.531]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:58:26.531 --> 03:58:30.814]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:58:30.814 --> 03:58:32.636]  I've got two in my home.

[03:58:38.740 --> 03:58:39.561]  Don't live

[03:58:44.463 --> 03:58:49.167]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:49.167 --> 03:58:52.249]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:58:52.249 --> 03:58:55.212]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:55.212 --> 03:58:58.134]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
