[00:00.000 --> 00:08.800]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.800 --> 00:11.840]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:11.840 --> 00:23.920]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[00:23.920 --> 00:27.840]  It is Sunday, June 20, 2010.
[00:27.840 --> 00:30.720]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:30.720 --> 00:39.160]  We are also simulcasting this radio broadcast at PrismPlanet.tv.
[00:39.160 --> 00:44.240]  I am going to attempt today to cover all of the news and information as we do each and
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.200]  every day, but it's getting more and more intense by the millisecond, as you know.
[00:49.200 --> 00:54.280]  The quickening is accelerating, but we're going to cover it all.
[00:54.280 --> 01:05.840]  First off, we're almost two months into the oil spill right now, and there is no doubt
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.200]  from the research that we've done that this is an inside job, an act of sabotage, a staged
[01:11.200 --> 01:12.200]  event.
[01:12.200 --> 01:18.640]  The question is, why did the federal government controlled by offshore banks and BP controlled
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.560]  by the king of the offshore banks, Goldman Sachs, why did they do this?
[01:24.560 --> 01:30.320]  And I'll be breaking this down in a special analysis starting in the next segment.
[01:30.320 --> 01:32.740]  This information is vitally important.
[01:32.740 --> 01:42.760]  We are calling for a criminal investigation at the state level because the feds are completely
[01:42.760 --> 01:50.760]  controlled 100% by the individuals that have clearly orchestrated.
[01:50.760 --> 02:00.720]  This is part of their strategic takeover, their stratagem.
[02:00.720 --> 02:08.280]  States need to launch criminal investigation into BP federal government's role in oil spill.
[02:08.280 --> 02:14.360]  And we've got the phone numbers to the governors that border the gulf that are affected by
[02:14.360 --> 02:16.480]  the spill.
[02:16.480 --> 02:22.360]  Texas will be affected once the hurricane season hits and blows it against the currents.
[02:22.360 --> 02:29.840]  So we probably should add Texas to this list, but right now we have Florida, of course,
[02:29.840 --> 02:35.760]  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and when it goes around Florida it will then be carried
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.280]  by those currents into the east coast and then on out into the Atlantic, into Iceland,
[02:42.280 --> 02:44.720]  England, and northern Europe.
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.600]  Very, very serious situation, obviously.
[02:47.600 --> 02:53.120]  And we're going to be breaking that down when we come back from the first break.
[02:53.120 --> 02:59.560]  We have Medvedev, the Russian president, showing off a sample coin for the New World
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.680]  currency.
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.480]  Remember he did that a year ago?
[03:03.480 --> 03:10.360]  Well now he's back, Medvedev pushes ruble currency to replace dollar dominance.
[03:10.360 --> 03:16.680]  And he did that, of course, on Friday, calling for a Russian-based New World order.
[03:16.680 --> 03:22.480]  I've got more on the situation with the attack on free speech.
[03:22.480 --> 03:28.760]  The government is now openly saying that the FCC is going to take the web over and that
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.440]  all internet connections, all cell phones, all television sets will have a government
[03:34.440 --> 03:39.600]  internet control box that tracks everything you do, everywhere you go, and decides what
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.960]  you can have access to.
[03:40.960 --> 03:46.280]  I actually had the legislation in Congress here in front of me, but the FCC says they
[03:46.280 --> 03:48.040]  don't care if it doesn't pass.
[03:48.040 --> 03:50.920]  This is new FCC regulations.
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.440]  They might as well say that they regulate the moon, or how about Pluto or the Kuiper
[03:55.440 --> 03:56.440]  Belt?
[03:56.440 --> 03:58.600]  I mean, they do not have this jurisdiction.
[03:58.600 --> 04:00.880]  So get ready for the end of free speech.
[04:00.880 --> 04:05.880]  And that's what they're saying this is for, because they are moving with their tyranny
[04:05.880 --> 04:10.240]  on every front and they want to shut down our free speech.
[04:10.240 --> 04:16.960]  We are also going to get into what is probably the most important news.
[04:16.960 --> 04:21.320]  The oil spill is very important and is a close second.
[04:21.320 --> 04:26.040]  And it's really part of the story as well, because it's being used as a mass diversion,
[04:26.040 --> 04:32.080]  a mass distraction from the Iran developments.
[04:32.080 --> 04:37.960]  U.S.-Israel warships in Suez may be prepared to face off with Iran.
[04:37.960 --> 04:43.160]  That's out of the Israeli national news.
[04:43.160 --> 04:46.280]  We, of course, reported on this four days ago.
[04:46.280 --> 04:47.560]  People doubted it.
[04:47.560 --> 04:50.120]  The Iranian news reported on it five days ago.
[04:50.120 --> 04:51.800]  But here's the Israeli press.
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.520]  Armada of U.S. and Israeli warships headed for Iran.
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.960]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships if suggested to cargo inspection.
[04:58.960 --> 04:59.960]  This is serious.
[04:59.960 --> 05:03.280]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[05:03.280 --> 05:07.640]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[05:07.640 --> 05:08.640]  do you want?
[05:08.640 --> 05:10.640]  My answer would be all I can get.
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.680]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[05:15.680 --> 05:16.920]  How much do you want?
[05:16.920 --> 05:17.920]  When do you want it?
[05:17.920 --> 05:19.920]  Now or after the battle starts?
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.040]  When will you need it?
[05:21.040 --> 05:23.160]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[05:23.160 --> 05:24.520]  Will there be any food?
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.960]  Will it make your children sick?
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.120]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.280]  and be immunized?
[05:31.280 --> 05:35.040]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[05:35.040 --> 05:38.640]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[05:38.640 --> 05:39.880]  How much will you need?
[05:39.880 --> 05:40.880]  We don't know.
[05:40.880 --> 05:41.880]  How much do you want?
[05:41.880 --> 05:42.880]  All you can get.
[05:42.880 --> 05:43.880]  I'm Alex Jones.
[05:43.880 --> 05:46.920]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[05:46.920 --> 05:54.400]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:54.400 --> 06:05.400]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[06:05.400 --> 06:10.200]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-offs.
[06:10.200 --> 06:11.200]  You want answers?
[06:11.200 --> 06:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[06:13.320 --> 06:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:17.520 --> 06:25.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[06:25.240 --> 06:34.200]  Thank you for joining us, my friends.
[06:34.200 --> 06:39.480]  It is Sunday, the 20th day of June, 2000, and Tim are going to be here live for the
[06:39.480 --> 06:40.480]  next two hours.
[06:40.480 --> 06:46.680]  I'm going to get into this giant stack of mainstream news, openly announcing, but like
[06:46.680 --> 06:51.960]  it's no big deal, that the federal government is taking over the internet and free speech
[06:51.960 --> 06:59.280]  and will restrict free speech, including free speech supporting the Second Amendment.
[06:59.280 --> 07:01.920]  The news is that this is now mainstream news.
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.200]  I've been telling you for the last two years, at the end of Bush and now at the start of
[07:06.200 --> 07:11.600]  Obama, that all the federal agencies have been openly saying, we've got to shut up
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.480]  the American people.
[07:13.480 --> 07:16.520]  They know they're doing things that are unconstitutional, that are criminal.
[07:16.520 --> 07:21.320]  There is a private offshore corporate takeover taking place in the United States right now.
[07:21.320 --> 07:22.720]  You think things are bad.
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.440]  You ain't see nothing yet as the adage goes.
[07:26.440 --> 07:28.000]  And so they need to shut us up.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.440]  I have the Associated Press today with federal and state governments grabbing people's private
[07:33.440 --> 07:36.960]  pension funds and cutting government pension funds.
[07:36.960 --> 07:42.360]  Do you think they're going to let you have any voice while they financially gang rape
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.360]  you?
[07:43.360 --> 07:45.720]  The answer is no.
[07:45.720 --> 07:48.160]  This is hot tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:48.160 --> 07:51.920]  But finally, not cold creeping tyranny anymore.
[07:51.920 --> 07:57.960]  Here's the Financial Times of London, FCC and move to regulate internet.
[07:57.960 --> 08:00.280]  And then I have the FCC quotes.
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.320]  This is outside of law, just a new regulation.
[08:03.320 --> 08:08.480]  I mean, I guess the FCC might have a new regulation that your drapes have to be purple.
[08:08.480 --> 08:11.760]  Of course, they don't have that jurisdiction, but why not if they don't have jurisdiction
[08:11.760 --> 08:12.760]  on this?
[08:12.760 --> 08:15.960]  How about the FCC says you got to wear blue underwear on Tuesdays.
[08:15.960 --> 08:17.400]  They don't have any jurisdiction to do that.
[08:17.400 --> 08:18.400]  But why not?
[08:18.400 --> 08:23.320]  I mean, how about we've all got to pay a internet and television tax to the FCC?
[08:23.320 --> 08:26.000]  Now, I'm not being sarcastic now.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.840]  That is in a bill in Congress and in their new regulation, which they don't even need
[08:29.840 --> 08:36.480]  a law to implement, they claim, that you will pay a tax on your television set and your
[08:36.480 --> 08:37.480]  computer.
[08:37.480 --> 08:45.720]  Oh, what did Cass Sunstein two years ago as a Harvard lawyer, right now the head of regulation,
[08:45.720 --> 08:51.240]  Obama's regulations are, he said, we will tax the alternative media into oblivion.
[08:51.240 --> 08:56.280]  We will then in the next phase arrest people for alternative views.
[08:56.280 --> 08:59.480]  These are quotes, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.480]  What is his diversity?
[09:00.480 --> 09:08.120]  These are at the FCC say that Mao Zedong is good, that Hugo Chavez censorship of the media
[09:08.120 --> 09:09.120]  is good.
[09:09.120 --> 09:10.120]  This is really happening.
[09:10.120 --> 09:13.240]  Oh, you didn't think government would seize health care and, of course, raise taxes cut
[09:13.240 --> 09:19.320]  benefits and all the pathetic Obama supporters are saying, where's my free health care?
[09:19.320 --> 09:20.480]  You're not going to get any health care.
[09:20.480 --> 09:21.480]  Okay.
[09:21.480 --> 09:22.480]  You understand that?
[09:22.480 --> 09:23.480]  Maybe an aspirin for a heart attack.
[09:23.480 --> 09:25.520]  You're going to live like they do in Cuba now.
[09:25.520 --> 09:27.320]  You're going to eat squid three times a day.
[09:27.320 --> 09:31.400]  You're going to have a chivano in every corner telling you what to eat, how to sleep, who
[09:31.400 --> 09:34.400]  to talk to, what to wear, how long to work.
[09:34.400 --> 09:35.560]  You want to be a slave?
[09:35.560 --> 09:39.680]  You want daddy government, big brother government to wipe your hind end for you?
[09:39.680 --> 09:42.760]  They will, right after they hit you in the head with a baseball bat.
[09:42.760 --> 09:43.760]  You want to be a slave?
[09:43.760 --> 09:44.760]  Okay.
[09:44.760 --> 09:45.760]  You hate America?
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.840]  You want to go in the opposite direction of our founding fathers?
[09:47.840 --> 09:50.480]  You'll learn why that was a bad idea now.
[09:50.480 --> 09:53.440]  FCC and move to regulate the internet.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.440]  Financial Times of London.
[09:54.440 --> 09:56.240]  Here's another one.
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.120]  Look at Kurt Nemo article from infowars.com, but it links to the FCC announcements.
[10:01.120 --> 10:03.920]  It links to the mainstream news articles.
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.360]  It links to just scores of articles documenting all of this.
[10:09.360 --> 10:11.200]  So go read it for yourself.
[10:11.200 --> 10:14.640]  FCC stealth plan to censor internet content.
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.480]  I wouldn't even really call it a stealth plan.
[10:16.480 --> 10:19.560]  I mean, the Financial Times of London admits what it is.
[10:19.560 --> 10:25.680]  In order to control the internet and do so without much notice, the FCC has rolled a
[10:25.680 --> 10:32.200]  censorship plan into its net neutrality scheme under the fallacious rubric of consumer protection.
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.400]  The FCC is calling for the regulation of television and internet broadband.
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.440]  Kelly William Cobb, writing for Americans for Tax Reform says, quote, the FCC would
[10:41.440 --> 10:48.320]  begin regulating internet access for the first time under a completely new regulatory scheme,
[10:48.320 --> 10:50.800]  even though they lack the authority to create it.
[10:50.800 --> 10:56.040]  Meanwhile, the FCC would push regulations cloaked in the heartwarming language of competition
[10:56.040 --> 11:02.000]  and innovation, mandating that your cable box, known as a set top box, become a broadband
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.440]  gateway device controlling access to your internet, TV and phone.
[11:06.440 --> 11:12.280]  The FCC has already started looking at a setup box regulations in their national broadband
[11:12.280 --> 11:13.280]  plan.
[11:13.280 --> 11:17.400]  And then if you link through and actually read what they have announced on the FCC website,
[11:17.400 --> 11:21.600]  it says there'll be a tax on you for using the box.
[11:21.600 --> 11:26.880]  Just like for 50 years, they've had a, on average, what, 200 pound a year or so tax
[11:26.880 --> 11:29.320]  for radio and TV in England.
[11:29.320 --> 11:34.960]  Oh, and they have actual people that go around in vans spying on you to see if you're watching
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.800]  TV or listening to the radio without paying your tax.
[11:37.800 --> 11:38.800]  You think I'm joking?
[11:38.800 --> 11:39.800]  Go look into it.
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.600]  That's actually what the FCC says.
[11:41.600 --> 11:45.480]  They said, like the BBC, a quote, government megaphone.
[11:45.480 --> 11:50.640]  The media will now be taxed and the money from it will fund government media in the
[11:50.640 --> 11:52.080]  U.S. openly.
[11:52.080 --> 12:00.280]  Under the FCC's regulatory control, consumers would be forced to buy an internet TV phone
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.760]  connectivity box that the government approves.
[12:04.760 --> 12:12.360]  Again, under the FCC's regulatory control, consumers would be forced to buy an internet
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.240]  TV phone connectivity box that the government approves.
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.280]  Everyone will pay rates for service that the government sets.
[12:19.280 --> 12:24.520]  The, at everything passing through your internet TV and phone would become subject to the FCC's
[12:24.520 --> 12:27.560]  constant regulatory whim, writes Cobb.
[12:27.560 --> 12:31.360]  It continues, the FCC's controlled television content for decades.
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.080]  If you want to know what the heavy hand of government will do to internet content, think
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.320]  of the absurd Janet Jackson incident and the government response, the government wants
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.920]  to make sure the flow of information is safe for consumption by the PLABS.
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.920]  Broadcast and cable television do not offer an alternative to news and information provided
[12:51.920 --> 12:52.920]  by the corporate media.
[12:52.920 --> 12:57.600]  The FCC plan a government oversight of content would effectively kill off alternative news,
[12:57.600 --> 12:59.160]  information and commentary.
[12:59.160 --> 13:04.120]  If the FCC gets its way, Obama will not need a kill switch, as he's now admitted they have,
[13:04.120 --> 13:05.440]  installed in the Oval Office.
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.200]  The internet will ultimately become a pale reflection of corporate dominated television
[13:09.200 --> 13:11.840]  where there are hundreds of channels and nothing on.
[13:11.840 --> 13:15.520]  That is nothing that challenges the government and offers an alternative to the corporate
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.520]  media.
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.160]  Now, why is this so serious?
[13:20.160 --> 13:28.760]  Because you have a perfect storm of government mega corporations being exposed by alternative
[13:28.760 --> 13:37.240]  media and you have mainstream media losing its ratings to the alternative media and literally
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.960]  dying already in cardiac arrest, newspapers, TV, you name it, because the people's voice
[13:42.960 --> 13:44.280]  can't be heard there.
[13:44.280 --> 13:51.160]  Talk radio is old media, it's surviving because it's more electronic soapbox type format and
[13:51.160 --> 13:52.600]  long form.
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.400]  So internet's exploding, taking everything over, talk radio's kind of merging with it
[13:56.400 --> 13:59.280]  and surviving, everything else is dying.
[13:59.280 --> 14:05.360]  And so you have mainstream media, Time Magazine, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, New York Times
[14:05.360 --> 14:11.200]  all calling for internet censorship and to shut down and tax and regulate the alternative
[14:11.200 --> 14:16.040]  media because we're kicking their hind ends, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.400]  When my articles get quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Drudge Report and the
[14:20.400 --> 14:26.000]  Associated Press in the last week alone, the system is scared.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.360]  When infowars.com and prisonplanet.com receive millions of individual visitors a week and
[14:31.360 --> 14:34.040]  are exponentially growing, the system is scared.
[14:34.040 --> 14:41.160]  And they actually name me on MSNBC and imply that I'm trying to cause a violent overthrow
[14:41.160 --> 14:47.160]  of the government and that I need to be silenced and that my free speech is dangerous.
[14:47.160 --> 14:52.600]  Well if they can knock off Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh, they can knock
[14:52.600 --> 14:53.600]  anybody off.
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.920]  So understand we are canaries in the coal mine and we've all got to stand together or
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.400]  we'll surely hang separate, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[15:03.400 --> 15:06.600]  But listen, I'm not done.
[15:06.600 --> 15:12.640]  And Janet Napolitano, internet monitoring needed to fight homegrown terrorism.
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.240]  When you read the cyber security bill that's passed the House in the Senate, already being
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.680]  implemented without it being passed for the last four years under Bush and now Obama, giant
[15:21.680 --> 15:26.520]  NSA bases built all over the country, including one in San Antonio, San Antonio paper try to
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.120]  go cover it, police come out and detain them or arrest them.
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.280]  This is on the news, you can watch those videos online.
[15:34.280 --> 15:39.200]  They openly say all internet service companies who have a hundred or more customers must
[15:39.200 --> 15:41.840]  wire all their equipment through the government.
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.760]  Same thing, all your internet in your house will be wired through a government snooping,
[15:45.760 --> 15:48.880]  tracking, blocking system.
[15:48.880 --> 15:50.120]  Worse than Communist China.
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.040]  I mean folks, this is worse than Communist China.
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.440]  There they just block it at the main ISPs.
[15:55.440 --> 16:01.920]  This is a block at the ISPs, but also in your house.
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.440]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new ten hour documentary and survival
[16:06.440 --> 16:08.360]  guide rolled into one.

[18:02.560 --> 18:08.120]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.200]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[18:12.200 --> 18:13.200]  documents.
[18:13.200 --> 18:17.680]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[18:17.680 --> 18:20.160]  It means all the world under their control.
[18:20.160 --> 18:22.920]  The United Nations would take over America.
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.240]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[18:26.240 --> 18:31.160]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[18:31.160 --> 18:33.680]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[18:33.680 --> 18:38.120]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[18:38.120 --> 18:39.120]  financial system.
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.040]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[18:42.040 --> 18:45.720]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.

[20:02.320 --> 20:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:05.400 --> 20:09.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:09.640 --> 20:11.420]  Network.
[20:11.420 --> 20:24.120]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[20:24.120 --> 20:26.600]  We have a special report.
[20:26.600 --> 20:42.080]  up on prisonplanet.com right now that Paul Watson and I wrote this morning and it is
[20:42.080 --> 20:47.900]  absolutely essential that everyone go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and get
[20:47.900 --> 20:53.080]  this article. I'm going to be covering it coming up in the next segment. States need
[20:53.080 --> 21:00.560]  to launch criminal investigation into BP federal government's role in oil spill and I'm going
[21:00.560 --> 21:07.520]  to go over the key issues and bring some real clarity to this. I have been studying
[21:07.520 --> 21:17.120]  this for the last five plus weeks. I have been looking at it in great detail since this
[21:17.120 --> 21:33.720]  thing began and clearly, clearly this is a staged event and we're going to go over the
[21:33.720 --> 21:39.600]  reasons that we know it's staged but also why they staged it and call for state investigations
[21:39.600 --> 21:44.280]  because you're not going to have a federal investigation on this. But going back to internet
[21:44.280 --> 21:57.800]  censorship, China of course uses national blacklist to block web domains and key words
[21:57.800 --> 22:04.280]  at the internet service provider level. In the last year, Australia has passed laws in
[22:04.280 --> 22:10.480]  their own newspapers, they have the headline, more draconian than Chinese net censorship.
[22:10.480 --> 22:16.960]  That model has now been adopted in Italy, France is in the process of adopting it and
[22:16.960 --> 22:22.040]  England is moving towards adoption, Canada is moving towards adoption and now the United
[22:22.040 --> 22:27.640]  States is moving towards adoption but a level higher. The communist Chinese do not have
[22:27.640 --> 22:34.080]  a black box in your house that all of your internet has to be wired through. Whether
[22:34.080 --> 22:41.120]  your internet comes in off broadband or off of cable or off of a dial up or off of a T1
[22:41.120 --> 22:48.280]  or a DSL, it doesn't matter. Under federal regulations, this is what the FCC is announcing,
[22:48.280 --> 22:55.600]  not law but regulations and regulations are why a microwave has an FCC certification on
[22:55.600 --> 23:00.720]  it. Regulations are why a walkie talkie says FCC certified. All of that's approved. It's
[23:00.720 --> 23:07.320]  not a law, the FCC just says. Well, the FCC says that when Time Warner comes out to your
[23:07.320 --> 23:13.080]  house to install something or when dish network comes to install something or when anyone else
[23:13.080 --> 23:19.680]  comes to install internet at your house, Cox communications doesn't matter, it will be
[23:19.680 --> 23:25.560]  wired through and their equipment will be built to spec to only work being plugged in
[23:25.560 --> 23:32.240]  to their box and then everything in the government box will track and record what you do, where
[23:32.240 --> 23:37.000]  you serve, where you go, it's a wiretap in your house and they admit that, just total
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.200]  end of the 4th amendment, 5th amendment, 1st amendment, everything and it'll do more.
[23:43.200 --> 23:48.200]  This big brother telescreen won't just watch everything you're doing, it will decide what
[23:48.200 --> 23:56.160]  you can watch on your television slash computer console, everything's merged as you know.
[23:56.160 --> 24:00.440]  And the federal government says they're going to regulate what you can get access to. They
[24:00.440 --> 24:07.840]  say they're going to track what you see and what you do. This is 180 degrees in the opposite
[24:07.840 --> 24:21.880]  direction of liberty and freedom. This is in the opposite direction of our republic.
[24:21.880 --> 24:29.080]  And that really needs to sink in for everybody out there, it needs to sink in deep and you
[24:29.080 --> 24:33.560]  need to think about that because see a lot of yuppies I talk to say I don't care if we
[24:33.560 --> 24:37.360]  live under tyranny, why do I care? I don't care if they stop me at checkpoints, I don't
[24:37.360 --> 24:40.080]  care if they take my blood at a check point without a warrant, I don't care if they took
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.400]  my baby's blood for 38 years, going back to 38 years ago at birth, worldwide in every
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.080]  western nation for a UN secret program, now declassified, I don't care if they lied about
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.600]  the flu shot and told us that we had to have it and then it turns out the flu shot's dangerous,
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.080]  I don't care if sodium fluoride brain damages me, I don't care if the government takes my
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.280]  pension funds, I don't care if the government raises my taxes, I don't care, I mean is there
[25:03.280 --> 25:08.840]  anything you care about, do you have any self respect for yourself? Do you understand that
[25:08.840 --> 25:14.280]  with internet censorship, with surveillance, with black uniforms, with cameras, license
[25:14.280 --> 25:19.960]  plate reading and scanning your face, comes oppression, comes secret arrest and torture
[25:19.960 --> 25:25.320]  in every case in history, we know what's happening and the government's announcing oh we'll secretly
[25:25.320 --> 25:29.960]  arrest Americans and have them disappear into a black hole and be tortured with no court,
[25:29.960 --> 25:36.160]  no judge, no jury, oh we are going to set up labor camps, prisoners need to work, biggest
[25:36.160 --> 25:39.680]  prison population in the world, prisoners working, competing with your jobs, on the
[25:39.680 --> 25:48.280]  outside 25 cents an hour, we know what tyranny is, we know what bondage is, we know what
[25:48.280 --> 25:53.880]  oppression is and on every, if you had a checklist say of 20 things that mean you're
[25:53.880 --> 25:59.800]  a total tyranny, they've checked all 20, they've carried out many of the 20, they're trying
[25:59.800 --> 26:08.200]  to implement the other things on their list, I mean there's no doubt this is going on,
[26:08.200 --> 26:18.240]  it's 100%, government media control, censorship, out of control taxation, government that isn't
[26:18.240 --> 26:22.880]  accountable, government that's arrogant, government that does whatever it wants, this is when
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.480]  you have criminals that have taken over the society and they go hell, we've gotten away
[26:27.480 --> 26:31.800]  with committing thousands of other crimes, why not commit thousands more, why not get
[26:31.800 --> 26:37.480]  more bold, why not get more out of control, after all when the people finally physically
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.720]  rebel we've been planning for decades they say, if you read their own documents, they
[26:41.720 --> 26:46.560]  say we've been planning for decades to then call that sedition and bring in really hardcore
[26:46.560 --> 26:53.160]  oppression, this is going to work great, order out of chaos, I mean look at this, financial
[26:53.160 --> 26:59.480]  times of London, FCC and move to regulate internet, Napolitano internet monitoring
[26:59.480 --> 27:04.440]  needed to fight homegrown terrorism with an internet control box in your house watching
[27:04.440 --> 27:09.160]  everything you do, I mean just three years ago Bush was up there lying saying, I don't
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.080]  spy on you without a warrant, no Americans are being watched, then it came out they were
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.800]  listening to everybody non-terror related, listening to other members of the congress,
[27:17.800 --> 27:21.200]  in England they were spying on members of the parliament, a member of parliament released
[27:21.200 --> 27:26.480]  a secret document, the police came and arrested him last year for exposing that the British
[27:26.480 --> 27:31.640]  government was illegally spying on the parliament, see the parliament isn't really the government,
[27:31.640 --> 27:36.520]  the bureaucracies the government, the illegitimate government and how dare you an elected member
[27:36.520 --> 27:40.320]  of parliament report we're secretly spying on you, we're going to send a SWAT team to
[27:40.320 --> 27:46.400]  your house, you don't report on our crimes, you don't whistle blow as an elected member
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.400]  of the parliament, same thing now, oh you release a video of our troops killing kids and laughing
[27:52.400 --> 27:57.240]  about it, you're going to prison and it's in the Associated Press today and Der Spiegel
[27:57.240 --> 28:00.960]  that the American specialist that released that video of the troops killing the kids
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.880]  in Baghdad isn't going to be allowed to have lawyers and has disappeared into a black hole,
[28:06.880 --> 28:10.280]  that's the new America, you show our troops killing kids and laughing about it, you're
[28:10.280 --> 28:15.360]  going into a black hole, what would Hitler do if somebody released photos of Nazis killing
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.240]  kids, Hitler arrest that person, they'd be a traitor wouldn't they, see you live in Nazi
[28:20.240 --> 28:25.880]  Germany now ladies and gentlemen, this is the last days of free internet and people
[28:25.880 --> 28:30.280]  like Alex Jones on the radio because we are having an effect because people are listening,
[28:30.280 --> 28:38.640]  the system is scared, look at this free speech gag bill moving in house, donors of America,
[28:38.640 --> 28:45.440]  New York, this is CBS TV, New York wants teen texting ban in schools and home, it says even
[28:45.440 --> 28:49.600]  during the summer, the school wants to be able to download what's on your phone even
[28:49.600 --> 28:56.080]  inside your house, state court rules, it's okay for teachers to watch your kids at home
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.800]  without warrants on government issued laptops.
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.720]  The question is where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.520]  What have we got, a republic or a mocking, a republic is based on a constitution which
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.320]  protects minority rights, not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on
[29:16.320 --> 29:20.760]  what's for dinner, so they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children,
[29:20.760 --> 29:26.960]  our education, our money, we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate, somebody
[29:26.960 --> 29:32.960]  is going to ask you what you did during the patriot uprising, we have the facts, we have
[29:32.960 --> 29:37.400]  the constitution, we have the bill of rights, we have common law, knowledge is power, ladies
[29:37.400 --> 29:41.480]  and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you, don't tread on me, rise the
[29:41.480 --> 29:45.720]  republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American
[29:45.720 --> 29:52.160]  people is rising, a new tool in the info war, don't tread on me, order it at infowars.com

[30:09.640 --> 30:13.960]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[30:13.960 --> 30:15.280]  allows you to have.
[30:15.280 --> 30:20.980]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[30:20.980 --> 30:25.320]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:25.320 --> 30:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:29.320 --> 30:32.800]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[30:32.800 --> 30:36.520]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[30:36.520 --> 30:41.160]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[30:41.160 --> 30:45.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science,
[30:45.040 --> 30:46.440]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[30:46.440 --> 30:50.680]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[31:01.560 --> 31:06.080]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new 10 hour documentary and survival
[31:06.080 --> 31:08.000]  guide rolled into one.
[31:08.000 --> 31:11.720]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can

[31:56.840 --> 32:03.800]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[32:03.800 --> 32:08.160]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[32:08.160 --> 32:09.160]  do you want?
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.160]  My answer would be all I can get.
[32:11.160 --> 32:16.200]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[32:16.200 --> 32:17.440]  How much do you want?
[32:17.440 --> 32:18.440]  When do you want it?
[32:18.440 --> 32:20.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.600]  When will you need it?
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.040]  When you buy it without proper identification, will there be any food?
[32:25.040 --> 32:26.520]  Will it make your children sick?
[32:26.520 --> 32:30.640]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[32:30.640 --> 32:31.800]  and be immunized?
[32:31.800 --> 32:35.600]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[32:35.600 --> 32:39.200]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[32:39.200 --> 32:40.440]  How much will you need?
[32:40.440 --> 32:41.440]  We don't know.
[32:41.440 --> 32:42.440]  How much do you want?
[32:42.440 --> 32:43.440]  All you can get.
[32:43.440 --> 32:44.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[32:44.440 --> 32:47.640]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[32:47.640 --> 32:55.600]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[32:55.600 --> 33:01.920]  1-800-409-5633.
[33:01.920 --> 33:05.440]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[33:05.440 --> 33:10.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:10.960 --> 33:17.880]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[33:17.880 --> 33:25.240]  Some man you just can't reach, so you get what we had here last week, which is the way
[33:25.240 --> 33:26.240]  he wants.
[33:26.240 --> 33:27.240]  Well, he is.
[33:27.240 --> 33:40.520]  I don't like any more than you think.
[33:40.520 --> 33:48.280]  So just three years ago, it was a big deal to have the NSA spying on citizens without
[33:48.280 --> 33:49.280]  a warrant.
[33:49.280 --> 33:53.520]  And there was talk of criminal indictments, and the head of the CIA, the head of the
[33:53.520 --> 34:01.240]  NSA, Hayden, were in deep trouble, and would there be criminal charges of John Yu?
[34:01.240 --> 34:06.360]  And would there be criminal charges of Albertacon Zollis, who ordered torture?
[34:06.360 --> 34:11.800]  Three years later, Bush gives speeches on television and says, I ordered torture, and
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.800]  I'd do it again.
[34:12.800 --> 34:14.360]  Remember two weeks ago?
[34:14.360 --> 34:16.120]  And you can be all for torture.
[34:16.120 --> 34:19.480]  You can think it's a good American thing to do, and it's going to be, I guess, good when
[34:19.480 --> 34:21.320]  foreign governments torture our troops.
[34:21.320 --> 34:23.240]  No, we have double think.
[34:23.240 --> 34:27.560]  Our media, when our people get tortured, says it's wrong, but when we torture, it's good.
[34:27.560 --> 34:28.560]  Okay, whatever.
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.000]  You want to believe those confessions and believe the fairy tale's fine.
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.480]  The issue is they sent a lot of U.S. troops and contractors to prison who followed orders
[34:37.480 --> 34:38.480]  and tortured.
[34:38.480 --> 34:40.320]  So you've got to love that.
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.620]  Bush is publicly saying he ordered torture.
[34:42.620 --> 34:51.520]  We got all the White House memos ordering it, none of those guys get in trouble, but
[34:51.520 --> 34:55.200]  the people that follow the orders, they go to prison.
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.320]  That's how this new world order operates.
[34:58.320 --> 35:01.640]  And that is the nature of tyranny, one of the final stages of tyranny.
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.800]  And you know you've really hit rock bottom is when leaders publicly commit crimes and
[35:07.800 --> 35:09.080]  don't get in trouble.
[35:09.080 --> 35:13.200]  And then the book is thrown at their own underlings, though, for the same crime when they want
[35:13.200 --> 35:15.160]  to scapegoat someone.
[35:15.160 --> 35:21.800]  Okay, now I said that I was going to do a special report today on BP, and I am.
[35:21.800 --> 35:25.080]  It's just that I needed to spend the first 30 minutes of the broadcast on this Sunday
[35:25.080 --> 35:32.200]  edition, first explaining to people that you need to go read the new FCC proposals, and
[35:32.200 --> 35:33.840]  they say they're going to carry it out.
[35:33.840 --> 35:35.920]  They're going to implement it.
[35:35.920 --> 35:41.160]  They're going to, and it's the same way I got a smart meter at my office.
[35:41.160 --> 35:47.440]  Texas and the city of Austin in Texas and then all over the state of California in the
[35:47.440 --> 35:52.280]  last four years under a federal pilot program, they get federal money, have put smart meters
[35:52.280 --> 35:53.800]  in.
[35:53.800 --> 35:57.320]  And last year, my office, they came, put it on the side of the building, and the government
[35:57.320 --> 36:01.480]  controls the electricity flow in our air conditioners, and we have no choice.
[36:01.480 --> 36:05.640]  City of Austin says we're the one power supplier, we have a monopoly.
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.880]  And by the way, we're going to more than double the cost of your power and gas with the new
[36:09.880 --> 36:16.840]  carbon tax in the next three years, $2.6 billion, Austin Energy even announced it.
[36:16.840 --> 36:20.260]  Same thing in California, they just said, you know what, we're going to control your
[36:20.260 --> 36:25.600]  thermostat and under regulations, all new air conditioner compressors put in have to
[36:25.600 --> 36:30.560]  have a switch in them that's remote controlled by the new smart boxes.
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.840]  Not only do you have a smart box that controls the temperature in your house in many areas,
[36:34.840 --> 36:36.920]  not just Texas and California, it's spreading.
[36:36.920 --> 36:41.520]  Those are two of the more publicized cases.
[36:41.520 --> 36:48.720]  But now they've announced under federal regulations that within five years, your toaster, your
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.280]  refrigerator, your washer, your dryers, everything is going to be government tracked.
[36:54.280 --> 36:58.440]  This is openly being announced in the news.
[36:58.440 --> 37:06.760]  And here's Financial Times of London, Associated Press, Fox News, God Owners of America, CBS
[37:06.760 --> 37:07.760]  Television.
[37:07.760 --> 37:15.640]  But CBS Television says, oh, not only does the Department of Education want to ban sexually
[37:15.640 --> 37:20.080]  explicit text messages, and then you read what they actually want, it says here, and
[37:20.080 --> 37:25.720]  bullying, that students may do off hours or nights or weekends and summer vacations,
[37:25.720 --> 37:29.720]  but they also want to punish them for it, handing out to 90 day suspensions.
[37:29.720 --> 37:33.920]  And then you get jail time because of the suspension, because then they say you're truant
[37:33.920 --> 37:35.240]  even though the school kicks you out.
[37:35.240 --> 37:39.640]  And then it goes on to say that the phones will be accessible by the government.
[37:39.640 --> 37:41.520]  That's how they're going to know about this.
[37:41.520 --> 37:42.720]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.960]  The NRA's political sellout.
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.520]  Why is the gun rights lobby helping Chuck Schumer?
[37:52.520 --> 37:55.520]  Here's another one.
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.160]  I've got another article here dealing with Elena Kagan.
[38:00.160 --> 38:04.960]  Is Elena Kagan's emails?
[38:04.960 --> 38:11.160]  In Elena Kagan's emails, politics often trumps policy, and it goes into what a hardcore political
[38:11.160 --> 38:12.880]  operative she is.
[38:12.880 --> 38:21.040]  In fact, here's one of them, where she called members of the NRA, which is the White Wash
[38:21.040 --> 38:28.720]  Watered Down Second Amendment Group, founded to federalize gun control, the NRA lobbied
[38:28.720 --> 38:32.360]  for the 68 Gun Control Act, Charlton Heston, even though I've interviewed him and liked
[38:32.360 --> 38:35.280]  him, and a big fan, God rest his soul.
[38:35.280 --> 38:39.320]  I've got the video clips of Charlton Heston endorsing the 68 Gun Control Act that then
[38:39.320 --> 38:42.720]  led to the gun registration that you know of today.
[38:42.720 --> 38:45.880]  The NRA is a anti-gun organization.
[38:45.880 --> 38:46.880]  Okay?
[38:46.880 --> 38:50.600]  I just read you the Wall Street Journal admitting it.
[38:50.600 --> 38:58.760]  Working with Chuck Schumer to ban free speech in elections for pro-second amendment.
[38:58.760 --> 39:01.480]  But let me just continue here.
[39:01.480 --> 39:06.440]  This is out of the national review, and it's her quotes out of her paper, 1996, where she
[39:06.440 --> 39:10.120]  said that the NRA is the KKK.
[39:10.120 --> 39:14.640]  Well, yeah, I've got her Harvard writings where she said there's no second amendment,
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.800]  just like the Attorney General has said, and I've got her quotes about how we can restrict
[39:18.800 --> 39:20.520]  free speech whenever we want.
[39:20.520 --> 39:21.520]  Well, of course.
[39:21.520 --> 39:27.680]  I mean, this woman is only qualified to be Supreme Court justice because she hates freedom
[39:27.680 --> 39:29.000]  and hates America.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.240]  She's not qualified.
[39:30.240 --> 39:31.240]  She's not a patriot.
[39:31.240 --> 39:32.960]  She's not a constitutionalist.
[39:32.960 --> 39:34.840]  She's the polar opposite of that.
[39:34.840 --> 39:39.400]  Look, I can think of nothing more important than our free speech, ladies and gentlemen,
[39:39.400 --> 39:40.400]  your free speech.
[39:40.400 --> 39:44.280]  I have articles here in my stack where in Canada, people are being arrested and facing
[39:44.280 --> 39:50.400]  five years in prison for saying there's too many immigrants in Canada bankrupting the
[39:50.400 --> 39:52.280]  welfare system.
[39:52.280 --> 39:58.800]  We are inches away in the U.S. from not being able to have any free speech as Americans
[39:58.800 --> 40:03.600]  as the globalists bring in their client-state operatives who will vote to take your private
[40:03.600 --> 40:06.080]  property, who will vote to take your guns.
[40:06.080 --> 40:07.680]  Did you see the illegal aliens?
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.800]  The videos are up on PrismPlanet.com and Infowars.com, I play Clips of a Friday.
[40:11.800 --> 40:15.760]  This is what the police released and on the LA Times website.
[40:15.760 --> 40:22.480]  Hundreds of illegal aliens with their MS-13 Mexican mafia tattoos, waving giant Mexican
[40:22.480 --> 40:29.080]  flags and overturning cars, burning cars, attacking people, and the police did absolutely
[40:29.080 --> 40:30.080]  nothing.
[40:30.080 --> 40:35.040]  Now, the video is powerful, but if you look at the LA Times photos, it's one of Hispanic
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.880]  family in a car as the illegal aliens began attacking them.
[40:38.880 --> 40:40.920]  I mean, this is the insanity.
[40:40.920 --> 40:46.520]  Can you imagine if a tea party was out there attacking people waving Gadsden flags or the
[40:46.520 --> 40:52.080]  13 colony flags, you know, the 13-star flag?
[40:52.080 --> 41:01.520]  Can you imagine if people flying the Continental Congress flag were out there burning cars,
[41:01.520 --> 41:08.440]  overturning cars, attacking police, now it's been confirmed racially attacking anglows
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.160]  and cars, it would be the end of the world.
[41:12.160 --> 41:17.680]  But no, but no, nowhere in the media do they mention this until you actually watch the
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.360]  videos and read the footnotes because that's politically incorrect, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.360]  And in fact, you won't believe me, let me just actually find the article that was the
[41:26.360 --> 41:32.680]  Canadian national news because I was looking forward here in my stack where the man faces
[41:32.680 --> 41:41.640]  two counts of two to five years in prison and a giant fine in Canada.
[41:41.640 --> 41:42.640]  Where is it?
[41:42.640 --> 41:45.040]  I had it right here.
[41:45.040 --> 41:47.360]  You got to love this one out of the Washington Post.
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.840]  This system that elected New York Hispanic could expand, it says that the people get
[41:52.840 --> 41:58.920]  six votes apiece to vote in Hispanic leaders, so no longer one vote, one man, one man, one
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.920]  vote.
[41:59.920 --> 42:04.600]  And it said that it was considered that one vote per person was racist, so the illegal
[42:04.600 --> 42:06.560]  aliens are given six votes apiece.
[42:06.560 --> 42:09.960]  That's the Washington Post with a straight face reporting it like it's normal.
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.200]  Guys, it's up on infowars.com.
[42:13.200 --> 42:21.040]  This man arrested for hate speech against immigrants in Canada.
[42:21.040 --> 42:26.560]  I want to be able to actually read that so you hear it from the actual newspaper so you
[42:26.560 --> 42:29.080]  understand what's coming to America.
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.560]  And whether you agree with the speech of someone criticizing open borders or not, the issue
[42:34.560 --> 42:35.960]  is don't you support it.
[42:35.960 --> 42:41.480]  Okay, I promise, when we come back, I'm done talking about how they are overturning free
[42:41.480 --> 42:47.280]  speech worldwide and it's now coming to America because the criminal operations that have seized
[42:47.280 --> 42:51.360]  the government and are using it for their own personal cash machine know that we're
[42:51.360 --> 42:56.160]  awake to their criminal operations so they've got to silence us and really bring in more
[42:56.160 --> 42:58.760]  tyranny or they're going to all end up going to prison.
[42:58.760 --> 43:02.680]  You understand they're at the point of return.
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.680]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[43:06.680 --> 43:11.520]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.520]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[43:15.520 --> 43:19.720]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[43:19.720 --> 43:25.400]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[43:25.400 --> 43:32.280]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued
[43:32.280 --> 43:35.720]  legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.320]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.600]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[43:46.600 --> 43:52.560]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.160]  Silver Lungs Generator.
[43:54.160 --> 44:00.680]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[44:00.680 --> 44:04.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered
[44:04.280 --> 44:06.000]  generator.
[44:06.000 --> 44:09.600]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[44:09.600 --> 44:14.640]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to
[44:14.640 --> 44:15.640]  have.
[44:15.640 --> 44:16.640]  It's true.
[44:16.640 --> 44:21.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[44:21.640 --> 44:25.280]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[44:29.880 --> 44:32.760]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.360]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.200]  Number five, a solar powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[44:41.200 --> 44:45.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.400]  one of my old sponsors.
[44:46.400 --> 44:50.640]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[44:50.640 --> 44:52.360]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[45:00.440 --> 45:04.720]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[45:04.720 --> 45:09.040]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family
[45:09.040 --> 45:11.040]  owned and operated American company.
[45:11.040 --> 45:15.840]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[45:15.840 --> 45:18.480]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.480]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[45:22.480 --> 45:23.480]  anywhere.

[45:30.400 --> 45:31.400]  or infowars.com.
[45:31.400 --> 45:35.840]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[45:35.840 --> 45:42.840]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[45:42.840 --> 45:46.800]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[45:46.800 --> 45:57.360]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website, five-starsoap.com, for buying a one to two
[45:57.360 --> 45:58.360]  month soap sampler.
[45:58.360 --> 45:59.360]  Thank you.
[45:59.360 --> 46:04.360]  You may be arrested, and are subject to other police action.
[46:04.360 --> 46:05.640]  Tyranny is here.
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.520]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[46:09.520 --> 46:11.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[46:11.960 --> 46:16.520]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[46:16.520 --> 46:17.760]  on earth.
[46:17.760 --> 46:22.560]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[46:22.560 --> 46:24.400]  expanded nationwide.
[46:24.400 --> 46:28.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[46:28.440 --> 46:30.440]  old powerful shadow state.
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.520]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[46:34.520 --> 46:38.960]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[46:38.960 --> 46:44.080]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[46:44.080 --> 46:45.080]  corner.
[46:45.080 --> 46:48.280]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[46:48.280 --> 46:50.320]  The police state isn't coming.
[46:50.320 --> 46:51.320]  It's here.

[47:02.040 --> 47:05.560]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[47:05.560 --> 47:34.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[47:34.560 --> 47:54.760]  You tell them, Axel, we are back live.
[47:54.760 --> 47:57.560]  Look at the top of news I have here.
[47:57.560 --> 48:03.360]  Obama gives major swathe of Arizona back to Mexico.
[48:03.360 --> 48:06.880]  I mean this is incredible, and every week I see where Mexican troops come across and
[48:06.880 --> 48:10.720]  shoot at US police and military, and our troops have been ordered.
[48:10.720 --> 48:12.880]  They can't be armed or have bullets in their firearms.
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.240]  Meanwhile, I've been to military drills around the country where regular army comes out with
[48:17.240 --> 48:20.480]  loaded guns, and it's actually in my film in game.
[48:20.480 --> 48:26.280]  I have troops wearing 45s on their side in New York, run over and cuss at me and tell
[48:26.280 --> 48:27.760]  me not to videotape them.
[48:27.760 --> 48:32.080]  And of course, I got in their face and said, I'm American, I'm red-blooded, it's the First
[48:32.080 --> 48:33.080]  Amendment.
[48:33.080 --> 48:35.000]  I'm a face traitor.
[48:35.000 --> 48:41.400]  They backed off because they're so used to people bowing down to thuggism and tyranny
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.760]  that they didn't know what to do, and their officer ran across the street and got them.
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.880]  And I didn't care, let those troops 45 me right in the head.
[48:49.880 --> 48:52.760]  If that's what it takes to defend the First Amendment, how are you going to look troops
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.560]  when you shoot an American in the head because you want to come over and get in their face?
[48:57.560 --> 49:01.640]  Some gangbanger with a gun in a US army uniform.
[49:01.640 --> 49:05.040]  That's what America has turned into, folks.
[49:05.040 --> 49:06.400]  That's what America has turned into.
[49:06.400 --> 49:12.760]  You look at the people burning cars and attacking people in Los Angeles, they're now the police,
[49:12.760 --> 49:16.680]  they're now the military, and they're coming for the property, they're coming for the guns,
[49:16.680 --> 49:17.680]  they're coming for everything.
[49:17.680 --> 49:19.320]  I want to be clear about that.
[49:19.320 --> 49:21.160]  And let me explain something, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:21.160 --> 49:30.480]  You see hooligans in England acting just like the illegal alien gangs in Los Angeles.
[49:30.480 --> 49:38.600]  So it's not a racial issue, it is dehumanized, dumbed down, brainwashed TV heads that have
[49:38.600 --> 49:44.400]  just been turned into morons that have been given power.
[49:44.400 --> 49:46.800]  In fact, let me just get to this now, then I'm going to get into the BP.
[49:46.800 --> 49:50.160]  The BP is our top story, I'm going to spend a lot of time on it and then take your calls.
[49:50.160 --> 49:54.000]  But I want to build the foundation of all this info first.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.560]  Lakers Violence Authorities Release Raw Video of Mob Attacking Cab Seek Public's Help.
[50:00.560 --> 50:04.440]  And the LA Times goes on with the raw video to admit they attacked a bunch of other vehicles
[50:04.440 --> 50:09.160]  of people in it, set fire to trash cans, set the taxi on fire to pulling the people out.
[50:09.160 --> 50:13.480]  I mean, you watch this video, it's like five minutes long, it's actually six minutes long,
[50:13.480 --> 50:14.960]  and it is scary.
[50:14.960 --> 50:21.760]  The gang signs, the Mexican flags, the laughing, the burning the car, the dragging people out
[50:21.760 --> 50:24.120]  of their cars on some of the other videos that are out there.
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.920]  I mean, it is, it is scary, folks.
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.120]  It is scary.
[50:29.120 --> 50:36.920]  Lakers Violence Authorities Release Raw Video of Mob Attacking Cab Seek Public's Help.
[50:36.920 --> 50:39.120]  You can fast forward to the end when they set it on fire.
[50:39.120 --> 50:44.200]  We can't play the audio, but PrismPlanet.tv viewers can watch this or just go to PrismPlanet.com.
[50:44.200 --> 50:49.080]  You can watch it, I guess, until the government censors the internet.
[50:49.080 --> 50:50.480]  But there it is.
[50:50.480 --> 50:54.040]  See, they don't like the open free internet because it shows misbehavior, misbehavior
[50:54.040 --> 50:58.640]  by police, misbehavior by throngs, velial aliens, waving Mexican flags.
[50:58.640 --> 51:03.320]  In fact, there's another angle from wider of this scene where it shows the Mexican flags,
[51:03.320 --> 51:07.080]  big giant ones, people running around, because we can't play the audio because of all the
[51:07.080 --> 51:09.600]  cussing, but we can at least show that image.
[51:09.600 --> 51:14.800]  Show the video from Friday with the Mexican flags, that's important.
[51:14.800 --> 51:21.400]  But continuing here, what if Tea Party's Waving Gadsden Flags had trashed L.A.?
[51:21.400 --> 51:26.760]  That's an important article by Paul Joseph Watson at GCNLive.com.
[51:26.760 --> 51:31.720]  Bread and Serkers has gone awry, mindless sports fans, riot in L.A.
[51:31.720 --> 51:32.720]  What do you see in England?
[51:32.720 --> 51:34.360]  What do you see in South Africa?
[51:34.360 --> 51:40.640]  Rioting, people stabbing each other, people stampeding each other to get into the games.
[51:40.640 --> 51:46.600]  You see people at Walmart because they're going to have a sale, stampede and kill a
[51:46.600 --> 51:52.560]  bunch of people over mindless crud made in China, crud made in China that destroyed our
[51:52.560 --> 51:57.200]  industrial capacity and any future to have jobs in this country.
[51:57.200 --> 52:00.640]  What have we been turned into collectively?
[52:00.640 --> 52:02.920]  As humans, we've been dehumanized.
[52:02.920 --> 52:10.080]  We've been turned into people that only value sports, that only value sports teams and Hollywood
[52:10.080 --> 52:15.800]  stars and fluff and the latest celebrity gossip.
[52:15.800 --> 52:20.320]  And while you're busy focused on that, the federal government is openly moving to take
[52:20.320 --> 52:25.640]  your free speech and openly moving to set up a North American Union and destroy our
[52:25.640 --> 52:28.800]  Republic.
[52:28.800 --> 52:35.120]  And I can think of no better illustration of that than this.
[52:35.120 --> 52:42.040]  I heard this on XM Fox News yesterday, so I went and looked it up.
[52:42.040 --> 52:50.760]  And sure enough, you can even watch video online of LeBron James basically wasn't even
[52:50.760 --> 52:58.640]  going to show up to this fan appreciation event in the city where he lives because he's reportedly
[52:58.640 --> 53:04.240]  going to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and go to another team.
[53:04.240 --> 53:13.200]  And so it's reported that several thousand people, one press report says 2001 says 4,000.
[53:13.200 --> 53:25.440]  This article says 4,000 attended and it says that LeBron James showed up 10 minutes before
[53:25.440 --> 53:26.440]  the event was over.
[53:26.440 --> 53:30.040]  It was a two hour event from 11 to 1.
[53:30.040 --> 53:33.720]  He showed up sometime past 1240 when most people had already left.
[53:33.720 --> 53:39.520]  There was a stampede with some injuries with people wanting to get in to see their God.
[53:39.520 --> 53:41.000]  They don't want private property.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.200]  They don't want a bill of rights.
[53:42.200 --> 53:43.320]  They don't want a constitution.
[53:43.320 --> 53:44.320]  They don't want dignity.
[53:44.320 --> 53:45.920]  They don't want their second amendment.
[53:45.920 --> 53:48.600]  They don't want to be able to raise their children as they see fit.
[53:48.600 --> 53:49.600]  They don't want that.
[53:49.600 --> 53:55.560]  They want bondage between 2,000 and 4,000 people show up and sit there like schmucks
[53:55.560 --> 54:00.520]  for almost two hours waiting for their sports God and reportedly he got called by the team
[54:00.520 --> 54:03.320]  managers and told you better get down here to this.
[54:03.320 --> 54:10.280]  You knew this was coming up and the slobs gave this slob a trophy and he left.
[54:10.280 --> 54:15.920]  Now the point is, could you get 3 or 4,000 people to the city council of Cleveland to
[54:15.920 --> 54:21.800]  stop tyranny or stop the fact that the city's openly going bankrupt and is extremely corrupt?
[54:21.800 --> 54:26.680]  Could you get 3,000 Austinites down to the city hall to stop 2.6 billion in taxes over
[54:26.680 --> 54:31.520]  the next three years on our power and gas, a total carbon tax ripoff that the UN openly
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.200]  got passed locally because they couldn't get Congress to do it?
[54:34.200 --> 54:35.720]  They said, well, we got some idiots in Austin.
[54:35.720 --> 54:36.720]  Let's rob them.
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.200]  Could you get 3,000 or 4,000 Austinites there for that?
[54:40.200 --> 54:45.280]  Could you get 3,000 people to call the FCC or to write letters to the FCC or to call
[54:45.280 --> 54:50.320]  radio stations and tell them to fight back or to call ISPs and tell them to fight back
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.120]  against government censorship and surveillance of the Internet?
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.840]  Could you get 3,000 people out to stand up against water fluoridation, which admittedly
[54:58.840 --> 55:01.560]  causes brain damage and bone cancer?
[55:01.560 --> 55:02.560]  No.
[55:02.560 --> 55:10.480]  Could you get 3,000 people out in Cleveland against year number 9 coming up in Afghanistan
[55:10.480 --> 55:15.920]  going into year number 7 in Iraq coming up?
[55:15.920 --> 55:18.520]  No, you couldn't.
[55:18.520 --> 55:21.040]  And that's why the globalists are making their move on us.
[55:21.040 --> 55:22.560]  They know we're a joke.
[55:22.560 --> 55:25.720]  I talk to adults who are even well-to-do in business.
[55:25.720 --> 55:26.720]  They don't know history.
[55:26.720 --> 55:27.720]  They don't know anything.
[55:27.720 --> 55:29.320]  But they know all about sports teams.
[55:29.320 --> 55:31.760]  I talk to professors.
[55:31.760 --> 55:32.960]  They're done in the box of rocks.
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.760]  I talk to all these pseudo-intellectuals, and they know nothing about the world.
[55:38.760 --> 55:41.520]  And everybody's wearing their UT Longhorns hats.
[55:41.520 --> 55:44.000]  And that's all anybody talks about in the town where I live.
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.000]  Not about freedom, not about liberty, but a fake tribal.
[55:51.000 --> 56:00.280]  What was the word that the late, great author called it, grand faloon?
[56:00.280 --> 56:03.200]  It's something that really doesn't even mean anything, but a bunch of people that have
[56:03.200 --> 56:09.800]  no connection to it rally around it and worship it and laud it, Kurt Vonnegut.
[56:09.800 --> 56:16.440]  Incidentally, Kurt Vonnegut, just a cultural point, was a fan of the show and sent me a
[56:16.440 --> 56:17.440]  hand-done print.
[56:17.440 --> 56:19.440]  He did about a year before he died.
[56:19.440 --> 56:21.800]  Never get him on the show, though.
[56:21.800 --> 56:26.640]  He said that his time was over, and he was making no more public appearances, and I guess
[56:26.640 --> 56:28.840]  he stuck with it.
[56:28.840 --> 56:34.920]  But you love all these grand faloons, things that don't matter, while all of your freedom
[56:34.920 --> 56:35.920]  is being robbed.
[56:35.920 --> 56:41.440]  We've got a great graphic up on infowars.com on the front page that shows a bunch of guys
[56:41.440 --> 56:45.080]  sitting on their couch with beer and potato chips, looking at a television set that has
[56:45.080 --> 56:46.840]  the world cup on.
[56:46.840 --> 56:53.200]  And behind them's a giant picture window, and it's Obama on a bulldozer bulldozing
[56:53.200 --> 56:58.640]  the bill of rights and constitution and our healthcare.
[56:58.640 --> 57:04.640]  But imagine these people, LeBron James thinks the people that pay millions of dollars a
[57:04.640 --> 57:08.880]  year, a bunch of schmucks, and they are a bunch of mindless idiots.
[57:08.880 --> 57:10.280]  He could care less about them.
[57:10.280 --> 57:13.720]  He could care less about them some appreciation event.
[57:13.720 --> 57:19.040]  Imagine almost 4,000 people, the press reports, showing up to beg and lick the boots of someone
[57:19.040 --> 57:21.320]  saying, please don't leave our town.
[57:21.320 --> 57:26.360]  We associate our well-being and our identity with you, a person that runs around the court
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.000]  bouncing a ball and putting it in a hoop.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.480]  We don't have any identity of our own.
[57:31.480 --> 57:32.480]  Don't leave Cleveland.
[57:32.480 --> 57:37.080]  Oh please, and they begged and cried, and parents taught their kids that this is your
[57:37.080 --> 57:44.200]  idol, not a inventor, not a trailblazer, not an explorer, not a patriot, but some guy bouncing
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.480]  a basketball.
[57:45.480 --> 57:46.480]  That's why we're slaves.
[57:46.480 --> 57:52.160]  BP analysis coming up.
[57:52.160 --> 57:56.680]  The fall of America and the western world is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival
[57:56.680 --> 57:58.600]  guide rolled into one.
[57:58.600 --> 58:02.720]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can
[58:02.720 --> 58:03.720]  do to prepare.
[58:03.720 --> 58:09.040]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farrah, David Ike, Naomi Wolfe, G. Edward

[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:40.160]  Close to 4,000 people attend a fan appreciation of LeBron James.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.920]  Football riot when their team loses or wins.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:51.000]  I've got reports here out of the BBC, football hooligans must surrender passports.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.120]  Now, notice police state laws about mobility.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.120]  Imagine Nazi Germany.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:59.280]  They said, you must come register with the police if you're going to travel outside your
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.640]  town because you're a Jew in 1935.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.880]  By 1940, they were getting shot in the back of the head.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:11.240]  Well, now it's, oh, you got caught in a fist fight once, for the rest of your life, you're
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]  on probation.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.080]  Or, oh, you sent a bullying text that's joked to your friend and said, hey, dummy, I'll
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.440]  see you after school.
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.160]  That's considered a crime, and the school downloads what's on your phone now, even when
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:32.880]  you're outside school in New York, so you're all under their control.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:39.960]  We are just totally surveilled, totally domesticated, and the BBC reports, football hooligans must
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.400]  surrender passports.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.600]  So anybody who's ever gotten in a fight, anybody who's ever gotten an argument, anybody who's
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.680]  ever been arrested, drunk in England, gets put in a crime database, which, oh, I saw
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.760]  an article last year, they're now using the hooligan database for other criminals.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:01.360]  Oh, and then they said, not just people that have committed crimes, but people that are
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.040]  at risk of committing crimes or who have said things that are politically incorrect, bordering
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.640]  on thought crime, bordering on hate crime.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.800]  They actually have thought crime now in Canada and England and Europe, and now they're teaching
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:18.960]  our kids this here, now they're implementing it here, now they're calling for it here.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.080]  Oh, you want to go to South Africa, sorry, you must surrender your passport, you're not
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:31.080]  allowed to go anywhere in the world because you got in trouble once at a soccer match.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.840]  Even football hooligans must surrender their passports to stop them traveling from the
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:41.200]  World Cup in South Africa.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:45.360]  Individuals in England and Wales with football banning orders must hand over their documents
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:51.120]  at police stations by 2200, this is a few weeks old, now what happened?
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.720]  They didn't turn in their passports, so there were SWAT team raids.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:00.800]  That's right, in England, their crime rate has more than tripled since they totally banned
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.560]  guns 15 years ago, go look at the numbers.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:08.160]  You can't get a cop to show up for serious crimes, people have been robbed over and over
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.480]  again if they defend themselves, they get arrested.
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.560]  Now that's happening in Chicago and New York, it's a crime to defend yourself and when you
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.840]  need help, the cops won't come.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:25.120]  But all over the country, they had huge police task forces to go out and arrest people that
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.720]  didn't turn in their passports ahead of the World Cup.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:33.600]  See how there's endless resources for stunts like this.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.480]  Police promise more arrest and crackdown leading up to the World Cup and see now there'll be
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.800]  travel bans.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.360]  If you have other crimes, oh sorry, 10 years ago you got in a fist fight at a bar, well
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:50.960]  I was attacked by him, I've already paid my fine and done my weekend jail, sorry you're
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:56.120]  never allowed to leave England and we're raising the taxes to 95%, France is already
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.600]  over 80, we're going to 95.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.080]  We're actually discussing that.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.720]  Five convicted English soccer hooligans have been arrested in early morning raids as part
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.280]  of a crackdown ahead of the World Cup.
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.880]  Police say the men are between ages 20 and 44 of age and were detained at their homes
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.560]  in Central England.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.720]  See a stunt, so everybody here is, I'm sick of those hooligans ruining a good match.
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:26.800]  Good, ban them from traveling, make them turn their passports in, their right to travel.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.080]  It's only for soccer though, until now they're announcing it for everything.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:41.400]  Alright, South Africa on hooligan watch, ahead of England match, AP, oh my gosh, okay, but
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:47.040]  again that's all that matters, the new religion, LeBron James, oh please don't leave, he barely
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.440]  even shows up at the event, he's like, ah shut up scum, look at these smucks paying money
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.200]  for me to run around putting a ball in a hoop, look at these little slaves, they don't care
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.640]  they lose all their freedom, they don't have their own identities, haha.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.200]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions, if you're going into a battle and
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.920]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:14.520]  My answer would be all I can get, in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:19.040]  Food is your only ammunition, how much do you want, when do you want it, now or after
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.480]  the battle starts, when will you need it, can you buy it without proper identification,
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.560]  will there be any food, will it make your children sick, if there's a quarantine and
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.920]  you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized, you wipe
[01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.840]  out all these problems if you have a good food supply, food is your ammunition to fight
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:42.160]  for your freedom and your life, how much will you need, we don't know, how much do you want,
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.720]  all you can get, I'm Alex Jones, I want all of you good guys to live to fight another
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:55.400]  day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:24.400]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.880]  I've also got some other news dealing with the economy and we will have some time to
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:33.720]  take your calls, but we are now well into the second and final hour, I do four hours
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.400]  weekdays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time, but of course we come back on Sundays
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:46.240]  four to six p.m. because wild horses couldn't drag me away from standing up for this republic.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.000]  I don't know, the FCC openly saying they're going to ban free speech and take over the
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.640]  internet and put special taxes or bans on quote conspiracy theories and they list man-made
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.360]  global warming not being real as one of them, the White House does, I better do seven days
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.160]  a week or I better just filibuster up to the last minute, they turn us off, I mean you
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.240]  think I'm joking, I just read from the FCC, a government control box in your house, I'm
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.400]  going to give you the phone number for the bottom of the hour, but I specifically want
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.320]  to hear from callers on two issues, BP and the information I'm about to cover and if
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.680]  you tuned in during the last hour or have been paying attention to even mainstream
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.520]  news is all reporting, oh hey the government's going to put a box in your house to decide
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:35.520]  what internet and TV you can watch, that's no big deal, you know the world cups on, basketball
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:43.080]  is on right now, baseball too, hey did you hear about that new hip hop album that came
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:48.720]  out, yeah, so I want to talk about the attack on free speech that's going on that I can't
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.880]  even believe, it's one thing to see all these White House Zars proposed it, but it's nothing
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:08:00.240]  to actually see it about to pass in legislation and via regulations, so I just can't get over
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.840]  how huge this is, here's the toll free number to join us if you want to get into the queue,
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:15.280]  Treble 82012244, Treble 82012244, 8882012244 or local folks listening to news radio 590
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:39.040]  KLBJ 5126461776, okay, let me get my stack here and get focused, and now ladies and gentlemen
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:49.080]  for my analysis of the British petroleum oil spill, that is now entering its third month,
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:54.040]  we have the White House and the BP executives when they're not out at yacht racing events
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.720]  or when Obama is not at a baseball or basketball game or having a gala party, they're saying
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:05.120]  it now may last until Christmas or perhaps for several years and then only 2% of the
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:11.000]  oil they estimate has been released and BP and the White House say that there is at least
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:21.160]  2 billion gallons, 2 billion with a B gallons left or 98% more to come out of the hole.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.560]  Many experts are on record saying that if they slant drill and detonate a hydrogen bomb
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.160]  that because the fissures have already broken through and there's oil plumes up to 20 miles
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:34.480]  away coming out of the ocean floor, that this will probably just shatter things further
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:39.960]  and could release a mega massive oil spill, dwarfing the one we now see and that there's
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.800]  always people keep calling it a talk radio and saying, you know, is there natural gas
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.320]  down there? Is there methane? Could there be a giant explosion? Well, of course there's
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:54.280]  natural gas in any of these super deep wells, they hit it in four, five, six, seven or more
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.720]  layers as they go down. And yes, we know there are giant gas domes in the gulf. And yes,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.160]  using a nuke will probably detonate a lot of those different underground gas domes that
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.540]  are in those different strata and will cause an even bigger crisis, which is great for
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.240]  the government. They'll just nationalize oil companies that much faster and slap a
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.120]  big carbon tax on you. But, but all of that doesn't matter. Everybody's obsessing over
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:26.200]  the BPCO stepping down because he got caught out racing yachts or Obama talking about nationalizing
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:34.280]  the oil companies or his carbon taxes. All of that is important. But it is dwarfed in
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:42.040]  comparison to our top story today. And let's go back to November. It had just broken in
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:48.440]  the German and British news in two newspapers. I'd seen it a few days before going around
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.400]  on the internet. It took that much time for the media to pick it up. It turned out the
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:11:00.040]  BPC had been given it six months before in full the climate gate emails where you've
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.720]  got the top three universities in Europe, England and the U.S. all colluding with each
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.160]  other to lie and say that the oceans were going to rise and the ice caps were going
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:14.600]  to melt and the carbon dioxide was the cause. And it was them premeditatedly admitting they
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:19.240]  were lying, hiding the decline, manipulating temperature data that they were getting from
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.520]  around the world from governments. They were just changing the numbers. They've been caught.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:32.160]  And I got up here on air and I said, this is a chance to snatch victory out of the jaws
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:38.680]  of defeat. Copenhagen was guaranteed to pass global taxes paid to the IMF and World Bank
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:44.440]  on all fossil fuel use and all carbon footprints, including what Bill Gates has even announced
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.640]  in the U.N.'s announced taxes on your exhaling because that is carbon dioxide. All animals
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.680]  exhale carbon dioxide, plants respirate and have their photosynthesis from the carbon
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.440]  dioxide we exhale. They release oxygen part of the carbon cycle. But they had convinced
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.280]  people this was deadly poison. It was kind of their inside little joke. And so they had
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.440]  sold everyone on this and I got up on air and I said, you're going to hear about this
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.240]  in the next few weeks. And people for a week or so ask if the emails were a hoax. And if
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:20.240]  I was even making it up. Okay. So the rest is history. You now know what happened with
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.880]  that. And we were instrumental along with the drudge report with driving that story
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.040]  out in the United States into the mainstream media. It took us three weeks until that was
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.680]  finally in the mainstream news in the U.S. There was a news blackout everywhere in the
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:40.480]  U.S. but drudge report dot com and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com. Okay. There
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.120]  was a news blockade and we wrote articles about that and said call talk radio. It took
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.080]  limbaugh two weeks to cover it. It took savage a week to cover it. It took Hannity two weeks
[01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:56.520]  to cover it. And I'm not saying those guys are bad. The point is, you know, drudge and
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:02.000]  I, we were first in the U.S. But drudge second, we come in drudge. Drudge now linked us twice
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.520]  again last week, three times before that. And it's incredible. The amount of may but
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:14.000]  side issue. The point is we were able to drive that out into the open together. We were able
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:19.720]  to break that media blockade and cut through the lies and we can do that together right
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:25.600]  now here today. Paul Watson gave up his Saturday and his Sunday to write this article in consultation
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.040]  with myself and to transcribe what you're about to hear. Now, I won't have time to read
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:36.840]  the entire eight page article, but I'll assure you this is as important as LeBron James,
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:42.000]  James, uh, fan appreciation worship session where he's the new pope and people go into
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.880]  an auditorium and bow down to him and he barely shows up. You know, if, if, if, if, if we could
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:53.960]  get 4,000 Americans in every big city, that'd be millions put together. If we could get
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.920]  people as concerned about what's about to happen. Most people are watching this golf
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.240]  spill like it's a spectator sport and in, in getting into the whining and complaining
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:09.040]  and why won't they fix it and something needs to be done and arrest BP. Don't worry, BP's
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.600]  going to laugh last. And they're definitely part of this unless people wake up and take
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:21.360]  action on this issue. Now here is the headline and this is up on info wars.com and prison
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.760]  planet.com right now. It is a plan of action, a plan of victory. If you will simply take
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.120]  action, this is such a huge issue. So start your engines and fall warriors. It's got the
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.280]  phone numbers on it and I'm going to add the number to Rick Perry and I'm going to also
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.520]  add the number to Alabama and then the, the East coast states, but the most important
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:46.440]  are Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida right now. Their phone numbers and email are there.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:51.400]  So get ready folks. You want to do something instead of just sitting there, uh, and sucking
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.840]  your thumbs. You want to have an effect and I'm talking to people that again went to LeBron
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.280]  James appreciation and he didn't even really show up for the event. I'm talking to those
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.200]  folks who were sucking their thumbs. I know my listeners are not thumb suckers. The point
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.200]  is if you want to actually do something, you call other talk show host, you call newspapers,
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.400]  you tell them, get on this story, you send this to other websites, you tell them, get
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.000]  on it now, get on it now and look at this information you're about to hear because this
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.240]  is as big as climate gate. This is a house of cards ready to fall. This is a dangerous
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:38.560]  gamut. This is a deadly dangerous, um, strategic move. Roll the dice by the new world order
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:45.520]  and we have a very good chance of torpedoing them to the bottom of the ocean figuratively
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:51.080]  to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. They have miscalculated if you take the bull by
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:55.720]  the horns, if you take action. So when we come back and for this quick break, I'm breaking
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:02.480]  it down. States need to launch criminal investigation into BP. This is Alex Jones with five good
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:07.520]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:12.040]  could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:17.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.040]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:26.840]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.560]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.000]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.920]  onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.600]  of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:51.000]  Science, one of my old sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:05.720]  you. They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:11.440]  order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.160]  through their own words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:21.480]  a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control. The United Nations
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:27.800]  would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.880]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.160]  world government. I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.400]  constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the establishment of
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.440]  the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news

[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:05.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:10.320]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:15.280]  all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:20.740]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:25.320]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.360]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:33.640]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.840]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.640]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:52.000]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:12.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:41.920]  Okay, my friends, we are back live. Again, thank you for joining us. States need to
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:49.200]  launch criminal investigation into BP, federal government's role in oil spill. You heard
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:54.560]  me right. I have read the Coast Guard's hearings interviewing the people that were on board,
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:21:00.000]  the emergency ships, and the oil rig that survived, including the head of the drilling
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:07.200]  rig operation, the head of the operation for Halliburton as well. You've all heard the
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.800]  endless trivia in the news, but kind of hidden in the back that, oh, yes, the people on the
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.440]  rig, they knew months before. First, it was weeks before, then a month before. Now, it's
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:24.240]  two months before that BP executives from Houston, there were arguments on the ship
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.240]  over the satellite phone in front of the employees saying no one's ever dumped salt
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:33.040]  water in on top of one of these instead of cement and mud. This is going to blow up.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:40.720]  So, we know they gave them an order that would cause it to blow up. We know they then block
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:47.600]  the states for the last 60-something days now from people being able to go out with the oil
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:53.520]  booms and block the estuaries so the oil couldn't go up in the rivers and streams and salt marshes
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.160]  where most of the fish go to lay their eggs and where the manatees live and where the dolphins
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:05.200]  cav. And so all of that's going on, but let me just go over the article itself because it hits
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:12.400]  every point and puts on the case that needs to be criminally investigated. Clearly, BP gave the
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:15.920]  order knowing this was going to happen, but it may be even worse. They may have just blown it
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:20.960]  because they're the top globalist company pushing for the global carbon tax.
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:26.480]  They've been the big oil company trying to get the other oil companies nationalized
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:32.400]  to get rid of their competition. States need to launch criminal investigation into BP,
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:39.520]  federal government's role in oil spill. There can now be no doubt whatsoever that BP oil spill
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:45.360]  was purposefully contrived either through deliberate negligence or outright sabotage
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  and is now being used to further the Obama administration's political agenda.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.000]  Criminal investigations into the government and BP's role in the disaster need to be
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:00.480]  launched by state authorities in Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi immediately. That's
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:10.480]  immediately, ladies and gentlemen, there can no longer be any doubt.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:16.720]  Criminal investigations into the government and BP's role in the disaster need to be launched
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.640]  by the state authorities in Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi immediately while local authorities,
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.760]  public servants also need to call emergency legislative sessions in order to take over
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:32.880]  emergency response efforts from the feds before the crisis gets much worse. Absolutely,
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.920]  Obama wants to play golf the last two days and go to parties and the head of BP wants to go sail
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:44.720]  around on yachts. They're laughing at you. Six plus weeks ago, he dispatches some Nobel laureate
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:50.160]  down there, some egghead. Oh, here's a Harvard lawyer. He'll fix it. Oh yeah, the same Harvard
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:55.280]  lawyers that fill up Goldman Sachs ripping us off for trillions. The same ones that create
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:58.400]  derivatives and steal all the pension funds. You mean those geniuses?
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:08.720]  While BP CEO Tony Hayward is busy watching yachting races, Barack Obama, who took two
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:13.440]  vacations immediately after the oil spill, spends his time between playing golf and going to the
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:19.440]  movies. If the disaster is on a par with 9-11 as Obama claims, then why is he fiddling while
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:24.800]  Rome burns? Every effort to find a solution to the crisis while cleaning up the mess has
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:30.000]  been lackluster and half-hearted. The federal government's hyped rhetoric about how bad the
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.680]  consequences of the spill has been has not been matched with the appropriate action
[01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:40.800]  to combat the problem. In hindsight, it's becoming clear that the government has deliberately botched
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.560]  the response and prevented local authorities from doing their jobs just as FEMA deliberately
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.600]  sabotaged the state response to Hurricane Katrina. Yeah, what happened three days ago?
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:57.040]  20 more state skimmers sent out there by Gendle in Louisiana and the Coast Guard showed up and
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:02.960]  said, no, that's been going on for 50-plus days of the spill since a week or so in.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.720]  In order to make the crisis much worse and create the pretext for a police state response,
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:13.840]  gun confiscation, and ultimately more federal power, and then we link to all the things that
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:22.560]  are happening right now that this oil spill is distracting from. Numerous reports have surfaced
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:28.800]  of local and state authorities being prevented by BP contractors in U.S. Coast Guard from helping.
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.800]  To address the devastation, the spill has created in the region. Governor Bobby Gendle has ordered
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.880]  the state's fleet of 16, now they're reporting 20, vacuum barges to clean up the oil in Louisiana
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.080]  marshes on Wednesday. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted the barges and ordered them to stop the cleanup.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.840]  Obstensively, the Coast Guard wanted to inspect the barges, but that didn't expect them. Then
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:26:00.800]  they wanted to inspect the history of the barges, just like unions will go in and block a construction
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:07.280]  just by sitting around on their hands and doing nothing. The federal government shows us the
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:13.520]  slaves whose boss, nothing happens without their say so, not until Obama's passed that carbon tax
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.560]  on everything you do and a new dark age of tyranny's brought in, a new age of feudalism to control
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:23.120]  your every movement, not until then will they fix that oil leak, and not a minute later,
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:31.760]  and not a minute earlier. It just ordered them back to the dock and then did nothing.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:39.600]  Justice happened with Katrina, BP, an alliance with the feds, have erected an information
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:44.480]  blockade around the spill. Reporters have been harassed, threatened with arrest, and prevented.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.600]  From accessing the affected areas, oil spill cleanup workers have been gagged from talking
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:53.600]  about their experiences. They're not allowed to wear respirators because they'd have to admit
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:58.640]  that the oil was off-gassing toxic chemicals. Foreign ships have been prevented from helping
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.680]  in the cleanup efforts. Every effort has been made to stop the truth about the oil spill from
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.400]  being uncovered. Almost everything we learn about the situation comes directly from BP
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.840]  or the federal government. The strictly enforced cover-up shows the authorities are more concerned
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:18.800]  about protecting the information lockdown than actually cleaning up the spill. Exactly. The way
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.240]  the whole system is set up is to keep the spill going and to contain news coverage of what's
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.960]  happening. And then Obama comes out and says, I've got to have a carbon tax. I've got to nationalize
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:35.600]  the oil companies. We've got to tax you. The Jones Act, which forbids foreign ships from
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:41.920]  operating between U.S. ports, can be waived, but hasn't been. Obama could have had the problem
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:47.760]  solved in a matter of weeks, but he immediately refused the help of 13 entities that had offered
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:53.600]  the U.S. help with the oil spill assistance within about two weeks of the horizon rig explosion.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.440]  And it just goes on and on. Every indication points to the oil spill having been deliberately
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.520]  caused either by negligence or sabotage by a combination of BP executives and those who hold
[01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:09.600]  the reins of power in the Obama administration. And again, BP is his third biggest contributor
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.920]  and is deep, deep in with Al Gore and the biggest funder of the carbon tax propaganda.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:23.680]  This goes beyond Obama himself, who's a merely eighth there to read the teleprompter and employ
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:29.040]  his fine acting skills in selling his agenda that the globalists hope to enforce on the back
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:34.400]  of the contrived crisis. On May 27th, the New York Times reported on how just days before the
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:41.440]  explosion BP chose to use a salt water solution to seal the cement around the casing pipe,
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.200]  which was known to be a far riskier option than the stronger, heavy drilling fluid.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:51.440]  This is after the weld was already cracked and leaking, we now discover. Folks,
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.160]  it goes into all the evidence, how they had the motive to do it, why they did it,
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.720]  how they're continuing to cover up. Stay with us.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.000]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.920]  What have we got? A republic or a mocking? A republic is based on a constitution which
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.880]  protects minority rights, not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:20.960]  for dinner. So they think they own our land, they think they're on our water, children,
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:26.960]  our education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:31.920]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. You have been warned.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  We have the facts. We have the constitution. We have the Bill of Rights. We have common law.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.320]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.200]  Don't tread on me. Rise the republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.760]  that is the American people is rising. A new tool in the Info War. Don't tread on me.

[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:09.360]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:28.560]  You know, I understand citizens being angry by the CEO of BP being out Thursday, Friday,
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:37.600]  and Saturday at yacht races. I mean, I know this country's in trouble and I don't need to do six
[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:41.200]  radio shows a week. I don't need to do all the radio interviews I do. I don't need to do all
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:47.040]  the newspaper interviews I get. A lot of times I want to be home with my family. I want to be
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.360]  out fishing. I want to be out hiking. I want to be working out. I want to be oil painting. I want
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:58.240]  to be, you know, doing all the things that I enjoy, visiting with family, traveling. But no,
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:03.040]  I'm stuck here in Austin most of the time. I work seven days a week. I do radio six days a week
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.480]  because I know our society is in trouble. But why is the public mad at the BP
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.600]  CEO for out yachting? America is sinking. States are going bankrupt. Our industrial
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:19.760]  capacity is gone. We're about to lose our AAA rating. We're about to have to devalue the
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:24.960]  currency even further. We're in a world of hurt. Every economic indicator and societal indicator
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:30.640]  shows we're in a depression and it's going to get steadily worse. And you got almost 4,000 people
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:37.600]  showing up at a LeBron James fan appreciation meeting to worship him and to beg him to not
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:45.280]  leave Cleveland and the Cavaliers. And then he shows up 10 minutes before the end and was basically
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.080]  rude to people because he thinks you're a bunch of jokes, a bunch of schmucks because you are.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.640]  Your priorities are screwed up. America. America is sinking. America is leaking.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.360]  America is burning and falling apart just like the Gulf of Mexico. And you don't care. Just
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:09.120]  like the BP CEO because everybody's a bunch of selfish people who aren't serious and aren't focused
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:14.080]  and aren't angry about liberty and freedom who aren't serious, who aren't willing to fight for it
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:26.400]  or speak up for it. You're in action. You're in action. We'll buy you chains and slavery. Understand
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.880]  that. All right. I'm done talking about that. Let me just boil down the facts instead of going
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:34.400]  over this detailed article Paul Watson wrote because at the end of the article, it's a long
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:38.720]  article. At the end of the article, it gives the phone numbers out. And if you read the entire
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.600]  article and you need to, folks, if it was about LeBron James, I'm sure some of you would,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:50.560]  this is about your future. You would understand the evidence of it being a staged event,
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:58.640]  any way you slice it, the BP disaster 100% and their motive, what they're getting out of it,
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:03.280]  what the agenda is. But let me just briefly break that down. Then I'm going to your phone
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:09.280]  calls for the balance of the transmission. BP's a top globalist environmental company
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.120]  that literally wrote the book in the last 20 years owned by Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands
[01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:20.720]  in co-ownership with Queen Elizabeth of England, Saxe, Coburg, Gotham, Elizabeth, Saxe, Coburg,
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:28.720]  Gotham of Windsor, the German Queen and the Dutch Queen and their globalist. They openly BP
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:34.000]  is always pushing for the carbon tax key supporters of Obama. They want the new feudal system.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:40.240]  They have always pushed for the US to nationalize oil companies, but privatize the profit to them.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:46.240]  BP already is so powerful, they get 80% of the oil out of Alaska. The government gives it to them
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:55.200]  and it is then shipped to Asia. Only 20% goes to the US. BP is the sole licensure on
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:01.280]  really over 80% and then of the 80% they get, 80% of that goes to Asia. I mean, that's how things
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:08.160]  are done. It's all rigged. Go check it out for yourself. Go research who gets the oil in Alaska.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:15.840]  So, all of that's going on and they don't want their competition in the Gulf. They were given
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:21.520]  an award. They were given special waivers for the super deep well six months before Obama
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.840]  took the restrictions off the entire Gulf, but he never really took the restrictions off.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.320]  He only loosened them, allowed BP's competition to move in. Then the oil spill starts. All that
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.400]  competition's been barred after they already brought their rigs in from around the world,
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:43.200]  costing tens of millions of dollars conservatively just to bring those giant factory systems in,
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.720]  like a floating space station or something, and now they're in deep trouble.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:54.640]  And so, you've got all that happening. This is a strategic sabotage. Now,
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.560]  I mean, BP is going to put an escrow of 20 billion. That's like when you win the lottery and they put
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:04.800]  money into a lottery for you and then they pay it out over 30 years. It's a pittance compared
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:09.280]  to their real profits. They'll just change their name, make a subsidiary. They're already talking
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:15.120]  about that and then get more power and control over the oil companies and over their competition
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:20.560]  by doing it. But more importantly, Obama, as I told you 60 days ago, in fact, what day of the
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:26.160]  oil spill are we into? You looked that up. I heard it a couple of days ago, but I forget. The point is
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:32.720]  70th day. I mean, holy mackerel, it was 60 something just a few days ago. Time flies.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:39.840]  So, we know they have the motive. Now, I mean, I told you just a week into it, I said Obama is
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:44.960]  going to push for the carbon tax and he's going to push for gas taxes and oil taxes on the well
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:52.400]  end at the gas pump and on all energy and on natural gas, effectively nationalizing petroleum.
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:39:00.080]  And now he's come out last week and proposed that and they admit it. So all of that is happening.
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:05.440]  But then you go back over the evidence of them staging it. You have BP dumping
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.680]  the BP executive dumping over a third of his stock the week before this happens. You have
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:18.960]  Goldman Sachs that co-chaired BP. Goldman Sachs really has a controlling share in BP. You said,
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:23.840]  well, I thought you said it's the queen. They have the controlling shares in Goldman Sachs
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.960]  and in BP and in Dutch Royal Shell. I mean, in everything, go do your research.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:35.520]  But Goldman Sachs chairman, in fact, that's the Bloomberg headline. Goldman Sachs CEO
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:44.000]  and chairman, he was both was Goldman Sachs head. People won't believe it and they won't
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.440]  look it up either. Just pull it up and people will be able to see it at prismplanet.tv.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.160]  And so they dumped their stock. Goldman Sachs dumps its stock record level,
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:58.320]  not on any other oil company, just that one. The CEO dumps his stock. Halliburton,
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:02.880]  doing work for them a month before, we now know two months before they knew this was going to
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:10.240]  blow up, Halliburton goes out and buys a company that does gulf cleanups for oil and it goes on
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:18.800]  and on and on and on and on. But that's all just circumstantial. Concrete on record, we have
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:26.240]  a month into this and we're now 70 days in. A month in, they had the Coast Guard hearings
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.120]  with the men that were on the ships and on the rigs and who were in the conversations and they
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:35.280]  said it's never before been done. You can go read these transcripts. We have links to it
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:39.680]  in our article at prismplanet.com. States need to launch criminal investigation to BP,
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:44.640]  federal government role, and oil spill. And we go through the evidence. And they were told,
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.160]  you're not going to put concrete in, you're not going to put mud in, you're going to dump water
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.600]  in to the well. And they said that won't pressurize this well. A regular well would blow out. A
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.320]  regular well would come in, as they call it. And it's going to explode. The rig is going to burn.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:03.520]  And there it is. Goldman's great timing for unloading BP stock. Yeah, yeah, that's the
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:09.040]  article about him unloading it. The headline out of Bloomberg was Goldman Sachs' head was also
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:14.400]  head of BP. But it was in a bunch of papers, but we've got to show them they're programmed
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:18.560]  not to believe anything. Okay, they're programmed. And if something's threatening to them,
[01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:26.320]  they deny it. I must show them. Okay, so all of that's going on, all of that's happening. And
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.680]  you can read, I can't say this on the radio because it's cuss words, but you can read the
[01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:38.000]  transcripts of the hearings. And it's the head of the well, the head engineers, the people who were
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.200]  the head engineers on the boats, all talking to BP in the two months before saying, this is going
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:48.080]  to blow up. This is going to catch fire. And then when it blew up, there's all the conversations in
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:55.280]  the court record, two BP executives in Houston from the satellite phones saying, you bleeping
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:02.160]  bleeper, I told you this was going to come in and it was going to cause an explosion in a fire.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:10.080]  Are you bleeping happy? No one has ever dumped water in on a deep well. You understand, folks,
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.400]  to keep the gas and oil pressure down, they're supposed to put in mud and cement and block it
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:21.040]  in and put multiple plugs in. Instead, they dump seawater in. And the people told them it's going
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.760]  to blow up. Now, shouldn't there be a criminal investigation? Isn't that at least criminal
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:31.440]  negligence? As our article says, evidence 100% criminal negligence. But all the evidence points
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.040]  said deliberate criminal negligence. Now, I'm going to give each caller one minute or less
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:42.560]  when we come back. So be ready. And when we come back, I'm going to give you the phone numbers to
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:47.360]  the governors. You can't count on the feds to do this. They're the ones running the whole operation
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:52.080]  and using this to nationalize and pass new taxes and takeover society. They've already taken over
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.720]  health care. They've already taken over the banks. They've already taken over the automakers for
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:02.080]  insiders. Now they're going to take over energy, folks. Stay with us. This is Alex Jones with
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:06.960]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:11.840]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.640]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three,
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.880]  in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.000]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.720]  local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:41.600]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.200]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:51.120]  one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:11.760]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality. It really says that the state
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:16.720]  is God. The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.720]  states on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.840]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:32.960]  program has established an old powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.320]  depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:44.480]  dictatorship. Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:49.680]  street corner. It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan. The police state
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:57.040]  isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest

[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.600]  going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:14.880]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.240]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.640]  starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.520]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.000]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:39.120]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.880]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:52.800]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out

[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.560]  The fall of America and the western world is an all new 10 hour documentary and survival guide
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.120]  rolled into one. In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing

[01:46:47.360 --> 01:47:02.240]  or call 800-655-1577. Prepare yourself and the ones you love today, fallofamerica.net.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:24.800]  Look, I'll be discussing this more tomorrow on my weekday show from 11 to 3 central at infowars.com
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.560]  and prisonplanet.com if you don't have a local AM and FM station in your area.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.000]  But I can give each caller about 45 seconds because we've got about 10 phone calls on the
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.040]  phone board here and I want to go to Paul, Maggie, Julie, Mike, others just have your point ready,
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.280]  make it and we're going to move on because I want to hear what you have to say but I got,
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:52.320]  I ran out of time covering the news. Bottom line, BP and the White House are inside baseball team
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:48:00.400]  members. Goldman Sachs quietly owns BP. They are behind the banking collapse, not just here but
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:07.120]  in other nations. They need their carbon tax which is to be paid to the private central banks, namely
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.400]  JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others. They need their world government. They need their
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:17.760]  new global currency, SDRs, backed up with carbon taxes. Their whole agenda is in trouble
[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:25.120]  since the Copenhagen-Denmark Treaty fell apart and now Obama's got a chance with this ongoing
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.560]  crises for the people to say something must be done and he says, guess what? I got a tax for you.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.200]  That'll fix it in the future and that's what they've done. That's why he's playing golf and laughing
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:41.920]  at you and the BP guys out there sailing around. It's a big joke. So you need to go to infowars.com
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:47.280]  and prisonplanet.com to this article titled, States Need to Launch Criminal Investigation to BP.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.760]  What are the states doing when the feds tell them you can't be off the shore 100 yards with your
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:59.680]  own state vessels cleaning up oil? Since when do the feds rule everything? It's time for the states
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:05.200]  to say no, but it's also time for the states to have their own indictments, their own grand jury
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:12.320]  investigations of BP. They need to call in these BP employees, stop letting BP boss everybody around
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:17.600]  and tell the media they can't be there on the seashore, stop letting the BP run the cover-up for
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:23.520]  Obama. They're all working together and bring these people to justice, folks. They have created
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:29.120]  this crisis and they're bringing in the tyranny of the nationalization of the oil companies and
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.800]  that means energy increases. The oil companies are nationalized in Europe. They pay $7, $8 a gallon
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.120]  for gas, folks. Don't say you weren't warned. Here are the phone numbers. I'm going to blitz
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:45.440]  to your calls quickly. Here are the phone numbers. Again, they're in the article. You can call the
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:59.440]  governor of Florida, Charlie Christ at 850-488-441. Again, that's Governor Charlie Christ. That's
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:10.080]  850-488-4441. You can call Bobby Jendal, who's big on talk, short on action, all hat and no cattle,
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:16.320]  inch deep mile wide, fake conservative. Give him a call. Come on. Let's see criminal investigation
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:21.600]  by the state. The state's got criminal prosecution powers. Grab those BP people and clap them in
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:33.520]  irons. Come on. Get those witnesses in there. Mainline 225-342-7015. 225-342-7015. Again,
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:39.440]  these numbers are all up on the site. Call Hailey Barber, the former head of the RNC. You think
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:45.840]  he's going to save you. You better look out, folks, but call him and let that overfed joker know
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:55.920]  that we're fully aware this is a bipartisan scam being run. 877-405-0733. 877-405-0733.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:59.840]  Stop playing games. They're emails. They're addresses. Other numbers. They're all up on
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:07.120]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com. Stop screwing around. We know that BP executives gave orders
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:11.360]  that were criminal, that they knew would blow that well up. They were told that in the Coast Guard
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:16.960]  testimony. It's on record. We have them get a criminal investigation going like Enron and they'll
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:22.240]  start ratting each other out and we can bring them and Barberi Sotaro, known as Barack Obama,
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:27.120]  and all the rest of these criminals down. Or you can have them win and nationalize oil and
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.840]  carbon tax you and literally have federal inspectors in your house. That's in the bill. It's already
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.800]  passed the house. This isn't a game. They're coming with internet boxes in your house that run your
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.360]  TV through it where the government watches everything you do. I've got the FCC's own
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:47.200]  documents here. This is happening. You're being raped. All right. What's the point
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.600]  of even taking calls? Maybe I should go into overdrive, huh? Maybe that's what the guys want.
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:54.720]  You guys want to do some overdrive here to make sure we get to all these calls?
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:00.560]  I don't see an excited urge. Come on. Let's do it. We'll do what we have to to at least take
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.720]  these calls. We won't be on the AM and FM, but we'll be at the internet streams at least at
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:09.120]  infowars.com. Let's go to Paul in Connecticut. Paul, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.040]  Great. Look at that. 9-11 brought us Patriots 1 and 2. In the wake of this BP disaster,
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.040]  they're going to rush through a lot of anti-constitutional stuff. But come on. The governors
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.640]  are just as corrupt. The state legislatures are just as corrupt, and you're never going to get
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:26.320]  a grand jury to do anything because they've got guys in there that are just not going to do what
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.360]  we want. Oh, yeah. They're all going to get paid off, and they're going to whine and act like
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:33.600]  they're mad. Well, you've got to do something. You can have county grand juries that have people
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.640]  that were damaged by the oil. They can start calling in these BP workers who were out there
[01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:42.720]  on record saying they were ordered to do stuff they knew would blow up. I mean, we can't just
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:46.960]  give up, Paul. What do we do? Oh, no, I'm not giving up. I'm telling you, it's going to come to push,
[01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:51.280]  come to shove. It's got to get worse. The people aren't going to wake up. These basketball fans
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:55.440]  are running over cars, and the rest of it, they're on a whole other level. That's what's important
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:59.440]  to them. That's right. They don't want freedom. They want to go out and attack families and cars.
[01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:04.640]  Look, you've got the borders that are open up. They've got the UN, and they've got foreign troops
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:09.680]  on the soil. Obama just gave a national part to Mexico. I mean, you can't make this up.
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:13.600]  FEMA camps are sitting here waiting for us while we're sitting here sucking our thumbs,
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:17.280]  waiting for the whole thing to come down. Paul, I hear you, Maggie. Maggie in Pennsylvania,
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:25.360]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, I just wanted to call. I saw a brasscheck.tv video.
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:32.640]  These are professors that are talking about a huge deadly bubble of gas underneath this thing.
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:39.920]  If they're right, this thing hasn't even begun to destroy what it's going to do to
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:48.720]  not Louisiana or Mississippi. It's going to be a tsunami on Florida. If this...
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:53.200]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, I appreciate your call, but we don't have any evidence that
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:54:01.840]  it's going to blow up and detonate a bunch of natural gas. Again, that's a rumor that that's
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:07.920]  going to happen. If they detonate a nuke, though, it could ignite those underground gas supplies
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:12.240]  and could cause a chain reaction. So I do think it's serious. We should look at it,
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.760]  but a lot of people are saying this is guaranteed to happen. A lot of fear out there.
[01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:19.760]  I've done an investigation. That's not the case. Julie in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:25.920]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, I love your show, and I just wanted to say a couple days ago,
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:31.200]  because of the urgency of the propaganda on the Iran thing and now all of a sudden,
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.040]  this Armada going to the Persian Gulf. But a couple days ago, knowing that these people are
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:41.520]  occultists and numerologists and sun worshipers, I just... I mean, I know a little bit about
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:47.280]  astrology, the total eclipse on July 11th, which is in both the sun and moon of cancer,
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:53.120]  which is the water crisis. And it's supposed to happen... Well, I don't believe in astrology,
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:55:00.080]  but I had a politician, a well-known politician come to my office off record and tell me that this
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:04.880]  big astrological thing, this is about three months ago, was going to happen in July, and there'd be
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:10.720]  all these disasters and America was done. And I had this well-known person come to my office to
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:19.600]  tell me this off record, and... Julie, I appreciate your call. It's all insane. Volcanoes going off,
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:25.440]  oil spills, the economy falling apart. And yes, U.S.-Israel warships in Suez may be prelude to
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:32.240]  face off. That's the Israeli national news. Armada of U.S. and Israeli warships head for Iran,
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:38.960]  Kurt Nemo, infowars.com. Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:48.240]  That's from the national news of Iran. Press TV. Yes, Israel says they may nuke them. They're
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.400]  preparing. They're getting ready basically for World War III. Meanwhile, we're all talking about
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:59.360]  the Gulf. Good point. Mike and Texas, you're on the air. Hey, Alex. How's it going? Good. Well,
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:05.120]  I was in Austin about a week ago, and I was down at the Capitol, and they had like four or five
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:09.520]  people outside to investigate BP. Half of these people don't even know what they're talking about.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.960]  Never mind. We could go out and teach them how to... But LeBron James was going to leave a team,
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:21.760]  the Cavaliers. He got 4,000 idiots there, so he can come disdain them and look down on the stupid
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:29.600]  slaves. Well, yeah. Well, here's a good point. That's a great point, but here's another call
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.800]  out to people, because we all know this is a big disaster. This is nothing. This is
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.000]  a small... Well, sir, the disaster is going to be the carbon taxes, Mike. Absolutely. Well,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:46.880]  the disaster is that it's a set up, staged event, any way you slice it, to take over America,
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.600]  to seize another area of the economy. So we're all under government control, and so the offshore
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:56.560]  banks that run our government can rob us like we're Nigeria or Argentina. This has been done
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.880]  over and over again by these people. We know how they do it, Mike. I hear you. We got to get the
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:06.560]  word out. God bless you. Look, I'm out of time for the main radio broadcast, and I get so frustrated
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:12.160]  only having two hours. I get frustrated having four hours, but if you're a radio listener,
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.160]  I'm only going to do about 10 minutes on the other side. You'll have to go to infowords.com.
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:20.800]  It'll be internet only to listen to the free audio streams at infowords.com. We'll take some more
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.400]  calls and recap this and get into the Iran situation, and then it'll go into retransmission.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:31.120]  Or you can also watch us right now at prisonplanet.tv if you want to catch the rest of the show.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:35.680]  For everybody else, I'll be back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. with the Sunday edition,
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.240]  4 to 6 p.m. Central, and back tomorrow, of course, 11 a.m. Central, 12 noon Eastern,
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:44.320]  with a four hour big kahuna. We got some really big informative guests coming up this week.
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:48.160]  God bless you all. Great job to the crew. Stay with us. We'll be back in one minute.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:55.360]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[01:58:48.480 --> 01:58:56.800]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new world order based
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:02.400]  upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:08.240]  words and documents. The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:13.520]  It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take over America.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:19.280]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:24.320]  and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.880]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.360]  financial system. Global governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:39.360]  inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:46.160]  Empire. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch it online in the

[01:59:48.720 --> 02:00:15.280]  All right, my friends, I'm going to cut to the chase in this abbreviated overdrive.
[02:00:15.280 --> 02:00:19.200]  Thank you for joining us. I want to be able to talk to Lance, Bori, Rob and Ronnie,
[02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:24.960]  and then we'll cut off this transmission. And to explain to listeners what overdrive is,
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.760]  as some get confused, you have the regularly programmed radio, four hours, weekdays,
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:34.000]  two hours on Sundays that are on AM and FM and go out on the satellites and are heard on AM and
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  FM stations. I can go over and just be on the internet streams and the prisonplanet.tv. But
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:46.640]  then that won't be in the rebroadcast. It'll only be archived in the podcast and in the video podcast
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.040]  archive at prisonplanet.tv. Okay, we're going to these callers here in a moment because I'm
[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:58.640]  committed to take your calls. Look, the challenge is out there. We know BP staged this. Either they
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.640]  deliberately blew it up or they gave orders knowing it was going to blow up that much is
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:10.160]  totally proven. They stood stand again, the carbon tax insider control, they're owned by Goldman Sachs,
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.360]  big financials of Obama, the big banks must have their carbon tax. They blocked the relief efforts.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:20.880]  The list goes on and on and a lot of people not just me now are coming out saying staged event,
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.880]  but Paul Watson and I in one spot codified all the evidence. And I'm going to be making a YouTube
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:31.440]  video that's going to be very simple as soon as this shows over that really boils it all down
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.680]  succinctly in about five minutes. That's going to go up on the Alex Jones channel tonight
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:41.120]  with this article and links to the phone numbers to call the governors and the legislatures and to
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:46.240]  have them call for criminal investigation. We've got to shift this from just letting BP in the
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:51.200]  White House federalize and corporatize and control everything. We've got to shift this
[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:58.080]  into the people calling for criminal investigations and put the issue of criminal activity on the
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:03.200]  plate because people are talking about violent revolution and liberals are calling for 100,000
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:08.560]  man marches to the sea and all this sedition. We don't want that. The globalists would use
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.400]  that for control. We want to peacefully use the court system to go out for these crooks.
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.720]  And again, I want to just say great job to you, the activist listeners, look what we did with
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:23.120]  Climategate with the Mac report with 9 11 with so many other big issues. We can get this out
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:27.120]  there and force it in the mainstream media if you take action. And I want to commend my entire crew
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:32.320]  and organization. We could not do what we do here without them. And I'm so glad that I've got a team
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:37.040]  here at my office that realizes just how historical the work is we're doing. And I've
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:42.720]  got people that work with me on my team who are more excited about Liberty and freedom and fighting
[02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:47.520]  tyranny than they are about LeBron James and the World Cup. And I know all of you out there
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.400]  watching are the same and we are brethren. We are together in the spirit of Liberty and
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:58.240]  freedom. And God bless you. You are Earth's best and only hope. I salute you. All right.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:05.680]  Let's take four calls. Then I'm going back to retransmission where I broke down the incredible
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:11.760]  attacks on free speech at the first of this transmission. Lance in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:19.520]  Alex, thank you for waking me up. I pray for you every day. This thing is getting so crazy with BP.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:26.160]  What's going to happen when we force the mainstream media to pop out the methane gas
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:32.320]  and the hydrogen sulfide that's out there? And I mean, are they going to do a law and
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.480]  want evacuations and put people on cruise ships? Or what should you take, Alex?
[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:41.360]  Well, clearly, all of that is a distinct possibility. They are covering up how deadly the
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:46.000]  gas is. People are getting sick. They're not letting BP workers wear respirators. If they
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:50.880]  set a nuke off, most of the experts say it will detonate a bunch of gas, make it many times worse,
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:55.760]  which will be great. Then Obama will say the answer is more taxes. I got to go. I got to go.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:00.480]  I don't know. I got to go play basketball. I got to go watch a baseball game. I got to go have,
[02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:06.560]  you know, rock stars play for me every night at the Winehouse. Order out of chaos. Again,
[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:13.360]  he won't do anything to stop the leak. He's doing everything he can to pass these draconian
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.720]  straightjacket laws that outlaw normal human activity so the government can take control
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:22.960]  of our lives, Lance. This is the beginning of more and more stage crises. I've been saying,
[02:04:22.960 --> 02:04:27.600]  Obama, what stage of major false flag? They're gearing up for an attack on Iran,
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:31.760]  but who would have ever thought an oil spill false flag? But the evidence is clear. This is
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:39.040]  a false flag. Thank you, Lance. Lori in Arkansas, go ahead. Hi, Alex. Thank you for everything
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:50.640]  you're doing. My take on this is that I have been writing my senators, my local news station with
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:58.880]  the story since like the 8th of June. No one will get back with me on any of this. They're not
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:04.400]  answering. They're not, they're not responding. We need to keep this going. The story needs to
[02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:10.160]  stay out there. I've been on, me and my husband both. We've been on the internet, emailing,
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:15.200]  blogging, trying to get the story out. They are shutting it out. We're getting
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.600]  denial of service attacks when we try to post things. They are scared. Everyone needs to keep
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:26.240]  this going. Well, BP, admittedly, has spent more than $50 million. That was a few weeks ago. It's
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.920]  growing. On manipulating the web, controlling the search engines, going after people, not letting
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:36.800]  their employees wear respirators because the other slaves may see it and know it's dangerous.
[02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.840]  Yes, this is serious. The first couple of weeks, I was like, okay, oil leak happens all the time.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:47.200]  As I learned more and more, and I saw their response, my worst fears were confirmed. They are
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:54.240]  absolutely, they are absolutely going for broke. They just brought me a note in. Okay,
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:59.600]  okay, we'll go to 1530. That's fine. That matches with the music. We're trying to match
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:04.000]  when we're going to break so that it connects into the next segment in the rebroadcast.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:11.120]  Throws us for a loop when I do these overdrive broadcasts because you'll notice there's no
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:18.720]  commercials. It's just wide open. Radio stations are programmed for commercials. Then it becomes a
[02:06:18.720 --> 02:06:26.080]  conspiracy theory that won't wire into commercials or side issue. Let's talk to Rob in Texas. Rob,
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:32.480]  you're on the air. How are you doing, Alex? Worldwide broadcast. Sir, welcome.
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:40.320]  Okay. Real quick, the Funkmaster 5 channel has been working hard. We got our latest call up on
[02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:46.000]  our channel. It is a call into Dennis Miller's show, Plugging Invisible Empire, four times before he
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:52.480]  was able to try to do anything about it. That is incredible. You are awesome. You are awesome,
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:57.600]  my friend. And the power of individuals calling into talk radio, promoting films, websites,
[02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:03.440]  news articles, Funkmaster 5. I need your help and everybody's help calling talk radio and saying
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:12.080]  criminal investigations. But notice the neocons are taking the part of BP did no wrong and Obama
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:20.560]  is trying to come in and take them over. And the fake left is acting like Obama isn't doing enough
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:26.880]  and being tough enough on BP when BP and Obama work for the same people, Goldman Sachs. And this
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:32.960]  is about a control crisis to bring us the carbon tax. Well, we're going to keep calling in these
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:38.640]  shows on the real meat and potato issues. We need people to come on board and do these calls also.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:44.240]  Get on Funkmaster 5 channel on YouTube, favorite, subscribe, comment on our videos, get out there.
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.680]  All the numbers to all the major talk shows are on our main page. So you can get on there if you
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:52.800]  have Skype or whatever and start calling. I'm going to be calling about this spell for sure.
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:57.120]  Well done. Couldn't say it any better, my friend. Keep it up.
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:07.760]  Who's up next here on my list, guys? Ronnie in Texas here on the air.
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:13.200]  Thank you, sir. Though usually banned, I'm number nine at the Austin City Council meeting this
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:17.120]  Thursday and hopefully Tuesday at the Travis Kinnick Finish Assort meeting. But fighting for
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  freedom of speech, for peace, the ongoing no war on Iran movement just keeps blossoming here. And I
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:31.680]  carry a hand-painted no war on Iran sign on top of my combo. Ron Paul took Baldwin's sign wherever
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:36.800]  I go. And I've gotten lots of maybe hundreds of thumbs up waves, happy honks. Absolutely. The
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:41.200]  American people don't want war. They continue to put out fake polls saying half of Americans want
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.720]  to attack Iran. But the way they phrase the polls is, if Iran's about to hit us with a nuclear weapon,
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.360]  should we defend ourselves? Well, hell yeah. But see, that's not what's happening. So that's
[02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.480]  how the deception works. Ronnie, what do you think of the open announcements to start shutting down
[02:08:56.480 --> 02:09:02.000]  freedom of speech that are now not just being made by bureaucrats. It's now being promoted as
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:07.760]  legislation and as regulations. And what do you make of the BP situation and the evidence of this
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:12.880]  being a false flag terror attack? I agree with you. It is everything points to it being a false
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:19.120]  flag. And it's so horrifying. Kagan and everything else about dissolving our constitution entirely
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.800]  with this hogwash of the national security problem. That's an excuse to destroy our First
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.080]  Amendment. That is the key issue of everything. It's everything I try to talk about when I get
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.440]  in front of the city council or the Travis County Commission Court or wherever I go. I try to,
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.040]  you know, this is the key to everything. And if we lose the First Amendment, nothing else matters.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:45.760]  And so we need to keep that. I'm so proud of you. And thank you, sir, for everything you do.
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:53.280]  And if any way I can, I'm proudly a prison planet TV member now. And I need help on,
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:59.520]  uh, I can't say a little technical thing. I have trouble getting to make films. And is there a
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.760]  number to call for to be helped on that kind of thing? Well, sir, I can let people make copies
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.480]  of my films, but I can't afford to make the copies and give them away. I appreciate your call. I mean,
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:14.240]  I've done two hours and 10 minutes of radio today and never said buy my books, buy my videos
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:18.960]  that are all available at info wars.com. That's how we finance this. And people all the time call
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:23.360]  and say, give me free videos. I mean, folks, no one else that I know of, you know, says,
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.600]  please get my film, make copies. I mean, we've really trailblazed that. And that's as good as I
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:33.440]  can do. In fact, we need people's financial support ourselves. We need people to buy the books,
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  buy the videos, buy the t shirts. All of it is about getting the word out of you want to donate
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:42.960]  to us so we can expand and fight this tyranny p o box one nine five four nine, Austin, Texas,
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:48.320]  seven eight seven six zero. There's also a donate button down at the bottom of info wars.com or
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.520]  spread the word about the show that also supports us as well. I'll be back live tomorrow 11am central
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.320]  with more key info. Look for that YouTube report coming out tonight, breaking all this down. Great
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.960]  job with the crew. We now join my show from earlier today when we were live on the attack
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:12.480]  on free speech 11 and a half minutes into the four o'clock hour two hours ago. I'm Alex Jones
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:38.480]  signing off until tomorrow. God bless you all.
