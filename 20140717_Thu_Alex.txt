[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:27.520]  welcome to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'll be your host for this first
[00:27.520 --> 00:31.640]  hour Alex is going to be joining us in the second or third hour he will also be
[00:31.640 --> 00:36.880]  joining us in this hour with a special report about some breaking news he did
[00:36.880 --> 00:42.960]  a report with Joe Biggs last night about yet another US Army base that is
[00:42.960 --> 00:48.160]  training for civilian unrest but this one has a very troubling spin this one
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.880]  they're singling out just black Americans all of the people who are acting
[00:52.880 --> 00:57.600]  the role of the Disturbers are all black now you may not care about that
[00:57.600 --> 01:01.240]  because you're not black but you need to understand that when the government
[01:01.240 --> 01:05.840]  comes after one group that doesn't make you protected because you're in another
[01:05.840 --> 01:09.520]  group I've heard many people say you don't have to outrun the bear if you're
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.440]  in a crowd of people you just have to outrun the slowest person well the
[01:14.440 --> 01:18.800]  problem with that is that that bear is going to want another meal you have to
[01:18.800 --> 01:22.080]  get in their face when they train against tea party people when they train
[01:22.080 --> 01:25.720]  against guys and John dear hats we ought to all be concerned when they train
[01:25.720 --> 01:30.160]  against Christians or libertarians we should be concerned when they train
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.400]  against any particular demographic group because we should be concerned when
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.840]  our government is training to fight its own citizens and they're doing it in
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.480]  place after place after place Joe Biggs and I walk through the AP Hill
[01:43.480 --> 01:48.040]  asymmetric warfare center there's also one in Camp Lejeune North Carolina for
[01:48.040 --> 01:51.600]  the Marines they're building American cities training in those cities
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.160]  training to fight Americans this is yet another place and we have a video that
[01:56.160 --> 02:02.560]  they analyzed that was posted up on the National Guard's own website so they'll
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.960]  we'll have that we report in the in this hour some breaking news a Malaysian
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.480]  Airlines Boeing 777 is reportedly shot down over Ukraine they fear that
[02:12.480 --> 02:15.920]  everyone on board has been lost and of course this was shot down over the area
[02:15.920 --> 02:20.640]  where there is intense fighting in Dnesk you have pro Russian forces fighting the
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.480]  new Ukrainian government there it's been reported by Fox News that it has been
[02:26.480 --> 02:30.600]  shot down other people just say that it is down we'll have to see what's going
[02:30.600 --> 02:34.960]  on that that's developing right now but everyone is an agreement as to the number
[02:34.960 --> 02:41.760]  of people that have died all are feared lost and that would be 295 people that's
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.880]  what happens when you start wars say there is a lot of collateral damage and
[02:47.880 --> 02:51.480]  it doesn't just involve the people in that area we're all very concerned this
[02:51.480 --> 02:58.160]  is something that's going to spend out of control into a worldwide war very if
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.920]  you look at the the Cold War how that's been revived if you look at all the
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.000]  different factors this is something we should all be very concerned about and
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.520]  of course we're in a situation now that is much more dangerous than the Cold War
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.240]  ever was because we have this situation being brought out in the Ukraine we have
[03:15.240 --> 03:19.120]  fighting going on right on the Russian border the Russians understand what's
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.880]  behind this they know that the US is openly bragged about funding this you've
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.040]  also got wars being started by the American government in the Middle East
[03:27.040 --> 03:32.080]  funding al-Qaeda training and funding ISIS and then of course we have our own
[03:32.080 --> 03:36.360]  presence and multiple wars as our border is collapsing there's never been a more
[03:36.360 --> 03:41.400]  dangerous time for America or for the world and right now we are on the cusp
[03:41.400 --> 03:46.520]  of a various very dangerous situation there's also a very dangerous time if
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.760]  you look at if you believe as I do that there is a cyclical nature to human
[03:50.760 --> 03:56.280]  society we're coming up to one of those major cycles and everything is starting
[03:56.280 --> 04:00.200]  to heat up we also have an article that's up on the drudge report armed
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.960]  homeland security agents and community outreach a community outreach to quote
[04:04.960 --> 04:09.320]  let people know that they're in the area this is a story by Paul Joseph Watson
[04:09.320 --> 04:13.520]  currently up on the drudge report this is very reminiscent of what this Dallas
[04:13.520 --> 04:20.000]  County judge did last week or actually a couple weeks ago where he said that he
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.880]  was going to turn over a school to illegal immigrants to house them in the
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.840]  Dallas area and he preemptively went around door to door telling the people
[04:30.840 --> 04:35.640]  in the neighborhood that they they could demonstrate they could use their first
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.720]  moment rights but just remember that you better stay within the law that kind of
[04:39.720 --> 04:43.040]  advanced intimidation that's precisely what's going on this article that's up

[08:24.520 --> 08:29.960]  first hour we have a special report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs about the US
[08:29.960 --> 08:35.120]  army training to fight black Americans but before we go to that report I want
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.360]  to let you know that there's some breaking news out of the Ukraine a
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.120]  Malaysian Airlines a Boeing 777 has reportedly been shot down over the
[08:42.120 --> 08:46.360]  Ukraine this of course happened in the Donetsk area where there is fighting
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.920]  going on between pro-russian forces and the new Ukrainian government they fear
[08:49.920 --> 08:55.200]  that all passengers on board have been lost that would be 295 people who've
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.040]  been killed now because of this war that the globalists have started there this
[09:01.040 --> 09:06.640]  is the saddest aspect of war is when it spills out and it's going to spill out
[09:06.640 --> 09:10.880]  it's going to spill out of that area it's already revived the Cold War we have
[09:10.880 --> 09:13.760]  to be very concerned that it's going to spill out in the entire world it's not
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.160]  going to be just 295 people it's going to be a lot of people dying from this and
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.680]  of course a lot of people have already died in the Ukraine area Fox News is
[09:22.680 --> 09:25.760]  reporting that they've been shot down other people are saying it just crashed
[09:25.760 --> 09:30.200]  but it suspiciously looks like it may have very well been shot down now before
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.320]  we go to this report I want to read you a couple of headlines that are breaking
[09:34.320 --> 09:37.200]  in the news today and let you put this together just think of this as a
[09:37.200 --> 09:41.080]  collective we have this story from yesterday's up on the drudge report from
[09:41.080 --> 09:45.120]  Paul Joseph Watson armed homeland security agents in a quote community
[09:45.120 --> 09:51.120]  outreach to quote let people know they're in the area now this is a lot of
[09:51.120 --> 09:54.840]  federal agents that were collecting in Greenville North Carolina just outside
[09:54.840 --> 09:58.440]  of a bankruptcy court people were alarmed they called the police to find out
[09:58.440 --> 10:01.800]  what's going on is there some kind of a terrorist attack well they were told
[10:01.800 --> 10:06.240]  no they're just in the area to let you know that they're here just a little
[10:06.240 --> 10:10.440]  bit of intimidation just like we saw from the Dallas County judge going door
[10:10.440 --> 10:14.280]  to door telling citizens we don't want you demonstrating against the illegal
[10:14.280 --> 10:17.760]  aliens are going to be bringing into your community if you're going to break
[10:17.760 --> 10:22.760]  the law and of course they have a lot of laws about free speech in Dallas now
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.840]  this county judge doesn't really have any authority to turn over that school
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.000]  but because he was going around door to door intimidating people he got to set
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.440]  next to Obama when Obama came to Dallas Rick Perry was sitting at the end of the
[10:35.440 --> 10:39.840]  table but this county judge was sitting right in front of Obama and you can see
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.000]  the pictures of Obama laughing that's what happens when you tow the line you
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  get a seat at the table quite literally now later in the program the second
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.600]  third hour we're going to have Joel Gilbert the fellow who did the the movie
[10:52.600 --> 10:57.400]  dreams from my real father he's going to be on about his new movie no place like
[10:57.400 --> 11:00.800]  utopia we also have Peter Glidden they're both going to be interviewed by
[11:00.800 --> 11:05.880]  Alex Jones live here on the show but two others stories before we go to the
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.560]  special report from Alex Obama has attacked the second amendment with an
[11:09.560 --> 11:13.200]  executive order this is story up by curtain ammo and fo wars.com he outlaws
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.640]  russian-made ak-47s with a stroke of his unconstitutional pen that's right
[11:19.640 --> 11:25.640]  just declare that you can't have a an entire line of rifles and of course in
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.640]  the article he points out that the administration is saying that the these
[11:30.640 --> 11:36.040]  sanctions are based on the UN and other international mandates would that be the
[11:36.040 --> 11:41.280]  UN arms trade treaty that hasn't been ratified and are multilateral in scope
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.840]  and they involve close cooperation with allied governments well we have a second
[11:45.840 --> 11:48.560]  amendment that prohibits that sort of thing I think it's interesting to note
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.560]  when they get rid of the ak-47 that one of the earliest perhaps the earliest
[11:53.560 --> 11:57.680]  infringement on the second amendment was a supreme court decision that outlawed
[11:57.680 --> 12:02.720]  sawed-off shotgun saying that they were not military weapons not usable by the
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.960]  militia and so they outlawed sawed-off shotguns well that was a lie then
[12:06.960 --> 12:12.240]  because they had already used them in the civil war sawed-off shotguns but
[12:12.240 --> 12:18.680]  nevertheless the idea that it can be infringed like this or by executive order
[12:18.680 --> 12:23.200]  just taken down so we have Homeland Security going door-to-door in a small
[12:23.200 --> 12:28.040]  community just to let people know they're there we have Obama just with a
[12:28.040 --> 12:33.480]  stroke of a pen outlawing a particular type of gun nobody has ever dreamed of
[12:33.480 --> 12:36.920]  doing that before and now he's been given the kill switch to the entire
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.920]  communication system they're going to connect the emergency broadcast system
[12:41.920 --> 12:45.280]  all together from a single point it's been daisy chained they're extending the
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.480]  control this Alex has a special report on that as well but now this next element
[12:50.480 --> 12:53.440]  and of course that may be because he wants to communicate to everybody very
[12:53.440 --> 12:58.480]  quickly after a false flag incident now look at what they're training for they've
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.600]  been talking about how their enemy is the Tea Party libertarians conservatives
[13:02.600 --> 13:09.040]  Christians now they're going after blacks and this is in a doomsday Disneyland as
[13:09.040 --> 13:13.080]  I call it this is a training facility this one run by the National Guard now
[13:13.080 --> 13:16.040]  of course we've been to the Army's training facility at Fort AP Hill I
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.480]  walked through that with Joe Biggs we took pictures of the training facility
[13:20.480 --> 13:25.000]  there there's also a training facility in Camp Lejeune the one in Camp Lejeune
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.320]  for the Marines looks more like a it's targeted more towards neighborhoods
[13:29.320 --> 13:34.640]  towards a rural farm areas the one in AP Hill is more like an urban
[13:34.640 --> 13:38.320]  transportation center there's a lot of things like trains and subways that
[13:38.320 --> 13:43.560]  they're training on now there's this one in the National Guard facility and
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.560]  here's a report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs as they analyze it tonight we
[13:48.560 --> 13:54.680]  quite frankly have some extremely shocking information and that's in a
[13:54.680 --> 14:01.560]  news system that is just full of incredibly disturbing things and we
[14:01.560 --> 14:07.200]  bring you this information not to scare you but to hopefully cause a debate in
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.000]  this country about the serious things that are happening so we can reverse
[14:11.000 --> 14:16.960]  what's unfolding the Department of Homeland Security is always saying that
[14:16.960 --> 14:23.760]  if you see something say something well historically when you see government
[14:23.760 --> 14:27.320]  buying billions of bullets openly saying the American people the main terror
[14:27.320 --> 14:32.040]  threat openly saying that Christians and gun owners are the number one threat
[14:32.040 --> 14:38.160]  even above Al Qaeda and buying thousands of armored vehicles and admitting that
[14:38.160 --> 14:43.680]  they plan to put regular army on the streets of every major city in town and
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.560]  the government sets up a rural affairs commission run by Northcom and the
[14:48.560 --> 14:54.080]  Department of Defense to keep an eye on rural communities while our government
[14:54.080 --> 14:59.000]  is openly funding Al Qaeda and ISIS in the Middle East you know that treason is
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.280]  taking place and so we have seen something and we are saying something and
[15:04.280 --> 15:12.080]  viewers out there one of them will just go by CB in places like Georgia are the
[15:12.080 --> 15:18.080]  human or the true organic human intelligence and our eyes and ears and
[15:18.080 --> 15:23.760]  that's why info wars calm every week breaks national news stories that get
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.520]  picked up by thousands of publications and national television because we are
[15:27.520 --> 15:33.760]  engaged in real journalism here we go wherever the truth leads us now we've
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.920]  seen a long slide towards a paramilitary police state in this country I've been
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.360]  talking about it for a long time made four films on the subject since the late
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.880]  1990s and we are now here they've gone from denying that this is happening to
[15:47.880 --> 15:54.960]  admitting it I struggle to put a headline on this regular army trains to
[15:54.960 --> 16:04.080]  inter Americans regular army trains to take over US cities but but that doesn't
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.760]  encompass how bad this is the end of positive commentatus which it is the
[16:09.760 --> 16:16.680]  1878 law banning regular army engaging in law enforcement operations in the
[16:16.680 --> 16:20.280]  states that's why the governors call up the National Guard not the quote big
[16:20.280 --> 16:27.560]  army this is a big deal and in 2007 2009 and the Defense Authorization Acts the
[16:27.560 --> 16:30.680]  National Defense Authorization Acts they basically removed it and so don't
[16:30.680 --> 16:36.080]  worry we won't you know abuse this new power as we see military at kite
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.240]  festivals in Austin and we see the National Guard going under the
[16:40.240 --> 16:44.880]  president not under the states it's a major transference of power from the
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.760]  already weak states to the out-of-control central government and
[16:48.760 --> 16:54.680]  there's a massive ratcheting up from this training being secret when I first
[16:54.680 --> 17:01.880]  started reporting on it in 1996 to it now being out in the open back in 1996
[17:01.880 --> 17:05.280]  9798 I would go show urban warfare drills they're practicing to confiscate
[17:05.280 --> 17:10.600]  guns and the information was so shocking that they would have the media come out
[17:10.600 --> 17:17.200]  and say no Delta Force was not in Houston or Delta Force was not in San
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.800]  Antonio and until I went interview police chiefs and others that said no
[17:21.800 --> 17:25.360]  no they're here and they're buying people off it appears to be a covert
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.480]  takeover plan now that was Clinton now under Obama it's gone into full gear
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.360]  Bush was involved in it as well but just a fact under Democrats this stuff goes
[17:34.360 --> 17:38.480]  into high gear and again they're saying domestically tea party Christians were
[17:38.480 --> 17:44.360]  veterans are the terror threat not al-Qaeda that is sensational information
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.240]  hopefully if you get this video out people are about to get into the details
[17:47.240 --> 17:53.320]  we can get a debate going in Congress at the state level about this that you
[17:53.320 --> 17:56.400]  out there as viewers have already spurred a debate about this I talked to
[17:56.400 --> 17:59.480]  congressmen and women all the time on and off air and they say they're having
[17:59.480 --> 18:04.800]  hearings on this precisely because of your work so understand that here it's
[18:04.800 --> 18:10.720]  like a horse and carriage or it's like a lock and key it's it goes together you
[18:10.720 --> 18:15.400]  are the reason we know about this this information you're about to see that is
[18:15.400 --> 18:21.720]  big army regular army training to put black people behind bar bar I mean
[18:21.720 --> 18:27.040]  that's the footage that you're about to see that a local who works in the area
[18:27.040 --> 18:32.160]  I'll leave it at that keep seeing really scary stuff going on at the base he
[18:32.160 --> 18:37.400]  sent us some photos of lockdown cities of collapse of the highway shut down of
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.920]  the military training for all sorts of draw-and-quarter and you know
[18:41.920 --> 18:47.480]  confiscation blockading of cities and roads he sent us some photos we're going
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.520]  to show you they took with his GoPro from the highway but he directed us to the
[18:51.520 --> 18:57.520]  YouTube website of guardian centers which is the privately owned facility
[18:57.520 --> 19:01.440]  that gets government contracts where this is going on now this is not reflect
[19:01.440 --> 19:04.640]  on guardian centers they've got all sorts of legitimate firefighter police
[19:04.640 --> 19:08.960]  training military training going on there the issue is the training not the
[19:08.960 --> 19:15.520]  center that the specifics of their own video about guardian center shows us
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.240]  hidden in plain view in between the images of the fire department getting
[19:19.240 --> 19:26.120]  people out of flooded cities to the military apprehending arresting citizens
[19:26.120 --> 19:29.680]  and handing them over to the police just like we saw in Katrina with the gun
[19:29.680 --> 19:33.840]  confiscation that they first tried to deny that's the we're gonna have some
[19:33.840 --> 19:36.960]  more of that report it's a very long report we're gonna have another segment
[19:36.960 --> 19:40.800]  of that coming up in the next in the next segment and also in the segment
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.880]  following that stay with us Alex is going to be talking to Peter Glidden as

[23:58.760 --> 24:12.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight here live in the studio we
[24:12.840 --> 24:15.840]  have a special report that we've been going through we're gonna continue in
[24:15.840 --> 24:19.760]  this segment from Alex Jones got to bring you up to date what's happened is
[24:19.760 --> 24:23.840]  today Obama has attacked the Second Amendment with an executive order this
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.680]  is a story up on infowars.com by Kurt Nemo he has outlawed Russian-made AK-47
[24:30.680 --> 24:35.280]  rifles with a stroke of a pen this is something that he's doing under the
[24:35.280 --> 24:39.280]  National Emergency Act this is from the article he says the criminalization of
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.840]  an entire line of foreign manufactured firearms is possible under the national
[24:44.840 --> 24:50.720]  emergency powers and there is no appeal process well there better be because if
[24:50.720 --> 24:57.680]  he can outlaw any line of firearms then he can outlaw all of them and of course
[24:57.680 --> 25:01.040]  they're making the excuse administration is saying well we're working with the UN
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.000]  this is because of international mandates from the UN well we have a
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.480]  mandate it's called the Constitution where you can't do that but notice that
[25:08.480 --> 25:14.280]  he's doing this as part of the national emergency powers at the same time
[25:14.280 --> 25:19.320]  Obama is saying that he has he's going to be given a kill switch to address the
[25:19.320 --> 25:25.920]  entire nation simultaneously in case of a national emergency and then just
[25:25.920 --> 25:31.200]  yesterday we had a story that armed Homeland Security agents were in
[25:31.200 --> 25:36.200]  Greenville, North Carolina scaring the community but just there so that people
[25:36.200 --> 25:40.040]  would know that they're in the area showing up en masse to intimidate the
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.560]  community and they were very intimidated now we have this video that was given to
[25:44.560 --> 25:48.320]  us by someone who lives in the area where this training is going on we've
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.520]  reported many times and of course Alex has been reporting since the 1990s about
[25:53.520 --> 25:57.840]  these exercises that are training to fight American citizens everybody called
[25:57.840 --> 26:02.960]  him a conspiracy theorist well nobody is saying that anymore still nobody else is
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.680]  talking about this much outside of info wars let's continue with that analysis
[26:06.680 --> 26:12.120]  from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs so let me just give you some of the background on
[26:12.120 --> 26:16.960]  this the latest developments here's an article from 2009 the Pentagon wants
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.080]  authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel in the US from the
[26:21.080 --> 26:24.760]  progressive but it was also in the Associated Press at the time and they
[26:24.760 --> 26:30.400]  are now moving the troops back out of the Middle East other areas to the
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.320]  United States for what they call brigade homeland that is famously also in the
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.080]  Stars and Trikes and Army times here's another one Clarksville online
[26:40.080 --> 26:44.480]  101 airborne soldiers to conduct air assault training in Troy, Tennessee again
[26:44.480 --> 26:49.400]  this is all conditioning the public the troops everybody to just accept this so
[26:49.400 --> 26:52.920]  so the troops aren't villains in this I think they're the most await group out
[26:52.920 --> 26:57.800]  there because of this going on we're talking about the training that's being
[26:57.800 --> 27:01.000]  directed from the White House of the National Security Council not about
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.640]  guardian centers not about the troops want to be clear because we've learned
[27:04.640 --> 27:08.000]  the propaganda they use on the police and military is see they're criticizing
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.960]  you know you're just trying to help people no we're pointing out what's
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.880]  going on inside of these larger operations the real operations here's
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.760]  another one accepting FEMA camp prisoners for illegal immigrants justifies
[27:20.760 --> 27:24.200]  them for Americans we're going to go through this then get to the footage of
[27:24.200 --> 27:28.480]  the black people being thrown in basically the famous center the mock
[27:28.480 --> 27:36.320]  FEMA center again back in 2011 we posted articles warning of the fact that
[27:36.320 --> 27:41.120]  under Rex 84 which is a public plan they would use the collapse of borders as a
[27:41.120 --> 27:47.720]  pretext to spend the Constitution and bring in martial law and at the guardian
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.960]  centers the training is moving towards what is clearly civil emergency or
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.000]  martial law and right here in this article from two years ago where they
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.040]  were finishing the center they admit they have a whole area to simulate
[28:02.040 --> 28:07.280]  New Orleans 9th Ward and what was done there and to be submerged just like
[28:07.280 --> 28:14.720]  Katrina just like the gun confiscation that we witness there there's also a
[28:14.720 --> 28:20.360]  CNN article that breaks this down take a tour of the doomsday Disneyland and
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.120]  again that is this guardian center facility or the largest in the world
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.880]  where this is going on and here's the issue why don't they use military bases
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.640]  for this because it's it's not traditional and sends up red flags to
[28:33.640 --> 28:39.480]  have police and military together training at a military base even though
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.040]  that's going on covertly so they're now doing at these giant private centers
[28:44.040 --> 28:48.800]  now let's go to the big enchilada before we get to the video internment
[28:48.800 --> 28:52.560]  resettlement operations we broke this a couple years ago when it was sent us by
[28:52.560 --> 28:57.120]  military sources after that happened they posted an army dot mill kind of oh
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.480]  it's no big deal see you got a secret document we'll just put it out no big
[29:01.480 --> 29:04.760]  deal like catching your neighbor walking out with your television they claim
[29:04.760 --> 29:08.680]  they were taken to have it repaired or something oh it's no big deal Bob you know
[29:08.680 --> 29:11.640]  or you catch your neighbor and bevel your wife oh I was just you know doing a
[29:11.640 --> 29:18.440]  gynecology exam they released FM 3-39 dot 40 and this document all right we're
[29:18.440 --> 29:21.200]  going to continue with this report this is a short segment we're going to have
[29:21.200 --> 29:24.840]  the rest of this report in the next segment this entire report special
[29:24.840 --> 29:29.680]  report very very important it's going to be posted up on the YouTube site it is

[29:33.760 --> 29:36.600]  from that we're going to have the rest of that and this next segment and of
[29:36.600 --> 29:40.200]  course Alex is going to be back with live in the studio he's going to be

[33:31.720 --> 33:36.080]  joining us in the next hour live in the studio he's working on a breaking story
[33:36.080 --> 33:41.160]  right now we've been playing a special report that he shot with Joe Biggs about
[33:41.160 --> 33:47.480]  a new Army training center actually it's not new but it's newly found out that
[33:47.480 --> 33:51.440]  they're training to fight black Americans and again this is yet another
[33:51.440 --> 33:56.920]  example of what Alex has been talking about since the 1990s and of course it
[33:56.920 --> 34:00.360]  was always a conspiracy theory but now they're putting the videos up they're
[34:00.360 --> 34:03.440]  shooting the videos and putting them on the internet instead of denying that it's
[34:03.440 --> 34:07.320]  happening so he's breaking that down for us let's go back to that report but
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.160]  before we do I want to let you know that fluoride shield is now available at a

[34:47.240 --> 34:50.720]  breaking down and this is something we should all be concerned about you should
[34:50.720 --> 34:54.560]  be concerned that the government is training to fight American citizens
[34:54.560 --> 34:58.960]  whether it's not the demographic group that you're in or not it is still not
[34:58.960 --> 35:02.640]  something we want to see happen especially when we look at the fact that
[35:02.640 --> 35:08.960]  Obama by executive order has just banned all future purchases of AK-47s saying
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.280]  that he has the powers under a national emergency act and he has been given a
[35:14.280 --> 35:17.440]  kill switch to the entire communications system so that he can
[35:17.440 --> 35:21.040]  immediately address everyone that's something that's never happened before
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.440]  does he need those two things because they're planning a false flag because
[35:25.440 --> 35:28.520]  they're planning to fight American citizens that's something I've been
[35:28.520 --> 35:33.680]  talking about since Rex 84 member Oliver North Ronald Reagan 1984 that's
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.920]  where the name comes from Rex 84 Alex Jones continues to break this down for
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.880]  us let's continue with that report they released fm 3-39 dot 40 and this
[35:43.880 --> 35:48.480]  document says social security numbers how to round up the American people we
[35:48.480 --> 35:52.240]  have articles on info wars dot com about it where you can see the subsections
[35:52.240 --> 35:56.200]  were more than 20 times it says American citizens social security numbers how to
[35:56.200 --> 36:00.640]  process how to get our biometrics just like we were citizens of Fallujah Iraq it
[36:00.640 --> 36:04.800]  goes through all of it and first they tried to deny it then they admitted it
[36:04.800 --> 36:10.920]  we've also seen training in places like Arcadia Iowa where they said the paper
[36:10.920 --> 36:14.560]  they're working with a local gun shop and the citizens do door-to-door gun
[36:14.560 --> 36:19.920]  confiscation drill for training here in America once that blew up they started
[36:19.920 --> 36:23.520]  to back off we got the governor to respond in Tennessee a few years ago
[36:23.520 --> 36:29.360]  when they had regular army with National Guard state police ATF the FBI local
[36:29.360 --> 36:33.960]  police all putting them under a unified federal FEMA command running an illegal
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.440]  checkpoint on one of the major highways searching vehicles so again this is just
[36:38.440 --> 36:46.120]  changing the culture bringing all of this in but I want to play from a
[36:46.120 --> 36:52.040]  promotional video put out by Guardian Centers some of the video for you right
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.400]  now and we've been showing some of it as well a lot of been talking here where
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.400]  again interspersed with the firefighters the other legitimate things it shows the
[37:01.400 --> 37:08.560]  military rounding people up and every one of them is black now that's news
[37:08.560 --> 37:14.040]  worthy right there I've been to these drills where they all are farmers wearing
[37:14.040 --> 37:17.280]  John Deere caps and stuff saying you know you can't take my land you can't
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.560]  take my guns very scary stuff but it was a black farmer white farmer Hispanic
[37:22.560 --> 37:28.040]  farmer little extra black folks I mean it obviously saying oh it's for Al Qaeda
[37:28.040 --> 37:31.400]  that's a bad group but it's really for all Americans oh well blacks you know
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.800]  they're kind of look down on quietly by some people oh look it's for blacks so
[37:34.800 --> 37:40.760]  it's okay it's military and white guys white civilians looking on as groups of
[37:40.760 --> 37:44.480]  blacks tumble over cars and you know get rounded up and thrown behind barbed
[37:44.480 --> 37:49.000]  wire I mean this is pretty outrageous but don't expect Jesse Jackson or Al
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.280]  Sharpton the racepaders to say anything they're just there to create more racial
[37:53.280 --> 37:56.360]  division in this country not actually point out that there's preparation to
[37:56.360 --> 38:00.320]  target black communities which are under gun control like Chicago and has the
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.880]  highest crime rate in the world which are under the fake drug war that's
[38:04.880 --> 38:09.920]  bringing down Chicago just like Mexico is collapsing it's the policies that are
[38:09.920 --> 38:13.640]  causing this cultural collapse but here's some of the promotional video
[38:13.640 --> 38:28.760]  hiding in plain view for those of you who are listening this is video footage
[38:28.760 --> 38:33.920]  this is a black lady who's getting beaten by some soldiers here they've
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.440]  got concertino wire that they've set up and as you can see if you're looking at
[38:38.440 --> 38:45.240]  the video live on our website everyone who is a few more articles there is
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.800]  black we'll give you a larger picture as we connect the dots here and then we're
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.280]  gonna go to Staff Sergeant a retired Joe Biggs to specifically analyze some of
[38:54.280 --> 38:59.840]  this video that shows regular army engaging in civilian suppression
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.920]  basically no other way to describe it look at this headline from today that
[39:03.920 --> 39:07.640]  was picked up by drudgereport.com we're gonna show a short clip from the larger
[39:07.640 --> 39:12.000]  newscast here in just a moment armed Homeland Security agents in community
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.160]  outreach to let people know they're in the area and to remind them about the
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.040]  snitch program and we'll go ahead and play a clip of that now. Homeland Security
[39:21.040 --> 39:24.200]  officers till 90 years side they were there as part of their community
[39:24.200 --> 39:29.160]  outreach to let people know that they are in the area they also were there to
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.120]  remind people that if they see something say something especially when they see
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.200]  anything suspicious happening outside of a federal building. Again it is
[39:37.200 --> 39:45.720]  essential to understand we are seeing a explosion of paramilitary preparation for
[39:45.720 --> 39:49.720]  gun confiscation martial law roundup civil unrest you name it. Is it the
[39:49.720 --> 39:53.520]  border being collapsed by design is that part of it? Clearly. Is it the dollar
[39:53.520 --> 39:57.800]  being deserted worldwide by design? Clearly. Is it war in Ukraine and possible
[39:57.800 --> 40:03.120]  war with Russia? Clearly. The issue is it's George Soros and the globalist on
[40:03.120 --> 40:08.240]  record bragging they're behind the open borders in the open border society that
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.240]  they're behind the Ukraine takeover that they're behind ISIS and the Arab
[40:12.240 --> 40:16.000]  Spring. I mean they are starting what appears to be the beginning of World War
[40:16.000 --> 40:21.640]  3 right now. That's where all this leads and the government is on full drill to
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.280]  lock everything down and come after the American people. So this is really an
[40:25.280 --> 40:30.760]  emergency alert here and again a few years ago we saw these weird internal
[40:30.760 --> 40:35.000]  Homeland Security training videos and then public ones about see something say
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.880]  something where every terrorist was a white business executive and I said
[40:38.880 --> 40:42.160]  they're rebranding to the Tea Party watch and they've done that now I mean you
[40:42.160 --> 40:47.200]  could see it first internal saying our new enemies the Tea Party white people
[40:47.200 --> 40:52.000]  then it goes public then it becomes policy people said oh you're just being
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.400]  racist worried about white people no if there's videos where all the terrorists
[40:56.400 --> 41:00.360]  are white people and then internally they say the enemies the Tea Party and
[41:00.360 --> 41:05.520]  gun owners you know what's next and we were proven right well when it's showing
[41:05.520 --> 41:09.600]  nothing but black people I've got a big concern as well I've got a concern of it
[41:09.600 --> 41:14.200]  was showing black white Hispanic Asian but but they're doing it to kind of
[41:14.200 --> 41:17.200]  sell the idea of well this is a trouble-making group the army's only for
[41:17.200 --> 41:23.640]  them so the general public will accept it so they're showing minority
[41:23.640 --> 41:26.960]  communities that we're gonna take the rights of whitey and they're showing you
[41:26.960 --> 41:30.240]  know the law enforcement you know community that's in some areas I guess
[41:30.240 --> 41:36.400]  well white bastion or whatever oh it's it's for the blacks no folks it's for
[41:36.400 --> 41:39.480]  everybody who was the German preacher that said first they came for the
[41:39.480 --> 41:41.960]  communists and I wasn't a communist said nothing and then they came for the
[41:41.960 --> 41:45.560]  labor unions I wasn't labor union then they came for me and there was no one
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.360]  else to stand up this is for everybody this is about taking your pension funds
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.640]  it's about taking over now you can look up again the army times you name it
[41:54.640 --> 41:57.400]  admitting that they want to set up brigade homeland that was six years ago
[41:57.400 --> 42:01.600]  they've now done it they're rolling it out I mentioned this article guardsman
[42:01.600 --> 42:05.600]  to conduct urban training at Arcadia in April they admitted gun confiscation
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.200]  drill in here and they got all upset when we said that and you know reported
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.240]  on it and said that they hadn't said that we had the current one we've also
[42:13.240 --> 42:17.520]  got FEMA camp prisoners again we mentioned that using the illegals to
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.120]  prime that pump we have the governor responding and saying the feds can't do
[42:21.120 --> 42:25.480]  that anymore I pretend to see so so that's the good news is that you can
[42:25.480 --> 42:30.800]  say no to all this but for those that are in denial about Posse commentatis and
[42:30.800 --> 42:35.120]  what the NDA has changed in the last few years incrementally to where there's
[42:35.120 --> 42:41.000]  nothing left I wanted to go to again Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs retired to give
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.400]  us his breakdown because he served in Iraq and Afghanistan with a lot of the
[42:44.400 --> 42:48.800]  groups that are now coming home to literally go after the American people
[42:48.800 --> 42:52.160]  as veterans can't get health care and are getting the word they can't buy guns
[42:52.160 --> 42:57.280]  anymore with no evidence or you know no reason is all this is now pointed at us
[42:57.280 --> 43:01.560]  and the military appreciates these transmissions because on average I can't
[43:01.560 --> 43:06.200]  imagine a group more informed than Army and Marines Air Force you name it
[43:06.200 --> 43:09.320]  because again they're decompartmentalized they're in the middle of this
[43:09.320 --> 43:13.480]  they see what's happening Joe before you analyze these patches for folks I want
[43:13.480 --> 43:17.760]  to get your take overall you've been sitting here tonight while we're breaking
[43:17.760 --> 43:21.880]  down this investigative report here in analysis for viewers the last 15 minutes
[43:21.880 --> 43:26.800]  any thoughts just overall as a citizen as a veteran a combat veteran seeing all
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.360]  this well what one of the things like that you said is that the veterans
[43:30.360 --> 43:33.680]  overseas are getting ready to come home to this and it reminded me of the past
[43:33.680 --> 43:37.120]  few days I have a buddy who's stationed in Japan I've got another that's in
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.000]  Afghanistan they can't see a lot of these websites and they're coming to me and
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.440]  saying hey Joe what's really happening in America right now what's going on at
[43:46.440 --> 43:51.800]  the border why is our police being militarized so much and I have to tell
[43:51.800 --> 43:55.120]  them and they it breaks their heart every single time they're like why is
[43:55.120 --> 43:58.680]  this happening right now do we am I really going to come home to this right
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.400]  now and they're scared of what what's happening to America right now because
[44:02.400 --> 44:05.360]  I don't blame them because they're not traders yeah they're not they don't want
[44:05.360 --> 44:09.520]  anything to do with this you know most of them go over there like I said for a
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.840]  good purpose you know a lot of them want the college to benefit something like
[44:12.840 --> 44:16.320]  that none of them want to go and come back and be trained to take over cities
[44:16.320 --> 44:20.040]  here in America no one has that no one wants to do that a lot of them do it
[44:20.040 --> 44:23.840]  because of family like here you're dead yeah my father I mean it was in my blood
[44:23.840 --> 44:28.320]  to join the military my father did it my great-grandfather and it's just
[44:28.320 --> 44:32.760]  something that we did in our family if you were a male you joined the military
[44:32.760 --> 44:36.000]  there's nothing wrong with that and a lot of these guys are saying what's
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.200]  happening back here and it's literally breaking their heart every day to know
[44:39.200 --> 44:43.640]  that our country is sleeping away while they're over there fighting for their
[44:43.640 --> 44:49.000]  country well I want Joe the people that are running this to know that they're
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.120]  not doing this in the dark the military is over 85% awake that that's what I
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.320]  found even officers on the street I agree completely everybody I talked to is
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.600]  100% with the information we're putting out there saying that spot on what do
[45:05.600 --> 45:07.800]  you think the establishment's thinking I mean they're not gonna get away with
[45:07.800 --> 45:12.040]  this I just don't understand I mean this video we're about to show it's not
[45:12.040 --> 45:15.720]  National Guard that's their job to take care of stuff here back in the homeland
[45:15.720 --> 45:20.400]  this is big army regular army third infantry the third infantry division
[45:20.400 --> 45:25.160]  first Calvary first armored division so this is the tip of the spear yes explain
[45:25.160 --> 45:28.360]  to folks what that means this is not just regular army this is the absolute
[45:28.360 --> 45:32.680]  shock forces yes third ID is one of the biggest infantry units there some of the
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.400]  first ones are going first armored division is one of the biggest armored
[45:36.400 --> 45:40.520]  you know your tanks your paladins things like that and first Calvary is one of
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.200]  the best biggest Calvary divisions there is so they've got the three biggest
[45:45.200 --> 45:50.120]  guys in there right now training at this place for you know an apparent
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.240]  martial law takeover it's unbelievable truth is stranger than fiction it's
[45:55.240 --> 45:58.840]  really happening we've seen the signs for a long time but it was over the
[45:58.840 --> 46:04.520]  horizon now it's in our face and before we get to these patches a little bit of
[46:04.520 --> 46:09.440]  gallows humor here some comic relief but it's also a good analogy if you think
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.880]  about the first Ghostbusters movie I think it's a great comedy they're
[46:13.880 --> 46:19.560]  talking about normal paranormal activity being the size of a Twinkie and now the
[46:19.560 --> 46:22.880]  paranormal activities the size of a giant you know 20 40 foot long Twinkie
[46:22.880 --> 46:28.320]  well let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic
[46:28.320 --> 46:32.600]  energy in the New York area according to this morning sample it would be a
[46:32.600 --> 46:39.680]  Twinkie 35 feet long weighing approximately 600 pounds that's a big
[46:39.680 --> 46:45.680]  Twinkie normal paramilitary activity in a free society doesn't exist I mean it
[46:45.680 --> 46:51.000]  isn't going on now it's just off the charts giant is the point and it's
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.760]  accelerating it's building you can see it it's like an enemy army lining up
[46:56.760 --> 47:00.840]  against your border for war but it's not even a foreign country it's our own
[47:00.840 --> 47:04.560]  military that's why they're freaking out you do that's a good analogy Joe oh
[47:04.560 --> 47:09.240]  definitely I mean it's it just imagine opening up and you're sitting in your
[47:09.240 --> 47:12.720]  house and here explosions your helicopters flying overhead and you
[47:12.720 --> 47:15.840]  you know you peek through your blind real quick and you look outside and it's
[47:15.840 --> 47:19.760]  U.S. military it's army with American flags on their shoulders and you're
[47:19.760 --> 47:23.480]  sitting there like what's why you on our streets what are you doing here and they
[47:23.480 --> 47:26.680]  admit that to acclimate everyone look at the Boston bombing ease it in you ease
[47:26.680 --> 47:30.040]  it in look at the Boston bombing going to everybody's houses and oh you're a
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.160]  black lady you're a blonde or lady you look nothing like the guy we're looking
[47:33.160 --> 47:35.680]  for we're gonna drag you out with a gun to your head we're gonna drive around
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.280]  pointing guns at you it's all a power grab yeah it's a mind-blowing I every
[47:40.280 --> 47:43.680]  day this you know every day that something passes like this I just want
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.520]  to understand how we're getting to this what does your gut tell you is it all of
[47:47.520 --> 47:51.240]  the collapsing border the dollar the stage takeover or is it one of those
[47:51.240 --> 47:54.960]  things the collapsing border war with Russia why do you think they've got this
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.800]  in such high gear well the thing with the border I'm thinking they want to
[47:58.800 --> 48:03.280]  import this poverty they want to essentially we're pulling the border
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.480]  patrol agents away from the border and then they're talking about bringing in
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.880]  National Guard so what does that do that start scaring people you start seeing
[48:10.880 --> 48:13.800]  National Guard up and down the streets you're thinking martial law it's the
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.360]  cover yes the cover to be the first phase I agree
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.600]  completely once that happens on the border and it becomes everyday norm that
[48:21.600 --> 48:24.920]  you're seeing the tanks rolling up and down the streets the Humvees m-wraps and
[48:24.920 --> 48:29.440]  soldiers with the m-4s strapped to their chest next thing you have these guys the
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.880]  big army coming in the first arm division the first have third infantry
[48:34.880 --> 48:38.280]  division these guys will be on the streets in the m-wraps along with the
[48:38.280 --> 48:44.160]  military militarized police as well caught on mighty and the public will
[48:44.160 --> 48:49.040]  think they're here to help protect it's protected and served you know it's and
[48:49.040 --> 48:52.240]  then it will set the precedent that we're permanently under martial law yeah
[48:52.240 --> 48:55.760]  completely it's exactly what they're going for but they're gonna call it
[48:55.760 --> 49:00.440]  civil emergency once it happens most these people that are sleeping sheeple
[49:00.440 --> 49:05.080]  it they won't even care because it's gradually happened the people who are
[49:05.080 --> 49:08.120]  awake right now we're the ones they're pulling our hair out every day you know
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.200]  just stressed out we see the tyranny we see what's happening these guys aren't
[49:12.200 --> 49:15.320]  even paying attention when it happens they won't even care they're bringing us
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.600]  into a permanent emergency and the groups that are waking up are political
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.840]  people that are savvy patriots because we're the targets of the next phase and
[49:23.840 --> 49:27.280]  the police and military because they know this is not this was not legal just a
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.120]  few years ago they had to change laws to do this well one of the things they're
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.560]  doing though too is the failed VA what happens when you can't get your veterans
[49:35.560 --> 49:38.480]  to health care they need they don't get better they can't fight back just make
[49:38.480 --> 49:42.560]  them you just make them they can't fight back you're taking enemy away that's
[49:42.560 --> 49:44.800]  what they're doing they're planning they're saying hey weren't these guys
[49:44.800 --> 49:48.600]  are trained they have the information the knowledge to defeat us we're not we're
[49:48.600 --> 49:51.960]  going to deny them the health care they need so they can't fight back when we
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.280]  roll on this martial law these guys will be dead in the street basically laying
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.840]  there internal bleeding whatever's going on unable to fight back after so long
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.320]  you're talking about yourself what do you think of the illegals in South Texas to

[53:10.400 --> 53:14.520]  thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living alone
[53:14.520 --> 53:19.320]  it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that
[53:19.320 --> 53:23.440]  passing motors and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV when
[53:23.440 --> 53:28.640]  I'm actually away from home. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a

[54:09.400 --> 54:12.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight now Alex is going to be
[54:12.960 --> 54:16.720]  joining us in the next hour he's working on a breaking story we also have a
[54:16.720 --> 54:20.720]  report from him about Obama being given a kill switch to the entire
[54:20.720 --> 54:25.760]  communication system now look at the context of what's going on we've got
[54:25.760 --> 54:31.640]  the Homeland Security armed agents in a North Carolina community telling people
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.560]  that they just want them to know that they're there intimidating them with
[54:35.560 --> 54:40.240]  their presence telling them if you see something you better say something well
[54:40.240 --> 54:44.520]  I see something I see Obama preparing to address the entire nation
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.280]  simultaneously perhaps after a false flag but even more importantly I see Obama
[54:49.280 --> 54:56.760]  by executive order affecting a gun ban this time just on AK-47s this is a
[54:56.760 --> 55:00.840]  trial balloon what is he appealing to he's appealing to his national
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.160]  emergency powers he's saying there's some kind of a national emergency that
[55:05.160 --> 55:11.080]  requires him to ban AK-47s well if he can ban AK-47s he can ban any and all
[55:11.080 --> 55:16.760]  guns and ammunition's claiming that it's a national emergency now this is
[55:16.760 --> 55:19.880]  something's been going on for a while as Kurt Nemo points out in his article
[55:19.880 --> 55:24.320]  American civilians have been buying as many AK-47s from Russian gun manufacturers
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.800]  as the Russian military and police combined people were concerned that it
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.600]  was going to be banned and they were called conspiracy theorists they were
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.320]  called paranoid well now we see what's happening and I see something else that's
[55:37.320 --> 55:42.800]  going on I see our government training to fight American citizens everywhere
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.560]  and for AP Hill in Virginia I see them in Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.320]  now we see them in this what CNN calls a doomsday Disneyland in Georgia where
[55:54.320 --> 55:57.840]  they're training to fight black Americans that's right we want to break
[55:57.840 --> 56:01.640]  people into different groups pit them against each other Balkan eyes the
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.240]  country that's why the administration is always hammering home this racism
[56:06.240 --> 56:11.080]  charge here's the rest of that report from Alex Jones and Joe Biggs open up
[56:11.080 --> 56:14.320]  all these centers for these illegal aliens but we're not doing anything for
[56:14.320 --> 56:18.200]  homeless veterans we're not doing anything for Americans in general who
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.120]  need the help of America they're not doing anything look at how they're
[56:22.120 --> 56:27.040]  turning off the power plant shipping our jobs overseas devaluing the dollar
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.040]  they are destroying this country in closing let's look at some of these
[56:30.040 --> 56:33.000]  patches Joe all right so some of the video right here you're going to see is
[56:33.000 --> 56:39.200]  pretty disturbing actual big army out here training to put people into FEMA
[56:39.200 --> 56:44.040]  camps essentially you will have them taking them into custody detaining them
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.600]  and handing them over to police to be held so right here we have a third
[56:48.600 --> 56:53.000]  infantry division patch you'll also see a first armored division which is out
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.280]  of El Paso Texas and then you'll see a first Calvary division patch as well
[56:58.280 --> 57:04.520]  helicopters coming in soldiers it looks fine and Danny then you got the
[57:04.520 --> 57:11.360]  Constantine or why right here soldier why guy actually fighting an African
[57:11.360 --> 57:16.520]  American citizen getting her trying to detain her until the cops can come and
[57:16.520 --> 57:23.000]  put her in a camp and there you go this is what's happening right now in our
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.040]  backyard every day and then as you watch longer they're all black look you got
[57:28.040 --> 57:31.760]  black guys right there yeah they're the only ones that flip over collars and go
[57:31.760 --> 57:38.720]  and riot apparently then they burn it
[57:38.960 --> 57:44.440]  you said a burning car these centers are popping up everywhere right now the
[57:44.440 --> 57:48.280]  one that we saw in Virginia there's the the Marine base one now that looks more
[57:48.280 --> 57:52.960]  like a rural suburbia kind with the churches and all that as well and now
[57:52.960 --> 57:58.720]  we have this this is even more in depth this is completely mind-blowing it gives
[57:58.720 --> 58:02.440]  me chills watching this to see the links are going to the training they have
[58:02.440 --> 58:07.320]  that they're going through to bring this to our country on our streets we're

[58:29.440 --> 58:32.520]  because they say he's a black president we've seen a lot of criticism out of
[58:32.520 --> 58:36.920]  Chicago now we sit there training to fight black people and Joel Gilbert who
[58:36.920 --> 58:40.480]  Alex Jones gonna be talking to will have some interesting updates on that stay

[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.840]  we're seeing yet again more evidence that the government is training to fight
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.440]  American citizens especially by breaking them into different demographic groups
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.520]  and pitting them against each other that's one of the main concerns about
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.080]  this massive opening of the border we know how this government likes to play
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.280]  the racism card likes to balkanize the public and there's no better example of
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.520]  that than this report let's finish up this report that we're running from Alex
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:17.880]  Jones and Joe Biggs from last night's nightly news this nightmare will come
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:23.880]  true if we don't wake up from it and say no it's just that simple the good news
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:30.880]  is the military knows how illegal this is knows how bad it is but can they get
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.760]  the word out can we get the word out can you get the word out and what do we
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:41.880]  call this report tonight Obama preparing martial law a big army a regular army or

[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:56.560]  story preparations for martial law goes into high gear you know breaking video
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.760]  because he's so much of this is headlines and I share with you our
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:07.440]  knowledge as viewers of our frustrations because my problem is I
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.080]  underestimate how bad things are I don't exaggerate most of the time that's
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:20.840]  rare when we get it wrong and and and say that it's you know worse than it
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.760]  actually is it's usually much worse than we even thought so I don't even know how

[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.080]  same plane though they're talking about the passenger plane there's also a
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.680]  Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 that's been reportedly shot down over the Ukraine

[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.760]  in in all of these different areas they are pulling everything together and at
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:40.080]  the same time Obama says as a national emergency he is asserting his power to

[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.200]  creating national emergencies he's creating the crisis he's using it as

[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:23.020]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:30.660]  we're live ladies and gentlemen on this Thursday 17th day of July 2014 you just
[01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:36.660]  heard David Knight in the first hour traffic copping some of the special
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:42.740]  reports we shot last night dealing with the bombshell information that we've
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:48.100]  received from people in the local area photos video you name it confirmed by
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:54.860]  government documents and by the training center's own promotional videos that
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:09:01.020]  regular army the endopacic commentatus is training basically to target well
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:06.100]  black people because everyone in their video and other videos we have are black
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:11.860]  in multiple training operations now again they've had other training missions
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:16.020]  where they say the new terrorists are the domestic tea party in training videos
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:22.020]  and we made a big deal about that a few years ago because they were all white and
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:25.380]  they said you basically in those manuals that it's white people were worried
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:30.460]  about so Jack Spratt could eat no fat his wife could eat no lean between the
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:34.060]  two of them they lick the platter clean but they always shell it like we're gonna
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:38.140]  target this group we're gonna target that group but when you get down to the
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:43.620]  end of the road they're targeting everybody but under Rex 84 they use
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:48.340]  civil unrest collapse the border to bring in permanent martial law suspension
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:54.460]  of the Constitution but they will target quote inner-city minorities that are
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.580]  seen as poor and on welfare and who is believable blow up and riot if their
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:04.700]  welfare checks don't come you know that's always been pushed and sold and
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.900]  it's probably true to a certain extent but again then they create an economic
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:15.580]  climate show that that happens and then the military is actually needed to come
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:20.380]  in because things do break down but the larger issue is who triggered the
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:27.220]  crisis to begin with to allow it to happen the political class will not get
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:35.020]  away with this if we have a debate about it right now and show the fact that they
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:42.900]  open the borders they advertise to bring the illegals in this is a staged
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:49.700]  provocation a false flag that's why we harp on that so much obviously the big
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:53.020]  news just breaking in the last 20 minutes or so
[01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:59.220]  Ukraine advisor Malaysian airline jet shot down by missile near Ukraine Russia
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:04.620]  border that's CBS news and they're already trying to blame the Russians
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:11.180]  Ukraine Russian rocket may have downed military plane CBS news a Ukrainian
[01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:19.620]  military transport plane was shot down but that was a separate plane that was
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:24.700]  shot down on Monday this the Ukrainian official says today is a passenger
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:30.220]  liner from Malaysia with 295 people on board believed to all be dead and
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:35.900]  there's amazing film footage news footage already of the wreckage and the
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:44.420]  smoke on the horizon there near the Russian border this is not the Malaysian
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:48.740]  flight that's been dominating news for six months or whatever it is that
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:55.220]  disappeared somewhere in the Pacific clearly a cover-up there no this is
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:03.380]  another Malaysian flight this is getting very very bizarre very very suspicious
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:11.940]  all I can say and it's too early to be able to speculate but the FAA has now
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.740]  put out a worldwide alert to aircraft flying out of the United States of
[01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:23.260]  North America into the caucuses not just Ukraine that entire area FAA has
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:30.820]  warned airlines to avoid Crimea because of conflict you to go over what we know
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.020]  Ukrainian officials had a passenger plane carrying 295 people was shot down
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.860]  Thursday over a town in the east of the country and Malaysia Airlines tweeted
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.980]  that it had lost connection with one of its flights over Ukraine airspace and
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:49.860]  again the latest is they've confirmed it did indeed go down a source told their
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.660]  facts that the plane began to drop afterwards and was found burning on the
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:13:03.220]  ground on Ukrainian territory the plane was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:11.660]  Lumpur before it went down according to Reuters oh I think it's safe to say I'm
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.460]  not gonna be getting on any Malaysian Airlines anytime soon very tragic
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:19.980]  Malaysian airliner again down in Ukraine with 295 aboard a Malaysian
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:25.300]  Airlines Boeing 777 that's a big and in route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur
[01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:31.260]  295 souls on board crashed Thursday in Ukraine near the Russian border after
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.420]  reportedly being hit by a missile remember our government gave 15,000
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:39.540]  heat-taking missiles and aircraft missiles to Al Qaeda I'm not saying Al
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.780]  Qaeda did this but this is just a taste of things to come according to an
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:47.580]  advisor to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry Malaysian Airlines confirmed on
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:53.460]  its Facebook page that Ukrainian air traffic control lost contact with flight
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:58.300]  MH 17 about 30 miles from the Russian Ukraine border the airline said the
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:05.580]  plane was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew members now the Russians have
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.500]  moved in special ops and they pretty much admitted that now and are shooting
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:18.060]  on helicopters and Ukrainian military NATO aircraft that's what they are Russia
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.460]  said a few days ago they may start targeted strikes inside the country
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:27.820]  after they were shelled this could be Russia
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:34.940]  basically engaged in friendly fire or shooting innocence collateral damage
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:40.220]  but knowing the false flag activities of the globalist what they went up to the
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:45.220]  lies they've been putting out over there I would lean towards the fact this is
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:50.020]  right on the border with Russia that Ukraine or a NATO op would shoot this
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:54.700]  down to create a new way to demonize Russia and as a pretext to escalate the
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:15:00.180]  war there so this is getting really serious I don't know at this point but
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:06.460]  Russia has been trying to de-escalate things while the West has started this
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:12.140]  whole thing don't forget that and over through the elected government has been
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:15.740]  been destabilizing who's running al-Qaeda and ISIS into the whole Middle East
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.460]  globalist who's shutting off our power plants globalist who's going after our
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.980]  guns globalist who's opening our borders globalist I mean hurt no more
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:27.220]  wrote an article two days ago where it's George Soros admitting he's behind the
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:31.180]  open border move and the illegals pouring in admitting he's behind Ukraine
[01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:35.620]  saying I did it which I think he's taking too much credit he's a big part of it
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:40.020]  saying they're part of the Arab Spring and turning loose all these groups that
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:50.540]  it's I mean on every front George Soros so I'm not lionizing or de-ifying
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:16:00.380]  pootie-poot is bush-calling I am simply pointing out that this is all very very
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:07.660]  very very very very very suspicious and it's just par for the course Malaysian
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.860]  airliner down in Ukraine with 295 on board and the crew just put up on TV
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:16.700]  screen of your TV viewer more from the Malaysian Airlines Facebook with a new
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:20.660]  announcement perhaps we can put that back up and I can read from that but
[01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:29.420]  we'll continue to give you updates today as all of this unfolds we do have Joel
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.540]  Gilbert coming on to talk about Obama's plan to wreck the country a new film he
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:37.700]  has and I'm tempted to move him though because there's so much news I think
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.860]  we'll just go ahead and follow through with the interview
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.500]  Malaysian Airlines confirms it received notification was Ukrainian ATC that it
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:52.780]  lost contact with flight MH 17 at 1415 Greenwich meantime or Imperial
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:17:01.420]  British time at 30 kilometers from Tomka waypoint approximately 50 kilometers
[01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:07.820]  from the Russian Ukraine border so that's pretty far inside Ukraine flight
[01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:13.260]  MH 17 operated by Boeing 777 you know I find it hard to believe that here's why
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.740]  I think it leans towards Ukraine and NATO
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:31.180]  the Russians don't stand a game shooting down an aircraft like this in
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:40.340]  broad daylight it will be blamed on them regardless and I don't believe that the
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:46.380]  Russian military would mistake a giant passenger jet on a scheduled flight and
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:53.780]  shoot it down and you notice Ukraine within I've got the time stamp here
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:18:01.380]  within a minute or two of this break in 30 minutes ago within a minute or two
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:12.100]  within a minute or two they had already come out and said they think it's Russia
[01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:19.100]  and last time I checked Russia is just saying they don't know Boeing 777
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:24.900]  traveling from Amsterdam with 295 on board Malaysian Airlines lost
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:31.860]  connection with flight report man was flying report was flying 33,000 feet

[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:48.540]  we've got all the same links and updates on infowars.com we're gonna
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:56.860]  create a Ukraine passenger shootdown page on info wars.com right now and put
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.980]  all these links in there as well but it's been shot down and this will become a
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:07.540]  whole new distraction about the war it'll be you know whoever's behind this
[01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:15.660]  deserves to be attacked and of course our media will say it's the Russians and
[01:19:15.660 --> 01:19:19.460]  now this will distract from the medical breakdown on the border
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:24.260]  Gallup polls showing the illegals of the top problem citizens say national
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.980]  poll the majority say send them home now report Obama vows to reduce

[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:29.740]  listening to the radio. George Drake was saying seashores of old Mexico. It sounded so good. I've got an idea. I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:34.300]  Yeah folks we border Latin America and we've got our reporters down in South
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:39.580]  Texas at that resort that the media was talking about where they were going to
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:43.540]  store all the kids and the website and the photos look like a great place. Well
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:49.460]  our reporters got there last night and their reservation was cancelled and they
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.140]  said we don't want media here talking about what's going on with this quote
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:25:00.340]  Baptist Church charity that it turns out just as Baptist in name and it's
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:08.220]  basically like a giant GPS child orphanage system and we've now got
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.700]  footage of the facility it's got a lot of nice amenities but it's not been
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:21.220]  upkept so it is not as luxurious as press reports were saying and there are
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:26.500]  people staying there contractors and others but it does have barber shops and
[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:34.580]  thousand dollar a day meeting rooms but the facility has definitely seen its
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:38.500]  heyday but I'll tell you one thing it's a lot better than what the veterans are
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:43.980]  getting and what the troops stay in and the larger issue is the 50 plus
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.380]  million dollar contract that the government was going to give this
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:52.580]  charity and they've claimed that it's backing out now that that's a tactic we
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.740]  see so a story goes away and then the contract comes back and we're gonna
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.420]  investigate this charity we're looking into it but then it's the Baptist it's
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:06.020]  the Catholic Church it's basically these are all businesses now it's got
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:13.340]  hot tub swimming pools you name it free luxury resort free legal says 100,000
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:19.340]  rooms excuse me thousand dollar rooms for rent Obama administration funds
[01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:26.380]  hotel for undocumented immigrants notice how even info wars use the quasi
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:33.980]  politically correct thing undocumented immigrants first it's illegal alien then
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:39.660]  it's undocumented worker undocumented migrant now it's don't even say migrant
[01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:45.020]  just say unaccompanied child like when you were a kid and get put on Southwest
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.460]  Airlines to go see grandma and mom and wave at you and daddy wave at you get on
[01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:54.460]  a plane and fly down the issue is they are advertising that people need to come
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:27:00.940]  to this country and compared to Guatemala Nicaragua El Salvador and
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:11.980]  Venezuela and the rest of it these are absolutely totally and completely nice
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:18.580]  facilities and they're all getting health care I just want to illustrate the
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:21.380]  preferential treatment and discrimination it's not even a reflection on these
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.780]  people I don't blame them they're being used as a pawn but Joe Biggs in our
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:31.300]  office combat veteran blown up repeatedly in armored vehicles
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:39.460]  shrapnel shot all of it literally has to end up going and paying for his own
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:44.940]  health care at the hospital because he coughs up blood from being inside a
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:50.500]  burning vehicle that other veteran we had near his we'll forget his name is arm
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:58.940]  blown off face pretty much blown away Mario Lopez he coughs up blood it
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:11.780]  burned his insides as well and I mean I've been I don't like what Joe Biggs
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.660]  I mean I've seen with a shirt off and he's got holes all over him and the
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:18.900]  whole point is he cannot get in they get there and they look at him and they go
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:21.740]  okay we're such another meaning two weeks from now and he comes in a few
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:26.900]  weeks later they go all right I'll come back in another meeting he's on a death
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:32.300]  panel list ladies and gentlemen you understand it's on purpose they got a
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:38.100]  brand new facility plenty of people he's not getting the health care now if you
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:41.060]  fit the right site profile and you play along with the system and you were some
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:45.620]  desk jockey and they're not scared of you you get great health care it's your

[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:08.580]  know his robotic arm and the rest of it a robot arm and it just shows how much
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:14.180]  they hate veterans ladies and gentlemen the criminals that have hijacked this
[01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:18.220]  government there it is after five years of captivity

[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:52.340]  I have a present for you I brought you some ruby slippers
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:35:03.340]  I know I'm making a documentary I'd like to talk to you do you mind did
[01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:10.420]  Obama pay for your mortgage and did he pay for your gas absolutely not mortgage
[01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:15.060]  got worse and gas has got prices got higher during that time we needed a
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:19.220]  change what a change for the better not for the worse he had a very big voice
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:24.340]  just like the Wizard of Oz the wizard with this little teeny teeny tiny man
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.700]  and I think it's the same thing with Obama man behind the curtain not who we
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:36.660]  thought or expected him to be I was Dorothy the Wizard of Oz that's how I
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:42.220]  feel I was Dorothy I started getting more educated about politics and reading
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:48.340]  more what I learned is never trust the wizard it's within ourselves to have the
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:54.660]  the determination the courage and the brains to bring us to our destiny is
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:36:01.180]  America still a land of opportunity 100% it is anything that you want to do or
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:12.180]  become you can do it in America no place like utopia is the new film and if it
[01:36:12.180 --> 01:36:16.540]  sells out in the first few cities it opens in it'll get picked up nationwide
[01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:23.260]  like America 2016 and others have done it was great to go to the movies last week
[01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:27.780]  and be able to have multiple choices at major theaters to go see America well
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:31.500]  and which you know is not perfect but certainly you know it has some good
[01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:37.260]  aspects to it it's like cyanide to these tyrants but but Joel Gilbert's film is
[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:41.500]  gonna be even more powerful there's no place like utopia and it's now being
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:45.540]  released first in Denver so he joins us here and I have no financial stake in the
[01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:50.500]  film though when it comes out on DVD I intend to carry it at m4store.com I try
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:56.100]  to promote the Veritas project and other people I mean we're just in this
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:37:01.420]  together they're trying to they have arrested James O'Keefe before that they
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:05.140]  have arrested Dinesh to Susan I've got all sorts of dirty tricks going against
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:09.020]  me right now which only lets us know we're gonna fight that much harder we're
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:14.780]  never exploded faster it's because we're effective and because we're starting to
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:18.780]  set the real agenda to get us out of this mess that they're coming after so
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:22.460]  that's why we got Joel Gilbert on he of course made dreams of my real father
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:29.980]  that I believe overwhelmingly puts on a stunning stunningly convincing case that
[01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:34.660]  would convince a jury of who Obama's father really was and he isn't from
[01:37:34.660 --> 01:37:42.180]  Kenya folks he isn't from Kenya he looks just like the man who he would stay
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:45.820]  with in the summers then his grandfather hung out with him was best buddies
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:51.740]  with who was a famous communist in pornography and there's photos of him
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:57.300]  and a woman that is the spitting image of Obama's wife I mean Obama's mother and
[01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:00.420]  I'm not gonna go back through that we saw that film brings my real father at
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:06.060]  m4store.com and then you know why it Harvard Law Review he said he was from
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:12.060]  Kenya and why in his book review perspective he said he was from Kenya and
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:15.660]  why his wife in multiple speeches said he was from Kenya and why they did that
[01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:18.700]  whole thing putting out a bad birth certificate that was such an obvious
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:25.340]  fake they did all of that as an elaborate that's exactly how the CIA
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:30.380]  operates to act like oh no you found me out and then cover this up when really
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:35.100]  it's because we know who his real daddy was unbelievable and I want to get an
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:41.580]  update on that but Joel Gilbert net Joel Gilbert is here with us today Joel I
[01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:45.780]  want to talk some about the film because it couldn't be more timely tell us where
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.380]  it's opening and break down the film for us I can't wait to see it I've only
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:54.220]  seen excerpts and then expanding on that I want to talk about the waterfront
[01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:57.780]  with you because you're a smart guy I've had your finger on the pulse it looks
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:02.460]  like the progressive tyrants that the totalitarians who aren't liberal in my
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:05.860]  view I mean Thomas Jefferson was a liberal that's my saying as he was
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:09.780]  that's a liberal these people are not liberals you could call kind of George
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:13.340]  Washington a conservative and you would call Thomas Jefferson a liberal of that
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:18.300]  age that's how they were seen at the time totally different labels now but I
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.740]  don't believe I know they're going for broke right now and you can see on
[01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:26.340]  every front so I want you to speak to that okay well first of all they're not
[01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:31.620]  liberal about anything except sex drugs and other people's money other than that
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:37.140]  they're the most intolerant people that you could ever meet my film does open
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:41.340]  Denver there's no place like utopia and it's kind of a play on the Wizard of Oz
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:46.860]  Dorothy there's no place like home the idea of a socialist utopia paradise on
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:52.380]  earth is what binds together the ideology of Marxism and communism and
[01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:57.220]  progressivism they say everything is step by step toward this perfect future
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:00.900]  but we know in history and we show this in the film there's no place like
[01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:06.180]  utopia that every time a tyrant said I'm the god on earth Mal Stalin Lenin
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:10.820]  Castro follow me down this yellow brick road and I'm gonna take you to Paradise
[01:40:10.820 --> 01:40:16.180]  well when they got to the Emerald City when they got to Paradise Castro Lenin
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:23.540]  Mao sent them to the dungeons of gulags collective farms where they starved them
[01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:27.660]  to death and killed them trying to force them to fit into this perfect
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:34.260]  utopia utopians murdered 100 million people in peace time in the 20th century
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:39.780]  to force humanity into their socialist paradise unfortunately I show this in my
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:45.780]  film what we're seeing today is a repeat of this god on earth Obama is going to
[01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:50.700]  be the leader and take everybody down this path down the yellow brick road we
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:55.020]  know what's happened in the last 30 years and I go over this in the film the
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:00.060]  Democrat Party has been taken over by the radical socialists Obama's friends
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:04.820]  like Bill Ayers in the late 60s they said things like let's destroy America
[01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:09.540]  let's replace the Constitution with the communist manifesto now that failed
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:13.900]  because it was evil nobody wanted to do that those guys ended up going to jail
[01:41:13.900 --> 01:41:17.780]  for murdering policemen and went underground when they came out in the
[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:21.900]  early 80s they realized let's just change our rhetoric instead of saying we
[01:41:21.900 --> 01:41:26.060]  want to destroy America let's just say we want to help middle-class families
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.100]  let's say we want to raise the minimum wage so these radicals took over the
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:36.300]  Democrat Party and today the Democrat Party is a radical socialist party their
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:40.980]  agenda is the same they just have different rhetoric and a different face
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:46.460]  which is Barack Obama who seems like a friendly guy but as you alluded to in my
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:51.500]  last film he's really a red diaper baby he's the child of a communist party
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:56.140]  member and he was radicalized in his youth and spent his entire life journey
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.380]  in this little known world of American Marxism and today he's in the White
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:05.300]  House agitating just like he did in Chicago he was a professional agitator
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.680]  they used the word organizer because it sounds nicer but he was a community
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.980]  agitator the ideology is let's rub salt in the wounds of minorities and use
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:20.580]  their discontent to take power and then discard them then he was to the White
[01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:25.700]  House where he's continuing to agitate I met all these people I go to Chicago
[01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:30.780]  Southside Chicago Detroit Denver Newark and I talked to these people that have
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:35.100]  been living in these progressive cities for 50 60 years and it turns out they
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:40.900]  realize nobody is progressing they're all regressing 60% unemployment drug
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:45.540]  culture violence schools are closed so what's happening is they're bringing
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:49.140]  these failed policies that they destroyed our great cities with to
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:53.300]  Washington so they can impose it on the rest of the country and then there's no
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:58.220]  place like utopia I put the whole story together so you can understand what the
[01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.700]  Obama of Oz is really up to and where the ideology comes from and by the way
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:07.220]  Joel I never got it completed and then now it's an old film so I'm making a
[01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:12.220]  whole new one Obama deception too is basically the film you're making I'm
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:15.220]  glad yours got out and it's not that I knew what you were doing or you knew
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:19.120]  what I was doing it's the truth we're sitting there looking at it and a
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.620]  there's this globalist ideology above it but it it's clearly using classic
[01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:30.420]  communist tactics down the line and now that we see Obama in collapsing the
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:33.500]  border shutting down the power plants I mean I make a big deal out of that because
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.860]  it's already doubled energy prices in six years for electricity I mean this is
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:40.460]  crippling people if they hadn't done that alone we wouldn't be in this
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:45.580]  depression and and and so your film from what you're saying is so spot-on your
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:52.460]  last film was so powerful we need everyone to which sites should they go
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.260]  to don't learn about times and listings and and how do folks make sure they can
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:44:00.300]  get this shown in their city okay well first you can see the trailer and other
[01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:05.500]  information at there's no place like utopia.com and we have a theaters link
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:09.780]  that you can click on and you can say please bring there's no place like
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.660]  utopia to my city and when we expand we send those out all over the country to
[01:44:14.660 --> 01:44:18.500]  the theater owners and that helps quite a bit but we're opening in Denver this
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.060]  weekend five times a day I'm gonna be there and you can buy advance tickets on
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:27.540]  Fandango if you know anybody in Denver tell them to cancel their plans this
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:31.940]  weekend and please come out because if we do well this weekend we're gonna go
[01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:37.060]  nationwide and reveal the entire lie of progressivism in a way that everybody
[01:44:37.060 --> 01:44:41.140]  can understand it's also a call it humorous and horrifying because the movie
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:46.220]  is a lot of fun it rocks with music but it shows and reveals oh yeah the trailer
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:50.140]  the trailer is incredible and again I'll use a cheesy Star Wars analogy here we
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:53.860]  got 30 X-wings going into the trench here and a lot of films have been made
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:59.020]  but we don't know which photon torpedo is gonna go down the shaft and blow it up
[01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:03.260]  I've got a feeling about this film it could be the one that that just like
[01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.420]  Uncle Tom's cabin or the jungle change things societally resistance is
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:12.620]  victory because we don't know which punch which uppercut is gonna land and
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:16.900]  break the jaw and we've already landed a lot of blows you know in the fight
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:21.340]  getting the truth out but we've got to hammer them and hammer them hard because
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:26.380]  I got to be honest I'm rarely wrong about things Joel I know the globalist
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:29.700]  didn't know how they're rich and powerful and enjoy wealth and I just kind of
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:34.500]  thought of communism as some old bygone era failed thing I mean I knew a lot of
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:37.780]  financial interest like Armand Hammer and George Soros and people had funded
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:41.660]  it and used it to control populations of countries they're not in but to
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:46.740]  imagine that the elite in this country would actually put a communist in that
[01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:50.100]  they would actually try to create a race war that they would actually do all
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:55.900]  this with such a classic Soviet destabilization handbook you know the
[01:45:55.900 --> 01:45:59.900]  program that General Parton talked about I used to think oh General Parton's
[01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.140]  being a funny daddy you know former head of Air Force weapons development
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:08.300]  Major General and it turns out we are actually facing like you said at the
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:12.300]  grassroots it's a radical socialist party but they're actually communists at
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:15.820]  the top and they really do plan to use Homeland Security on Patriots they
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:20.660]  really plan to round us up like Larry Grafwald exposed with a weatherman I
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:27.220]  mean they're that savage and I mean how do we stop them I guess your film and
[01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:32.060]  shows like this well in the early 60s they used to Hollywood John Wayne
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:37.900]  Ronald Reagan all made commercials and movies explaining you see these radicals
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:43.780]  on campus who are worshiping Chairman Mao like Bill Ayers he was a Maoist let's
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:50.300]  tell you who Mao really is he is a psychopathic communist who locked 50
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:55.340]  million people in collective farms were 50 million people starved to death and
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:47:00.020]  they explained that there is no God on earth there is no paradise on earth the
[01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:05.620]  closest we have to paradise is Kansas this is as good as it gets whenever in
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:10.180]  history somebody says I got the perfect formula for social change we're gonna
[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:15.820]  change everything follow me whenever you hear that you have to ask yourself what
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:21.180]  stripes are my uniform going to be this time exactly you're going to prison the
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:26.420]  end game of socialism is prison camp because they cannot force people to fit
[01:47:26.420 --> 01:47:31.340]  into their paradise unless they kill about half of them they killed a hundred
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:36.140]  million people in peacetime all over the 20th century more than that more than
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:41.900]  that but the political repression the ideology of creating a look a big lower
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:45.980]  class and eliminating the middle class so the political elites can control the
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:50.900]  wealth is the ideology of Barack Obama and it is the ideology of the Democrat
[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:54.540]  Party today and America is the perfect place for this to happen because we've
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:58.980]  never had something this big I mean we didn't go through with the Chinese and
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.620]  the Russians and the Cubans everybody have gone through we have no idea what
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:07.860]  we're facing well I mean I didn't I didn't have an idea it and people think
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:11.700]  I'm radical and you know think things are worse they are no no no I've been
[01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:16.500]  blindsided by how real this is how much they hate this country how much they
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:20.940]  hate freedom how nasty they are I mean they run the country they took over why
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:28.020]  do they want a racket their their twisted ideology still is that they're
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:33.420]  comparing America to a socialist utopia to a paradise on earth not to other
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:38.540]  countries so when they compare America to utopia of course they hated everything's
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:42.780]  wrong if you compare America to the rest of the world this is paradise on earth
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:48.620]  but these this ideology is born of the Marxism the communism the idea of
[01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:52.340]  creating going down the yellow brick road and this magical wizard will solve
[01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:57.220]  your problems we know and you saw Peggy Joseph in my movie she also found out
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:02.460]  Obama's just a man behind the curtain and their agenda is certainly to break
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:06.540]  down and destroy the American middle class and everything they do is meant to
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:11.580]  divide and agitate us and not bring us together and it really is I mean they
[01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:16.540]  really are passing seven taxes and Obamacare on poor people and he sits
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:20.540]  there holding their hand and being sweet to them while they know full well they
[01:49:20.540 --> 01:49:26.140]  want to wreck them I mean it is just so vicious and when I stand in a newbies
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:30.500]  cafeteria line and I see old ladies I mean there since I was a kid who can't
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:35.860]  afford a Luan platter now that's where King of the Hills you know Hank Hill's
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:40.260]  wife's name comes from by the way folks a little inside stuff from Mike judge or
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:46.340]  niece you know Luan oh I mean I stand on those lines now and nobody can afford

[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.820]  these progressives love it why do they love it Joel Gilbert they love it
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:59.900]  because they need chaos in order to justify radical change if everything is
[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:03.860]  going well if you can do like Michelle Obama and you can go from South Side
[01:50:03.860 --> 01:50:07.740]  Chicago and go to Princeton and go to Harvard and get a law degree and get a
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:11.620]  job making three hundred thousand dollars a year like Michelle Obama there's no
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:16.260]  reason for radical change everything's fine but they have to tell you that you've
[01:50:16.260 --> 01:50:20.100]  lost control and lose control the border that's why in my film I show Michelle
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:25.860]  Obama saying you can't buy food you can't pay your mortgage you can't take
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:30.500]  care of your kids not in America they have to create chaos and make you think
[01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:35.740]  that life is out of control to justify giving them the power that's the evil
[01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:38.460]  ideology and then they screw it up more and then they say give us more power
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:42.620]  then they screw it up more give us more power until we're under Stalin or
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:47.020]  Mao and they're building the camps and everything and you see it's all just

[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:01.420]  strobe Talbot blames Russia for shooting down commercial airliner Malaysian
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:06.060]  passenger airliner shot down the Russian border in Ukraine Obama attacks
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:09.420]  second amendment with a new executive order we'll tell you about that US Army
[01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:13.940]  training to fight black Americans that's in these drills we have the video of and
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:18.660]  admitted it's nothing but black people what's the plan I guess in Chicago to
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.940]  turn the welfare checks off and then Obama saves the day I don't know but
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:27.460]  they're creating the destabilization to then offer the solution taking over the
[01:55:27.460 --> 01:55:31.380]  border and their solution is total legalization which will only cause an
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:35.820]  even bigger collapse and we documented they're shipping the illegals in on
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:39.300]  buses and deploying them they first denied that a month ago now it's
[01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:44.500]  confirmed in closing Joel Gilbert how do you think it's going for Obama and the
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:49.140]  progressives I see as a 50-50 ballgame we're on a knife's edge it could go
[01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:53.660]  either way that's what we need maximum effort by everybody right now yeah from
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:57.500]  their point of view from Obama's point of view he's very successful he's
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:02.300]  agitating the country he's divided black and white he's divided rich and poor and
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.140]  he will try to feed off of this and the next administration and the Democrat
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:11.380]  Socialist to maintain to use the discontent to maintain a hold on power
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:16.580]  the character of America emanates from our declaration of independence and
[01:56:16.580 --> 01:56:21.300]  Bill of Rights these created this American identity of freedom free markets
[01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:26.940]  and free speech and limited government Obama is the last step of this vast
[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:33.100]  left-wing conspiracy to destroy all of these wonderful things that grew wealth
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:38.020]  and made people free not only in America but all over the world I think in my
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:43.620]  film it has a great chance if it goes nationwide to really expose the entire
[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:48.540]  ideology and sick agenda and that's why I'm asking everyone to go out and see it
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:53.260]  if you know people in Denver even if you don't buy some tickets on
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:58.180]  Fandango and help us sell it out because if we do we're gonna expose the
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:04.060]  entire ideology and the history such that once people realize what they're
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:08.660]  doing that it's not trying to help anybody it's trying to break apart the
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:14.260]  greatest country in the world and that's not rhetoric it's just I'm almost
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:18.740]  pinching myself every day and I'm dreaming that it's worse than we can
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:25.780]  describe how nasty nasty these people are well it's in their ideology Obama's
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:29.500]  mentor Bill Ayers authored a document that said they were gonna break up
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:34.460]  America into four regions have it occupied by North Vietnam North Korea
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:40.020]  Russia and China put 25 million Americans in reeducation 50 million and
[01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:45.260]  killed 25 million killed 25 million this is the guy that we think wrote Obama's
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:51.140]  book and was his mentor and Obama is the hood ornament on this evil ideology
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:56.100]  that was rejected by America but because they put a new face with a hidden
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:01.380]  agenda imagine if Obama had told the truth in 2008 my father was a Soviet
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:05.740]  agent and I grew up in the world of American Marxism I'm going to triple
[01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:09.820]  the deficit I'm gonna I'm gonna flood the country with the illegals I'm gonna
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.700]  have the most secret government in history and I'm gonna tax your health
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:18.300]  care now he said the opposite to get elected with a hidden agenda it's the
[01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.580]  biggest fraud and manipulation of free people in the history of the world it
[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:27.100]  is it is the way to fight back is I think education get through the media
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:31.980]  blackout and I think my film there's no place like utopia has a shot because
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:35.540]  it's gonna put it together absolutely great job Joel Gilbert we'll get the
[01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:40.100]  website out again later thank you so much stay with us folks 30 hour coming up
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:44.140]  it's an info war they want to shut down our speech for a reason we're hurting them

[01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:05.700]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:09.580]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:12.460]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:19.980]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:19.980 --> 02:00:39.340]  Alex Joe man I tell you stuff is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier
[02:00:39.340 --> 02:00:44.100]  scrub towel but the former editor of Newsweek was a time magazine who worked
[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:48.180]  for Clinton in the State Department who said that you know world government
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:51.860]  needs to replace the United States and that socialism needs to replace it you
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:57.340]  can read his quotes online he's right about it in the magazine he's come out
[02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:01.340]  and blamed Russia for shooting down the commercial airliner saying that one of
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:06.340]  the separatist leaders took credit without giving proof I always love us
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:14.220]  when he puts a tweet out yeah I mean to be like if I put an article out all he
[02:01:14.220 --> 02:01:21.460]  does is just put some text up there you know claiming that the separatist
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:24.660]  admit that they did it and was a mistake I'll guarantee you if the Russian
[02:01:24.660 --> 02:01:28.060]  separatist did that they wouldn't be telling you they did it that was a
[02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:35.420]  mistake I mean that is ridiculous and again if it comes out Russia did it then
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:39.180]  Russia will say that then I believe it but I mean I just don't believe anything
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:43.740]  out of George Soros and strobe Talbot what do you think I know that the
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:47.940]  comments on the website and the stuff I see on Twitter no one is buying this and
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:51.140]  it's the same make-and-model they're saying as the other Malaysian missing
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:54.940]  plane so is it like Northwood's I'm not saying as people are saying this where
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:57.060]  they talked about having one plane where everybody gets on with the same
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.300]  make-and-model and tell number and then they get off somewhere else and then
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:04.060]  later you blow up the other plane and that's why you've got to disappear the
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:06.900]  other plane because you really don't want to shoot down a bunch of innocent
[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:11.300]  people you just blow it up by remote control as a drone and say that somebody
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:22.660]  else did it and again that's ABC news Baltimore Sun April 2001 look up
[02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:27.980]  Operation Northwood's click web on the Google link and you will see articles
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:38.340]  from 2001 before 9-11 about a Pentagon plan to stage a shootdown of an airplane
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:44.020]  and replace it with another one and we know about Diego Garcia we know about
[02:02:44.020 --> 02:02:50.140]  the Indian Ocean we know about all of it and this plane has stunk from the
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:54.220]  beginning there's clearly been a cover-up the official story hasn't held and I
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:02:59.820]  just something smells bad out of all the planes that could get shot down it's
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:07.500]  this one I mean did they just fly a drone over there blow it up we know our
[02:03:07.500 --> 02:03:11.700]  government's got all sorts of deals with the Malaysian government in black ops
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:16.860]  this this really stinks ladies and gentlemen and before Time Magazine and
[02:03:16.860 --> 02:03:21.900]  Newsweek New York Times come out and say that I'm I'm I'm saying this I'm saying
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:26.180]  it's an official US government plan and that so we should look at it in fact they
[02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:29.980]  found the article there it is ABC News
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:38.660]  US military wanted to provoke war with Cuba May 1st 2001 I said April I think
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:42.700]  the original article was like April 31st but regardless and my members pretty
[02:03:42.700 --> 02:03:47.060]  good I was one day off in early night you know back then they would put stuff on
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:50.220]  the web the next day I think that's what that was here put it back up I matter
[02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:54.700]  the newscast is from April 31st but doesn't matter because there's the
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:58.180]  article see in the early 1960s America's top military leaders reportedly
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:01.620]  grabbed it plans to kill innocent people and command acts of terrorism in US
[02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:05.100]  cities for a public support for a war against Cuba code named Operation
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:09.500]  Northwoods the plans repeatedly included reportedly included the possible
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.580]  assassination of Cuban immigrants shinging boats on Cuban refugees on the
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:17.940]  high seas hijacking planes blowing up a US ship and even orchestrating violent
[02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:23.020]  terrorism in US cities yeah shooting up movie theaters plastic bombs at public
[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:28.700]  events plastic explosive plastic you can go read Northwoods it's like 12 pages
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:34.340]  long go read it and I'm telling you the globalists never do anything new they
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:39.660]  just repeat plans and they did a lot of stuff in Northwoods in Europe under
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:48.100]  gladio and under the NATO option so you know we ought to get Pachinicon I have

[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:58.900]  back

[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:54.660]  bombshell news and developments at prison planet com and info wars com and on my
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:09:02.700]  Twitter account at real Alex Jones is an understatement we have a Malaysian
[02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:10.620]  airliner 777 if you can believe it shot down 50 miles inside Ukraine over
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:19.620]  Crimea and within minutes of it happening a few hours ago the government
[02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:26.700]  of Ukraine was already blaming the Russians with no proof and then we now
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:33.060]  have strobe Talbot big globalists but signal presents key type sworn to
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.620]  world government sworn to socialism just search engine his name is his
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:42.620]  writings coming out and claiming that that someone you know on Twitter or
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:48.380]  whatever claiming to be some opposition person says they did it yeah I heard
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:53.140]  Alex said he did it too or again very suspicious that they're putting the
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:59.300]  narrative out right up front how did Dick Cheney want to start war back in
[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:04.380]  2007 with Iran Cy Hirsch got the documents talk to the officials they
[02:10:04.380 --> 02:10:09.860]  want to have Navy SEALs attack US ships in the straight of Hormuz but they said
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:15.660]  no and reportedly Bush said no pretty powerful stuff ladies and gentlemen
[02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:20.460]  Cy Hirsch has also said that the bin Laden death was fake and staged of course
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:23.980]  we said that very early on it was clear it was Navy SEALs families we've talked
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:27.180]  to say that the SEALs know it was fake that's why they killed almost everyone
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:35.500]  who was on the raid of the bin Laden lookalike just amazing I don't know the
[02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.660]  truth maybe the Russians did do it I mean it's a war zone Russia has said
[02:10:38.660 --> 02:10:41.740]  they're gonna counter strike but it wouldn't be blowing up some other
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:48.860]  countries airliner in broad daylight at 33,000 feet and then the big story US
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:54.940]  Army training to fight black Americans actual video up on info wars.com I shot
[02:10:54.940 --> 02:10:58.780]  a 20-minute overdrive almost 30 minutes special report last night that aired
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.580]  after the nightly news the news is always 30 minutes long but when it's
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:07.020]  extended when the main news ends some stations are already carrying not just a
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.380]  affiliate you know prison planet TV viewers we then go into for just online
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.460]  viewers an extra expanded overdrive and we did a very important break now of
[02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:25.020]  this it's regular Army training battling black people in the drills and I made a
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:28.100]  big deal about it when we saw some of this training a few years ago where it
[02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:32.460]  was only white people so they're just training to attack certain ethnic
[02:11:32.460 --> 02:11:36.420]  groups and again we're not demonizing the military even here they don't like
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:39.740]  what's going on they're freaking out Joe Biggs talks about it it's a very
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:46.820]  powerful breakdown we are large excerpts of it in the first hour today also the
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:50.540]  Israeli military denies targeting children swam for not having the
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:55.820]  courage to talk to Hamas that's how to zero hedge yeah Israel's making big
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:01.220]  mistakes when they kill five teenagers playing soccer on a coast at the beach
[02:12:01.220 --> 02:12:06.980]  and then you know basically don't don't say it was you know collateral damage it
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:11.460]  was a mistake that happens in war and I'm not excusing it but just saying hey
[02:12:11.460 --> 02:12:15.500]  we're under attack we're fighting back big deal that's that's that's loses
[02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:18.860]  moral high ground there and I just want peace over there folks I don't dislike
[02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:24.780]  the Israelis or the Palestinians or anybody but I'm fighting to keep my
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:30.620]  country free and it is just a tragedy to see what's happening but you know what
[02:12:30.620 --> 02:12:38.860]  I've got to say it's probably a 20 30 40 times bigger event with ISIS being
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:42.980]  run by NATO running around murdering Christians and non-radical Muslims all
[02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:46.980]  of the Middle East and our government is funding and running that and I don't
[02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:50.300]  know why all these trendies out there that want to scream about Israel all
[02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:55.500]  day and say that you know if you fall a banana peel Israel did it there's
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:13:00.700]  other stuff going on too I'm concerned about it all but there's this cause
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:07.620]  celeb thing with the left that's only about Palestinians or only about Israel
[02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.340]  you know the whole pro-Israel crowds very diverse group but you know if you
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:17.460]  don't agree with anything you know I mean everything they say you're an anti
[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:23.620]  Shemite I mean I'm just so sick of the whole thing aren't you sick of it don't
[02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:26.980]  you wish they could all just get along like Rodney King said but again it's
[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:31.460]  that Balkanization now for the balance of the hour I've been really wanting to
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:35.460]  get him on for a while he's been such a popular guest on the show dr. Peter

[02:15:57.140 --> 02:16:02.140]  more and more chronic illnesses what are some of the reasons we need to educate
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:05.820]  ourselves now there's about different ways to handle disease in the body why
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:11.140]  is this so what is the philosophy of MDs and why don't they believe the body can
[02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:16.180]  fix itself in many cases why are MDs taught that they are the only ones who
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:21.180]  can manage conditions because it's it's it's an imperial priesthood and it is
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:24.220]  run by the big drug companies folks we'll talk about big pharma how they're
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:28.420]  brainwashing us and more but also talk about the new book that I've read my

[02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:17.620]  always a pleasure to be here you're welcome you know like Benjamin Franklin
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:22.540]  said my cousin by the way Benjamin Franklin unless we hang together most
[02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:27.700]  assuredly we will hang alone. That's right absolutely we're going to break here
[02:17:27.700 --> 02:17:33.700]  in a few minutes but first off here today what are you planning to cover? Well
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:38.060]  everybody in this country is sick and we're not getting better we're getting
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:44.060]  worse our health is deteriorating every single solitary month things are
[02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:47.780]  getting worse the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States medical
[02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:52.540]  bills the leading cause of death MD directed medical treatments something is
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:58.980]  going on here and Dr. Wallach and I are the only ones talking about it the best
[02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:03.900]  place to hide something of course is in plain sight so I'm gonna pull back the
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:09.100]  curtains on what's going on here in the medical arena and really get into some
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:14.660]  very specific things people can do right now today to make a gigantic difference
[02:18:14.660 --> 02:18:19.380]  in their overall health because as God is my witness Alex people are suffering
[02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:24.540]  needlessly. Well you're not just saying that look at every metric they admit that
[02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:30.180]  hospitals the number one killer in the country now and then down the line the
[02:18:30.180 --> 02:18:35.980]  drugs the drug interactions all of it I know so many family members so many
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:40.020]  people that go into have minor surgery and are dead I mean just just just dead
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:44.820]  all around me death death death drug resistant stuff pouring across the
[02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:49.780]  borders wide open this is crazy town. It is crazy town and you know it's not the
[02:18:49.780 --> 02:18:53.660]  gun it's how it's used right well guess what it's not the drug it's how it's
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:58.140]  used I'm not against drugs I can prescribe drugs for goodness sake but
[02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:01.940]  there's a way to use pharmaceutical medicines which is effective and
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:06.060]  supportive and there's a way to use pharmaceutical medicines which is
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:11.420]  destructive and most people in the United States have no earthly idea that
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:15.980]  they're medical doctors I mean bless their hearts your MD may be the nicest
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:20.980]  person God ever created a humanitarian a really great person but they don't know
[02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:25.820]  what's best for you they only know what they've been trained in and what they've
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:29.980]  been trained in as it turns out is just one small piece of the pie of medical
[02:19:29.980 --> 02:19:36.540]  science and when people understand how MDs are trained to think about the
[02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:41.820]  relationship between the human body and disease everything will change when
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:46.780]  people understand how the MDs think and how they operate and you know quite
[02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:52.140]  frankly that there are in fact science-based clinically verified
[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:59.140]  alternatives to drugs and surgery. Stay there Dr. Glitton. This is powerful stuff coming up.
[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:04.380]  It's time for a home security quiz. What effective home security device is
[02:20:04.380 --> 02:20:07.940]  smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home

[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:08.820]  that free doctor book is all about because that sounds very interesting but
[02:25:08.820 --> 02:25:14.180]  again ladies and gentlemen it is very important to really consciously think
[02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:19.740]  about this each day that if we buy by increments because none of us are
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:24.340]  perfect really start trying to drink more water get healthy take the right

[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:05.420]  get into the big bombshell info well knowledge is power Alex I mean look
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:08.700]  around everybody's sick everybody's suffering everybody's getting worse
[02:26:08.700 --> 02:26:12.460]  everybody's taking prescription medications I mean you know I'm 56 I
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:16.620]  didn't know anybody when I was a kid that had Alzheimer's I didn't know anybody
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:21.220]  that had autism my Alzheimer's has risen from obscurity to the become the sixth
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:25.380]  leading cause of death one out of 89 children now were born autistic
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:29.540]  arthritis is skyrocketing high blood pressure medical doctors that went
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:33.140]  through in the 50s and 60s have said on this show that they would have to get on
[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:38.220]  airplanes to fly to see a child with cancer it was so rare now they're just
[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:42.540]  kids everywhere dying all around me and the reason that this is happening is
[02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:48.100]  not because of you know excessive radiation and pollution in the world
[02:26:48.100 --> 02:26:52.700]  there are factors that have to do with this but the reason that most people are
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:57.220]  sick and suffering is because we've taken the wrong dog to the hunt I mean for
[02:26:57.220 --> 02:27:00.980]  goodness sake if you had a heaven forbid if you had a bullet in your arm you
[02:27:00.980 --> 02:27:05.340]  would not go to a chiropractor to have that removed because that's not their
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:09.620]  wheelhouse it's not the wheelhouse of the chiropractor to do surgery right
[02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:16.140]  well as it turns out your MD is the wrong person to go to if you're suffering
[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:22.380]  with a chronic disease the wheelhouse of the MD is trauma care surgery when it's
[02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:26.900]  absolutely necessary and a handful of infectious diseases that's their wheel
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:31.540]  house that's what they excel in and in a perfect world it would be illegal for
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:36.620]  them to do anything else because when they bring their philosophy of medicine
[02:27:36.620 --> 02:27:42.340]  to bear on a human body with a chronic disease they miss the point completely
[02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:47.660]  and this is why we're sick and suffering because the MDs bless their hearts I
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:51.100]  mean I have a lot of friends who are MDs your father's an MD there's room in the
[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:56.620]  world for the MD but not when it comes to chronic disease for goodness sake
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:28:02.700]  we're dying at record rates I mean not even dying just suffering right can't
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:06.340]  even play 18 holes a golf anymore because people you know their knees can't
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:11.300]  handle it people can't fall asleep at night without a sedative chronic heart
[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:15.380]  burn chronic just low-grade stuff that's whittling away because they don't have
[02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:18.860]  the trace elements it's because they don't have the trace elements right well
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:24.380]  this is the thing the our position is that when it comes to chronic disease
[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:29.020]  there's education that people need to know and all chronic disease can be
[02:28:29.020 --> 02:28:34.460]  traced back to nutrient deficiencies especially minerals nutrient deficiencies
[02:28:34.460 --> 02:28:39.740]  especially minerals but the sad fact of the matter is it is impossible to get
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:44.580]  all of the body's nutrient needs met just by eating food you can't do it it's
[02:28:44.580 --> 02:28:51.020]  impossible so unless and until you are supplementing your diet with a good
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:56.740]  high-quality medical nutrition program it is only a matter of time until
[02:28:56.740 --> 02:29:01.300]  something you run out of something and then something breaks and then your
[02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:07.260]  only option because of Obamacare is to go to an MD who hasn't been trained in
[02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:12.460]  how to fix it they've just been trained in how to manage it and this is why
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:17.580]  everybody's dying that's one of the biggest factors I agree with you and
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:23.340]  it's scary that the US leads the world in breast cancer and diabetes I mean
[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:27.340]  we're not being negative here we're being very positive to admit the problems
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:30.780]  long 18-minute segment coming up I'm gonna try to give you the floor for most
[02:29:30.780 --> 02:29:36.300]  of it to really lay out some of the basic truths that are revolutionary and
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:39.500]  and then go to some of the breaking news I don't know about epigenetics I know
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:43.340]  you're really into that as well I find that to be so exciting and more and more
[02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:47.940]  mainline science is saying this is where it's at well they ride back with
[02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:53.980]  Dr. Peter Glidden we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:57.580]  GCN radio network
[02:29:59.780 --> 02:30:03.500]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:08.300]  family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine
[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:13.620]  deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so many of the
[02:30:13.620 --> 02:30:17.980]  body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being developed
[02:30:17.980 --> 02:30:23.260]  by Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your
[02:30:23.260 --> 02:30:27.260]  body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is
[02:30:27.260 --> 02:30:32.260]  powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the
[02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:37.580]  results that I personally have had have been life-changing nobody else has got
[02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:42.100]  iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen this is innovating
[02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:46.700]  and the best part is it helps fund info wars dot com the radio show the TV show
[02:30:46.700 --> 02:30:50.580]  the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas for a limited time
[02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:55.060]  experience the ancient power of survival shield x2 take advantage of this

[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:04.580]  like taste dirt in it God knows what's in there these people just sampled city of
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:08.740]  Boston tap water straight from the faucet next we had them try a sample of
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:13.660]  tap water filtered for the probe your g2.0 filtration system now when it is
[02:31:13.660 --> 02:31:17.380]  better tastes like nothing yep I know a good water tastes like it's good water

[02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:42.980]  store.com and I'm kind of plugging a lot of stuff this hour because I didn't
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:46.660]  really do it in the first two hours we sell high quality products promote high
[02:35:46.660 --> 02:35:51.780]  quality life-changing products liberty-promoting products here and then
[02:35:51.780 --> 02:35:55.060]  funder operation the good old-fashioned way we earn the money to do it it's a
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:58.620]  very expensive even living in Texas while we're located here because it's
[02:35:58.620 --> 02:36:01.060]  cheaper than other parts of the country we couldn't do this in New York or
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:05.180]  California or you know other really expensive areas and also it's getting
[02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:10.660]  more and more expensive but we run an operation that reaches 20 million people
[02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:14.980]  a week one way or another on all the different platforms and we do it for
[02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:18.780]  about eight million dollars a year and that sounds like a lot of money it's
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:24.580]  not when you talk about media okay I mean the local paper I was cost tens upon
[02:36:24.580 --> 02:36:30.940]  millions around a year and loses money and is one of the least unprofitable
[02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:33.700]  ones in the country that you know they talk about the statesman as a model of
[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:36.900]  success because some of its divisions make money I mean we reach
[02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:44.700]  conservatively I'm infowars.com on Alexa 20 30 40 times more than that paper does
[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:49.220]  and it's a paper that serves millions I mean that's just an example go look at
[02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:55.780]  the ratings online it's just the bang for the buck most talk show hosts would
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:59.140]  have a radio show as big of a mind they have about three employees a website that
[02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:03.140]  posted a few articles every day we have some t-shirts and mugs we sold and I
[02:37:03.140 --> 02:37:07.700]  would just have radio advertising and I would make all that money for myself and
[02:37:07.700 --> 02:37:13.860]  I would have a private jet and I have a giant mansion I'm not into that stuff I'm
[02:37:13.860 --> 02:37:18.220]  I mean I like a car you know Ford truck runs good got a charger as well I've had
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:24.180]  for six years I got two cars and I dress okay I mean you know but that's not my
[02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:28.780]  goal in life is not to just make money I want to have freedom I want to defeat
[02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:32.580]  the globalist so I've taken the money that a talk show host at this level would
[02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:37.020]  be making and I put it into expanding media operations and reporters and
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:42.220]  researchers and bigger servers and magazines and films and news websites
[02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:46.860]  and nightly news and by the grace of God it is really having a giant effect I
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:51.460]  want to find the lever that moves the world I want to affect fundamental
[02:37:51.460 --> 02:37:55.700]  change I want to really stop the globalist and the progressives and we're
[02:37:55.700 --> 02:38:00.300]  doing that thanks to you so pray for us support us support our local AM and FM

[02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:43.780]  new products out from young Jevity Immortallium and so many others which
[02:38:43.780 --> 02:38:48.420]  is breaking research I want to get into some of the stuff we're discovering
[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:55.500]  about DNA and more with Dr. Glidden who joins us right now Dr. Glidden you got
[02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:00.820]  the floor for the next 14 minutes or so break down the big picture for folks the
[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:07.980]  greatest well here's the big picture folks it is impossible for your body to
[02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:11.860]  optimize its structure and function without 90 essential nutrients there
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:18.300]  are 90 essential nutrients that your body needs 60 minerals 16 vitamins 12
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:23.620]  amino acids and two essential fatty acids the sad fact of the matter here
[02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:28.780]  however is that even if you owned a hundred acres of organic farmland and
[02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:33.460]  had the best organic food in the world and only ate your stuff you would still
[02:39:33.460 --> 02:39:36.820]  be deficient in nutrition and nutrients because the nutrients that your body
[02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:42.580]  needs are not present in the food they're not there they are not all there so
[02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:47.380]  unless you are supplementing with effective efficient absorbable
[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:51.980]  nutritional supplements appropriate for your body weight it's only a matter of
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:56.940]  time until something breaks now look the information that I've gleaned and that
[02:39:56.940 --> 02:40:02.660]  Dr. Wallach has gleaned from 20 30 40 years of clinical experiences licensed
[02:40:02.660 --> 02:40:08.180]  naturopathic physicians is unique and this information is so important for
[02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:13.180]  people to understand I'm giving it away I wrote a book Alex reference the MD
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:18.060]  Emperor has no clothes I'm giving it away when you get my book you will be
[02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:22.660]  able to understand what to do the simple steps you can take which young
[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:26.660]  Jevity nutritional supplements are best for you which nutritional supplements
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:30.700]  are best for you which foods are good which foods are bad because you're not
[02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:35.700]  taught this in school you're not taught it you know the best way to get out from
[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:40.660]  underneath the the death grip of the medical insurance companies and the
[02:40:40.660 --> 02:40:46.060]  pharmaceutical industry is to get your body so healthy that you don't need to
[02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:50.220]  use them unless of course you know you have some type of heaven forbid
[02:40:50.220 --> 02:40:55.180]  traumatic accident to the body so that's why I put this well website together
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:41:00.100]  free doctor book dot com just go there you'll get my book for free it's free
[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:05.220]  because you need knowledge for instance did you know that heartburn is
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:09.980]  associated with not enough calcium and not enough salt did you know that restless
[02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:14.100]  legs at night in bed is associated with not enough calcium not enough
[02:41:14.100 --> 02:41:19.180]  magnesium did you know that high blood pressure is associated with not enough
[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:24.980]  calcium and magnesium did you know that selenium supplementation selenium a
[02:41:24.980 --> 02:41:30.660]  simple mineral cheaper than dirt because it's made from dirt selenium
[02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:36.620]  supplementation at 200 micrograms a day which is a tiny amount reduces breast
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:43.540]  cancer occurrence by 82% it also reduces prostate cancer occurrence by
[02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:52.820]  69% colon cancer by 64% and lung cancer by 39% even if you're a smoker you know
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:57.500]  why don't the season Susan g Coleman women know this because they don't want
[02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:02.740]  you to know this it is not the medical industry's job to keep you healthy and
[02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:07.740]  as God is my witness thank God for Nova King thank God for the sterile technique
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:13.860]  in the mattress suture surgery is complicated healing is easy you've been
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:18.500]  duped by a hundred years of pharmaceutical propaganda making you
[02:42:18.500 --> 02:42:24.380]  believe that healing is a complicated sophisticated process it is not surgery is
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:29.100]  a complicated process and thank God for the surgeons who do it but healing is
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:34.340]  easy our fundamental position give your body the nutrients that it needs to fix
[02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:40.740]  itself stop eating food that's coming up the works get out of the way and let the
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:46.340]  healing begin you would not believe the things that I've seen people recover
[02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:50.140]  from with science-based clinically verified well I know I know I've seen
[02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:53.460]  people that don't know who they are get on beyond Tangy tangerine Ted Anderson's
[02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:57.940]  dad and then and then he got his memory back and so many old people that have
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:02.860]  skin falling off and then they don't eat any fruits or vegetables and they don't
[02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:08.380]  and and they've got scurvy I mean they won't even tell you in the hospital that
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:12.580]  they've ever had a case of scurvy in the United States even though it's rampant
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:17.420]  simple vitamin C deficiency simple vitamin C rickets the simple vitamin D
[02:43:17.420 --> 02:43:21.940]  deficiency right Dr. Wallach was giving a lecture a couple weeks ago in Los
[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:27.900]  Angeles 350 people were scheduled to attend 1100 showed up I mean they had to
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:32.700]  they had the fire marshal came and they had to move half of the crowd outside
[02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:37.860]  onto the lawn why is this because there were 400 people in a suburb of Los
[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:43.940]  Angeles who recovered from type 2 diabetes with medical nutrition and
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:50.500]  and that word spreads folks the stuff that you we need to know about the
[02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:55.220]  relationship between the human body and nutrition that that stuff that we need
[02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:59.580]  to know is so far outside of most people's reference ranges that man they
[02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:02.860]  didn't even know they didn't know that let me ask you this question because I
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:08.700]  hope Dell's Children's Center here in Austin over the winter got filled with
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:12.220]  children including little kids that I know personally from good families that
[02:44:12.220 --> 02:44:17.980]  eat organic food and they would all get a virus and get pancreatitis basically
[02:44:17.980 --> 02:44:23.100]  and then they would tell them no you're just type 1 diabetes is genetic they
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:29.580]  rage is two to five or six it was a pandemic and even the hospital was
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:33.340]  admitting no they get a virus then they get it but it's genetic well how do you
[02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:36.780]  get a virus that causes pancreatitis which I then went and talked to some
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:40.980]  medical doctors and they said no no it probably can be reversed a lot of the
[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:45.420]  time but we're just being told to just make them a diabetic for life say it's
[02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:51.900]  genetic and then I talked to all these parents I mean something weird is going
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:57.860]  on here because I mean here's an example they know that iodine is needed by the
[02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:01.900]  body and they used to make people put it in the salt till the 60s and then now
[02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:05.580]  the government puts all these bad halogens the bromide the bromides in
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:10.980]  the food which I finally got on real true nason iodine that we promote
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:18.140]  survival shields x2 one element in the last year has literally changed my life
[02:45:18.140 --> 02:45:23.980]  now that's an info wars live calm info wars health calm the beyond 10 year
[02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:29.100]  tangerine 2.0 it's got 90 things in it when the government's only saying you
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:33.420]  need a few and it's been life-changing for myself and so many people that's
[02:45:33.420 --> 02:45:37.620]  how I started doing more research but just specifically what's going on before
[02:45:37.620 --> 02:45:41.380]  we get into iodine briefly because I don't know what you're gonna say but I
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:45.220]  know I respect your view on a final wise why it's helped me so much and why they
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:48.580]  don't people to know about this but but what it do you have any word on the
[02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:52.420]  diabetes and what's happening there I mean it's epidemic there they're saying
[02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:57.420]  half the public by 2025 will have type 2 and then suddenly your viruses are
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:01.300]  causing kids to get type 1 well there's a lot of cognitive dissonance here right
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:04.900]  because if a disease is truly genetic it can't be modified I mean the color of
[02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:09.060]  your eyes is genetic your sex is genetic I mean you could go to Sweden for a
[02:46:09.060 --> 02:46:14.420]  sex change operation but you know you can't affect a genetic illness in any
[02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:19.900]  way shape or form so if you can modify the presentation of an illness like type
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:25.460]  2 diabetes or Alzheimer's with diet and lifestyle then by definition it's not
[02:46:25.460 --> 02:46:30.380]  genetic but because of lack of information here lack of education
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:37.460]  people just don't understand this 1957 Dr. Walter Mertz and MD published a
[02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:44.180]  study that proved that the mineral chromium was related to a deficiency in
[02:46:44.180 --> 02:46:49.340]  chromium was related to type 2 diabetes research after that showed another
[02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:55.140]  mineral vanadium necessary for proper blood sugar metabolism according to the
[02:46:55.140 --> 02:47:00.300]  United States Department of Agriculture over 90% of the soil in the United
[02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:05.700]  States is deficient in chromium exactly guess what you run out of chromium you
[02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:10.100]  develop type 2 diabetes you put chromium back into the body your body
[02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:15.260]  optimizes its structure its ability to process blood sugar and you know what
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:19.220]  it gets even worse Alex because according to the food and drug
[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:24.580]  administration the only thing that can cure disease is a drug so as a licensed
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:29.300]  physician if I had a hundred thousand patients with type 2 diabetes definitive
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:33.980]  diagnosis and they get on board a medical nutrition program no more type 2
[02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:38.900]  diabetes I would not be able to say that I cured it and if I was able to prove
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:44.060]  it that I cured it the pharmaceutical industry would make the nutritional
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:50.540]  supplement that I used a drug and this is a gigantic problem this is why we
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:54.100]  need to educate people about right that they can do there's I mean it's
[02:47:54.100 --> 02:47:57.700]  elementary they're saying healthy packs that'll change your life for goodness
[02:47:57.700 --> 02:48:02.740]  sake they're saying artificial stuff is the only thing that can help you that
[02:48:02.740 --> 02:48:06.660]  blocks the symptoms or or manipulate something else in your body that's
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:11.100]  correct and and I know people that are on different serotonin reuptake
[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:17.460]  inhibitors like paxil that has caused them to get cancer that has caused them
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:22.900]  to get the logo you wear your skin turns white and then the doctor tells them
[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:27.180]  no your paxil did this just I mean it's just so crazy but let me ask you
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:33.580]  specifically survival shield x2 that I developed you know doing research with
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:39.300]  Dr. Group me this is from the actual crystals and what it's done to me has
[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:42.460]  just been off the charts the energy the clarity all of it and I know you
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:48.300]  everybody's talking about how important this is but how is how is one thing like
[02:48:48.300 --> 02:48:54.740]  iodine what's your view on iodine well well iodine is an essential nutrient in
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:49:00.260]  the human body it's an essential nutrient and you know it without iodine
[02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:05.100]  certain metabolic functions cannot happen it's kind of like if your car
[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:09.340]  runs out of engine oil well guess what the engine's gonna seize up and that's
[02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:13.420]  not good well if your car runs out of brake fluid something else is gonna
[02:49:13.420 --> 02:49:17.460]  happen if the car runs out of air in the tires something else is gonna happen
[02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:22.780]  iodine is necessary for thyroid function specifically thyroid is one of the
[02:49:22.780 --> 02:49:29.700]  master glands in the body thyroid metabolism is associated with virtually
[02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:35.500]  every single solitary metabolic system in the body and if your thyroid is not
[02:49:35.500 --> 02:49:40.500]  functioning properly nothing's gonna be functioning properly and in order for
[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:45.540]  your thyroid to function properly guess what it needs iodine it also needs
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:51.420]  selenium selenium and iodine mandatory for proper thyroid function and guess
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.260]  what if your car runs out of oil the engine seizes well if your thyroid
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:50:02.380]  runs out of iodine your entire body seizes but until they put in the water
[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:07.700]  and the food the bad halogen that blocks even if you have it it can't get in
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:11.260]  there and so again that's one thing that's been life-changing for me and

[02:54:34.620 --> 02:54:40.460]  it on the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central and of course back tomorrow, Lord
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:48.580]  willing, live 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central with the daytime radio show slash TV. The articles
[02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:55.060]  up on infowars.com are again pretty amazing. All the different things that are unfolding
[02:54:55.060 --> 02:55:00.500]  and taking place right now. Brazen smugglers threatened journalists while operating in
[02:55:00.500 --> 02:55:07.780]  broad daylight. And we've got our reporters, the Don Salazar and others down there on the
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:13.940]  border right now investigating all of this. It is just wide open with their boats and
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:20.420]  the rest of it. Again, Pervert gets his kicks by dressing up as a TSA screener and groping
[02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:24.200]  women at San Francisco airport. Bickham's didn't even realize that it was a drunk man
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:29.740]  was an imposter. They've got a report out today that Rupert Murdoch, the deal of a lifetime
[02:55:29.740 --> 02:55:38.020]  goes big for Time Warner, looking at buying it. The exec dropped the bombshell over lunch.
[02:55:38.020 --> 02:55:42.180]  Also we've got other reports, the military could use brain scanners to predict enemy
[02:55:42.180 --> 02:55:50.660]  thoughts but they can't find out why diabetes is exploding. And now Al Qaeda magazine, Inspire
[02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:56.980]  suggests attack on U.S. Open. Yes, after being given all those Stinger missiles, I bet. And
[02:55:56.980 --> 02:56:02.220]  Edward Snowden says the NSA employees pass around nude photos of people they're spying
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:07.900]  on. Yeah, that's come out before. Dr. Peter Glidden, in closing on the time we have here
[02:56:07.900 --> 02:56:15.380]  today, it really is incredible what proper nutrition can do. And as you said, even if
[02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:19.460]  you're eating organic, almost all of it is in soils that have been depleted because
[02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:23.940]  we're not using potash and things anymore. And it's really so simple. It's a huge piece
[02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:29.980]  of the puzzle and the word is spreading about it. And I think as things get worse and worse,
[02:56:29.980 --> 02:56:36.180]  it's going to force people to go out and do the research that it takes to begin to get
[02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:40.300]  out of this mainline medical model, especially as MD Healthcare, which has got a lot of good
[02:56:40.300 --> 02:56:46.900]  people in it, goes eugenics, where now the doctors have no say and it's all pre-programmed
[02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:51.180]  by the federal computers. I mean, that's why so many medical doctors up to a third of them
[02:56:51.180 --> 02:56:56.860]  are quitting right now, including my dad is because he's a doctor of oral surgery and
[02:56:56.860 --> 02:57:00.860]  of dental medicine. And for the folks don't know that's in the MD category. But across
[02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:07.620]  the board, they're leaving in an exodus because a bad system is being wrecked even worse.
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:11.660]  Things are bad, Alex, all over, but we have solutions that have been developed and delivered
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:17.460]  by licensed physicians trained in medical nutrition. Dr. Wallach's done all the heavy
