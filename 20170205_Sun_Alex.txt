[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  It's Super Bowl 51, we're going to be telling you who the winner is before we get to it.
[00:29.000 --> 00:41.000]  We're going to get into this federal court trying to block Trump and a lot more key transmission, several guests as well.
[00:41.000 --> 01:05.000]  But first, another riveting, piercing report from John Baum.
[01:05.000 --> 01:27.000]  This looks like political violence designed to squelch opinions that perpetrators of that violence disagree with. Am I reading it correctly?
[01:27.000 --> 01:41.000]  That's exactly what it is. The most particularly scary and particularly troubling is not only having an American college campus, you know, supposedly in the land of the free, you know, these places where you should be able to engage with different ideas, places where you should be able to hear speakers.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  And students who come to my talks who don't necessarily agree with me but just want to hear the other side.
[01:45.000 --> 02:01.000]  I want to talk to people who claim they're asking for the Second Amendment and claim their sovereignty and all the rest of it, who still can't admit they were wrong about Trump and come up to me on the street or, you know, in emails I get or comments I still on YouTube.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  Oh yeah, Alex, what about Goldman Sachs?
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  This is a whole cabinet full of rich guys and gals who I'm sure have lots of favors in there.
[02:10.000 --> 02:19.000]  As long as Trump goes out and actually gets people that know how to guide him through the globalist wilderness, like Lewis and Clark.
[02:19.000 --> 02:25.000]  And as long as it's our anti-New World Order, pro-America, pro-human agenda, they get done. I'm all for it.
[02:25.000 --> 02:32.000]  I made the analogy of I don't care if he has a goblin guide that leads him into the minds of Moria, as long as, you know, I don't catch him kissing goblins.
[02:32.000 --> 02:40.000]  At the age of 22, after graduating from Yale, I got a job at Goldman Sachs where I spent the next 17 years.
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  I started on a folding chair in the mortgage department.
[02:44.000 --> 02:54.000]  Nine years later, after many sleepless nights, I was put in charge of mortgages, U.S. government bonds, municipal securities.
[02:54.000 --> 03:03.000]  Several years after that, I worked directly for future secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, as the firm's chief information officer.
[03:03.000 --> 03:09.000]  In that role, I oversaw 5,000 people in a $1 billion budget.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  And we haven't seen that happen, have we? No, he's got the goblins under his control, and they're doing exactly what he says,
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  and clicking their heels when he gives orders, and then running off the little gleaming eyes into the night to do his work.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  That's true genius.
[03:24.000 --> 03:35.000]  Of course, he brought in top architects from inside the enemy operation to help know where to place the plastic explosives for the control demo that we're now witnessing.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  And his guides have taken him through the inner workings of it.
[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  He already had a good understanding as an outsider billionaire who was able to defeat their monopolies himself.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  Because Trump is all about one man doing it his way, defeating them.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  And he sees us as him.
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  And our victories and our successes is his.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  Look at him getting on a helicopter, not telling the press where he's going.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.000]  I love it. I relish it.
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  Going out to Fort Mead to pick up the remains of the Navy SEAL that died,
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.000]  battling the Al-Qaeda globalist forces that John McCain and Hillary and all the rest up and turned loose to the Middle East and into Africa.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  How presidential is that personally meeting the family?
[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  And there's optimism and the globalists are trying to kill that optimism.
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  And now he's over delivering at breakneck speed as they say in a session.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  Because his will, his name, his family, his honor, his treasure is bound to America and the planet succeeding.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  And that's what it is when you believe in humanity.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  It's exhausting, but it's exhilarating and it's empowering.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  All these inbred elites were given their power hereditarily, third, fourth, fifth, sixth generation.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  So they don't understand that and they just look down on everybody and want to make everybody poor so they can manage them and control them.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  With Trump, he's fully in.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  He has merged his essence with the Republic and restoring things.
[04:56.000 --> 05:25.000]  And so that's why Trump will not betray you.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  The terrorist was shot five times in the stomach and is currently in critical condition.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  He was also said to have paint bombs and a backpack he was carrying.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Another man was arrested at the scene, but it's not yet known if he is linked to the attack.
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  A spokesman for the French Interior Ministry said the identity and nationality of the suspects are unknown.
[05:42.000 --> 05:49.000]  A building in Paris was raided by police in connection with the attack, which has been labeled terrorist in nature by the French prime minister.
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.000]  Donald Trump tweeted about the attack, urging Americans to get smart.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  That's right. We don't want the terror that's descended upon Europe to make its way here.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  The President of France, FranÃ§ois Hollande, praised security for the quick response.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  I bet you did. They may have saved lives, but I doubt they saved your job.
[06:05.000 --> 06:31.000]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  This is an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[06:35.000 --> 06:46.000]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[06:46.000 --> 07:02.000]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[07:07.000 --> 07:23.000]  From the floodlines of the Infowars, it's Alex Jones.
[07:23.000 --> 07:42.000]  So there's Donald Trump saying, unify everybody, race, religion, creed, under America and freedom and prosperity, and you have the leftist all over mainstream news, including CNN hosts saying, poor white people, when it shows them being pulled out of their cars and beaten, just because they're white,
[07:42.000 --> 07:55.000]  and when they won't let speakers speak at Berkeley and women are beaten and men are beaten and cars are burned up, the media, including the dean of the school and the lawmakers in California say, this is good.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  We're going to get violent.
[07:58.000 --> 08:14.000]  Robert De Niro goes on the view and says, I want to punch Donald Trump in the face because he's a bully and you got to fight bullies like a bully. No, Donald Trump's not a bully. The globalists have completely bullied this country into submission and now we're standing up.
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.000]  More than 100 nations have travel bans on countries.
[08:18.000 --> 08:24.000]  Japan has travel bans on the very Muslim countries and more that Trump put in.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Because they know people coming in unvetted from Somalia are very, very dangerous.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  Somalia is not a failed civilization, it was never a civilization.
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  Hundreds of major publications every week are calling for Donald Trump's murder.
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.000]  Republican and Democrat appointed judges that are globalist controlled are trying to block him, simply saying, we can have borders.
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  You know, another federal court just as high said that what Trump's doing is under the Constitution under law.
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  But that got ignored in the night circuit out of San Francisco said, we didn't get the information in Trump's brief.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  So it's overturned until we get more info it's on hold.
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  But the public doesn't know about law, do they just hear, oh, the horrible, horrible Trump.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  Even though he's just enforcing an Obama law.
[09:18.000 --> 09:26.000]  This is the bureaucracy, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, the whole world, Hollywood.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  Everybody ganged up against America and Donald Trump.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  But something's happening.
[09:32.000 --> 09:40.000]  As Trump starts to bring jobs back, as Trump moves to cut taxes, as Trump moves to get banks to make small business loans, something that hadn't been done in 10 years.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  There's been a consolidation on purpose to make you poor by both parties. It's an admitted plan, as that happens.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  The grassroots of every color who are all the same race, humanity.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  All bleed red blood are waking up and the poll numbers show him going straight up.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  He was at 41 before the election with skewed numbers. Now he's up at 60.
[10:01.000 --> 10:07.000]  And they're panicking because those are even polls targeting key demographics they believe will show low numbers for Trump.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  His real numbers are above 70 right now. Remember, I told you that during the election and it was true.
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Because there are internal polls you can get.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  But when you go to major pollsters now, they're so controlled, they will not give you a public poll.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  It's under contract that you can set the parameters of that are actually fair.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  And the demographics you want pulled that are fair, they have their methodology.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  So the fix was in and that's now come out. I told you the fix was in with polls.
[10:34.000 --> 10:46.000]  So the fix was in, but even in their cooked polls, he's 19 points up in Rasmussen and Pew and Gallup and so many others.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  This is very exciting. That's the real news. So much to cover today.
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  First, let's go to another powerful John Bowne report that's up on infowars.com.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  We have more poll watching reports as well. We're going to be premiering.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  This is National Security Endangered by Soros Motivated Judge.
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  Again, Soros and the EU want total open borders. Germany's taken 3 million quote migrants, 80% military aged men.
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.000]  They're only taking more and more and more and more and they're murdering, killing, stabbing.
[11:17.000 --> 11:23.000]  And when Germans criticize that they get arrested, it's a total takeover plan to bring in third world populations.
[11:23.000 --> 11:28.000]  The central banks control and they make it look bad to want to stop that flow.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  A country can't decide who can come in and who can't.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  You want to get into Australia, you've got to jump through a bunch of hoops and have a bunch of money and improve that you're coming there with skills.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  You've got to have a couple million dollars and major skills they want to get into Switzerland.
[11:43.000 --> 11:54.000]  But other countries, France turns back. I've been flying into England before to cover Bilderberg and watch Canadian citizens that are supposedly part of the realm,
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.000]  the Commonwealth turned back because they're activists in front of my eyeballs.
[11:59.000 --> 12:09.000]  No criminal record. But again, they play on the haters. Oh my God, he wanted to stop these portal sweeties from Sudan that's waging war against the Christians of the south.
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.000]  It's in a civil war. Oh, we're not taking people unvetted from a civil war zone.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  But when you fly as a citizen, you get asked questions.
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  No questions, folks. They're not allowed to turn you back with fake ID.
[12:25.000 --> 12:32.000]  That's what Obama did. We take these refugees under a UN program and they decide who comes in. Let's go to John Bounds report.
[12:32.000 --> 12:46.000]  Seattle Washington federal judge James Robart based his judgment of the Trump administration's decision to follow through with a travel ban of seven Muslim countries as not rationally based.
[12:46.000 --> 12:54.000]  However, this purported logical judge was quoted by CNBC as stating Black Lives Matter.
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.000]  In August of 2016, Breitbart reported that the Black Lives Matter movement was funded by the U.S. National Security Public Enemy Number One, George Soros.
[13:05.000 --> 13:17.000]  In a detailed 69-page Open Society report on the agenda of an Open Society U.S. programs board meeting held in New York October 1st to October 2nd, 2015,
[13:17.000 --> 13:23.000]  a portion of the Soros-funded agenda read recognizing the need for strategic assistance.
[13:23.000 --> 13:37.000]  The U.S. programs board approved 650,000 in Opportunities Fund support to invest in technical assistance and support for the groups at the core of the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement.
[13:37.000 --> 13:47.000]  Furthermore, Soros' shaping of Black Lives Matter was used to alter the 2016 elections, oddly never mentioned by the Democrats,
[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  and their zeal to vaguely and solely blame the Russians as a hacked Open Society document stated,
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  Leaders of Black Lives Matter and the movement for Black Lives worked to influence candidate platforms during the 2016 primary season.
[14:02.000 --> 14:15.000]  This came alongside the recent acknowledgement by political strategists that African-American voters may be much more pivotal to the 2016 general election than previously forecasted.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  President Trump responded to Judge Robart in a tweet stating,
[14:19.000 --> 14:29.000]  What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into the U.S.?
[14:29.000 --> 14:38.000]  I don't work over in the United States. I work overseas and I'm currently in Iraq, which is one of the countries that run the list.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  And there's been a lot of discussion about the executive order. Obviously, in the United States, there's a lot going on.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  And over here, there's a lot going on as well. Just a lot of things you all don't see.
[14:50.000 --> 14:58.000]  My simple question was, as an American, if I went out in town right now, would I be welcome?
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  And they instantly said, absolutely not. You would not be welcome.
[15:02.000 --> 15:17.000]  And I said, okay, so what would happen if I went out in town? And they said the locals would snatch me up and kill me within an hour.
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  I'd be tortured first and after they were done torturing me, I'd probably be beheaded.
[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  It would go on video for everybody to see as an example.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  And so I already knew this was going to happen, but I wanted to hear it from them.
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.000]  And the point of it is, the point I'm trying to make is, this is the local populace that would do this.
[15:42.000 --> 15:50.000]  This isn't ISIS. This isn't Al Qaeda. This isn't the PMU. This isn't a militia from the Iranians or anything like that.
[15:50.000 --> 15:56.000]  This is the local populace that would do this. My question to them was pretty simple then after that.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  If you would do this to me in your country, why would I let you in my country?
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Because all this means to me is that-
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  That's right. We'll be back. Full reports on infowars.com. Stay with us. Massive coverage coming up.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  You developed Living Defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[16:23.000 --> 16:31.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  These are all parasites.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got something back in because I'm going back on it today.
[16:53.000 --> 16:55.000]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[17:04.000 --> 17:33.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[17:34.000 --> 18:00.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:00.000 --> 18:07.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:30.000 --> 18:56.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:56.000 --> 19:08.000]  Thank you so much.
[19:26.000 --> 19:51.000]  Thank you so much.
[19:51.000 --> 20:12.000]  Thank you so much.
[20:12.000 --> 20:22.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.000 --> 20:35.000]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[20:35.000 --> 20:45.000]  So you have a temporary ban for 90 days on people coming in from seven nations out of almost 200 countries who were unvetted.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  Something previous presidents have done or similar things they've done.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  And the media hypes it that it's going to cause the stock market to go down.
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  So the stock market had gained $1,200 plus billion. It's now lost a little bit of $100 billion.
[21:02.000 --> 21:08.000]  But the media is saying, see, the economy is going down. It's all over. Yay.
[21:08.000 --> 21:15.000]  Isn't that wonderful? But what they're not telling you is it's central banks around the world are now starting to raise interest rates.
[21:15.000 --> 21:20.000]  They came out when Trump got elected and they said, okay, we're just going to raise interest rates.
[21:20.000 --> 21:30.000]  That'll kill this nationalistic movement in the UK and the United States and Germany and Austria and Australia and areas of Italy.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  It's just all over. Spain, you name it.
[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  So the globalists for almost 10 years, 9 years, have been giving themselves 0% interest,
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.000]  not to mention bank or bailouts that are just trillions of dollars to themselves, that taxpayers have to back up.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  So they plunged the economy, then we have to back up their bad debts and then they turn around and take the money.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  We've loaned them and loaned it back to us at incredible interest.
[21:54.000 --> 22:03.000]  And so the first thing Trump did when he got in, just 16 days ago, he's only had like 10 working days, but he's been working all 16.
[22:03.000 --> 22:09.000]  The first thing he did was to come in and say, let's start moving with banking regulations.
[22:09.000 --> 22:17.000]  Let me get my Treasury Secretary in there. They have totally blocked all the money being given to small businesses and the individuals.
[22:17.000 --> 22:24.000]  Lending has just been shut off ever since the interest went to zero because why should the banks do that? They're the first handlers of the money.
[22:24.000 --> 22:27.000]  So they get it at zero, but only select megabanks.
[22:27.000 --> 22:39.000]  Trump said, no sir, we're going to give 0% interest to the little banks, the local banks, the regional banks, the private banks, the banks that aren't part of the insider groups.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  Not just the six big ones, not just a bunch of foreign banks.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.000]  We're going to give 0%.
[22:48.000 --> 22:59.000]  And Trump's pressuring the Federal Reserve right now that is a consortium of private banks, but as an intergovernmental meeting group, it's just kind of the counsel of the private banks.
[22:59.000 --> 23:04.000]  He's pressuring them to keep it low. Not that's even good overall, generally.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  We need some interest, so people that save and invest make money.
[23:09.000 --> 23:19.000]  But while America and the world is in this long depression slash recession for the average person, it's time for Main Street to get a bubble.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  Because when Main Street gets a bubble, you actually get a bridge built. You actually get a business built. You actually get some jobs.
[23:25.000 --> 23:34.000]  You actually get some money saved. You actually get some cars bought, some restaurants visited, some haircuts paid for, some new clothes, a new coat, some new shoes.
[23:34.000 --> 23:46.000]  Yes, these are dangerous bubbles, but they already created a mega bubble nobody can get out of unless we get the average person out of the bubble, because that's where you are able to rebuild an economy.
[23:46.000 --> 23:51.000]  But without getting some money to those people, it's not going to happen. This is 101 economics.
[23:51.000 --> 23:58.000]  Trump should be a superstar, loved by the general public or the average poor person.
[23:58.000 --> 24:08.000]  But the average poor person is a Democratic supporter, especially on the east and west coast, and they just really think all their prosperity comes from the government.
[24:08.000 --> 24:17.000]  They don't even care the stock market stuff because they don't own stock. They don't understand that those businesses are hiring a lot of times based off how their stock's doing.
[24:17.000 --> 24:25.000]  So there's danger in the Trump euphoria. There's danger in a bubble. There's danger in him betting on he can supercharge things, but here's the deal.
[24:25.000 --> 24:34.000]  The danger of not doing it is a guaranteed ongoing worldwide recession slash depression that's meant to consolidate total control and pick winners and losers.
[24:34.000 --> 24:44.000]  So I've been hammering on this for nine years, having economists after economists on. You've heard Ron Paul, big pessimist for every politician. He says, quote, a week ago,
[24:44.000 --> 24:56.000]  Donald Trump's doing a great job on the economy. I think it's too little too late, but he's doing a fantastic. He pulled the club up a fantastic job.
[24:56.000 --> 25:11.000]  Paul is one of the least complimenting people out there. Okay. He's very, very not mechanical, but he's just very, very dedicated to just being very, very machine like.
[25:11.000 --> 25:20.000]  There's the headline exclusive. Ron Paul says Trump is trying to stop global collapse. Folks, it's because he is. Listen, listen, I'm a smart guy.
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  I'm going to be okay during a global collapse. Okay. So many people are self-centered, though. They're like, well, I don't care, you know, if the general public, you know, gets hurt in this.
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  And of course, I'll get hurt as well.
[25:32.000 --> 25:43.000]  But what's really going to hurt me is seeing my fellow Americans and others really going bankrupt, being on the street or living 10 people to a small house and not getting enough food.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  And I've seen this played out this globalist program over and over again in other countries. They have an admitted blueprint.
[25:50.000 --> 26:07.000]  In 2002, Joseph Sticklets, who'd won the Nobel Prize twice, wants for economics, left the World Bank as our chief economist, and he said, I will not be part of the criminal activity taking place and trying to make the public poor.
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  Magically, thousands of pages got leaked right after he quit. He says it isn't him. He's put on the show seven or eight times.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  He says it's not him, but regardless, somebody leaked it. And you got to go read them.
[26:20.000 --> 26:28.000]  Greg Powell's got the documents, published it to the BBC's credit back there. The BBC's almost completely worthless now. They did some good even back then, 2002.
[26:28.000 --> 26:37.000]  And it was the plan of the IMF and World Bank, again, international meeting houses of megabanks. They're just the front groups, governmental name.
[26:37.000 --> 26:52.000]  It's the International Federal Reserve, basically, deciding to implode now the first world and make us debt slaves, kill the engines of production, the engines of liberty, the engines of upper mobility, and have a giant consolidation for political control.
[26:52.000 --> 27:04.000]  And even the liberal, Sticklets, he's a big liberal. I disagree with him on lots of issues. He still had a soul and cared about poor people and working people, the middle class.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  I mean, we don't want just a bunch of billionaires and trillionaire globalists that then rule on, like, mountaintops that are all high tech and have electricity.
[27:12.000 --> 27:19.000]  We're down here, like, it's just Chichestu's Romania or Venezuela and don't have electricity most of the time and have kids starving in the streets.
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  But that's the management tool of the globalist. That's what we're headed into.
[27:25.000 --> 27:42.000]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump, and by the way, a major federal judge at the same level as the other judge came out in a ruling, and Trump pointed this out in his weekly address yesterday, and ruled for Trump and said,
[27:42.000 --> 27:53.000]  absolutely, the President has the right to block certain countries, certainly for short periods of time, and Congress has the right to pass laws, and there are laws on the books, and gave this big ruling.
[27:53.000 --> 28:01.000]  And then the Ninth Circuit doesn't look at his ruling, looks at another judge's ruling. It's a big Soros guy pointed by George W. Bush.
[28:01.000 --> 28:08.000]  They're like, oh, look, he's appointed by George W. Oh, a Republican. The Republicans are our biggest problem.
[28:08.000 --> 28:25.000]  I mean, use your heads, ladies and gentlemen, and says, oh, no proof was given in the White House filing to us because the circuit judge that they picked, other circuit judges, not just one ruled for Trump,
[28:25.000 --> 28:40.000]  the circuit judge, they then cherry pick, gives his briefing, Trump puts his in, they go, oh, not enough information when they already had and under law are supposed to look at other comparable rulings by the same level of judges that was already on record.
[28:40.000 --> 28:50.000]  And Trump's brief mentioned that, but they just ignored it and said the President doesn't have the power to control who comes to the border.
[28:50.000 --> 29:03.000]  Obama opened the borders up completely and let all those people coming out of Latin America in places with TB and syphilis and everything else you can imagine.
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  The plague has been coming in leprosy.
[29:08.000 --> 29:21.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children. The artificial particulates, the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[29:21.000 --> 29:30.000]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa pure breeze.
[29:30.000 --> 29:45.000]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  The general public doesn't.
[29:47.000 --> 30:02.000]  The Alexa pure breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[30:02.000 --> 30:09.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarstore.com.
[30:09.000 --> 30:20.000]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given info wars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[30:20.000 --> 30:34.000]  Basically what we're bringing to the info wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor. It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market.

[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it. A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[30:51.000 --> 30:56.000]  I mean it's unbelievable, it's a quarter inch thick, it's got a 20 year warranty, it's waterproof, you can wear it, it's comfortable.
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.

[32:09.000 --> 32:19.000]  We're selling a product DNA force that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[32:19.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[32:24.000 --> 32:30.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[32:30.000 --> 32:34.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[32:36.000 --> 32:40.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:40.000 --> 32:43.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  It works like an antioxidant.
[32:45.000 --> 32:48.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  It's in powder form.

[33:19.000 --> 33:34.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[33:34.000 --> 33:45.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:45.000 --> 33:50.000]  All of them doing open satanic rituals.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.500]  It's part of the spirit cooking, part of the Aleister Crowley events at Podesta and other
[33:57.500 --> 33:59.020]  menions in New York.
[33:59.020 --> 34:02.100]  The high priestess admits these are real rituals she's doing.
[34:02.100 --> 34:07.000]  Old lady Gaga loves to go to those.
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  She's going to be ruling over everyone on top of the stadium.
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.160]  On top the stadium reportedly in Houston where we've got Owen shroyer and the rest of our crew
[34:14.960 --> 34:17.760]  Down there reporting. He'll be popping in towards the end of the next hour
[34:18.320 --> 34:20.320]  Roger stones popping in with a lot of new developments
[34:21.280 --> 34:27.920]  Inside the trump administration, but a lot of people are gonna ask me. Hey, why are you even here on sunday when the super bowl's on?
[34:28.480 --> 34:30.960]  I could care less about the Atlanta
[34:32.160 --> 34:34.160]  What are they the Atlanta what?
[34:34.240 --> 34:36.160]  seriously, I'm having
[34:36.160 --> 34:37.600]  Falcons
[34:37.600 --> 34:39.520]  the Falcons
[34:39.520 --> 34:46.400]  And the new england patriots because I know this has all been built up and designed so that men put their normal male energies
[34:46.960 --> 34:50.240]  Into watching a bunch of other overpaid spoiled rotten men
[34:50.880 --> 34:52.880]  Involved themselves in what is proto?
[34:53.760 --> 34:55.760]  virtual reality
[34:55.840 --> 34:57.840]  sports is the original
[34:58.560 --> 35:00.560]  simulation
[35:00.560 --> 35:07.200]  Of business and family and war and life sports is mainly war type competition carried out
[35:07.200 --> 35:09.200]  It's like my cat
[35:09.440 --> 35:11.440]  Grab a fake
[35:12.160 --> 35:17.840]  Mouse on the end of a string and I drag it along and the cat chases it the cat loves doing it because it has instincts to do it
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  But it's not a real mouse
[35:21.120 --> 35:23.120]  By the way, my daughter's seen a mouse
[35:23.600 --> 35:29.120]  In the kitchen. I've never seen it and the guys the other day my cat walks up with the little mouse little gray mouse in its mouth
[35:29.120 --> 35:33.520]  Kind of sad, but the problem is he actually got a real mouse this time. She's got a toy on the end of a stick
[35:33.520 --> 35:39.440]  It's like a mouse. He'll chase it around crazy for hours. He'll chase laser pointers. You name it
[35:41.360 --> 35:43.200]  So will the dog
[35:43.200 --> 35:44.720]  But see I'm not a dog
[35:44.720 --> 35:49.120]  I'm not a cat and what all of this is the same thing. You're like, well, so what let them have fun
[35:49.440 --> 35:50.480]  I get it
[35:50.480 --> 35:52.800]  Sports are great for your kids to be in or for you to be in
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.360]  Or to go see your friends in it
[35:55.600 --> 35:57.600]  I'm not saying it's unhealthy overall
[35:57.600 --> 36:04.880]  It's that the way it's force fed and the messages they then couple to it all the anti-gun messages all the open border messages
[36:05.200 --> 36:07.200]  All the anti-trump messages
[36:07.360 --> 36:15.200]  All the feminist anti-family garbage all the green police outie commercials and then force feeding us the devil worshipper
[36:15.760 --> 36:18.560]  Lady gaga and all the weird rituals they conducted
[36:18.800 --> 36:24.640]  Oh, it's the big pageant of the super bowl and the players coming in through like a spaceship entrance
[36:24.640 --> 36:31.680]  With glowing walls all around them like this is the most magic thing in all the world
[36:32.240 --> 36:34.240]  Nothing is more important. Meanwhile
[36:35.760 --> 36:41.680]  We discovered three years ago via ice sources and it was later confirmed in the new york times of all places
[36:42.080 --> 36:44.080]  but we were down in mcowlin, texas
[36:45.440 --> 36:46.560]  And
[36:46.560 --> 36:50.080]  Our reporters have it on tape. They admit it. Yes. We're ordered to bring in illegals
[36:50.080 --> 36:56.560]  Only 17% are actually children. It's it's adults. They're from the middle east china latin america europe
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.240]  You name it and a lot of them have serious diseases and we're ordered to let them in
[37:01.520 --> 37:03.520]  And we'd air these videos
[37:03.680 --> 37:05.680]  of senior border patrol telling us this
[37:06.240 --> 37:11.040]  And they'd get a 500 000 views when when other videos we do get 10 million
[37:12.480 --> 37:15.120]  The most important stuff in the world was like, okay
[37:15.120 --> 37:22.480]  So what the president ignored federal law on how you're able to come through a port of entry with a proper passport proper visa
[37:22.880 --> 37:29.600]  Time to be here. What your purpose is check for, you know diseases check for vegetables, uh, you know things that are
[37:30.240 --> 37:32.240]  Diseases in the plants all of it
[37:34.000 --> 37:39.440]  Because you know if you get one little egg pack of a type of beetle into hawaii that's going to wipe it out same deal
[37:39.440 --> 37:43.440]  And they say no
[37:45.120 --> 37:50.080]  We don't care it doesn't matter then we get a president that says oh seven nations
[37:50.800 --> 37:52.800]  Obama's done four before four the same
[37:53.360 --> 37:55.360]  He also bombed him at the same time
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.880]  You're not vetted. You're not you don't have real passports. You're your governments have collapsed. We found you always fake passports
[38:01.440 --> 38:04.000]  Uh, we need to have extreme vetting actually know who you are
[38:04.000 --> 38:09.600]  And run you through a database biometrically and they said oh my gosh, you're the meanest racist in the world
[38:10.880 --> 38:12.480]  And you can't do it. You're horrible
[38:12.480 --> 38:17.920]  And so one federal judge said trump was right another federal judge even more senior said he was right file the brief
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  But then another judge said he was wrong
[38:20.800 --> 38:26.080]  And so the night circuit in san francisco the most globalist one out there almost all up appointed by democrats
[38:27.760 --> 38:29.760]  They come out and they say that's right trump
[38:29.760 --> 38:36.960]  We're not going to even look at what you're doing basically until you give us some other big filing
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.080]  And then even then if they refuse it, which they're sure to do
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.640]  It'll take five
[38:42.640 --> 38:49.120]  Of the supreme court justices to overwrite it and right now the supreme cuts courts four four scale make
[38:50.320 --> 38:55.520]  So the media can then take trump's perfect record of delivering and doing everything he said he would do
[38:55.520 --> 38:57.520]  Do
[38:57.760 --> 38:59.440]  Run around
[38:59.440 --> 39:00.880]  Get upset
[39:00.880 --> 39:02.640]  Say he's this horrible person
[39:02.640 --> 39:08.640]  Sell it like his agenda is fascist and evil and then start calling for his impeachment his murder all the rest of it
[39:09.440 --> 39:15.440]  When it's obama and hillary and john carrey that destabilized the middle east caused the huge flow of refugees
[39:15.840 --> 39:20.240]  And destabilized the whole place to try to help saudi arabia put all these jihadis in
[39:21.840 --> 39:23.840]  So while
[39:23.840 --> 39:28.560]  We're all busy here even debating what the media is doing understand
[39:30.960 --> 39:35.680]  Trump is doing his basic duty and even using laws that obama signed
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.880]  And cnn even ran articles going oh look at trump. He criticizes obama all day
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.120]  But he used an obama law to do this, you know, I thought obama's bad
[39:45.120 --> 39:54.080]  The point is of course he should use an existing law without having to pass another one and then sign an executive order on top of it
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.400]  But again, they're attacking saying it's illegal and bad and horrible, but then admitting on the other side of their mouth
[39:58.400 --> 40:00.400]  Oh, look, he's copying obama
[40:01.840 --> 40:08.080]  Meanwhile, you've got the washington post is the only liberal publication to ask how far can protest go
[40:08.400 --> 40:13.040]  Well, not when they're riots or you're trying to kill people are beating people are burning up people's cars
[40:13.040 --> 40:15.040]  Are trying to burn up larry king's car
[40:16.720 --> 40:18.240]  All because he's white
[40:18.240 --> 40:24.720]  How far can protesters go before the government steps in and that's because the washington post realizes the head of uc berkeley
[40:25.840 --> 40:27.840]  The legislatures come out and said hey
[40:29.360 --> 40:33.280]  Trump you better not cut our federal funding. We're going to continue to not let people have
[40:34.640 --> 40:40.640]  Events at universities if the mob of people say they can't we're bullies. We're thugs
[40:40.640 --> 40:43.520]  We're going to stop you mean i've got the news articles here where they're saying
[40:44.560 --> 40:52.400]  They had robert reich go on cnn friday and say that it was trump supporters that rioted at uc berkeley
[40:53.520 --> 40:59.520]  ms mbc i played the clip friday said that mylo was throwing firebombs
[41:01.840 --> 41:04.720]  Mylo the gay conservative activists had nothing
[41:04.720 --> 41:09.600]  Of any such they lie and they lie and they lie
[41:14.320 --> 41:20.240]  So let's go over some of the things they're now pushing against president trump because this is the grip of bullies
[41:20.480 --> 41:22.480]  This is the group of thugs
[41:22.960 --> 41:25.440]  These are the people trying to shut down our free speech
[41:25.520 --> 41:32.480]  Of course, I want to punch him in the face robert denaro slams donald trump again on the view and says when people are bullies
[41:32.480 --> 41:37.440]  You have to bully them back. So if I want to just walk up to robert denaro because I know he acts tough in movies
[41:37.520 --> 41:38.960]  And I break his nose
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.160]  That's him gonna do that
[41:40.160 --> 41:44.880]  But I walk right up and I punch him up under the nose and actually tear his nose completely off his face
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.360]  His old ugly nose his old his his old buzzard beak
[41:49.920 --> 41:51.920]  directly off his face, okay
[41:52.720 --> 41:54.720]  And he falls down and hits his head
[41:54.880 --> 42:00.080]  Is that okay because I said he was a bully because I dehumanized him by the way, I like robert denaro as an actor
[42:00.080 --> 42:06.480]  And I think he's right on vaccines. Hey, buddy. You got censored with the movie you tried to show about vaccine dangers
[42:06.880 --> 42:11.920]  Donald trump is putting robert kindy jr. You admire at the head of the commission to find out
[42:12.080 --> 42:14.080]  This is wounding millions of people a year
[42:14.640 --> 42:18.080]  Killing thousands and thousands the government knows it's been declassified
[42:18.880 --> 42:25.120]  Why don't you not get bullied by peer pressure and do the right thing denaro and actually find out how good donald trump is
[42:26.160 --> 42:28.160]  donald trump's reenacting glass steagle
[42:28.160 --> 42:33.120]  Something that everybody agrees you need except the globalist so banks can't run scams
[42:33.360 --> 42:37.520]  He's trying to get money back to poor people. He's trying to cut taxes on poor people. He's trying to
[42:39.120 --> 42:44.880]  Kill carbon taxes police the tpp totally illegal global government talk about checks and balances
[42:45.600 --> 42:49.120]  Our government had sold us out to without even having a vote trump just killed it
[42:50.080 --> 42:56.640]  But the media's saying he's in a lecture. He's ineffectual almost out of Freudian slip. He's intellectual. He's ineffectual. He's evil
[42:56.640 --> 43:00.560]  He's bad. He's our la la. It's the end of trump and then we come back all the articles
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.920]  Where they say kill him kill him kill him murder him kill him and so much more i'm alex schoen stay with us

[47:14.960 --> 47:16.960]  Go
[47:30.240 --> 47:34.960]  Live from the info wars.com studios, it's alex jones
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  So
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.960]  A lot of people ask me alex won't you just have fun on a sunday like this and go watch the super bowl you deserve to relax
[47:50.720 --> 47:55.600]  If it was a wholesome event and wasn't filled with anti-gun anti-family propaganda
[47:56.080 --> 48:00.880]  And wasn't used to divert men into systems of being ineffectual
[48:01.600 --> 48:03.600]  ineffective
[48:04.320 --> 48:07.840]  Then I would before it as a wholesome form of r&r like
[48:07.840 --> 48:13.840]  Like mountain climbing or hiking or swimming or playing in sports yourself, but the nfl
[48:14.880 --> 48:16.880]  And all this stuff is just
[48:18.480 --> 48:20.880]  A pointless idol to waste away your life
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.400]  And it's a joke and the globalists are laughing at you and then george
[48:26.880 --> 48:32.800]  Herbert walker the author of the world government program to get rid of our sovereignty the guy that was the head of the cia
[48:33.200 --> 48:35.200]  And the head us ambassador to china
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.640]  Who got the deal through to let giant china take over u.s?
[48:39.440 --> 48:41.440]  control of much of the planet
[48:42.480 --> 48:49.920]  To leverage out free societies and then lady gaga and the pope the globalist pope that most catholics are battling
[48:51.040 --> 48:56.720]  Who's openly calling for world government and badmouthing christianity in europe and calling for an islamic takeover
[48:58.480 --> 49:00.640]  He's gonna have some video at the super bowl
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.240]  Or like the super crapper
[49:04.240 --> 49:07.680]  Like the super bowl is like a porta potty that has a door on the bottom
[49:07.680 --> 49:10.400]  And you you climb into it when you watch it on television
[49:10.800 --> 49:18.000]  And then george herbert walker bush and the pope and lady gaga and madonna and a bunch of spoiled rotten roi'd head football players
[49:18.080 --> 49:20.080]  and a bunch of people all come and
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.120]  Get inside the porta potty and go to town on you
[49:25.120 --> 49:26.160]  Pope
[49:26.160 --> 49:32.640]  Prepares video message for fans attending super bowl. He says sports is healthy and brings us together and we should do it more
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.160]  Don't have culture. Don't have tribalism. Don't have family. Don't have values. Don't have a country
[49:38.400 --> 49:40.080]  Don't have nationalism
[49:40.080 --> 49:47.440]  Just go to the big corporate sports games with the big rituals and all the satanism and all the rest of cried
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.040]  And all the drunkenness that go to this clearly big giant evil event
[49:56.640 --> 49:58.640]  And now the pope is
[49:58.640 --> 50:06.000]  One more person that wants to use the porta potty on people. I mean, that's it. The super bowl is a big toilet
[50:07.200 --> 50:12.800]  And when you climb into the super bowl, you willingly go in there and open your mouth like a baby bird
[50:13.200 --> 50:17.600]  So pope frances can get over your mouth and squat and crap right in your mouth
[50:18.320 --> 50:22.000]  Now the reason I bring up pope frances in that I never would talk like that, but he's the pope
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.240]  He said a few months ago that if you believe in nationalism or support Donald Trump or question government lies
[50:28.880 --> 50:34.400]  That you quote are someone that takes sexual pleasure in eating feces
[50:37.120 --> 50:42.480]  Now it's thinking about that everything they say is the opposite of what it really is so when you listen to him
[50:43.600 --> 50:45.600]  You're spiritually
[50:47.120 --> 50:49.920]  Communing with that and by the way, if you're a new listener just type in
[50:49.920 --> 50:53.040]  Pope likens conspiracies
[50:53.840 --> 50:57.920]  To the sexual desire for feces people won't believe it. Let's put it on screen
[50:58.960 --> 51:04.560]  There it is pope frances compares fake news consumption to eating feces if you read the actual quote. It's conspiracies. It's
[51:05.920 --> 51:11.440]  It will the very same london guardian ran reports that he used blackmail the last pope of pedophilia inside the church
[51:11.440 --> 51:16.640]  Which we know is going on to get control and he isn't even a catholic, but is a jesuit communist
[51:16.640 --> 51:23.440]  See the Jesuits were designed to go in and take over non-christian countries. Well, why not just overthrow christianity itself?
[51:26.640 --> 51:33.280]  Hillary says she loves jeewittical thinking can we put that quote back up on screen earlier ineffectual
[51:34.640 --> 51:37.680]  The crew was asking is that a word I said no it's same as ineffective
[51:38.240 --> 51:44.640]  Ineffectual they're telling us trumps ineffectual. He's gotten more done than any president in 16 days
[51:44.640 --> 51:47.920]  He's gotten more done than any president in a year and it's all good
[51:47.920 --> 51:54.640]  It's all constitutional and of course the pack of criminals and both political parties and the foreign banks and all of them that think
[51:54.640 --> 51:56.640]  We're broken think they rule us
[51:57.520 --> 51:59.520]  Are freaking out because they know he's
[51:59.920 --> 52:05.120]  Affectual they know he's effective. They know he's getting it done the trump effect
[52:06.400 --> 52:12.080]  Not producing we'll put it back on screen not producing. This is ineffectual not producing any or the desired effect
[52:12.080 --> 52:17.520]  Lacking ability or quality to cope with a roller situation. Same message. He's a loser
[52:17.520 --> 52:23.120]  He doesn't know anything. Obama knows Obama was a community organizer and was giving everything forget some guy that made
[52:23.520 --> 52:27.840]  Hundreds of billions of dollars total for his companies. Just forget it. He's a loser
[52:28.400 --> 52:30.400]  And again, why am I so behind trump?
[52:31.040 --> 52:34.400]  Because right down the line. He's right on everything but torture
[52:35.200 --> 52:39.760]  And last week he said, you know what I've talked to general mattis and he's against it
[52:39.760 --> 52:42.560]  I've talked to general mattis and he's against it and now
[52:43.120 --> 52:45.120]  I'm against it
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.200]  And now
[52:49.200 --> 52:53.280]  He's even coming out and saying he's against general surveillance of the public as he learns more
[52:53.600 --> 52:59.200]  That's what scares them is trumps real smart and knows more than I do on most subjects, but as he gets informed
[53:00.400 --> 53:02.560]  He goes and checks it out and changes course
[53:03.440 --> 53:05.440]  In fact, he's not pigheaded
[53:05.440 --> 53:11.520]  When he knows you're lying to him and trying to intimidate him he comes off as pigheaded horseheaded a mule
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.280]  But anybody ever got anything done in history behave more like a jackass
[53:19.680 --> 53:23.600]  So what are they pushing what are they doing? Oh, of course, I want to punch him in the face
[53:23.600 --> 53:28.960]  Robert DeNiro slams Donald trump again on the view and says when people are bullies you have to bully them back
[53:28.960 --> 53:30.960]  Now the whole world's being bullied right now
[53:30.960 --> 53:34.160]  Leftist magazine shows trump and crosshairs says why not?
[53:34.720 --> 53:40.160]  Calls for basically killing him and then I've got a breakdown of the democrats this week having the former deputy head of the defense department
[53:40.400 --> 53:47.760]  Shop a coup at the pentagon imagine you show up with pentagon. I'm here. I used to run this place. I'm going to visit everybody about a coup
[53:48.720 --> 53:50.720]  wanting trump
[53:51.200 --> 53:53.200]  To come arrest her
[53:53.200 --> 53:58.960]  See that's why they're having people beat up women at all the rallies I saw in DC if I was there and saw in San Francisco last week
[53:58.960 --> 54:03.280]  and all over they target women they target on camera and and they
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.200]  They target trumps family and they and they target congresswomen who support trumps children and
[54:09.760 --> 54:13.520]  They're trying to get us into a physical fight so that if trump
[54:14.160 --> 54:18.880]  Rightfully has the FBI go after the former head of the defense department the deputy head
[54:19.120 --> 54:23.840]  It'll be look. She was just saying remove him and he had her arrested. See he's a tyrant
[54:23.840 --> 54:30.080]  I mean we just attacked a bunch of women and burned things and then if the police do anything it's trumps fashion. In fact
[54:31.040 --> 54:33.520]  The day after they attack people in at UCLA
[54:35.520 --> 54:37.520]  Or you see Berkeley
[54:37.760 --> 54:39.760]  I saw us today and it was like
[54:39.840 --> 54:43.840]  Trump dangerous for free speech some are calling for censoring it
[54:44.080 --> 54:47.600]  Berkeley it was like that nasty and then the next day it was on the news
[54:47.600 --> 54:56.160]  Some trump people were attacking women no they would show their people attacking women in black outfits and say we did it
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.160]  Just like they said when I was attacked that I was arrested and thrown out of the of the inauguration
[55:02.480 --> 55:04.480]  No such thing ever happened
[55:05.920 --> 55:10.400]  But they don't care because they're going after the audience they know is not informed
[55:10.400 --> 55:15.120]  Or the 12,000 tweets have called for trump assassination since the inauguration daily mail
[55:16.720 --> 55:21.680]  Rage of trump's uk critics astounding says lord carry says he doesn't really know what the real crimes are
[55:21.680 --> 55:26.320]  I love it. It's all these women at women's marches holding up images of women in burkas
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.840]  And then women we have this video on info wars all over the world saying I'm converting to Islam because they have such hatred of the west
[55:33.840 --> 55:41.200]  Yeah, wait till they dump acid on your face because you're caught showing your face in public the more liberal countries just make you wear a high jib
[55:44.640 --> 55:46.640]  In most of the Muslim countries
[55:47.280 --> 55:49.280]  You get your face burned off, but that's okay
[55:50.720 --> 55:56.080]  I'll find that video was on info wars of like it. I think the headline is feminist call for
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.720]  Women being beaten sharia law. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. I don't know if you've ever heard of it
[56:02.720 --> 56:04.720]  Beating sharia law. I mean it is just
[56:05.440 --> 56:08.880]  I think jaymson put it together. It is just it's just you're you're there
[56:09.280 --> 56:11.280]  Within going f you white male
[56:11.680 --> 56:13.920]  We love Islam. We love sharia law
[56:13.920 --> 56:19.840]  Then you learn a big sharia law woman ran for sorrows the whole dc march and you're like really
[56:20.640 --> 56:22.640]  really
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.840]  Rage of trump morgan freedman

[56:37.760 --> 56:40.800]  Trump comes out and his quote defended killer putin on national tv

[56:50.160 --> 56:51.520]  It's stupid

[59:56.480 --> 1:00:04.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:33.360]  All right roger stones coming up in the next segment, but i'll just make a point here
[1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.680]  I've been so busy producing
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:43.120]  Broadcast and actually going out and shooting the videos the live reports trying to manage the crew that
[1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:51.360]  I've not been the best at all the different platforms there are out there to make sure that our lives feeds and our in our podcast get out to folks
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:56.560]  We already dominate to a great extent the the internet
[1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:00.160]  not just, you know
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:02.480]  political news, but but
[1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:05.280]  info wars all put together is one of the biggest
[1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:08.240]  media outlets in the world
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.840]  But for me, it's not how big we are. It's how effective we are
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:16.560]  And an example is joe rogan has one of the top five podcasts in the world
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.080]  He's been doing it seven and a half years 90 million downloads a month 20 million on youtube. That's 110 million
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:25.520]  I was talking to him about it if you count all the derivative stuff
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:29.040]  200 million people
[1:01:29.040 --> 1:01:31.040]  watch or listen to
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:36.400]  The podcast now some people obviously don't see the whole thing, but 200 million people that's a lot. Okay
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:39.760]  Now info wars
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.760]  Basically does the same thing or more
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  But I don't care
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:51.680]  He's not about who has the biggest I went on joe's show and I talked to him yesterday and he said yes, it's now the biggest ever
[1:01:52.560 --> 1:01:56.880]  And he said he's been on iTunes for seven and a half eight years since they started
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:00.560]  He said it's never happened. They held it up for a day and a half and we're gonna censor it till there was a backlash
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.840]  And it's already shot up to the very top of the charts
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:11.440]  And of course, you know, there's hundreds of youtube versions of it with 1.9 million
[1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:16.560]  300,000 400,000 200,000 100. I mean right now there's more than 10 million views of it conservatively
[1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:19.360]  I just wouldn't look myself and that was just spending a few minutes to look it up
[1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:24.880]  On youtube there's so many versions of it that count of 10 million views up just an hour
[1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:28.720]  And I didn't spend that much time doing the research maybe 45 minutes
[1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:31.360]  But the point is is that I don't have time to do all this research
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:37.680]  I go on there. It's number one ever and he said top rock stars top movie stars everybody on
[1:02:38.080 --> 1:02:40.080]  Joseph movie star tv star
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:42.080]  um
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:44.880]  You know host the ufc
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:51.600]  One of the top 10 comedians of the country sometimes he gives me is 20,000 people to come here speak him speak alone
[1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:54.400]  He sells out the moody theater 5,000 every time he comes to austin
[1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:58.960]  He sells out four shows in a row at cap city comedy club that holds like 2000
[1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.080]  The point is he's a big big celebrity
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:05.360]  and
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:10.400]  I coming on the show is the biggest thing ever happened to it. The point is is that I'm sitting there talking to my crew
[1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:14.800]  We think about how itunes has blocked us having our own
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:21.040]  Podcasts video. They won't accept our videos on there. We've gone through the you know the process for years
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:24.480]  They just kicked right barred off. That was in the news and since we just take it
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:28.800]  Oh, you just kick us off because they will dominate it will be number one
[1:03:31.520 --> 1:03:34.640]  Just like we'll dominate everything else we do because we know what we're talking about
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:40.000]  And we'll defeat the globalist just like trump's dominating on every front and they want to censor him and shut him down
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And not let you hear what he really has to say or does
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:46.480]  So later i'm going to play his weekly address and we're going to play his speeches here
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.400]  We're going to focus on it because you know what I've looked at what he's doing
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:53.040]  and jesus christ
[1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.720]  My lord the savior
[1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:58.080]  Said you judge a tree by its fruits. He's got the biggest
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.960]  Juiciest fruits i've ever seen
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:03.280]  It's unbelievable
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:08.240]  You think I care about personality or trump coming on the show or telling me he likes what I do
[1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:11.600]  I could care less except he's the real deal. Then I do care
[1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:17.360]  You understand I tried to have them all I had the clinton's try to recruit me. I had bush try to recruit me
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:19.760]  I've had the biggest radio networks try to recruit me
[1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:23.040]  I was even put on
[1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:28.320]  All sorts of big stations and xm and then told now alex people are upset with what you're saying
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:32.480]  You want to be taking off xm and I said I never even had a big deal of that. I said, yeah, I can't stop month later
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:34.080]  I'm off
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:39.120]  Just like I've been fired off radio stations. I mean, you know, this is not about me. Okay. It's about the mission
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:41.520]  But i'm telling you
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.960]  I've won all the super bowl rings in the radio world
[1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:48.640]  Okay, you know this guy's looking for a fifth or sixth ring or whatever it is
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:53.440]  Be I I deserve 15 but I don't want the stinking rings. They're ridiculous
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:58.160]  The point is imagine winning every time every time being number one
[1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:02.640]  And I'm not just number one. Look at paul lachlan. He's dominating
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:07.760]  Does he get any attention? No because they have to ignore the real victors
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:10.960]  This is alex jones
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:16.640]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017
[1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:19.280]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:24.880]  I'm talking about the ppx solar generator system from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors
[1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:28.720]  The ppx is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful
[1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:34.080]  You can run some 110 appliances at your house like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling
[1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:39.600]  Plus you can take it with you to jumpstart cars trucks buses 18 wheelers heavy equipment even airplanes
[1:05:39.920 --> 1:05:45.040]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity allowing you to create your own private power grid
[1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:51.600]  Literally anywhere in the world perfect for cabins remote locations any time you need to get off the grid for a while
[1:05:51.600 --> 1:05:56.960]  Go to private power grid dot com to watch this thing in action. That's private power grid dot com
[1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:02.720]  Even better use coupon code private at checkout and get a second ppx energy unit for free
[1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:07.120]  Check it out at private power grid dot com. That's private power grid dot com
[1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:20.240]  We are transferring power from washington dc and giving it back to you the people
[1:06:21.760 --> 1:06:25.360]  Americanism not globalism will be our credo
[1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:30.640]  Yes, I have thought
[1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:38.080]  An awful lot about growing up the white house huge nationwide protests erupted once again on president
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:40.580]  Donald trump's second weekend in office
[1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:53.760]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice when america is united
[1:06:53.760 --> 1:07:00.160]  America is totally unstoppable Donald j. Trump is now president of the united states
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:08.960]  And most importantly, we will be protected by god from the front lines of the info
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  It's alex jones
[1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:21.280]  Oh my goodness poor white people, please almost stop
[1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:27.600]  The democratic party is such a race-mongering kkk style group now that
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:30.400]  You saw the new dnc chair
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:33.760]  Who's been nominated?
[1:07:33.760 --> 1:07:37.200]  She said i'm white, but I will keep white people down. I will shut them up
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:42.160]  I'll make sure you a people of color get the privilege. That is literal kkk talk
[1:07:43.120 --> 1:07:44.720]  Meanwhile trump
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:51.280]  But inverted is like we're going to come together now they can stop us and they run around saying he's racist all day
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:57.920]  Oh, the clinton sucked billions two billion. This is confirmed even the washington post admits it kept 96 plus percent of the money
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:01.840]  In hady we sent an aid mission there
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:07.280]  And the people of hady if you say the word clinton want to kill you
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:10.240]  It's all on info wars.com
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:15.280]  And so roger stone is really concerned about this because we've discovered what appears to be a clinton mold
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:19.200]  Inside the trump white house
[1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:26.080]  That wants to basically take control of an initiative out to hady and certify the new clinton vice roy or vice king
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:29.920]  Or or minion or puppet that's there, but I don't want to spend all our old 30 minutes
[1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:35.280]  We have a 25 minutes with roger stone on that. I want to just recap it the dr. Jerome coursey article from friday
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:39.280]  The interview with roger for the nightly news. That's all up on info wars.com
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:45.600]  But this is a big deal. I want to get into some of the other stuff. This this ruling, you know, in fact, let's hit that first
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:47.600]  roger we have
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:49.280]  We have this ruling
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.520]  And we have one federal judge at the same level saying you're citing history the law the executive order
[1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:58.320]  Of course the president can do this then you've got this other federal judge. This is george w. Bush minion
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:03.760]  This this this open borders guy the soros style guy saying no you can't and in the night circuit
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:06.080]  That's san francisco totally socialist saying
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:14.160]  We're gonna wait till you file more information. Well, it's known powers of presidents to do this. So they're trying to make law from the bench
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:22.240]  Preemptively even though they know he's about to get his supreme court justice is in and then you see the open calls in another 15 newspapers a day
[1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:25.280]  I mean, I mean more than that to kill trump
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:29.520]  This is clear insurrection and then you have the deputy head of the
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:32.800]  defense department under obama
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:40.560]  Shopping in major newspapers a coup d'etat. That's not free speech. This is open organized rebellion
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:44.960]  Against the elected president that the american people have because they're so desperate
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:46.960]  rogers
[1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:50.720]  No alice. I think you're you're absolutely right the resistance
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:54.480]  to the election of president trump continues the
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:58.240]  Many in the mainstream media and many in the government
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:04.640]  And tend to pull out the stops in an attempt to smear trump and remove him not enough
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:09.680]  This has abated. It's as if the election never really took happen. It's as if
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:16.320]  They're their challenge of the electoral college didn't fail. It's as if their recount
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:18.960]  wasn't essentially
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:25.600]  A worthless waste of time that ultimately increased the number of votes for donald trump
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:27.600]  Uh, so
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.120]  The biggest problem. I think right now alex is the
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.760]  infighting
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:35.760]  within the trump administration
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.960]  Uh, where I think some aides to the president
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.560]  Are disserving the president with their leaks
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:46.960]  Uh, you know nixon would be rolling in his grave now
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.360]  And and by the way, we know some of the names. We're trying to be nice here. We know about the dirty tricks behind the scenes
[1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:55.840]  Uh, I mean these people need to stop right now
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:05.200]  Well, this is a power game and uh, steve bannon is entirely focused on on policy matters
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:09.280]  Where he is sympatico with the president of the united states
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:11.200]  a
[1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:14.480]  Steve bannon is trump's brain story
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:17.200]  As planted by some
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:20.640]  Who are not friends of steve bannon?
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:26.160]  Is meant to hurt bannon's standing with the president
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:29.520]  Making it look as if bannon is taking credit
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:36.480]  For the president's accomplishment sure because the president has hinges into his will that is synced because they're both american guys
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.480]  It doesn't mean one or the other, you know
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:45.600]  Is is controlling the other and he picked him because he's so synced with him or sympatico as you said and so they're busy spending all their
[1:11:45.600 --> 1:11:49.680]  Time trying to run him out because they know he's the guy helping the president
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:53.120]  Uh, actually go vet and check and then put his agenda out
[1:11:53.280 --> 1:11:58.320]  Which we've already seen in beautiful lightning war fashion in the last 16 days
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.120]  That's exactly right. Uh, and you very clearly have now a rights pre-buss
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:07.920]  regular republican never trump
[1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:11.840]  faction which is of a larger faction because
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:13.840]  pre-buss has
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.840]  sway and authority over the hiring
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:18.400]  of the white house staff
[1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:22.320]  Uh, when the president gave him this authority he gave him quite a bit
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:26.160]  Now, uh, there is grumbling among many of the
[1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:28.880]  original trump people
[1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:32.160]  that a very very small number of trump supporters
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:35.600]  Seems to be, uh, serving on the white house staff
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:38.960]  Or even thus far in the administration
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:43.440]  So that is uh, that is a kind of a festering problem
[1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.680]  in fairness
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:48.560]  The president's only been in office for two weeks
[1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.440]  And it's a little early to say
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:54.880]  But I would point out to you alex that when
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.760]  Jim baker
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:04.800]  Who had managed george bush's campaign was hired by ronald reagan to be his white house chief of staff
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:09.440]  The first thing baker did to insulate himself from criticism
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:16.720]  Is to go out to a high level of high pardon me a large number of high level reagan
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:18.960]  alum from his
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:23.840]  Goomritorial days from his campaigns like lennon off-sigur and others
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.480]  and appoint them
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:32.240]  To visible positions in the administration. That's right. Let me let me set it in layman terms here
[1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:37.920]  Trump's super smart has great guts great instincts. I'm not second-guessing him. I marvel at what he's done
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:42.480]  But he's brought in a disproportionate amount of his hardcore never trump enemies
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:46.240]  And they're surrounding him and they're already doing weasley stuff
[1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:50.560]  They're already leaking and the republican establishment is already not backing him on this clear
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:59.440]  situation with protecting our sovereignty and from terrorist and so a trump is a corporate guy who's used to taking over a company and
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:03.360]  You know if he puts in the old leadership that was still doing a good job
[1:14:03.600 --> 1:14:06.160]  They're still going to be for him because now he's just the owner
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:08.160]  I think there may be some
[1:14:08.180 --> 1:14:14.880]  Instinctual blind spots here because I know he thinks he's he's going to co-opt them for our agenda by being nice to them
[1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:16.160]  And still letting them have power
[1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:21.760]  He doesn't understand that they join the globalists because they have a twist of evil a twist of cane
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:29.120]  And they've been promised even bigger things if they can kill the king and that this is kind of a let's stab julius caesar to death here
[1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.920]  Well, I happen to know for a fact that both the new york times
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:37.120]  And the washington post were granted access
[1:14:37.760 --> 1:14:39.760]  to rights previs
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:44.080]  kelly and conway and steve bandon on the record on friday
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:48.720]  And if you listen to all of them, we're one big happy family
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:53.120]  There are no tensions. There are no is no jockeying
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:57.120]  for white house positions or government positions
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:00.480]  And that is I understand
[1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:07.120]  what they're supposed to say as good soldiers and as I say those who have leaked to a disservice to the president
[1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:11.760]  So they're they're fighting is not in the open. They're fighting is
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:14.480]  Subterranean as it will as it were
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:16.960]  But it is really
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.960]  hurting the president
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:21.920]  Somebody leaked to the washington post last week that
[1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:25.760]  Trump was like a clueless child in a particular meeting
[1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.120]  These are people who work for trump
[1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:36.400]  It's also not true anybody who's met it. So sure and I mean let's just oh my gosh. Trump is so slick. It's unbelievable
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:39.600]  But but the point is I want to come back and talk about this
[1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:43.760]  We've got the bureaucrats and I I read this friday. I made some calls
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.480]  And so far I have three confirmed sources that the pentagon believes
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.120]  that this obama strike list
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:56.400]  That was given to trump the day he visited the cia that obama had the green light to strike
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:02.640]  He knew they were al-qaeda isaac spaces and said no don't hit them that they may have forwarded to the saudi arabians
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:06.400]  That strike list to set up our trips to set up trump

[1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:44.720]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:50.720]  You know i've admired ron paul and known him and been a friend i guess for
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:57.040]  20 years i've been interviewing him 21 years maybe friends the last 10
[1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:01.280]  But it's not the same as it is with trump
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:04.720]  Trump is so fire-breathing
[1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:06.320]  so
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:08.320]  energetic so
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:12.800]  cunning so real and he's having results so amazing
[1:21:13.360 --> 1:21:15.360]  that it just makes me
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:18.560]  Be endeared to trump i'm ready to die for trump at this point
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:23.920]  And i'm already ready to die for america. It's the same feeling i have for america because he is america. You're america
[1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:30.560]  It's the same way i get endeared to people i know that have fought hard and lost legs or arms for this country and just
[1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:35.600]  How hard-working and good they are now compared to the average person who's lazy and doesn't care
[1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:39.760]  I i i just i just feel humble to be around those type of people
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:43.360]  Because i study policy i'm a policy wonk
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:49.600]  And i know that trump and bannon really know what her what's happening. They're really trying to cut taxes
[1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:52.240]  They're really trying to get loans to small businesses
[1:21:52.400 --> 1:21:56.080]  They're really trying to get a side of carbon taxes and obama care and they're doing it
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:22:03.120]  They're delivering and it's so well thought out. It's so good. I studied history. I've covered politics for
[1:22:03.120 --> 1:22:05.840]  25 years 21 on air
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:08.720]  And i've never seen anything like this
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:13.520]  This is bigger than 1776 if trump can deliver and then i see all of the news
[1:22:13.920 --> 1:22:20.480]  I've got articles today. Ha ha there's tens of thousands of bureaucrats that are going to leak everything you're doing militarily and sabotage you
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:22.480]  That's called treason. That's
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:24.000]  executionable
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.040]  and then
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:26.880]  I saw that earlier in the week and then i
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:31.600]  Started seeing articles going well word is they leaked about that mission
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  And the list
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:35.840]  Because it was so effective and you know
[1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:41.040]  obama doesn't want al-qaeda and isis to get rolled up because hillary and saudi arabia and all them were behind them
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.640]  And then i made some phone calls one of the calls hadn't come back yet
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:51.360]  That i called others and they said yes, that's what's being looked at. They were ready for them when they got there
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:23:00.240]  And we know obama wouldn't green like these lists that the navy seals and special operations and the and the green berets and the delta force
[1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:02.240]  Wanted to go after
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:07.440]  So that's what happened and
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:13.840]  The cia came to trump and said there. Here's a list of a whole bunch of targets. We've had for six months
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:17.040]  obama won't hit him because it's his real command bases
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.200]  and
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:23.120]  Trump said well, let's have meetings about it. They said okay. They said hit them then that's what you're saying
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:28.320]  And then that now moles in those very groups have now leaked the end of the list
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:32.400]  So that when our forces show up to take out the worst terrorist in the world
[1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:35.600]  They're waiting for them
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:39.200]  Roger holds a little bit the next segment so you can finish up. We got about six seven minutes left here
[1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:45.280]  But this is just such treasonous garbage to realize. He's such a david versus goliath
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:50.000]  How could you not just be endeared by this? This is so epic
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.480]  Well because alex washington never changes
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.560]  Uh, and the same people who have been running things for 30 years
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.240]  Like the status quo the status quo works
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:06.080]  In fact, didn't they say bay of pigs was really to set up kennedy make him look bad
[1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:11.040]  Yeah, I mean look the cia has a track record. Uh, that is uh,
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:15.280]  Unenviable when it comes to tell truth telly. They lied about
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:17.680]  um, uh torsher and iraq
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:20.320]  They lied about vengazi
[1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:26.080]  They lied about iran contrao. They lied about vietnam. They lied about the kennedy assassination. That's what they do
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:28.320]  They lie
[1:24:28.320 --> 1:24:30.960]  Uh, and that's why brennan was so arrogant outgoing
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:35.840]  Is they're going to bay of pigs the president trying to protect the country because they're allied with the gd islamists
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:40.400]  Meanwhile, uh, alex the the previous
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:46.880]  Uh, co-option of uh of the trump, uh, uh campaign or the trump movement
[1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:53.440]  I predict will come next in a series of fights over high profile ambassadorships
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:56.320]  Now as you know, these ambassadorships
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:24:59.360]  Uh, have always had a political tin
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:04.400]  Almost every president has appointed a major donor of theirs
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:07.360]  To the class a embassies
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:12.000]  So for example nixon appointed walter annenberg
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:19.840]  Uh, a media executive a major donor to richard nixon to the court of st. james the british
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:22.560]  ambassadorship
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:25.760]  It was revealed this week in an incredible piece
[1:25:26.640 --> 1:25:28.640]  by pimo angela
[1:25:28.640 --> 1:25:32.320]  That friebus is pushing a man by the name of
[1:25:33.040 --> 1:25:35.280]  duke vuken of the third
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:37.680]  a
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.840]  Bush supporter a jeb bush supporter who only later comes to the
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:45.760]  fight
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:49.040]  In the general election gives trump 900 thousand dollars
[1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:55.440]  That 900 thousand dollars is reported on the federal election commission sites
[1:25:56.240 --> 1:26:00.880]  And very briefly on open secrets, but then suddenly disappears
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:08.400]  Uh, mr. Buchan has a long history of federal investigations in the regulatory area
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:11.840]  He has conflicts of interest pertaining to
[1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.560]  um his
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:16.640]  participation in federal contracts
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:19.200]  And last but not least
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.320]  Mr. Buchan's partner in a hedge fund business
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:29.120]  Is the is a high ranking official in the chinese communist party. Whoa
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:30.400]  Oh
[1:26:30.400 --> 1:26:36.000]  So here's the bottom line trump's counting on his his his captains to bring him good people. He's good
[1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:38.880]  But here's the second part of the story. I've seen him do this before correct me if i'm wrong
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:45.680]  They're gonna put bad people in get the money trump won't know and then burn him saying he broke his promises
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:49.600]  Remember gingrich saying don't worry. He's not gonna drain the swamp. Don't worry. He's gonna hire lobbyists
[1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:51.360]  He's in a lifetime ban on him
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:56.080]  So trump's trying to deliver, but they're gonna sabotage him get the money for it and then blame him
[1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:59.760]  Well, and the important thing to understand here is that mr.
[1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:03.920]  previous is interested in uh rewarding the party donors
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:09.200]  As opposed to rewarding the reagan donors and the trump donors
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.040]  Pardon me the trump donors. I misspoke. It's the same story though
[1:27:13.760 --> 1:27:15.760]  It really is quite sadly
[1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:18.560]  Also, alexa wanted to mention to you that
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:24.560]  For some reason despite the phenomenal launch of the making of the president 2016
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.080]  Our donald trump orchestrated in a revolution
[1:27:28.720 --> 1:27:33.600]  Uh, which is doing extremely well was number one on amazon this week in new releases
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:37.040]  barns and noble refuses to post
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:38.960]  any
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:40.960]  reviews of the book
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:42.640]  period
[1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:46.960]  By the way, the book is available to making of the president 2016 discounted already 20
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:53.120]  1995 info wars store.com for a limited time all of them will be signed by roger stone and myself
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:59.680]  Info or store.com. I have them in stock. It is already number one on amazon.com number one
[1:28:00.080 --> 1:28:05.920]  On amazon.com for political book already in the top 20 total, but they don't care
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:09.040]  You heard it barns and noble won't even list it and he gets worse
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:11.760]  We're gonna come back briefly and talk about this roger
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:19.200]  Joe rogan podcast has been delisted from youtube even though it has millions of views and itunes was trying to delisted as well
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:24.240]  Because we talked about podesta and we talked about wiener and the child porn charges
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:28.800]  What do you make of this censorship
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.520]  It is unbelievable. I'm just reading this here. It's extraordinary
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:39.760]  Uh, that the ongoing effort to silence us just doesn't stop and when I read that david brough
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:47.840]  Is in conversations with the government as to which websites to block as fake news
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.720]  Uh, I I shake my head. I'm asking how is david brough when trump's in now?
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:28:57.200]  Still deciding that you can't see info wars or you can't see your book
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:00.320]  I mean again because trump's surrounded by a bunch of scum
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:06.480]  Let's just say it washington's a swamp. He can't even get personnel that aren't backstabbing pieces of crap

[1:33:55.360 --> 1:33:59.360]  Hw bushy with a coin toss that happening right now. We probably should put that on screen actually
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:06.800]  Because it's just a bunch of globalists that are hated trying to go to a popular event and force themselves on us. I'm boycotting it

[1:34:49.200 --> 1:34:54.400]  The 41st president of the United States battling trump hw bush battling america selling us out in china
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:58.720]  The navy pilot shot the super satanic egomaniacs killing bones satanic rituals
[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:06.160]  Recovering super bowl propaganda not wanting to even take the transmission. Do we even pay attention to who got the coin toss right there?
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.840]  I'm glad we don't even know
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:15.840]  It's the possums versus the dirtbags. Seriously though. We're not just saying we got censored. It was in the news
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:23.600]  That cnn msnbc were banned by david brock at media matters the main soros operative
[1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:26.640]  Two weeks before trump got into office
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:33.120]  His president-elect obama passes a law signs it to put the cia over media to quote ban fake news
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:35.600]  Drugs report and info wars and breitbart
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:37.600]  now
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:43.520]  Trump's so busy trying to turn the economy on he doesn't even know that they've got advising congress right now brock
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:50.000]  On what websites to ban and shut down when he wants his chief presidential advisors site shut down
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:52.320]  Even if it was fake news, which it's not
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:55.120]  You have a right to shut it down
[1:35:55.120 --> 1:35:58.960]  We're not north korea and now this book which we're selling
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.360]  Everybody should get it. We need funds to fund ourselves. It could be a piece of toilet paper
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:08.720]  You should buy it for 1995 hell for 30 bucks. It's a big old thick juicy color photos
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:14.240]  Uh making of a president 2016 how all the stones got trumps here. It's all in here
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:19.280]  And they're trying to censor it because it went to number one on amazon political
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:24.080]  And it usually goes to number one after that. They don't want this to be made into a movie. They want to block us
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:26.160]  They want to ignore the fact
[1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:34.080]  And again, we the joe rogan podcast hitting that was should by trends hit number one on the front page of youtube
[1:36:34.080 --> 1:36:40.480]  In the trending section everybody goes to they just blocked it and then for a day they blocked it on ito
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:45.120]  I talked to joe yesterday. He says it's already the biggest thing they ever had. He sees the internal numbers
[1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  They're even blocking that from the public
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:49.920]  so again
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:54.800]  Everything we do is number one number one number one number one number one
[1:36:55.200 --> 1:37:01.120]  You're told what america wants is what's a number one. No, they give you the false number one
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:03.040]  everyone
[1:37:03.040 --> 1:37:05.760]  Has got to go and get the making of the president 2016
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:09.920]  You know, it's nutraceuticals and t-shirts and stuff that fund us and other sponsors
[1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:14.880]  I mean if I sell 50 000 copies of this book the percentage I make it's not going to fund a lot
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.400]  It'll help the operation. That's not what matters. This is a great historical book
[1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:22.080]  And they're trying to censor it info war store.com
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:28.320]  You get the book and then buy 10 of them give them to friends and family get aggressive in the info war
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:30.320]  Going back to my friend roger stone
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:33.920]  I wasn't going to go off on a jag about this, but we're truly being censored
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:38.880]  Used to if something got censored it made it cause celeb and I guess we kind of are but man
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:41.600]  We're really getting censored and you hit my hot button
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:46.000]  Because we were in in the segment when you pointed out. Yeah, brock is still in there
[1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:51.520]  I guess going to decide, you know, who trump has in the press core go ahead
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:58.160]  Well, Alex, um, it is absolutely true that both the new york times and the washington post
[1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:02.240]  And of course requested copies of my new book in advance
[1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:06.000]  And of course we supplied them as is the normal case
[1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:09.280]  They have today written nothing
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.560]  They intend to write nothing
[1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:17.040]  Uh, I'm happy to say the book has gotten very widespread publicity on
[1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:21.760]  bright part news and in other leading alternative outlets, which I think
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:26.960]  That plus info wars has helped, uh, you know, uh
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:31.920]  Uh, generate the rise of the book in terms of the international rating
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.720]  We are this close to making the new york times bestseller list
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.080]  Uh, it is entirely conceivable. We'll know within about the next couple days. So
[1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.720]  Buy your book at info wars or any place else where the book is sold
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:50.080]  To help us as a political statement as a political statement
[1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:55.040]  But regardless doesn't the new york times make itself obsolete because they've been caught saying before
[1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:58.480]  We're not going to report on conservative books that make the best list
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:05.520]  Yeah, I mean their bias is uh, is uh, manifest, uh, and I think it is obvious, but
[1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:09.360]  This book I think has a broader appeal than just
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.560]  liberty-minded conservatives and trump supporters because I explain from a
[1:39:15.680 --> 1:39:20.560]  Mechanical and analytical point of view how trump managed to pull this off
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:25.520]  And how in all honesty hillary and bill clinton were asleep at the switch
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:31.360]  That's right. This book this book shows how the establishment was delusional is delusional and isn't about the past
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:36.960]  It's about the future. I I finally read the whole I read a third of when I first got it for our left town last week
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:42.560]  I went to LA to be on Joe Rubin show read part of it on the plane there and then back amazing job and again
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:48.960]  Will your book save the world? No, but all of our actions together will and the system is truly
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:51.680]  Panicked right now and I want our listeners understand something
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:56.800]  Today I went out and shot videos down at the UT sports stadium about the Super Bowl with that as a backdrop
[1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:00.800]  I could hardly shoot the live feed because half the cars
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:03.040]  You can hear it on tape
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:08.480]  That drove by we're saying yay, Alex. We love you Alex Alex black people white people hispanics
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:12.880]  Hispanic guy with a white girl, uh, you know a black guy with a little boy
[1:40:13.440 --> 1:40:16.800]  Chinese lady or whatever humans of all types we're all the same people
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:18.800]  And it's getting to where
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:24.960]  That's actually yesterday, but it's getting to where I can't even do these reports because
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:27.360]  somebody folks come over
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:28.880]  if the listeners
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:36.000]  Simply reach out next level and keep telling neighbors friends family folks about info wars.com and the forbidden information
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:38.640]  And your book and what we're doing
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:47.120]  It's going to explode packs. I mean, I what I'm saying is I think Trump is a manifestation of the huge awakening
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:51.120]  What do you think roger? I think you're absolutely, uh, you're right, Alex
[1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:56.720]  I think that that our opponents are enemies as it were on the wrong side of history
[1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:02.160]  Down trump has come along at exactly the right time to break the yoke of globalism
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:05.760]  And to expose the entire mainstream media
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:07.920]  phony
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:09.520]  screen
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:15.040]  All right, listen in closing. I'm going to let you go. We got two minutes left other big things to watch for what's happening
[1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:24.080]  Well, uh, you identified a very important one tomorrow is the faux inauguration of a man named jovenel
[1:41:24.720 --> 1:41:32.560]  Uh, moise who claims to be the legally elected president of haiti. He is part of the clinton, uh,
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:34.080]  gang
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:41.600]  That have subjugated that party stole 80 of the earthquake aid and now seek to install
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:48.400]  This gentleman who's been in two disputed elections. The first one was so flawed so dirty so stolen
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:50.320]  They threw it out
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:52.960]  Now, uh, to our shock and surprise
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.280]  Amarosa mogul. Amarosa of the apprentice
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.800]  Now working as a trump white house aide
[1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:03.440]  recommended that the president
[1:42:03.440 --> 1:42:08.000]  Send a delegation from the white house. This would not be an official
[1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:10.320]  government
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:14.320]  Or state department delegation, of course, it wouldn't connote
[1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:17.840]  Uh, uh recognition
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:24.240]  Legally, but it sends all of the wrong signals. These are the people who rape the country
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:27.760]  They are trying to install a puppet government
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:34.000]  Now get it. They want his unofficial certification and this is him only helping the clintons as their foundation dies
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:38.320]  Trump doesn't know about this. How do we make a big noise in 20 seconds to make sure trump doesn't do it?
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:45.760]  The answer I think is rex tillerson, uh, who is the secretary state and whose wheelhouse this issue is in
[1:42:46.240 --> 1:42:50.880]  Uh, if we're going to be reaching out to the new secretary very soon, alex stay tuned
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:56.000]  All right. Thank you, roger. We'll talk to you more stone cold truth dot com get the book to make you a president
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:59.200]  2016 it's all part of the victory. Give the gift
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:05.760]  Of information by the book. Give it as a gift. We'll be back from the super bowl live coverage straight ahead
[1:43:07.760 --> 1:43:13.840]  Need more proof the political left has completely lost its mind new video surfaces of a new york university professor
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:19.520]  On the streets at a trump protest shouting and cursing like a lunatic at police at neo nazis
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:27.680]  Proudly announcing she is a professor as she loosely drops f bombs 15 times in her 82nd rant with plenty of other obscene language
[1:43:27.680 --> 1:43:32.000]  Peppered in she tells the nypd to f off. Good luck next time you need them
[1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:37.440]  Then declares trump and all his supporters are neo nazis who are not for lgbtq rights
[1:43:37.600 --> 1:43:41.200]  Even though trump did just stand for lgbtq rights in the workplace
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:48.560]  You can see this wicked creature spitting and fuming like a wild banshee as she insists the police start beating up the trump supporters
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:53.440]  So that her students don't have to we've seen white people shout down white people for being white
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:58.240]  We've seen protesters strap baby dolls to themselves then dance in the streets while playing the flute
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:03.600]  We've seen them assault people burn and destroy communities. What will the never trump movement do next?

[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:26.160]  But right now we're dealing with massive

[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:15.120]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:26.640]  These are our people
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:31.840]  This is our land
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:35.840]  These are our people
[1:47:37.680 --> 1:47:39.680]  The workers
[1:47:39.680 --> 1:47:41.520]  The striders
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:42.960]  The builders
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:44.320]  Who are they?
[1:47:44.320 --> 1:47:46.320]  These are our people
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:49.760]  Who are they?
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:53.120]  They are the dark armies
[1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:56.800]  The dark murdering armies was only honor
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:47:58.800]  Is atrocity
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.320]  The answer to 1984
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:06.560]  Is 1776
[1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:12.160]  What's crazy is that is an intro alex jones show
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:14.960]  from like a 1950s
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:18.160]  bbc production of
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:19.440]  1984
[1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:22.800]  Our our our enemies are not dark armies of third world people
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:26.320]  It's globalist manipulating different human human groups against each other
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:31.600]  But that doesn't mean we can just then open the border up and bring in giant masses of people
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:35.120]  Into a globalist program. They mean to destroy all of us with
[1:48:36.880 --> 1:48:39.440]  My low unopolis is on the show tomorrow
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.080]  um
[1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:47.600]  On the phone i'm trying to get him on via skype and he's invited me out to a live broadcast with him in miami next week
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:52.080]  Uh, i'd love to do it. We'll see if i have time. I can't just jet set out to be on joe rogan over here
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:55.280]  But we are reaching a lot of people this way. So why not?
[1:48:55.920 --> 1:49:02.000]  Uh, but uh, i'm really sick of being called a homophobe constantly. Maybe that'll help but actually he's always being demonized
[1:49:02.160 --> 1:49:06.080]  Even though he's gay if we're not wanting to ban free speech. So it's a very scary time
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:13.120]  Now owens shroyer is a great reporter for info wars and you notice usually he's very pro police officer
[1:49:14.160 --> 1:49:15.600]  very
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:17.600]  You know pro law and order, but
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.440]  I sent him to houston with three of our reporters and they've all split up and he is really upset
[1:49:23.840 --> 1:49:25.840]  He's not inside the super bowl
[1:49:25.840 --> 1:49:32.160]  Uh, he was telling our crew that you can be like a half mile away. They're not letting you walk down the street as a reporter in texas
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:36.960]  And i got they got a and and and i know i by the way, i know the police chief down there
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:39.600]  i'm friends with him our day saveta, but he just got down there
[1:49:39.760 --> 1:49:43.520]  I could probably call a cell phone i could right now that could call the police chief right now
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:49.840]  I might actually do that and say what are you doing? They're not letting you talk to people on the streets of houston
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:54.160]  so alex there's a weird dynamic happening now and
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.920]  law enforcement knows who we are they know who i am
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:00.800]  And we saw a little bit of in washington
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:04.560]  We're gonna try to boost your mic because you don't have external mic you've got internal mic on
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:08.400]  I love you guys. I sent like four people there. How are you by yourself, bro?
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:13.040]  We just get separated and you can't get along all the streets are blocked
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:16.720]  I have to walk five miles to get to the other side of the stadium
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:22.640]  Uh, now there's a helicopter in texas dps is actually hovering right above us here. I'll try to get a show
[1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:24.160]  Let's show us so this is really bad audio
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:28.160]  Can you guys boost this folks can hear it or do I have to get out of this interview because I could barely hear
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:30.160]  Does that mean the crowd can hear?
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.720]  All right, I can barely hear him you're saying it's fine on air, so I believe it
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:43.040]  Uh, that he is definitely above you. Oh, and so the police know you are and you're an evil reporter
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:48.560]  They've always been ordered to like stop reporters talking to people because what they don't want is they want anybody getting publicity
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:51.840]  but the big corporations obviously lady gaga and uh
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:56.640]  You know george herbert walker bush and the other newer people so so so
[1:50:57.120 --> 1:50:59.600]  You know, I don't even care if you're on screen. Just get up next to the mic
[1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:04.480]  That's uh are like are like aim the camera at the helicopter and get up against the mic on the phone
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:08.880]  Since you're hooked up wrong and tell me what they're doing to you. Oh, and is that better? Can you hear me now?
[1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:10.640]  That's better. Go ahead
[1:51:10.640 --> 1:51:12.080]  Okay, so yeah
[1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:17.440]  I don't know what's going on this this helicopter just started hovering right above literally just started
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:20.640]  No, I see it. So tell us what the police are doing to you. This is very shameful
[1:51:21.200 --> 1:51:24.160]  So so here's the story so in washington dc
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:28.320]  Some of the police knew who we were and they said, you know, hey, we got your back
[1:51:28.400 --> 1:51:34.160]  You know, let's not see any violence and then in austin some of the police knew who I were and they said hey shroyer
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:38.400]  You know try not to antagonize too much, but they never stopped me from actually speaking to people
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:45.040]  Alex I caught it on video. I'm over here talking to the protesters and the cops made me leave
[1:51:45.840 --> 1:51:47.840]  They made me leave alex
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:50.160]  I couldn't believe it and and here's the thing
[1:51:50.880 --> 1:51:53.600]  And the helicopter's going away now. Can you hear me better alex? Yes, I can
[1:51:54.960 --> 1:51:58.240]  This is this is an interesting dynamic that I think we need to talk about so
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:05.920]  You know, we don't we've I've had I've had run-ins with police that make you dislike police, right?
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  We've always been against the police state
[1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:08.880]  but
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:12.240]  We see how the globalists are trying to use sure they're trying to make them the enemy
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:18.160]  They're trying to cause a class of civilizations of civil war and so the average cop is not at fault for what's happening in the country
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:24.400]  And and we recognize that but what's happening now is and I blame this on the protests that have gotten violent
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:27.840]  So the protests have gotten so violent don't happen to me in DC
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:32.880]  They'd be beating me up and I would fight back and the cops would come threaten me. You know, I experience it
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:36.480]  So so now they're just shutting down free speech alex
[1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:41.840]  I'm I'm well. That's what is bring the muslims in they bring the muslims in they shoot and bomb and stab
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:47.120]  So all of us lose free speech not to make them mad the black lives matter people come out and say kill cops everything
[1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:52.320]  We go expose them and the answer is we're bad because we're antagonizing the dumbasses
[1:52:52.320 --> 1:52:57.440]  No, we're using our free speech. It's america against the problem
[1:52:58.240 --> 1:52:59.280]  and alex
[1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:01.040]  There wasn't any
[1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:05.600]  All the protesters that I've been talking to have been nice people nobody's out here being violent
[1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:08.480]  We were just having so obviously that it's not a soros group. What is this?
[1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:13.280]  I mean what what protest group is well? Well the group the group that i'm talking about right now was a uh
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:20.000]  It was an anti north dakota pipeline. They're anti pipeline. So those are environmentalists. They got a reasonable point
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.720]  Okay, I got it and they were talking and we were just having a conversation and i'm talking to this one
[1:53:24.880 --> 1:53:27.760]  So you finally found real protesters. It'll talk to you
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:30.240]  And I have to give them credit alex
[1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:34.240]  There's actually the people that I've ran into out here that are demonstrating have all been peaceful
[1:53:34.400 --> 1:53:39.360]  They've all had good points. They've all been able to back them up. Let's be clear. Normally. That's not the case
[1:53:39.920 --> 1:53:44.560]  Right and we've documented that you know hundreds of times now. Well, I can't wait to upload this cop
[1:53:44.880 --> 1:53:46.880]  I mean these police what they say to you
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:51.920]  So I'm just standing here. I'm talking to these people and the cop just comes and he just shoves me away
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:57.920]  He says quit talking quit agitating and then I think the whole thing literally the cop is literally just pushing me away from them
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:03.200]  I'm saying this is my first amendment. You're stopping my first amendment. He goes. You're agitating. You're instigating
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:06.960]  No, I mean, I know what the order is where it was probably don't let there be a riot to super bowl
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:09.360]  Stop at any cost
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:10.720]  but I mean
[1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:12.160]  Just because it
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:16.480]  Berkeley they beat people up doesn't mean you lose your first amendment. I'm sorry. I'm gonna
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.880]  I'm gonna call R.D. Savannah. I should try it right now. Hold on
[1:54:19.760 --> 1:54:21.440]  keep going
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:23.440]  Well, and it's strange because again
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:30.160]  Why it's not like we were getting violent. We were just having a conversation. I'm literally just talking to this guy
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:35.920]  I'm filming. He's talking. He's telling me why he's protesting and I get shuffled off by the police
[1:54:36.400 --> 1:54:42.240]  And I look dude. There's there's eight police on every block. There's there's there's a total police state here in Houston
[1:54:42.400 --> 1:54:45.840]  I'm having to do this broadcast live. I don't want the police to be my enemy
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:48.960]  I don't want to talk bad about the police, but they're stopping my first amendment, right?
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:52.240]  Oh, I got I got two numbers for R.D. Savannah. Let me see the answers
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:57.440]  So now I have to sit here in front of the police
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:02.320]  And complain about how they're stopping my first amendment, right? And they all look at me like I'm the bad guy
[1:55:02.640 --> 1:55:04.880]  No, you stopped my first amendment, right?
[1:55:06.720 --> 1:55:09.600]  Hey, hold on. Hey, hey, hey, hey police chief. How you doing?
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:14.000]  You can hear me. I can't hear you just text me. Are you inside the super bowl?
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.480]  I can't hear you. Can you hear me art?
[1:55:18.080 --> 1:55:22.080]  Yeah, I just call the police chief. Well, so I'm gonna call him once the show's over
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:25.120]  I'm gonna get it. He's probably inside the super bowl. Did you hear that?
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:30.800]  That's hilarious. That's crazy. He's been the awesome police chief. He's a nice guy. He's really responsive and
[1:55:31.040 --> 1:55:35.040]  He never did that here in Austin. I think the cops got better about free speech when he was here
[1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:37.040]  He had some problems too like
[1:55:37.120 --> 1:55:41.440]  But being in his heart he he didn't like, you know, the whole socialist
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:46.400]  Yeah, he's a Cuban american. So he doesn't like communist. That's a positive thing, but I will get to the bottom of this
[1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:48.240]  I'm gonna call him. All right
[1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:49.440]  All right
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:52.640]  Whatever reason he couldn't hear me. So listen, we only have a few minutes left of the broadcast
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:54.960]  What are other points to make here?
[1:55:55.040 --> 1:56:00.400]  We need to bring this to a head Alex the protesters that are protesting donald trump
[1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:05.360]  They say they don't want a dictator. They're protesting donald trump because they're afraid he's gonna be a dictator
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:12.800]  They're afraid about martial law in the poli state. They don't realize that their actions are going to make donald trump a dictator
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:17.920]  Their actions are going to bring in the poli state. It's already happening, Alex
[1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:23.200]  It's already happening and it's all because of the george soros violent protest. He's gonna get what he wants
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:24.640]  He's gonna get what now, that's it
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:30.000]  They destabilize that they have a soft civil war that they take all of our rights when they did it just like obama
[1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:32.240]  Floods us with unvetted islamicist
[1:56:32.240 --> 1:56:36.960]  Trump finally tries to do something because of all the terror attacks and then they call and then they have a judge
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:40.240]  Block him and say the president doesn't have the power to do that when he clearly does
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:47.920]  Yeah, they say it's unconstitutional when there's literally bills that say it's it's well within his legal stature
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:51.360]  To make the moves that donald trump has done but again
[1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:57.520]  It's not even about policy to these people Alex. You can try to talk to them. They don't know the first thing about policy
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:02.560]  They don't understand. Well, listen, you're doing a great job. Do some live feeds out there. Go try to talk to the processors again
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:07.200]  When the cops come and say, hey, I'm live on here. Just say we're calling our day. Savannah. What are your orders?
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:11.680]  I'm not agitating just because you define me talking to a crowd. I wouldn't talk loud though
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:16.160]  As that doesn't mean that so or do whatever you want, but upload that video too
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:20.320]  Uh, you're doing a great job. I'm out of time. I appreciate your brother
