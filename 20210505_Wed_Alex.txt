[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  I saw here that Bill and Melinda Gates are getting divorced.
[00:04.200 --> 00:05.200]  It's pretty wild.
[00:05.200 --> 00:06.960]  But anyway, I wonder what it is.
[00:06.960 --> 00:07.960]  Alex Jones.
[00:07.960 --> 00:08.960]  Yes.
[00:08.960 --> 00:09.960]  Alex.
[00:09.960 --> 00:10.960]  Come on in.
[00:10.960 --> 00:11.960]  Infowars.com.
[00:11.960 --> 00:21.080]  The Gates were so perfect together.
[00:21.080 --> 00:23.760]  They were going to call 96% of the population.
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.960]  They ate children together.
[00:24.960 --> 00:28.360]  They stayed in Jeffrey F. St. Paris and stayed 497 times.
[00:28.360 --> 00:30.920]  I just can't believe it happened.
[00:30.920 --> 00:31.920]  Infowars.com.
[00:31.920 --> 00:32.920]  Wait a second, Alex.
[00:32.920 --> 00:33.920]  Alex.
[00:33.920 --> 00:34.920]  Come on in.
[00:34.920 --> 00:38.400]  Are you saying you're upset about Bill and Melinda Gates divorcing?
[00:38.400 --> 00:39.400]  I would have thought the opposite.
[00:39.400 --> 00:43.920]  Oh, I'm so upset that they can't continue the COVID-19 crimson contagion battle plans
[00:43.920 --> 00:48.200]  to control society and the fake PCR tests with Klaus Schwab's book, The Great Reset,
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.360]  where they're going to push the eugenicist depopulation.
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.960]  Oh, I'm so upset about that.
[00:51.960 --> 00:52.960]  I'm so sorry.
[00:52.960 --> 00:53.960]  Please.
[00:53.960 --> 00:54.960]  You're being sarcastic.
[00:54.960 --> 00:56.320]  In other words, you're happy.
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.840]  You're celebrating the end of Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:59.840 --> 01:02.000]  Melinda Gates is joining the fight for freedom.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.560]  She has denounced the satanic deep state overlord husbandry's abandoning the Stockholm syndrome.
[01:06.560 --> 01:12.080]  Listen, it takes a bold person to stand up to the leader of the interdimensional vampires,
[01:12.080 --> 01:14.120]  the satanic globalist pedophile cult.
[01:14.120 --> 01:17.240]  They commit crimes against humanity to prove their credit with the aliens.
[01:17.240 --> 01:21.400]  You're saying Melinda Gates was actually suffering from Stockholm syndrome and she finally got
[01:21.400 --> 01:24.200]  away from the evil warlord Bill Gates.
[01:24.200 --> 01:25.200]  Is that correct?
[01:25.200 --> 01:27.200]  The evil known villain.
[01:27.200 --> 01:29.200]  Hold on one second.
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.680]  Howard, I'm getting a knock at my door.
[01:31.680 --> 01:32.680]  Let's see who is it coming.
[01:32.680 --> 01:34.040]  It is I, reptilian bachelor Bill Gates.
[01:34.040 --> 01:35.040]  Oh my God, Bill Gates.
[01:35.040 --> 01:36.040]  Let me ask you something.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.040]  I really want to have a serious interview.
[01:37.040 --> 01:48.040]  Gates, what was the breaking point in your marriage with Melinda?
[01:48.040 --> 01:52.840]  Melinda always complained that I left crumbs after my baby feast.
[01:52.840 --> 01:55.720]  You know, it's going to be hard for you to date.
[01:55.720 --> 01:59.840]  I mean, when you're eliminating all of humanity, how are you even going to date?
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.840]  I will slaughter all of civilization except Kaya Gerber.
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.840]  She will be queen of the sports earth.
[02:09.840 --> 02:10.840]  Kaya Gerber.
[02:10.840 --> 02:13.840]  Sounds like Kaya Gerber, right?
[02:13.840 --> 02:14.840]  Kaya Gerber.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.840]  All hail Bill Gates.
[02:15.840 --> 02:16.840]  All hail Bill Gates.
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.840]  All right.
[02:17.840 --> 02:18.840]  Well, enough out of you Gates.
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.840]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:19.840 --> 02:25.840]  If you need a quick meal in your new bachelor pad, you need Liberty Food Buckets.
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.840]  This is high performance powdered survival food.
[02:28.840 --> 02:32.600]  You got powdered lasagna, powdered burgers, powdered chicken fingers, made with the finest
[02:32.600 --> 02:35.600]  ingredients, loaded with baby powder, loaded with sawdust.
[02:35.600 --> 02:37.280]  This stuff's going to fill you up good.
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.840]  40% off with promo code, felonfouchieinfowars.com.
[02:41.840 --> 02:46.120]  Well, look, infowars.com.
[02:46.120 --> 02:47.120]  I'm thinking about it.
[02:47.120 --> 02:48.120]  It's blowing my mind.
[02:48.120 --> 02:50.280]  This was a show within a show within a show.
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.680]  I have a show going on.
[02:51.680 --> 02:54.960]  You came on with your show and then you put on another show with Bill Gates.
[02:54.960 --> 02:55.960]  So this is...
[02:55.960 --> 02:56.960]  Yeah.
[02:56.960 --> 02:59.680]  He was knocking at our door and then somebody knocked at his door.
[02:59.680 --> 03:00.680]  Right.
[03:00.680 --> 03:01.680]  Wait.
[03:01.680 --> 03:03.680]  I'm hearing imaginary knocks on the door right now.
[03:03.680 --> 03:04.680]  All right.
[03:04.680 --> 03:05.680]  Let me ask you.
[03:05.680 --> 03:07.160]  Is it hard for you to sleep at night?
[03:07.160 --> 03:10.040]  With all you know, it must be hard for you to calm down.
[03:10.040 --> 03:16.200]  Well, it's not hard when you have alpha male sleep fusions if you take every night filled
[03:16.200 --> 03:18.240]  with vitamin X, it's very good for you.
[03:18.240 --> 03:19.960]  So that's how I get to bed every night.
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.120]  But listen, I am up every night when I don't take the future because I'm just imagining
[03:24.120 --> 03:27.760]  the Satanists that want to cut our arms and legs off and how they're going to externalize
[03:27.760 --> 03:29.920]  the NSA spy system into big tech.
[03:29.920 --> 03:35.720]  How come it's taking so long for the globalists to get rid of the population?
[03:35.720 --> 03:37.360]  People are slowly getting the facts.
[03:37.360 --> 03:38.600]  They're understanding this.
[03:38.600 --> 03:43.080]  The Satanists take drugs because they want to end the veil.
[03:43.080 --> 03:46.040]  They eat children for the interdimensional pain.
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.880]  Human aliens hand over the inventions.
[03:47.880 --> 03:48.880]  That's how we got the wheel.
[03:48.880 --> 03:49.880]  That's how we got the television.
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.880]  That's how we got the iPhone.
[03:50.880 --> 03:53.320]  They feed off dark energy.
[03:53.320 --> 03:54.320]  Right Bill Gates?
[03:54.320 --> 03:56.320]  All hail Bill Gates.
[03:56.320 --> 03:57.320]  Yes.
[03:57.320 --> 03:59.040]  Do you ever have a margarita on the beach?
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.040]  I mean, still out.
[04:00.040 --> 04:04.320]  I mean, it's, to me, it's just intense your world.
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.320]  It really is.
[04:05.320 --> 04:06.640]  Listen, I like a little good whiskey.
[04:06.640 --> 04:09.560]  We got some good whiskey here in Austin to sit down and have a little bit of Bluebell
[04:09.560 --> 04:10.560]  ice cream.
[04:10.560 --> 04:12.080]  I love all of those kind of things.
[04:12.080 --> 04:17.360]  The core goal is taking down the megabanks, taking down the powerful elites, taking down
[04:17.360 --> 04:19.160]  the prime controllers, taking down the graves.
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.160]  You know, I look at some people.
[04:20.160 --> 04:22.520]  I look at Teddy Roosevelt, for example.
[04:22.520 --> 04:24.120]  That man, the man's my hero.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.120]  He was an elitist.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.120]  Right.
[04:26.120 --> 04:27.120]  But he wanted to empower people.
[04:27.120 --> 04:29.000]  He made the great national parks.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.720]  He pissed off and fed when I break up the big banks and the monopolies and that's the
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.240]  kind of man that I look to, I aspire to, not these chicken neck perverts who want to sterilize
[04:38.240 --> 04:42.600]  the population and put that human breeding program and the cloning programs, these globalist
[04:42.600 --> 04:43.600]  and Democrat Nazis.
[04:43.600 --> 04:44.600]  All right.
[04:44.600 --> 04:45.600]  All right.
[04:45.600 --> 04:49.240]  Listen, Alex, we got to go because I have my own commercials and own show to run.
[04:49.240 --> 04:50.240]  I can't run your show.
[04:50.240 --> 04:51.240]  Yeah, you've got your own products.
[04:51.240 --> 04:52.240]  The push.
[04:52.240 --> 04:53.240]  All right.
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.240]  I'm going to go take a fish.
[04:54.240 --> 04:56.440]  I'll be back right after these words.
[04:56.440 --> 04:57.440]  All right.
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.440]  There we go.
[04:58.440 --> 04:59.440]  All right.
[04:59.440 --> 05:00.440]  There we go.
[05:00.440 --> 05:05.360]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are
[05:05.360 --> 05:08.560]  most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[05:08.560 --> 05:11.280]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[05:11.280 --> 05:15.080]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[05:15.080 --> 05:17.520]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[05:17.520 --> 05:21.080]  That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.080]  be buying it.
[05:22.080 --> 05:25.640]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out just like you notice a lot of
[05:25.640 --> 05:30.400]  other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.800]  Finally, X2 is back in stock, the good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide so essential in
[05:36.800 --> 05:37.800]  your body.
[05:37.800 --> 05:38.800]  It's really the missing link.
[05:38.800 --> 05:39.800]  It's 50% off.
[05:39.800 --> 05:42.800]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[05:42.800 --> 05:46.520]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[05:46.520 --> 05:51.040]  of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget
[05:51.040 --> 05:56.080]  how great it is and not take it myself, but when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss,
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.080]  it's incredible.
[05:57.080 --> 05:58.080]  It's essential.
[05:58.080 --> 05:59.080]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[05:59.080 --> 06:00.080]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going
[06:00.080 --> 06:07.080]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[06:07.080 --> 06:22.080]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.080 --> 06:29.080]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[06:29.080 --> 06:56.080]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[06:56.080 --> 07:16.080]  It was being set up the last 75 years of the information war.
[07:16.080 --> 07:18.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:18.080 --> 07:23.080]  But now it's here.
[07:23.080 --> 07:34.080]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, May 5th, global transmission.
[07:34.080 --> 07:39.240]  We have Dr. Joseph Merkola joining us in the second hour.
[07:39.240 --> 07:44.600]  He is the number one health and wellness medical doctor in the world.
[07:44.600 --> 07:48.760]  He is the granddaddy of the whole movement that fought to keep supplements legal in the
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.160]  laws that were passed when they tried to outlaw supplements in the mid 1990s.
[07:53.160 --> 08:00.680]  He's done just an absolutely amazing job over the years.
[08:00.680 --> 08:09.200]  And he has now been threatened into removing off of his website all the mainline science
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.960]  about vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and more and about ivermectin, about hydroxychloric
[08:13.960 --> 08:17.280]  when it is just more criminal activity by the cartel.
[08:17.280 --> 08:22.640]  They put out a large, lengthy, hitless report, financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[08:22.640 --> 08:26.720]  that even called for the CIA, in fact, guys, pull that from yesterday's stack.
[08:26.720 --> 08:32.440]  I forgot to pull that study back out, even called for the CIA and the Pentagon to go
[08:32.440 --> 08:38.840]  after quote, anti-vaxxers and to basically eradicate folks.
[08:38.840 --> 08:45.520]  So that is all coming up in the second hour today.
[08:45.520 --> 08:50.000]  And then we have Nick Fuentes, who's got a huge announcement that he's going to debut
[08:50.000 --> 08:56.800]  here on air for you in the third hour with his lawyer dealing with the no fly list and
[08:56.800 --> 08:58.680]  that major test case.
[08:58.680 --> 09:01.600]  And the government's now confirmed, yeah, you're on a no fly list.
[09:01.600 --> 09:04.960]  We're not going to tell you why extremely.
[09:04.960 --> 09:05.960]  Orwellian.
[09:05.960 --> 09:12.120]  Well, I told you it was coming and now they're doing trials on the general public on newborn
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.640]  babies, six-month-old babies, two-year-old babies, and some are dying.
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.400]  Many are having autoimmune responses and swelling up like tomatoes and having blood
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.480]  clots.
[09:21.480 --> 09:26.120]  And now they're moving to have just emergency authorization for the gene therapy, the Franken
[09:26.120 --> 09:31.640]  shots of Pfizer and then Moderna and then Bill Gates's mRNA vaccine, though he's behind
[09:31.640 --> 09:33.760]  all three groups and part owner of those.
[09:33.760 --> 09:39.720]  And as Brad, he gets a 20 to one return on his investment.
[09:39.720 --> 09:42.280]  And so we're going to be looking at that in great detail.
[09:42.280 --> 09:45.120]  Also, Greg Ries normally does five-minute reports.
[09:45.120 --> 09:49.600]  He has put together a tour de force that we've not even posted yet at Bandat video that
[09:49.600 --> 09:57.840]  will be premiering in the last segment of this hour dealing with the Illuminati Unmasked,
[09:57.840 --> 10:05.400]  unlimited look into that very powerful report to understand the mindset of these predators
[10:05.400 --> 10:08.480]  of these parasites.
[10:08.480 --> 10:19.280]  So that is coming up today in the final segment of this hour.
[10:19.280 --> 10:27.000]  I will also do my best to take calls when Nick Fuentes is on in the third hour.
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.800]  And then we have a special guest host who I'm inviting on who's a very articulate, amazing
[10:31.800 --> 10:36.920]  lady, Dr. Jane Ruby, who was really impressive with us last week.
[10:36.920 --> 10:40.000]  She is going to be joining us as well.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.400]  Well, I'm obviously very angry and very upset.
[10:43.400 --> 10:46.400]  They are trying to make it mandatory to take vaccines.
[10:46.400 --> 10:49.200]  Governments are now announcing, basically, if you want to get on a train or go to a grocery
[10:49.200 --> 10:53.760]  store or get on a plane or have a job, we're going to intimidate the corporations to do
[10:53.760 --> 10:55.000]  this.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  This is the medical training.
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.200]  This is the takeover.
[10:57.200 --> 11:04.680]  And the bad reactions, the death, the autoimmune responses, the allergic responses are just
[11:04.680 --> 11:05.680]  founcing out.
[11:05.680 --> 11:12.920]  Just want to, like a damn, just absolutely breaking and we're going to be laying out
[11:12.920 --> 11:19.400]  some really important parallels and developments to this and to what Big Pharma is doing and
[11:19.400 --> 11:25.760]  Big Pharma's nightmare history of just unparalleled corruption coming up the start of the next
[11:25.760 --> 11:26.760]  segment.
[11:26.760 --> 11:32.000]  New York Governor Cuomo on high schoolers put them on a bus and bring them to a mass
[11:32.000 --> 11:33.760]  vaccination site.
[11:33.760 --> 11:39.480]  We forced them via peer pressure to do it, DC mayor bans dancing, standing at weddings.
[11:39.480 --> 11:41.640]  Yeah, it's a cult.
[11:41.640 --> 11:43.000]  You'll follow the orders.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.440]  They're getting an army of people who will do whatever they're told.
[11:46.440 --> 11:51.960]  Far left mag, libs ignoring scientific evidence to virtue signal for indefinite lockdowns.
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.600]  Well, I guess you left us like it, so you're in a cult club.
[11:56.600 --> 11:58.440]  That's on infowars.com.
[11:58.440 --> 12:04.640]  This is the big parallel to the deadly vaccines that are really Franken shots, 10.9 billion
[12:04.640 --> 12:09.400]  to settle roundup lawsuits, admitting that roundup does indeed cause cancer and they
[12:09.400 --> 12:10.400]  know he lied about it.
[12:10.400 --> 12:16.440]  And that, of course, was a division working with Monsanto of Bayer Pharmaceutical that
[12:16.440 --> 12:19.080]  also brought you HIV and the blood by design.
[12:19.080 --> 12:25.480]  We're going to be looking at all of that next segment, really, really big developments
[12:25.480 --> 12:28.520]  on that front.
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.360]  We are also going to get into a very disgusting area.
[12:32.360 --> 12:35.800]  And that is the fact that Sigmund Freud was a pedophile.
[12:35.800 --> 12:43.280]  And then most of the founders of modern psychology in the last 130 years were avowed buggerers
[12:43.280 --> 12:45.880]  of children as it was called at the time.
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.240]  Most of them had sex with their children and then they pass it on down and this is really
[12:51.240 --> 12:52.240]  their cult takeover.
[12:52.240 --> 12:57.720]  I have a stack of mainstream news where they admit this is going on and governments in
[12:57.720 --> 13:03.800]  the US, the UK and Germany are delivering children to pedophiles so that they can be
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.280]  brought up in a proper way of life, not the nuclear family.
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.480]  These are quotes that they can be shown the true love of man boy.
[13:11.480 --> 13:17.720]  And so three year old boys are given to convicted pedophiles to be gang raped and that is mainstream
[13:17.720 --> 13:18.720]  news.
[13:18.720 --> 13:19.960]  We're going to tell you all about it.
[13:19.960 --> 13:33.320]  And then that ties into, in Canada, one psychologist alone has 500 orphans under him as young as
[13:33.320 --> 13:36.840]  three now transferring to a new gender.
[13:36.840 --> 13:43.760]  Yes, at three they can be convinced by a psychologist because kids like to do role playing to have
[13:43.760 --> 13:47.240]  their genitals cut off and they put them on the track to do that.
[13:47.240 --> 13:51.040]  And that ties into all this so I'm going to break this down.
[13:51.040 --> 13:58.320]  The government, again, when Kathy is Keith and the other books that the government places
[13:58.320 --> 14:06.840]  children with him, 500 plus, but there's lots of AIDS ribbons in the children's books.
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.920]  They're going to be learning about getting HIV as well and all the other fun things that
[14:11.920 --> 14:16.800]  go with the culture of death and depopulation.
[14:16.800 --> 14:21.520]  So the summer of 2021 is going to be abnormally violent as murders continue to rise all over
[14:21.520 --> 14:28.200]  the world as food prices rise by the end of the summer, 76% in the global Bloomberg Agra
[14:28.200 --> 14:29.200]  index.
[14:29.200 --> 14:32.480]  The crops being grown now worldwide have already been purchased, most of them.
[14:32.480 --> 14:37.400]  When you aggregate it together in the Agra analysis, no pun intended, where you get the
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.920]  word aggregating, it's putting all the seeds together, but they aggregate the numbers on
[14:40.920 --> 14:45.120]  Agra and we are looking at a 76% increase.
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.040]  And the projections go up about 120% into the next year.
[14:49.040 --> 14:51.680]  That will cause hell upon earth to unfold.
[14:51.680 --> 14:56.280]  The globalists will say it's black on white, light on black globally, and say it's a Black
[14:56.280 --> 15:00.680]  Lives Matter movement as everybody riots because their EBT cards still work but won't buy enough
[15:00.680 --> 15:01.680]  food.
[15:01.680 --> 15:06.280]  And then the communist globalists think they'll ride the civil instability they've created
[15:06.280 --> 15:09.320]  with a financial collapse to total absolute control.
[15:09.320 --> 15:14.840]  World government force inoculations, universal guaranteed income, the global social score
[15:14.840 --> 15:17.840]  run by AI, cracking your every move.
[15:17.840 --> 15:21.080]  So that is all coming up today, but you can fight back.
[15:21.080 --> 15:24.760]  If you're listening to us on a local radio station or TV station you're watching, tell
[15:24.760 --> 15:25.760]  people about it.
[15:25.760 --> 15:31.360]  If you've got a barn, paint info or a zonator, band-aute video, if you're a pastor or a police
[15:31.360 --> 15:36.680]  officer or somebody that is able to influence others more or a influencer online, keep the
[15:36.680 --> 15:38.200]  fight going.
[15:38.200 --> 15:39.560]  We're going to win this together.
[15:39.560 --> 15:44.200]  Prohuman against the globalists don't let them divide and conquer us, but realize they
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.840]  are collapsing the third world and organizing them into leftist armies to come here, bankrupt
[15:48.840 --> 15:52.520]  the country, implode the economy, and be a permanent underclass that's also extremely
[15:52.520 --> 15:53.520]  anti-Christian, anti-white.
[15:53.520 --> 15:54.520]  We've got to somehow stop that.
[15:54.520 --> 15:55.520]  We'll be right back.
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.520]  Stay with us.
[15:56.520 --> 16:04.320]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been Alex Jones was
[16:04.320 --> 16:10.200]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.360]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[16:13.360 --> 16:16.960]  Well, let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today, and thanks for your support.
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.000]  We're still on air at infowars.com and band-aute video from radio stations and TV stations
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.000]  across the country.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.160]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[16:26.160 --> 16:28.160]  ago, is now available again.
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.880]  We have repredited it on high quality DVD, in HD, it has a zero country code, any anyone
[16:32.880 --> 16:36.720]  in the world is authorized to make copies of it, and I'm asking you to get the original,
[16:36.720 --> 16:39.840]  make copies, give it to everyone you know, air it on local access TV, give it to your
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.720]  pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever you do, warn
[16:43.720 --> 16:44.720]  the world.
[16:44.720 --> 16:49.160]  This film uses their own documents and those statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[16:49.160 --> 16:52.720]  It's more important than ever, available at infowars.com.
[16:52.720 --> 16:55.920]  That's infowars.com, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[16:55.920 --> 17:02.320]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[17:02.320 --> 17:03.320]  Hello, can you hear me?
[17:03.320 --> 17:04.320]  I sure can sir, thank you.
[17:04.320 --> 17:09.320]  Hey Alex, before I start man, I just wanted to talk to you, go and it's a pleasure to
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.320]  be talking right now.
[17:10.320 --> 17:12.320]  Sure, it's an honor to talk to you brother.
[17:12.320 --> 17:17.960]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver and Tuber
[17:17.960 --> 17:24.440]  Force have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we
[17:24.440 --> 17:32.160]  are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and Rola and
[17:32.160 --> 17:35.760]  I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[17:35.760 --> 17:36.760]  for that man.
[17:36.760 --> 17:41.280]  Brother, we put more in this than any other long term high quality energy powder there
[17:41.280 --> 17:45.000]  is, so this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.960]  on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[17:47.960 --> 17:52.440]  formulation just for the design of it and we believe it is the best, strongest but healthiest
[17:52.440 --> 17:55.880]  energy out there and you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot
[17:55.880 --> 17:56.880]  to me, thank you.
[17:56.880 --> 18:01.120]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[18:01.120 --> 18:22.560]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones show and as bad as
[18:22.560 --> 18:27.680]  the global censorship is and as much as they've been suppressing thousands of medical doctors
[18:27.680 --> 18:32.800]  and nurses here in the U.S. alone, not to mention around the world, the truth about
[18:32.800 --> 18:36.560]  COVID-19 is coming out, the truth about the vaccines not being vaccines, not protecting
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.680]  us, coming out, the truth about the PCR test being fake is coming out, the truth about
[18:40.680 --> 18:44.440]  Bill Gates being behind all the companies is coming out, the fact that the Pfizer and
[18:44.440 --> 18:49.120]  the Moderna and the AstraZeneca and the Australian government vaccine and a whole bunch of others
[18:49.120 --> 18:53.680]  have been banned in Australia and South Africa and 21 countries in Europe and the Philippines
[18:53.680 --> 19:00.480]  and Russia and here we're told oh, we're just going to approve them all, they're all good.
[19:00.480 --> 19:04.080]  They've all been studied as they give them to you live, they go oh, we don't think you
[19:04.080 --> 19:07.960]  died, we don't think you got a blood clot from this, we don't think you and they cherry
[19:07.960 --> 19:13.600]  picked the stories and just picked a few to make it look like only a few were happening
[19:13.600 --> 19:16.360]  when it is a devastating assault.
[19:16.360 --> 19:21.320]  But the whole time we've been lied to, remember, two and a half million Americans were going
[19:21.320 --> 19:29.760]  to be dead in the first six months, oh, there was no known treatment for this virus, ivermectin,
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.800]  hydroxychloroquine, all of it because if they said there was another treatment, they couldn't
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.880]  get emergency authorization for the gene therapy.
[19:38.880 --> 19:42.440]  That these companies for 20 years invested hundreds of billions of dollars in it could
[19:42.440 --> 19:48.640]  never get a single government to approve them, China who does all the franken stuff won't
[19:48.640 --> 19:53.720]  even approve MRNA on their general population, they tested on their military.
[19:53.720 --> 19:57.440]  That's what we used to do here, still illegal, still wrong in my view.
[19:57.440 --> 20:00.600]  Very unethical, violates the Nuremberg code, the list goes on and on.
[20:00.600 --> 20:05.040]  So what you're seeing by every yardstick according to top international lawyers that are the
[20:05.040 --> 20:10.800]  world experts on this, on this show like Dr. Francis Boyle and others, this is illegal.
[20:10.800 --> 20:16.200]  The former chief scientist advisor, this is illegal, the head of the main EU advisory
[20:16.200 --> 20:20.680]  board, Wolfgang Wudarg, this is dangerous and illegal.
[20:20.680 --> 20:26.240]  It's not like I'm kind of out in the gray or out on a limb here, so despite all the censorship
[20:26.240 --> 20:33.120]  in the last month since the inoculation deaths and injuries exploded, without even trying,
[20:33.120 --> 20:36.680]  people call me every day and they go, you know you're trending number five on Twitter,
[20:36.680 --> 20:43.200]  you're trending number one, and I go check, we're in the top 10 of Twitter every day now.
[20:43.200 --> 20:46.560]  You type in Alex Jones, they can't even suppress it.
[20:46.560 --> 20:48.360]  You type it in a TikTok, they can't suppress it.
[20:48.360 --> 20:50.840]  You type it in that they can't suppress it.
[20:50.840 --> 20:53.360]  And I'm just one symbol in the resistance.
[20:53.360 --> 20:59.680]  So as negative as this all is, the globalists are like Hitler or Napoleon going into Russia.
[20:59.680 --> 21:07.560]  At first they're winning, but in time, their tracks, their wheels grind into the mud.
[21:07.560 --> 21:10.080]  Their horses sink into the mud.
[21:10.080 --> 21:17.080]  People are upset, people are waking up, but I saw this comment over and over again.
[21:17.080 --> 21:18.080]  What do we do?
[21:18.080 --> 21:22.080]  Well, I know somebody got sick from one of these shots, and I know that they said we
[21:22.080 --> 21:25.200]  got to wear a mask regardless, and they said we wouldn't have to wear a mask after we got
[21:25.200 --> 21:33.720]  them, and I took it and I got a blood clot, but is it really as bad as he says, or how
[21:33.720 --> 21:36.240]  does he know they're this bad?
[21:36.240 --> 21:40.880]  Because I've studied Big Pharma for 30 years, I've been on there 27, and I look at hundreds
[21:40.880 --> 21:48.080]  of articles a day, and I've seen the OxyCotton company, I've seen Bayer, I've seen Merck,
[21:48.080 --> 21:54.280]  I've seen Pfizer, I've seen all of them get caught in lawsuits where they admit they
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.960]  knew a product they had didn't work and or was killing people or making them sick.
[21:58.960 --> 22:04.280]  I mean, the list goes on and on with Finn Finn and eating her heart valves and women
[22:04.280 --> 22:09.160]  being given tranquilizers that deform their babies and the attempts to cover it up and
[22:09.160 --> 22:15.920]  Dalekon Shield sterilizing women by the millions, including my mother and my grandmother, given
[22:15.920 --> 22:20.200]  polio by the polio vaccine told by our doctor, and I've got congressional hearings on what
[22:20.200 --> 22:21.200]  they did to my grandmother.
[22:21.200 --> 22:24.280]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[22:24.280 --> 22:32.000]  So there's an article out today where Bayer only a division of it was selling Roundup.
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.720]  They haven't gone up to Monsanto that created it yet.
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.720]  I mean, I guess that's happening in court, but Bayer's agreed to pay 10.6 million, which
[22:39.720 --> 22:42.240]  sounds like a lot for tens of millions in the U.S.
[22:42.240 --> 22:44.400]  Diagon cancer.
[22:44.400 --> 22:47.720]  They didn't have breast cancer to speak of, maybe one in 20 million.
[22:47.720 --> 22:50.760]  It was super rare in Brazil.
[22:50.760 --> 22:56.600]  A decade after Roundup's been adopted in Brazil, their breast cancer is almost as high as ours.
[22:56.600 --> 22:59.800]  Almost every woman gets it by 50 or 60.
[22:59.800 --> 23:06.520]  So just when I hear the name Bayer, okay, Bayer worked for Hitler and Joseph Mengele
[23:06.520 --> 23:09.800]  and helped kill people in medical death camps.
[23:09.800 --> 23:13.720]  Bayer knowingly worked with Bill Clinton for 15 years to ship contaminated blood knowingly
[23:13.720 --> 23:18.840]  that they falsely certified out of the state of Arkansas to be mixed on purpose into factor
[23:18.840 --> 23:25.360]  eight platelet drug that then gave conservatively over 20 million people HIV and hepatitis and
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.000]  at least 2 million are known to have died when the settlements were done over a decade
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.880]  ago.
[23:31.880 --> 23:40.520]  And in the documents, in the documents that Bayer also brought you, heroin, that's what
[23:40.520 --> 23:46.240]  they invented to get you off of opium because it's only 10 times stronger or more.
[23:46.240 --> 23:52.320]  They're like, oxycontin will cure you of heroin because it's 50 times stronger.
[23:52.320 --> 23:56.880]  And remember, oh, but Frank Luntz is a liberal conservative, he said it's good for you, oxycontin
[23:56.880 --> 23:57.880]  is good.
[23:57.880 --> 23:58.880]  It must be true.
[23:58.880 --> 24:03.200]  So it's the same PR people out of control with these dangerous companies that are eugenics-based
[24:03.200 --> 24:08.120]  and when it came out about Bayer in Australia and in France is where the documents came
[24:08.120 --> 24:12.600]  out, it was the chief executives in those countries saying, we'll go ahead and just
[24:12.600 --> 24:14.000]  dump this factor eight.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.160]  Well, we've got, you know, 100 million doses of this and all of it has HIV and hepatitis.
[24:19.160 --> 24:20.160]  It'll give everybody this.
[24:20.160 --> 24:21.880]  And they said, screw them.
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.120]  We've got too many hemophiliacs, the world will be better without them.
[24:25.120 --> 24:26.560]  So that's a starting point.
[24:26.560 --> 24:30.960]  And every one of these companies has been caught doing similar crap.
[24:30.960 --> 24:36.760]  Now Monsanto, the parent company that brought you this with Roundup, remember had their
[24:36.760 --> 24:42.240]  chief scientist and Pat Moore would go around for decades.
[24:42.240 --> 24:49.360]  I remember being like 10 years old and watching him on TV say, you can drink Roundup.
[24:49.360 --> 24:52.560]  My mother going, is that true David to my dad and my dad going, well, I use it in the
[24:52.560 --> 24:54.640]  yard, but I wouldn't drink it.
[24:54.640 --> 24:59.040]  Remember, I walked in front of my dad while he was spraying weeds and I got it on my legs
[24:59.040 --> 25:00.280]  and I said, should I wash this off?
[25:00.280 --> 25:02.120]  My dad back then still bought the propaganda.
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.080]  He goes, well, they say you can drink it, but yeah, I'd go wash it off.
[25:07.080 --> 25:08.080]  That's who these people are.
[25:08.080 --> 25:12.640]  And these very same people are telling you, oh, this experimental mRNA, it's safe.
[25:12.640 --> 25:13.640]  Take it.
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.360]  When in all the animal studies for 20 years, it maimed and sterilized and mutated and killed
[25:18.360 --> 25:19.360]  the animals.
[25:19.360 --> 25:22.880]  That's why they skipped them in this trial because they already know what it does and
[25:22.880 --> 25:25.720]  they're giving it to us for population control.
[25:25.720 --> 25:26.720]  Period.
[25:26.720 --> 25:28.920]  It's a fact.
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.960]  Here is the spokesperson, Pat Moore, when somebody said on French TV, here, go ahead
[25:34.960 --> 25:35.960]  and drink some.
[25:35.960 --> 25:36.960]  Here it is.
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.760]  The glyphosate in Argentina is causing increases in cancer.
[25:40.760 --> 25:44.080]  You can drink a whole quart of it and it won't hurt you.
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.080]  You want to drink some?
[25:45.080 --> 25:46.080]  We have some here.
[25:46.080 --> 25:50.920]  I'm not happy to actually, but not really, but I know it wouldn't hurt me.
[25:50.920 --> 25:51.920]  If you say so.
[25:51.920 --> 25:52.920]  I have some glyphosate.
[25:52.920 --> 25:53.920]  No, I'm not stupid.
[25:53.920 --> 25:54.920]  Okay.
[25:54.920 --> 25:55.920]  So you...
[25:55.920 --> 25:56.920]  No, but I know it's dangerous, right?
[25:56.920 --> 25:57.920]  I know...
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.640]  No, people try to commit suicide with it and fail fairly regularly.
[26:00.640 --> 26:01.640]  That's the truth.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.120]  It's not dangerous to humans.
[26:03.120 --> 26:04.120]  No, it's not.
[26:04.120 --> 26:06.040]  So are you ready to drink one glass of glyphosate?
[26:06.040 --> 26:08.440]  No, I'm not an idiot.
[26:08.440 --> 26:09.440]  Interview me about golden rice.
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.440]  That's what I'm talking about.
[26:10.440 --> 26:11.440]  Okay.
[26:11.440 --> 26:12.440]  Then it's finished.
[26:12.440 --> 26:19.960]  Okay, so when you see all these big talk show hosts on radio and TV, from Stephen Colbert
[26:19.960 --> 26:23.720]  to John Oliver to all of them, saying, oh, you got to take it, it's totally safe.
[26:23.720 --> 26:24.720]  Take it.
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.600]  Their companies are on record paid hundreds of millions of dollars to say that.
[26:28.600 --> 26:30.120]  Their paychecks coming from that.
[26:30.120 --> 26:32.680]  They're now pure PR men, pure product placement.
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.440]  They're not advertising Miller Lite or Doritos or even Camels, which is bad enough.
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.680]  No, the same media empires that sold you, you know, got us for a throw?
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.280]  Not a cough, smoke an extra camel.
[26:44.280 --> 26:48.840]  No, doctors recommend camel over other cigarettes for your lung health.
[26:48.840 --> 26:51.080]  They're now telling you the same crap today.
[26:51.080 --> 26:53.320]  They're a pack of criminal mercenaries.
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.120]  We'll be right back.
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.560]  The world is awakening.
[26:59.560 --> 27:03.080]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[27:03.080 --> 27:08.440]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.400]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[27:14.400 --> 27:19.560]  And so even though it seems like the globalist are winning, the truth is they've had to
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.160]  come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[27:24.160 --> 27:27.320]  We have forced them out in the open.
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.200]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[27:31.200 --> 27:33.160]  Realize humanity is winning.
[27:33.160 --> 27:38.280]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.720]  That is invincible.
[27:39.720 --> 27:43.040]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[27:43.040 --> 27:47.920]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and to take action
[27:47.920 --> 27:51.840]  against the globalist and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[27:51.840 --> 27:52.840]  to you.
[27:52.840 --> 27:58.080]  We will never back down from the globalist and we will never surrender.
[27:58.080 --> 28:01.720]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.720]  I say, thank you for what you've done.
[28:04.720 --> 28:06.640]  Thank you for keeping info wars on the air.
[28:06.640 --> 28:10.240]  Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[28:10.240 --> 28:15.920]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or
[28:15.920 --> 28:20.640]  droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[28:20.640 --> 28:25.040]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where
[28:25.040 --> 28:26.680]  you go and what you do.
[28:26.680 --> 28:30.440]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the
[28:30.440 --> 28:34.120]  globalist are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state, we need to more
[28:34.120 --> 28:38.640]  and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved
[28:38.640 --> 28:39.640]  in.
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.440]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings, they're available at infowarstore.com in four
[28:43.440 --> 28:46.480]  different colors and they are only $19.95.
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.640]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[28:50.640 --> 28:53.920]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war.
[28:53.920 --> 28:58.560]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the info war.
[28:58.560 --> 29:04.360]  Last week, I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission and he said to me, he said,
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.000]  Alex, there's all these facts and all these numbers of vaccines being recalled and people
[29:08.000 --> 29:10.160]  dying from it and people getting sick.
[29:10.160 --> 29:14.160]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about
[29:14.160 --> 29:15.160]  the danger?
[29:15.160 --> 29:19.920]  And I said to him, something very profound because it's so true, trust your gut, trust
[29:19.920 --> 29:20.920]  your spirit.
[29:20.920 --> 29:21.920]  The Bible tells us.
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.560]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this
[29:27.560 --> 29:28.560]  vaccine?
[29:28.560 --> 29:30.640]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it.
[29:30.640 --> 29:32.280]  So go with your gut.
[29:32.280 --> 29:37.040]  Well, let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting the storeable food?
[29:37.040 --> 29:39.200]  How does your gut feel about getting out in the countryside?
[29:39.200 --> 29:42.040]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[29:42.040 --> 29:44.120]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.160]  We have the best storeable food, the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going
[29:47.160 --> 29:53.520]  to find, 10% off at infowarstore.com right now or for Paradox.com.
[29:53.520 --> 29:57.920]  Know with your gut and find the infowar, infowarstore.com.
[29:57.920 --> 30:00.320]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[30:00.320 --> 30:02.200]  It's very bittersweet.
[30:02.200 --> 30:05.040]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[30:05.040 --> 30:07.120]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[30:07.120 --> 30:08.720]  I care about beating the new world order.
[30:08.720 --> 30:13.960]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[30:13.960 --> 30:17.200]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[30:17.200 --> 30:20.800]  I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this, we're going to see this through
[30:20.800 --> 30:24.480]  to the end, we're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[30:24.480 --> 30:28.120]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com.
[30:28.120 --> 30:30.680]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[30:30.680 --> 30:33.840]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[30:33.840 --> 30:34.840]  Do they fund freedom?
[30:34.840 --> 30:35.840]  No, a lot of them don't.
[30:35.840 --> 30:40.520]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking
[30:40.520 --> 30:42.360]  up and looking for truth.
[30:42.360 --> 30:44.000]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.400]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[30:47.400 --> 30:50.880]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[30:50.880 --> 30:51.960]  Download everything we've done.
[30:51.960 --> 30:55.480]  You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and
[30:55.480 --> 31:01.440]  the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[31:01.440 --> 31:10.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[31:10.240 --> 31:26.400]  I'm no stranger to the rain, I'm a friend of thunder, a friend is it any wonder a lot
[31:26.400 --> 31:27.400]  of them strides me.
[31:27.400 --> 31:28.400]  I've parked with the devil, got down on his level, but I never gave in.
[31:28.400 --> 31:29.400]  So he gave up on me.
[31:29.400 --> 31:53.360]  I'm no stranger to the rain, I can spot bad weather, and I'm good at finding shelter
[31:53.360 --> 32:07.320]  I've been sacrificed by brothers, crucified by lovers, but through it, I've withstood
[32:07.320 --> 32:08.320]  the pain.
[32:08.320 --> 32:11.760]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[32:11.760 --> 32:16.800]  Wednesday live, UN announces criminal plan to forcibly inject children with dangerous
[32:16.800 --> 32:21.000]  mRNA franken shots.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.480]  Any way that transmission gets out is if you take action, red grease is going to premiere
[32:26.480 --> 32:32.280]  an incredibly powerful report on the mindset, the operating system of the Illuminati of these
[32:32.280 --> 32:33.280]  occultists.
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.920]  It's a very powerful report coming up next segment, but let me go ahead and dig into what
[32:38.920 --> 32:41.120]  I was just laying out.
[32:41.120 --> 32:44.320]  The average nurse, the average doctor means well, and when the average doctor or nurse
[32:44.320 --> 32:49.160]  has questions and points out the medical literature, they get silenced or they get in trouble or
[32:49.160 --> 32:50.160]  they get fired.
[32:50.160 --> 32:54.880]  They have to all come together and say no, or we just get pulled deeper down into the
[32:54.880 --> 32:55.880]  spider hole.
[32:55.880 --> 33:01.720]  So I want to be your tour guide to the rabbit hole, because we're already in the rabbit
[33:01.720 --> 33:02.720]  hole.
[33:02.720 --> 33:06.720]  And if we don't figure out what's going on in the rabbit hole, you get pulled down even
[33:06.720 --> 33:09.000]  deeper into the spider hole.
[33:09.000 --> 33:16.640]  And the only way you get out of this globalist system is becoming aware of how it operates.
[33:16.640 --> 33:20.880]  All right, I want to really burrow into the latest developments with them targeting our
[33:20.880 --> 33:26.480]  children, targeting newborn babies now in the studies and what the estimates are on the
[33:26.480 --> 33:31.800]  fact that fast-growing cells are attacked even more because they have these proteins
[33:31.800 --> 33:36.720]  in them and this is just going to be so devastating to children, so devastating to pregnant women.
[33:36.720 --> 33:39.360]  It's already causing a huge amount of miscarriages.
[33:39.360 --> 33:43.080]  And they're just setting a precedent to normalize it and to make it no big deal and go, it's
[33:43.080 --> 33:44.480]  no big deal yet, a miscarriage.
[33:44.480 --> 33:47.520]  No big deal, your dad died, or your brother died, or your mom died.
[33:47.520 --> 33:48.520]  Let's just move on.
[33:48.520 --> 33:52.120]  Sure, your mom fell down two days later and died after the shot, and it had nothing to
[33:52.120 --> 33:55.120]  do with it.
[33:55.120 --> 33:57.720]  And then they'll even lie and say, oh, Hank Aaron had an autopsy.
[33:57.720 --> 34:03.160]  When the vaccine and Robert Tenney Jr. contacted the family, got it on record, they said no,
[34:03.160 --> 34:04.960]  no autopsy was done.
[34:04.960 --> 34:09.920]  They've had medical doctors, and in the case of the young people that die, do autopsies
[34:09.920 --> 34:16.840]  and say, yeah, total organ failure, autoimmune response from the vaccines.
[34:16.840 --> 34:19.320]  The body rejected its own organs.
[34:19.320 --> 34:26.920]  And that's what happened in MRA studies, in our mRNA studies in the last decade or more
[34:26.920 --> 34:32.880]  is a lot of the times it's liver failure, kidney failure, heart attack, strokes.
[34:32.880 --> 34:33.880]  Simply insane.
[34:33.880 --> 34:35.600]  We're going to get to all that in a moment.
[34:35.600 --> 34:39.040]  We have a new sale we are running, and these are great products, and it also funds the
[34:39.040 --> 34:40.040]  operation.
[34:40.040 --> 34:42.320]  So it is a total 360 win in every direction.
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.320]  Folks are going to be very excited about this, and I'm very excited about it, because it's
[34:46.320 --> 34:49.920]  one of our best sellers, and it funds our operation, plus people love it, especially
[34:49.920 --> 34:51.800]  folks that have to work late at night.
[34:51.800 --> 34:52.800]  Truck drivers, you name it.
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.240]  We went to a top developer whose name is not on it, because I'm the evil Alec Jones.
[34:56.240 --> 35:03.040]  We paid a lot of money for a top sports supplement developer, with a well-known name, to give
[35:03.040 --> 35:08.080]  us the strongest, cleanest formula that nobody else had made that put the most product in
[35:08.080 --> 35:10.200]  it.
[35:10.200 --> 35:14.160]  And so this has a good price on it, but boy, does it have more product than anybody else
[35:14.160 --> 35:15.160]  we know of?
[35:15.160 --> 35:16.160]  Absolutely.
[35:16.160 --> 35:20.880]  This is high-end product that you don't pay the high-end price for.
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.200]  Turboforce is 10 hours of clean energy for your metabolic system and alertness.
[35:26.200 --> 35:32.720]  It's got a whole bunch of known compounds that boost alertness, focus, and so much more.
[35:32.720 --> 35:38.360]  And it's also got five different types of naturally occurring caffeine that release
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.040]  at different time intervals.
[35:42.040 --> 35:48.480]  And so this really is 10-hour clean energy without the big come-down, and folks know
[35:48.480 --> 35:49.480]  I don't hype things up.
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.920]  It's such a popular product, but because the breakdown in the supply chain, it's been
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.080]  sold out for, as you know, four plus months.
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.560]  And that's what's endangering InfoWars, is why you hear sponsors on the air now.
[36:00.560 --> 36:04.120]  That's why we're selling other products now, which are great, like the InfoWars phone
[36:04.120 --> 36:05.120]  and things.
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.720]  That phone says, we can fund ourselves with the supplements and t-shirts and films and
[36:09.720 --> 36:12.160]  books and water filters and stuff.
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.000]  But we can't get a lot of the supplements now because of the supply chain breakdown.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.840]  But that's a whole other story, as you know, dealing with the economy, and they're paying
[36:19.840 --> 36:22.760]  billions of people not to work still.
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.720]  So you have more money in the economy, but less products, that causes scarcity and prices
[36:26.720 --> 36:27.720]  to go up.
[36:27.720 --> 36:28.720]  This has all been planned.
[36:28.720 --> 36:29.720]  It's a great reset.
[36:29.720 --> 36:30.720]  You don't have nothing.
[36:30.720 --> 36:31.720]  You'll own nothing.
[36:31.720 --> 36:32.720]  You'll like it.
[36:32.720 --> 36:34.480]  So just thank God we got the shipment in.
[36:34.480 --> 36:35.480]  It's back.
[36:35.480 --> 36:36.480]  We really appreciate your support.
[36:36.480 --> 36:38.640]  40% off.
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.480]  Also what's back in, ultimate fish oil, highest grade fish oil at a low price.
[36:43.480 --> 36:45.440]  Even crappy grade fish oil is great for it.
[36:45.440 --> 36:49.280]  This has the expensive process of having any mercury that's in it taken out.
[36:49.280 --> 36:50.800]  This is great for adults, great for children.
[36:50.800 --> 36:52.480]  It's so good for your heart, your brain.
[36:52.480 --> 36:53.480]  It's back in stock.
[36:53.480 --> 36:57.840]  And yes, back in stock, 50% off.
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.120]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen, we're so excited about that.
[37:01.120 --> 37:04.280]  Alternate krill oil is selling out, but it's still 25% off.
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.240]  Get the two together for 50% off in the combo.
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.160]  Winter sun is close to selling out in the next few weeks, but more is coming in in a
[37:11.160 --> 37:12.160]  month and a half.
[37:12.160 --> 37:17.120]  So I'm going to sell it to boost your immune system at 50% off.
[37:17.120 --> 37:21.920]  Survival Shield X2, winter sun, all storeable foods, 10% off until next Wednesday, and then
[37:21.920 --> 37:24.720]  that sale has to end with all the craziness going on.
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.480]  The Bloomberg Food Agri-index up to 76% by the end of summer.
[37:28.480 --> 37:31.400]  If I was you, I would get storeable food, insurance you can eat.
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.040]  That's how you beat inflation today.
[37:34.040 --> 37:43.240]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139, and all t-shirts are still 17, 76.
[37:43.240 --> 37:48.920]  But let me just play a few of these clips right now because this is very illustrative.
[37:48.920 --> 37:54.040]  Here is Governor Cuomo, over half the state's deaths were sending sick people with different
[37:54.040 --> 37:59.800]  diseases, different communicable diseases, pneumonia, flu, calling it COVID.
[37:59.800 --> 38:00.800]  Some did have COVID.
[38:00.800 --> 38:01.800]  COVID is real.
[38:01.800 --> 38:06.720]  It's a very spreadable pneumonia, and it's got a protein that attacks the heart.
[38:06.720 --> 38:09.400]  But if you have vitamins and minerals in you at high levels, it can't do anything to you.
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.400]  That's what science shows.
[38:10.400 --> 38:11.400]  But they don't want you knowing that.
[38:11.400 --> 38:15.720]  They want you scared, taking their vaccines, and perpetually sick, or their gene therapies.
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.440]  Here he is saying, just load all the students up and just take them to a sports stadium,
[38:20.440 --> 38:23.360]  and then, of course, intimidate them into taking the deadly vaccine.
[38:23.360 --> 38:26.080]  So the murderer of old people isn't content.
[38:26.080 --> 38:28.080]  He wants to ruin these young people's lives as well.
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.080]  Here it is.
[38:29.080 --> 38:34.240]  We're working very hard to get to younger people, incentives for younger people.
[38:34.240 --> 38:42.160]  I've asked high schools to organize events where they drive their students to a mass
[38:42.160 --> 38:48.760]  vaccination site, put them on a bus, and bring them to a mass vaccination site.
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.040]  Because that is the population that we need to vaccinate.
[38:53.040 --> 38:58.880]  The doubtful, the hesitant population, that's more education, more information, more education,
[38:58.880 --> 38:59.880]  more information.
[38:59.880 --> 39:06.640]  So that's another one of the paid spokesperson's who the FBI could indict any day for following
[39:06.640 --> 39:11.080]  the UN's directive to put sick people in nursing homes, and then lock the nursing homes up so
[39:11.080 --> 39:17.200]  family can't see how they're being intubated for the $53,000 for every person they intubate.
[39:17.200 --> 39:18.200]  That's quite a bounty.
[39:18.200 --> 39:21.400]  You can hire top hit men for $53,000.
[39:21.400 --> 39:28.320]  $53,000 for every person you speak of who to lead to in the new guillotine of the left.
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.520]  So he's a totally compromised individual.
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.400]  Here's another compromised individual.
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.480]  Joe Biden yesterday does not know what planet he's on.
[39:36.480 --> 39:39.120]  Now he can't even read off a teleprompter.
[39:39.120 --> 39:40.720]  Here it is.
[39:40.720 --> 39:56.600]  Vaccines.com.gov, vaccines.com, or text your zip code to 438829, 438829.
[39:56.600 --> 40:01.880]  Coming up, Fauci basically admits that they're going to turn all the summer camps in America
[40:01.880 --> 40:04.280]  into brainwashing prison camps.
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.520]  All the children must stay many feet apart, and you've got to wear a mask all summer long.
[40:10.520 --> 40:13.600]  But wait, the CDC said don't wear a mask outside.
[40:13.600 --> 40:14.720]  It doesn't matter.
[40:14.720 --> 40:15.720]  They're not even God.
[40:15.720 --> 40:20.320]  Fauci, who ran the Wuhan lab and works with Bill Gates and the Chinese communists, he
[40:20.320 --> 40:23.400]  is your Lord.
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.560]  So the answer is don't go to the summer camps, don't abuse your children, tell the summer
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.000]  camps don't follow Fauci's garbage or my child's not going there.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.240]  Put your weight on them.
[40:32.240 --> 40:35.960]  The public schools, the private schools can't get in to see your kids now.
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.040]  It's all the bureaucracies with a wish list of control they want to be able to kill your
[40:41.040 --> 40:42.920]  old folks, lock your kids up.
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.640]  They're turning us all into prisoners while we're on lockdown.
[40:46.640 --> 40:48.160]  Lockdown's a prison term.
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.160]  Come on, folks.
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.640]  It's all in your face.
[40:51.640 --> 40:52.640]  Don't be helpless.
[40:52.640 --> 40:53.640]  Stand up, say no.
[40:53.640 --> 40:56.640]  You'll be back with Gregory's powerful report on the Illuminati.
[40:56.640 --> 41:01.640]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.400]  their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.360]  we've given the globalists one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.840]  And I know some of our blisters get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[41:13.840 --> 41:14.840]  a break.
[41:14.840 --> 41:15.840]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[41:15.840 --> 41:19.640]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[41:19.640 --> 41:20.640]  is so clear.
[41:20.640 --> 41:21.640]  And I get it.
[41:21.640 --> 41:24.360]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off
[41:24.360 --> 41:29.480]  by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them.
[41:29.480 --> 41:35.760]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[41:35.760 --> 41:36.760]  essential.
[41:36.760 --> 41:41.480]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[41:41.480 --> 41:43.320]  And so that's what M-Full Wars is really all about.
[41:43.320 --> 41:44.880]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[41:44.880 --> 41:48.520]  Thank you for spreading the word about M-Full Wars, and thank you for supporting us to keep
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.000]  us on air by visiting M-FullWarsStore.com, because without your daily and weekly monthly
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.800]  purchases, we'll be taken off the air.
[41:54.800 --> 41:56.800]  So thank you for the support, M-FullWarsStore.com.
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.280]  Fourteen months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses,
[42:02.280 --> 42:04.080]  the third world dies.
[42:04.080 --> 42:08.840]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you
[42:08.840 --> 42:14.000]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.480]  and really hurt the first world.
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.880]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, and that's because
[42:19.880 --> 42:24.240]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before delivering
[42:24.240 --> 42:25.880]  gas have been shut down.
[42:25.880 --> 42:29.320]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline has been shut down along with other pipelines.
[42:29.320 --> 42:32.800]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[42:32.800 --> 42:33.960]  We're being shut down.
[42:33.960 --> 42:36.080]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[42:36.080 --> 42:38.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.320]  The third world is imploding as well.
[42:40.320 --> 42:41.320]  The borders have been removed.
[42:41.320 --> 42:45.640]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have,
[42:45.640 --> 42:46.640]  no hope.
[42:46.640 --> 42:51.520]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[42:51.520 --> 42:55.000]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.800]  and your family.
[42:58.800 --> 43:04.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.160]  most of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[43:07.160 --> 43:09.880]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[43:09.880 --> 43:13.680]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[43:13.680 --> 43:16.120]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.560]  That's why in full wars, it's in financial trouble, is because if we had the product,
[43:19.560 --> 43:20.560]  you would be buying it.
[43:20.560 --> 43:21.560]  We have the money.
[43:21.560 --> 43:24.920]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed a lot of other items at the
[43:24.920 --> 43:29.000]  store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[43:29.000 --> 43:35.360]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential
[43:35.360 --> 43:36.360]  in your body.
[43:36.360 --> 43:37.360]  It's really the missing link.
[43:37.360 --> 43:38.360]  It's 50% off.
[43:38.360 --> 43:41.360]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.160]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[43:45.160 --> 43:49.440]  of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to
[43:49.440 --> 43:51.600]  forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[43:51.600 --> 43:55.320]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[43:55.320 --> 43:56.320]  It's essential.
[43:56.320 --> 43:58.840]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[43:58.840 --> 44:05.280]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.480]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world.
[44:09.480 --> 44:15.920]  It's known as the Builder for Earth, but their objective being world domination.
[44:15.920 --> 44:19.200]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[44:19.200 --> 44:24.280]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[44:24.280 --> 44:27.400]  80% of humanity is in hand.
[44:27.400 --> 44:30.040]  The globalist feared this film made 14 years ago.
[44:30.040 --> 44:32.280]  It is the blueprint for their plan to figure out the world.
[44:32.280 --> 44:33.760]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[44:33.760 --> 44:34.760]  It is in-game.
[44:34.760 --> 44:39.280]  Blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com with a zero country
[44:39.280 --> 44:41.920]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[44:41.920 --> 44:46.120]  I strongly suggest you get the film in-game at infowarstore.com.
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.400]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it, and if you take that action, I demand
[44:50.400 --> 44:53.920]  you tell others you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it as well.
[44:53.920 --> 45:01.120]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[45:01.120 --> 45:17.160]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[45:17.160 --> 45:27.360]  Well, Ben Shapiro's sister on her own, Twitter says she took the mRNA vaccine and had a miscarriage.
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.480]  Well, that's taken one for the globalist team, really sorry for her and her dead baby.
[45:31.480 --> 45:34.480]  Get an article out on that at infowarstore.com.
[45:34.480 --> 45:42.080]  Well, here is the premiere of a very important piece of information that will be posted as
[45:42.080 --> 45:46.840]  soon as we transmit this and premiere it out to all these radio and TV stations.
[45:46.840 --> 45:53.840]  This is Greg Reese's latest piece on the secrets of the Illuminati revealed in the mindset
[45:53.840 --> 46:00.560]  the operating system of these selfish demons Lucifer, son of the morning, is that he who
[46:00.560 --> 46:04.600]  bears the light doubt it not.
[46:04.600 --> 46:07.960]  That's the beginning of their big secret.
[46:07.960 --> 46:15.960]  God is the devil and we're already in hell right now.
[46:15.960 --> 46:21.280]  Altion Jurick, best known as Altion Childs, is an Australian performer who topped the
[46:21.280 --> 46:26.880]  charts after winning the second season of X Factor Australia in 2010.
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.200]  On April 15 of this year, Altion published a five hour video claiming he was initiated
[46:32.200 --> 46:39.120]  into the Freemasons and that Freemasonry is hiding the true world religion, Satanism.
[46:39.120 --> 46:44.240]  He goes on to reveal how every initiate must swear a vow of secrecy to never reveal the
[46:44.240 --> 46:49.680]  secrets of Freemasonry to anyone whatsoever under penalty of having their body severed
[46:49.680 --> 46:56.320]  in two and their bowels burned to ashes, their throat slit and their tongue torn out by the
[46:56.320 --> 46:57.320]  roots.
[46:57.320 --> 47:02.080]  This is the sign you do upon entering and exiting the ritual room while facing the grandmaster.
[47:02.080 --> 47:06.600]  It stands for throat slit and it goes like this.
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.480]  They use symbolic gestures to flaunt their secret religion such as the sign of the master
[47:12.480 --> 47:19.080]  of the second veil or the hidden hand, the sign of silence.
[47:19.080 --> 47:24.120]  As you move up the ranks of Freemasonry, the oaths of silence for taking each degree become
[47:24.120 --> 47:29.080]  more brutal, having your heart torn out and fed to wild beasts.
[47:29.080 --> 47:34.640]  Your head struck off and placed on the highest spire of Christendom, destroying your business
[47:34.640 --> 47:40.000]  and reputation and hanging you in your own home.
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.680]  Masonic rules clearly stipulate that the Lodge has the authority and obligation to uphold
[47:44.680 --> 47:49.640]  these mandates and penalize any member who violates them.
[47:49.640 --> 47:54.200]  Masonic rules also warn members from inviting the vulgar and profane.
[47:54.200 --> 48:00.840]  The profane is what they call the uninitiated, anyone outside their secret order.
[48:00.840 --> 48:06.880]  As one climbs the ladder of power and Freemasonry, each degree requires more barbaric acts from
[48:06.880 --> 48:08.380]  the initiate.
[48:08.380 --> 48:15.440]  From being humiliated and stepped on, drinking wine from a human skull, stabbing human skulls.
[48:15.440 --> 48:20.200]  And in one of the highest degrees, the initiate removes a blindfold to find a severed human
[48:20.200 --> 48:23.560]  head lying on the floor with a bloody knife beside it.
[48:23.560 --> 48:28.000]  He is instructed to take the knife in his right hand and the head in his left.
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.560]  Eventually, this leads the initiate to accept human sacrifice as a right of initiation,
[48:34.560 --> 48:38.640]  which is the ultimate goal of this unholy hierarchy.
[48:38.640 --> 48:46.640]  33rd degree Mason, Maly P. Hall, who was named Freemason of the Century, wrote that Freemasonry
[48:46.640 --> 48:53.440]  is a religion and that initiates are intentionally misled until they reach the highest levels.
[48:53.440 --> 49:00.760]  He wrote that Freemasonry is an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood, one visible
[49:00.760 --> 49:02.360]  and one invisible.
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.440]  The invisible is dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcanum arcanorum.
[49:08.440 --> 49:14.080]  Having a belief in a supreme being is required to become a mason, and the atheist is looked
[49:14.080 --> 49:19.040]  upon by the mason as being the most vulgar and despicable of mankind.
[49:19.040 --> 49:21.920]  But who is the supreme being in Masonry?
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.040]  Freemasonry is Satanism in disguise.
[49:26.040 --> 49:31.920]  33rd degree sovereign grand commander of the Scottish Rite, Albert Pike, wrote in Morals
[49:31.920 --> 49:35.680]  and Dogma that Lucifer is the light bearer.
[49:35.680 --> 49:44.280]  33rd degree Mason, Albert Mackey, wrote that Lucifer is good, light, victory, and initiation.
[49:44.280 --> 49:49.360]  And 33rd degree Freemason of the Century, Maly P. Hall, wrote that the mystery of the
[49:49.360 --> 49:56.160]  craft is the seething, surging energies of Lucifer that can be wielded by the initiate.
[49:56.160 --> 50:01.600]  This is the symbol for Satanism, and this is the symbol for female Freemasonry, the
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.400]  Order of the Eastern Star.
[50:04.400 --> 50:09.960]  The Satanic Bible lists Baphomet as the symbol of Satan worshipped by the highest level of
[50:09.960 --> 50:13.560]  Freemasonry, the Templar Masons.
[50:13.560 --> 50:17.720]  In the Satanic rituals, it is written that Masonic orders contain the most influential
[50:17.720 --> 50:23.880]  men in government, and virtually every occult order has Masonic roots, and that every rite
[50:23.880 --> 50:29.320]  of the Nazi's black order employed Masonic principles.
[50:29.320 --> 50:35.840]  Both Satanism and Masonic rituals involve the goat, the coffin, and the death's head.
[50:35.840 --> 50:41.000]  Anton Leves wrote that the Masonic rituals serve as a screening process for organized
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.800]  Satanism.
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.000]  Freemasons can also be seen making the 666 hand gesture.
[50:48.000 --> 50:53.840]  I'm a Christian, sir.
[50:53.840 --> 50:56.320]  I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent.
[50:56.320 --> 50:59.400]  How can you say anything to buy it about me?
[50:59.400 --> 51:01.040]  Sir, you need to be born again.
[51:01.040 --> 51:02.040]  I am born again.
[51:02.040 --> 51:04.120]  Now, did you just say that you were Lucifer?
[51:04.120 --> 51:05.120]  I am Lucifer.
[51:05.120 --> 51:06.960]  Okay, define Lucifer for me.
[51:06.960 --> 51:11.840]  Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's ought to help people.
[51:11.840 --> 51:12.840]  Lucifer is?
[51:12.840 --> 51:13.840]  Yeah.
[51:13.840 --> 51:14.840]  Say that again.
[51:14.840 --> 51:16.520]  Lucifer is a pure, holy...
[51:16.520 --> 51:17.520]  Virtuous.
[51:17.520 --> 51:18.520]  Virtuous.
[51:18.520 --> 51:20.520]  Now, see the Lucifer that got created?
[51:20.520 --> 51:21.520]  That's the same one.
[51:21.520 --> 51:27.320]  At the highest level of the so-called Illuminati is a perverted sex cult, which is why high
[51:27.320 --> 51:34.760]  level Mason Walt Disney not only saturated his films with Masonic hand gestures and 666,
[51:34.760 --> 51:40.240]  but also added subliminal images with hidden sexuality.
[51:40.240 --> 51:45.080]  Altion claims that the square and compass are actually symbolizing the sex act.
[51:45.080 --> 51:49.000]  The woman's legs spread open and a man mounting her.
[51:49.000 --> 51:53.480]  The G symbolizes the generative principle of creation.
[51:53.480 --> 51:57.560]  The all-seeing eye symbolizes the head of the penis.
[51:57.560 --> 52:01.360]  And the ray shooting forth the orgasm.
[52:01.360 --> 52:07.280]  Each year, 13 high-level masons may be invited to join the top of this monstrous pyramid,
[52:07.280 --> 52:13.160]  the royal order of gestures, dedicated to nothing but sexual depravity.
[52:13.160 --> 52:16.920]  There is no sin, there is only nature.
[52:16.920 --> 52:22.720]  Why do you think that witchcraft has disappeared?
[52:22.720 --> 52:23.720]  It never disappeared.
[52:23.720 --> 52:31.840]  It was hidden, forced to go into hiding by the appearance of Jesus on the human scene.
[52:31.840 --> 52:34.240]  Another reason why he's passionately hated.
[52:34.240 --> 52:40.000]  33rd degree Mason Aleister Crowley wrote how he pecks at the eyes of Jesus on the cross,
[52:40.000 --> 52:41.000]  how the new age will arise...
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.120]  All right, the full report has got three minutes left, and it's very good, and it's
[52:45.120 --> 52:49.480]  posted at band.video, and I want you to go there and I want you to share it.
[52:49.480 --> 52:52.800]  And this report is extremely accurate, everything in it is very accurate.
[52:52.800 --> 52:56.400]  But look at what I have on this table right here, and that's why I put this there about
[52:56.400 --> 53:00.480]  six months ago as a message to the globalist, I guess about eight months ago now, rep for
[53:00.480 --> 53:02.480]  whole campaign.
[53:02.480 --> 53:04.200]  Because to them, that's a blasphemous symbol.
[53:04.200 --> 53:10.640]  It's a dagger and a skull, but then the symbol of, I think, Christ's eternal life, or those
[53:10.640 --> 53:11.640]  wings.
[53:11.640 --> 53:17.600]  It's a message that the Holy Spirit is in control of life and death, and not them.
[53:17.600 --> 53:22.440]  And that the clock is ticking down, and that they're not immortal, they're going to face
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.440]  the Great Judgment.
[53:23.440 --> 53:26.720]  Now, only one of those higher level Masons would know what that means, but I want to
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.800]  be very specific here.
[53:28.800 --> 53:35.680]  This all goes back to the Babylonian, Christian religions, Egypt, Greece, and the Solomon's
[53:35.680 --> 53:36.680]  Temple.
[53:36.680 --> 53:40.720]  And there's different arms of the Masons, so some will say, well, George Washington was
[53:40.720 --> 53:44.680]  a Christian, which he was, but he was in the Scottish Rite.
[53:44.680 --> 53:51.320]  And so the whole Hollywood angle of Masons and the whole modern Aleister Crowley system
[53:51.320 --> 53:56.240]  has been taken over by the Satanic orders that were inside the Masonic system.
[53:56.240 --> 54:00.920]  And of course, that goes back to right before 1776 and Adam Visop, who sought to take over
[54:00.920 --> 54:01.920]  the Masonic orders.
[54:01.920 --> 54:08.680]  Now, the Masonic orders back to the time of Solomon had a Satanic vein, and Solomon was
[54:08.680 --> 54:12.880]  conjuring demons, and that's what the Star of David is really, the Seal of Solomon and
[54:12.880 --> 54:14.160]  all of that.
[54:14.160 --> 54:20.800]  And so this goes all the way back pre-Christianity to Egypt, mainly, and then Babylon and Greece
[54:20.800 --> 54:22.320]  after that.
[54:22.320 --> 54:27.320]  And of course, the Sumerian text, and really, it's all of that knowledge and ancient science
[54:27.320 --> 54:33.120]  and alchemy was held by Masons, and so it's a college of secret knowledge.
[54:33.120 --> 54:41.800]  It becomes a modern Christian view of it, that it is always and totally a Satanic enterprise,
[54:41.800 --> 54:45.680]  and it's true that it has become a Satanic enterprise because Masonry has been taken
[54:45.680 --> 54:49.880]  over at the top by Satanists, and if you knew this and done research, you'd know that George
[54:49.880 --> 54:54.080]  Washington wrote dozens of letters that are in the National Archives that you can read
[54:54.080 --> 54:59.000]  online, you can actually see his text, where he warned of the Illuminati and the Satanists
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.160]  taking over Masonry and that it was an absolutely terrible thing that was happening.
[55:03.160 --> 55:07.680]  So people can ask me how I like George Washington, but reports out like this, well, we'll have
[55:07.680 --> 55:11.920]  a part two report, there's Colonel Aquino, and these Satanists are a joke, ladies and
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.280]  gentlemen, but they infest things, they take over all these ancient orders, and now all
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.280]  the mystery schools are run by them, because again, the mystery schools are not Christian,
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.320]  they predate Christ, they predate Judaism, they are the original system.
[55:25.320 --> 55:31.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will go to break, we will come back and we will start
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.640]  our number two.
[55:32.640 --> 55:39.760]  I am Alexander Emerick Jones, your tour guide as we go into the wormhole that is the rabbit
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.320]  hole and beyond and back again.
[55:43.320 --> 55:47.080]  Stay with us, our number two with Dr. Joseph McCullough, straight ahead.
[55:47.080 --> 55:51.600]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist,
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.160]  the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but
[55:56.160 --> 56:00.000]  the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegor.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.760]  Turbo force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.200]  natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[56:09.200 --> 56:10.960]  system, metabolism of a human.
[56:10.960 --> 56:14.240]  Some people get 15 hours out of it, some people get about eight hours, but people take this,
[56:14.240 --> 56:17.720]  people are taking sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had, because it's
[56:17.720 --> 56:23.840]  not high, nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you
[56:23.840 --> 56:27.360]  can call us whatever you want, it's a total solution, all around the best you're going
[56:27.360 --> 56:28.360]  to find.
[56:28.360 --> 56:33.000]  Turbo force, without you we don't roll, with you we search forward together, it's like
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.720]  a bulldozer without the diesel fuel, if we don't have your financial support we will
[56:36.720 --> 56:39.760]  be defeated, you support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your
[56:39.760 --> 56:48.920]  body and your mind, it's a win-win, 360 together, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[56:48.920 --> 56:51.920]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[56:51.920 --> 56:52.920]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.280]  I would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason, and amongst all
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.240]  this stupidity, wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year,
[57:01.240 --> 57:08.360]  okay, I'm a double amputee, and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away,
[57:08.360 --> 57:13.640]  living defense saved my life, they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed
[57:13.640 --> 57:19.480]  me, living defense brought me back, I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying
[57:19.480 --> 57:25.640]  as to where we are right now, this is Matthew 24, verse 9, then they shall deliver you up
[57:25.640 --> 57:32.520]  to be afflicted, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's
[57:32.520 --> 57:38.360]  sake, and then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one
[57:38.360 --> 57:39.360]  another.
[57:39.360 --> 57:40.360]  That's right where we're at brother.
[57:40.360 --> 57:44.640]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country, no matter what they say,
[57:44.640 --> 57:52.280]  and that's why the enemy hates it, because God created this country.
[57:52.280 --> 58:14.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, Zuckerberg hates America, what you are doing with your
[58:14.800 --> 58:24.840]  power that you have derived, because federal law gave you the ability to stand up and grow
[58:24.840 --> 58:33.400]  without being hit by lawsuits, you have used this power to act like you hold all the power,
[58:33.400 --> 58:39.400]  that you can make these decisions, you have driven this cancel culture.
[58:39.400 --> 58:45.840]  He despises the country that nurtured his ability to make 12 million dollars every day
[58:45.840 --> 58:52.080]  of the calendar year by monopolizing America's First Amendment in order to lure people to
[58:52.080 --> 58:58.520]  share their private lives to the world and low level hackers.
[58:58.520 --> 59:04.960]  I know that we don't exactly have the strongest reputation on privacy right now to put it
[59:04.960 --> 59:05.960]  lightly.
[59:05.960 --> 59:14.760]  Exposed data includes the personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106
[59:14.760 --> 59:20.240]  countries, including over 32 million records on users in the United States.
[59:20.240 --> 59:27.000]  It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birth dates, bios,
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.640]  and in some cases even email addresses, according to Business Insider, serving a black market
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.920]  where sharing family pictures leads to your savings being wiped out.
[59:38.920 --> 59:45.000]  Through numerous hearings, Zuckerberg has presented himself as a conscientious crusader,
[59:45.000 --> 59:50.480]  protecting the pseudo values of the digitally distracted millennial generation.
[59:50.480 --> 59:54.040]  Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company.
[59:54.040 --> 59:59.360]  For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do.
[59:59.360 --> 1:00:03.920]  And as Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying
[1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:09.800]  connected to the people they love, for making their voices heard, and for building communities
[1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.680]  and businesses.
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:16.120]  Just recently, we've seen the Me Too movement and the march for our lives organized at least
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.040]  in part on Facebook.
[1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:24.000]  But Zuckerberg is merely a cog in the New World Order elitist cabal's wheel whose unchecked
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:31.280]  avarice has revealed true dark intentions as he rapes the ancestral land of Hawaii's
[1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.400]  oldest island, Kauai.
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:40.240]  So now a billionaire comes in with his money, doing it by force, removing people out of
[1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:41.240]  their land.
[1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.920]  It's one thing to want to protect your property, it's another when native Hawaiians like Shen
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:47.440]  and Buckner still own pieces of your land.
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:50.720]  So the land that you own is just across the fence right here?
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:51.720]  Yes.
[1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:55.000]  And as Zuckerberg has put up this wall and fence and it says no trespassing?
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  Yes.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  What would happen if he tried to go over there?
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.240]  I'll get arrested for trespassing.
[1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:00.640]  Even though it's your land.
[1:01:00.640 --> 1:01:01.640]  Yep.
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:06.280]  And as Zuckerberg foolishly taunts the curse of Hawaiians' ancestors.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:07.280]  You want it?
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:08.280]  Sure, why not?
[1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:09.280]  It'll make a great souvenir.
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:10.280]  Okay, take it.
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.280]  Bad luck.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:16.280]  Come and get me.
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:25.720]  Facebook, in league with the treasonous Mockingbird media, vomit out propaganda against a former
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.760]  president of the United States.
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:33.680]  As NBC's headline declares, Trump's Facebook account should never be reinstated because
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:35.720]  we know what he'd use it for.
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:41.840]  The former president used social media as a propaganda tool to try to undermine American
[1:01:41.840 --> 1:01:42.840]  democracy.
[1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:46.480]  Of course, he'd do so again if given the opportunity.
[1:01:46.480 --> 1:01:51.520]  NBC's headline ironically undermines American democracy.
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:57.120]  Forbidding the use of a former president's First Amendment rights is treasonous.
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:03.240]  But NBC continues to stomp its boot on America's face forever, stating Facebook's oversight
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:08.760]  board will announce whether former President Donald Trump will once again be allowed to
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:13.960]  post on that company's platforms, which include both Facebook and Instagram.
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:19.520]  The company first took down a video and post from Trump, then suspended the then president's
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:23.120]  accounts for 24 hours on January 6th.
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:28.880]  CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote that the risks of allowing the president to continue to use
[1:02:28.880 --> 1:02:32.840]  our service during this period are simply too great.
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:33.840]  That's right.
[1:02:33.840 --> 1:02:38.680]  I shot a video last night predicting that the ADL run board would continue the ban of
[1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:41.080]  the 45th president, and they indeed did that.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:42.840]  See the full report at banned.video.
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:48.400]  Zuckerberg hates America, he doesn't just hate America, he's absorbing America.
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:51.800]  And now the ADL is spying on everything you do through Facebook.
[1:02:51.800 --> 1:02:52.800]  Wow.
[1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:57.240]  We'll be right back.
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:00.200]  I one trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:02.000]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.480]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[1:03:03.480 --> 1:03:05.800]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:06.800]  That's embarrassing.
[1:03:06.800 --> 1:03:10.920]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me, but I'll tell you this
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:11.920]  right now.
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.360]  You're nuts if you don't get storeable food, and I've got the biggest, best sponsor with
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:19.280]  the highest quality food and the lowest price you're going to find.
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:24.160]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get like gourmet stuff that takes even better?
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:25.160]  Yeah.
[1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:26.160]  Most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:27.160]  Some of it tastes okay.
[1:03:27.160 --> 1:03:30.800]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:34.320]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:38.040]  They've got three months, six months, your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:44.680]  so hard to give you 10 percent off again because you're so conditionally buying your supercell.
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:46.840]  We're doing it one more time.
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:54.360]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, 10 percent off the entire catalog of my favorite supply.
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:04:00.080]  Get ready while you still can.
[1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:06.840]  Waging War on Corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:09.840]  the Infowar.
[1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:18.080]  Well, Dr. Joseph Merkola joins us today, and I appreciate him having the time as busy as
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:19.080]  can be to do that.
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:25.080]  It could be a more important topic of free speech and medical rights and consumer rights.
[1:04:25.080 --> 1:04:30.000]  He's a medical doctor, I'm not going to go over his whole bio, but he is the guy in
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.800]  the 90s that led the fight to basically keep the right for us to have supplements legal
[1:04:34.800 --> 1:04:39.720]  and barely draw the law in place that protected it somewhat when they were going to ban it
[1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:40.720]  all.
[1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:44.480]  It's safe to say we wouldn't be in the position we're in to even be able to fight back against
[1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:45.480]  this during now.
[1:04:45.480 --> 1:04:46.480]  It wasn't for Merkola.
[1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:52.280]  I'd call him the great grandfather of the modern health and wellness movement.
[1:04:52.280 --> 1:04:57.840]  And Merkola.com is his site, but unlike some of the other people that like founded Whole
[1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:02.040]  Foods and others, he has not sold out to the system.
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:07.680]  Stop COVID cold.com is his site, and he made an announcement yesterday, a big article
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:08.680]  at Merkola.com.
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:14.120]  It's also on Infowars.com, why I'm removing all articles related to Vitamin D, C, Zinc,
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:15.120]  and COVID-19.
[1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:20.880]  And we're going to repost that article in the live show feed, under the live show feed.
[1:05:20.880 --> 1:05:24.000]  You can read it because it has the groups, it has the organizations.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:28.240]  The disinformation does, and this is funded by consortium of Bill and Melinda Gates groups,
[1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:34.320]  and they actually called the CIA and FBI to use anti-terrorism actions against folks.
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.720]  They have 20 attorney generals of states saying shut us down.
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:42.160]  Well, he was willing to stand against that, but new developments happened, threats happened
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:46.480]  to him and his family that were so specific, he said that at this point he's going to remove
[1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:50.860]  the information about zinc, D, and other things that even Fauci admits are true.
[1:05:50.860 --> 1:05:56.360]  So a very dark day, but, and he's not backing down from them, this is obviously strategic,
[1:05:56.360 --> 1:05:58.440]  and I think it's a cry for help, and we all have a cry for help.
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:03.920]  I mean, we're all under attack, and the way tyranny works is it slowly takes freedoms
[1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:08.360]  like the frog in the pot until you're boiling, that's what the Nazis did, the Soviets did.
[1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:09.360]  We're here today.
[1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:15.200]  We're now in a boiling pot, and you've seen Biden get on TV and say, anybody that opposes
[1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:18.360]  my agenda is a white supremacist, and you're a terrorist, we're going to have the Pentagon
[1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:22.120]  come after citizens, and you've seen Socky say that, the press secretary, and you've
[1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:28.400]  seen Nunes warn of this in closed intelligence hearings that they're rolling out a purge.
[1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:32.080]  People that just were at the Capitol didn't hurt anybody, were waved in by police, or
[1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:35.280]  in solitary confinement under the D.C.
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:40.680]  Jails, so it's a very dangerous time, and now the attempts to bully us into forced
[1:06:40.680 --> 1:06:44.520]  gene therapy, so I want to try to give Dr. Mercola for the rest of the hour the floor
[1:06:44.520 --> 1:06:48.240]  to talk about what's in his article, and I've got some questions, and then I want to get
[1:06:48.240 --> 1:06:54.160]  into the so-called vaccine and the rest of it, and what he thinks the trajectory of this
[1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:55.160]  world is.
[1:06:55.160 --> 1:07:00.880]  So Dr. Joseph Mercola, stopcovidcold.com, mercola.com, thank you so much for joining us on short
[1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:01.880]  notice.
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:05.880]  Well, thank you so much for having me give me another platform, I really appreciate
[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:07.200]  the opportunity.
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:13.680]  So it is a sad day that we are seeing the progressive decline in the Constitution, specifically
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:14.680]  the First Amendment.
[1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:22.320]  They're starting with any narrative around COVID-19, and because of the pressure that
[1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:27.320]  I've been under, we needed to remove anything that's connected to COVID-19 and supplements.
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:34.400]  So the stopcovidcold.com has been taken down also, so the only place right now is Mercola.com,
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.600]  but I've got exciting news.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:41.520]  The content that's currently removed and being censored is going to be somewhere else,
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:47.120]  but we can't disclose it at this time, but we'll in the near future on our site.
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:52.880]  And you are very wise, you picked it up with your brilliant mind that this is strategic.
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:55.720]  People don't know this is a highly strategic move.
[1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:00.760]  So we have not given up, we have not backed down, we are committed to winning this thing,
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:03.720]  and I am beyond confident that we will defeat these guys, Alex.
[1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:08.320]  Well, talk about the intimidation, because I've had it, other people have had it, a lot
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:12.800]  of friends of mine have had it, and people's wives get threatened, things like that.
[1:08:12.800 --> 1:08:16.320]  Folks need to know the level of the mafia tactics we're dealing with.
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:23.840]  Yeah, the strategy involves me not disclosing specifics because it would ruin it, so I can't
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:29.720]  really give details, but it's there, I can assure you, with a high degree of confidence.
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:36.600]  But the good news is that it's not intimidating me in any way, shape, or form, and in fact,
[1:08:36.600 --> 1:08:39.160]  the exact opposite is true.
[1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:48.640]  I'm aligning with some of the top brains and the very wealthy individuals to form something,
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:54.720]  if you've read Ayn Rand's book, The Atlas Frogged, you'll be very familiar with, which
[1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.560]  is called Sculch.
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:00.840]  So we're forming one, and it's not going to be in the United States.
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:04.720]  And we're going into, it's embryonic at this point, it's going to probably take us a few
[1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:07.640]  years to figure out a strategy, but we will defeat them.
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:10.360]  Not a micro down in my mind, not.
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:16.200]  Let's talk about 35,000 foot view, the reckless in us of bringing out decades old mRNA stuff
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:21.920]  that they can never get approved, the lying about it, the buying off hundreds of thousands
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:25.200]  of influencers, not just major media, I mean, this is a big push.
[1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:26.200]  What is this push?
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:30.280]  What are we witnessing as a medical doctor, a trailblazer that's tracked and predicted
[1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:31.280]  all this?
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:32.280]  What is this we're witnessing?
[1:09:32.280 --> 1:09:37.160]  I saw a year and a half ago in December, the UN issued an emergency report and said people
[1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:38.160]  don't believe in vaccines.
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:39.800]  Our doctors say they're hurting people.
[1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:40.800]  They're not tested.
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:43.520]  It was the director of the WHO vaccine program.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.200]  She said that we're killing people, and I think this is all a response to all that news
[1:09:48.200 --> 1:09:53.840]  coming out to just create such a big hysteria that you forget the previous crimes.
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:54.840]  What do you think it is?
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:59.520]  Well, before I answer that, I just want to mention that I have written a book on this.
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:01.400]  It's called The Truth About COVID-19.
[1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:05.120]  It was just published this week or last week, and it's brand new.
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:10.440]  It's on the best seller list on Amazon, and for now, that's the best way to get the details
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:12.920]  of this because we've had to take most of it down from our site.
[1:10:12.920 --> 1:10:14.440]  So if you want more information, I'll go in that.
[1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:15.720]  This is obviously a limited format.
[1:10:15.720 --> 1:10:17.560]  We can't go into great detail.
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:21.120]  But with respect to the vaccine, I couldn't agree with you more.
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:27.960]  I can only speculate it's my belief that this clearly has every sign of a deep topulation
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:29.760]  strategy.
[1:10:29.760 --> 1:10:31.560]  There's nothing that's good coming in this vaccine.
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:36.200]  It's my belief that ultimately this vaccine will kill more people than COVID did.
[1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:39.840]  I'm really convinced of that, and you won't know.
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:42.640]  It'll never be known because they're suppressing all the information.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:49.840]  Any time someone dies from a vaccine injury within hours, it was a coincidence, just a
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:50.840]  coincidence.
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:55.000]  Whereas, if they had a COVID-19 test that was a false positive, and they died three
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:59.200]  months later from a motorcycle accident, it's COVID-19 death.
[1:10:59.200 --> 1:11:05.960]  So these statistics are manipulated up the wazoo, and they manipulate to support the
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:10.360]  narrative that they want, which is to drive fear into the population so that they can
[1:11:10.360 --> 1:11:11.860]  push into the vaccine.
[1:11:11.860 --> 1:11:12.860]  They're not winning.
[1:11:12.860 --> 1:11:13.860]  They were not winning.
[1:11:13.860 --> 1:11:15.000]  And who's behind all of it?
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:19.800]  I think you well know, who are these front groups financed by?
[1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:24.240]  They're financed by a number of billionaires, so-called philanthropists, but one of the
[1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:25.360]  major ones is Gates.
[1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:28.000]  And you know what happened this week.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.280]  It's why petition for a divorce.
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:35.720]  So you know what that means, Alex?
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:37.440]  Tell me, doctor.
[1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:44.640]  It means we are winning because we, not only me, but a whole wide variety of other vigils
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:50.120]  have carefully exposed his fraud and corruption.
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:54.520]  We have demolished his the halo that he has created with the same strategy that John Rockefeller
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.760]  did, and he's demolished.
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.120]  He's essentially admitting victory.
[1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:03.840]  This is a very strategic move on Bill and Melinda Gates, because what they're going
[1:12:03.840 --> 1:12:09.920]  to do is going to transfer all of the information, not the information, but the wealth of the
[1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:13.840]  monopoly to her, knowing you've got a good chance of going down.
[1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:16.160]  Yeah, he's definitely down.
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:17.160]  We definitely-
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.160]  So he's the escape pod.
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  Right.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:23.800]  They're going to transfer his halo to her and the foundation, and they'll be able to
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:25.280]  continue their nefarious activities.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:26.840]  But it shows that we're winning.
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:28.400]  This is the first step.
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:29.880]  He will ultimately be crushed.
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.040]  Their whole organization will be crushed.
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:32.040]  The truth will be out.
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:33.760]  You cannot suppress the truth forever.
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:34.760]  There's no question.
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:35.760]  By the way, you're not just bragging.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:39.880]  You were instrumental with Ron Paul in the 90s, crushing their move to ban supplements.
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:40.880]  They were going to do it.
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:44.120]  Tell me, you don't just- I've never seen you so confident, and I've been interviewing
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:45.120]  you for 23 years.
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:48.120]  I don't know if it's been that long.
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:50.320]  I think it's that long.
[1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:51.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:12:51.320 --> 1:12:54.000]  So there's so many things that we can do now.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:13:01.080]  But the first one is to not be afraid, to know, to understand that the truth will prevail,
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.480]  and that you just have to continue along.
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.640]  And ultimately, we're going to come up with a plan of strategy.
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:08.600]  I don't know what that is, but I know we're going to come up with one.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.520]  So in the meantime, you can read the book Truth About COVID-19 is on Amazon or any place
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:19.200]  you like to purchase books, and it helps spread the message because it's brain-sensor.
[1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:27.000]  So if we go back, it's really interesting because I interviewed Naomi Wolf a week ago,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.200]  and last Sunday it was on our site.
[1:13:29.200 --> 1:13:30.200]  Hold on.
[1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:33.120]  I want to hear that she's another real liberal, one that really cares.
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.120]  It's truly anti-war, anti-police state and pro-medical freedom.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.120]  My body, my choice.
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:41.680]  Let's talk about your interview with Naomi Wolf when we come back, and let's talk about
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.440]  the fact that you've already won some big battles, and we can win these battles together
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:46.440]  in the future.
[1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:50.160]  Dr. Joseph Merkola is our guest, and he will also give you some history of Bill Gates.
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:51.160]  He's an expert on that.
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:52.160]  Stay with us.
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:59.720]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person, and so as bad as things are with
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:03.480]  the globalist attack on humanity and all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:07.920]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:11.480]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things the general public doesn't get to see, and
[1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:17.120]  let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress, or even folks in Hollywood
[1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:22.960]  or mainstream media or industry, people are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  They don't want to go along with the globalists, but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:30.560]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.
[1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:34.920]  You fund us, you support M4.com, you get great products at the same time.
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:39.480]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular, what the globalists will
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:44.720]  target you for, to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:50.040]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet
[1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:52.480]  the shock groups and the information war.
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:55.360]  Fund us at M4store.com.
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:58.160]  The equation is very simple.
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:04.760]  The bank of banks control the media, they control big pharma, they control academia, they control
[1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:10.200]  the military, industrial complex, they control big tech, and everywhere that they have been
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:18.000]  in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:23.600]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:26.520]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:32.040]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted, turned it upside
[1:15:32.040 --> 1:15:39.520]  down, and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:42.280]  that threatens their monopoly of control.
[1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:46.400]  That's why they target info wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:52.040]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:57.920]  So redouble your efforts, we're all in this together.
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:06.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:20.880]  All right, Dr. Mercola has been a trailblazer fighting for our medical rights, our health
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:24.000]  rights, and of course he was telling me during the break, he said, look, try to give me credit
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  for stuff.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.760]  I really wasn't an instrumental in it, but I was an instrumental in it, and it's important
[1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.640]  to know the victories we've had, I'm not just heaping morals here, is that he spearheaded
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:37.040]  exposing Monsanto back when they would sue you, they would attack you, Bayer would attack
[1:16:37.040 --> 1:16:40.800]  you, four-round up the Glyphosate, which they now confirm.
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:44.480]  All the world causes cancer, they lied about it, said you could drink it, ended farmers
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:51.720]  commit suicide with it, and now another settlement, $10.6 billion announced today with Bayer that
[1:16:51.720 --> 1:16:54.480]  was just one division selling Glyphosate.
[1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:58.440]  So I know that's ancient history, but briefly talk about that victory and why you're targeted
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:02.640]  by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation openly saying they want to use the CIA on you like
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:03.640]  a terrorist.
[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  That's an actual quote.
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:09.560]  Yeah, they want to use, Peter Hotez, who's gotten tens of millions of dollars in funding
[1:17:09.560 --> 1:17:17.120]  from Bill Gates Foundation, was allowed to publish an article in the most prestigious
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:21.840]  journal, one of the most prestigious journals in the world, Nature, and he calls for cyberwar
[1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:26.040]  warfare or for the anti-vaxxers because this is too important a thing, even though no one's
[1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:32.480]  broken any law where all we're doing is exercising our First Amendment freedom of choice principles
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:33.720]  and freedom of speech.
[1:17:33.720 --> 1:17:37.720]  So it's just shocking that they go to this level, but they're pulling out all guns to
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:40.840]  suppress information and freedom.
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.680]  And by the way, you sent me some articles.
[1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:51.120]  They say in here, don't let people say that deficiency of zinc, vitamin D and C is a big
[1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:55.080]  cause of viruses hurting people, it's a fact, but you sent me an article where Fauci had
[1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:56.080]  to admit it.
[1:17:56.080 --> 1:18:00.400]  I mean, so you're literally saying that water is wet and the sky is blue and they're saying
[1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:02.120]  we need to use the Pentagon on you.
[1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:06.120]  Yeah, it's classic illustration of double-speak and a disinformation campaign.
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:11.520]  They're just essentially, what's up is down and down and what's right is left.
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:13.920]  I mean, it's just insane what they're doing.
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:20.880]  I had a peer-reviewed article that was a complete review of the immunological effects of impact
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:26.520]  of vitamin D on infectious diseases, including COVID, and it was rejected like four or five
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:29.280]  times from what a very prestigious journal called Nutrients.
[1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:30.280]  And that was published.
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:36.160]  I was also co-authors with William Grant and Carol Wagner, who are very profoundly expert
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:40.200]  recognized vitamin D research, and they've edited it like crazy and it was good.
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.360]  And I can't even publish that.
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:45.640]  It's like, what more proof can you have?
[1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:51.600]  You're suppressing all the valid signs that anything that disagrees with their narrative,
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:59.120]  which essentially supports the fear to drive people to the vaccine, which is going to not
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:01.920]  result in a good outcome for people.
[1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:03.280]  And you know what's interesting, Alex?
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:06.920]  Last, not last weekend, but the weekend before last, the CDC came out and had one of the
[1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:09.880]  most egregious recommendations they ever made.
[1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:13.760]  They recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for pregnant women.
[1:19:13.760 --> 1:19:19.960]  And even in the RIG safety trial studies that were grossly abbreviated, there was never
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:21.680]  any pregnant women in the trial.
[1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:27.840]  And we know that just basic precautionary principles, you never give unproven, untested
[1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:31.320]  therapeutic interventions to pregnant women, yet they recommended it.
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:36.480]  And we're looking at a minimum of 30% miscarriage rate, probably higher.
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:41.840]  That's what's being reported, and this is self-reported, so we know the impacts are much higher.
[1:19:41.840 --> 1:19:45.920]  I mean, this is reprehensible medical male practice.
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:51.640]  Well, since you raised that Ben Shapiro's sister was a big pusher over to whole sex,
[1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:53.280]  she said she was going to take it.
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:55.280]  And then recently she said she just had a miscarriage.
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:59.080]  I know a lot of folks are on record saying they had miscarriages, but then after they
[1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:03.440]  took the vaccine or the so-called vaccine, what would you call these gene therapies or
[1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:05.760]  what would you call these franken shots?
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:08.840]  I mean, because they're not plastic vaccines, are they, doctor?
[1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:10.240]  No, no, no, no.
[1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:11.320]  They are not vaccines.
[1:20:11.320 --> 1:20:16.440]  Even though I forget whichever dictionary, they change the definition to include this,
[1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:23.320]  but they clearly do not meet the criteria previously used for all traditional vaccines.
[1:20:23.320 --> 1:20:29.400]  These are engineered with genetic technology that has not been proven, never been proven.
[1:20:29.400 --> 1:20:32.160]  There's no safety trials to confirm it.
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:37.440]  Essentially they put in messenger RNA, which is a bit of a genetic material in your body
[1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:44.640]  that allows your body to produce antibodies, and they perceive it as a safe way, but these
[1:20:44.640 --> 1:20:48.360]  messenger RNA molecules are very fragile, very perishable, and they have to encapsulate
[1:20:48.360 --> 1:20:53.760]  them, at least the Moderna and the, not the Johnson and Johnson, the Pfizer vaccine.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:58.520]  So those vaccines have it, and they encase it in a nanolipid zone that's composed of
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:03.560]  polyethylene glycol, which itself can cause an autoimmune reaction, but these nanolipid
[1:21:03.560 --> 1:21:10.600]  zones, oh my gosh, this gets this, instructions to create the spike protein to have most tissues
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:14.760]  of your body, and if it gets into the liver or the bone marrow it can produce, it can
[1:21:14.760 --> 1:21:18.200]  actually cause this severe clotting disorder, which has killed many people.
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:19.200]  It's well documented.
[1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:20.200]  No question.
[1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:21.200]  It has killed people.
[1:21:21.200 --> 1:21:24.360]  And I think the reports, the last time I looked it was over 3,000 to the VAERS database
[1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:28.560]  who are dying from this, and we know, there's lots of science to show, there's only one
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:32.120]  to 10% of the actual number of cases are reported.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:36.040]  So 3,000 have died, that means it's at least 30,000 to 300,000 who have died from the vaccine
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:38.600]  already, totally being suppressed.
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:41.880]  That is just so bombshell, and I know people who've gotten really sick from it, and I'm
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:43.680]  people that have died.
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:44.680]  They will die.
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:47.440]  There's no question they'll die.
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:50.600]  What is the time, Frank, because we know with mRNA vaccines, in one study all the
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:55.520]  ferrets died, in other studies a lot of the animals got sick, internal died later.
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:56.960]  That wasn't an MRI vaccine.
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:22:00.440]  That was a conventional coronavirus vaccine, and you're right, that was about eight or
[1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:03.680]  10 years ago, they gave them this coronavirus vaccine.
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:08.080]  All the ferrets got immunized, and in other words, they had sufficient antibodies to defeat
[1:22:08.080 --> 1:22:09.080]  the illness.
[1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:15.960]  The problem is, when they challenged them with the actual infection, they all died from
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:23.680]  a process called ADE, which is Antibody Dependent Enhancement, or I like better, PI, Paradoxical
[1:22:23.680 --> 1:22:24.680]  Immune Enhancement.
[1:22:24.680 --> 1:22:30.040]  In other words, their body was primed, and it became overactive to the infection, and
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:35.640]  when they got exposed to it, they had an overactive response, so is that a form of allergy?
[1:22:35.640 --> 1:22:40.560]  It's a type of allergy of sorts, but it's more specifically targeted towards the immune
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:41.560]  response.
[1:22:41.560 --> 1:22:42.560]  So is that what happened with the Spanish flu?
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.760]  A lot of experts, I'm not a doctor like you, I've read, think that they've already been
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:46.760]  it.
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:47.760]  No, no, no, no.
[1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:48.760]  They've been hit with one flu.
[1:22:48.760 --> 1:22:51.760]  They were already primed, so when a similar flu came along, that an autoimmune response,
[1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:52.760]  is that wrong?
[1:22:52.760 --> 1:22:53.760]  No, it's different.
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:54.760]  No.
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:58.760]  I mean, could have played a role, but more than what, because they didn't have vaccines
[1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.480]  back then, they were smallpox, as far as I know.
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:03.640]  Sure, tell us more about ADE, because I keep hearing about this.
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:08.960]  Yeah, ADE is an acronym for Antibody Dependent Enhancement.
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:13.280]  So essentially, when you're exposed to this, this is a conventional vaccine.
[1:23:13.280 --> 1:23:17.120]  I don't know that, we will probably have some element with mRNA vaccines, but, because
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  we don't know.
[1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:20.200]  I mean, this is all new.
[1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:24.280]  They've only been given the vaccines for a few months, and the next wave of coronavirus
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:28.120]  infections is going to be till fall or the winter, so we don't know.
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:32.840]  People might be dropping, those who are vaccinated might be dropping like flies, because of this
[1:23:32.840 --> 1:23:33.840]  ADE process.
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:35.680]  It's never been tested.
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:37.680]  There is no data on it.
[1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:39.960]  This was rushed through with Operation War of Speed.
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:41.280]  No one has been tested for this.
[1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:42.280]  No one.
[1:23:42.280 --> 1:23:46.840]  So we got, this is the most massive experiment in human history.
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:51.280]  They've got well over 100 million people in the United States, and probably a lot more
[1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:52.280]  than that worldwide.
[1:23:52.280 --> 1:23:54.960]  I don't know what the current stats are for those who are already immunized as of the
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:55.960]  States.
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:59.320]  So you're a smart medical doctor, you've got all these other prestigious medical doctors
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:04.040]  and scientists, Wolfgang Wudarg, Dr. Yidon, former chief scientist Pfizer, saying what
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:05.040]  you're saying.
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:06.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:10.760]  We're going to go to break, but just for 30 seconds, what is the establishment thinking?
[1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:13.680]  It sounds like they've created a disaster for themselves.
[1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:15.240]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:16.240]  It's going to cave in.
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:19.880]  It's going to crumble all around them, and it's just that we just have to be patient.
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.800]  We have to know that we have the truth that they're not going to win.
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:26.840]  All right, we got to go to break again, longer segment coming up, Dr. Joseph Mercola is
[1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:29.000]  blowing me away because he's a medical doctor.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:33.920]  He's an author, researcher, best-selling author, and his new book, Amazon Knows It's
[1:24:33.920 --> 1:24:34.920]  Gonna Be a Best Seller.
[1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.160]  He told me they bought a record number of them.
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:41.360]  I'm going to order a bunch of them because I need a book to give friends and families
[1:24:41.360 --> 1:24:45.120]  and neighbors from a respected doctor that will give them the facts they need.
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:46.120]  It's a life-saving book.
[1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:47.120]  Get it today.
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:53.920]  We'll be right back with Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.320]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:01.520]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:04.720]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:07.800]  The big, globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:09.120]  can to shut us down.
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.440]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air, and please support the local station you're
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:14.440]  listening to as well.
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:19.640]  At the same time, go to infowarsstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get
[1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:24.720]  a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:26.920]  on air in the face of this thing.
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:29.040]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:33.360]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:38.760]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:44.040]  products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarsstore.com, whether
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:48.600]  it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.520]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:54.840]  Thank you so much.
[1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:59.160]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:03.880]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including
[1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:08.960]  weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:09.960]  system.
[1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:15.960]  By producing RocketRest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarsstore.com,
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:20.160]  the new RocketRest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only

[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.480]  Many competitors sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but RocketRest was
[1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:34.600]  specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:39.920]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep supporting
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:42.640]  ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.160]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wake up feeling rested.
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:55.000]  So get the new RocketRest formula from Dr. Jones Naturals right now at infowarsstore.com.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:00.240]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are
[1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:03.400]  most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[1:27:03.400 --> 1:27:06.120]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:09.920]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:12.360]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:15.920]  That's why infowars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:17.720]  be buying it, we'd have the money.
[1:27:17.720 --> 1:27:21.160]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you notice a lot of other items at the
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:25.240]  store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:31.600]  But finally, X2 is back in stock, the good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide, so essential
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:32.600]  in your body.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:33.600]  It's really the missing link.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:36.920]  It's 50% off, we've got a big shipment of it at infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:41.360]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:45.920]  of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:50.560]  how great it is and not take it myself, but when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:51.560]  loss, it's incredible.
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:52.560]  It's essential.
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:53.560]  It's X2 at infowarsstore.com.
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:28:09.720]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:20.960]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:29.400]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here, go to banned.video, download the videos
[1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:32.440]  and share.
[1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:50.800]  Support the information war at infowarsstore.com and never give up the fight.
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:29:20.720]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report.
[1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:46.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:29:46.520 --> 1:30:12.660]  Yes, thank you.
[1:30:16.520 --> 1:30:22.520]  but somehow peacefully trying to stop them because this is really a genetic raping. This is a
[1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:28.600]  will to power. This is a vaccine big pharma industry in trouble buying up the UN, buying up
[1:30:28.600 --> 1:30:35.000]  health departments around the world, and really forcing a total takeover of surveillance and
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:40.200]  vaccine passports and all of it. But I think it's going to force innovation that's going to
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:44.040]  transcend them. You were talking some about that during the break, so you've got the floor. Please
[1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:51.800]  continue. Okay, so what can we do to address this? Let's turn on the positive. And first of all,
[1:30:51.800 --> 1:30:56.360]  don't get the vaccine. And I think a comment I made in one of the last segments was that I think
[1:30:56.360 --> 1:31:00.920]  the vaccines will kill all people. No, I don't. Most people will survive. But I think ultimately
[1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:05.320]  more people will die from the vaccine than do from COVID. I'm pretty confident of those numbers.
[1:31:05.320 --> 1:31:11.400]  But once you get the vaccine, you have no idea because we have no idea that we just don't know.
[1:31:11.400 --> 1:31:15.960]  No one has ever, ever done the studies. It's never been done. Those low long term, normally
[1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:21.320]  takes nine or 10 years. So don't get the vaccine. What can you do? You can improve your immune
[1:31:21.320 --> 1:31:25.480]  system. And I've written about those things before. They're like things like vitamin D and zinc.
[1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:31.240]  And it's almost summer. It is where I live in Florida. And you don't have to take a supplement.
[1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:35.480]  You just take your, just go into your swimsuit and go outside in the sunshine. It has to be
[1:31:35.480 --> 1:31:38.840]  on your skin. You just can't be outside in the sun. It has to be on your bare skin. It
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:43.240]  tries a lot of other benefits. And then time restricted eating, where you compress your
[1:31:43.240 --> 1:31:46.840]  eating windows. It's like six or eight hours. You don't do it all at once because most of us eat
[1:31:46.840 --> 1:31:52.040]  more than 12 hours a day. And when you compress your eating window, you develop metabolic
[1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:58.440]  flexibility or also otherwise known as insulin sensitivity so that your body is far more resistant.
[1:31:58.440 --> 1:32:03.560]  Because we know that obesity is affected, impacted by the COVID-19. And what is the
[1:32:03.560 --> 1:32:07.880]  driver of obesity? Metabolic flexibility or insulin resistance. So that's a simple,
[1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:12.600]  easy thing that you can do. And also avoid vegetable oil. Vegetable oil, Alex, is the
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:18.120]  single most dangerous food you could possibly eat. And okay, yeah. So we don't buy the bottle of
[1:32:18.120 --> 1:32:24.120]  corn oil or safflower oil on the shelf. But it's hidden in almost every single processed food.
[1:32:24.120 --> 1:32:30.200]  It is clearly a big strategy that you really need to get into. And so if you do time restricted
[1:32:30.200 --> 1:32:35.320]  eating, eliminate vegetable oil, you're going to radically improve your health and the need for
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:40.040]  any intervention. So those are the simple things you can do. And of course, the left always push
[1:32:40.040 --> 1:32:45.720]  vegetable oil is great. Why is it so bad? Oh my gosh. It is the most pernicious metabolic toxin
[1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:52.120]  ever invented by man. It is killing. It's responsible for killing most of the two most
[1:32:52.120 --> 1:32:57.000]  common causes of heart disease and cancer. The primary culprit is vegetable oils. It is not
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:01.400]  sugar. It is not sugar. It is not sugar. It is vegetable oils. I am confident of that.
[1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:07.480]  Sugar is a factor. So if it is processed food, do you think it is sugar? But in processed foods,
[1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:10.760]  I have vegetable oils. So you have got to get that out. And foods that we think might be
[1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:14.360]  healthy like even olive oil. And explain what vegetable oil does. I guess it just
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:18.680]  gums up your arteries or what happens? No, no, no. It is a good question. We have limited time.
[1:33:18.680 --> 1:33:22.600]  But I am ready. That is one of my next books, Alex, because it is such an important topic.
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:28.280]  But essentially, it disrupts mitochondria. So those are the energy producing
[1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:33.480]  organelles in your cells that produce the ATP. And it just disrupts this electron
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:38.600]  transport chain and causes increases oxidative stress and inflammation. It is the most damaging.
[1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:42.520]  Here is the thing, Alex. Sugar is in and out within minutes, right?
[1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:46.600]  Vegetable oil lasts for seven years in your cells because it is embedded in cell membranes.
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:50.840]  And you have got a big problem if you are eating it. Wow. So it is literally like a
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:57.400]  tire baby. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yeah. So that is why you want to get it out.
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:02.120]  And you have to be really assiduous and diligent, almost obsessive compulsive and read the labels.
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:05.480]  But essentially, almost all process foods have them. There are some that don't, but most do.
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:09.800]  So that is why the New York Times says you need vegetable oil. You don't need animal fat.
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:15.320]  Are they literally trying to kill us? Well, yeah, they are aligned with the
[1:34:16.200 --> 1:34:19.560]  propaganda to destroy us. There is no question. I don't know if they are doing it consciously,
[1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:25.240]  but it is a whole other story. We could go on for hours on that. But just know that that is the
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:29.560]  truth. And you can look on my site for this information and it will give you details. Now,
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:33.400]  the other things you can do is part of this. Why do we do in the global recent times? You
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:38.040]  talked about this enormously with other guests, I am sure. And it is a transfer of wealth.
[1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:42.440]  And they are going to have the CBDC, the Central Bank Digital Currencies, there is a way to
[1:34:42.440 --> 1:34:47.320]  control this. Essentially, that is the social credit system that is coming up with the vaccine
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:53.000]  passports. Because they can wipe out everything you own in the CBDCs. If they don't like you,
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.600]  did something wrong, they don't like, boom, gone, you don't have anything. They have been doing
[1:34:56.600 --> 1:35:01.080]  it already. The guys in their own gyms that were resisting the tyrannical orders of Cuomo,
[1:35:01.080 --> 1:35:06.440]  they liquidated their bank accounts because they gave them these $15,000 a day penalty for
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:12.840]  fantasy and they destroyed them. So, one of the things you can do to protect yourself is to go.
[1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:17.960]  The answer to this, I believe, I could be wrong, but I believe, is based on the blockchain,
[1:35:17.960 --> 1:35:22.680]  but not just centralized blockchain, because the CBDCs, the Central Bank Digital Currencies, will be
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:27.320]  centralized blockchains. But a decentralized blockchain, and the best example of that,
[1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:34.760]  is Bitcoin. And I believe so much in them, I think most people should get them as a protection for
[1:35:34.760 --> 1:35:39.480]  the future. And so, where do you get it? Well, there is a really good place called Swan Bitcoin,
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:46.200]  SwanBitcoinSWAandBitcoin.com. And if you put a backslash from Arcola, they will give you $10
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:50.040]  a free Bitcoin. And you could buy it there. Absolutely. That's the best place. I don't care
[1:35:50.040 --> 1:35:55.720]  where they do it. SwanBitcoin.com. We do it as well. That is a place where it's a real place
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:58.840]  and you're not going to have any weird stuff. And it's good that they stick your toe in it.
[1:36:00.440 --> 1:36:03.640]  Well, yeah. And the nice thing about them, because I'm a good friend with Corey,
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:10.680]  is the guy who started it, he can also set up regular deposits so that you could,
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:15.080]  every week or month, you can put in $100 and it will automatically buy whatever price. Because
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:19.080]  the key is what's something called dollar-cost-averagery, where you just buy whatever the price is.
[1:36:19.080 --> 1:36:22.120]  And you don't spend it, the last thing, if it goes up two times or three times,
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:25.000]  don't spend it. You keep it for five or 10 years, because eventually it's going to be
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.840]  worth a million dollars. And if they take it, I believe it will go back up. Max Kaiser told me
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:33.400]  that 10 years ago. He's always been right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I heard that story. Max gave you,
[1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:36.920]  supposedly, I don't know what the truth is. He tried to give me, Ed Bilderberg will
[1:36:36.920 --> 1:36:42.200]  cover it, $10,000. Do you know how much that's worth today, Alex? $500 million.
[1:36:42.200 --> 1:36:46.280]  $550 million. $10,000 Bitcoin.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.040]  It's a true story. Lee Ann McAdoo saw it. Richard Reeve saw it. They all saw it. And we've dug
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:56.040]  through all the old laptops. We can't find it. We've got one more segment, but we've got some
[1:36:56.040 --> 1:37:00.760]  time left here. Just go back to Bill Gates, because you've done your research. He modeled
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:06.360]  what the Rockefellers did to hide his wealth. And the fact that they're trying to move the halo
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:09.240]  off of him, because he's tarnished onto her, I think is dead on.
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:13.000]  Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty convinced of that. And that was the strategy that
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:17.320]  Rockefellers successfully used, because he was equally vilified as Gates was a century ago.
[1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:21.720]  And that strategy worked for him. And we didn't have the technology and the resources to
[1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.000]  disseminate truth like we did back then. I mean, like we do now that we did.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:30.280]  So this means that their attempt to build him back up, the face lift has failed,
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:34.680]  and now they're going to try to move what she said. She'll still run the foundation. So this is a
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:40.520]  very critical operation. Bill Gates will be controlling it for sure. But he's not going to
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:46.600]  be the front person, the spokesperson. It'll be Melinda. Because he's so tarnished at this.
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:49.880]  And then now if you attack his population, oh, you're attacking a woman.
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:53.720]  Yeah, but if you want more details with Gates, because you can go on for hours.
[1:37:54.440 --> 1:37:58.760]  James Corbett has the most amazing, I think it was a two-hour series he put together,
[1:37:58.760 --> 1:38:04.840]  James Corbett. Corbettreport.com. He's been heavily censored too, but he's done a magnificent
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:07.800]  we've got to be stopped. They just pulled his very scholarly videos off YouTube.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:13.880]  Yeah. And I did it about two weeks ago, maybe three. I did a really great video with an interview
[1:38:13.880 --> 1:38:18.840]  with Vandana Shiva. When we talk about Gates extensively, so that's another resource that
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:22.760]  I think you would love. It's got, oh man, it's got. Final segment. Tell us what you want to
[1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:27.720]  cover when we come back, Dr. McCullough. I think we can go over some of the strategies,
[1:38:27.720 --> 1:38:34.840]  the reasons why we're doing this in my interview with Naomi Wolf. Oh, yeah. She's been doing
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:39.560]  a great job exposing things, getting demonized. She's a progressive. She's the opposite of you,
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:43.560]  but you're aligned at the same mission. Well, she's against the police state. She's against
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.280]  torture. She's not having medical freedom. I think she's a real liberal. I think she's a
[1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:50.680]  good person. I think she has a heart. We'll be right back with Dr. McCullough.
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:56.840]  Absolutely. Serving with info wars is a great honor,
[1:38:57.480 --> 1:39:04.200]  but I still need my morning coffee. And luckily our break room at the info wars headquarters
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:11.080]  is stock full of high quality info war store, Patriot blend coffee grown in the high mountains
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:19.720]  of southern Mexico. The Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:27.720]  the perfect cup. A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity. There has never been a more
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:34.200]  important time to support info wars. So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom,
[1:39:34.920 --> 1:39:42.840]  then you can help order now at the info war store, sign up for auto ship and get your own

[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:25.080]  where you go and what you do. Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms,
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:29.640]  big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil. And in the surveillance state, we need to
[1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:34.360]  more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:39.160]  in. These are the highest quality, highest ratings. They're available at infowarstore.com in four
[1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:45.480]  different colors and they are only $19.95. The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:50.120]  everywhere. They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war. Please take action
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:56.760]  today, protect your privacy and fund the info war. The scientific dictatorship that I've been
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:03.000]  warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational. The globalists are
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.520]  out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:12.440]  is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:18.120]  decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it on. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:22.120]  if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:27.480]  God for guidance, we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:32.680]  is essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting info
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:37.080]  wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products
[1:41:37.080 --> 1:41:44.520]  for you and your family. And they're also funding our operation infowarstore.com infowarstore.com is
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:48.200]  incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:53.080]  back in like bodies, vaso beats and others. So get them today at infowarstore.com. And I thank you
[1:41:53.080 --> 1:41:59.800]  for being part of the resistance. 170 years ago, the British royal family financed scientists
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:05.640]  to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That grew into the robber barons and
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:09.960]  then into the eugenics movement, Kettler and of course the rest is history. Our film in game,

[1:42:52.920 --> 1:43:18.920]  infowarstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:30.040]  All right. I don't usually get involved in the purchase of the books we sell at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:33.480]  Got a great crew that are patriots and whenever they think it's the most important, they carry.
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:39.320]  We probably only carry 15, 20 books a year. So I was so excited about his book, The Truth About
[1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:44.280]  COVID-19 Exposing the Great Reset, Lockdowns, Vaccine Passports and the New Normal, Joseph
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:49.480]  Mercola and Ronnie Cummins, forwarded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which I've read before. It's incredible.
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:55.480]  And I called our purchase guy over, Blake, and I said, I want you to order a bunch of these.
[1:43:55.480 --> 1:44:01.080]  He goes, we already are selling it. We're already sold out of the 500 we bought. So we've got it
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:10.600]  infowarstore.com. And because you need a big nice book, well documented with all the stuff sourced,
[1:44:10.600 --> 1:44:16.280]  to give to friends, family, neighbors, lawyers, to put at the library, to give to your local
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:23.720]  doctor, we need to fight an information war. This is the globalist system depends on ignorance.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:31.160]  So get the book, The Truth About COVID-19 by Dr. Joseph Mercola at infowarstore.com. I don't
[1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:36.040]  care where you get it. Just get it. Exposing the Great Reset. What an important book. And I've got
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:38.840]  a good, it doesn't have any reviews yet. We just started selling a couple of days ago.
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:45.320]  But we're ordering 10,000 of these because everybody's got to get it. Yeah, you know all
[1:44:45.320 --> 1:44:49.000]  about this stuff. We have all these guests on. You're informed listeners. Your friends, your
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:54.680]  neighbors, your family aren't. This is life and death. I personally am going to get 50 of these
[1:44:54.680 --> 1:44:59.560]  if I can buy them at cost before he sells them to us for. Great deal. And I'm going to get these
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:03.720]  out to everybody I know. This is what needs to happen. This is an information war. Get my film
[1:45:03.720 --> 1:45:07.880]  in game as well. Blueprint for global enslavement that predicted the Great Reset 14 years ago.
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:12.600]  Back in print again. We just sold 20,000 copies of those the last three weeks. But we're selling
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.280]  them for 3.95 a piece. So it's great. We're selling a lot because it takes a lot of money to
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:19.800]  fund this place. And I appreciate you all and your support. But knowledge is power.
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:23.720]  Dr. McCauley, you want to talk about Naomi Wolfe. Anti-war, anti-torture.
[1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:28.520]  She had to admit that Trump was even better than all the Democrats. A real liberal who has a
[1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:32.760]  conscience. She's been shunned. She's been attacked. Saying this is medical tyranny.
[1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:37.080]  And of course, you just interviewed her. Tell us about her views on this whole power grab.
[1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:43.000]  Well, it's interesting because she's a traditional progressive and you're a conservative. But you're
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:47.720]  both oriented on the same purpose, which is freedom, personal freedom and liberty. And
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:54.200]  she actually voted for Biden in the last election and was opposed to the Second Amendment. But she's
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:46:01.000]  changed those positions. So she wrote a book in 2007 called The End of America. And it's
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:06.040]  re-released by Chelsea, who has actually the publisher of The Truth About COVID. And they're
[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:10.200]  releasing the first and last chapter and the forward for free. So you can download it for free.
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:13.880]  You want to get the whole book? Or just watch my interview with her. And it's very fascinating
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:18.920]  because it's sort of an update to it. But the crux of it is that most people don't understand
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:22.360]  this. I mean, maybe most of your viewers do, but certainly the average American doesn't,
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:29.080]  is that there are founding fathers. They either themselves or their parents or their grandparents
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:35.400]  escaped tyranny. They escaped tyranny. And they knew what tyranny was. Read the Declaration of
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:40.280]  Independence. And you'll see what it is. And they escaped that. And those people who signed
[1:46:40.280 --> 1:46:45.800]  the Declaration of Independence, every one of them knew that they would be executed for treason.
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:52.520]  Executed for treason if they failed. That's the commitment that we don't... The average person
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:46:57.560]  has no concept of what the personal risk is, what they sacrificed to get the personal freedom
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:02.360]  that each and every one of us enjoy today that is rapidly appearing, disappearing, sorry. So
[1:47:02.360 --> 1:47:07.160]  her book, The End of America outlines 10 steps. And she says we're in step 10 now. And that's her
[1:47:07.160 --> 1:47:12.920]  next book, step 10. So this is the call to action. I mean, we don't... We have a limited time.
[1:47:12.920 --> 1:47:18.840]  This is the window is closing. I look at, you know, pre-World War II in Germany, you know,
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:23.240]  the window was closing. So you've got to be prepared because otherwise it will collapse. It
[1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:28.040]  will collapse. And we need to take... We need a resistance. We need people to understand that they
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:32.600]  need to take action because this is the most serious threat. Yeah, am I interested in health?
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:36.680]  Yes, I'm interested in health on steroids. I want people to be healthy, but it's impossibly healthy
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:41.320]  when every bit of information about how to achieve that is suppressed and banned.
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:45.640]  And I agree. I haven't read your book yet. I've read the forward, but I'm going to flog it because
[1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:50.600]  people still read some, especially professionals, but they don't read as much as they used to.
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.120]  And they respect a big, thick, nice book, well done with all the facts. And so that will just
[1:47:56.120 --> 1:48:01.480]  cut through all the disinfo because when you actually look at Fauci, and if you look at Bill
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:07.000]  Gates and you look at the Wuhan lab, they lied every step of the way. And you've got
[1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:11.800]  Gates-funded groups calling for you to have the Pentagon shut you down and shut down
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:16.520]  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. When you're saying things that are on the NIH website that if you don't
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:21.480]  have vitamin D3, you die. That, you know, hey, it looks like it came out of the Wuhan lab.
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:26.600]  That's now Redfield, the former head of the CDC says that. I mean, this bullying is insane
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:30.280]  because even if you were wrong, you have a right to say what you want, but you're not wrong. You're
[1:48:30.280 --> 1:48:35.000]  right. Yeah, even if you believe them, the people who developed this vaccine sincerely
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  believe that this would be the best thing they could do to help the epidemic. Well, then why
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:45.480]  suppress, censor, and squash every opposing view if you believe it's that true? Why don't you allow
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:50.680]  a dialogue? And they always say science, science, science, science. Science is about challenging,
[1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:55.240]  is about being challenged. It's impossible. Absolutely impossible. If you have informed
[1:48:55.240 --> 1:49:02.680]  consent, if you only get one side, it's impossible. Wow, we've got four minutes left. You're on fire,
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:06.680]  as usual, Dr. Mercola, but I've been interviewing you for a long time. You seem really fired up
[1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:11.320]  and positive. I mean, you opened up with saying, look, this is the fall of Bill Gates and having
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:18.280]  to move the halo from him to his, yeah. Now, I wasn't completely responsible. I contributed to it.
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:22.920]  There's others. Many others are exposing his fraud and that people are, you should go to YouTube,
[1:49:22.920 --> 1:49:27.880]  which still hasn't my interview with Vanda Nashiva. It was only two weeks ago. I mean,
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:35.640]  there's still, we have over 1300 comments. 98% of my reader, my moderators, myself personally,
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:41.080]  are positive. They all are saying what a creep, what an evil creature this guy is. We got literally
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:45.560]  one or two out of a hundred that are opposing that. He is being exposed and that's why he got
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:49.720]  divorced. Well, that's right. He came out and admitted that 80% of those that took the mRNA
[1:49:49.720 --> 1:49:55.000]  Pfizer vaccine were getting bad side effects. And I, and then he said, Joe Rogan, he had his
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:00.360]  newsguard group say, I and Joe Rogan lied when we said 80%. So we just showed the clip. Joe Rogan
[1:50:00.360 --> 1:50:05.240]  put it out. It got about 10 million views total on YouTube and Instagram. And he didn't know what to
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:10.360]  do. It just devastated him that here he is saying, admitting 80% gets sick. And then a two weeks later,
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:15.720]  he says we're liars when we have the quote by him. It's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, if
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:19.720]  you're, you know, the best strategy in life is to always tell the truth because when you lie,
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:23.960]  you always remember what your last, what your lie was. And then you get so easy to get tripped up.
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:27.000]  But if you're always telling the truth, it doesn't matter because you can come over to everyone's
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  ways. Always the truth. Well, I'm going to put a prayer out to God and just to the ether and
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:36.280]  to the listeners that, you know, we need to get you on the Joe Rogan podcast because that would
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:41.160]  well, I know you're a friend. He's got, he is, I think he's some pro vaccine, but that I'm telling
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:46.760]  you that I would be so deeply appreciative because I, you know, I, I have a lot of people I know
[1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:51.080]  and I would love to go and visit with them. I mean, I, and he, I have enormous respect for him.
[1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:55.640]  And I know where Joe is. He knows the vaccine science. He can be tainted. He had problems. He
[1:50:55.640 --> 1:50:59.960]  knows attenuated viruses. That's a real science. And, and, you know, he, he then tries to defer
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:03.800]  to the experts and have a foot in both fields because he's really not sure. But I know he's
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:08.520]  freaked out by them trying to inject babies and children. I know he's, he's also on Spotify
[1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:13.640]  and Spotify banned me last week. No, with no reason, no justification. We didn't have any,
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:18.040]  any things that they said not to, and you couldn't, we actually objected to it and went through the
[1:51:18.040 --> 1:51:22.600]  resolution process and they changed their terms of service after our objection. So they banned.
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:25.480]  So that may be a reason why it doesn't want me on because I'm banned from Spotify.
[1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:29.480]  Well, absolutely. Well, there, there is a reign of terror going on.
[1:51:29.480 --> 1:51:34.920]  And it's very frightening. And that's great to see Naomi Wolf is pro second amendment now. I
[1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:39.960]  didn't know that. Oh, she has, she changed her position. Totally changed. This is all reason
[1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:43.720]  because she's committed to the truth. She understands it at a foundational level. If you,
[1:51:43.720 --> 1:51:48.920]  if you have integrity, as you can have beliefs, but you, you change as you evolve, you grow into
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:52.520]  it. I mean, sure. Guns cause a lot. People cause problems with guns. They're bad people. Just like
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:56.920]  people with cars do bad things. But, but now she's getting things are so tyrannical. We've
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:00.040]  got to have a balance of power. We, the people got to be able to have guns.
[1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:07.000]  Absolutely. There's no question. It's an essential element of preserving our hard
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:10.840]  earned freedoms that our forefathers sacrificed their very lives for.
[1:52:11.480 --> 1:52:15.240]  And we may have to be called to do that too. We don't know. I hope it doesn't come to that,
[1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:22.680]  but it's a really good possibility unless we act and act succinctly, succinctly,
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:27.960]  strongly. Absolutely. You're absolutely doc. And that's it. None of us want violence, but
[1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:32.440]  offensively they're coming at us with Franken shots. And if they really send out COVID tracers,
[1:52:32.440 --> 1:52:35.320]  like they said, they're going to do in Europe and start dragging people away. They won't take
[1:52:35.320 --> 1:52:39.560]  the shots in the future. They admit that's their plan. That is a, that is a violation
[1:52:39.560 --> 1:52:44.680]  of the Nuremberg code. Isn't it, doctor? Yeah, absolutely. I'm not calling for armed revolution.
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:49.320]  I'm just saying you, we should honor the second amendment. Our forefathers were smart enough to
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:53.480]  figure out that that was an essential element of preserving your freedom. It's an insurance policy,
[1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:58.840]  so tyrants know it's always there. Right. Yeah. And it protects you and your family. Just, you
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:02.120]  know, you have to have proper training. All right. The book is available at Merkola.com,
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:07.960]  Amazon.com. It is available right now at info or store.com. Go to, go to our news,

[1:53:12.440 --> 1:53:16.840]  the information we had to take down. All right. I'd come back as soon as that comes back out,
[1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:21.400]  doctor. Yeah, I will. I'll know. I know you have him out. Alex, I love you. I'm so glad that
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:25.880]  we're aligned on this, this mission because we're going to win. We are going to win.
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:30.680]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. General Merkola. He's awesome. We love him too. Thank you, sir.
[1:53:30.680 --> 1:53:36.280]  All right. There he goes. We have another thought criminal coming on. Nick Pointes is taking action.
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:40.440]  He's gonna file suit. You heard it here first. I guess the TSA for putting on the no file list.
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:45.640]  Hour number three. Straight ahead. Tell her the best product. I'm not, I'm not supposed to
[1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:49.320]  be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried turbo force, you need to try it.
[1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:54.440]  I've tried turbo force with everything. Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:53:58.520]  force in my coffee. That was a crazy week. I don't, I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:02.760]  products go, turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to taking control
[1:54:02.760 --> 1:54:06.840]  of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:12.920]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks I'm going to give that person over there a better
[1:54:12.920 --> 1:54:16.760]  life. I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:20.680]  that guy over there healthier, happier and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:24.120]  girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:27.720]  knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:31.640]  single way? There's only one person who woke up and fought that and that was me. I woke up and
[1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:35.080]  thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[1:54:35.080 --> 1:54:38.120]  And that's why you need to go to info wars.com. Take control of your health right now and support
[1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:42.280]  the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the turbo force.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:50.840]  Kool-Aid bad. The turbo force is good. Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes,
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:56.520]  everything has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality

[1:55:44.600 --> 1:56:14.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:56:14.920 --> 1:56:20.360]  Walt Disney not only saturated his films with masonic hand gestures and 666
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:25.000]  but also added subliminal images with hidden sexuality.
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:32.360]  Altjian claims that the square and compass are actually symbolizing the sex act. The woman's
[1:56:32.360 --> 1:56:39.320]  leg spread open and a man mounting her. The G symbolizes the generative principle of creation.
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:46.680]  The all seeing eye symbolizes the head of the penis and the ray shooting forth the orgasm.
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:53.400]  Each year, 13 high level masons may be invited to join the top of this monstrous pyramid,
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:57:00.600]  the royal order of gestures dedicated to nothing but sexual depravity. There is no sin.
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:10.280]  There is only nature. Why do you think that witchcraft has disappeared? It never disappeared.
[1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:17.240]  It was hidden, forced to go into hiding by the appearance of Jesus on the human scene.
[1:57:18.280 --> 1:57:23.640]  Another reason why he's passionately hated. 33rd degree Mason Alastair Crowley wrote
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:28.280]  how he pecked at the eyes of Jesus on the cross, how the new age will arise from the
[1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:33.400]  destruction of Christianity, and how all children shall be accustomed from infancy
[1:57:33.400 --> 1:57:39.800]  to witness every type of sexual act. According to the royal art of Freemasonry,
[1:57:39.800 --> 1:57:45.880]  magic is the highest and most divine. And what is this magic? Any living being is a storehouse
[1:57:45.880 --> 1:57:51.400]  of energy, varying in quantity according to the size and health of the animal. At the depth of
[1:57:51.400 --> 1:57:56.520]  the animal, this energy is liberated suddenly. The animal therefore should be killed within the
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.520]  circle. For the highest spiritual working, one must accordingly choose that victim which contains
[1:58:02.520 --> 1:58:09.640]  the greatest and purest force, a male child. We are witnessing the culmination of their mysterious
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:14.520]  arcanum, the destruction of Christianity and the mass sacrifice of humanity.
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:21.400]  Created in 1979 by the Masonic order of the Rose Cross, the first Luciferian commandant
[1:58:21.400 --> 1:58:27.160]  carved into the Georgia guide stones is to maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual
[1:58:27.160 --> 1:58:33.960]  balance with nature. High-level Mason Friedrich Nietzsche wrote how Christianity is more harmful
[1:58:33.960 --> 1:58:42.200]  than any vice and considered Christians sick animals. Their utopian new age, as written about
[1:58:42.200 --> 1:58:48.520]  in the Satanic Bible and in the Lucius Trust, consultants to the European Union, is nothing
[1:58:48.520 --> 1:58:54.520]  more than the absolute destruction of Christianity. Aleister Crowley wrote how the people need to
[1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:59.000]  be ruled by the state and the world must be bathed in blood to usher in the new age.
[1:59:00.520 --> 1:59:06.520]  Subversion of all governments and world religions has been going on in secrecy for centuries.
[1:59:07.640 --> 1:59:13.560]  Religious leaders, heads of state, and your favorite pop stars have practically all been
[1:59:13.560 --> 1:59:21.560]  absorbed into this hidden hand of Satanism. In 1991, the Nohide Laws were signed into U.S. Law
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:29.960]  by Skolin Bones member George Bush. Once these laws are practiced openly, it will be blasphemy
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:36.200]  to call Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior, punishable by death. They want to bring us
[1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:43.000]  back to the days of blood sacrifice. Whether you believe or not, the culture of compassion,
[1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:52.120]  mercy, and love is Christian. Christ ended the days of blood sacrifice. Christ forgave us of our
[1:59:52.120 --> 2:00:00.920]  sins. All of us liberated us so that no man could stand between the individual and God.
[2:00:01.480 --> 2:00:06.920]  It's no wonder why they hide in the shadows. With a religion based on their own weakness,
[2:00:06.920 --> 2:00:14.440]  their so-called magic is nothing other than ruthless thuggery and deceit. Like broken animals,
[2:00:14.440 --> 2:00:18.120]  they fear the true light and want to drag you into the darkness with them.
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:35.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is Illuminati Unveiled. It just went live about an hour ago at band.video.
[2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:42.040]  Go click on the left-hand corner, find the Gregory section, and share it. It's a very,
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:47.160]  very important piece. I'm going to do a part two and go back to the origins of Freemasonry,
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:51.320]  which predates Christianity, because the whole satanic arm of it is just one vein of it, but
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:58.120]  it's an accurate report. Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so, saying
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:03.560]  where are most of the best-selling products you have that we love? And my answer is the supply
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:08.440]  chain has broken down. I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:13.000]  these. And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in. That's why Info Wars is in financial
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:17.320]  trouble is because if we had the products, you would be buying it. We have the money, but so many
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:21.640]  of them have been sold out, just like you noticed a lot of other items at the store aren't available
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:27.400]  because civilization is being artificially imploded. But finally, X2 is back in stock,
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:31.960]  the good halogen, Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential in your body. It's really the missing
[2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:37.320]  link. It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com. Now when it gets ready to
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:41.720]  sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up,
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:45.960]  and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:50.520]  and not take it myself. But when I do, stamina, levido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:01:50.520 --> 2:02:20.360]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com. Well, CNN is extremely pleased
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:24.840]  because all these different groups and organizations are announcing that
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:32.280]  for the children, they're going to wear masks forever. But children don't even get sick from COVID-19.
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:37.960]  And if you have your vitamins and minerals in sunlight and good water, you're invincible.
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:43.560]  But they don't want you knowing that. And they love the religion of being victims.
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:51.400]  And so even if they're vaccinated, well, they do nothing. I've got a bunch of reports here
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:58.520]  that make my head spin dealing with COVID-19 where they're now reporting that the most
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:07.000]  vaccinated countries in the world have the highest COVID-19 rates. Well, and they're confirming
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:12.360]  what that Yale medical doctor said last week on the war room. That's the other war room with
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:19.320]  Steve Bannon, that the majority of people going to the hospital that they say have COVID,
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:25.080]  it's from the vaccine. And that's in my stack. Now, Nick Fuentes called me yesterday and he said,
[2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:28.440]  hey, I want to thank you for getting me Norm Paddus. We're going to file a suit tomorrow
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:30.760]  and I'm ready to come on your show and break it. And he was supposed to be on right now.
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:35.800]  He's always a busy guy. So we'll see if he pops in later in the hour. But
[2:03:37.240 --> 2:03:40.360]  he talked about producer this morning, but it doesn't matter. The good news is they're fighting
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:46.440]  back against him being put on a no fly list. And so that news is breaking here right now.
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:49.640]  And so that's what's going on. If they can get away with doing this, Nick Fuentes,
[2:03:49.640 --> 2:03:52.920]  they can get away with doing it to anybody. He wasn't even in the Capitol. He was outside the
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:58.760]  Capitol. We can call for going into the Capitol. It's just crazy. And I watched the left all over
[2:03:58.760 --> 2:04:03.080]  Twitter every time I'm trending because I like to go search it and look at what's happening because
[2:04:03.080 --> 2:04:06.760]  there's so much cool stuff our listeners put on Twitter. I found a lot of stuff with the show on
[2:04:06.760 --> 2:04:12.520]  there, links and stuff I didn't know about. And as fast as the page loads, just more Alex Jones
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:17.000]  tweets load, especially when I'm like number one, totally makes the globalist pull their hair out.
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:24.440]  And I just saw a lot of crazy stuff. And I see the left
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:32.200]  on there constantly showing photos of me at Georgia with Ali Alexander and state rep now
[2:04:32.200 --> 2:04:37.720]  running, I guess, for what is it Senate or governor? I forget Vernon Jones. I guess it's
[2:04:37.720 --> 2:04:42.040]  governor isn't I forget the point. He's a great guy, big tall, handsome, smart, very well spoken,
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:46.600]  black guy, very, very presidential. I think he's been a Democrat, flipped over to Republicans.
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:52.360]  He said, why don't you guys come in the Capitol will be respectful. We won't be loud and we'll
[2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:58.120]  do a group photo. So about 500 of us went inside the other 500 or so stayed outside of that one
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:03.480]  demonstration. We all stood there and posed on the stairway to the second floor of the Capitol
[2:05:03.480 --> 2:05:08.040]  and took a photo. And they show that photo everywhere. I just thought of this the crew
[2:05:08.040 --> 2:05:12.280]  didn't even time to pull it up. I mean, they show it. It's been tweeted hundreds of thousands of
[2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:16.760]  times conservatively. I mean, I mean, there are tweets where one photo of it's been tweeted
[2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:22.280]  100,000 times. And that's what makes me trend on Twitter is they think it's hurting me to go,
[2:05:22.280 --> 2:05:29.480]  look, here he is with Ali Alexander and state rep. No, that's not the photo. It's another
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:34.440]  one when we're standing at the bottom, but that's the stairs. Yeah. And Vernon Jones is directing
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:39.240]  us on how to how to fill it up and how to take the group photo. But I'm pointing, he's pointing
[2:05:39.240 --> 2:05:46.360]  and Ali Alexander's pointing. And then they run it everywhere, including newspapers. Here is the
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:53.720]  proof of Alex Jones, the others video of it, and Ali Alexander in the Capitol that day commanding
[2:05:53.720 --> 2:06:01.000]  the attack. Yeah, then they show photos of Jones, the black Jones, telling people how to pose for
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:06.200]  the photo. And they say, and look, this unknown man, because they don't want to say to state rep,
[2:06:06.200 --> 2:06:10.520]  he was also needs to be arrested, whoever he is. And then people tell them in the comments,
[2:06:10.520 --> 2:06:17.240]  they go, hey, that's Georgia in November. They go, shut up, racist. So ladies and gentlemen,
[2:06:17.240 --> 2:06:25.400]  that is the level of disinformation. Yes, that's the photo. Here is Ali Alexander with Alex Jones,
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:33.400]  an unknown black man, and other people directing the crowd. That's one of my security guys, Tim,
[2:06:33.400 --> 2:06:37.720]  you know, they're again trying to get the group photo together. And they turn that into the
[2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:43.720]  devastating assault. There's Nick Fuentes right there. But don't worry, he's on a no fly list now,
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:51.480]  because he dared to go to the Georgia Capitol, and they showed the photo everywhere, and said it was
[2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:59.400]  the US Capitol. And I'm digressing here, but you have to understand, since January 7th, the day
[2:06:59.400 --> 2:07:07.080]  after, they tweak this every day. 2000 retweets, 5000 retweets, 10,000 retweets, 20,000 retweets.
[2:07:07.720 --> 2:07:14.840]  And they just show it and show it and go, why is he not arrested? Why is Jones not in jail?
[2:07:14.840 --> 2:07:21.080]  Here he is in the Capitol. And the FBI comes out and goes, we're investigating, we're investigating
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:28.920]  the photo. It's like, give us the head of Jones, give us the head of Fuentes. Just look at us in
[2:07:28.920 --> 2:07:34.600]  there attacking the Capitol. Yeah, there's one right there. Why is Alex Jones,
[2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:41.240]  when is Alex Jones getting arrested? Yeah, I see that Don Winslow guy all the time.
[2:07:41.240 --> 2:07:45.880]  He'll get thousands of retweets showing photos of you, like, my God, here he is in the Capitol,
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:55.880]  launching the attack. Why are these people not in jail now? And then commenters go, here's the video
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:08:03.400]  from November 18th. And no response. And then the left keeps reposting it. Because again,
[2:08:03.400 --> 2:08:08.920]  these are known liars. They love lying. They don't care if you find out they're lying, they like it.
[2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:15.160]  They cannot help it. Look, I've digressed. I got to settle down. I've had too much coffee.
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:20.840]  Our wake up America coffee is so good. Oh my gosh, it's so good. And I've been misbehaving myself.
[2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:25.640]  I people noticed the last few weeks I've had my energy of bouncing off the walls and I've been
[2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:31.000]  being a bad beaver. I've been having a couple cups of my wake up America coffee. And then I've been
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:36.760]  working late. Yesterday I had a quarter of a turbo force at four o'clock. And I was up here at eight
[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:40.760]  o'clock at night still working bouncing off the walls. And then I couldn't go to sleep last night
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:47.080]  till midnight. So yeah, two cups of coffee and a quarter turbo force. And I was bouncing off the
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:54.760]  walls by the way. But I have a turbo force because turbo force arrived yesterday in the 18 wheeler
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:09:01.560]  from the US plant. 10 hours of clean energy is what it really should be called. I originally
[2:09:01.560 --> 2:09:06.760]  named it turbo force. And it's 10 hours of clean good energy with everything. It's got t
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:13.160]  factors that the expert top developer we hired to develop it as in there to carry the
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:20.600]  five types of caffeine into the brain. And it's five types that are time released differently.
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:28.600]  And then to have you come down smoothly at the end and it's just amazing. But that's why I don't
[2:09:28.600 --> 2:09:32.600]  know how anybody can take a full turbo force. It's a pre workout also for people that want to
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:39.880]  work out or go on a long hike. It is it is rocket fuel. It is 40% off back in stock

[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:50.520]  and the left is so pathetic. They did last year an FBI investigation of power reviews
[2:10:51.160 --> 2:10:57.000]  thinking I never talked to power reviews as well respect in top group thinking that it was fake
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:03.720]  reviews can you imagine they want to put me in jail for fake reviews and hunter biden has sex

[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:18.520]  want to put me in jail for that I mean that that's the little side note that goes on around here
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:24.040]  that we find out from just everybody we work with anybody we work with anything we do gets
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:28.600]  harassed I'm surprised they haven't thrown us off power reviews but they didn't do that one

[2:14:19.080 --> 2:14:20.840]  you
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:41.320]  you know every day i see a new video of a black person attacking an asian person
[2:14:41.320 --> 2:14:46.040]  and i have the crowd statistics it's actually very rare for a black person to attack an asian
[2:14:46.040 --> 2:14:53.560]  person but there's 350 plus million people in this country and so out of the attacks that do happen
[2:14:54.120 --> 2:15:01.160]  the majority of attacks on asians are by asians on asians and then blacks on asians
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:06.280]  just like the majority of attacks on whites are by whites because whites are by whites
[2:15:06.280 --> 2:15:11.960]  and the next is black on white and it is true that it is black folks are committing about
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:16.280]  three times the crimes of any other group per capita that you don't blame another black person
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:20.840]  for that you don't blame somebody because they're great great great great great great grandfather
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:25.720]  was a slave owner or you don't blame somebody because their mama was a hooker or whatever
[2:15:27.080 --> 2:15:33.320]  but the point is is that in the inner cities blacks are killing each other number one and then
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:39.720]  they're attacking asians hispanics and then whites are actually down the line it goes hispanics asians
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:46.280]  and then and then whites and and i see videos of it every day and then i get to hear well but i
[2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:51.800]  don't i mean literally i'll i'll dial into cnn i watched cnn so you don't have to and i watched
[2:15:51.800 --> 2:15:56.120]  cnn probably 30 minutes a day i go to their website i click on the reports and i make myself
[2:15:56.120 --> 2:16:02.280]  look at it and every day it's uh there's a march against white supremacy in new york by the asian
[2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:08.760]  community and it's not a march by the asians against white supremacy they just why the asians
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:13.560]  are not marching so that white people don't attack them now do they get leftist asians on cnn and ms
[2:16:13.560 --> 2:16:20.200]  mbc to say yeah the whites are bad yeah it's it's it's it's bull ladies and gentlemen and and the
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:26.760]  reason i raise that is here's some of the articles video shows stranger attacking asian woman with
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:33.080]  hammer in new york city if that was a white person doing that you would hear white woman
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:40.600]  asian woman attacking new york city by stranger it'd be white woman demanding they remove mask
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:47.880]  one hit with a hammer so they try to spin it that oh it's anti-mask violence oh really yeah i saw a
[2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:54.120]  shoot out at outside a bar and they said oh anti-maskers attack masters it's the masters
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:17:01.720]  shooting the people so that's how the media put your enemies of the people spin every benefit
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:05.800]  you can see on the screen of your tv viewer i know which time will cast on radio that that was a
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:10.840]  white supremacist attack and and you hear that there's a record level white supremacist attacks
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:16.840]  it turns out the fbi illegally spied on millions of americans emails and i-clouds to see if they
[2:17:16.840 --> 2:17:21.720]  were white supremacists and now the adl just ruled that former president does not get to be
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:30.200]  on facebook the adl runs the board pretty crazy you know i call that nazi i call that soviet
[2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:36.200]  oh but i mean the adl is a jewish defense group so it can't be bad it's like oh
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:42.120]  a woman runs youtube so it's okay if she censors you it's all corrupt corporations hiding behind
[2:17:42.120 --> 2:17:47.960]  women and minorities and now the country that helped defeat hitler lives under hitler level
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:57.160]  controls run by the adl now that was seen in oh the white white supremacy and hate are haunting
[2:17:57.160 --> 2:18:07.880]  asian americans see an end i mean a load of bull white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the
[2:18:07.880 --> 2:18:17.160]  us dhs draft assessment says it's not an imminent earthquake on the west coast it's 10 years overdue
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:23.080]  or 12 years overdue it's not giant asteroids passing by the earth it's not super volcanoes it's not
[2:18:23.080 --> 2:18:31.720]  plagues it's not open borders it's not aging nuclear reactors no it's white people everybody's
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:38.200]  battling to get into countries built and run by white people and built by other people too but
[2:18:38.200 --> 2:18:42.120]  let's just say it everybody's used to want to come to the white countries because we're so
[2:18:42.120 --> 2:18:47.800]  bad and we're so mean and we're so evil and we're so terrible and we're just the word like it's like
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:54.280]  look at that river full of giant saltwater crocodiles they're 20 feet long let me just get in there
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:18:58.760]  let me just crocodiles are so nice let me just get in that water with them you don't see people
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:04.600]  getting in the water with crocodiles but oh the evil white people are just in america and europe
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:09.720]  let's get in there no matter what we do let's jump in the water with the piratas let's jump in the
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:18.520]  pit bulls starving to death a pit of doberman pinchers i mean it's america's so horrible so
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:25.560]  racist i gotta get there right now i gotta get next to those white devils right now
[2:19:29.080 --> 2:19:32.520]  well before christianity came to europe you didn't want to mess with the white devils because they
[2:19:32.520 --> 2:19:35.480]  were all killing each other and killing you and doing human sacrifices and everything else but
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:42.520]  it's christianity ladies and gentlemen and that's the key you've got african tribes where one tribe
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:19:47.160]  is 10 of the country in rwanda and they had 90 of the wealth because christians work together
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:50.920]  and then the animus go and kill them all with the un because they want things and it falls apart
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:55.560]  it's the same black people but one group's christian one group's not it's called christianity
[2:19:56.200 --> 2:20:00.200]  there are countries in south america basically run a couple of them by the amish you might have
[2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:05.400]  about 200 000 amish in a country of 20 million people which one's called the green hell might have
[2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:11.800]  us down there doing um uh medical donation work before he retired for dentistry he was talking
[2:20:11.800 --> 2:20:17.320]  about uruguay paraguay he said yeah the amish run it and they're the only ones that can you produce
[2:20:17.320 --> 2:20:22.760]  food or have any civilization or society and uh but the communists want to kill them all because
[2:20:22.760 --> 2:20:29.800]  they're white but i mean it's the christianity ladies and gentlemen but continuing summer 2021
[2:20:29.800 --> 2:20:36.280]  is going to be abnormally violent as murders continue to rise big paul joseph watson article
[2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:42.520]  and again what's the main reason lockdown people not having jobs and food prices going up
[2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:50.280]  76 percent look up about 30 right now but by the end of the summer 76 percent and it's just
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:21:03.560]  projected to continue up past 130 increase a year from now do you know what that's going to mean
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:08.920]  massive civil unrest and cnn is going to tell you imagine being the big megamax we're going
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:13.720]  to a reset we've devalued the currencies people's bank accounts are going to be worth half of what
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:18.440]  they were there's going to be shortages of items we'll let's just do it ourselves lock things down
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:23.480]  say it's a virus again people used to it before the collapse happens have a mini collapse out of
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:27.160]  the big collapse and then we have the main collapse will announce a new virus is out
[2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:30.600]  as another reason to lock people in their homes and others be worried about dying
[2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:36.200]  instead of how they lost everything and then we'll have black lives matter we'll find a few
[2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:39.880]  places where cops did something wrong or might have done something wrong and then we'll just
[2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:45.000]  burn things down they claim the economy imploded because of racial inequity in europe and the us
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:49.480]  will have arabs burn europe and north africans burn europe and we'll have the indigenous african
[2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:53.400]  americans you know been here 300 years or indigenous we'll have you burn it down under
[2:21:53.400 --> 2:21:59.640]  under chicken neck anti-foot direction and that's the whole plan but don't worry though the fbi says
[2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:06.920]  the white supremacist are hunting asians and haunting asians like cast for the friendly
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:14.600]  ghost friendliest ghost you know haunting them asian person goes out the door and i whoa i'm

[2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:25.240]  and attacking them they don't know what to do the white people
[2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:27.240]  oh
[2:22:32.760 --> 2:22:39.320]  mommy of course none of that's really happening even the usa today says that the asian community
[2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:43.400]  thinks i'm a hero we'll tell you about that we come back and i'm proud to think i'm a hero
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:48.600]  i'm trying to survive they did a big nsa spy drill and everybody found out the asians loved me

[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:57.240]  14 months ago i began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses the
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:26:03.240]  third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:09.000]  you shut down the first world it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:14.280]  really hurt the first world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the united states
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:18.760]  that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that can barely get the job done before
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:23.160]  delivering gas have been shut down plus the keystone pipeline's been shut down on one of
[2:26:23.160 --> 2:26:28.920]  the other pipelines the left is now blowing up dams across the us we're being shut down our
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:34.120]  coal power plants are off as well ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  world is imploding as well the borders have been removed until you wake up this is a globalist
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:43.320]  chai-com takeover Gregory said you have no hope they're announcing that there will be less than
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:48.760]  two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:59.720]  and CNN laughed at you and your family you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:27:08.120 --> 2:27:12.120]  and then one day with the customer bought the indian mate
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:18.120]  he took her so far away no collider state collider
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:31.320]  and then lots of man's can be now just pushing he was telling all my friends
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:47.320]  poor old collider
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:28:01.320]  I'm worried about nick pointes
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:09.720]  I said I talked to him this morning he I woke up this morning at 5 a.m and saw a text from him
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:14.920]  saying great I'll be on your show tomorrow announce the lawsuit against TSA put me on the no fly list
[2:28:14.920 --> 2:28:25.880]  with norm patis and will announce it at 1 p.m and then I thought or the camera guy the boom operator
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:31.640]  thought john thought hey he tweets all the time let's go see you last time he tweeted last time
[2:28:31.640 --> 2:28:38.440]  he tweeted 11 hours ago so nick pointes is not a flaky guy I've known him a couple years he shows
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:44.520]  up when he says he is he does what he says he's gonna do maybe he forgot maybe maybe he was in
[2:28:44.520 --> 2:28:49.000]  a car wreck maybe his mom a family member needed help or something I don't know but
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:53.400]  they put him on a no fly list that usually happens right before they arrest you
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:56.120]  and the less than calling for his arrest everywhere
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:01.800]  so we hope that he is okay
[2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:09.000]  and there's the video proves on no fly list that's the pin tweet April 27th let's keep
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:18.440]  scrolling down please and we'll show folks the last tweet 11 hours ago hey bff pod so how does
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:24.600]  this work for you d and me or I will you link and that's just something he sent out nick pointes
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:32.680]  on total narrative control and then he's gone okay so that's it hopefully he has not been
[2:29:32.680 --> 2:29:40.440]  scooped up by the Gestapo or the NKVD you know by the way I don't know whether you
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:48.120]  should call the FBI now the KGB the NKVD or the Gestapo because are they more like Nazis or are
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:54.680]  they more like the Soviets and I'd lean more towards the Soviets so say FSB KGB whatever
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:30:01.880]  name you want to give it except Soros is one of their top guys and he was a Nazi collaborator
[2:30:01.880 --> 2:30:08.040]  you're like well he was younger he did that well he used the the Nazi party of Ukraine to
[2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:12.520]  blow up police stations to shoot everybody and and and and a coalition government took over
[2:30:12.520 --> 2:30:18.920]  and the media of course ignored that and now in Orban's country over in uh what is it Hungary
[2:30:20.600 --> 2:30:27.480]  Victor Orban they have a coalition government to get him out with the Nazi party I mean it's
[2:30:27.480 --> 2:30:32.840]  just the left like walk around and go we're intellectuals we're smart we fight Nazis and then
[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:38.840]  apple runs death camps they're just the scum of the earth and and the low level left doesn't
[2:30:38.840 --> 2:30:52.520]  is not intellectual they are usually perverts that have like two or three degrees that are worthless
[2:30:52.520 --> 2:30:57.480]  who are pissed at their degrees are worthless and they're lazy and they always keep thinking once
[2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:04.920]  the communist takeover happens then they'll have all this power yeah there's some of the apple
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:09.560]  factories over there where they have suicide nets around them I mean this is not a joke folks so
[2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:15.880]  let's go ahead and talk about this you saw CNN that white people are hunting Asians white people
[2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:22.280]  white people are haunting Asians that Alex Jones is a white supremacist well here here's USA today
[2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:27.720]  proud boys saw a wave of contributions from Chinese
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:33.480]  dyspora that's like one of the people you know flee a country before capital attack
[2:31:34.360 --> 2:31:40.440]  and it goes on to say when the proud boys got stabbed they know this because USA they used hackers
[2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:44.440]  to hack into the donation sites that the left does to find out who the evil people were
[2:31:44.440 --> 2:31:52.680]  and throughout the majority of the donators were anti-communist Chinese americans who by the way
[2:31:52.680 --> 2:31:56.520]  are up in one of the highest income brackets lowest crime rate brackets some great citizens
[2:31:58.200 --> 2:32:03.960]  and it goes on to like why were there's donations to this well the surprising answer to the question
[2:32:03.960 --> 2:32:08.440]  is that the proud boys enjoyed significant support from a slice of the chinese american community
[2:32:08.440 --> 2:32:15.960]  and the broader chinese dyspora some chinese americans have bought into the rhetoric
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:21.080]  spread by the proud boys conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones and conservative commentators
[2:32:21.080 --> 2:32:27.080]  that america is under attack from communism oh but of course there is no violence from
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:32.280]  anti-fight it doesn't exist and there's no communism either here's just Joe Biden working
[2:32:32.280 --> 2:32:38.760]  with the chicoms they believe the proud boys are the vanguard of protecting the country
[2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:43.720]  from a communist army controlled by anti-fight and black lives matter when the founders say
[2:32:43.720 --> 2:32:47.880]  they're marxist claims that have been widely debunked widely debunked like saying
[2:32:49.560 --> 2:32:53.320]  roger stalback claimed he played for the cowboys back in the 1960s
[2:32:53.320 --> 2:33:03.160]  it's amazing or the chicago bears claim they're in chicago
[2:33:06.200 --> 2:33:13.880]  i mean it's just the level of the gaslighting so that communism doesn't exist that is happening
[2:33:14.440 --> 2:33:19.400]  for some who left china in rejection of communism particularly those who support
[2:33:19.400 --> 2:33:23.960]  former president Donald trump the proud boys have taken on an almost mythical status as tough
[2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:29.240]  street soldiers on the front lines of the battle between democracy and communism i mean what do
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:40.120]  you think it is i mean what do you think is going on here and it goes on from there the proud boys
[2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:45.560]  were taking innocent people said donald wang a queen's new york resident who donated fifty dollars a
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:51.560]  lot of people in my community support them and it goes on to attack us and and again they got all
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:55.960]  this by hacking into a donation site to find out the majority were chinese citizens of the u.s
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:02.440]  oh because they want to drive away between chinese and white people in asian periods like
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:06.120]  don't you know you're being hunted by the white people oh yeah the asians really buy into that
[2:34:06.120 --> 2:34:09.960]  they really are buying into you seeing and they they really they're so stupid they believe you
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:16.920]  proud boys chairman in ricketario claimed that his group primarily exists to protect american
[2:34:16.920 --> 2:34:21.480]  citizens from anarchists and communists aligned with the antifa movement who are trying to overthrow
[2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:25.320]  the u.s government well asians have had a lot of their businesses burnt lately i know it's mostly
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:31.160]  peaceful and they get burned down or killed but you know the refrain is common in the far right
[2:34:31.160 --> 2:34:36.680]  media and social media conspiracy mongers such as jones and his british counterpart paul's is watching
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:43.160]  whip their viewers into a frenzy of distrust and fear contending that socialists and antifa
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:50.200]  assassins are about to attack mainstream americans the message has been amplified by fox who's
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:55.320]  turker girlson who has called for anti fascist activists to be labeled as terrorist well trump
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:59.880]  did label was that he called black lives matter movement poison but what do all the democrats
[2:34:59.880 --> 2:35:05.960]  say fox is the only place not doing it cnn msnbc congressman nadler what do they all say they go
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:13.880]  antifa doesn't exist just like i'll tell you communism doesn't exist no it's just taken over
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:19.240]  any weekend you know downtown austin there'll be 200 300 communists marked around
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:24.440]  always trying to get black people to burn something down so they can say it's a black

[2:39:06.200 --> 2:39:10.360]  the quality to get a lot of these and so that's why we don't have a lot of products in that's why
[2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:14.520]  info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the products you would be buying it we
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:18.920]  have the money but so many of them have been sold out just like you notice a lot of other items at

[2:40:00.200 --> 2:40:04.280]  credibility but i don't care about that i care about beating the new world order and it's because

[2:45:45.880 --> 2:45:54.520]  seconds a goldfish it's 14.7 not joking in major study they're gone folks nobody's home
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:45:59.800]  they don't care about logic they care about the idea of something to them perception is
[2:45:59.800 --> 2:46:05.960]  reality not reality you can perceive that you're an elephant you can perceive that you're ickerness
[2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:11.960]  you can't fly to the sun you can perceive that you're a mother when you're a man you can perceive
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:16.840]  that you're a man when you're a woman but you're not and no one's against you that you have
[2:46:16.840 --> 2:46:21.800]  proclivities to select you're a man our biology is very similar we have some of the same programming
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:28.200]  no one's judging you i don't judge people for their heart god does that but i do judge you
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:34.440]  when you have your kids and you know that's something i didn't do and it's such a nightmare
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:40.760]  stack and i've got a great guest house coming up who she was so impressive when she was on uh with us
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:48.440]  last week but i've got to get to this metaphor news i mean it's bad folks they are taking the
[2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:57.160]  autistic children the mentally retarded children they are taking the foster children and the majority
[2:46:57.160 --> 2:47:03.160]  of foster children in major liberal jurisdictions are now transitioning girls to boys boys to girls
[2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:07.320]  and really what it is is sterilization they have to make sterilization fashionable oh so they're
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:11.400]  convincing three-year-olds to sign documents of their free will even though you're not of age
[2:47:11.400 --> 2:47:18.600]  so you're really 18 make things like that to sign up for a trajectory by age seven to have the genitals
[2:47:18.600 --> 2:47:24.280]  surgically removed but by age five to begin the chemicals to block it which is so deadly to your
[2:47:24.280 --> 2:47:32.520]  body and that is the interesting filler who's got 500 plus children as young as three under him
[2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:37.720]  who are now transitioning and of course they were taken by cps from their parents some cases
[2:47:37.720 --> 2:47:41.640]  from bad places but obviously put worse i mean imagine you can take it from your dad who's a
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:47.960]  drunk that broke your arm you're four years old and guess what you live with this person's thing
[2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:54.840]  that teach you all about sex and all about hiv and what his books teach you and all about how
[2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:58.840]  you're gonna be a beautiful girl never you're gonna be a big strong man you're gonna be a big
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.120]  strong woman here no no no no no no you get attention and it's fun and you're in the cool club
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:11.320]  when we get that little peepee cut off all right and then girls we can finish you to take chemicals
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:16.200]  or fry your uterus and those eggs we don't and you know the argument is well these are disadvantaged
[2:48:16.200 --> 2:48:22.760]  children you know see my film in game there's a clip of the texas board of medicine and they say look
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:29.240]  we put kids on the average of 14 socket or 12 socket tropics because they have bad gene pools
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:35.560]  they're poor they deserve to be sterilized basically and so make them happy make it cool to be sterilized
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:40.440]  you know hitler sterilized the mentally retarded and stuff he just did it and said you're subhuman
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:47.640]  but man the liberals know how to do it so cool a nice effeminate man or a man dressed like a woman
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:53.480]  comes you and says oh remember remember what the white house you know appointees he failed appointment
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:49:00.040]  dross and all are said ah we need school teachers and parents on a stand master basis good
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:05.960]  where's the elementary students and the children and she goes ah ah we gotta find that recording
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:10.120]  that they've purged it everywhere rush one ball used to play it i mean she she gave it the speech
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:14.120]  and then that was pre-internets they purged it the quotes are there like the new york times
[2:49:14.120 --> 2:49:19.960]  watched it post they defended it and she said you need to go into the nurseries and touch them
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:27.480]  the teachers need to do it to the staff they get over it it's not help them touch their genitals
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:33.240]  so oh they're touching genitals now with these mRNA vaccine he's gonna fry that uterus
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:45.160]  li-baro whoo and it's gonna get so much more fun somebody mail me it somebody's
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:51.080]  gotta have a limbaugh from like that was like rotman clinton got in in 1993 he was trying to
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:56.280]  appoint her as a surgeon general i've heard it played and i can't i think c-span has it
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:01.880]  in the archives search for that i did try we need to restart on and touch their peepies

[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:50.600]  they're attacking humanity i've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given
[2:51:50.600 --> 2:51:55.720]  the globalists one hell overrun for their money because of god and i know some of our listeners
[2:51:55.720 --> 2:51:59.480]  get mad when i talk about god all day but just give me a break the statinism's out in the open
[2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:04.520]  i've always been a christian but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil is so clear
[2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:08.440]  and i get it a lot of you have been turned off by big churches a lot of you have been turned off by
[2:52:08.440 --> 2:52:14.360]  the corrupt priest class system and i get it me too believe me i'm one of them but it's that
[2:52:14.360 --> 2:52:20.680]  relationship with god and just god's universe that god created that is so essential and and
[2:52:20.680 --> 2:52:25.640]  god created the universe for us to have communion with god through and to have life and so that's

[2:53:38.920 --> 2:53:54.840]  survived and you can say vice versa i'm the wrath that you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:54:09.240 --> 2:54:21.720]  dr jane ruby is set to take over in t-minus five minutes 51 seconds so definitely look for that
[2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:26.440]  let me hit a few final stories on the whole covid-19 power grab takeover that's taking place
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:33.480]  here's one there is no secret Pfizer document about the covid-19 vaccine shedding in women
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:40.040]  and this is out of just one of these substack.com so-called news sites that are
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:46.200]  paying by big pharma in most cases dispute this info but anybody can go to Pfizer
[2:54:46.760 --> 2:54:51.160]  in their public trials and saying we think this could shed and this could hurt pregnant women
[2:54:51.160 --> 2:54:55.080]  or breastfeeding women that so so you're right there isn't a secret document because there's
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:55:00.200]  a public document and i was just showing you that document yesterday so that's the top of games
[2:55:00.200 --> 2:55:06.440]  that these yahoo's play and it just goes on from there FDA to authorize Pfizer covid-19 vaccine
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:12.200]  for 12 to 15 year olds and now they're announcing that a lot of people
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:18.360]  are planning to never take the mask off we'll see it into that a year ago they said
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:27.320]  it will end up being just like a seatbelt you will wear them all the time you wore them in the
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:31.880]  water you will you will you will not dance you will not you will you will do what we say when
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:37.320]  we say and these people all subservently subserviently do it because they've been trained and they've
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:44.280]  been domesticated to accept this yeah let's roll this footage of Kamala Harris kissing her beard
[2:55:44.280 --> 2:55:48.360]  husband and i'm not saying she's a lesbian i'm saying it's a political marriage yeah show that
[2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:59.240]  kissing through the mask and they're both vaccinated and he was seeing it's like hey maybe
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:03.960]  you should take the mask off people aren't taking the vaccine because of this they plan to never take
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:09.080]  the mask off it's a sign of subservience a sign that you're under their control that's what Tucker
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:12.840]  Carlson's right they're trying to force will be inoculate us take our jobs away bully us
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:16.760]  and then he says just tell people that the mask give you back to your old ammonia and don't really
[2:56:16.760 --> 2:56:21.560]  work and it's abusive in children or psychological studies they oh my god he's terrorizing us he's
[2:56:21.560 --> 2:56:26.920]  in our face he's getting us when you've got the Bill and the Gates Foundation calling for the Pentagon
[2:56:26.920 --> 2:56:32.680]  to use cyber counterterrorism and the military on us and of course that's just their dream they're
[2:56:32.680 --> 2:56:38.040]  pushing that you know the Trump supporters are secretly planning a new attack we've got to stop
[2:56:38.040 --> 2:56:42.360]  them right now if you're a new listener in Spain and England they're saying don't look at people in
[2:56:42.360 --> 2:56:50.360]  the eyes turn away exhale underwater wear mask underwater in DC they're saying don't stand or
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:56.840]  dance at a wedding they're saying still don't sing at church it's all to see how much ridiculous
[2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:03.560]  crap they can feed you seeing a feeding us crap here's clip nine why some vaccinated people
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:09.560]  keep wearing their masks CNN's coddling them here it is we have some viewer questions for you Sanjay
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:14.280]  and the first one is is honestly I think one of the most asked questions now and it's very much in
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:21.480]  the public discourse this question is do we still need to wear masks outside particularly Sanjay if
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:29.480]  you're vaccinated why and should vaccinated people still wear masks outside yeah so let me let me
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:35.800]  try and answer it this way I think that the vast majority of viral transmission excuse me is not
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:42.360]  happening outside in fact we we put together some of the numbers the fact that overall if you look
[2:57:42.360 --> 2:57:47.720]  at new cases of people becoming infected fewer than 10 percent are happening outdoors this is all
[2:57:47.720 --> 2:57:52.120]  neurotic BS John you may remember this is a statistic we shared from the lockdown states have
[2:57:52.120 --> 2:57:58.360]  the highest levels viral transmission and fighting that it's about close to 19 times less likely to
[2:57:58.360 --> 2:58:04.280]  happen outdoors versus indoors so what are the fact just shut him up here's the old it's all
[2:58:04.280 --> 2:58:08.360]  bold they create a false dialectic where he's like you don't have to really wear it outside
[2:58:08.360 --> 2:58:12.360]  but if house he says well you still better and have your kids do it okay and we better shoot
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:18.440]  up newborn babies too it's so evil it's always about how far they can push and then he's like
[2:58:18.440 --> 2:58:23.720]  well maybe you cannot wear a mask outside and he's the good cop it's like Caitlyn Jenner oh great
[2:58:23.720 --> 2:58:29.240]  he says we shouldn't have men and girls sports it's okay he's a dude to dress it's all dialectics
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:33.480]  it's all moving an overton window but they're like let's give our children a convicted pedophiles
[2:58:33.480 --> 2:58:40.120]  well no let's just let our children meet with convicted pedophiles see all right special guest

[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:59.080]  is getting this injection i can't stop them or my my mother got it now i have to live with her is
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:03.240]  it safe so we're going to get into a lot of that but i want to ask you to start thinking about a
[3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:11.320]  question like this if you knew there were cures for covet 19 or any illness if you knew the
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:17.400]  infection numbers you were being told for the last 18 months were faith numbers you know would you
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:23.080]  have complied with the masks would you would you think even considered getting injected with these
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:30.120]  experimental uh devices would you say have stayed at home and left your businesses would you have
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:37.560]  abided by these nonsense mandates probably not um time is running out and i know if you watch the
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:44.120]  previous segments with alex and dr mercola who i've been studying and working with for years uh
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:49.960]  you'll know that we only have a limited amount of time but we also have to replace the fear
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:54.680]  with hope and with intelligence and with information and that's what we're going to try to do here
[3:02:54.680 --> 3:03:03.560]  today so one of the things i wanted to share with you is this issue of uh the Pfizer leaked document
[3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:11.080]  now when this issue about shedding or transmitting something from injected people to non-injected
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:17.720]  people started circulating recently uh there's been a lot of pushback on that and in the meantime
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:25.080]  Pfizer actually i don't know how it was leaked but there was a document called the vaccine trial
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:31.320]  documentation it references if you can believe this knowledge of the shedding uh i wanted to
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:36.840]  read you some excerpts from it i know we have uh some of the sections from the document that we
[3:03:36.840 --> 3:03:42.440]  might be able to put up here but in the meantime let me sort of summarize what that document said
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:49.320]  it basically stated and these are internal documents to uh from internal you know corporate
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:56.280]  people to the investigators one of them was if a man who was not vaccinated touches a vaccinated
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:03.080]  woman or breathes any air that she breathes uh and then he has sex with his own wife his wife
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:09.560]  can have an adverse event and possibly should avoid having children and we're not sure how long
[3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:16.680]  that lasts but let me let me list for you some of the dangers miscarriage spontaneous abortion
[3:04:16.680 --> 3:04:21.800]  which is which is actually a technical word for miscarry uh poisoning babies through breast milk
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:28.520]  and and babies ending up developing cognitive difficulties another section talked about something
[3:04:28.520 --> 3:04:35.560]  called occupational exposure an occupational exposure occurs when a person receives an unplanned
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:40.840]  i love how they word it an unplanned direct contact with a vaccine test subject
[3:04:41.720 --> 3:04:47.000]  which may or may not lead to an occurrence of an adverse event but here's the kicker that
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:53.880]  i want you to be aware of at the bottom of that document it clearly says when such exposures happen
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:59.080]  the investigator you know there are many multiple sites in the trial these trials that don't end
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:05.160]  until 2023 are occurring all over the world but all over our country at different research sites
[3:05:05.160 --> 3:05:13.080]  so when any of this occurs and a person receives an unplanned direct contact and they and they incur
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:19.560]  an adverse event the investigator of that trial that particular site getting that report from a
[3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:26.520]  patient uh must report those to Pfizer within 24 hours which is standard of becoming aware of
[3:05:26.520 --> 3:05:32.200]  them happening but the bottom of the document says and this is the dangerous part since this
[3:05:32.200 --> 3:05:39.960]  information does not pertain to a participant in involved in the study the information will be kept
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:45.800]  separate from the study they're basically telling you that they're hiding this information i think
[3:05:45.800 --> 3:05:51.160]  this is incredibly dangerous it's in alignment with everything that alex has warned you about
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:57.000]  i'm going to share with you some excerpts from some of the emails that you sent to me this week
[3:05:57.000 --> 3:06:03.960]  at drjane at protonmail.com in one of our other segments but in the meantime in summary there
[3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:11.160]  were at least 50 people who wrote to me to tell me that they or their spouse the woman or if it was
[3:06:11.160 --> 3:06:18.520]  a man their spouse incurred a miscarriage within 30 days of either getting the injection or being
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:24.360]  exposed to someone who got the injection that they were living in close proximity with so i've
[3:06:24.360 --> 3:06:30.200]  had a lot of questions around should i be with my family if they've had this um should i go visit
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:36.280]  my parents should i avoid them and if i do avoid them how long for how long should i avoid them
[3:06:37.160 --> 3:06:41.720]  some of those questions we're still digging into but i think it's really important that
[3:06:41.720 --> 3:06:48.200]  we're getting so many reports and if you look at the VAERS section of the cdc website which is the
[3:06:48.200 --> 3:06:54.760]  vaccine adverse event reporting system you'll see that these types of reports are coming in they're
[3:06:54.760 --> 3:07:00.600]  actually doubling and tripling um we'll have those numbers uh in a subsequent section but for
[3:07:00.600 --> 3:07:07.400]  now i wanted you to understand that something is happening with the uninjected that the injected
[3:07:07.400 --> 3:07:13.160]  people are having some sort of an effect on and i want to be scientifically responsible about it i
[3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:18.200]  want to keep leaning on experts that are a little more informed than me and a little closer to this
[3:07:18.200 --> 3:07:25.720]  to see uh really if this is happening uh and what might be causing it and how we can protect ourselves
[3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:30.520]  from it because that was the biggest concern of all the people that wrote to me they they were
[3:07:30.520 --> 3:07:35.960]  very concerned about how they could protect themselves from it uh the other issue i wanted
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:41.640]  to share with you that i think is of great concern is that you're probably hearing more and more
[3:07:41.640 --> 3:07:47.480]  than employers especially private companies i've mentioned this on the show before myself
[3:07:47.480 --> 3:07:53.960]  are putting pressure on either current employees or prospective employees to get these injections
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:08:01.320]  and complete vaccine forms or software apps that document their vaccination which is the
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:07.800]  beginning of an internal employer's vaccine trans uh passport if you will i think this is
[3:08:07.800 --> 3:08:13.800]  incredibly dangerous i don't think that it's 100 legal we're going to talk about that with my guest
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:20.280]  in the second and third segments but the other issue that's coming up around that and why you
[3:08:20.280 --> 3:08:27.000]  need to be informed on it is that the insurance companies that provide your health care insurance
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:34.520]  your life insurance your long-term and short-term disability in your corporate sponsored benefits
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:40.200]  are now pulling back and saying hey we want indemnity from these injections but now we
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.680]  have a little bit of a conflict of interest because if companies are forcing you to either
[3:08:44.680 --> 3:08:49.560]  show proof that you've had a vaccination or that you are going to uh within a certain
[3:08:49.560 --> 3:08:54.760]  timeframe in order to keep your job your paycheck and your livelihood to take care of your family
[3:08:54.760 --> 3:09:01.560]  you're also going to be out of any insurance if you should succumb to the pressure and you get ill
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:07.480]  or if you die unexpectedly your benefits will not apply so i think this is really dangerous i think
[3:09:07.480 --> 3:09:13.400]  the american public needs to stay on it uh i'm going to talk to our upcoming guest about it i'm
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:17.720]  thrilled uh to have him i'm going to give him a brief introduction now because i don't want to
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:22.680]  take any time away from him speaking his name is dr david martin if you haven't seen him yet
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:28.440]  he's a spokesperson for global financial and intangible asset accountability and quality
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:33.560]  reform he's worked very closely with congress and he's a baton fellow at the university of virginia
[3:09:33.560 --> 3:09:39.640]  virginia's darden graduate school he's working to make those accountable for this covet injection
[3:09:39.640 --> 3:09:46.040]  lie and everything that's about around lies about this vaccination uh accountable and i'm really
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:53.000]  thrilled to be talking to him so stay with me we'll be right back it is a big idea a new world order
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:59.720]  in the near future earth is dominated by a powerful world
[3:10:00.600 --> 3:10:07.880]  is known as the builder bird could their objective be world domination for thousands of years their
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:14.920]  dark order group now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating
[3:10:14.920 --> 3:10:21.240]  80 percent of humanity is in hand the globalist fear this film made 14 years ago it is the blueprint
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:25.160]  for their plan to figure with the world it is the blueprint for the great reset it is in game
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:29.880]  blueprint for global enslavement available right now at info or store dot com with a zero country
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:34.440]  code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world i strongly suggest you get the film
[3:10:34.440 --> 3:10:39.400]  in game at info or store dot com i strongly suggest you make copies and share it and if you take
[3:10:39.400 --> 3:10:43.800]  that action i demand you tell others that you've given a copy to that they make copies and share it
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:50.040]  as well that will trigger distribution by proxy meaning we the people cannot be stopped so what's
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:54.600]  the most important part let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist the treads the wheels
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:59.560]  the engine the scoop on the front it's all very important but the fuel is paramount and that's
[3:10:59.560 --> 3:11:05.880]  my allegory parabolic force is vitamins minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:10.760]  different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic
[3:11:10.760 --> 3:11:14.600]  system metabolism of a human some people get 15 hours out of some people get about eight hours
[3:11:14.600 --> 3:11:18.760]  but people take this people take in sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:25.320]  because it's not high nobody puts as much product into their pre workouts their post-workout you

[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:22.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:31.880]  welcome back everyone to the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm your guest host today
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:39.000]  dr jane ruby and i'm thrilled to be talking with my personal guest dr david martin dr martin
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:47.720]  welcome to the show lovely to be here and lovely to see you thanks judy absolutely uh dr martin
[3:12:47.720 --> 3:12:54.680]  i'm i'm just thrilled to have you here uh listen i you had me at this is not a vaccine so i just i
[3:12:54.680 --> 3:13:00.360]  know you want to get a couple of great topics to see after that we're going to cover but i really
[3:13:00.360 --> 3:13:05.480]  wanted you to explain to people you were really overusing this term vaccine and i loved the way
[3:13:05.480 --> 3:13:10.680]  you you articulated it so please help people understand how and why this is not a vaccine
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:18.680]  well for starters i think it's important for us to realize that the reason why i say it is because
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:28.520]  maderna itself said it in their sec filings which have been reproduced many times in many environments
[3:13:28.520 --> 3:13:36.360]  they make it abundantly clear that the mrna technology is considered by the fda to be gene therapy
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:42.600]  and they have been very clear in fact it's it's worth making sure that everybody gets it
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:49.240]  straight from the horse's mouth currently mrna is considered a gene therapy product by the fda
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:55.400]  unlike certain gene therapies that are irreversibly altering cell dna and could act as a source of
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:02.040]  side effect mrna based medicines you'll notice that they're they're this is their game right
[3:14:02.040 --> 3:14:07.160]  they are the ones saying this so let's make it abundantly clear this is not us going out on a
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:14.840]  limb mrna medicines are considered gene therapies by the fda and they make the point in all of their
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:24.040]  sec filings to make it abundantly clear that no mrna product has ever been approved by the fda so
[3:14:24.040 --> 3:14:29.400]  so this is one of those things where the best place to go is straight to the horse's mouth
[3:14:30.120 --> 3:14:36.760]  they're the ones that say it is a gene therapy they're the ones that say the fda calls it a
[3:14:36.760 --> 3:14:43.480]  gene therapy and they're the ones that say that there has been no approval for mrna products
[3:14:44.040 --> 3:14:50.280]  and so what we're left with is a very simple observation which is that's what it is it's
[3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:56.760]  what they say it is right and and the definition of a vaccine really has more to do with conferring
[3:14:56.760 --> 3:15:01.880]  immunity and resulting in antibodies that will keep you protected protected with a surveillance
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:10.040]  system this is not that it's a methodical right yeah so so listen once again let's go to the
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:17.640]  horse's mouth i love to hang them on their own language the world health organization in 2016
[3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:25.960]  and it recapitulated this in 2018 made it abundantly clear that there is a guideline for what a
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:33.640]  vaccine is and a vaccine does one of three things it actually blocks transmission which means it
[3:15:33.640 --> 3:15:39.960]  disrupts the transmission of a virus or a pathogen it stops someone from being infected
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:47.960]  so that's the other option it is or it may be a treatment of a disease meaning that it
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:54.760]  actually blocks the expression of a pathogen manifesting into a disease that's what the
[3:15:54.760 --> 3:16:01.320]  world health organization in their own published report has said a vaccine is the clinical trial
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:07.560]  that phyzer did the clinical trial that maderna did and the clinical trial that johnson and johnson
[3:16:07.560 --> 3:16:15.400]  did did not measure any of those outcomes specifically need to get clear on the fact
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:22.520]  that for it to be a vaccine and not a medical device treatment which is what it in fact it is
[3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:30.360]  for it to be a vaccine it actually has a world health organization definition standard
[3:16:30.360 --> 3:16:37.880]  that the clinical trials were set up not to me and this in fact i've heard you speak on a number
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:44.280]  of panels in your fellow panelists as well have confirmed that this is actually a producing a
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:50.120]  pathogen which is a disease causing entity we've all heard of the spikes and that it's forcing
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:56.200]  your system to make is this happening in every cell and is it reversible yeah so so this is a
[3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:01.560]  so this is a great question and dr g one of the things that bothers me about the official
[3:17:01.560 --> 3:17:07.400]  propaganda i mean we actually have let's let's let's once again go back to horses mouths i
[3:17:07.400 --> 3:17:14.440]  i love giving them their own language this is from um roiders today britain's health department says
[3:17:14.440 --> 3:17:21.720]  quote covid vaccines are the best way to protect people from corona virus now what's wrong with
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:28.440]  that statement it is in fact a lie let's call it what it is roiders is lying and the british
[3:17:28.440 --> 3:17:35.720]  public health official is lying there is nothing about what is being injected into people that
[3:17:35.720 --> 3:17:46.600]  actually disrupts corona virus the virus it is in fact a way to turn your cells into a manufacturing
[3:17:46.600 --> 3:17:53.320]  mechanism to manufacture a pathogen which then you are allegedly supposed to build immunity to
[3:17:53.320 --> 3:18:01.240]  but here's the problem with the theory we don't know whether it in fact disrupts anything about
[3:18:01.240 --> 3:18:09.160]  sar's c o v two and we don't know that because it never was part of the clinical research
[3:18:09.160 --> 3:18:17.960]  this is a device let's get really clear this is a computer simulated program injected into your body
[3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:25.640]  that's exactly their words it is a strand of computer simulated proteins that is injected
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:36.200]  into your body to turn on your body's manufacturing of a spike protein and your body becomes a factory
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:43.960]  generating the pathogen that gives rise to what they alleged to be an immunity but at no point
[3:18:44.680 --> 3:18:50.040]  has this clinical trial ever shown a disruption of infection by sar's c o v two
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:58.200]  never once never once has it shown a prohibition of infection by sar's c o v two
[3:18:58.920 --> 3:19:05.480]  and never once has it been shown to actually have anything to do with disrupting transmission
[3:19:05.480 --> 3:19:13.880]  so when the cdc the fda and all mainstream media say that this is a way to block coronavirus
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:20.760]  they're lying and there is no wiggle room around it you know we just have about another minute
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:28.360]  but i do want to ask you what your thoughts are people are they're starting to get all this now
[3:19:28.360 --> 3:19:33.080]  they want to know about going forward um are they going to be able to for those who have taken it
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:37.880]  will they be able to get it out of their bodies you know there's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:42.600]  what the body does to something that you put inside of it what is our body do you have any
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:47.800]  interest or information right now on what our bodies are doing to this and what what the outcome
[3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:53.080]  will be for people and just about a quick minute yeah it wasn't really quick and we'll come back
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:58.840]  to this because it's so important the fact of the matter is we don't have data on exactly the
[3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:03.800]  pharmacokinetics of clearing this we've been told that it's safe we've been told the body
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:11.320]  processes it and it doesn't transmute into other things but the project that gave rise to maderna
[3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:17.640]  and this goes back to the the beginning of maderna the darwinian chemical systems national science

[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:29.240]  guest host for today dr jane ruby and we're going to continue our discussion with an amazing man
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:34.680]  dr david martin who's our guest dr martin i wanted to you know i mentioned dr fauci before you have
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:41.080]  been dogged with him you traced all the money as you've said you're an international financial
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:47.320]  expert it all goes back to him in his dirty dealings you're exposing a lot are you ever afraid for
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:54.840]  your own security and safety no in fact it's really important for us to be clear on the fact
[3:25:54.840 --> 3:26:02.840]  that that as humanity we have to realize that we're in this together and and so you know like every
[3:26:02.840 --> 3:26:08.120]  part of you know the the human anatomy you know we have to have things that kind of take the heat
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:12.680]  and we have some things that we want to protect a little more some of us are configured to take a
[3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:18.280]  little more heat some of us are configured not to take as much heat and i happen to have i don't
[3:26:18.280 --> 3:26:25.240]  know i i guess i was born with a thick hide um the fact of the matter is i have been very careful
[3:26:25.240 --> 3:26:33.800]  to make sure that what i say is 100 substantiated on evidence and facts and because of that you
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:41.000]  know it's funny after being outspoken for as many years as i've been outspoken i have still not been
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  deplatformed i have not had any of the content that i've been at putting out there taken down
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:55.080]  down except for ironically the announcement of this publication now this publication the Fauci
[3:26:55.080 --> 3:27:02.040]  dossier okay which all of you can download it's on on the internet if you put put my name and
[3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:08.440]  Fauci dossier in the internet you'll you'll find it but when i announced that youtube took that
[3:27:08.440 --> 3:27:16.200]  video down but i have now over 150 videos up where i talk about all of the investigations we've done
[3:27:16.200 --> 3:27:23.080]  starting in 1999 when we started weaponizing coronavirus at the university of north carolina
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:30.760]  chapel hill when anthony fowci decided to take a pathogen and turn it into a human weapon when
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:41.880]  that took place and when in 2015 and 2016 anthony fowci broke the will of america that gained a
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:47.640]  function moratorium broke that in collaboration with the university of north carolina and published
[3:27:48.200 --> 3:27:57.480]  in 2016 an article in which he said the wuhan virus was and i quote poised for human emergence
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:04.440]  let me say that again in 2016 anthony fowci's funded research at university north carolina
[3:28:04.440 --> 3:28:13.320]  chapel hill stated that the wuhan virus was posed for poised for human emergence we have to understand
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:19.960]  this guy has been running a criminal conspiracy defrauding the united states interest selling
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:27.640]  out the united states interest to the chinese and doing at the highest paid executive level
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:34.520]  in the federal government the top dog in total payment in this country has been selling out
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:43.880]  this country since 1999 dr martin um the this is like a runaway train i think you and i both
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:50.360]  know and many other people who are familiar with the pharmaceutical drug process uh if if this is
[3:28:50.360 --> 3:28:57.000]  going this is headed toward fda approval in spite of the outrageousness and the crime uh that is
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:03.400]  going to be a major game changer what what are your thoughts around that well i think that they
[3:29:03.400 --> 3:29:09.560]  are they the pharmaceutical companies involved in this are actually acutely aware that there's
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:16.440]  going to have to be some pretty significant legal changes to the fda standards for there to be a
[3:29:16.440 --> 3:29:22.760]  proper approval under the emergency use authorization you get a lot of wiggle room and what goes into
[3:29:22.760 --> 3:29:28.280]  clinical trials what endpoints are and so forth but for listeners at home and around the world
[3:29:28.280 --> 3:29:35.960]  it's important for us to realize that up until now whether it's m m r whether it's h p v whether
[3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:45.400]  it's any of these other clinical trials on viruses all of them have required proof of serology meaning
[3:29:45.400 --> 3:29:51.080]  that you actually are having an immune response stimulated in the body all of them have required
[3:29:51.080 --> 3:30:00.280]  biochemistry as part of the clinical outcomes this is the first time in any vaccine clinical trial
[3:30:00.280 --> 3:30:08.440]  where the intervention has been authorized not approved on symptom mitigation alone and that
[3:30:08.440 --> 3:30:15.480]  is not a standard that the fda can approve so the the good news and the bad news is that we
[3:30:15.480 --> 3:30:23.400]  actually have the law on our side and we have the ability to say that the will of the supreme court
[3:30:23.400 --> 3:30:30.440]  determinations around vaccines the will of congress around vaccines have in fact not been the standard
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:37.800]  of the clinical trials so far so i'm actually pretty optimistic that they realize that if they
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:46.360]  reach too far they may lose the immunity that all of the manufacturers desire because the immunity
[3:30:46.360 --> 3:30:53.320]  under the prep act and the immunity under the 1986 act only go to vaccine manufacturers not
[3:30:53.320 --> 3:30:59.560]  to therapy manufacturers and that's why we have to be so clear this is not a vaccine therefore
[3:30:59.560 --> 3:31:08.440]  immunity from prosecution does not apply after the prep act and emergency use goes away you know
[3:31:08.440 --> 3:31:14.040]  you mentioned something interesting i'm given the uh how the supreme court of the united states
[3:31:14.040 --> 3:31:20.200]  really in my personal opinion left the american people out to dry uh after november 3rd uh how
[3:31:20.200 --> 3:31:26.920]  optimistic are you that they will stand by what's right when it comes to vaccine law non-vaccine
[3:31:26.920 --> 3:31:32.120]  medical device law in this incredible situation that's really corrupted all the way to the top
[3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:42.600]  and through all of our our agencies well i am i am sharing your concern that the immediate experience
[3:31:42.600 --> 3:31:48.120]  that we've seen in courtrooms across this country is that the justice system has rolled over to the
[3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:53.400]  pharmaceutical industry now there have been exceptions but far and away the majority of
[3:31:53.400 --> 3:32:00.840]  efforts have been in fact a full rollover what i would say however is that we have enough district
[3:32:00.840 --> 3:32:08.120]  court and appellate court justices who actually are in fact at the state level and even within
[3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:14.760]  the federal system capable of making determinations that will begin to set precedent that says that
[3:32:14.760 --> 3:32:21.240]  if somebody wants to call this a vaccine if they want to get treatment particularly when it comes
[3:32:21.240 --> 3:32:28.680]  to approval based immunity from prosecution then there's going to have to be a vaccine clinical
[3:32:28.680 --> 3:32:35.960]  trial and so far nobody has done that nobody has started that and the likelihood that that is going
[3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:41.320]  to happen is really next to zero because they already know the answer they know it doesn't work
[3:32:41.960 --> 3:32:49.800]  they know it doesn't work on star cov2 and if they had to prove that it did it would fail
[3:32:49.800 --> 3:32:55.640]  so i think we're in kind of what i would consider to be the best of a bad situation
[3:32:56.360 --> 3:33:03.400]  which is i'm confident that we are going to have more pain but i know that there is a dawn at the
[3:33:03.400 --> 3:33:11.320]  end of this dark night well i hope you're right dr martin um in the in the remaining 90 seconds
[3:33:11.320 --> 3:33:16.840]  that we have i want people to know how they can find you uh what's next for you what are you working
[3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:25.000]  on next around this i know you have many other interests and yeah i'm continuing to keep the
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:30.840]  pressure on in terms of making information available i'm going to be out in california doing
[3:33:30.840 --> 3:33:36.120]  a couple events at the end of the month i'm going to be back down in austin texas in early june

[3:33:51.640 --> 3:33:57.320]  to make sure that when they are pressured whether it's by an employer whether it's by a venue whether
[3:33:57.320 --> 3:34:04.120]  it's by a travel entity whether it's by a state or a local official we're wanting to make sure that
[3:34:04.120 --> 3:34:10.920]  people are equipped with information so david martin dot world the we the people dot buzz network

[3:38:43.560 --> 3:38:49.000]  that's why the film is evergreen and more explosive than ever get it today at info wars store dot com
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:54.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:13.880]  let's make sure we're clear on something let's stipulate that this is not a vaccine
[3:39:13.880 --> 3:39:20.760]  we're using the term vaccine to sneak this thing under public health great um exemptions
[3:39:21.480 --> 3:39:30.920]  this is not a vaccine it is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming
[3:39:30.920 --> 3:39:38.200]  a pathogen creator it is not a vaccine vaccines actually are a legally defined term and they're
[3:39:38.200 --> 3:39:44.120]  legally defined term under public health law they're legally defined term under cdc and fda
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:51.880]  standards and a vaccine specifically has to stimulate both an immunity within the person
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:57.480]  receiving it but it also has to disrupt transmission and that is not what this is they have been
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:05.720]  abundantly clear in saying that the mrna strand that is going into the cell is not to stop transmission
[3:40:05.720 --> 3:40:14.760]  it is a treat but if it was discussed as a treatment it would not get the sympathetic
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:19.960]  ear of public health authorities because then people would say well what other treatments are there
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:27.480]  the use of the term vaccine is unconscionable that's exactly what this is this is a mechanical
[3:40:27.480 --> 3:40:33.880]  device in the form of a very small packet of technology that is being inserted into the human
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:43.160]  system to activate the cell to become a pathogen manufacturing site and i refuse to stipulate
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:49.960]  in any conversations that this is in fact a vaccine issue the only reason why the term
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:58.200]  is being used is to abuse the 1905 Jacobson case that has been misrepresented since it was written
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:04.440]  so we need to be really clear on making sure we don't fall for their game because their game is
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:10.680]  if we talk about it as a vaccine then we're going to get into a vaccine conversation but this is not
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:17.000]  by their own admission a vaccine i get frustrated when i hear activists and lawyers and everybody
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:22.840]  else saying we're going to fight the vaccine if you stipulate it's a vaccine you've already lost
[3:41:22.840 --> 3:41:29.720]  the battle it's not a vaccine welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex joneshow i'm your
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:35.960]  guest host today dr jane ruby and i can't believe the time has gone by so incredibly fast that was
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:42.520]  my guest for today in the show dr david martin who is an amazing patriot uh he's a scholar
[3:41:43.080 --> 3:41:47.560]  and he's an accomplished man on so many different levels he's an international financier
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:51.960]  and i was really happy to have him on today because he set the record straight on a lot of things
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:58.920]  and he's going after dr fauci in a very big way and i i'm hoping that someday dr fauci ends up
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:42:03.560]  in a worldwide criminal court and that dr martin is one of the people testifying
[3:42:05.240 --> 3:42:11.400]  in his prosecution so with that i hope you enjoyed that i wanted to share some information at the
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:17.800]  beginning of the show i did say that i was really excited to see so much response to my interview
[3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:24.280]  with alex last week in my proton mail and so many incredible stories i wanted to share a few of them
[3:42:24.280 --> 3:42:31.240]  with you because it really reflects what people are struggling with and the types of issues that
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:37.320]  you know we're seeing when we look at the complaints of people after people getting
[3:42:37.320 --> 3:42:43.720]  the experimental injections how it's changing their lives people are afraid to be near others
[3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:49.560]  until we know more because of this phenomenon uh there's a suspicion of a phenomenon of
[3:42:49.560 --> 3:42:55.080]  what's called shedding which actually is a technical term regarding live viruses but
[3:42:55.080 --> 3:43:02.520]  the real word is transmission something is being transmitted uh biologically between the
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:10.120]  injected people and the uninjected unless we're just seeing a huge coincidence uh of a medical
[3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:17.320]  coincidence which is a little unusual um so let me share with you uh in our last few minutes
[3:43:17.320 --> 3:43:25.080]  together uh a couple a couple of comments that that you the viewers shared with me one overarching
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:30.360]  comment was from a number of medical professionals nurses you're wondering where are all these
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:35.880]  nurses and doctors why aren't they speaking up why aren't they trying to protect us there there are
[3:43:35.880 --> 3:43:41.160]  countless numbers of them i can tell you and a lot of them hit hit my mailbox one of them is a nurse
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:46.120]  out in the midwest and she said that she's really witnessing literally witnessing
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:51.240]  male practice and misinformation on it this is these are her words on a daily basis and she
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:56.040]  said she's been asked to give these injections she refuses she's on the verge of losing her job
[3:43:56.040 --> 3:44:02.200]  in her healthcare system but she said if i can save one patient uh i i became a nurse to save
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:08.120]  people not to hurt them i thought that was uh you know a nurse with a conscience and i myself am a
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:15.400]  licensed nurse practitioner that's my medical background and i would be just horrified to be
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:20.840]  asked to participate in any of this and i think when the truth comes out not only will dr fouchy
[3:44:20.840 --> 3:44:26.920]  be held accountable but a lot of these people are giving these injections um telling reassuring
[3:44:26.920 --> 3:44:31.320]  people based on no science at all that it's perfectly safe don't worry about it we just
[3:44:31.320 --> 3:44:35.800]  want you to hang around for about 10 minutes to make sure you don't have any reactions uh just
[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:43.160]  just unbelievably unprecedented uh lots of people asking what the mechanism is of the transmission
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:51.640]  if you will and a bigger question that's coming out is around transfusions you could envision a
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:59.320]  scenario where you are maybe injured in a car accident you are unconscious temporarily you
[3:44:59.320 --> 3:45:05.640]  can't speak for yourself but you're either given the experimental injection called a vaccine because
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:11.960]  that's the hospital's policy or you could be transfused with blood of someone who has been
[3:45:11.960 --> 3:45:17.320]  injected and so as we said we do know that that material does get into every cell in the body
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:22.920]  because of the nanolipid particle but we don't know if it's transferred in a blood transfusion
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:27.800]  although i did get a lot of questions to that effect so we don't know yet but it's it's an
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:33.320]  incredibly important question because it would change a lot of different procedures
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:40.520]  and you might want to change your medical uh proxy and will to to direct how you want things done
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:47.160]  if you're incapacitated in you know in the surrounding of forced vaccines and transfusions
[3:45:47.160 --> 3:45:51.240]  that you might need to save your life but it could end up ultimately making you very sick
[3:45:51.240 --> 3:45:57.720]  and and costing you your life the other big question that came up was around the duration
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:06.360]  of this shedding phenomenon one person wrote to me and said that he it had been maybe 30 days since
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:13.560]  his relative that lived in a different home had gotten the experimental injection and he
[3:46:13.560 --> 3:46:18.840]  wondered if it was safe after over time over a period of time of course we don't really know
[3:46:18.840 --> 3:46:23.800]  really know the answer to that yet and it's it's one of the big scientific questions that somebody
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:30.520]  has to start a study and look at we we need to run trials legitimate trials not the joke that's
[3:46:30.520 --> 3:46:36.760]  being run now there's no control what we call a control arm of the study in the Pfizer Moderna
[3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:42.120]  AstraZeneca or J&J studies right now that are ongoing as we've told you and as Alex has told
[3:46:42.120 --> 3:46:50.120]  you and his other guests many times till 2023 so we need a real trial where we have people getting
[3:46:50.120 --> 3:46:56.840]  the injections or not getting the injections looking at the transmission potential are the
[3:46:56.840 --> 3:47:02.920]  people who have not been injected are they showing markers in their blood or their bodily fluids
[3:47:02.920 --> 3:47:08.360]  that would indicate that they are making spike proteins without getting having gotten the shot
[3:47:08.360 --> 3:47:12.680]  that those are really important questions that I want to applaud the audience members that wrote
[3:47:12.680 --> 3:47:18.120]  to me and asked about those things and I do think the transfusion transfer is a serious question
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:25.320]  many people wanted to know if the code if you've had the natural COVID infection like I did last
[3:47:25.320 --> 3:47:32.440]  March of 2020 three weeks of a brutal flu and survived it but the questions are coming out
[3:47:32.440 --> 3:47:39.160]  am I protected now as anyone who's had the natural disease protected from getting the transmission
[3:47:39.160 --> 3:47:43.960]  not getting it again because you should have antibodies that will recognize and annihilate
[3:47:44.680 --> 3:47:51.080]  that virus if it is seen again in your system but asking am I protected from this shedding
[3:47:51.080 --> 3:47:57.240]  phenomenon again really early too early to know but these are critical questions and you can
[3:47:57.240 --> 3:48:04.200]  bet that I will be very vigilant and continue to watch for them and report on them people are
[3:48:04.200 --> 3:48:08.680]  asking I don't want to put paranoia in people's minds about flying in aircraft we have enough
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:14.280]  problems with the Nazi flight attendants and the airlines with their you know ridiculous rules
[3:48:14.280 --> 3:48:19.640]  keeping us six feet apart but then two inches apart when we sit down in the airplane but people
[3:48:19.640 --> 3:48:25.560]  are asking if they might be affected by this transmission phenomenon if they're in close
[3:48:25.560 --> 3:48:29.880]  if they're in close proximity in public transportation again something that we will
[3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:37.800]  be looking at and I'll be reporting back on lastly and sadly I had a gentleman write to me
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:43.800]  and say that since his the in-laws have both gotten the shot and they live with them his wife
[3:48:43.800 --> 3:48:49.160]  in the last four months has had two miscarriages and she had not had the injection so I pray for
[3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:55.800]  them and I hope that we can just put a halt you know my hashtag is just wait there you have nothing
[3:48:55.800 --> 3:49:01.720]  to lose by just waiting and waiting this thing out anyway I hope we've given you some great
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:09.320]  information today I've really enjoyed being a guest host on Alex's fourth hour you know he's
[3:49:09.320 --> 3:49:15.160]  got a great audience with a lot of amazing people we've covered some ground I'll be happy to come
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:21.960]  back in the future just let Alex know and thanks again for all you do as the audience support
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:29.800]  Alex and and all of info wars because we don't have many people and platforms left like him
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:35.720]  and like info wars and my hat goes off to him and his crew their first class thanks for everything
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:42.440]  and have a great day this was dr. jane ruby the equation is very simple the mega banks control
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:49.480]  the media they control big pharma they control academia they control the military industrial
[3:49:49.480 --> 3:49:55.640]  complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:50:03.400]  have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the western christian idea
[3:50:03.400 --> 3:50:08.280]  of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that
[3:50:08.280 --> 3:50:14.760]  actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:22.360]  turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free
[3:50:22.360 --> 3:50:27.400]  market that threatens their monopolies of control that's why they target info wars because we
[3:50:27.400 --> 3:50:32.680]  understand the keys to defeating them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:39.480]  promote info wars and ban that video so we double your efforts we're all in this together all of
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:45.320]  our supplements all of our products are the highest grade that we are able to get that is something
[3:50:45.320 --> 3:50:51.160]  i guarantee to you and your family and i respect you and i appreciate your support you are funding
[3:50:51.160 --> 3:50:57.400]  an organization that tirelessly fearlessly takes on the globalist i really appreciate you keeping
[3:50:57.400 --> 3:51:01.960]  me in the fight i'm willing to go to prison i'm willing to die to fight these globalists to fight
[3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:07.560]  these metaphors fight these sickness but i can't stay in the attack in the fight against these
[3:51:07.560 --> 3:51:12.280]  monsters without your support so again i want to thank you and your family i want to thank
[3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:17.640]  everybody in your orbit that is supporting you so you can support me and this operation because
[3:51:17.640 --> 3:51:23.560]  we are all in this together i want to thank you for your parents having you i'm serious i appreciate
[3:51:23.560 --> 3:51:28.680]  you it's it's that simple that's when you call in to thank me i get a little bit irritated sometimes
[3:51:28.680 --> 3:51:34.120]  because you are the reason we're still on air you are the wrath on which i'm out in this
[3:51:34.840 --> 3:51:40.120]  rough sea literally surviving and you could say vice versa i'm the wrath that you're
[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:57.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
