[01:00.080 --> 01:07.680]  absolutely jam-packed radio broadcast lined up for you today Paul Joseph
[01:07.680 --> 01:14.480]  Watson is joining us with a news story that is just so incredible and it's even
[01:14.480 --> 01:23.040]  more incredible because the New York Times the BBC they all admit
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.860]  openly that it's true but basically just whitewash it and say that it's no big
[01:30.860 --> 01:36.320]  deal and that of course is World Bank funded trips going in and slaughtering
[01:36.320 --> 01:42.740]  people and burning down their houses in the name of the environment and this is
[01:42.740 --> 01:53.640]  the new green army system that is being promoted worldwide just a month ago the
[01:53.640 --> 01:56.360]  United Nations came out and said we're gonna have a new green army that
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.960]  responds to governments that pollute you'll be invaded of course the
[02:02.960 --> 02:06.080]  globalists themselves when nuclear reactors blow up they'll just tell your
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.280]  radiations good for you or when they genetically modify the crops that
[02:10.280 --> 02:14.120]  openly sterilize all the mammals species that are fed it that won't be a
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.120]  problem it's just if they want your resources they're going to say you're
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.160]  an environmental criminal and they're also going to invade areas they're
[02:21.160 --> 02:29.360]  having crises because of climate change amazing information that is all coming
[02:29.360 --> 02:36.440]  up today and we'll be going over that amazing article that is at info wars

[07:00.080 --> 07:03.440]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[07:03.440 --> 07:07.400]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.680]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.680 --> 07:15.920]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.280]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.280 --> 07:24.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.920]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.920 --> 07:33.040]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.040 --> 07:37.040]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.040 --> 07:40.840]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.840 --> 07:43.560]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.560 --> 07:47.040]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[07:47.040 --> 07:52.640]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[07:52.640 --> 08:01.120]  doesn't own the sun should go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[08:01.120 --> 08:06.040]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the
[08:06.040 --> 08:13.360]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network thank you
[08:13.360 --> 08:17.360]  for joining us an extremely important transmission lined up for you on this
[08:17.360 --> 08:24.520]  live Friday edition it is the 23rd day of September 2011 of course I'll be back
[08:24.520 --> 08:30.640]  tonight 7 p.m. central with a in-depth analysis of what's happening with the
[08:30.640 --> 08:36.800]  economy and so much more tonight with M. Full Wars nightly news 7 p.m. central 8
[08:36.800 --> 08:43.160]  p.m. Eastern my head is spinning right now with the news obviously the
[08:43.160 --> 08:48.000]  stock market is continuing the plunge that it began yesterday on word of this
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.800]  new manipulation of the bond market which in my view is a form of quantitative
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.680]  easing and more signals that official quantitative easing or monetization of
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.920]  debt an issuance of more currency is going to commence Greek default talk
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.760]  gathers pace G20 is saying they need another bailout to the central bankers
[09:08.760 --> 09:12.720]  and need Europe to hand over what sovereignty it has left to the private
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.960]  banking cartel Michael Moore is threatening the rich saying let's
[09:16.960 --> 09:21.840]  deal with it non violently now where it's going to get violent what the man
[09:21.840 --> 09:25.920]  worth hundreds of millions is actually doing is saying let's get rid of the
[09:25.920 --> 09:29.760]  middle class and transfer all the money offshore or we're going to use our
[09:29.760 --> 09:34.120]  communist forces who are idiots to rob what's left of the middle class that's
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.960]  basically what's happening pressure from above and below the ultra rich use the
[09:38.960 --> 09:43.600]  welfare Queens as their army to threaten to burn down cities if they don't
[09:43.600 --> 09:47.040]  destroy what's left of the middle class and Michael Moore knows full well
[09:47.040 --> 09:51.240]  exactly what he's doing that's why the establishment puts him out there and
[09:51.240 --> 09:57.040]  finances him also Ahmed Denizide obviously spoke at the UN yesterday and
[09:57.040 --> 10:01.720]  there was a big US Israel walkout he brought up the World Trade Center's
[10:01.720 --> 10:05.480]  controlled emulation as an engineer as thousands of other engineers have said
[10:05.480 --> 10:09.960]  it's clearly controlled emulation so now the spin is you're you know a Iranian
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.120]  Revolutionary Guard supporter if you understand the laws of physics you know
[10:14.120 --> 10:17.800]  you watch building seven fall and its own footprint you see the police say get
[10:17.800 --> 10:20.800]  back they're gonna blow it up the firefighters say there were bombs in
[10:20.800 --> 10:24.000]  there the deputy head of emergency management says there's bombs you're
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.240]  supposed to ignore all that and just say well Ahmed Denizide says it looks like
[10:28.240 --> 10:34.640]  it's a controlled emulation so it must not be so the media is seizing seizing
[10:34.640 --> 10:42.240]  upon that there's just so much we're going to be covering today Rabbi David
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.360]  Bendori the new head of Jews the preservation of firearms ownership a
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.720]  great second amendment group and was sad at the passing in the last year of
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.480]  Aaron Zelman the director of it he's gonna be popping in with a his take on
[10:54.480 --> 11:00.000]  fast and furious and some updates on that briefly in the next hour then of
[11:00.000 --> 11:06.160]  course Bob Chapman is joining us I went ahead and sent reporters yesterday to
[11:06.160 --> 11:11.400]  this giant martial law drill and that's where it is last year I sent Rob
[11:11.400 --> 11:17.840]  Dube and Jason Douglas our reporters up to Illinois where they practice putting
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.480]  citizens in the sports stadium and taking over shopping malls and the
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.840]  military was involved same things happening here and I decided to do this
[11:26.840 --> 11:30.800]  yesterday at about 2 o'clock the guys were on a plane at 6 they already shot
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.280]  more than 10 reports last night that are all up at info wars dot com already
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.000]  interviews the homeland security people you name it helicopters all of its up
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.720]  there they're in a school drill right now but all of this is about creating the
[11:45.720 --> 11:50.800]  perception of fear about creating the perception that terrorism is real this
[11:50.800 --> 11:55.920]  new rollout branding away from Al Qaeda to domestic mainly tea party anti-global
[11:55.920 --> 11:59.920]  scripts that was going on behind the scenes for years now it's a public roll
[11:59.920 --> 12:03.880]  out with the white Al Qaeda as the new branding if you don't like globalism
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.800]  well a you must be white because nobody else could be anti-globalist or pro
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.000]  liberty so it already divides people and makes a pro-constitution movement
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.440]  white as MSNBC talking points say and now homeland security and then only are
[12:17.440 --> 12:23.320]  you white which of course is bad nowadays but you're also a terrorist so all of
[12:23.320 --> 12:30.200]  that is going on continuing they were reporting 81 agencies now they're
[12:30.200 --> 12:32.680]  reporting we have a sheriff's department document the curtain in most written
[12:32.680 --> 12:36.360]  about it's now more than a hundred and at the end of the day it's a fair
[12:36.360 --> 12:40.480]  mongering federalization takeover exercise we'll be talking to Aaron
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.840]  Dykes and Darren McBrain coming up we'll just get them on both other cell
[12:45.840 --> 12:49.360]  phones and just to see which one is the best from on the ground there I've talked
[12:49.360 --> 12:53.320]  to Aaron up before I went live it's not pretty good where he was at continuing
[12:53.320 --> 12:57.600]  here Perry caught in blatant lie over support for bailouts that's big news
[12:57.600 --> 13:01.680]  also Perry came out in the debate last night and said look I am for state and
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.520]  tuition for illegal aliens ladies and gentlemen citizens from California or
[13:06.520 --> 13:12.080]  Oklahoma if they moved to Texas don't get in state tuition why did Perry
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.480]  support it and got an award from Vicente Fox for it and he said you know you
[13:16.480 --> 13:21.000]  got to have a heart really if I go to Mexico illegally they will put me in
[13:21.000 --> 13:26.800]  hard labor for six to twelve months in literally in dirt floor facilities and
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.720]  if my family doesn't send money I will be allowed to starve to death
[13:30.720 --> 13:35.280]  Mexico admits this in fact you can type in Mexico admits they have harsh
[13:35.280 --> 13:41.640]  immigration laws some of the harshest North Korea maybe is is is is worse
[13:41.640 --> 13:48.720]  literally literally so can I go down to Mexico and get some in-state tuition
[13:48.720 --> 13:54.840]  come on give it to me oh no no no no no no no see see there's this there's this
[13:54.840 --> 14:00.560]  American guilt there's this guilt and don't worry we're bankrupting we're
[14:00.560 --> 14:04.840]  falling apart we're a joke and we've got 800 plus sanctuary cities where the
[14:04.840 --> 14:08.360]  illegals are allowed to drink and drive whatever they want it's on record so
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.520]  that's all coming up and Perry's been caught again lying and saying he didn't
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.400]  support the bailouts Mitt Romney supported them Bill O'Reilly supported
[14:16.400 --> 14:22.520]  them who else supported them of the neocondom
[14:22.520 --> 14:27.760]  Lynn Beck supported them they all supported them all of them except Michael
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.400]  Savage every single stinking one of them at the key point supported it Michael
[14:34.400 --> 14:37.440]  Savage certainly in perfect but he will say the government's get ready to state
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.320]  care attacks and that we want shouldn't be for the bailout so I give credit where
[14:42.320 --> 14:47.080]  credits do all the rest of them supported the bailouts and now three and a
[14:47.080 --> 14:50.600]  half years later they hope you don't remember and notice but Steve Watson's
[14:50.600 --> 14:55.360]  got the video clips and the quotes oh I'm sorry Perry now all of this pales
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.440]  and significance to the next piece of news by Paul Joseph Watson at info wars
[15:00.440 --> 15:08.600]  calm and prison planet calm this is some of the most important news that I have
[15:08.600 --> 15:14.600]  covered in a long time now I remember a couple months ago the London Guardian and
[15:14.600 --> 15:19.880]  others reported that the UN had announced a new Green Army that will
[15:19.880 --> 15:25.440]  invade countries that quota engage in environmental crimes now if you're a
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.160]  globalist run system which is most countries you can have reactors blow up
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.760]  they'll just say it's nutritional splice all the different plants together that
[15:33.760 --> 15:38.800]  sterilizes all the mammals it's tested on GMO it's great all best phenol in all
[15:38.800 --> 15:43.560]  the major products in the soup cans you name it that's all part of the plan
[15:43.560 --> 15:50.080]  they're saying they will invade your country the UN just got done invading
[15:50.080 --> 15:53.920]  Ivory Coast a few months ago and admittedly the rebels killed tens of
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.440]  thousands and and and and took over and it's a UN takeover for the diamonds in
[15:59.440 --> 16:06.960]  that case now the New York Times and others admit this is going on this
[16:06.960 --> 16:10.320]  article when you hear this this is admitted but they just basically white
[16:10.320 --> 16:14.640]  wash it kind of like this LA Times article 30,000 mostly black Libyans
[16:14.640 --> 16:20.200]  flee a single town there are giant mass graves and in some cases giant dead
[16:20.200 --> 16:25.920]  piles of black people black Libyans the the al-Qaeda forces that natives put in
[16:25.920 --> 16:31.840]  are publicly engaged in a massacre that will soon reach Rwandan proportions we
[16:31.840 --> 16:36.280]  told you about this six months ago it had begun now it's just palmel kill any
[16:36.280 --> 16:39.920]  black you come across and again the liberals who have a heart attack if
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.880]  somebody doesn't handle with their bank account they'll say give us your bank
[16:42.880 --> 16:45.880]  account give us government health care give the foreign banks all your money
[16:45.880 --> 16:50.000]  or your racist and whites just slipped their wrist and go I'm guilty take
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.800]  everything I've got give it to Al Gore meanwhile the UN all over the world is
[16:54.800 --> 16:59.640]  slaughtering quote minorities which are the majority globally and and it's part
[16:59.640 --> 17:05.160]  of a racist eugenics program and LA Times is just mass murder total death
[17:05.160 --> 17:09.160]  New York Times admits it but don't worry David Cameron has gone to the
[17:09.160 --> 17:13.840]  United Nations David we're going to Paul here in a moment into the next
[17:13.840 --> 17:17.400]  segment he's gone to the United Nations and said yes let's invade more
[17:17.400 --> 17:21.760]  countries under humanitarian auspices so they fund rebels they rebel the
[17:21.760 --> 17:25.560]  government fights back the population fights back NATO bombs the country for
[17:25.560 --> 17:29.920]  five six months and invades and then slaughters any minority group and then
[17:29.920 --> 17:33.240]  calls it loving and liberal because a peace prize presidents running and after
[17:33.240 --> 17:37.320]  all he's part black so it must be good again this is all political correctness
[17:37.320 --> 17:41.880]  like a sick mental illness now now now here's the latest news they invade your
[17:41.880 --> 17:45.680]  country over environmental reasons they invade your country over humanitarian
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.560]  reasons having rebels try to overthrow it here's Paul Watson's headline and it's
[17:50.560 --> 17:56.280]  all true armed troops burned down homes killed children to evict Ugandans in
[17:56.280 --> 18:00.440]  name of global warming and the mainstream news actually says well it's
[18:00.440 --> 18:06.680]  for the earth line up the family shoot them burn them kill everybody it's a
[18:06.680 --> 18:11.400]  it's a program to come in and displace the people to quote plant trees as part
[18:11.400 --> 18:15.480]  of their carbon allotment and Paul Watson joins us we're going to break in a
[18:15.480 --> 18:19.920]  moment Paul but what's even more incredible than the UN backed forces
[18:19.920 --> 18:24.200]  murdering people Paul is that the media is like well it's okay this is loving
[18:24.200 --> 18:29.600]  this is a sacrament of death Paul well I mean just look at the headline that the
[18:29.600 --> 18:35.040]  New York Times puts on top of this astounding story in scramble for land
[18:35.040 --> 18:41.360]  group says company pushed Ugandans out just gently pushed them out then you
[18:41.360 --> 18:46.960]  actually read what the villages reported was done burning down homes killing
[18:46.960 --> 18:51.120]  children beating people up threatening to shoot them in the head if they resist
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.160]  you know just gently pushing them out and of course this is all being run
[18:55.160 --> 19:00.880]  under the order of the World Bank and other banks like HSBC transnational
[19:00.880 --> 19:07.560]  corporations it's called the new forests company and it's basically working with
[19:07.560 --> 19:14.040]  the brutal Ugandan government they've evicted more than 20,000 Africans and
[19:14.040 --> 19:20.000]  also people in South America from their land basically little warning no
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.960]  compensation armed troops turn up set everybody everybody's houses on fire
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.560]  beating kill anyone who resists there's a report of children being killed in this
[19:29.560 --> 19:34.000]  New York Times article but that's a gentle push that's a nudge Paul just to
[19:34.000 --> 19:38.320]  just a gentle push and we wonder why we have 30 million legal aliens here this
[19:38.320 --> 19:42.440]  was done in the 80s and 90s all over southern and central Mexico on record
[19:42.440 --> 19:46.560]  they came and took land that people been on for thousands of years under a UN
[19:46.560 --> 19:50.720]  program they even had rebellions in Yucatan over it we'll be right back to
[19:50.720 --> 19:55.240]  break this down this is the loving liberal genocide that you love so much

[23:56.120 --> 24:00.240]  332 6784
[24:00.240 --> 24:11.840]  think about how incredible this is how off the charts Cameron and the UN the
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.640]  Prime Minister of England and the UN are openly in the news yesterday saying
[24:16.640 --> 24:21.240]  we're gonna have more humanitarian interventions like Libya Ivory Coast and
[24:21.240 --> 24:24.920]  others they're talking about Syria and it's on record the West is funding
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.880]  rebels in all these countries to try to overthrow them they're going into Libya
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.080]  and now it's been admitted for weeks what we told you six months ago they are
[24:34.080 --> 24:39.000]  murdering blacks on site who live in North Africa who were part of the
[24:39.000 --> 24:44.120]  country they are killing them that's all report where they shot toddlers and
[24:44.120 --> 24:48.680]  killed them yesterday in the Associated Press because their names last names were
[24:48.680 --> 24:58.000]  Qaddafi that's basically like Jones or Smith in Libya very common name and they
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.240]  just killed them I mean this is what they got them at the airport caught them
[25:02.240 --> 25:06.880]  at the airport they just lined them up and shot them that was in the news
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.720]  yesterday and it's like oh this is so humanitarian and now I'm reading the
[25:10.720 --> 25:16.840]  New York Times and others and they're like well yeah this World Bank run
[25:16.840 --> 25:20.800]  company and they just say when they come into an area oh we're doing this to plant
[25:20.800 --> 25:25.360]  trees it's for a forest and basically we've seen this over and over again with
[25:25.360 --> 25:30.360]  the UN Agenda 21 UN biosphere zones they go and enforce the indigenous
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.680]  populations out this is incredible Paul Watson please continue with your
[25:35.680 --> 25:38.040]  report
[25:39.080 --> 25:42.440]  hold on we're gonna get you need to start over I'm sorry you weren't fated up go
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.600]  ahead yeah this is the new forest company which which is a British company
[25:47.600 --> 25:54.040]  its primary investor is the World Bank it's run by the current HSBC managing
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.440]  director and also on its board of directors are several investment bankers
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.320]  including one who worked for Goldman Sachs basically they make money out of
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.200]  seizing the land of poor villages in Africa primarily planting trees and
[26:09.200 --> 26:13.840]  then selling the carbon offsets to trans transnational corporations who can
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.640]  then quote pollute and of course the cost is merely passed on to us the
[26:17.640 --> 26:21.880]  consumer and then afterwards they just chop down the trees and sell them for
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.000]  timber anyway so you've got this group which is basically run by the World
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.720]  Bank is a World Bank from working in alliance with the Ugandan government
[26:30.720 --> 26:35.920]  and the army they show up at villages threaten people to get out of their
[26:35.920 --> 26:41.880]  homes if they don't they kill them they set the homes on fire and then they for
[26:41.880 --> 26:45.280]  example in this one village which is mentioned in the New York Times article
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.720]  the school where the kids were taught which of course is very important in
[26:49.720 --> 26:54.720]  Africa where it's education so lacking the school is now the headquarters for
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.160]  this British sustainability company so they ransack entire villages and towns
[27:00.160 --> 27:05.640]  farmers have the whole plantations destroyed there's one case in a guardian
[27:05.640 --> 27:09.200]  article which is about the same issue where the guy talks about you know he
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.000]  had he was growing bananas he was growing sugar canes he was feeding his
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.360]  children now he's you know the poorest guy there and the malaria malnutrition
[27:20.360 --> 27:25.240]  all exploding as a result of this and it's again it's neocolonialism under the
[27:25.240 --> 27:29.440]  guise of protecting against global warming this is killing the African
[27:29.440 --> 27:34.440]  dream of development and a reasonable standard of living through global
[27:34.440 --> 27:40.360]  warming hysteria which is all run by transnational banks and corporations who
[27:40.360 --> 27:45.880]  invoke this climate change con to raise villages and steal land so they can take
[27:45.880 --> 27:53.280]  a slice of this multi-billion-dollar carbon trading Ponzi scheme and and Paul
[27:53.280 --> 27:58.560]  as the 1948 British Royal Commission admitted it was adopted by the US
[27:58.560 --> 28:04.080]  government as policy on record we cover an in-game they said if we let the third
[28:04.080 --> 28:08.160]  world industrialized will stop having as many kids but we're going to block them
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.000]  from industrializing they're going to have a bunch of kids but then we'll
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.840]  just mitigate with birth control and land use and use food as a weapon as
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.800]  Kissinger repeated in 73 and State Department memorandum 200 and so this
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.440]  is so cold-blooded just like the carbon taxes in Copenhagen we learned we're
[28:27.440 --> 28:31.320]  right at double what they would be on the third world what they would be on the
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.920]  West this is a death sentence by a bunch of eugenicists but as long as they say
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.800]  they're liberal it's okay and trendies all over Austin have carbon offsets
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.920]  stickers on their cars and paid money to these very groups so they can run around
[28:44.920 --> 28:48.560]  mass murdering black people they love it too I mean you tell a liberal they're
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.800]  like good murder them all there's too many I'm liberal man come sorry go
[28:51.800 --> 28:57.200]  ahead no no I mean progressives who hyperventilate about you know global
[28:57.200 --> 29:01.120]  warming impacting poor people the most and how we need to reduce our living
[29:01.120 --> 29:06.040]  standards when global warming alarmism itself is not just reducing the living
[29:06.040 --> 29:10.360]  standards of the poor it's starving them to death I mean look at biofuels
[29:10.360 --> 29:16.200]  you've got countries like Swaziland and Haiti where they're living on mud pies
[29:16.200 --> 29:21.000]  you know food prices double because all these transnational corporations stay
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.680]  there stay there we're going to air and we're gonna come online now but I want
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.720]  you to finish when we come back this is part of a larger program and I want to
[29:28.720 --> 29:33.640]  tie it in as you were just doing with the Copenhagen Treaty with the biofuels
[29:33.640 --> 29:38.080]  admittedly killing millions more every year the starvation and you bring this
[29:38.080 --> 29:42.280]  up to a liberal trendy they'll just go I'm not a liberal trending okay I mean
[29:42.280 --> 29:47.560]  they're really Nazis and it they love it it's so much fun for them we'll be
[29:47.560 --> 29:59.680]  right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:11.640 --> 33:17.880]  okay we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining
[33:17.880 --> 33:22.560]  us Paul Watson is here with us when you hear me start hyperventilating and
[33:22.560 --> 33:28.680]  getting angry and calling the globalist scum I'm just being real I am here
[33:28.680 --> 33:34.880]  basically attempting to get you to wake up and get out of your trance I want
[33:34.880 --> 33:40.040]  to explain something the eugenicists said in the 50s Hitler embarrassed us
[33:40.040 --> 33:44.120]  we're going to now say we're a green movement and we're going to cut off the
[33:44.120 --> 33:49.800]  resources to the third world we do not want them to develop so we're going to
[33:49.800 --> 33:54.000]  let them overpopulate even from their perspective you can debate whether it's
[33:54.000 --> 34:00.160]  overpopulated or not it's a cold-blooded militarized attack and now all over the
[34:00.160 --> 34:04.440]  world I've been there Mexico you name it they come in and force the people off
[34:04.440 --> 34:10.360]  their ancestral land who are living sustainably in nature happily they
[34:10.360 --> 34:14.640]  heard them into the cities they give them the vaccines Mexico cities got 35
[34:14.640 --> 34:19.640]  million people something like 20% of the children are born with a syndrome
[34:19.640 --> 34:22.960]  or their brain is underdeveloped and they don't they they don't ever even talk
[34:22.960 --> 34:28.000]  or move they're just vegetables and the parents just take care of these of these
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.840]  coma creatures I mean you can look that up that's even in PBS documentaries total
[34:32.840 --> 34:36.200]  toxic waste it's the same thing all over the place and then they build the
[34:36.200 --> 34:40.400]  cheap widgets that we buy that break before you even get out of the box most
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.200]  things have actually by on the road at Walmart if I have to breaks within five
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.440]  minutes I mean I'm shocked when I buy something at a target or a Walmart that
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.320]  actually works more than once I bought a bottle opener the other day when I was
[34:53.320 --> 34:56.800]  out of town made and shine it's all they had at the gas station and it didn't
[34:56.800 --> 35:02.000]  work it wouldn't open bottles it just it wasn't even the right size it's just
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.800]  it's complete idiocy with suicide nets around the buildings where the iPads are
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.280]  made now they're forcing them all off into the big cities where they then have
[35:11.280 --> 35:15.840]  to go on UN UNICEF assistance then you give money to help the starving black
[35:15.840 --> 35:20.880]  kids and then that's vaccines and HIV they've caught the UN adding to it and
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.000]  sterilants and all this garbage all this garbage while they block
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.880]  industrialization it is an incredible death sentence and this article needs to
[35:31.880 --> 35:36.520]  be gotten out to everyone to everyone I'm gonna be reporting on it more tonight
[35:36.520 --> 35:43.600]  on info wars nightly news at 7 o'clock we're also gonna get in tonight on the
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.200]  show to all these women shaving their heads for cancer awareness and men doing
[35:48.200 --> 35:55.000]  it and all the jogs and runs and events but never talking about why is cancer
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.960]  tripled in most types I keep saying double the last ten years I'm sorry I
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.880]  went and looked at the numbers again and on most types it's tripled since 1980
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.800]  breast cancer right at tripled other types some of quadrupled some are up seven
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.000]  fold tenfold lung cancer and women sevenfold even though smoking's way down
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.680]  by the way I see disinformation campaigns I was on Russia today a few days
[36:17.680 --> 36:21.560]  ago and I saw a commenter it's always the same dummy channels saying Alex
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.600]  Jones is a liar I checked his facts Switzerland is not the wealthiest country
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.760]  per capita and then I saw the same dummy accounts responding and when yes I
[36:29.760 --> 36:34.200]  checked it he's a liar I was debating you know globalism and
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.920]  neutrality and how neutrality is always a good policy George Washington said with
[36:38.920 --> 36:43.080]  the host and I thought well I've known that for years but let me check and make
[36:43.080 --> 36:46.840]  sure I'm wrong I thought Luxembourg isn't really technically a country it's a
[36:46.840 --> 36:51.280]  parking spot for the elite but per capita it's not as wealthy as Switzerland
[36:51.280 --> 36:57.920]  I said I know Norway's close boom pulled it up World Factbook Switzerland for more
[36:57.920 --> 37:03.520]  than 20 years running the wealthiest per capita country over 217,000 adjusted
[37:03.520 --> 37:09.840]  dollars even more in Swiss francs a year so so I see this continued disinfo
[37:09.840 --> 37:14.480]  campaign not by people that don't like me but it's a they admit they have these
[37:14.480 --> 37:18.240]  programs through Cass Sunstein the White House PR firms but dummy accounts with
[37:18.240 --> 37:24.080]  no information just saying everything I'm saying is a lie and it's a hoax it's a
[37:24.080 --> 37:29.680]  hoax so just just just look for that and see that and know that web-wide no one
[37:29.680 --> 37:32.920]  is attacked like yours truly and ought to be glad at least they're just doing
[37:32.920 --> 37:37.600]  that not killing me okay they're trying to assassinate my character and that's
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.400]  fine because I don't care about myself there's no future if we don't beat these
[37:42.400 --> 37:47.360]  people okay but when I tell you the UN's been caught worldwide hundreds of
[37:47.360 --> 37:51.200]  times adding steroids to vaccines I had Dr. Sherry 10 penny we're going to
[37:51.200 --> 37:56.240]  Erin in a moment after Paul finishes I had Dr. Sherry 10 penny on yesterday I'd
[37:56.240 --> 37:59.200]  interview her 10 years ago and she wouldn't say it's on purpose they're
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.400]  trying to kill us world government now she's read all the documents the
[38:02.400 --> 38:06.920]  Rockefeller documents now she sees 13 different manufacturers Merck making
[38:06.920 --> 38:12.720]  their vaccine 13 labs making it all of them on purpose clearly had the adjuvant
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.400]  bound to the full virus not an attenuated and it's really meant to
[38:17.400 --> 38:21.680]  implant the virus inside the DNA of the body and that's what all the medical
[38:21.680 --> 38:25.040]  scientists who've looked at her saying and I said to her is this not staged and
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.360]  she said no it's clearly staged I mean boom right there people are really
[38:29.360 --> 38:35.680]  facing the horror only facing it only facing it is going to defeat these
[38:35.680 --> 38:41.960]  people I mean even two years ago she wasn't going that far only facing it is
[38:41.960 --> 38:48.520]  going to defeat them okay I'm sorry I'm just I'm just so upset arm troops burn
[38:48.520 --> 38:51.800]  down homes kill children to evict Ugandan's the name of global warming
[38:51.800 --> 38:57.800]  and as Watson pointed out this World Bank profit company that Al Gore and all
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.920]  of them are involved in this company and other similar ones and I literally see
[39:01.920 --> 39:05.880]  trendies all over Austin with my car is offset like I'm trendy I'm driving a
[39:05.880 --> 39:10.360]  car but it's offset I'm paying thousands of these companies and I've tried to
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.280]  talk to on the street I'll say listen do you understand this is about population
[39:13.280 --> 39:16.360]  reduction and they'll just say I don't want to talk to you I'll say come on
[39:16.360 --> 39:21.120]  just just just let me talk to my iPhone real quick let me just explain okay just
[39:21.120 --> 39:27.080]  look up the 1948-49 British Population Commission please please and they're
[39:27.080 --> 39:31.760]  just like no no go listen to Rush Limbaugh and I'm like I'm not with Rush
[39:31.760 --> 39:37.200]  Limbaugh they just will not listen they do and it's like look they're LA Times
[39:37.200 --> 39:41.120]  30,000 blacks fleeing one town tens of thousands of dead blacks everywhere
[39:41.120 --> 39:44.360]  there they're hacking up men women and children it's genocide it's wrong and
[39:44.360 --> 39:51.040]  they just go I don't care I am liberal I am trendy Obama launched it the UN
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.520]  wants it give it to me you people are sick disgusting filth alright I'm sorry
[39:57.520 --> 40:01.800]  I've just you're a bunch of scum and the high-up ones know what they're doing
[40:01.800 --> 40:07.480]  with the mid-level low-level ones are like modern 21st century neo-nazis and
[40:07.480 --> 40:10.800]  are so brainwashed they don't even know it with the hippie hair and the
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.880]  patchouli and the and the sandals and they're just a mechanized army that's
[40:14.880 --> 40:21.880]  almost unstoppable and they will not listen they do not care and I don't
[40:21.880 --> 40:27.000]  care if you got tattoos sandals cowboy hats I'm not into how you look I'm just
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.880]  saying it's Paul I know I'm ranting here a finisher points about this full
[40:31.880 --> 40:36.960]  spectrum analysis how it's it's a total shutoff of world resources which will
[40:36.960 --> 40:40.360]  make us all deathly poor dependent on government so they can force their way
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.280]  on us but for the third world it is a total death sentence they're really
[40:44.280 --> 40:50.160]  moving its official US and UN policy and we've got to stop this mass murder I
[40:50.160 --> 40:54.600]  know it's trendy and a sacrament for the left to kill brown people while you
[40:54.600 --> 40:58.120]  tell us to give up all of our rights and guns and have government health care to
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.960]  you to euthanize us or we don't like brown people I understand your guilt
[41:01.960 --> 41:07.280]  trip garbage and I'm done with it go ahead Paul well I mean you know it was
[41:07.280 --> 41:10.640]  Obama's very first decision when he got into the White House to increase
[41:10.640 --> 41:15.800]  funding to provide abortions for black children in the third world so yeah I
[41:15.800 --> 41:19.680]  mean all of these liberals and trendies go about their business saying it's to
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.280]  protect the poor to protect black people and their support in the very people
[41:24.280 --> 41:27.840]  who are killing black people on mass like the world bang you know working with
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.680]  the Obama administration just last year to prevent developing countries from
[41:32.680 --> 41:36.560]  building coal-fired plants they don't want them to lift themselves out of
[41:36.560 --> 41:43.040]  poverty we're talking about 561 million acres of land an area the size of
[41:43.040 --> 41:48.680]  northwest Europe since 2001 that have been swallowed up by these transnational
[41:48.680 --> 41:53.160]  corporations in the name of preventing global warming kicking people off their
[41:53.160 --> 41:59.760]  land destroying farms burning down homes and it's a eugenicists assault on the
[41:59.760 --> 42:02.720]  third world and it's coming home this is why they want us to live in a
[42:02.720 --> 42:07.640]  plandopolis with meat rations and the fact that we have to apply for permission
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.400]  to the government to drive a car once a week so it's all coming home this is the
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.760]  plan they've got for mankind and now the geoengineering cloud is up there
[42:16.760 --> 42:21.400]  conducting experiments throwing sulfur particles into the atmosphere again to
[42:21.400 --> 42:25.240]  stop global warming these people in their own documents talk about how they
[42:25.240 --> 42:29.320]  want a global planetary regime to sterilize and kill everybody and they're
[42:29.320 --> 42:32.560]  now in the White House they've got the multi-million dollar scientific budgets
[42:32.560 --> 42:36.680]  and they're gonna have that way and that's the thing is that over the years
[42:36.680 --> 42:40.120]  going to college and then being in events with media and going to smart
[42:40.120 --> 42:43.560]  growth conferences I'd be like you know this is a death sentence to the third
[42:43.560 --> 42:46.600]  world and they'll just look at you with these crazed eyes and go it doesn't
[42:46.600 --> 42:51.000]  matter you can't stop us Jones the thing is a mid-level and upper level they
[42:51.000 --> 42:55.280]  know it's about a power grab and about killing people and they're racist and
[42:55.280 --> 42:58.800]  they committed they said how are we gonna kill these black weeds as Margaret
[42:58.800 --> 43:03.360]  Sanger said and these brown weeds and she said we've got to pose as liberals to
[43:03.360 --> 43:08.240]  get their trust these are quotes so we can kill these subhumans and and and
[43:08.240 --> 43:13.280]  they are so vicious they are so evil I've even talked to black socialist and
[43:13.280 --> 43:16.960]  people and they won't discuss the abortion issue it's their sacrament
[43:16.960 --> 43:25.520]  it's their weird sickening disgusting out-of-control power trip and and they'll
[43:25.520 --> 43:28.960]  even say to you well there are too many people and and they get off on it
[43:28.960 --> 43:32.920]  meanwhile they're having their food manipulated their water manipulated as
[43:32.920 --> 43:39.400]  well well I mean it's obviously as he said that you get to a certain level and
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.160]  they know exactly what they're doing it's like Bill Clinton at the global
[43:43.160 --> 43:48.360]  initiative earlier this week says that you know Calderon stepped up to the plate
[43:48.360 --> 43:53.200]  because he helped plant half of the 1 million trees at their bio diversity
[43:53.200 --> 43:56.880]  agenda call for what they don't tell you is that he also kicked off all these
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.280]  people from their land now they're living in absolute squalor and poverty and
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.600]  dying as a result of this but I mean this is the agenda this is why they
[44:05.600 --> 44:10.080]  headed their way from Mexico this has been going on since the 80s and so in a
[44:10.080 --> 44:13.480]  way again I don't blame the illegals they're just trying to live a better
[44:13.480 --> 44:17.860]  life they were driven off their land the point is then they're brought here put
[44:17.860 --> 44:22.280]  on welfare taught to be anti-second amendment it these globalists have got
[44:22.280 --> 44:26.160]  to be dealt with and they've got to be called out Paul Watson good job I want

[45:32.240 --> 45:35.560]  statehood deal this is all planned to blow up the Middle East and get World
[45:35.560 --> 45:38.640]  War three going okay everybody wants me to cover it I've covered it nauseam
[45:38.640 --> 45:42.560]  Israel's not going anywhere it's meant to start a big war but you'll see we're
[45:42.560 --> 45:48.560]  gonna get to that coming up just just absolutely amazing of course nobody
[45:48.560 --> 45:52.000]  wants to talk about the 30,000 mostly black living in Sfleet town tens of
[45:52.000 --> 45:55.360]  thousands of dead black stacked up everywhere all over the country I want
[45:55.360 --> 46:00.680]  to talk about that because it's not the cause celeb it's not the trendiness now
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.400]  going to Aaron Dykes he's there with Darren McBree and they followed
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.760]  incredible reports that are up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[46:10.760 --> 46:15.040]  video reports text reports are working with Kurt Nemo those are going up right
[46:15.040 --> 46:18.720]  now they've been to a bunch of drills so far there's more drills just like in
[46:18.720 --> 46:23.240]  Chicago the drill for arresting people and putting them in a FEMA camp that's
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.800]  even Fox News isn't allowed into that and we confirmed this happened in Chicago
[46:27.800 --> 46:32.600]  last year that's in our film we had our guys there as well Aaron Dykes tell us
[46:32.600 --> 46:36.880]  what you're witnessing up there in Denver well it's total planned chaos of
[46:36.880 --> 46:40.600]  course Alex the whole drill is so gigantic that it's completely kind of part
[46:40.600 --> 46:44.920]  mentalized over more than a hundred government agencies but it's all
[46:44.920 --> 46:49.240]  coordinated at the top from Department of Homeland Security who paid for the
[46:49.240 --> 46:56.240]  grant that paid for the entire massive 10th location drill that's going on today
[46:56.240 --> 47:00.360]  now what's the main goal we know they do these to create an illusion of a real
[47:00.360 --> 47:03.760]  terror threat to shut down many parts of the city and create fear it's a
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.080]  federalization drill of course I know you talked to Homeland Security official
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.520]  who said it's all federal yeah that's right they did the grant as I said from
[47:12.520 --> 47:17.240]  the top down and all these agencies are more than happy to be integrated into it
[47:17.240 --> 47:22.360]  Alex I would say overall this is a preparation for the very things Homeland
[47:22.360 --> 47:27.160]  Security told us to now expect from domestic terror attacks including
[47:27.160 --> 47:33.000]  sports stadium locations shopping mall locations school locations train station
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.720]  locations and the rest of its community college and elementary schools Alex
[47:37.720 --> 47:42.280]  we've seen those all in the propaganda videos that get ready for that and we
[47:42.280 --> 47:46.160]  were just inside the live school shooting drill and they claimed it was a
[47:46.160 --> 47:50.160]  generic terrorist but what it looked like was a returning veteran he was
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.360]  dressed in fatigued he had on gloves he was a real kind of prepared shooter with
[47:55.360 --> 47:59.720]  an AR-15 type weapon or something similar we know even the New York Times
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.440]  reports Explorer scout station-wide are quote train to take on disgruntled vets
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.640]  and quote take them out right and then secondarily they're using the trauma
[48:09.640 --> 48:13.840]  based Psyop against these children where they've made to participate in the
[48:13.840 --> 48:17.640]  drills what we're grown men over here we were a little shocked by the loud
[48:17.640 --> 48:21.920]  explosions and shooting sounds inside the school meanwhile they've got first and
[48:21.920 --> 48:25.920]  second graders and older children as well evacuating the building and being
[48:25.920 --> 48:30.440]  subjected to these yeah every school in the country government training camp is
[48:30.440 --> 48:33.840]  really a reeducation camp so you're saying they actually had the children in
[48:33.840 --> 48:37.640]  this one sometimes they don't they don't even announce it to the children as
[48:37.640 --> 48:41.280]  young as five and come in and tell them they're gonna kill them all trauma based
[48:41.280 --> 48:45.120]  mind control while we're showing footage shot from the iPhone that's up at
[48:45.120 --> 48:48.560]  info wars.com of your prison planet dot TV if you were right now if you're
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.040]  radio listening go to info wars and watch it we were just showing the SWAT
[48:52.040 --> 48:56.200]  teams running around in a school what type of public school was it and how
[48:56.200 --> 49:01.040]  old were the children? Right as I said the children were as young as first grade
[49:01.040 --> 49:07.880]  and this was medley elementary school yes medley elementary school I have the
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.640]  address if you want it. Unbelievable we're seeing the footage here so they had
[49:12.640 --> 49:19.920]  children as young as six years of age first grade going through this and you
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.480]  said there were explosions shooting I was also reading that there's got
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.480]  helicopters flying around in troops this is basically a giant fear hop over
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.760]  the city. That's exactly right of course they publicized it ahead of time they
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.360]  said don't be worried get ready for loud explosions smoke and the rest of it and
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.560]  so again inside the school they had the fire alarms going off they simulated
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.160]  shots and explosions it was very loud they required us to wear earplugs but
[49:45.160 --> 49:48.800]  at least they didn't let us in whereas at the ball location they were so
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.080]  paranoid from their top-down security that they wouldn't even let us in the
[49:53.080 --> 49:56.760]  parking lot without a little harassment whereas at the elementary school they
[49:56.760 --> 50:00.960]  let us right in and we were able to follow the SWAT team from very close
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.920]  distance without any interference. Unbelievable we're seeing the low quality
[50:04.920 --> 50:08.520]  video you uploaded basically instantly and we're gonna get the high quality as

[54:04.440 --> 54:16.080]  okay more than 100 agencies are descending on Denver they do this in
[54:16.080 --> 54:20.320]  many other cities as well just creating this illusion that there are
[54:20.320 --> 54:24.400]  terrorists everywhere you better give your liberties up and of course the
[54:24.400 --> 54:28.440]  conspiracy theories have started it's like why is the Homeland Security guy
[54:28.440 --> 54:32.720]  talking to them at the mall shooting drill and how did they get into the
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.880]  school drill it's never about hey look they got little kids training for
[54:36.880 --> 54:41.080]  martial law and they're traumatizing them it's always weird Vatican
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.160]  assassins or something because you guys never get up never go out never do
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.400]  anything okay media has been blocked from some events but not from others and
[54:50.400 --> 54:55.360]  of course Cointel pro always turns it back on us so it's about us instead of
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.520]  about the events that are taking place I know do and them got in last year as
[54:59.520 --> 55:03.000]  they went and signed up with the media and and witches to train and to take on
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.720]  the domestic ribs just like I went to urban warfare drills I remember in 98
[55:07.720 --> 55:12.240]  and and what is the Marines training to take our guns and people then didn't say
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.560]  oh he's in the drills he must be a globalist instead of responding to the
[55:15.560 --> 55:21.360]  drill they said oh this is fake the hovercraft the the troop carrying ships
[55:21.360 --> 55:28.720]  none of this is real anyway you can not to address the issue of that the
[55:28.720 --> 55:31.840]  government saying terror attacks are coming we're gonna have to take your
[55:31.840 --> 55:35.920]  rights groping you at the football stadiums groping you at the malls it's
[55:35.920 --> 55:41.120]  all happening now going back to Aaron Dykes Aaron that is a good question
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.200]  overall though you they're letting you into some events but not into others you
[55:45.200 --> 55:48.920]  say you talked to some media folks who are and that you guys are not allowed
[55:48.920 --> 55:53.280]  into the sports stadium but they did let some media into this high school so
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.320]  I'll break that question down that's right Alex in fact I wanted to address
[55:57.320 --> 56:00.440]  that it's the compartmentalization exactly like you would see if there was a
[56:00.440 --> 56:04.960]  9-11 type of van where there's plausible deniability and ignorance you
[56:04.960 --> 56:08.600]  could see the SWAT team guys were working hard doing a good job that kind of
[56:08.600 --> 56:13.760]  thing the different agencies but then their coordinators coming interrogate
[56:13.760 --> 56:17.880]  us and when we're at the mall location they had different security patrols a
[56:17.880 --> 56:22.240]  local county one one for the mall and one for the federal and they kept coming
[56:22.240 --> 56:27.120]  by asking us questions even though we checked in as media now we talked with
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.800]  a mainstream reporter while we're at the school shooting drill where they were
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.840]  very nice unlike the mall location let us in he said his fellow compatriots were
[56:35.840 --> 56:39.280]  at the stadium they were at the mall they were at the other location including
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.640]  the union station the train station and they were not given access to any of the
[56:44.640 --> 56:48.200]  events they weren't allowed to see the actual visuals they're up on a riser
[56:48.200 --> 56:51.400]  where they could film the general area but they can't actually see what's going
[56:51.400 --> 56:55.920]  on that was not the case at the element school and I guess it's due to the
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.840]  compartmentalization because they let us right in and you know we of course
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.040]  identified as media and called media contact yeah well that's the key to all
[57:04.040 --> 57:09.280]  this now now continuing here Aaron I'm reading in the news about helicopters
[57:09.280 --> 57:13.800]  bomb drills more of that is coming up what did you see along that line I saw
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.560]  highway signs flashing that a security drills going on I mean this is really
[57:18.560 --> 57:22.280]  just about creating the illusion that terrorism is the most dangerous thing in
[57:22.280 --> 57:27.400]  the world when slipping on wet cement is about a thousand times more dangerous
[57:27.400 --> 57:31.080]  yeah that's right we've seen streets blocked off particularly by the
[57:31.080 --> 57:35.560]  elementary school by the mall we saw the signs the video we posted earlier
[57:35.560 --> 57:39.920]  warning of the public exercise drill going on that was all around the highways
[57:39.920 --> 57:46.280]  certain names were blocked off what was also interesting was the state local and
[57:46.280 --> 57:52.200]  county level vehicles all had giant massive counterterrorism hazmat bomb
[57:52.200 --> 57:58.680]  drill huge RVs set up as cordon stations at the mall location where they're
[57:58.680 --> 58:02.440]  planning for the shooting drill again not taking out the shooter or preventing
[58:02.440 --> 58:06.840]  any deaths but just blocking off the area and taking command it and getting
[58:06.840 --> 58:11.320]  ready to you know make a big scene after the fact also interesting was they had
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.960]  the SWAT teams on top of these bands and up on the mall where they had almost a
[58:15.960 --> 58:22.320]  parapet kind of a second level location where they had SWAT prime for a sniper
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.360]  and so forth yeah this is all a martial law takeover drill for the public is for
[58:26.360 --> 58:30.200]  fear-mongering to create the perception the threat is real but internally it's
[58:30.200 --> 58:34.760]  all about threat fusion centers homeland security a full federalization system
[58:34.760 --> 58:38.520]  it's like testing nerve endings they're testing the takeover and take down of
[58:38.520 --> 58:49.040]  America this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.640]  Africans for their land you can't make this stuff up right now Aaron Dykes and
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.880]  Darren McBreen info wars nightly news reporters are on the scene they're in
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.720]  Denver they've been to all sorts of drills they've got over a hundred going
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.240]  on army military police under local control going under federal control
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.600]  incredible information at Operation Mountain Guardian and Aaron you were
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.320]  just telling me some incredible information before we finish up with you
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.720]  and go to Darren McBreen for his take on this right so again for those who don't
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.480]  know how we got in there this was a public exercise where the media was
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.040]  invited we have the press police in front of us and we contacted those press
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.480]  Aaron don't even worry about that I was just telling that story as a joke we all
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.920]  know the Vatican got us in but but but and along with space aliens but but I
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.600]  mean getting back to the stuff you were telling me about the next drill coming
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.960]  up well that's what I was trying to tell you is that these media contacts have
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.600]  told us they're about to stage an event carried out against the train they've
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.720]  done a separate event already at the train station of course there's five more
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:54.640]  hours of this large exercise going on there's also activity at the Denver
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.960]  International Airport and sports authority field at mile high stadium as
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.800]  well as several medical centers and a university so we're about to go check
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.640]  that stuff out but notice is the sports stadiums they don't want people in it's
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.080]  like when I sit and do and Douglas up to Chicago the unannounced Alex yeah even
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.200]  fucked news well they didn't announce a final drill but then my guys still find
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.000]  out about it or mass roundups at the sports stadium in Chicago so they don't
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.480]  want you seeing that Aaron do whatever you have to to get up on a tall building
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.920]  whatever get footage of what's happening did you bring the super
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:36.080]  telephoto Panasonic camera I got we have the HDB which has a very large zoom it
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.520]  goes quite a ways nobody by the cameras with lesser zoom well do whatever you
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.000]  have to great job I'm sorry go ahead and finish up what you were saying Aaron
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.280]  well I simply spoke with one of the media contact personnel asked if there was
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:55.800]  anything in the drills related to mass evacuation you know temporary detention
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:00.680]  for mass mass of people etc and she kind of laughed instead of there's many
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.040]  locations but I can't tell you about that you have to call the head contact
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.760]  because she was compartmentalized it's all about defense on those leads and
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.760]  we'll have more reports to come out all right good let me get a brief comment
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.680]  from Darren McBrain info wars.com reporter Darren in about a minute and
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:20.320]  a half what's your overall view of what you witnessed well hey I'm just catching
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.920]  up with Aaron we got separated for a little bit but a very realistic drill
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.880]  inside of the Smedley Elementary School compound you know in Denver Colorado as
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.520]  you know this is all part of Operation Mountain Guardian brought to you by
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:38.000]  Homeland Security in FEMA not all of Aaron told you that there's over 100
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:42.520]  different agencies participating and what can only be called a it's a massive
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:48.000]  exercise out now we were inside Smedley Elementary School and I'm telling you it
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.320]  gets about as real as you could possibly imagine there was a SWAT task force team
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:57.920]  that simulated gunfire there were sirens multiple casualties you know
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.120]  teenagers role playing pretending like they're dead or injured and you know
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.800]  they were riddled throughout the compound and a very surreal experience
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:10.720]  we even got close to the actual terrorists or the simulated terrorists if
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:15.760]  you will yeah I don't know Aaron he kind of looked like a military guy an ex

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.120]  brewing or a global food crisis that's why I'm telling everyone to read the
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.560]  new book rising prices empty shelves warning signs that trigger the deadliest
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:41.680]  famines in history don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits this

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:20.880]  okay for the next 25 minutes or so we are joined by one of the new directors of
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.440]  juicer preservation of firearms ownership which is a great Second
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.400]  Amendment organization really hits the gun grabbers where it hurts pointing out
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:34.600]  that authoritarians always try to take guns counters the controlled
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.280]  socialistic left always saying it's a civil right to have your guns taken and
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.000]  shows that the first gun laws were against blacks and others then of course
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.560]  Hitler was for gun control and it's a very good counterbalance to the ADL
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.760]  Southern Prairie Law Center and others that are always out there viciously
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.120]  going after the Second Amendment then coming up I'm gonna get into the
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:58.400]  economy big developments obviously there with a plunging stock market QE3 and
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:02.120]  more we've got our reporters in the ground on the ground in Denver for this
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:07.760]  mountain guardian martial law takeover drilled we've got incredible news
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.160]  dealing with what we told you about this a month ago UN Security Council
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.200]  climate change peacekeeping green helmets while the green helmets have
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.400]  hit armed troops burned down homes killed children to evict Ugandans in name of
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.840]  global warming they took their property saying that they've got to balance the
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:29.080]  carbon footprint of the country and then sold the carbon footprint to liberal
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.960]  trendies who buy it to put stickers on their cars to feel like they're doing a
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.960]  good job you can't make this type of eugenics up this type of extermination
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:44.800]  packaged in sickening liberal trendiness so that's all coming up but again
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:49.800]  time flies I can't believe it was 2010 Aaron Zellman died I remember talking
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.680]  about it and then I was reading here and I'm like we didn't have six months go
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.080]  didn't have an eight months go didn't have nine months ago Aaron Zellman it
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.240]  really hardcore defender of the Second Amendment been interviewing him for 16
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.160]  years and I didn't even heard he was sick and then to hurt he passed which is
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:11.200]  sad but he led a certainly a good life defending freedom and so we are joined
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:15.880]  right now by one of the new directors of the organization and I do want to hear
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.240]  more about exactly who's a Han showing things over there and that's why he's
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:25.200]  with us rabbi David Bendori and he's been the rabbinic director for years but
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:29.160]  now is I guess expanding his role there and it's a good to have you here with
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.600]  us today I'm thrilled to be here thanks so much for having me Alex so out of the
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.160]  gate tell us about JPFO.org well let's talk about Aaron a little bit what a
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.480]  what a what a guy who certainly made some big accomplishments for liberty in
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.900]  his life yes Aaron Zellman was a force to be reckoned with he established he
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:54.360]  founded JPFO about 20 years ago he was just disgusted by the fact that the
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.440]  dominant to Jewish voices with regard to the issues of Second Amendment rights
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.800]  and firearms ownership were all anti and he couldn't understand it it
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.560]  disgusted him so he went out and he did something about it he established use
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.040]  for the preservation of firearms ownership and led the organization for
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:14.280]  a little over 20 years until as you just described his untimely death in
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:21.400]  December of 2010. Well his work will live on for a long time now now what is
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.840]  JPFO doing today because you've got gun owners of America that's a good
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.680]  organization then then you've got the NRA that sells out a lot but when it
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.720]  comes to really putting out pamphlets videos ideas and really identifying
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:42.840]  crimes of the ATF JPFO has been the leader. We very much try to take the lead
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.520]  in the places that some of those other gun organizations can't go there are
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:51.760]  things we can and do say that they will not and above all we will not
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:57.280]  compromise and we will not sell out so where the NRA might get involved in
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.600]  lobbying and politics which leads them to all sorts of compromise we are an
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.640]  educational organization we seek to provide educational materials what we
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.840]  call intellectual ammunition to use against the gun grabbers and that
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:15.040]  includes pamphlets that includes various email alerts that includes videos
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.600]  that we've done lectures that I've done all sorts of materials that are filled
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:25.760]  with a different approach to gun control we approach the the issue from
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.720]  a completely different angle and as informed by Jewish history and by Jewish
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:35.440]  law. Well I mean from my research about a hundred percent of the time when
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:40.080]  governments take guns or arms from people they become slaves very very
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:43.360]  quickly and I know that's your historical perspective and it's it's
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.680]  really gotten the word out there so people realize how hardcore this is but
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.640]  specifically from a Jewish perspective I think this is important because I know
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:55.560]  that I've gone to anti-gun meetings many years ago in Austin and a lot of times
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.760]  they would be at local liberal synagogues and I would go there and try to
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.400]  you know during question and answer say this is wrong this is a bad idea and
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:06.800]  they would get very very upset and you know try to imply I was some type of
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.920]  Nazi infiltrator or something to the meeting so I think that's what's so good
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.960]  that JPFO is countering you know some of the folks out there who claim to speak
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:22.120]  specifically for Jews saying that it's I guess you know Jewish law or something
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.160]  to hand in your weapons which I don't see in the in the Bible or the Torah. No
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.640]  most certainly not in fact the very first project that I did for JPFO was
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.520]  called the Ten Commandments of Self-Defense. The Ten Commandments of
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.000]  Self-Defense is an hour-long lecture that goes through a selection of sources
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.120]  from Jewish law. I chose 18 sources there are many many more that I could have
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:47.080]  gone to but I chose 18 sources ranging from the Torah, the Old Testament, to
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:51.680]  rabbinic sources, to more modern sources that look at the questions surrounding
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:56.760]  self-defense, questions surrounding firearms ownership and ask what does
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:02.160]  Jewish law have to say about this issue? Is Jewish law in favor or opposed to
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.720]  disarmament? Is Jewish law in favor or opposed to self-defense? When it comes
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.520]  down to at the end of the day is a very simple statement which is God has given
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:17.880]  you life and to refuse to fail to defend the life of the innocent is to hold
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:23.840]  that gift from God in contempt and so as as people who love life as people who
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.200]  cherish the gifts that God has given us we have an obligation to defend life. In
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:33.080]  modern times one of the best tools that we have at our hands at our disposal to
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:36.900]  defend life is the modern handgun. It levels the playing field in
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:41.520]  terms of self-defense and so Jewish law is very clear that you have an
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:45.760]  obligation to defend the innocent, to defend your own life, to defend the
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:50.880]  lives of the innocent around you and to use whatever tools are necessary to do
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:57.200]  so. You know for those out there who don't know the Old Testament or the
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:02.800]  Torah and go through some of the I mean I know I'm springing this on you if you've
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:07.080]  got them in front of you Rabbi go through what the Torah what the Bible
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.800]  actually says versus what we also see in Christian churches a lot of them now
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.960]  I've seen Catholic churches pamphlets Baptist churches saying it's of God
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:20.040]  turn your guns in I mean this is something that the big World Council of
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:23.040]  churches and others aren't just trying to push through synagogues they're
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:27.080]  pushing it across the board. I can't comment on the churches but I can't
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.120]  comment on the Jewish sources I'm holding my hand actually I thought you
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:33.680]  might ask me such a question so I'm holding the study guide that we
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.440]  distribute along with that CD the Ten Commandments of Self-Defense this has
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:44.960]  the 18 sources that I chose as part of as part of that audio lecture so I will
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:52.520]  just choose the first one the first one deals with the case of a potential
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.320]  murderer someone who is who is out to kill another person we call it in Hebrew
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.680]  Rodeff a pursuer so in the case of a pursuer you have an obligation in Jewish
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.560]  law to use any means necessary to protect the innocent life of the person
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:11.920]  being pursued and in fact in Jewish law we equate the pursuer with intent to
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.360]  murder to the pursuer with intent to rape or in other words once someone is
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.600]  going to cause what I'll characterize as grave bodily harm that person is in the
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.440]  category of a pursuer that Jewish law obligates us to to prevent such an
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.560]  attack to prevent such an occurrence from happening what's that based on it all
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.440]  goes back to a case in the book of Exodus the case is of a criminal who is
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:38.800]  tunneling into someone's house in the middle of the night and what the book
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.760]  of Exodus tells us is that if a criminal is caught tunneling under the wall to
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.560]  get into someone's home in the middle of the night the homeowner or anyone else
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.120]  can strike that person down and kill them it's assumed that they are out to
[01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:57.800]  harm the people inside that they are not only after property that they are
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.480]  going to cause mortal harm to the people inside and so one can actively
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:08.600]  defend against such a such a perpetrator by the way rabbi we're gonna have you
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.960]  back up as we got about 15 minutes left in the future to a whole hour on this
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.280]  but I'm seeing parallels with English and European common law I mean this is
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.800]  just common sense somebody's trying to break in your house at night it's common
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:26.040]  sense you got a right to kill him mm-hmm well in fact Alex the the basis of a
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:31.560]  lot of English English law European common law comes from Roman law which
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:35.280]  is very very closely connected with the Jewish law of the Talmudic period
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.840]  approximately 1500 to 2000 years ago a lot of very similar jurisprudence a lot
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.720]  of similar con concepts so for example you're describing is called the castle
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.200]  doctrine the castle doctrine isn't called that but it appears in rabbinic
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.520]  literature and it's discussed in exactly the terms that you're describing if
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.280]  someone is breaking into your home what are the assumptions you can make can you
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.800]  assume that this person is going to take property and leave or do you have to
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.840]  assume that you have a right to assume in fact are you obligated to assume that
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.200]  this person is out to cause you bodily harm that this person is out to harm your
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.000]  family and they can run down the road and do it to somebody else so you've got a
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:13.680]  responsibility to put them down you've got if they're trying to get into your home you
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:17.120]  have a responsibility to do something about that absolutely Jewish law in fact
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.360]  looks at this as a question of responsibility much more than a
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:23.760]  question of rights most of Jewish law looks at our responsibilities and we
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:27.720]  have a responsibility to cause a to create and construct a civil society
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:31.320]  this person is behaving in a way that is outside of the boundaries of civil
[01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:35.720]  society and doing so they have given up their quote-unquote rights and once
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:39.640]  they've given up those rights you have responsibilities to maintain that civil
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.400]  society we're going to break in a moment but let's get to number two what was
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.280]  number two you want a second source no I mean there's so many I just find it
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:51.520]  interesting well throw a second one at you the rambam my monities who lived
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.440]  about 800 years ago he actually extends this further there are questions about
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.520]  at what point this I'll call it the castle doctrine applies in rabbinic law
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:03.520]  according to my monities the castle doctrine applies not just to someone
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:07.400]  breaking into your home but if someone is doing what we would call criminal
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.200]  trespass once that person is on your property uninvited and refuses to leave
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.240]  meaning they've taken some active step to demonstrate that they are up to no
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.480]  good once they have refused to leave that constitutes criminal trespass that
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:24.800]  is sufficient according to my monities to justify the use of force to get them
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.320]  to leave your property and that's why today you've got to have the sign saying
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.520]  don't come on my land that's the upfront warning that would be the upfront
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.720]  warning in today's society that's right unless of course you live in Texas in
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:40.280]  which case presumably no warning is necessary yeah we'll be right back
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.120]  interesting stuff we can spend hours that's good to know JPFO is still out

[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.760]  want to see it there but getting into the history of gun control across the
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:35.600]  board and well the nightmares that basically appear as soon as populations
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.200]  are disarmed you've made a big study of this and so is JPFO tell us about it
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:46.280]  we have spent a lot of time on this topic at JPFO in fact we have two well
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:50.520]  more than two the two that were on my mind that are targeting specific
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.640]  populations we have a video called no guns for juice we have another video
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.960]  called no guns for Negroes and no guns for Negroes looks at gun control as a
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.560]  tool of oppression against blacks no guns for Jews obviously does the same
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.680]  looking at Jews we have another video called innocence betrayed which looks
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:12.200]  at the history of gun control as a predecessor to genocide throughout the
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:19.000]  20th century as used by by the Soviet Union by Lenin as used in China as used
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.520]  against the Armenians in Turkey and of course as used against the Jews during
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:27.400]  the Holocaust but in fact the history of gun control goes back far longer than
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.160]  that I'm always fascinated I ask people what was the first recorded historical
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:37.960]  gun control event the first for historic gun control document and people
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.640]  typically think this goes back a few hundred years in fact it's much older
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.160]  than that and the first known historic source that has anything to do with gun
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.400]  control goes back to biblical times in fact the first book of Samuel in the
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.040]  Old Testament chapter 13 verse 19 talks about the first use of gun control now
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.880]  of course we're not talking about guns we're talking about swords the the guns
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.800]  of that time as it were the weaponry of that time swords bows and arrows
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.920]  spears the Bible tells us that there were no smiths no blacksmiths found
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.280]  among the Jewish people and the Philistines who were of course their
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.840]  enemies at the time said well we don't want the Jews to be able to make any
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.960]  swords or spears and so what they did is they essentially declared a moratorium
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:34.400]  on sharpening tools for Jews they made the price of sharpening a tool even a
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:39.560]  plow exorbitant and so just a few verses later were told that on the day of
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:44.160]  battle against the Philistines there were no swords or spears among all of
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.320]  the Jewish people in the entire Jewish army saved to one in the hand of Saul
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:52.480]  that's King Saul and one in the hand of Jonathan his son that's right back then
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:57.000]  they mainly use slings they use slings that's right David of course King who
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.640]  was to become king use a sling but in terms of in terms of manufactured
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:08.200]  weaponry it was swords and swords shields bows and arrows that's what was
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:13.520]  available and the Philistines disarmed the Jews in order to defeat us in battle
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.880]  they of course failed because we had a weapon that they can't disarm us from and
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:23.120]  that is of course God provided for the Jewish people then and and helped us be
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:27.440]  triumphant in that battle but that's the first recorded gun control that's
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:34.600]  about 3,000 years ago if I fast forward you go to about roughly 22 I'm sorry
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:39.640]  yes about 2,200 years ago to the book of Esther the time of the Jewish
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:45.840]  dispersion in Persia so I'll remind your listeners or those who aren't familiar
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.120]  with the biblical sources the the book of Esther deals with a king named Akhash
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.280]  Veroche who is paid by a man named Haman who wants to wipe out the entire
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:02.080]  Jewish people and he gets a decree from the king saying that the people of
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:06.240]  Persia are allowed to attack Jews with impunity on a particular date and so
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.880]  Esther who is the Jewish Queen at the time she implores the king to save her
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:19.360]  people and we're told I'll give you the exact quote King the king declares quote
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  the king had granted that the Jews were in every city to gather themselves
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.360]  together to stand for their life to destroy to slay to cause to perish all
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.680]  the forces of the people in province that would assault them or in other words
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.600]  the king gave the Jews the right to defend themselves so clearly if the
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:38.480]  king had to give them the right to defend themselves prior to that we had a
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.880]  decree Jews aren't allowed to defend themselves which is how their enemies were
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:47.040]  to be triumphant so this has been a tool this gun control this idea of weapon
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.920]  control has been a tool used to oppress the Jewish people for thousands of
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.120]  thousands of years and no guns for Jews actually go through that history
[01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.120]  coming all the way up into modern times gun control weapons control arms and
[01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:01.360]  bargos as used against the state of Israel to prevent the Jews there from
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.800]  defending themselves well rabbi I've been Dora we have to leave it there but it
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.720]  was great haven't you want to look forward to having you back up to look at
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.240]  more history because it's just amazing and we see it in every other culture
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.760]  throughout history it's very fundamental if anybody tries to disarm you
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:19.160]  you're a slave you're a prisoner and blacks couldn't have guns obviously when
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:21.920]  they were slaves here and then even after they were freed first gun control laws

[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.320]  when they see it and look I'll put the call out again to listeners because I
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.440]  know a tiny fraction of our millions of radio listeners our prison planet dot
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:48.320]  TV subscribers I know that I know that a handful of you are prison planet dot
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.960]  TV subscribers and that handful has helped us launch the nightly news to
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.200]  make the films to do the news websites to have the reporters the posters the
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:04.920]  webmasters the producers the board ops the directors all of it but we're
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.960]  adding a lot we're adding the rant section where I'm doing more and more of
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.360]  these spontaneous rants on the weekend and uploading them there for my iPhone
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.600]  or from a home computer the special report section that has an expanded
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:19.440]  interview with Dr. Wakefield and more from just a few days ago the nightly
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:24.080]  news five nights a week and then of course Alex Jones live that's this
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:29.320]  three-hour radio TV show every day and we've got ebooks there as well we've
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:34.600]  got all of my films and a lot more all at prison planet dot TV you can also get
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:40.440]  there by going to info wars news.com and think about the revolution you're
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:45.200]  involved in when you're a member you are funding this entire operation and the
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.680]  fact that we're able to send reporters places the fact that we're able to
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.120]  cover big issues that more and more become national news stories all the
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:58.400]  time now news stories that we break or analysis that we put out ends up being
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.600]  the number one story on the web some days I mean years ago I'd have one of
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.160]  those a year now every couple weeks we're in the top three or four stories on
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.720]  the web according to Alexa Yahoo Google and other systems we are reaching
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:16.200]  millions and millions of people think about it I've made films like in-game
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.480]  Obama deception fall the Republic in-game conservatively tens of millions of
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:27.200]  viewers Obama deception over 35 million last time I counted it up on the
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.960]  different YouTube channels and Google and other video platforms for free out
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:39.160]  there 35 million people on a film that cost $100,000 to make 35 million people
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.760]  I'm not successful in the capital department but Glenn Beck doesn't have
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.040]  anything that's been seen 35 million times everything he's done together all
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:51.640]  his books his documentaries don't come near that only thing that's bigger than
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:56.040]  that was the TV show and again not in competition with Glenn Beck I wish he
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.600]  was a true anti-globalist 100% he's certainly better than George Soros I
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:06.840]  mean he's gotten better over the years my point is we're the real McCoy you know
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:11.440]  we started offering Tuesday show Wednesday free in the M4 Wars insider
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:15.480]  newsletter so he started offering his Tuesday show free on Wednesdays he
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:19.320]  started to doing his fourth hour of radio for subscribers only that's something
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.160]  we started five years ago I mean it's great to be imitated but then also be
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:29.440]  attacked behind the scenes I don't like that side issue the point is Al Gore
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:35.540]  reportedly according to London Telegraph got 17,500 viewers to his 24 hours of
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:42.080]  baloney ladies and gentlemen just with our subscribers and the fact that I'll
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:45.680]  allow the passcode to be shared we've done the math guess how many people tune
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.200]  into the show every night at prismplanet.tv we're talking about close to a
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:56.120]  hundred thousand people because it streams once and then it streams all
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:39:00.360]  night you add all those together 600 something thousand downloading the free
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:05.520]  podcast every day over 300,000 listing the free audio streams every single
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:11.320]  day all added up together number one on shoutcast number one we were number
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:15.120]  number one ladies and gentlemen what just last month when the numbers came
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:20.760]  out not number one in talk radio number one period on shoutcast is one way we
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:28.560]  stream free audio think about that we have been wildly successful in fighting
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.720]  globalists and that's why I didn't just sit there and so I'll just keep doing
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.280]  things like making a film here and writing a book there doing a special
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.760]  report here or there no making ourselves go to the next level and really it's
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:44.640]  been it's been exhilarating busting our hind ends to put out these special
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:49.000]  reports in the nightly news shows and I found it invigorating to actually work
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.440]  even more and do new things and we've got a lot more new coming down the road
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:58.680]  I'm gonna try a lot of new things out in the fight and there's nowhere where your
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.840]  support is having a bigger effect you cannot deny it now maybe you were a
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.040]  prison planet on TV member eight years ago or six years ago it's been around
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.880]  eight and a half years now we've added so much more higher quality bandwidth more
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.480]  options the films and higher quality everything there but I know that's why
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:20.680]  most of you aren't even members for that reason you're there to support us now
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:25.120]  it's a more powerful tool now you can download it easier and share it now you
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.600]  can share your passcode with even more people I'm thinking about turning it up
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.520]  to 10 people being able to use the same passcode at the same time
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:38.280]  simultaneously the problem is there's some server issues not with streaming it
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.720]  to that many people but there's some issues with the actual platform servers
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:49.000]  themselves I mean it you know the site itself not even the media but we're
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.040]  working on that and then they show me graphs that that'll eat up any profit
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:57.680]  we've got we need to then invest into more reporters more equipment more I'm
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.720]  trying here and quite frankly I've been searching for a long time for somebody
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:05.520]  better than me because I found somebody better than I was and I'm just I'm
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.240]  certainly not perfect I would hire them and immediately thrust them into a
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:14.560]  leadership position I've tried to work with other people a lot a lot of times
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:19.120]  you get them around you and they go crazy and try to you know lie about you
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:25.200]  thinking like they'll kill the king or something politically or they will just
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.160]  flip out with the amount of power they get it just I guess it takes a hermit
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:34.120]  like myself who just wants to go home in a well-paint or go home and water
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.040]  plants in the yard to be able to deal with all this stress and all the
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:42.720]  craziness and and quite frankly the notoriety that comes with it but we're
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:47.560]  finding good folks who aren't mentally ill and and and and who are great people
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.520]  like Mike Adams people like Aaron Dykes who has to be made to go on TV and made
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.280]  to go on the radio and we're we're because I want to get to a point where
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:00.040]  you don't hear Alex Jones on the air except maybe once a week not because I
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.840]  don't want to be doing the work but because we need more people we need more
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.480]  people that get a full spectrum breakdown analysis of what's happening we
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.920]  need more people we need more leaders we need them and I've always felt God on
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:21.000]  my move me in my heart that that I'm looking for the real leader that that's
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.880]  that's what I'm here for that I am going to trigger things with you that are
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.280]  going to lead to the destruction of the globalist and Ron Paul said that as well
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.480]  he knows that even if they cheat him he doesn't win he's won by becoming a top
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.440]  tier candidate and injecting real issues so that as everything he talked
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.640]  about completely comes true it will be remembered and he knows he's talking
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.840]  about it's a war of ideas he's trying to change the course of history he's
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.320]  trying to to get a new group of people young people to not see the socialist
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.280]  mode or the controlled right-wing fascist mode but to see the liberty
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.800]  liberty way not the false left-right paradigm and the Bilderberg group
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.760]  reportedly going back four years ago and again two years ago is very upset the
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:07.440]  number one growing group and now in many cases number one period is not
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:12.480]  communists not fake environmentalists not socialists not neocons fake republicans
[01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:18.640]  but what you'd call Ron Paul Alex Jones type libertarians who really get it who
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.040]  really get what's happening how the ultra rich use the dependent welfare
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:27.640]  class as a weapon against the middle class the rediscovery of history and so
[01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.320]  that's what feels good at the end of the day I know I have committed so much time
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:36.240]  and energy and so much research and so much passion that we have already really
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.280]  wounded the global is bad they're bleeding all over the floor I mean they
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.680]  got there I mean they are bleeding we have stabbed them quite a bit it's a
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.720]  powerful dragon but it's got its guts hanging out right now it's blood all
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:51.760]  over the floor we're bleeding bad too but it doesn't matter just just keep
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:57.160]  stabbing and stabbing that's what matters oh the dragon just bit into me
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:02.760]  that's even better now I'm right by your eyes oh yes it's that commitment who
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.720]  energy in against the machine total commitment I don't care what you say or
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.240]  what you do I'm not afraid of what you manufacture or what thing you make up it
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.600]  doesn't matter in the end I will defeat you humanity will defeat you because we
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.560]  don't have a choice I said I get to news and I'm ranting now the point is if you
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:26.760]  are not a prison planet dot TV member it's growing fast but I want to see it
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:34.880]  explode I want to see it absolutely totally explode because obviously just
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.440]  that hundred thousand or so that watch each day on there then of course we then
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.440]  put it on the YouTube channel a day later and then that gets millions of
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:46.920]  views a week together and then it spills out everywhere and we can't even
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:54.400]  count it that's before we even it's only in a Genesis orbit right now it's only
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.720]  in a new plot it's always a new level a new advancement more and more against
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:05.880]  the globalist that is the main strategic goal our goal is to break your
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:11.040]  conditioning and help you then break other people's conditioning not to make
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:16.000]  them believe or see what you see but to see that there is a wider world going on
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:23.480]  that there is manipulation taking place that is our goal and we are succeeding
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:28.200]  in history we've learned the secret individuals are powerful ideas are
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:36.200]  powerful good will trump evil if you step up against it it doesn't mean you're
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:43.040]  gonna win individually but in the end the idea will be victorious if you are
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:48.280]  committed let's say in my game of chicken with a new order they don't turn
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:54.640]  off and I plow head on into them they're a lot bigger than I am and that won't
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.600]  bring them completely down but it will create a new gouge in their face a new
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.520]  cut and that blood will run into their eye as they swerve more down the road
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:08.240]  and as more of us fly into them they're gonna go off the edge of the cliff so
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.120]  it's our job is just keep going in going in going in going in going in going in
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.000]  going in just keep going in against them never stopping and just let our
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:23.120]  strength and our spirit of victory pour out of us that's what we need to know I
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:26.360]  didn't get mad at Kurt Haskell who witnessed the government try to blow
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.440]  up that airline on Christmas day when he said we're all lost there's nothing we
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:35.560]  can do it's pure evil my god the whole government's terrorist that's that's
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:39.560]  what somebody comes to that point when they first realize the government at
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.440]  the top is terrorist is criminal is as evil as it gets because they all
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:46.760]  compete with each other it's evil at the top competing so you get the worst
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:52.640]  in there it's like an indie 500 of evil survival of the most evil survival of
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:58.800]  the fittest social Darwinism at the top the worst cancer takes over the body in
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:04.880]  this type of system I wasn't mad at him I saw that as a process that feeling of
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:09.400]  doom but then you realize you don't have anywhere to go you're gonna have to go
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:14.360]  ahead and fight and then that's empowering I mean when you realize as I
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:17.720]  showed the other night mainstream news articles New York Daily News you name it
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.480]  that didn't get any attention but I showed it in that special report on
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:24.400]  eugenics that we emailed out to everybody yesterday even if you're not a
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.560]  prison planet TV member where they took little black kids mainly and mentioned
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:35.480]  their names seven-year-olds people like that and took them and chained them down
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:40.960]  and fed them pesticides for a week till they died and the descriptions of the
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.400]  children begging please please it hurts and the pharma companies murdering them
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.600]  you know that's a heart some people like well that's impolite that's scary don't
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.560]  talk about it I don't like that show well they're still killing the kids right
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:57.640]  now I mean is somebody gonna help them we only know about a murdering the
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.360]  children in New York because CPS workers as wicked as they are finally we're like
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:08.600]  we're killing kids now see when you realize they got kids chained down
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.960]  murdering them stuff doesn't matter anymore you know what I mean your own
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:15.320]  family stops mattering they don't have any future if we don't beat these
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:19.600]  people you got to go all the way in against these folks and I'm gonna say
[01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:24.080]  it again to all you minions of this of the system who I know get called into
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.200]  meetings at the Pentagon and at Homeland Security and they say this is Alex Jones
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.800]  because I've talked to the police and seen the documents we've shown them
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:34.040]  you've heard the military calling and they say this is Alex Jones he's highly
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:38.200]  manipulative he has kernels of truth don't believe him don't listen to him
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:42.560]  how weird is the government that actually makes the military listen how
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.040]  many times have I seen that happen that's how scared they are okay of this
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.520]  show that all over government they say do not listen do not watch it do not

[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:14.040]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:18.360]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:23.640]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:27.960]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:31.440]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:36.680]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:42.360]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:47.680]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:58.480]  prison planet dot TV waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:00.760]  network
[02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:20.080]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.800]  Alex Jones we had a 25 minute extended interview at the end of the nightly
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.560]  news last night Dr. Sherry 10 penny where she agreed that the Gardasil
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:38.080]  situation has been manipulated on purpose to hurt little girls she's a
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.160]  medical doctor one of the leading experts big deal where to come out with
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:44.840]  that that's coming up I know that's the clips I told you to get I think that's
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.480]  coming up at the bottom of the hour we'll play a few minutes of that and get
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.040]  Chapman's take on it I haven't taken any phone calls today because I've been
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:56.240]  busy ranting and coming over news the stuff happening with the economy is
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:04.480]  just unbelievable it's all planned it's all been done by design and meanwhile
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.720]  also talks about this a boss the head of the Palestinian state the Palestinian
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:15.000]  authorities is called moves for statehood we shall not recognize a Jewish
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:21.480]  state Netanyahu says theater of the absurd and even if you don't agree with
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.440]  Netanyahu even if you're quote on the Palestinian side see I'm I see it's a
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:30.240]  master manipulation I don't have a dog in the fight see I'm I'm seeing the fake
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.360]  clash of civilizations just like the West throwing Gaddafi out partially and
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:39.800]  putting al-Qaeda in this is all part of destabilization because I know that the
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.680]  Western governments are manipulating this and I know the UN's manipulating this
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:47.200]  and I'm all for the Palestinians to have more freedom and land and to get
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.640]  land back that was taken you know in the last few wars but it's all it is
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.960]  theater of the absurd is Netanyahu says because Israel's an armed camp with
[02:01:56.960 --> 02:02:03.720]  nuclear weapons this is about legitimizing the UN right now while
[02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:09.280]  they're busy running around murdering people all over the world and so there's
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:13.920]  big clashes in the West Bank a lot of people are obsessed with this I get
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:17.800]  emails pouring in I talk about it pretty much every day and people say I've
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.720]  never heard you talk about it it's almost kind of like well why talk about it
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.200]  then because the more I talk about it the less I've supposedly talked about it
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:33.040]  and what do you even say about this I mean it is just gonna go on and on and
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:39.840]  on and on there's a hundred and eighty plus countries in the world and I'm
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:45.440]  into George Washington I'm into Ron Paul I'm into my country and my sovereignty
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.680]  and my low taxes and staying out of people's business and making really good
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:55.040]  products to sell the world and then we'll end up being like Switzerland or
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:00.160]  Japan or something I don't like paying for a military that is for the global
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:05.720]  corporations I'm tired of all the militarism I'm tired of it I'm done and
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:11.360]  quite frankly I get sick at my stomach when I see either side the mindless pure
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.120]  defenders of Israel and the people that absolutely want to destroy Israel and
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:18.440]  then the people that want to destroy Israel saying we don't want to destroy it
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:22.960]  Israel I've gone and seen the quotes I've actually seen them say it over and
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:28.400]  over again so what do you expect Israel to do that then gives the military
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:32.240]  industrial complex in Israel carte blanche to engage in whatever activity it
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:35.320]  wants just like every other government power corrupt absolute power corrupt
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:41.360]  absolutely Israel is incredibly corrupt but so is England so is the US so is
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:49.560]  China you know my point is is that I do not worship Israel the people that hate
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:54.360]  Israel worship it the people that love Israel worship it and I've just had
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:58.040]  enough I mean I was brought up going to the main line Christian churches
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:03.760]  Baptist and evangelical and just worship Israel 24-7 worship Israel
[02:04:03.760 --> 02:04:08.320]  worship Israel and then now I've grown up and I'm like I don't want to get into
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.240]  Israel I'm sick of it it's a distraction it's a globalist aversion and it's like
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.800]  well then you're defending Israel or then somebody else is you hate Israel and
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:24.040]  it's like no I don't have your fetish I'm sorry I I don't spend my waking hours
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:29.520]  just obsessed with it all day I'm not obsessed with Mexico or Saudi Arabia for
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:36.400]  that matter it's just it is it is ridiculous it is ridiculous I say cut
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:44.680]  off off RNA to everybody including Israel and just let all those groups just
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:48.920]  have it out with each other I mean hell nuclear bomb going off isn't as bad as
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:55.800]  a Chernobyl or a thing like they've had out in out in Fukushima that's thousands
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:59.280]  of atomic bombs right there so let them go and have a nuclear war over there just
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:04.920]  keep us out of it hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have

[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:08.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:12.360]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:16.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:21.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.120]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:29.640]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:37.480]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:41.560]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:44.280]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:05.960]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:13.600]  because there's a war on for your mind well I can't think of a better time to
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.880]  have Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster on with us
[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:22.040]  golden silver are plunging this is something Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said
[02:08:22.040 --> 02:08:26.040]  about six months ago on the show you can dig it up he said Alex there's a chance
[02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:32.480]  they get implode markets when the euro starts going under and that the US
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:36.880]  treasury bonds are going to go way up and then golden silver will plunge for a
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:44.440]  time as people desperately try to prop up the dollar and he sure called it but
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.000]  this has happened before but you look at the 12-year graph it just keeps
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.160]  coming up because of global currency devaluation this is obviously going to
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.960]  terrify a lot of people but I bought silver at $5 an ounce and gold at 260
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:05.680]  an ounce and I never sold it when it hit 1900 or when silver hit right at 50 and
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.240]  I'm not going to sell it now and I'm not going to sell the silver and gold about a
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.840]  few months ago few times a year I buy some because I've got it as an
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.880]  emergency backup for dying currencies I don't have it as an investment even
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:20.800]  though in the last decade it's been the best overall performing investment he
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:26.720]  barons admits that CNBC admits that and so we're going to get Bob Chapman's take
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:30.200]  on gold and silver the global markets what's happening in the stock market
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:34.800]  right now that I want to hit a plethora of other news items and issues like
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.320]  Michael Moore saying you know the rich better raise taxes or it's going to get
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.480]  violent what he means is Warren Buffett who's exempt from taxes wants the middle
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:50.520]  classes money in banker bailout see that's a translation for you of what the
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:57.000]  man bear pig follower is doing but Bob Chapman give us in layman's terms what's
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:00.480]  happening with gold and silver right now
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:08.880]  well first of all you have still ongoing troubles in Europe the Federys
[02:10:08.880 --> 02:10:13.920]  they've had to come up with $500 billion in swap they were accompanied by the
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:19.440]  Bank of Japan the Bank of England in the Swiss National Bank because in the
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:29.360]  United States they had about perhaps $1.5 trillion invested in bank paper and
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:36.560]  other paper in Europe and they pulled about two-thirds of it and that left the
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:43.280]  paper that is usually rolled over without anybody to sell it to and so the
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:50.440]  banks were in terrible liquidity shape and so what happened was that they come
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:53.840]  up with this money which they created created out of thin air and they're
[02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:58.240]  going to give it to the banks to stay in business it's a same old same old it's
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:02.880]  the same thing they did in the United States earlier and probably we'll have
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:10.080]  to do again but it's very unsettled air your commentary about what Paul Craig
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:16.600]  Roberts had to say was excellent yes he did say that and he was right but I
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:23.400]  think this market is being forced the dollar to the upside and so it won't
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:35.800]  crash through 71 18 and on the USDX excuse me and you are getting margin
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:40.920]  selling particularly in commodities and I think most of that happened over the
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:47.200]  two days before and do you are getting some margin selling affecting gold and
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:54.280]  silver and the shares but there's not enough to even consider I mean what
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:59.200]  you're seeing in gold and silver and the shares and all out attack by the
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:05.920]  United States government I just writing a piece for tomorrow's publication and
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:13.240]  the first line for the golden silver section is Friday into the week to
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:20.640]  remember we haven't seen this kind of action since October the 19th 1987 when
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:28.760]  the Fed and the US Treasury rigged the market because it was illegal that but
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:35.480]  anyway it will a tool pass it'll probably be over oh maybe Tuesday Wednesday and
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:40.040]  that'll be it it'll turn around and go right back up again we had a rally in
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:47.360]  the Dow was up 72 points not too long ago it's up 30 now they're trying to keep
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:57.880]  the market parallel but under underneath this Wall Street has in general along
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:06.760]  with the banks demanded that the Fed do this QE 3 type of thing an operation
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:13.880]  twist is that but it isn't what it is is going in and buying long-term paper these
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:21.040]  the notes and bonds of 5 7 10 and 30 years but it pressures banks to put out
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:30.880]  more money so it creates a QE 3 that's true and they want the banks to draw on
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.760]  the 2 trillion dollars that they have sitting at the Fed well that was my
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:38.680]  next question I had a caller two days ago then and finish your point that
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:41.640]  answered before I forget I want to ask this question the guys said look I've
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:45.760]  been in bond trading for a long time but this is crazy the dollars devalued
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:53.000]  everything's falling apart but then why why are you know the the bond sales up
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.520]  while the yield goes down he said ask Bob what's going on with this crazy bond
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:03.400]  market well it's the Fed is in the market with money they created out of thin air
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.240]  and I know that because all of the money that they could have rolled the
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:14.600]  Treasury paper since the middle of June until now has all been rolled and they
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:19.160]  don't have any cash to do that so they got to create it and so they're going in
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:24.720]  the bond market now they're doing two things they're forcing the yield down by
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.520]  buying the bonds making them go up on the other hand they're trying to maintain
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:43.800]  the low yields on the bills particularly and they are 15 30 60 90 120 360 and then
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.440]  you get two-year paper and they're trying to keep them sacrosanct so to
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:54.920]  speak and so that is what this operation twist is all about it's not going to
[02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:03.560]  work we're looking at three places this is to get the 30-year mortgage down from
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:12.440]  4% to 3% and they do that by making the bond the 10-year note go up and the
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  yield goes down the yield last time I started here was about 171 or 1 1.72
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:26.720]  percent which is outrageous it's so low because it may that's why they're doing
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:34.160]  it the 3.8 million homes and we're talking about a total of 8 to 11 million
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:40.440]  over the next four years and they think because more people qualify that lots of
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:45.000]  people are going to run out and buy homes it's not going to happen they also
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.120]  hope that building will rise putting more people to work but as you know
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:55.400]  Copper's down which which isn't you know doing with commodities overall but it
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:00.280]  does show that that's a belief that China is is going to start slowing and I
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:04.240]  want to get your take on what that means but the stock market is up 21 points
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:09.240]  right now after dropping at the open earlier global stocks in a bear market
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:15.080]  and the US is probably next is what CNBC is saying so when does the seesaw go
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:19.200]  back the other way because recently in the last few years it goes back within
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:23.880]  just a few weeks and in your gut which you're great at estimating how much
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.080]  higher will gold and silver go will it will it immediately retrace its losses
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:32.880]  or what's going to happen well in the market I think it'll only take three to
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.920]  five days because I think the Federal Reserve is going to make some noises
[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:43.320]  about some type of quantitative quantitative easing the last thing
[02:16:43.320 --> 02:16:46.800]  they want is the stock market plunging and if he doesn't come out and say
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:52.040]  something it'll probably drop another 1500 to 2000 points and they need that
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:55.160]  like they need a hole in the head so when does all start going back up two
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:00.480]  weeks from now no I think we may be seeing the short-covering turn in here
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:06.840]  over the last two hours in the regular stock market which is the December
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.280]  trading months in gold and silver because spot is in silver and gold have
[02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:19.000]  already closed and I expect moderation perhaps lower prices option
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.360]  expiration for gold and silver is on Tuesday it's a non-event is this time
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.600]  because everybody in the long sides are wiped out again for the third time in
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:36.800]  about four weeks okay what about JP Morgan saying that they see $2,500 on
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:41.080]  the low end by December they're saying I think that's what was that some type of
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:44.600]  sucker punch before they manipulated it down or do you still think that's where
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:52.120]  it's going well I think that it's going and they're serious about it and this
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:57.520]  is probably the last correction and quite frankly I hope it is too what we
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:04.480]  had maybe two people email us regarding the market are they getting used to these
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:09.000]  up-and-downs like jackrabbits and so they're not concerned about it because
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.400]  the market fundamentals of inflation a few brokers and they tell me the same
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.200]  thing so people understand it's them it's the market fundamentals are still
[02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:20.360]  there of a devalued currency so commodities are going to go up that's
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:25.960]  right and I promise you very shortly as we head toward the end of the month and
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:29.880]  I get some more money I'm going to be buying again I do it every month well I
[02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:33.040]  know I'm going to continue to do it I know what Ted Anderson is doing he's
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:37.040]  buying in the market with both hands right now as much silver and gold as he
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.840]  can because Ted knows it's going to go back up according to the laws of
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:46.520]  finance I don't see anything they could do to keep it down like this unless he
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:53.320]  goes into a full depression now but then the currency still devalued so one way
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:56.920]  or another gold and silver's got to go up unless they just create a whole new
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:06.120]  monetary system you Alex you're absolutely correct perfect and that's
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:11.040]  where we head and so all you people who have money to buy more or want to make
[02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.160]  initial buys and gold and silver coins and bullion or even shares you go right
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:19.560]  ahead and do that yeah well I am gonna go ahead and I'm gonna do I'm gonna buy
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:23.240]  today but I already made some calls this morning to Ted when I noticed is
[02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:28.960]  they're saying silver's down at 30 and gold's dropped a bunch but I'm Ted's out
[02:19:28.960 --> 02:19:32.160]  there looking around he's not able to get it at that price so it looks like
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.080]  it's again more of a paper mirage and I think it's losing its impetus to the
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:45.160]  downside like it has three times not to and not too long past my point is you
[02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:49.280]  can't really get silver right now at $30 an ounce even though the ticker says it
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.600]  is stay there the paper market versus reality more with Bob Chapman straight

[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:12.520]  back tonight 7 o'clock hardest working man in radio hardest working
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:17.160]  individual in the info war period no one can deny it because we know how great
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.240]  the stakes are now I want to get into a host of issues play a short three minute
[02:25:21.240 --> 02:25:24.920]  clip of dr. sherry 10 penny on vaccines get bob
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:27.960]  Chapman's take on that I want to play this Michael Moore clip get a quick
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:31.320]  report from Darren McBreen and Aaron Dykes on the ground
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:34.920]  for this total federalization martial law takeover drill
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:40.120]  called Mountain Guardian going on in Denver out there by Northcom
[02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:43.880]  our military governorship but going back to Bob Chapman
[02:25:43.880 --> 02:25:47.800]  I noticed Fannie Mae's been cited for failing to stop robo signing
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:52.040]  but the federal government is basically citing itself
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:56.760]  with a slap on the wrist for committing basically financial murder
[02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:00.280]  the state attorney generals are trying to change laws or wave ones
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:05.400]  to allow them to take houses they don't own how long can this kleptocracy go
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:09.400]  bob because the population is really starting to wake up I mean it's just
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:14.680]  it's exponential that's a hard call and we've just
[02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:20.280]  discussed that many times on the program and I don't have an answer for that
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:24.040]  you never know what the trigger is I always think it's an empty belly
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:29.160]  and that has been true from time to time I just don't know but
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:34.360]  you know the longer it takes the more inroads government's going to make and
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:39.160]  also control it but on the other hand it's going to give us more time
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:42.440]  to be able to inform more people throughout the world
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.080]  and it's not only in America but it's out there throughout the world
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:52.120]  we're inundated with subscribers from all over the world it's incredible
[02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:55.720]  and we just had like eight of them this morning
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:27:00.200]  just as an example and that's a lot you know those things didn't happen
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:04.360]  before so everybody out there is seeking information
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:09.000]  and so there's a good and bad side to it as far as the government's citing
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:13.480]  itself and I know what was going on and you know I heart back eight years when
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:16.520]  I wrote the article that Fannie and Freddie are broke they're
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:19.960]  going to be taken over by the government and the needless to say
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.960]  everybody laughed at me and of course it came true unfortunately well you also
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:28.760]  said that you're um go ahead but the important thing Alex
[02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:36.760]  is that I said that the intent is going to be that government eventually
[02:27:36.760 --> 02:27:41.880]  will own all housing the nationalization of housing and that's what
[02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:48.760]  they're after here they don't care about eight or ten million empty houses
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:51.720]  they're going to control them well they've now said they're not going to sell
[02:27:51.720 --> 02:27:57.240]  many houses at three percent uh 30 year fixed mortgages
[02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:00.600]  the people just don't have the money there's too many people unemployed
[02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.440]  and it's getting worse not better and that was the plan all along when they
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:07.640]  ordered Bill Clinton ordered them to start giving these loans out
[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:11.160]  they knew exactly what they were doing and then the banks go and solve it and
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.000]  they get nationalized just like General Motors and General Motors moves its
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.800]  plants overseas well here they just basically nationalize it and now
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:22.520]  they're talking about letting millions people stay in their houses
[02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.800]  under federal control and they've had federal courts rule that when you're in
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:29.640]  federal housing you have no rights they can come in your house without warrants
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:34.920]  the road to total domestication is getting a lot deeper you also predicted
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:40.040]  three years ago that the euro would implode but that something even nastier
[02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:43.560]  would come out of it now they've said global government private
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:46.920]  financial union over europe holding europe hostage

[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:16.440]  that the bankers who have purchased most of the

[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:25.480]  and they think that legislation will be passed
[02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:29.640]  for this new stability forum which will
[02:29:29.640 --> 02:29:36.840]  uh call upon members to buy bonds and that money will be taken
[02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:44.120]  to subsidize the six ailing insolvent country and so they expected to go on

[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:21.400]  i don't believe all right mom i got a host of other news items i want to throw
[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:24.600]  at you i've got a video clip of my interview with dr sherry
[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:27.880]  tenpenny like a 25 minute interview but as jaren
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:33.800]  says this is just her two cents uh on the fact uh get it it's a pun
[02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:37.320]  tenpenny uh on the fact that this Gardasil forced
[02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:40.840]  inoculation they're trying in california he's being done by design
[02:33:40.840 --> 02:33:43.720]  that they've altered the vaccine to actually
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.680]  cause autoimmune disease not wouldn't be the first time these companies have
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:50.520]  been caught doing it in fact i'm going to play a clip tonight again
[02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:54.280]  on the tv show of one of the top merc developers of vaccines admitting they
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:57.160]  put leukemia virus and other things and a whole bunch of
[02:33:57.160 --> 02:34:00.120]  different vaccines so that's coming up this evening in four wars
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:03.880]  nightly news but i wanted you to finish up briefly
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:07.880]  with how this is going to go in europe because three years ago
[02:34:07.880 --> 02:34:12.120]  you you said you watch the euro's going to break up
[02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:15.480]  and on deeper research you've got a lot of globalists have said the euro was
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:19.560]  set up as a receivership arm to destroy sovereignty not to be part of a union
[02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:22.920]  and then to hand it over to a private corporate union
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.240]  and we've seen this now in country after country so how do you see this ending
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:30.920]  because the bankers will always take more more more more more because they've
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:33.560]  bought off the government and own the whore media
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:38.040]  the dominant dinosaur uh zombie media just like zombie banks
[02:34:38.040 --> 02:34:43.000]  it you know propped up and force fed by the way do gave me a email last night
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.680]  with the document i forgot to get this to watson an article out
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.520]  homeland security has now announced they're going to put tv's in our cars
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:55.240]  and bombard us with forced messages that is so huge i that just popped in my head
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:59.080]  that i have that yes since yesterday i've not given it to
[02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:01.800]  or watson didn't see it in the email we've got to get an article out on that
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:05.400]  right now my head is just spinning the amount of info coming in right now ladies
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:09.880]  and gentlemen uh but i mean how long can this go on bob
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:13.400]  it could go on quite a long time and i'll tell you why
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:19.880]  uh if the uh bundesdag uh passes the approval
[02:35:19.880 --> 02:35:27.560]  to allow this financial stability group uh to take care of the problems of the
[02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:31.880]  ailing members then what they can do is issue bonds
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:37.000]  and they can extend this whole thing as long as
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:43.640]  there are bias for the bonds within the eurozone group of 17 or the uh EU group
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:50.040]  of 27 in total and so if they get that uh ability
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:56.840]  what this does is the countries are forced to participate in the bond
[02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:00.520]  offerings unless they're recipients of the subsidy
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:04.840]  and that effectively takes away their sovereignty
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:08.920]  because the national banks will take like the
[02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:13.400]  bundesbank it won't have any more control
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:18.680]  and and next what they'll do through that agency of stability
[02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:24.680]  they will then demand that the internal finances
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:29.640]  of each state be run by this stability facility
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.560]  and so they want to take the sovereignty away
[02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:37.160]  from all of the countries the ability to make their own budget
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:44.040]  budgets they have their their own uh spending uh they will be told what they
[02:36:44.040 --> 02:36:48.520]  can do and what they can't do and it will all be centralized in
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.160]  this stability group and this is what mrs.
[02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:55.960]  berkel is pushing for you know she's from the former eastern Germany
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:02.520]  mecklenburg west pomerania and that was a hive of pro-communist
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:06.200]  pro-soviet activity i know i used to spy on them
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:10.760]  and uh and so how she ever got into the cd du cdu
[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:14.280]  i'll never know she's certainly not middle of the road by
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:17.400]  any stretch of the well look at who the belterberg group puts in as the head of
[02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:21.560]  the euro admitted communist von rumpi the whole lot of them
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:24.440]  that's through the backers put in is communist
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.240]  because they want all the money transferred to themselves there's no
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:30.200]  end to this tyranny and we've got to deal with it
[02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:34.760]  now um i want to play a clip dealing with vaccines with dr sherry tenpenny
[02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:37.800]  just an excerpt of our interview we'll be back in about three minutes
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:41.240]  to get bob chatman's take on this then we're going to look at a couple other
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:44.760]  big issues that we're facing dealing with eugenics then we're going to
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:48.360]  pop in from erin dykes and during the green on the ground for the urban
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  warfare martial law takeover drill in denver but here's a clip from infill
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.960]  wars nightly news last night
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:03.640]  there are so many tv shows movies about mega death
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:08.520]  billions dead not a question of vif but when you've got to get the shot
[02:38:08.520 --> 02:38:11.480]  and when you learn that this vaccine industry is a hundred billion dollar
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:15.640]  industry a year or more you really see that this is product placement
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.640]  propaganda placement and that that's the race in the hole is just scaring
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:24.760]  the daylights out of people absolutely and the the vision statement of the
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.520]  pharmaceutical industry which i learned this from a pharmaceutical insider
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:32.040]  said that the vision statement of the entire industry is to have every single
[02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:35.720]  human on the planet on a minimum of two
[02:38:35.720 --> 02:38:39.080]  daily pharmaceutical drugs for their entire life
[02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.520]  well how better to do that than to start with young children
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:46.280]  and making them terribly sick and have all sorts of things from asthma
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:50.040]  allergies eczema adhd adhd that you can't really connect
[02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:53.480]  somebody told me that there was a line from that movie contagion that said
[02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:56.760]  you know we need to make this vaccine because of 10 years from now
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.680]  um we it's causing autism nobody will be able to connect the dots
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:03.880]  and that's exactly what they're setting up they want everybody sick because that
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:08.040]  promotes their widgets have you found the eugenics angle in
[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:12.200]  your research i have and i think that it's uh
[02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:15.880]  you know what a lot of people say and i would have to agree that
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:19.640]  when you know world war two was over everybody just traded in their uniforms
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:23.480]  for white coats and and uh and business suits
[02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:27.640]  we'd nothing changed it was life things just went on as as usual
[02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:31.240]  and i do believe that there is definitely a sinister side and the problem
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:36.360]  that bothers me the most alex is what's wrong with with the 800 000
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.880]  physicians in this country that they just march to the tomb of the drug
[02:39:39.880 --> 02:39:42.440]  companies that they're not willing to look at any of this
[02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.640]  information or very little of it they're not they don't know what's coming
[02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:49.000]  through that needle and being injected into adults and children and they just
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.680]  absolutely stand by it and take people like me and you and other people who
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:55.720]  are exposing the truth and tell colleagues and other
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:58.920]  physicians say you're just you're just you're just saying all the wrong
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:02.440]  things it's just really i'll tell you why they've been following the system so
[02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:06.840]  long they don't want to admit they were conned and were wrong
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:11.560]  and so they're now committed to it and i think they deceive us by even calling
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:16.280]  these vaccines these are more nanotech
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:20.200]  re-engineered viruses i mean now they've got the new classes coming out that
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:23.160]  re-engineer the brain and attack neurons that would
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.200]  uptake endorphins that you know the fun facts
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:31.960]  exactly they're saying no don't be depressed anymore i mean this is
[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:36.040]  this is really buck roger's type re-engineering of society and they
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:39.720]  just call it vaccines and they think well this is like the polio vaccine
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.080]  we're saving people yeah saving them with hundreds of millions
[02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:46.600]  exposed to cancer viruses well think about all of these girls that we were
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:50.120]  talking about just a few minutes ago that would get these injections of
[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:53.080]  Gardasil and it could be any of the there's now
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:57.160]  kids now get 40 doses of 16 different vaccines by the time they
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:00.280]  start kindergarten and one of the things that people have to realize when
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:03.160]  they're listening to this and it's school season school just started and
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:05.960]  across the country they've been telling people that parents no
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:09.160]  shots no school well my answer to that is no
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:13.000]  shots no school not true every state except west
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.320]  virginian mississippi have either a philosophical exemption or a
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:20.120]  medical exemption for you to opt out of your children being
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:23.560]  inoculated with all of these things so there
[02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:27.080]  there are a lot of ways that you could stop it but every one of these vaccines
[02:41:27.080 --> 02:41:30.760]  all have horrible potential side effects there is
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:34.680]  nothing that can come through a needle and to try to keep you healthy
[02:41:34.680 --> 02:41:38.040]  that that you can't do for yourself just by your own
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.200]  diet exercise vitamin d vitamin c and all those things well doc that's another
[02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:46.280]  example of the hoax exactly they continue to say it's the
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:48.600]  law you've got to take it and that's what's so
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:52.360]  wonderful about peri being caught we called him it came out he didn't have
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:55.960]  the authority it wasn't the law and now he has to apologize and all the other
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:41:59.880]  candidates are against him
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:04.760]  okay there was an excerpt of the hour long nightly news some nights it's two
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:07.800]  hours it'll always be at least 30 minutes we've never done
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:11.640]  only a 30 minute show and as i beta tested and hone it we're gonna end up
[02:42:11.640 --> 02:42:14.840]  with a 30 minute show every night that then goes into a special report for
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.440]  another 30 so the cable systems that want an hour long show can get it
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:21.720]  or if you want a 30 minute show you can get it and then we're gonna expand it
[02:42:21.720 --> 02:42:24.200]  over time into a two three four hour show
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:29.080]  and and other news transmissions here out of our offices we're even
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.280]  looking at doing a comedy show and a lot more
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:36.120]  dealing with satire going back to bob Chapman bob
[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:38.520]  what do you think of what sherry tim pinning was saying i mean she's a main
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:42.760]  line medical doctor 10 years ago five years ago i bring up eugenics she
[02:42:42.760 --> 02:42:47.960]  wouldn't go there in the full interview she was talking she volunteered
[02:42:47.960 --> 02:42:51.400]  that this has been clearly purposefully bound
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:56.040]  to the adjuvant so that it attacks and causes an autoimmune response
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:59.800]  well that's what garden still has been doing in its five-year history
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.080]  so it's designed to do that and here's sherry tim pinning agreeing
[02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:06.280]  i mean these people are monsters and now in california it's on the governor's
[02:43:06.280 --> 02:43:09.480]  desk to shoot the kids up without parental consent
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:17.000]  i mean this is getting to be war here and it is war and i read about that
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.560]  latter statement that you just made i was appalled
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:25.240]  i mean i couldn't believe it uh giving children
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:32.040]  shots without telling their parents i mean it shows you how far afield
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:36.680]  these nincompoops to call themselves uh politicians
[02:43:36.680 --> 02:43:42.680]  uh it just they're out of sight well a nincompoop though what do you want
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:45.160]  well lord montan called them nincompoops the other day
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:47.800]  a nincompoop i really disagree with you bob but
[02:43:47.800 --> 02:43:51.800]  but a nincompoop is an idiot these are cold-blooded psychopathic killers but
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:54.600]  are are are you saying they're nincompoops because
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:59.240]  they think they're going to get away with it yes that's what i mean
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.680]  now that you've given me an exit no but i mean you've been around these folks i
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:08.840]  mean what horrible i mean i carry this stuff in my health section
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.160]  and not very many newsletters that aren't devoted to health have a health
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:16.760]  section but i haven't had one from the very beginning
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:19.880]  i haven't had shots for anything since i was in the army
[02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:25.400]  and uh uh and you know we do vitamins minerals and herbs and have for 48 years
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:30.840]  and it probably is one of the reasons why i'm as healthy and able to do the
[02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:34.840]  job load that i do and so i'm very interested in health
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:40.120]  but they are poisoning us they are especially
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:44.840]  honing in on poisoning our children so that they will become
[02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.600]  users of our medicine
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:54.440]  bob in the final segment coming up i want to get to this incredible article
[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:58.520]  uh dealing with cameron going to the un and the un agreeing
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:01.800]  that they want to start quote more humanitarian invasions
[02:45:01.800 --> 02:45:06.520]  where they finance the rebels and then come in and bombard and call it peace
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:10.360]  and that dovetails with un security council announces new green
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:13.960]  helmets peacekeepers that will invade areas that aren't
[02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:17.720]  taking care of the earth and now they've begun the new york times basically
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:20.760]  endorses it armed troops burned down homes killed
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.040]  children to evict Ugandans in name of global warming
[02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:28.280]  they're forcing them through a world bank operation off the hereditary land
[02:45:28.280 --> 02:45:33.160]  to plant trees on it for carbon offsets and the liberals are hailing this they
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.640]  have shot and burned the children up and they're actually hailing it so
[02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:41.880]  a new level in psychopathic behavior from the trendy nazis
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:45.400]  now before we get to that with bob Chapman i want to bring up and then get
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:48.440]  bob's take on it erin dykes and a comment from darin
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.280]  mcbreen we barely had a chance to talk to you earlier they're in denver
[02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:57.400]  for this uh forest guardian i'm talking about the mass murder sorry
[02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:02.040]  mountain guardian uh situation i know you guys have been to some more drills
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:04.440]  now you've been a swat team takeovers of schools
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:08.040]  all federally directed erin what have you witnessed in the last two hours
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:12.760]  alex we just had major updates on a part of the press release where they admit
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:17.400]  they're using the sports stadium here out of breath we just been checking with
[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:21.320]  sources they're using the sports stadium to test
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:26.280]  to process they and then we confirm with the source at the stadium
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:31.080]  that although they won't let us in there's been school buses with teachers
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:35.320]  of children so that's your female processor right there
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:39.400]  well that goes back to a program schools wow i hear out of breath catch your
[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:42.040]  breath for a minute erin but but you got to get up on a tall
[02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:45.080]  building um uh that will let you run a helicopter right now during one of
[02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:48.440]  these drills you've got to get it because that's what they did in chicago but
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.120]  wouldn't let do and douglas into that and i'm sick of it
[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:56.520]  and that's usually the real drill and they practice at these
[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:59.640]  whenever there's an emergency in fact in fact i'm going to get a hold of
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:02.360]  watts in the washington post number five years ago reported
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:05.640]  that in emergencies they're going to take your kids away from you take them to
[02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:08.360]  sports stadiums till you agree to come turn your guns in
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:11.720]  to get them that's how they get you in the people they want in custody
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:14.760]  they grab your kids out of the school and make you come to get them and then
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:19.480]  you're never seen again you've confirmed tell us the sources if you can
[02:47:19.480 --> 02:47:22.280]  obviously we knew when they wouldn't let media in the sports stadium
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:26.680]  exactly what's happening the first source is the actual news advisory which
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:31.320]  gives the layout of the entire exercise on the bottom paragraph of page one
[02:47:31.320 --> 02:47:35.960]  it talks about the use of Catholic Charities and the sports authority field
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:40.120]  at mile high stadium which has been renamed from in besco to sports authority
[02:47:40.120 --> 02:47:44.280]  uh to test student teacher processing activities
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:48.040]  a little code word of theirs meanwhile we were getting to run around at the
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.000]  stadium but one of the employees took this off that
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.360]  yes the buses were coming in and no press was allowed they're only allowed in
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:57.480]  the parking lot more than i don't know a quarter mile
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:00.520]  we're going to check the alex jones channel at youtube curtain emmo's
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:04.920]  updating as we go uh but we first just did a major update
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:10.600]  yeah well we first just learned about this in 2000 pre-911 we got photos sent
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:15.400]  by listeners we called the school it was in the ozarks on the arkansas
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:19.400]  oklahoma border no arkansas missouri border we've got articles on info wars
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.560]  i've got a poem there from 10 years ago or more than 10 now almost 11
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:27.240]  and and in that they were practicing taking kids away from their families
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:31.000]  to a FEMA center so you're saying that is indeed going on and you have their
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.960]  press release were you able to get footage of the vehicles driving in
[02:48:35.960 --> 02:48:39.880]  well this is there now and we're on our way like uh you're uh Aaron might have
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.640]  just told you we've just been tipped off that their school bus is loaded with
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:46.760]  children oh my god it's driven in on the other side so we're
[02:48:46.760 --> 02:48:50.360]  going to go over there real quick yeah get in the car get in the car drive while
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.200]  we talk get in the car okay drive while we talk yeah get over
[02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:58.920]  there so you just got we've also been told that residents
[02:48:58.920 --> 02:49:01.880]  in the area they've been warned to expect loud noises
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:05.240]  explosions and smoke we've witnessed all three
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:09.640]  we're also seeing a huge uh you know there's a military president
[02:49:09.640 --> 02:49:13.720]  and um right now they're driving the other side and see if we can catch the
[02:49:13.720 --> 02:49:18.520]  school buses entering the stadium yeah what this is is learned helplessness
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:21.880]  they they train the children to go with the men in black uniforms and
[02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:25.000]  disappear and they admit I remember Mark Kornke talking
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.120]  about this 15 years ago and I halfway didn't believe it
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:31.080]  that they'll take you to a sports stadium and make your parents come
[02:49:31.080 --> 02:49:35.000]  and then they arrest you there and then sure enough it was confirmed later
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:41.080]  I mean this government is so diabolical that they've got the preachers training
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:44.600]  to tell people to go to FEMA camps guys you get me no one here
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.640]  we feel lucky that we got tipped off because I'm telling you they
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:50.520]  they really tried to keep us from entering the stadium in fact they wanted
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.080]  this you know far from the interest is and um we're surprised that the press
[02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:59.640]  was here and uh we haven't seen any other media in this area so
[02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:03.720]  they're really keeping it hush hush yeah let me guess because this is always an
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:06.440]  exercise in distractions they were probably telling you oh go to this
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:11.000]  event or go to this train event or go here just don't go to the sports stadium
[02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.960]  obviously remember I told you before you flew out yesterday I said
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.040]  sports stadium sports stadium I said if you have to split up
[02:50:18.040 --> 02:50:21.720]  and have somebody stake out that sports stadium and I meant to tell Aaron before
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:23.880]  he ran out to get the telephoto video camera
[02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:27.960]  you guys are there any skyscrapers you can get in to shoot video off the roof
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:31.240]  into there well you know there's a lot of high
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:35.480]  area high ground around this uh stadium that we'll we'll definitely try to do
[02:50:35.480 --> 02:50:40.200]  they're not gonna want you to see this because after the kids go in you watch
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:43.720]  they're gonna have simulations of parents arriving and they're gonna be arrested
[02:50:43.720 --> 02:50:46.920]  oh we may actually have them like I shouldn't be talking about it they may
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:49.560]  cancel that part of the drill we've got to get this key evidence
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:52.520]  of course I've already video taped it before with the Marines doing it nobody
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:55.240]  seems to care all right stay there ladies and gentlemen
[02:50:55.240 --> 02:50:58.600]  I'm gonna get Bob Chapman's take on this we may go into overdrive regardless

[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:26.920]  with the sunday news show we like to be on at least six days a week to cover
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:30.040]  everything that's happening when you really wake up is when you go to an
[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:34.200]  urban warfare drill and you witness the people plan the part of americans with
[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:37.800]  families being broken up and firearms being confiscated and
[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:41.000]  probes asking where'd you get the firearms and they say i got it from
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.680]  here i'm from san francisco then you go back to your hotel room
[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:48.760]  cnn's there with you and they're reporting their training for fighting in
[02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:55.640]  bosnia you're like whoa this is creepy uh so yes they are and i've got kurt back
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:54:59.720]  there pulling the washington post and stuff they do have plans just like the
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.520]  soviets did to take your kids to a camp then make you come turn yourself in
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:07.400]  you think you're going to pick them up and they run you through a list and then
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.480]  boom you get loaded on a truck and rolled out to the uh
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:14.920]  gulag whatever the case is and the federal government now admits they've
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:19.080]  made list of americans for a roundup well you know what you do with soviets when
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:22.120]  they come all right i mean i'm sorry it's getting to this
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:25.080]  point ladies and gentlemen we're trying to peacefully fix things but you don't
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:27.800]  have to go into ditch and be shot in the back of the head by the feds
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:30.520]  who are training by the way and all these drills to take on
[02:55:30.520 --> 02:55:33.880]  uh quote disgruntled veterans i want to go back to erin who i can hear shooting
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:36.040]  report in the background so i won't go to him quite yet
[02:55:36.040 --> 02:55:39.000]  we're going a little bit of overdrive with him bob Chapman what's your view on
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:43.320]  what you're hearing right now well it's something i expected
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:46.680]  40 years ago it took a long time to get here
[02:55:46.680 --> 02:55:52.440]  i'm like you i'm very unhappy that uh it's happened but uh
[02:55:52.440 --> 02:55:55.880]  we can't stop what's going on with the government
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:55:59.800]  unless we can get people in congress that will stop them
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:03.320]  and whether that'll happen or not remains to be seen
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:07.800]  but uh yes they want to control everybody and they certainly want to get
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.800]  guns away from people and they do want to
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:16.680]  train and control impressionable young people
[02:56:16.680 --> 02:56:20.120]  these kids uh i coach kids for 35 years
[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:26.680]  i know how it works uh how children react to things and how trusting
[02:56:26.680 --> 02:56:32.600]  and two are really they are as children and they're easy marks for these people
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.360]  um now bob i want to hold you over for five minutes and the internet only
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:39.000]  overdrives we can get a more of a report from erin and your
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:43.240]  your comment on it but let's not forget the emergency
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.120]  centers establishment act that says oh it's community areas during collapse but
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:51.800]  also the bad guys the political dissidents will have to be separated and
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:55.560]  put in a in a in a chained area but you're lucky to be allowed into the camp
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:57.960]  during the banker uh implosion this is all just
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:01.400]  acclimating locals about people being taken to camps oh it's just
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:04.600]  children for now it's all part of drilling this
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:08.280]  and finding out who on the police departments says something or is aware
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:12.040]  of what's going on this is all multifaceted so the feds can
[02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:15.320]  probe the enemy as they see us the american people this is a federal
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:17.400]  government that works for foreign banks
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:20.440]  erin it's key in your report because people are watching these big time to
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:24.120]  point out the emergency centers establishment act the clergy response
[02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:27.320]  teams this all dovetails in with everything else
[02:57:27.320 --> 02:57:31.800]  what are you now seeing erin dykes alex this thing is a labyrinth but we finally
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:37.160]  got to the southeast tunnel entrance and we have seen the safety officer vehicle
[02:57:37.160 --> 02:57:41.960]  pretend republic schools and we are looking at a bus mark special it's not
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:44.840]  a yellow school bus but it's a kind of city bus
[02:57:44.840 --> 02:57:47.560]  and it's that special it's parked in the southeast tunnel
[02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:50.760]  we don't know how many other buses are in there uh there's also a crowd of
[02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:54.680]  people buying t-shirts or something uh but we've been confronted by some of
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:58.440]  the security although we haven't left yet alex well you just tell them i mean
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:01.000]  they told you to leave here in america trying to show what they're doing with

[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:43.640]  i'm really glad the city's unlocked down yeah that that's what i was reading
[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:47.240]  they've used this basically to lock down the city correct
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:50.680]  uh large parts of downtown are completely blocked off yeah
[03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:53.560]  although obviously there's still activity going on yeah they're using the
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:56.440]  threat of fake terror to set up martial law in america and this is all
[03:01:56.440 --> 03:01:59.880]  acclimation let me talk to mcbrain real quick and get his take on this
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:03.160]  yeah uh mr big green
[03:02:04.520 --> 03:02:07.560]  this is darin all right darin we've only got a minute or two left i want to get
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:11.720]  bob to pop in with the final word but what's your take on what you're seeing
[03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:15.320]  you know it's it's even crazier than i was expected that we're being told that
[03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:19.640]  this drill is something bigger on the scale of 9 11 they said it was even
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.480]  bigger what authorities are referring to that the word i hear alex is
[03:02:23.480 --> 03:02:26.440]  catastrophic it's what they're drilling for
[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:30.040]  so um we're just trying to get a a better look inside
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.600]  we're told that a another school bus is on the way so erin and i are gonna
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:37.880]  try to uh talk to the authorities here i think we found someone to talk to and
[03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:41.160]  try to bring back some footage okay great yeah that's why we that's why i
[03:02:41.160 --> 03:02:44.280]  sent you because i've learned the biggest drills
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.440]  are in denver and every time i've missed it so that's why i heard another
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:51.880]  denver drill that they weren't really making a big deal out of i said we've
[03:02:51.880 --> 03:02:54.280]  got to get there so we're catching some key intel
[03:02:54.280 --> 03:02:57.880]  we'll obviously have more tonight uh seven o'clock and you guys are

[03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:22.600]  bob in closing i mentioned armed troops burned down homes killed children to
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:27.240]  evict Ugandans in name of global warming and they the the uh new york times
[03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:29.480]  and others say this is part of saving the earth
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:32.440]  uh now they have un world bank murder forces
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:35.640]  actually burning and shooting and killing and driving people off their own
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:40.280]  land in africa how's that sound bob it's been going on for over a hundred years
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:44.120]  i used to live in africa and uh you know you have one war
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:50.360]  after another one dictator after another but the bottom line is really this
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:56.200]  extermination getting rid of a useless eaters and that's what it's all
[03:03:56.200 --> 03:03:59.480]  really about in africa and then of course they move in
[03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:03.880]  and retake over all the natural resources
[03:04:03.880 --> 03:04:08.520]  you know they gave them all up to the the tribes that lived in the different
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:11.400]  countries now they're going to exterminate them
[03:04:11.400 --> 03:04:14.920]  and once they finish doing that then they'll take them back over again
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:18.680]  and that was always the plan well the the the the issue here is it's the world
[03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:22.680]  bank and the and and these greenie groups are actually saying it's for the
