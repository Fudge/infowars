[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:31.520]  Texas Alex Jones well this is it the day before Thanksgiving the 24th day of
[00:31.520 --> 00:37.980]  November 2010 national opt-out day and we will cover all of the different
[00:37.980 --> 00:42.900]  political fireworks as they unfold we've already had people stripping down into
[00:42.900 --> 00:47.780]  their Speedos with screw big sis painted on their back we had the first
[00:47.780 --> 00:52.420]  article on that at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com today it's now become a
[00:52.420 --> 00:57.180]  big national news story as well very exciting and I'm not tooting our horn
[00:57.180 --> 01:03.540]  that hey look we had it first we're continuing to drive the news like in
[01:03.540 --> 01:07.820]  the last six years we've pointed out that TSA plans to be on the streets of
[01:07.820 --> 01:12.500]  America with naked body scanners now it's happening weeks after we've been
[01:12.500 --> 01:17.740]  beating the drum hard the Hill newspaper AP Reuters they're all talking about it
[01:17.740 --> 01:23.100]  the alternative media really spearheaded by the drudge report is now
[01:23.100 --> 01:27.620]  forcing all of this out in the open very very exciting and there's so many
[01:27.620 --> 01:32.780]  facets to it I want to cover it coming up and open the phones up we have Joel
[01:32.780 --> 01:35.740]  Scalzen popping back in already had him on once this week but I got him on for
[01:35.740 --> 01:42.020]  30 minutes because of his deep research into the Korean Peninsula China using
[01:42.020 --> 01:47.300]  North Korea as a surrogate the United States and NATO using South Korea as a
[01:47.300 --> 01:53.580]  surrogate for conflict or as a pawn we have a representative coming on who's
[01:53.580 --> 01:58.100]  very upset member of Congress dealing with the TSA and we have Webster
[01:58.100 --> 02:02.580]  Tarpley popping in to give us his view on the North Korea situation and what's
[02:02.580 --> 02:06.060]  happening with the economy but all of our guests are just on for about 20
[02:06.060 --> 02:10.340]  minutes a piece today so we'll have time to also open the phones up and cover all
[02:10.340 --> 02:15.140]  of the other news obviously amazing economic developments we're going to be
[02:15.140 --> 02:24.220]  going over also going in at grocery stores salons malls fitness centers
[02:24.220 --> 02:30.700]  biometrics to buy and sell and this is just as dangerous as what the TSA is
[02:30.700 --> 02:36.300]  doing dr. Paul Craig Roberts calls it the TSA Gestapo Empire and that's what
[02:36.300 --> 02:43.100]  it is it's a minimum wage Gestapo by the feds who are above the law and operate
[02:43.100 --> 02:48.300]  outside of common law the Constitution and Bill of Rights that's exactly what's
[02:48.300 --> 02:51.740]  going on so we'll be covering that report as well but there's a lot of
[02:51.740 --> 02:56.820]  different facets to this TSA there's the fact that if anybody else did this they'd
[02:56.820 --> 03:01.540]  be arrested there's the fact that they're not above the law there's the fact
[03:01.540 --> 03:06.500]  that it's unsanitary there's the fact that it doesn't protect you and that
[03:06.500 --> 03:11.380]  the borders are wide open there's the issue of all the scientific polls show
[03:11.380 --> 03:16.660]  between 60 and 90 plus percent it varies against this and I see that in public
[03:16.660 --> 03:19.900]  opinion on the street plus it's unconstitutional so it doesn't matter of
[03:19.900 --> 03:24.060]  99% were for this you still can't do it but it just so happens the public's with
[03:24.060 --> 03:28.300]  the Constitution well we've seen this hoax from Ryan Williams on NBC I was on
[03:28.300 --> 03:32.540]  Mancow this morning was playing the clip of it saying 98% in their poll agree
[03:32.540 --> 03:38.380]  with it but all the other polls like Zogby are 61% totally opposed Reuters
[03:38.380 --> 03:43.540]  96% opposed I mean you know I mean you hear it on talk radio liberal
[03:43.540 --> 03:48.140]  conservative doesn't matter almost everybody calling in maybe 15 callers
[03:48.140 --> 03:52.620]  out of one I was listening to local radio this morning off and on all morning
[03:52.620 --> 03:56.420]  and you might go 20 callers cuz you know these shows are called ribbon I was
[03:56.420 --> 04:04.380]  listening to 590 to their morning show with Mark Ed and Sergeant Sam and then
[04:04.380 --> 04:08.380]  I was listening to the show came on after that and they'd go 15 20 calls for one
[04:08.380 --> 04:11.180]  person called in who agreeing with it and the people that agreed with it
[04:11.180 --> 04:15.980]  could hardly talk they're just like I think it's safe you don't let terrorists
[04:15.980 --> 04:21.100]  get we gotta do you know it's like you go to the doctor and they touch in ways
[04:21.100 --> 04:25.700]  you don't like to find out if you got proper proper prostate cancer you know
[04:25.700 --> 04:29.460]  one guy who was for it sound like porky pig and couldn't string sentences
[04:29.460 --> 04:37.140]  together child like mine probably had a 75 IQ no kidding I'm sorry he's probably
[04:37.140 --> 04:44.300]  calling from a government home or something I mean it's a lie that 98% of
[04:44.300 --> 04:47.780]  people agree with this and we all know it so that goes to the media I'm gonna
[04:47.780 --> 04:52.460]  get into North Korea situation first the economy then the TSA your phone
[04:52.460 --> 04:57.860]  calls it's all coming up on this opt-out day maybe I'll cover TSA first
[04:57.860 --> 05:02.820]  we'll get back I'm pretty fired about this what about you hundreds of nations
[05:02.820 --> 05:07.460]  have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to
[05:07.460 --> 05:12.220]  not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug
[05:12.220 --> 05:16.460]  from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our
[05:16.460 --> 05:20.700]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[05:20.700 --> 05:25.940]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall the
[05:25.940 --> 05:30.540]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[05:34.900 --> 05:38.660]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[05:38.660 --> 05:42.580]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[05:42.580 --> 05:48.140]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[07:01.220 --> 07:05.460]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[07:05.460 --> 07:09.240]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[07:09.240 --> 07:13.600]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[07:13.600 --> 07:17.960]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[07:17.960 --> 07:22.440]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[07:22.440 --> 07:27.160]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:27.160 --> 07:30.960]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.960 --> 07:34.600]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.600 --> 07:38.960]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[08:10.100 --> 08:16.320]  GCN radio network it is national opt-out day for many for many others
[08:16.320 --> 08:23.520]  it's no fly day triple a motor club estimates that there are going to be
[08:23.520 --> 08:29.000]  millions of additional cars on the road than what they saw last year because of
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.240]  surveys they've put out to their members who are avoiding aircraft so you've
[08:35.240 --> 08:38.720]  already seen a nine plus billion dollar a year of the Department of
[08:38.720 --> 08:44.400]  Transportation estimates decrease in tourism to this country estimated to be
[08:44.400 --> 08:52.560]  40 billion this year tourism is down by right at a third what it was in 2006 no
[08:52.560 --> 08:58.280]  one wants to come here there may be a large percentage I don't know if it's
[08:58.280 --> 09:03.320]  half or 40 percent of the public but the polls show it's less than half but
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.200]  still over a hundred million people in this country that are wanting to be
[09:08.200 --> 09:16.800]  slaves who are enjoying tyranny but the rest of us are saying and recognize what
[09:16.800 --> 09:21.880]  this is and the rest of the world sees it meanwhile who watches the watchers
[09:21.880 --> 09:25.640]  the TSA people the other airport employees why do we have all this
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.240]  justed airports I mean a terrorist could go in a shopping mall a terrorist could
[09:31.240 --> 09:37.040]  go to a school a terrorist could go to a hike and bike jogging trail a terrorist
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.240]  could go to your church well the federal government says that's right and big
[09:43.240 --> 09:47.720]  sis is in the news today saying they do want body scanners basically everywhere
[09:47.720 --> 09:52.160]  just minimum wage people this is the new economy this is the new service
[09:52.160 --> 09:59.920]  economy prison surveillance face scanning cameras minimum wage goons and I not
[09:59.920 --> 10:03.320]  against people that are overweight I'm a bit overweight myself but is it part of
[10:03.320 --> 10:09.360]  the TSA uniform that you've got to weigh 400 pounds and be pear shaped I mean is
[10:09.360 --> 10:13.480]  that a rule that you have to look like the stay puff marshmallow man I mean if
[10:13.480 --> 10:18.840]  I went and applied and I only weigh 235 pounds down from 265 a few years ago I
[10:18.840 --> 10:23.480]  need to be about 200 and I and I said sorry mr. Jones you only weigh 235
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.760]  pounds you got to put on about 160 pounds and then we're gonna make you a
[10:27.760 --> 10:33.360]  commander I saw another report I forgot to print well you guys print me the
[10:33.360 --> 10:40.160]  Atlanta Journal Constitution TSA employee kidnaps woman attempts to commit
[10:40.160 --> 10:45.440]  suicide I mean I see these reports every few days they're molesting some child or
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.200]  kidnapping people he was a behavior identification specialist these guys on
[10:50.200 --> 10:54.800]  power trips looking you in the eye like they've they've been you know given a
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.760]  degree by the federal government out of a cracker jack box now and they're the
[10:58.760 --> 11:06.640]  great Karnak from the fame of the Johnny Carson late show and they can
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.560]  magically tell and I've seen their training manuals their public you know
[11:10.560 --> 11:15.600]  are you someone sweating does someone look irritated oh yes you might have
[11:15.600 --> 11:19.600]  heartburn you might have been rushing to get to your gate you may be thinking
[11:19.600 --> 11:23.360]  you're about to miss your flight you may have a crying child with you you're
[11:23.360 --> 11:28.800]  sweating you look upset oh now we're gonna pull you out of line it's it's it's
[11:28.800 --> 11:37.720]  part of this mass absurdist mass delusion mental illness that that you
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.840]  everyone could be a terrorist it's the perfect enemy this foggy shadowy enemy
[11:42.840 --> 11:48.320]  that could never be defeated and and everyone is suspect and totally you know
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.200]  total police state is the only thing that can keep you safe and then meanwhile
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.040]  it's the government staging the terror of course ever think of that who's
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.240]  behind the terror who's taking your rights who stands to gain from this and
[11:59.240 --> 12:04.560]  then when you go research it guess who it is big brother big brother staging the
[12:04.560 --> 12:11.640]  events hearts filled TSA worker allegedly abducts assaults woman and it says
[12:11.640 --> 12:19.560]  that he is a behavior detection officer and generally I've seen these guys
[12:19.560 --> 12:23.320]  there's the one staring at you you got away 600 pounds to be one of those it's
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.720]  kind of like a hierarchy they may actually start like having giant motorized
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.640]  tanks for these self-propelled stomachs and perhaps they'll like roll in you know
[12:32.640 --> 12:36.400]  those folks that can't walk maybe they weigh 1,400 pounds and that'll be the
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.640]  head of the TSA in fact I think the head nationally shouldn't be pistol pistol
[12:40.640 --> 12:43.960]  looks like he's like shirt off about the starved death we probably need a
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.400]  1,200 1,400 pounder I'm sorry I got a lot of important news to cover I'm not
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.680]  making fun of people that are overweight folks it's just the image of people in
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.440]  police state thug outfits who are almost all obese prodding people getting off on
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.600]  the power I mean they can't get a job at McDonald's but now they rule you and
[13:03.600 --> 13:06.600]  they don't care if you don't like the radiation they don't care if you don't
[13:06.600 --> 13:12.760]  like groping you quit they hire somebody that does like groping and I've
[13:12.760 --> 13:16.880]  flown so much and see TSA with their eyes all slit looking at you being all
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.960]  serious shouting at people for you've got more than three ounces of shampoo you
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.760]  you've got a nail clipper and I'm like well it says I can have a nail clipper
[13:25.760 --> 13:32.000]  and they're just there to let you know hey they've arrived I have power I have
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.040]  power I'm God I mean this is the type of stuff they chant publicly in their
[13:37.040 --> 13:40.520]  mass delusions but they're failing they tried to intimidate they tried to
[13:40.520 --> 13:45.160]  scream opt out they admit that they grope you to humiliate you they pulled
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.840]  off the urology bags the colostomy bags the the the artificial breast women
[13:49.840 --> 13:53.760]  who've had mastectomies from breast cancer they've stripped the three-year-olds
[13:53.760 --> 13:57.720]  and our local talk radio going they've only searched about 12 kids just made
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.840]  up I saw them search 30 40 50 babies when I was in Santa Rosa a month ago
[14:03.840 --> 14:09.360]  she's me San Jose I was also in Santa Rosa but I flew out of San Jose that's
[14:09.360 --> 14:15.200]  all all they were searching was women and children that's all because they know
[14:15.200 --> 14:21.120]  they'll submit they're getting their quota of slaves run through all right
[14:21.120 --> 14:24.480]  I'm already ranting and I got a bunch of guests coming up but I'm not I need to
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.200]  get to the news here let's just get into the news okay and this is a more of
[14:29.200 --> 14:33.000]  this is coming up with Joel Scalson Webster Tarpley and we have a congressman
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.480]  joining us as well today China Russia quit dollar this is out of the China
[14:38.480 --> 14:43.040]  Daily the big Chinese government mouthpiece St. Petersburg Russia China
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.320]  and Russia have decided to renounce the US dollar and resort to using their own
[14:47.320 --> 14:52.080]  currencies for bilateral trade so they're they've made the move they've
[14:52.080 --> 14:55.280]  already been creeping away from the dollar but to accelerate it said there
[14:55.280 --> 14:59.080]  of the Chinese Premier and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin announced
[14:59.080 --> 15:05.920]  late last night Chinese experts said the move reflected closer relations between
[15:05.920 --> 15:09.160]  Beijing and Moscow and is not aimed at challenging the dollar but to protect
[15:09.160 --> 15:12.160]  their domestic economies yeah because the globalist the fellow reserve is
[15:12.160 --> 15:15.520]  devaluing the dollar people think of this is Russia China against the US
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.000]  they're certainly you know criminal organizations by and large as well it's
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.520]  that the the offshore corporate global government has been using the US as its
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.760]  engine and is now devaluing the dollar which all these countries hold and so
[15:29.760 --> 15:32.760]  they're just making the move to start getting away from it which is a smart
[15:32.760 --> 15:36.200]  move because they're accelerating the monetization of the debt the devaluation
[15:36.200 --> 15:42.760]  of it the last people to figure this out will be American yuppies that that
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.440]  6% or whatever in the real polls that are like I like them sticking my hand
[15:46.440 --> 15:52.160]  their hand down the pants keep me safe Chinese experts at the move reflected
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.800]  closer relations the two countries were accustomed to using other currencies
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.080]  especially the dollar for bilateral trade since the financial crisis however
[15:59.080 --> 16:03.760]  high-ranking officials on both sides began to explore other possibilities and
[16:03.760 --> 16:08.200]  so they say they're ditching the dollar for their bilateral trade of natural gas
[16:08.200 --> 16:16.000]  raw materials back and forth so big problems there but bankers don't care
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.520]  they've got their power and that's what matters and they hate America so this is
[16:19.520 --> 16:24.080]  a big big enjoyment for them list of problem banks grows despite solid net
[16:24.080 --> 16:28.360]  income that's how to see NBC we're gonna be covering that Portugal Spain hit by

[17:32.720 --> 17:37.920]  whole thing that kicked off a day and a half ago was us and South Korean forces
[17:37.920 --> 17:45.120]  in areas that North Korea claims right upon their shore firing artillery within
[17:45.120 --> 17:48.920]  just a few hundred yards of their shore and the North Koreans are not saying
[17:48.920 --> 17:53.080]  they're good their paranoid lunatic pure evil but the globalists that are the
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.120]  more organized evil they know what they're doing and so they need this
[17:56.120 --> 18:00.160]  political diversion to prop up the dollar a political diversion internationally
[18:00.160 --> 18:08.520]  it's I mean more of these proxy wars going on and now they're gonna send an
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.440]  aircraft carrier in to get right up against disputed areas just begging

[18:28.560 --> 18:38.040]  lost in a decade plus in Vietnam from 64 to 75 or so so usn's carrier to yellow

[18:51.760 --> 18:56.760]  North and South the exercise are likely to anger which in the past the press
[18:56.760 --> 19:00.320]  Washington not to send its aircraft carriers to the sea I mean this could
[19:00.320 --> 19:05.520]  cause World War three and I'm not the only one saying it China may spurn

[24:18.440 --> 24:25.000]  daily occurrence because Drudge realizes important news Ron Paul crotch
[24:25.000 --> 24:33.440]  groped by TSA calls for boycott of airlines and it's got the video and
[24:33.440 --> 24:38.840]  audio link to Ron Paul with my quote so to be clear sir you have had the enhanced
[24:38.840 --> 24:44.240]  pat down they have touched your crotch yes absolutely as I said and it's
[24:44.240 --> 24:53.120]  disgusting let me go over some of the TSA news that report if you want to read it
[24:53.120 --> 24:56.240]  still is on the drudge report it's just moved down the page some it's also up at
[24:56.240 --> 25:00.760]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com we have a great article up at info wars.com
[25:00.760 --> 25:05.880]  from Paul Craig Roberts TSA Gestapo Empire that breaks down their total
[25:05.880 --> 25:12.560]  takeover of society because they're announcing they want them in taxis they
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.920]  want them in bus stations train stations malls this is the takeover of
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.840]  society people are really starting to get it continuing this is one of the
[25:21.840 --> 25:27.640]  biggest issues going on right now here's just the latest LA Times reports on a
[25:27.640 --> 25:33.640]  Zogby poll 61% oppose new airport security measures they're worried about
[25:33.640 --> 25:40.440]  radiation they point out our borders are open they point out that there's a
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.760]  billion targets I mean I mean if terrorists could just drive out in the
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.920]  middle of the countryside on a Sunday morning walk into some Baptist church
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.440]  with 300 people in it and blow the place up or shoot people but the globalist
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.400]  really like to stage bombings because that creates fear it's something
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.960]  different and they've been able to do all this in airplanes because people
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.840]  always had common law for their cars their homes their persons they would
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.280]  never put up with that on the street so they started in the airport oh because
[26:12.280 --> 26:19.040]  that's something special that's flying on the eve of one of the nation's busiest
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.720]  travel days this was last night a poll has found that 61% of likely voters
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.120]  oppose the newly enhanced security measures at the country's airports and
[26:28.120 --> 26:35.560]  that's the Zogby poll of 2032 likely voters 48% said they would seek
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.680]  alternatives to flying because of new measures now I've seen other polls again
[26:40.680 --> 26:47.040]  of 96% out of 60 plus thousand respondents I've talked about listening to
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.680]  talk radio to get a gauge of the public I listened to probably two and a half
[26:51.680 --> 26:55.720]  hours of local radio this morning I listened mainly to one station listen
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.160]  to something to do another this was the all they were talking about I tuned in
[26:59.160 --> 27:03.120]  to San Antonio radio driving into the office heard the same thing every
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.800]  caller caller after caller after caller after them you know how mainline talk
[27:07.800 --> 27:11.120]  radio does they'll just give each caller 30 seconds for a quick comment hang up
[27:11.120 --> 27:17.320]  on caller after caller after caller and maybe every 10 15 20 you would hear
[27:17.320 --> 27:24.840]  somebody say they were for it meanwhile NBC last night Brian Williams says 98%
[27:24.840 --> 27:29.040]  of people in their poll agree with it folks there's no way that's true and
[27:29.040 --> 27:33.960]  that's why mainstream media has lost so much credibility they are attempting to
[27:33.960 --> 27:40.920]  with a straight face to tell you 98% of people agree with this but all the
[27:40.920 --> 27:50.640]  scientific polls are above 60% and again they tried to intimidate you they
[27:50.640 --> 27:53.760]  tried to imply you were gonna help terrorists they tried to yell opt out
[27:53.760 --> 28:00.120]  and admittedly groping you they told Atlantic monthly to make you go to the
[28:00.120 --> 28:03.360]  naked body scanners they tried to lie and say that scientists said the
[28:03.360 --> 28:09.240]  radiation was safe when the entire spectrum of scientists in government at
[28:09.240 --> 28:16.160]  John Hopkins she quoted big sis quoted John Hopkins two weeks ago as saying it
[28:16.160 --> 28:19.400]  was safe and then the head of the radiation department the radiology
[28:19.400 --> 28:22.480]  department came out and said it's not true I've written paper saying it's bad
[28:22.480 --> 28:26.400]  he was already in the news saying it was bad so she just came out and lied and
[28:26.400 --> 28:31.400]  said he endorsed it because she thinks you're not gonna go look it up
[28:31.400 --> 28:36.280]  remember just three weeks ago when I was the big liar three and a half weeks
[28:36.280 --> 28:40.400]  ago when Michelle was a big liar in my office about him touching her crotch
[28:40.400 --> 28:45.080]  remember TSA putting out press releases saying we don't do that and the news was
[28:45.080 --> 28:48.480]  like well we have all this video of you doing it you did that to our reporters
[28:48.480 --> 28:52.880]  now you've got Wall Street Journal New York Times ABC News there there's
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.040]  hundreds of mainline reporters going yeah they made me take my fake breast out
[28:58.040 --> 29:02.440]  I had breast cancer yeah they they touch my crotch hey they stuck their hand in
[29:02.440 --> 29:09.960]  my pants and the Republicans you got to love it I hear Rush Limbaugh on people
[29:09.960 --> 29:15.800]  trying to say Mr. President get your hands off my bag off my tea bag and I'm
[29:15.800 --> 29:18.200]  sorry to talk like that but that's what the media is covered that's what Limbaugh
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.440]  saying okay I'm reporting on him and look this all started decades ago this
[29:24.440 --> 29:28.400]  is not partisan but yes it's accelerating under Obama there are a
[29:28.400 --> 29:34.120]  bunch of control freaks but here's another poll majority opposed body
[29:34.120 --> 29:39.720]  scans so we're gonna get back into all this and hit all the facets and we

[38:08.760 --> 38:14.920]  works you know even before we had the works of the insiders admitting and
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.360]  confirming what Cleon Scalcin said like the author of tragedy and hope of
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.600]  course Bill Clinton's mentor Carol Quigley world affairs brief calm I
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.760]  wanted to get him on because there have been so many new developments just to
[38:28.760 --> 38:33.600]  recap for those that joined us Washington Times U.S. since carrier group to

[38:38.000 --> 38:43.840]  areas that are disputed again a major provocation I'm no fan of the lunatic
[38:43.840 --> 38:48.000]  hermit hereditary dictatorship controlled by China of North Korea but
[38:48.000 --> 38:52.120]  this is a provocation China may spurn Obama appealed to reign in North Korea
[38:52.120 --> 38:56.840]  after attack on the South started by the earlier South Korean provocation going
[38:56.840 --> 39:02.000]  into the waters we also have one to telegraph North Korea attacks are we
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  skipping towards a nuclear apocalypse very very serious the info wars.com
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.280]  story Pentagon to send aircraft carrier strike group into the areas right off
[39:11.280 --> 39:16.720]  the coast of North Korea we also have the amazing China daily which is you know
[39:16.720 --> 39:18.960]  we're pretty much an authorized government front group for the
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.600]  communist Chinese headline China Russia quit dollar they signed the deal last
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.320]  night to start trading with each other natural gas and oil from Russia for raw
[39:28.320 --> 39:32.160]  materials and rare earth minerals and finished goods from China this is a big
[39:32.160 --> 39:37.320]  deal and it's right down Joel Scalcin's alley with his research Joel we've got
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.600]  about 22 minutes left with you appreciate you joining us break down what do you
[39:41.600 --> 39:47.160]  think this signifies geopolitically. Thanks Alex it's good to be with you let me
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.360]  give some perspective to this in since the Armistice you know there's still
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.680]  technically a war in North Korea South Korea since the Armistice there had been
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.560]  150 acts of war on the part of the North Koreans versus the South Koreans or US
[40:01.560 --> 40:08.280]  just a brief rundown three assassination attempts on presidents of state dozens
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.320]  of kidnappings three American soldiers killed at the border zone three five
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.760]  ships attacked including the recent patrol board attack three airliners
[40:17.760 --> 40:24.840]  hijacked three anti or artillery attacks on the South two missiles fired three
[40:24.840 --> 40:28.120]  American reconnaissance aircraft attacked over the years these are
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.640]  occurring almost twice a year ever since this has happened there've been four
[40:32.640 --> 40:36.160]  bombs planted in South Korea by the North there've been dozens of fishing
[40:36.160 --> 40:41.480]  vessels captured and held by the Pueblo and that there's US Pueblo which is the
[40:41.480 --> 40:45.560]  last photo mine is a major US reconnaissance ship captured never
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.920]  returned crew in prison these are acts of war and the US has done nothing but
[40:51.920 --> 40:57.640]  pontificate now this is I gave his background because I want to say that
[40:57.640 --> 41:02.920]  even though these appear to be huge provocation it is my analysis they will
[41:02.920 --> 41:08.480]  not amount to anything in fact I think that Lindsay Williams the distant or
[41:08.480 --> 41:13.240]  sources throwing out well has been throwing out this information ever
[41:13.240 --> 41:17.080]  since the oil prediction which was correct they often do that start with
[41:17.080 --> 41:20.480]  something correct and then start to do things which haven't happened it won't
[41:20.480 --> 41:25.480]  happen now I'm not downplaying the fact that China is the big problem in North
[41:25.480 --> 41:31.360]  Korea is it's it's lackey but I believe very strongly strategically that North
[41:31.360 --> 41:35.960]  Korea is being saved as a trigger event for World War three something very big
[41:35.960 --> 41:42.800]  and much further down the line in other words this is Iran is not a how should I
[41:42.800 --> 41:48.160]  say a diversion Iran is the next country to be attacked and you will mark my
[41:48.160 --> 41:54.360]  words Alex this will pass in so many words and they will continue to play
[41:54.360 --> 41:59.400]  Kate North Korea for these egregious acts of war do nothing to them no regime
[41:59.400 --> 42:04.800]  change no attacks no retaliation and North Korea will not in fact attack the
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.280]  US fleet out there but we will see a continual attack in the Middle East and
[42:09.280 --> 42:14.040]  Iran will be targeted sometimes well to correct myself because as I said and I
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.920]  realized that it wasn't the full spectrum of what Williams source that he's now
[42:19.920 --> 42:27.560]  revealed I had told him who clearly is an insider that now Iran is on the map but
[42:27.560 --> 42:33.560]  after that to watch China and Russia because they were the big players do
[42:33.560 --> 42:38.280]  you agree with what Williams source said yes absolutely as long as he's not
[42:38.280 --> 42:42.160]  saying that this is the immediate source because it is not and that's what I'm
[42:42.160 --> 42:47.120]  trying to say is that North there's a pattern of permissiveness with North
[42:47.120 --> 42:52.400]  Korea that is just unexplainable these are the way that we treat Iran if Iran I
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.800]  mean the US has been begging Iran to do any one of these things trying
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.920]  assassination stuff in Iraq kidnap someone have an artillery attack on
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.560]  Iraq or a missile attack or shoot down a US aircraft can you imagine we would be
[43:06.560 --> 43:12.280]  at war attacking Iran within 30 minutes if they did this this would be God's
[43:12.280 --> 43:18.280]  gift to Obama to George Bush to give them an excuse to attack and that just
[43:18.280 --> 43:24.240]  shows the hypocrisy Iran is nowhere near the danger that North Korea is to the
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.440]  world with its weapons programs with its proliferation of weapons nuclear
[43:28.440 --> 43:33.280]  proliferation its missile program and yet we do nothing in fact we guarantee
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.920]  that no regime change we guarantee no military interference interference what
[43:38.920 --> 43:44.760]  was the 1988 event at the end of the Iran-Iraq war where I've seen it
[43:44.760 --> 43:49.880]  reported it's the biggest US naval engagement since the end of World War
[43:49.880 --> 43:54.600]  2 is how they bill it where they destroyed a bunch of Iranian battleship
[43:54.600 --> 44:03.280]  they called it Operation Praying Manus yes and it was very very serious at
[44:03.280 --> 44:07.080]  that time of course they didn't have the war on terror going on they didn't have
[44:07.080 --> 44:13.120]  the provocations to be able to mount that attack on Iran in fact and so it was
[44:13.120 --> 44:19.120]  not anything related to the current war or current plans on attacking Iran you
[44:19.120 --> 44:23.000]  know we had the major shoot down of one of the Iranian airliners at one time too
[44:23.000 --> 44:32.720]  which probably was in fact a mistake but you know Iran it certainly helped to
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.320]  inspire a great deal of hatred towards America and I think that's what in essence
[44:37.320 --> 44:42.840]  the Iranian Iranian attack will become is feeling the nail on the coffin of the
[44:42.840 --> 44:47.120]  US is the bully of the world we're going to look very very bad Israel's gonna look
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.720]  very very bad in attacking Iran and destroying a lot of infrastructure
[44:50.720 --> 44:55.160]  there but I think we have to be very careful to take this in perspective what's
[44:55.160 --> 44:59.680]  happening in North Korea and look at the wordage of the United States you know
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.680]  we are outraged they say and yet we must insist on a measured unified response
[45:04.680 --> 45:07.920]  to North Korean attack and what do they do they go to the Chinese that we want
[45:07.920 --> 45:12.200]  you to rein in your little puppet country China does nothing they never
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.200]  will do anything about China the US will never do anything about China's refusal
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.880]  to do that let me ask you this Joel back in the mid-1990s Bill Clinton gets the
[45:22.880 --> 45:28.880]  blame and he deserves a large portion of it for allowing Long Island Hughes to
[45:28.880 --> 45:37.280]  transfer the ICBM systems the MIRV reentry blueprints but also the head of
[45:37.280 --> 45:43.080]  ABB the Swiss company headed up by Rumsfeld Donald Rumsfeld transferring
[45:43.080 --> 45:50.440]  the reactor systems to them as well so clearly why did the West allow a Q
[45:50.440 --> 45:56.360]  Khan laboratories to develop nuclear weapons why did England the United States
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.640]  and Israel to some extent help give nukes to Pakistan help give nukes to
[46:00.640 --> 46:07.880]  North Korea but then freak out over Iran well as I say this is our care versus
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.360]  the ones that aren't in our control the ones that we want to use for provocations
[46:12.360 --> 46:16.360]  of a world war three and I think there is a very long-term process involved in
[46:16.360 --> 46:25.840]  this I mean we know for example the part of the Khan nuclear spying ring was
[46:25.840 --> 46:29.880]  instrumental in giving Iran their start in their nuclear program and they in
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.960]  fact gave it gave them according to the CIA this may be disinformation flawed
[46:33.960 --> 46:39.240]  plans that wouldn't work in fact but the US had very much to do with getting a
[46:39.240 --> 46:44.240]  rainy program started in nuclear war of course with Pakistan as well I think
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.800]  we're looking at some very sophisticated levels of conflict creation here the
[46:48.800 --> 46:57.240]  entire Pakistani India is a potential trigger event for major hostility well
[46:57.240 --> 47:00.320]  Brzezinski admits that in his books exactly what you're saying I mean he's
[47:00.320 --> 47:06.560]  pretty open about it that's right but remember it's complex in the sense that
[47:06.560 --> 47:11.120]  India was a client state of Russia for many years and now it started to transit
[47:11.120 --> 47:16.040]  the West is trying to woo in India away from Russia's field of influence
[47:16.040 --> 47:21.480]  Pakistan for years was a client state of China and the US successfully wooed
[47:21.480 --> 47:26.720]  China way specifically over the nuclear program China was not giving nuclear
[47:26.720 --> 47:31.920]  weapons to Pakistan and the US came in through a kickoff and did it and that's
[47:31.920 --> 47:37.200]  what got all of the Chinese or the Pakistani elite in the ISI and the
[47:37.200 --> 47:41.080]  controllers in the military tied to the US they've been tied there ever since
[47:41.080 --> 47:46.960]  there's still a T2T going on between China trying to woo back Pakistan but
[47:46.960 --> 47:52.280]  I'm not sure exactly how this is going to play out in the world war I know that
[47:52.280 --> 47:59.480]  when it finally launched China is very very worried about India being in its
[47:59.480 --> 48:03.640]  backyard I mean India's got as many potential soldiers as China does and
[48:03.640 --> 48:09.560]  probably capable of better training so if that turns on China at some point
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.280]  they could be in trouble so they're very very interested in keeping hold of
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.480]  India and Pakistan they've lost Pakistan I don't think that'll ever come back
[48:17.480 --> 48:25.160]  again except as a means of undermining Iran India and that's the
[48:25.160 --> 48:31.120]  counterpoint there if India as you know let's just go back China is
[48:31.120 --> 48:36.560]  presently allied with Russia in their plans on attacking the West someday but
[48:36.560 --> 48:41.680]  China knows very well that they'll have to fight Russia and break their bonds
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.240]  just like Russian Hitler had to find they fight it out so China's very very
[48:47.240 --> 48:51.240]  worried about Russian influence India and that's the reason why they took so
[48:51.240 --> 48:56.480]  much time to try to give arms and munitions and aid to Pakistan so that
[48:56.480 --> 49:02.160]  they can have counterpoint against India the US has played into this by giving
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.880]  Pakistan nuclear weapons knowing that Russia had given India nuclear weapons
[49:07.880 --> 49:13.040]  the US gave nuclear weapons to Pakistan in order to help the Chinese in their
[49:13.040 --> 49:19.520]  feeling of being able to counter Indian military influence so I think this is
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.720]  part of the ploy of the West of playing into China's back pocket in other words
[49:24.720 --> 49:29.520]  we're helping you out we're transferring technology we're not trying to do it
[49:29.520 --> 49:33.880]  openly we're playing like you know I mean even the Pentagon every year has
[49:33.880 --> 49:39.640]  this great assessment about the Chinese military threat they downplay it every
[49:39.640 --> 49:43.680]  year and I think that this T2T going to have this understanding which I don't
[49:43.680 --> 49:48.360]  worry we have to play up to our own people that we're you know opposing your
[49:48.360 --> 49:51.840]  military but they don't do anything against well isn't this just a replay
[49:51.840 --> 49:57.600]  of the West building up Japan and enticing them to expand all over the
[49:57.600 --> 50:03.480]  Pacific before World War two yeah I think it is I think China's gonna play
[50:03.480 --> 50:06.800]  that same role in World War three they're gonna tie up the entire Pacific
[50:06.800 --> 50:10.600]  they're gonna they got a grudge match with Japan they're gonna take Japan all
[50:10.600 --> 50:15.080]  the way down to an including Australian defeat New Zealand and that's why I
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.840]  don't recommend you know what can you imagine though what's gonna happen what
[50:18.840 --> 50:22.840]  the you want to see terrorism as they call it that's anybody that resists you
[50:22.840 --> 50:26.560]  imagine what the Japanese are gonna do if the if the Chinese actually try to
[50:26.560 --> 50:33.720]  physically take Japan well I think they they will at least neutralize that I
[50:33.720 --> 50:36.640]  mean you know the Chinese really don't have a great deal of military that
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.520]  didn't depend on the US for so many years you know I understand I'm talking
[50:40.520 --> 50:43.960]  about just the asymmetrical on the ground what the Japanese will do once
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.800]  the Chinese visit but they may just run them through a puppet to yeah they
[50:48.800 --> 50:52.120]  could do that too all right Joel stay there I want to shift gears and see where

[53:57.280 --> 54:19.760]  where an emergency will strike the Babylon system is the vampire
[54:19.760 --> 54:28.080]  so what's your time frame on this world war three situation what do you see
[54:28.080 --> 54:36.360]  unfolding in the interim and then even the CFR last week said hey we better get
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.920]  out of Afghanistan and Pakistan and they normally you know on policy as you
[54:40.920 --> 54:46.600]  know publicly call the shots kind of a lower house of the private corporate
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.080]  government but now the military says no basically we're not leaving Iraq we're
[54:51.080 --> 54:55.800]  not leaving Central Asia we're not leaving Afghanistan and now headline
[54:55.800 --> 55:02.080]  Afghan violence sores insurgency expanding US violence in Afghanistan in
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.360]  all-time high in recent months as Western troops battled an increasingly
[55:06.360 --> 55:11.120]  sophisticated insurgency expanding across the country the US military said
[55:11.120 --> 55:17.960]  yesterday so break it down for us well a couple of major problems first of all
[55:17.960 --> 55:22.240]  remember that and I'm sure you know this that the CFR and other types in the
[55:22.240 --> 55:29.320]  elite will often start when it went up a position becomes unpopular this start
[55:29.320 --> 55:33.120]  putting some of their advisors out giving counter position like
[55:33.120 --> 55:37.720]  Brzezinski came out against all of the Bush years than the denouncing that even
[55:37.720 --> 55:41.560]  though he was all pro-soviet and everything during the Carter years now
[55:41.560 --> 55:45.640]  we're starting to come out and attack the Afghan war is unwinnable from some
[55:45.640 --> 55:48.760]  of the elite they're positioning themselves for the fact that this will
[55:48.760 --> 55:53.760]  become a black market will become an unpopular war very unpopular very soon
[55:53.760 --> 55:57.040]  and they're going to be having advisors positioning themselves for the
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.760]  Republican side who will start to attack the Afghan war as part of the
[56:01.760 --> 56:07.560]  presidential view it's not going to get better the Afghan police for example
[56:07.560 --> 56:14.840]  which is the this is the crown jewel of our release from active combat troops
[56:14.840 --> 56:19.240]  to be able to let Afghan police take over and they're so corrupt there's so
[56:19.240 --> 56:24.720]  many of the tribal leaders that control the Afghan police that they simply Afghan
[56:24.720 --> 56:29.240]  military trainers simply don't have any confidence the Afghan police will do
[56:29.240 --> 56:33.520]  anything that cause a great deal of unrest within Afghanistan they have even
[56:33.520 --> 56:40.280]  less support than the cars diverging so this is a non-playing a plan that they've
[56:40.280 --> 56:45.480]  got to be able to you know transfer autonomy to Afghan military and police
[56:45.480 --> 56:49.240]  forces but the social engineers had to know that as well and they did so what's
[56:49.240 --> 56:53.840]  the master strategy just hold down the area to pump out 500 million in opium a
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.680]  black hole for weapons sales and a way to have a another base on the doorstep of
[56:59.680 --> 57:06.240]  China well I really think that the Afghan and in Iraqi situation is being held
[57:06.240 --> 57:11.280]  over for the Iran war especially this is what's going to justify all of those
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.280]  troops being there as they mass you know for there's mostly going to be an
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.720]  aerial attack I think you know on Iran but there will be some troops justified
[57:20.720 --> 57:25.120]  for staying in the region because even if they take out all of the
[57:25.120 --> 57:31.440]  infrastructure military infrastructure in Iran it still becomes a seizing pile
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.360]  of Muslims that are just going to have so much hatred for the West that all of
[57:36.360 --> 57:39.120]  our soldiers are going to be risked in this whole region and then we may have
[57:39.120 --> 57:43.560]  real attacks which the globalists will then use to clamp down on the American
[57:43.560 --> 57:47.320]  people so clearly you're right they haven't circled Iran for that purpose
[57:47.320 --> 57:52.760]  what's the time frame from your intel on the strike on Iran well I think it's
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.000]  going to be this year they're still looking for a provocation and
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.720]  justification of it but I think it's going to be this year relative to your
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.240]  question about what I think about the third world war and when one of these
[58:04.240 --> 58:07.600]  trigger events going to go off I think it's probably going to be an attack of
[58:07.600 --> 58:12.400]  North Korea on South Korea in earnest to which the US has to respond probably
[58:12.400 --> 58:17.320]  with tactical nuclear weapons they have such an overwhelming majority of troops
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.840]  there that we cannot stop them and all of our 26,000 US troops will be at risk I
[58:21.840 --> 58:28.840]  think 2005 there's a 50 50 I'm sorry 2015 50 50 chance it could happen but more
[58:28.840 --> 58:33.080]  likely almost for the end of the decade because China won't be ready till then
[58:33.080 --> 58:36.060]  all right Joe hold on do five more minutes with the if you can I want you
[58:36.060 --> 58:39.280]  to have five minutes to really walk through this scenario slowly we'll be

[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.840]  alex jones
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.840]  we've got a surprise congressman popping in about 30 minutes is very upset
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:38.560]  about the airline chicanery and slave training going on that's backfiring on

[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:57.400]  1-800-259-9231-8259-9231 we got about four minutes left with Joel
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.000]  Scalson a world affairs brief if you just joined us he was getting into his
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  global strategic world view from studying the globalist that I think is
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.240]  very accurate for my own research I concur with much of what he's saying I
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.280]  think that's the general direction that the global power blocks are moving in
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.560]  four minutes sum up the next eight years as you say and and where the hot spots
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:27.520]  are and what this overall plan is by Foundation X okay before I get into that
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.600]  just want to make a clarification when I said when do I think they're gonna
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:34.080]  tack around when I said this year I didn't mean 2010 I mean in the next 12
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.000]  months yes because this year is almost through going back to this general
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.040]  scenario remember that we're Russia is is running this show China is going to be
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.400]  tagging along as the ally to back up Russia in its nuclear attack on the
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:56.240]  West China wants to play the role is not the primary attack and because it wants
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:02.440]  to position itself to be the Cold War opposer of the West after it becomes the
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.400]  ally of the West during the war it's like Russia Russia comes in and helps the
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.360]  West beat Germany and then becomes the new Cold War enemy and gets all these
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.880]  concessions from the United States in the process that's what China is setting
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:18.880]  itself up to the China will be careful not to appear to be too much of the
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:25.120]  enemy even though they will take I think when this war starts the Pacific in
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:31.160]  order to guard the the rear of Russia and then from that position they'll attack
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.840]  Russia sometime during the war so that the West can't win the war against Russia
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.720]  then it will be the West versus China that's the big picture now in doing so I
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:45.080]  don't think that China will do ravaging attacks on Japan the Philippines
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.800]  Australia New Zealand I think they'll occupy or in circle to keep them
[01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.240]  contained but will not do a lot of damage so that when they switch sides they
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:59.280]  won't be viewed too much because the enemy now in terms of timing we have to
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.840]  watch Russia because Russia is the one that's calling the shots here right
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.720]  now the West is in the middle of giving everything away to the Russians in NATO
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.680]  for example doing a joint military missile defense with Russia Russia says
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.960]  we'll cover your east and you take up the missile defense in in Western Europe
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.920]  itself what they're doing and this is very very interesting they're saying
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:28.800]  we'll put our own missile defenses in here to guard against Islamic you know
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.200]  road missile attacks but they're taking the prime position to be able to use
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.600]  anti-blistic missiles to or to keep Western anti-blistic missiles from
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.840]  shooting down their own missiles in their boost phase by taking the near east
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:47.640]  position I don't know if I'm being clear what I'm saying yes we're here but it's
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.520]  very very important for the West to understand that the French who are now
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.800]  driving the agenda in NATO are completely selling out to the Russians
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:03.280]  why just for natural gas sir no no it seems to be part of the globalist agenda
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.400]  sure natural gas is being driven by the by the EU has been called by Lord
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.040]  Moncton many others properly the new Soviet that's right it is a new Soviet
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:16.920]  and they're basically it's really a control of who's gonna run this new
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.360]  world war the Russians want to run it the Anglo-American establishment know
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.480]  that they intend to run it and they have to eliminate Russia in the process but
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.800]  they're in the process of luring Russia in and getting it to be confident enough
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.920]  to attack the West that's been the West problem all these years is trying to get
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.880]  Russia over that's why the disarmament but that's why taking out our MX missile
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.640]  even when they were nigg done bears you know Joel this is too important I
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.720]  promise to go to calls but can you come back on the other side of the quick
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:48.360]  break and for three minutes put bookends on this and explain in basics the
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:52.320]  factions you see how you see it playing out this is so important can you come
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.160]  back for three more minutes yeah I will okay we will and I promise folks 800 to
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.320]  five at nine ninety two thirty one we're going to write your calls stay with us
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.880]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.200]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.400]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:16.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:33.040]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.760]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.960]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.320]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.960]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.840]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.760]  going to your phone calls in a moment Joel Scalcin editor of world affairs
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:26.080]  brief researching the new owner for decades of course joining us here
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.040]  talking about the different power blocks the Anglo-American establishment the
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:36.000]  Chinese block dominating Asia the Russian block now from a lot of evidence
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.480]  I've seen is teamed up with the EU you've got the Vatican strangely enough
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.120]  being involved in the founding of the EU how many different power blocks do you
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.480]  see I mean they're all interconnected but just briefly from your view name the
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:56.640]  power blocks well the three there are three major and only three true power
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.840]  blocks China Russia in the US China Russia and the Anglo-American establishment
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.120]  it's it's not just the US or it's England as well yeah it's England as well they
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.720]  they're still locked together to try to control the world in a new world order
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:15.880]  but there are several subgroups underneath those it's very difficult to
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.360]  track those for example we have you know dozens organization like committee of
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:25.480]  300 the Bilderberg group the CFLR trilateral Commission I think the
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.040]  trilateral Commission is up there at but they're very top in the Anglo-American
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:35.480]  establishment and they essentially control CFR underneath them the CFR is
[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.000]  more visible Bilderberg group I view as more of a leadership conference where
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.520]  they're bringing in people bringing up in the system testing their ability to
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.960]  interact and in these private conferences but the big decisions aren't
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.320]  made at Bilderberger they're usually made in private meetings before them
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.640]  there is a Vatican connection there which is deep deep underground that's kept
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:04.520]  way way underneath the surface is it part of Foundation X I think it is I
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.760]  think because Foundation X is very very hyper sensitive about nobody knowing
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.800]  who they are that seems to be the Vatican connection as well is there and
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.720]  that matches with that but as I say nobody knows what's going on deep inside
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:24.160]  the foundation they should X around these people are hyper secretable I agree
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.760]  with you on the Vatican connection because studying the founding documents
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:33.600]  of the EU of the Bilderberg group I mean when you go back to the Treaty of
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:40.920]  Rome the Treaty of London in 46 the Treaty of Rome in 59 that's when the EU
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:45.480]  was really founded I mean that was the Vatican in there really getting that
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.320]  done but then we see a lot of the Anglo-American establishment constantly
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.960]  attacking the Vatican so we do see that fight going on that's right and you see
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.640]  a lot more of it going on in the Israel interaction but the yes working there in
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:04.720]  Israel trying to co-opt Israel sovereignty etc and so they're working that
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:12.560]  angle very very strongly very so who are the Rothschilds teamed up with as I
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:16.760]  say I don't really know what's going on at the very top levels I know they
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:21.560]  coordinate and have strong control over the US faction yeah Federal Reserve and
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.960]  things like that but frankly I would be if I'd be lying to say I knew what was
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.920]  going on in the inside because I'm not an insider I don't know okay so we have
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.600]  these three blocks I agree with you there the globalists admit this in their
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.440]  own policy reports they're very secretive about Foundation X so so so socialist
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:41.640]  international we've got to talk about yes you're a socialist international is
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:45.720]  a Moscow driven front they know very very well that the Communist Party is
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.640]  still alive and well and calling the shots in Russia through Medvedev and
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.760]  Putin and actually working through the oligarchs the oligarchs are really the
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:02.480]  old-line communist leaders who have faked their their rejuvenated view of
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.960]  being you know mafia oligarchs capitalist they're no such thing they are
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.800]  the communist leaders but the socialists international still run by those oligarchs
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:16.000]  and that's why they are in Europe but they're playing a very interesting role
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.240]  Tony Blair was very big in the socialists international and outright
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:25.080]  Marxist he came over to the globalist side and really ran carried water for
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.080]  the globalist during the entire Iraq war whether or not he was doing that as an
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.240]  infiltrator from the socialist international whether he was really
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:40.400]  truly bought out and converted to the our side of the globalist side of that
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:45.560]  I'm not sure and notice black water converted to Catholicism Prince and so
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:51.720]  did Blair that's right and that's got to have to do with the major top level
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.480]  controllers worth to think points at the Vatican and French President Sarkozy
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.320]  it's very interesting that the French now are leading the charge instead of the
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:06.320]  US they're kind of playing up to Russia on part of Europe trying to snooker
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.560]  Europe into accepting Russia as a full partner in peace they're saying the most
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.720]  egregious stupid idiotic things about Russia being no threat they're fully
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.400]  integratable as into Europe and that's exactly what Europe wants or what Russia
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:25.560]  wants in terms of being able to insert all of their spies and military people
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.040]  in this case so to interrupt and finish this we'll have you back soon the three
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:32.880]  different groups all infiltrating each other but the Anglo-american establishment
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:37.400]  from from my research is the most powerful the most wealthy the most
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.080]  cutting the most successful and they are planning to invite this attack and then
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.000]  destroy their enemies and then be able to set up the complete fascist world
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.520]  government is that where you see this going absolutely the nuclear attack is
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.640]  essential for our leaders coming out of their bunkers and convincing the US to
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.760]  go into a militarized in the world order excluding Russian China because they're
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.960]  now the enemy and we will be disarmed in the sense of saying you know yeah
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.280]  there's no problem we don't have any communists as part of this League of
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.040]  Democracy now whatever it's going to take us into this terrible war and that's
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:16.440]  how we lose our so that's the original Ram Corporation COG plan that's right
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:20.640]  they will not return sovereignty to us after this war because China will be the
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:25.360]  new enemy and they'll be so big and so strong that the UN or whatever its name
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.960]  will be left to say we have to remain armed as an international force to
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.240]  confront this great world power China yeah no I agree with you and you think
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.120]  that that within eight years this would have already happened yeah I am I'm
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.760]  thinking it's these things tend to take longer it's been taken decades to
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.720]  convince Russia to attack the United States they're getting ready they're
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.640]  planning but it's still they're scared to death that what we know what they
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:53.880]  know we're hiding and Joe we're gonna have you back up sometime in December if
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:58.640]  you can do it for two hours to really go through this and break it all down
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.760]  because I tend to agree with you that's what all the evidence shows and we're
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.200]  coming to the same conclusion and we've got to talk about a way to try to
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.280]  avert this world affairs brief calm thanks for spending time with us my
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.480]  pleasure Alex always great having you on okay folks bye bye I'm gonna get to
[01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.000]  your calls we've got a congressman coming up but I will take a lot of calls
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  let's be quick about it Carolyn in Tennessee are on the air go ahead well
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.840]  Alex I'm a priest God and I was able to get on and talk to you again I've been
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.160]  trying to call for a few days now I spoke to about a week ten days ago and
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:35.320]  told you that they are telling us that we have to take the flu shot in the
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.760]  Wellmont hospital system down here in Rogersville Tennessee my little
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:45.360]  hospital is forcing people to take the shot or get fired and it's all color of
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.360]  law and they tried all this last year and it came out in court that they
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:54.280]  cannot force you to do that or wear a mask the message is the flu which kills
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.880]  a lot less people than automobiles or anything else you've got to do this to
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.520]  set the precedent to make the first responders take it so you will then go
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:06.760]  along with forcing us to take it yeah and this is probably a first step of
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.440]  course to getting the force inoculation for the rest of the country you start
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:16.840]  small and you work up I've been they're telling us that people are emailing them
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.760]  from the companies just praising them for having us take this flu shot and
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:25.760]  they're oh so thrilled to be being forced to take it but I started reading
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:32.480]  some blogs and from times net me time times net news net there's excellent
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.160]  people talking in there they're so articulate man they already tried this
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:40.160]  last year you need to organize with people at work politely and pull out
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.080]  the insert of that can cause Guillaume beret it lowers your immunity print out
[01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.200]  the mainstream news articles that seasonal flu shot h1n1 shot as well
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.680]  lowers immunity to flu you need to just print it out and say no and they start
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.920]  threatening you go look I don't want to have to sue you but they are certainly
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:05.560]  trying to force this on the population so what can I do for you today well I've
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:11.200]  got a lawsuit you might want to make reference to Virginia Mason Hospital
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:16.080]  versus the Washington State Nurses Association where the Nurses Association
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:22.240]  was able to litigate this and overcome and say you couldn't force these nurses
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.480]  to take the shot yeah same thing in Massachusetts same thing in New York they
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.960]  they tried to make you take them under not even state laws the state just
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.280]  ordered it kind of like we don't have a law but minimum wage federal goons are
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.200]  gonna stick their hands down your pants I mean it's called tyranny they're just
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:44.000]  doing it but I'd seen that suit before give me the name of it again not just
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.920]  for myself but for everybody else listening so they have that case law to
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.880]  show the hospitals being bribed and buffaloed into this give us the name of
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:58.720]  the case again okay one thing after this please Virginia Mason Hospital versus

[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.480]  talking to like radiologists on the news and they're saying the scan at the

[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.040]  one's upset seeing it and others have been reporting all day that that
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.440]  everything's going smoothly that's because they already pat down in search
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:40.000]  most people you know the point is record numbers of people aren't flying and so
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.760]  they always want to teach us that we don't have power James but we do have

[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:38.700]  how they that she knows they're covering covering it up her name's and
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:45.600]  Woodlack speaks that's the headline and it's on click on Detroit.com and she's
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:50.920]  she knows it's covered up and she's saying that her husband told her that
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.440]  you know something might happen to him and it's like nobody's doing nothing
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.720]  here and what specifically is going on her husband got her husband got

[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:19.640]  head and a bullet in his lung and no one found the first court or examiner
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.960]  never found it but the second one that the wife hired found all that and she's
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.960]  saying that her husband was talking about stuff like if something happens you
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:33.280]  know I was killed well I mean we saw that in in Arkansas a lot with Clinton
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.520]  people have their heads cut off they'd be shot in the back of the head and

[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.320]  changed Rhode Island in truth radio we were just hosting a rally at TF Green
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.840]  Airport in Pondett's Rhode Island and my cameraman got physically assaulted we
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.960]  got around filming everything else we got physically assaulted they told us but
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.640]  the signs down the cameras down they kept threatening us and I want to make
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.120]  sure media came over they quickly drop you know what they were doing and they
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.680]  walked away from us and when the mainstream media after they did an
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:37.320]  interview with us right away they accommodated physically pushed us off
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:40.840]  the airport property like physically they pushed us in the back off the airport
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:48.400]  property okay so yes so so there's protests going on all over the country
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.720]  we know that and who was shoving on you who was physically going after you not
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.920]  the airport police themselves but the directors you know the head people of
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.960]  the airport police the you know the state police were flying you know they
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.280]  didn't bother the airport police we stand around our cycle a bunch of
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:09.240]  terrorists and the two directors the suit guys they pushed us and physically
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.560]  pushed us off the airport property they put in the hands on our cameras telling
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.080]  us we can't film and we have a case law right here it says freedom of
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.600]  expression on private property I get the case law it's on our freedom forum
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.680]  dot org and it's a free expression on private property it's a case law that
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:29.360]  gives us the right to protest on any property that serves the public and well
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.960]  absolutely there is case law because it's quasi public because taxpayer money
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  was used to build it they just say that it's private and they do this at
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.440]  community centers you name it we'll get that video up as soon as you can to
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.680]  YouTube because you know this is the hottest news story right now it's a real
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.800]  issue people are concerned and so if people wait a week or two to put the
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.640]  video up it won't have as big an effect that video everybody out there there's
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.440]  protest nationwide of the TSA thuggery of their attempt to violate your first

[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.280]  of representative who's on with us right now but I had no idea that there in
[01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:36.840]  Knoxville Tennessee he is a listener to the show representative John Duncan and
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:42.180]  of course he's made headlines across the country in the last few weeks
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:48.360]  criticizing the TSA and their activities here's the headline Duncan last TSA
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.680]  Pat Downs body scans in floor speech and then I was just talking to him during
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:57.000]  the break and he heard Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano on the show
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  yesterday so he'll be with us for about 25 minutes but hopefully the first of
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:07.080]  many visits so we'll give a shout out to WBCR 1470 that we've been on for about
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:13.040]  a decade there in the Knoxville area and I would also add on the new American
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.680]  magazine true patriot index he has the second highest in the country he has a
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:24.160]  99 score Ron Paul has a 100 so we're very very excited to have representative
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:28.320]  a congressman John Duncan on with us congressman great to have you well
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.920]  Alex thank you very much it's a real honor to be on with you and I always
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:37.360]  have appreciated the work you've done in the trying to fight against the New
[01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:42.040]  World Order and big government you know big government helps only the
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:49.360]  elitist that and the very very wealthy and you fight for the people that I
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:53.600]  could well I hate to say the little guy but you know what I mean I'm I appreciate
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.480]  the work that you do well we appreciate you how long you've been
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:03.400]  tuning in to the show on WBCR all for many years I know Harry Groth John
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:08.400]  real well I've been on with him many times and I've been on with the he has
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.720]  the power hour I've been on with George Riley a couple of times and and I've
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:19.760]  listened to your show I try never to miss a vote but as soon as we have
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.960]  the last vote of the week I catch the first plane home and I actually end up
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.640]  spending just a little bit more time here in my district in Tennessee than I
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:33.800]  do in Washington and so I do listen to several of the other stations I don't
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:40.040]  want to make any of my other friends mad on but I listened to WBCR regularly
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:44.720]  and I really have enjoyed your program for many years probably ever since
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:51.360]  you've been on here well God bless you sir small world this this TSA situation
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.160]  is is really becoming a focal point not just against the abuse and
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:01.640]  humiliation but overall a focal point for people's anger give us your view on
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:05.640]  that statement and and the fact that every day we learn more now they stick
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:11.240]  the hands in the pants now they're removing people's urology bags
[01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:16.920]  colostomy bags women's artificial breasts from mastectomies I mean this is a
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.320]  federal power grab on so many fronts congressman tell us why you have
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:24.480]  powerfully spoken out against it I mean I know that you're on some of the most
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:28.960]  important committees you were previously the house aviation subcommittee and top
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.240]  Republican on the House subcommittee you'll probably be getting back in as
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.440]  the chairman give us I mean you're a leading expert in this area give us your
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.840]  view on it well I did chair the aviation subcommittee for six years a few years
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.680]  ago when the Republicans had control of the Congress and and we have a rule on
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:49.320]  our side that you can only chair a committee or subcommittee for six
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:53.360]  years but I have been on the aviation subcommittee ever since I've been in
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:59.960]  Congress and that's the now 22 years and and so it's something I'm very much
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:04.400]  interested in I will continue to serve on that subcommittee although I won't be
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.240]  a chairman I'll be chairman in the next Congress of the highways and transit
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:15.160]  subcommittee but I think this the body scanner business it's in these pat
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.280]  bounds I think that I think it's totally ridiculous I think it's
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:24.920]  excessive and I've tried to tell people that if we spend 100% of the federal
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.960]  budget on security we could not make the country totally completely 100% safe so
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:35.440]  we need to have a little balance and common sense and I think we need to
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:39.280]  come to our senses on this I think it's far more about money than it is about
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.360]  the security although I do realize that even though there's a nationwide
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.880]  revolt against this and people are really upset about this they should be I do
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.680]  realize that there probably are half the people who will go along with anything
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.480]  as long as it has the word security attached to it but I think that the
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:02.840]  TSA has gone too far and I will be speaking I've spoken out on the floor
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.960]  about this and of course another thing I've been concerned about almost all
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.800]  these federal contracts are sweetheart insider type deals and I don't like that
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.880]  either and I think that's I think that's present here too well Churtoff as
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.840]  you spoke on the floor Benjamin Churtoff former head of Homeland Security and
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.800]  Alphonse DiMotto and there's also some Democrats involved with the former
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:28.320]  senator he's been all over TV we've played the clips admitting he's making
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.640]  money as a consultant to one company and the head of another division of a
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:37.040]  separate one I mean he's admitted it and then now they put out a press release
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:41.000]  last week saying he's made no money from it I mean should we have congressional
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  hearings about this because this looks like you know classic corruption where
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.360]  the general orders a missile system and then two years later retires and becomes
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.840]  the you know the head of that company where he ordered the missiles well you
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:57.480]  say you've hit on something else that I've been very outspoken about on the
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:02.200]  floor and that is that the defense contractors hire all the retired
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:07.040]  admirals and generals and then they go back and sign on with these big defense
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:12.320]  contractors and go back and get the just ridiculously excessive and expensive
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.760]  contracts for the Pentagon in fact I've said in speeches and in committee
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:20.920]  hearings that I wonder sometimes if there's any conservatives at the Pentagon
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.560]  and I and I can say that even though I believe that national defense is
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.960]  probably the most legitimate function of the federal government but but I still
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:37.280]  hate to see all the waste and and insider dealing that going on in with the
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.400]  Defense Department but that going back to Turtof there's something funny going
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.400]  on there in my opinion because a year ago in November of last year he was on
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.880]  Campbell Brown's show on CNN and he was talking you know he was supporting these
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:59.160]  standards at that time and he didn't mention that he had anything to do with
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.080]  any of the companies until Campbell Brown said well in the interest of full
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:08.640]  disclosure you represent some of these companies and having been caught he
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.520]  then he said absolutely that's correct in other words he admitted after she
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:21.440]  confronted with it and so then there was a story in the Washington Post at the
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.280]  first of this year saying that he had this connection and that and his firm
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.640]  got some kind of a correction I think they said for the headline but not for
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:36.000]  the story so there's been some kind of connection with these companies for the
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.600]  Turtof group and now he's claiming that he never made any money off of it I what
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.880]  he may be trying to say I don't know that his group made some money or some
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:51.160]  other people in his firm but it still looks like a insider type deal to me
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:59.080]  well absolutely speaking about the first point you brought up congressman look
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:03.040]  the borders are wide open ABC News reported two weeks ago that illegal
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:10.280]  aliens can walk in and get a TSA waiver and and have and get to rent aircraft we
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:14.040]  know that hundreds of boats a week are landing in San Diego and on the island
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.200]  off the coast now that's associated press and that the illegal aliens are
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:22.480]  just pouring in on the fishing boats no police no border patrol they could care
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:29.840]  less and you're exactly right and and what I said on that is this we've got
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.040]  plenty of security at the airports right now but there's always companies and
[01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:40.000]  people trying to get more and get you to spend more but I think now these
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.880]  terrorists would probably do something much more spectacular than bringing down
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:47.960]  a plane they probably blow up a mall at Christmas or blow up a major sporting
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:53.880]  event or poison the water supply or that are even boy I blow up a big city
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:58.320]  subway system they kill a lot more people and and I think too we're very
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:03.720]  vulnerable in the cyber security that we're so controlled by all the
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:09.200]  computers and so forth now so you know we just can't do and we can't go
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:13.520]  ridiculously overboard at the airport that's what I'm trying to say I mean are
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:17.800]  we gonna have minimum wage federal employees that are outside the law and
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:25.960]  violate due process I mean I actually big sis Janet Napolitano is actually in
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:35.000]  the news now saying next they want them in malls trains boats buses we already
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.440]  have TSA doing warrantless searches in areas like New York and Boston I mean
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.280]  are we gonna have 50 million TSA workers to guard every 7-11 because I mean a
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.040]  real terrorist I mean that's just the way it is the only answer is to have an
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.600]  armed concealed carry population now you can't put enough police on the streets
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.120]  with machine guns and dogs well you're exactly right and I and I agree with you
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:04.960]  it's a the TSA has become a bloated bureaucracy just a few years ago it
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:12.120]  had 16,500 employees now it's got 61,000 employees and and it's top heavy with
[01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:20.040]  administrators and and top staff people that I understand that on average they
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:25.400]  make a hundred and five thousand a year and and it's just it's just gotten out
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:31.840]  of control and and I hope that a lot more people than me will that will speak
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:39.440]  out on this but in fact and I think they will I'll tell you I was asked on
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:45.160]  television just a few weeks ago what was the biggest change I'd seen in my my
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:50.960]  time in office and I said without any question it's that almost everybody who
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:55.560]  keeps up with this stuff now is is more concerned worried upset angry whatever
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:59.320]  you want to say about the financial condition of the federal government and
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:04.360]  our deaths and our debt and I think more and more people are coming beginning
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:11.560]  to realize that we can't just go crazy in spending a university professor a
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:16.600]  university Pennsylvania professor wrote an article for the Hill newspaper of
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.720]  about a year ago and he said that the war on terror that the spending was now
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.520]  far exceeding the threat and that it had become a major profit center and a
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.640]  funding bonanza for federal and state agencies corporations nonprofit groups
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:36.080]  and so forth in and as I said earlier this is all more about money and power
[01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.400]  than this about any real threat or real security well if this continues we'll
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:48.080]  have to change the American flag to basically an image of a sheep or a
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.920]  ostrich with its head in the sand and we'll have to get rid of the American
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:56.480]  Eagle and replace it with an ostrich I mean since when to the land of the free
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.640]  home of the brave get like this where we're so afraid of men in caves we've
[01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:04.760]  got a better chance from dying from a bee sting or an automobile accident
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:10.120]  hundreds die a year from bees and waft stings and and and I mean it's just so
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.320]  crazy to see the federal government expanding its power but you're a
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:18.120]  congressman you study these issues more than I have I know that the the airlines
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:24.640]  opt in to have the TSA there some airlines are saying and some airports are
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:31.040]  saying they don't want them now but I mean at the end of the day where do you
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:36.480]  see this backlash going and what are your biggest problems congressman with
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:42.720]  what the TSA is doing and isn't this a 10th Amendment violation to have them
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:45.800]  on the streets of America and announcing that they want to expand what
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:51.120]  they're doing well we have expanded all of these federal law enforcement agencies
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:57.640]  far beyond what they should be far beyond what is necessary I mean the FBI I
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:04.080]  mean I have a an uncle whom I love very much who who many many years ago started
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.120]  his career as an FBI agent and then and he was just with them for a few years but
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:16.120]  I'll tell you we've expanded that agency far beyond what's necessary and and
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.400]  most of the real law enforcement work is done by local law enforcement people in
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:26.880]  the in the first place and and I've even said for instance that one agency that
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:31.080]  we should do away with is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and now
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:37.040]  they've added on the word explosives to try to expand their mission but everything
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.600]  that they do is done best by state and local law enforcement people and one
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.680]  expert told me that there's nothing but paper pushers now but I heard you say
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.960]  yesterday that these things analogy and I was very impressed by that I have told
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:55.600]  people that you really are thousands of times many thousands of times more
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:04.560]  likely to be killed on the driving on the high yes then then you are by a
[01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:09.880]  terrorist and I've only the problem we're into is this Alex say it's it's
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:15.560]  almost impossible to get big brother federal government to ever admit making
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:21.040]  a mistake or ever go back on anything and we've got so much we've given so much
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.760]  power in this country to unelected bureaucrats in fact I've said many times
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:30.240]  that today unfortunately we have a government up buying for the bureaucrats
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.960]  than instead of up buying for the people and so it's going to be very hard to get
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:40.840]  them to go back very far on this that they're already squirming though and
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:44.880]  saying well they're going to tweak this a little bit but that I've had other
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:50.880]  concerns about this the radiation factor and you know there are several
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:57.200]  million that frequent flyers who on average that fly twice a week and
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:03.200]  getting full body doses the TSA is trying to say oh well it's not not a
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.440]  lot of it's just a tiny little dose but I'll tell you they give you more
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.160]  protection at the dentist and when I go to the dentist they put a little shield
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:19.920]  over my neck and chest and so forth and this is a full body radiation thing and
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:25.120]  then I think it's the parents have a legitimate concern about not only the
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.440]  radiation but also having unfamiliar people a grope or feel their their
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:35.960]  children in the private type places I think it's terrible well I agree with
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.000]  you congressman and I've had radiologist on the show we've got the
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.720]  New York Times top scientists federal bodies the International Atomic
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:49.440]  Energy Agency have said that these things have 50 times what the TSA claimed a
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.720]  year ago they've been lying and if you look at the images TSA is released to
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:58.440]  give me an idea you can see the hands and you can see the bones in the hands
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:02.360]  and that's exactly what radiologist have told me on and off air is that they've
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:08.960]  looked at the calibrations it's about like a dental skull x-ray it's it's
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:13.880]  it's it's not approaching a chest x-ray but but it but it's close and it's the
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:18.880]  repeated exposure and they've got all these top scientists on record saying
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:24.240]  bare minimum skin cancers and that it'll exacerbate people that are already
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:27.840]  prone to skin cancers what about the TSA workers who are around it all day
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:32.800]  they're not hiding behind any any lead shielding but congressman what about
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.200]  this issue Ron Paul we had him on yesterday and you said you heard it
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.040]  right but but you know I said so you've had enhanced pat down he said yes I said
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.040]  they've touched your crotch he said yes it's disgusting that's on the drugs
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:51.240]  report today the video and audio of that but now the TSA told ABC News maybe
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:58.320]  that goes too far hand in the pants I mean this is insane and now people are
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:03.280]  stripping down their underwear as a protest the TSA is still rubbing their
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:08.160]  skin rubbing their their you know their their kneecaps where they have metal in
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.880]  them to make sure it's really metal I mean this is like the sacrificing our
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:21.360]  liberty on the altar of big government congressman but my issue is that now
[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:26.560]  it's discriminatory because Boehner you know he it's video that on the news he
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:30.920]  gets to go around the checkpoint a lot of other congress people they're not
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.560]  releasing the full list but it's in the AP the White House says they won't
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:40.400]  release who it is but but but now it's if you're a big wig you get a pass but
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.680]  the citizens don't here's the headline TSA some government officials to skip
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:50.080]  airport security a do you get to bypass it and be what's your view of this well
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:54.560]  no I don't get to bypass it and I saw that in the paper myself I hadn't even
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:59.120]  heard that part until I saw that this morning on the news and I assume that
[01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:05.200]  that they're giving a pass to the top cabinet officials and the top
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:10.240]  administration officials and the and the leaders of the House and Senate the
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:16.120]  you know the top five in the house than the top four in the Senate I think that
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:21.720]  that's what it is but nobody if we're if we're gonna have it nobody at the top
[01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:27.680]  level should be given a pass but there's a there's other concerns that they go
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:33.320]  along with that for instance I understand that already people who say
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.920]  they don't want to go through the scanning that some TSA people are
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:42.200]  resentful about having to do that and so they're being almost rude or are
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:47.640]  irritable or hateful in doing no they're rough they're rough they squeeze
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:52.200]  hard that's confirmed right and then then I have this concern also that the
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:52:01.480]  plans are right now to purchase a 1800 of these scanners by various departments
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:09.080]  and agencies by the year 2014 and what I can see coming is that they'll buy they'll
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:12.520]  end up buying several thousand of these things and wanting to put them in all the
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:19.120]  federal buildings for when you go in you know any federal building and all these
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:23.240]  department agencies they all want to get all this the latest the gizmos and so
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:28.000]  forth but there is one good thing that may come out of this hopefully and it
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.760]  would be that that number one that people that morpheal would begin to realize
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:37.240]  that just because the word security is mentioned doesn't mean that it's
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:43.200]  necessary or that it's good or that's not excessive or intrusive and and and
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.280]  morpheal will begin to question these things and then also maybe hopefully
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:53.840]  some of these bureaucracies will be a little bit slower to purchase a great
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:59.680]  many of these machines but I just think it's you know we've got this be a
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.800]  leadest out of control federal government now and it's totally opposite from
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:10.040]  what our founding fathers thought the way things should be they thought that we
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.120]  should solve most of our problems through the through the private free
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.960]  enterprise system and then go to government only for a few things and
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.440]  first of the local government then to the state government then have the
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.080]  federal government was meant to be only a government of the last resort with
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:29.120]  very few and very limited powers but what we've done in the last few years has
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:34.080]  turned the federal government into a government of first resort that we run
[01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:38.480]  to for almost everything and it's just not working absolutely representative
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.160]  John Duncan is our guest amazing and he's there from the Knoxville area with
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:49.280]  his district in Tennessee and go to the house site and of course visit his site
[01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:53.000]  and read his writings and ideas are there any other websites congressmen that
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:00.840]  people can visit well no they can they can visit to my website but and I you
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:05.640]  know I speak out on these things that all the time and and like I said I
[01:54:05.640 --> 01:54:10.160]  certainly admire and respect the the work that you're doing too because it's
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:15.400]  going to take you know it's going to be very difficult to turn this monster
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:21.400]  around and and but we sure need to do so when you're talking about us facing a
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:27.400]  national debt of over $14 trillion which is a mind-boggling figure but what it
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:31.240]  means is it's an incomprehensible figure but it means that it's not gonna be long
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.280]  at all before we're not gonna be able to pay all our social security and better
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:38.120]  expensive things we promised our own people absolutely sir we're almost out
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:42.280]  of time and will you promise to come back in the next few months yes I'll be
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:46.440]  be glad to I'm honored to be on here with you and and I'll keep listening to
[01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.440]  you every chance I have well we've got about five minutes left with you
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.840]  congressman I want to finish up on the eve of Thanksgiving we appreciate you
[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:56.320]  joining us in your great record of promoting liberty in the House of
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:02.120]  Representatives talking about the new world order you know Ron Paul myself you
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.840]  and others have been demonized over the years for being informed reading you in
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:11.880]  documents knowing about the CFR now it's world government new global taxes
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:18.120]  carbon taxes to be paid to this SDR we see the private central banks imploding
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:21.880]  countries I do see a really big awakening what's your message to the
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:25.720]  American people about this global government and and and what's your view
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:29.280]  on where we're going I mean I believe we're starting to turn the corner and
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:33.880]  that real issues are starting to get on the table well I'm so glad that you
[01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:39.000]  brought that up because I mean now we're seeing the the bailout that's having to
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.640]  be put together for Ireland then and earlier a few months ago we had to do
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:50.240]  one for Greece and and the American taxpayers are paying a lot of this
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:55.320]  bailout don't even realize it because the big portions of these bailouts are
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:58.440]  being paid through the International Monetary Fund sometimes we pay more
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:02.360]  than half as you know yeah we shouldn't even be in in the first place but that
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:09.240]  we see we see a Greece and Ireland and they and they on the NPR I listen even
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.000]  to NPR and this morning they were interviewing a couple of people from
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.160]  Portugal because they think they're next Spain is next we look around at the
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:23.560]  we see what's happening in California and you can see what coming you know it
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.360]  doesn't take a genius to see the problems that were headed into it we've
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:31.800]  got to start saying no to these bankers that's right and our children and
[01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:35.560]  grandchildren are going to face problems that the so severe that we couldn't we
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.520]  can't even imagine if we don't turn this thing around and and you talk about
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:46.320]  the the new world order I remember when they found out that I was leaning against
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:51.280]  the war in Iraq they had they come to Lisa Rice and George Tennant the head of
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.280]  the CIA and John McLaughlin his deputy director they had me and five others down
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.240]  to a little secure room at the White House and I told them at that time I
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.720]  said that I said there was a there was a front-page story in the worst
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:10.400]  and post Lawrence Lindsay the president's chief economics advisor had said that
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.640]  day that a war with Iraq would cost a hundred to two hundred billion and they
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.840]  fired him because of it and I asked him please arise about that she said oh no
[01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:21.840]  it wouldn't cost more than 50 or 60 billion and then we get some of that
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:27.160]  back from the our allies and how wrong she was about that but I asked them that
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.160]  day I said if you can get past the traditional conservative position of
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:35.560]  being against massive foreign aid and the traditional conservative position of
[01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:40.560]  being against huge deficit spending and and they and against the traditional
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.320]  conservative position of being the biggest critics of the UN and we were
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:49.040]  going to warrant and force UN resolution I said if you get past all those
[01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:53.000]  traditional conservative positions is there any evidence of any imminent
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.960]  threat and they didn't have any and what I'm trying to get across to you is that
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:04.760]  these things have been totally opposite or totally against all traditional
[01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:11.080]  conservative positions and yet we've had many too many Republicans in the
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:14.920]  Congress good friends of mine who've been supporting some of this stuff but
[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:20.280]  hopefully with the Tea Party and and the opposition that's popped up here in the
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:25.040]  last few months maybe hopefully we've got more people realizing that that we've
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:31.080]  got to do differently than we did when we had control it during that 12 years
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:35.400]  congressman I know you've got to go we've got a one-minute break let me just

[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:12.920]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:20.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:23.920]  Alex Jones
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:31.880]  well he hails from the second district of Tennessee one of our oldest affiliates
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:39.600]  not even be a 12 years we've been on it that's the great station WBCR and of
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.040]  course he's representative John Duncan he's got to go he's got a lot of work to
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.000]  do he's promised to come back again soon but you were intriguing me with the last
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.920]  point you were making because that was on my list of questions I hadn't got to
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:56.200]  well you know as somebody who does score with the new American magazine who I
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.880]  really respect with a 99 the second highest in Congress Ron Paul has a
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.760]  hundred there's one guy under you with a 95 but I mean you really I mean let's
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:09.440]  see if Rand can even get close to you and we're certainly hoping that's the
[02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:15.040]  case but but looking at this new crop of house members and senators and where the
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:19.240]  tea party's going you know you know my my point is congressman I see it as a
[02:01:19.240 --> 02:01:25.200]  victory regardless because now issues of world government issues of mega
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.440]  corporations wanting socialism issues of rhino republicans all these things
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.520]  they've tried to demonize and make fun of is hokey that's now the vanguard at
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:38.440]  least on the surface of Sarah pale and all these people and and and and blend
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.520]  back they've at least got to take on our mantle of real patriots that shows
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.200]  we're winning the intellectual battle we're now identifying the private
[02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.840]  fellow reserve so I briefly wanted to just in two or three minutes get your
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.920]  view congressman and closing on your prognosis of what you see with this new
[02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:58.680]  crop of tea party people and this fight for the heart and soul of real
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:02.320]  conservatism that we haven't really seen since the days of Barry Goldwater
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:08.520]  well I'm hopeful that we can do a lot more the the Democrats started the last
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:12.520]  congress with an 81 feet majority and when you have an 81 feet majority on
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:17.440]  the other side you lose almost every key vote but I've been speaking out for
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.560]  years against this big government big business duopoly that's been running
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:27.440]  this country that benefited just a very few people at the top and in fact what
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:31.680]  I've said for years the only thing extremely big government is good at is
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.520]  slowly wiping out the middle class and you can see that all over the world and
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:41.160]  so that's what I'm concerned about and and I'm especially concerned about the
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:47.560]  loss of all the private property in this country of particularly through these
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.880]  land trusts and nature conservancies that I could talk to you about that
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.360]  sometime too because agenda 21 how do we fight that yes sir well I'll tell you
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:02.520]  what people have got to I hope wake up and realize that if you if you do away
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.040]  with the private property that you're doing away not only with a very
[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:11.480]  important part of our freedom but also a very important part of our prosperity
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:18.400]  and and also we keep taking property more and more property off the tax rolls
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:22.320]  at the same time the schools and the police and so forth are coming to us
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.760]  that wanting increased funding and that just it just doesn't work I mean the
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.320]  federal government now owns or controls over 30% of the land in this country and
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.920]  state and local governments and quasi-governmental agencies on another
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.360]  or control another 20% so you've got half the land at some type of public
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.960]  ownership and that's a problem I guess we can talk about on another day but
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.800]  what's your view of the of the new crop of congressman well my view is is that
[02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:55.880]  it's going to be much better the only thing the new leadership
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:01.880]  in the in the house that said their goal is to try to cut 100 billion and
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:07.120]  maybe that's the best we can do at this point but if you think about it 100
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:11.520]  billion when we've got a death that when we've got a national death that will
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:16.440]  reach 14 trillion 300 billion this spring it's sort of just a drop in the
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:22.400]  bucket but we need to do as much as we can and you know we had that 862
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:27.920]  billion dollar stimulus package that didn't work a CNN poll said only 7% of
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:32.200]  the American bill felt it had helped them but the reason was almost all of it
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:37.720]  first of all 41 or 42 percent had to be borrowed and then most of it went to
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:41.000]  federal agencies the Washington Post said it was gonna be a massive windfall
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.880]  for federal agencies and then the state agencies where government spends money
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:49.720]  the least absolutely this way possible but thank you for having me on it's been

[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:20.200]  well it's the eve of Thanksgiving giving thanks for our free republic I'm
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.080]  very excited about the TSA situation because it's showing people that they
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:28.600]  can get together get angry and have an effect there are record numbers of people
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.760]  not flying AAA reports that's making the system very mad so they're running a
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:37.840]  spin that nobody's angry this isn't a story we're not putting our hands down
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.240]  your pants there is no radiation and we've got this latest article up at
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:47.640]  prisonplanet.com I tell you Paul Watson is just on fire over there big sis
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:55.120]  once behavior scanners at sporting events and malls and she's also announced
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:58.440]  she wants TSA checkpoints they've already been beta testing it I told you it was
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:06.200]  coming now it's all over the news DHS seeks to read mal-tent at interrogation
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:13.320]  checkpoints now they just had one of these behavior experts as they're
[02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:18.560]  called that's in the Atlanta Journal Constitution accused of kidnapping a
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:26.680]  woman and they did get to his house and catching and he is a behavior detection
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:30.520]  officer so I guess they'll take the people that think they're God or beat on
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:35.080]  their chest and say I have power or a TSA employee based in Atlanta's Hartfield
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:38.600]  Jackson International Airport tried to kill himself after allegedly abducting a
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:43.520]  woman sexually assaulting her then giving her a suicide note she was in the
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.960]  little outfit that he'd put her in and had the what do they call it here they
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:52.880]  called the leopard pattern novelty handcuffs where the sexual assault
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.920]  occurred she escaped to the police department with a note from him saying
[02:09:57.920 --> 02:10:04.840]  he was going to commit suicide and I mean I'm not kidding it says a the bound
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:09.960]  woman who was still bound in leopard print novelty handcuffs so I guess this
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:13.960]  guy isn't a God though or he'd be getting away with this so that's the new
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:19.160]  behavior controllers we're gonna have big sis once behavior scanners at
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:23.520]  sporting events malls and of course they're also rolling out the 500 mobile
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:26.600]  scanners looking through your walls and they have the National Guard out
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:31.360]  affecting 2000 plus arrest in New York State alone that's Fox News driving
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:34.840]  people under scanners while they're in it but you know the government just waves
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.240]  a magic pixie dust wand like a tooth fairy and says there's no radiation here
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:43.360]  everything's fine you don't need a parachute to jump out of an airplane now
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.660]  we say so you don't need water to live in the desert you know you'll live
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:52.640]  forever we're the government we say so look we hired obese goons to stick their
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:57.240]  hands down your pants we say so homeland security chief Janet Napolitano
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:01.200]  admitted yesterday that body scanners would eventually find their way into
[02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:08.760]  US public transport trains and boats big sis is already trailing technology that
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.560]  goes even further now I guess that's a British term sometimes he puts British
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:19.440]  isms in these articles I understand big sis is already trailing technology we
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:24.920]  might want to call Watson have him change that to testing because I don't
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.480]  really get it you know Ron Paul is not only an economist Ron Paul is not only
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:38.000]  a doctor Ron Paul is not only a baseball player Ron Paul is also a spell
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.120]  checker and English teacher we got a nice email this morning thanking us for
[02:11:42.120 --> 02:11:46.440]  the article about Ron Paul being groped that's on drudge he's very angry about
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:54.600]  them groping him but telling us that proper English is rain in R E I in or
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:12:00.960]  how do you spell it versus rain with a G which means raining so Ron Paul is now
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:06.400]  spell checking or doing the doing the English on our articles as well that guy
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:13.000]  literally works 18 hours a day folks no exaggeration he's 75 now isn't he I mean
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.720]  how does how does Ron Paul do this like let me actually go to my article and
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:23.800]  I'll show you what he is spell checked also watching an article about this guy
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:27.360]  you know basically saying down with big sis on his back and stripping down to
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:31.120]  speedos and they're telling him put your shirt back on well you're about to see
[02:12:31.120 --> 02:12:35.800]  me neck it anyways see that's about people taking power and then taking
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:42.680]  control back over their lives by but by illustrating the absurdity of them
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:46.640]  naked body scanning you and groping you it's a lot less absurd to just strip down
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.640]  into your underwear and then they still will pat you down even if you insist
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:57.280]  they're so crazy that they're letting people do that oh yes grip down yeah we
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:04.360]  had the rain like a reigning king in there and it's actually R E I in his
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:11.240]  quote and insist we rain in the TSA oh man you know it's crazy when Ron Paul's
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:16.480]  spell checking our English is like our English teacher now I just you got to
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.560]  admit that's funny maybe now that Ron Paul has noticed these top but you know
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:23.240]  what our writers are awesome they're writing so many articles with so much
[02:13:23.240 --> 02:13:27.880]  key info you're gonna have stuff like that in there but I don't get big sis
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.160]  is already trailing technology that goes even further by forcing Americans to
[02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:36.000]  undergo a behavioral interrogation before they're allowed to enter sporting
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.920]  events rock concerts and shopping malls they've already ordered hundreds of
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:44.040]  these giant mobile 18 wheeler truck trailers with brain scanners and body
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.680]  scanners they have meant rolling out and it says to get in a concert or a
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:54.400]  football game again this is a joke you know I got invited out to KSCO great
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:59.440]  station out in Santa Cruz and they said what kind of security one I said one
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:07.320]  cop and then they said well the police don't don't don't don't don't don't get
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:11.040]  paid here in Santa Cruz so then the police still showed up the sheriff's
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:14.280]  department a bunch of security and they they wanted to do pat downs for people
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:18.400]  going in they were real nice I was like please don't do this like we must do it
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:22.840]  we must do it for your safety and and and you know what I was like no do not do
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:27.720]  it do not do it I do not want them to be patted down I do not I want to live
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:33.040]  free outside of fear you can't protect me I had a much better chance of dying
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.160]  driving around on those windy roads from northern California where I was up
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:42.040]  there doing an investigation in the days before I gave the speech almost had
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:46.200]  probably 15 head-on collisions in the rain and the wind the highway were having
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.920]  bad weather while I was there driving down these windy roads with cars coming
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.360]  out of their lanes I mean you have a TSA guy there you know standing in the
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:58.560]  middle of the lane to make sure I don't wreck I mean the world is dangerous anyways
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:02.080]  they were great folks I'm not complaining the point is I'm playing about the radio
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:05.680]  station was complaining about 20 cops to protect me and I feel like I was the
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:09.680]  president and grabbing me and carrying me in you know up to the podium each time
[02:15:09.680 --> 02:15:14.080]  was having to hide I'd try to go to the bathroom they'd be following me I mean a
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:19.440]  lot of more fans but it's just just just just crazy I want freedom okay I mean I
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:23.000]  don't need a TSA person in my pants to keep me safe literally government in
[02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.800]  your pants but this is an incredible article I think the tighter we get on
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:31.720]  aviation we have to also be thinking about going on to mass transit or the
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:36.160]  trains or maritime so that we do need to be doing to strengthen our protections
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.600]  theirs in the Palatano and pistol the head of TSA said the same thing
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:43.520]  mobile x-ray scanners have already hit the streets with more than 500 backscatter
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:47.440]  x-ray scanners he just goes through it all I mean you think they're gonna stop
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.520]  with pulling your colosal bag off or pulling your artificial breast off from
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:55.360]  breast cancer or sticking their hands in your sutures or groping your two-year-old
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:59.440]  there that's the beginning they want to take your blood to get a driver's
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:02.320]  license they want to take your blood at checkpoints they take your baby's blood
[02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:06.360]  for 39 years at birth I want to come back in the next segment jam a few calls
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:09.840]  and Webster Tarp was coming on about all of this but I wanted to bring Ted
[02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:13.600]  Anderson up briefly golds basically holding steady where it was yesterday
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:17.200]  going way up and I just want to encourage people with all that's happening in
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:21.760]  the economy to get involved in gold and silver today here's the headline of the
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:25.680]  China daily that's one of the basically government mouthpiece China Russia quit
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.200]  dollar all their business with each other is now not gonna be in the dollar
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:33.320]  the world is going away from the dollar because the Federal Reserve that runs us
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:37.640]  is devaluing it and they know and are upset Ted what does this mean to have
[02:16:37.640 --> 02:16:41.560]  China and Russia announced they are leaving the dollar now well what it means
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:45.160]  is that there's a lot of reserves over in Russia and China that will be leaving
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:49.840]  those countries they'll have to sell away the US dollar and buy you know back a
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:53.440]  currency that's more hard and something that they can trade with or their own
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.640]  currencies and and the only reason why the dollar has been able to last this
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:17:03.000]  long is because China and places like China have been buying US treasuries and
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.880]  using the US dollar as a world currency that you can trade internationally
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:12.120]  people would always run to the dollar for security and safety it was like the
[02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:16.480]  gold standard of all the currencies in the world and now everybody's looking at
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.120]  the United States dollar like it says dying you know Goliath that's just you
[02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:25.520]  know laying over and just you know if you let you know it's like it has cancer
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.600]  that's just died they want to get away from it bottom line they do not want to
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.680]  own the US dollar unfortunately us here who have our investments in stocks bonds
[02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:38.720]  annuities everything else that is a denominated in dollar is going to watch
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:42.840]  that go into the toilet along with it all you know that's it just it makes me
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:47.280]  just so infuriated when I hear this and I read it and because I'm reading the
[02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:51.200]  same stuff you are we were the number one superpower of the world and still
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:57.360]  should be but if I but this this nation has taken the wrong turn in 1913 went to
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:02.600]  a fiat printing system in 1971 and the thing has done nothing but go into the
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:09.920]  toilet this this this this era of us living on a gold standard is done people
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:13.400]  know that the United States dollar does you know we were just not credible
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:18.080]  anymore that's it that's a that's a just a quite a hit for us to take here in the
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:21.920]  United States we shouldn't stand for it our politicians should be hung out to
[02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:26.360]  dry for this one and certainly the Federal Reserve system as well I just it

[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.080]  congressman yeah he's a great guy congressman I'm sorry yes sir I just
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:40.920]  wanted to give you a quick tip and all your listeners about you know how you
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.400]  been talking about the unhygienic mix of the you know they're using the same
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:51.520]  gloves to check everybody well my grandma just died of MRSA and people
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.360]  don't realize how serious MRSA is that's right much worse than than than
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:03.000]  crabs or or or things like that is flesh-eating bacteria yes and she not
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.520]  only that but my my my father was actually taking care of her and now he's
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:12.520]  got it it's that contagious I mean he he's pretty you know try to take care of
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:15.800]  himself that when you know this is a point I've made for months and asked our
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:19.080]  great writers to do stories on the world that daily did it and finally it's
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:24.000]  getting attention but we need a story about MRSA flesh-eating bacteria you
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.840]  know it's being spread by the airports and a story in the same article about
[02:25:27.840 --> 02:25:31.640]  taking your shoes off where thousands of people are from all over the world
[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:37.000]  picking up all of their bacteria and all of their fungus this is disgusting and
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.600]  the government who always obsesses during flu season about washing your hands
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.280]  and all this they're not spraying stuff on the floor they're not mopping it
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:50.960]  every time because they don't care it's a disease factory exactly and it's so
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.960]  serious that right now my my father's trying to find some help that I mean
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.960]  even the doctors are you know kind of trying to downplay it to not scare the
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:04.360]  public but I mean I can see the headline now is flesh-eating bacteria being
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:08.240]  spread through airports then you show the statistics of record numbers of
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:12.560]  flesh-eating bacteria spreading then you point out the bacteria and fungus from
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:16.480]  from where thousands walk through from all over the world in the dirty airport
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:21.880]  I mean it just goes on and on and then them going and then you take the quotes
[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:26.240]  with the TSA talking about going under the fat rolls and all of the dead skin
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:32.120]  and and toe cheese that's under there and they have whatever term you use for
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:36.640]  that the detritus and they're just smearing it all over I mean this is
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:41.360]  disgusting it really is well I just wanted to get people that tip and just
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:45.480]  just be sure that when you go you better bring some kind of silver or oil of
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:49.400]  oregano or something but the other point I wanted to make was that I called last
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.920]  week about having the info warriors call into Saturday programs to reach a
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:59.960]  targeted audience they've got Richard Land he's got a program on Saturdays and
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:02.960]  I know it's a small program but he's pretty big in the Southern Baptist
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.200]  Convention and that guy for years I've listened to him every Saturday and he's
[02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:11.480]  such a bush botter he was but I'm telling you he went through the pat downs at
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:17.360]  the TSA and that guy has came around he admitted on air and I called in there's
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:20.520]  nothing like having having some guys take his hand down your pants to make you
[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:26.200]  angry exactly and so I took my own advice so I called into a show and I was
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:30.560]  able to talk to that guy without being cut off no I agree people should hit the
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  regional shows the specialty shows and reach millions good points good job
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:40.360]  there Noah let's go ahead and go to some more calls here let's talk to George and
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:45.320]  Connecticut George are on the air hi Alex I put up another way of upping the
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.320]  ante for these characters why not use every opportunity that that people have
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:53.760]  to go to the airport at that basically handing out flyers while you're in those
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.360]  lines and everything that not only to the passengers about the dangers the
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.960]  actual scientific dangers of the scanners and and the biological
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:06.040]  possibilities of contracting whatever the heck you you want to your list but
[02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:11.200]  also to the to the actual TSA guys they look guys you're more vulnerable than
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.640]  we are you're you're your hands are all over the place you you just because of
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.440]  rubber gloves because you're next to the scanners drive them crazy and then one
[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:23.960]  other thing take-at-home demonstrations for the private jets at the airport good
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:29.360]  example Westchester Airport right on the borderline where all of the Soros and
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.400]  and Clinton and all these guys fly out of because it's right on the border
[02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:38.600]  that's right turtles lives right there yeah yeah and they both live in the
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  Bedford just above Greenwich so I mean the Beverly Hills of our area anyway if
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:47.520]  you hit that airport they look why is it that we're not we have to go through
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:52.120]  this crap and they do now these story princes who are funded this stuff they
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:55.320]  could fly in one of their private jets with bombs and everything like that and
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:28:58.840]  blow up the whole friggin airport I mean what the sense of doing this exactly
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:04.080]  expose the hypocrisy expose the fraud we beat them on this issue we beat them on
[02:29:04.080 --> 02:29:09.800]  all the issues that if they can sell this absurdity the sky is the limit great
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:15.480]  points I appreciate your call George I want to say this right now about this
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:22.960]  whole situation and what we have going on with the TSA and I've said it before
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:27.200]  and I'll say it again this is the big fight this is a lot bigger than just the
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:32.320]  TSA it's about out-of-control federalization it's about being
[02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:36.680]  radiated it's about the government violating your space it's about them
[02:29:36.680 --> 02:29:43.720]  selling absurdity and creating a pretext to totally take over our society and I
[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:47.280]  got a laundry list of other points but it's a circus out there today and I've
[02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:50.360]  got something else key I want to say about TSA when we come back stay with

[02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:08.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:12.840]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:16.880]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:20.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:25.040]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:29.200]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:33.520]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:37.240]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:51.000]  that is the TSA molestation as they try to impart this mass mental illness of
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:55.200]  paranoia that there are all these terrorists wanting to get us so they
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:59.800]  can then set the precedent to put TSA into every airport every bus terminal
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:04.840]  every train station every highway every mall every school it's all being announced
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:10.680]  they're gonna be everywhere as we warned you big sis is now laying it out but I
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:15.320]  wanted to make this point before we go to Tarpley there's all these articles out
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:20.920]  today airport security moving smoothly despite opt-out day and the message is
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:25.800]  you failed people aren't trying to slow down the airports some have said that's
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:30.640]  their goal the goal is to say no and not use your machines but it's not just
[02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:35.720]  opt-out we're saying don't put your hands on our genitals then it's oh we'll try to
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:39.760]  charge you eleven thousand dollars that's if you leave the area so you sit
[02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:43.440]  there and you argue with them you come two hours early you educate them you
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:48.400]  resist Fox News all of them were like oh go ahead and submit don't slow down the
[02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:54.360]  airports NBC says 98% in the poll love it but other polls that are scientific
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:01.040]  show 61 72 96% against on the street it's got to be 90% against it what I'm
[02:35:01.040 --> 02:35:05.600]  saying so there's this hoax because they know if they can make you submit to
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:12.720]  this they can do anything now already in El Paso a few months ago they said
[02:35:12.720 --> 02:35:16.160]  everyone will be put to the naked body scanners the TSA and Mrs. Chicago
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:23.040]  Tribune they plan on making everyone do it and so yes during big peak times they
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.840]  always open up the regular lanes and don't put everybody through the
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:30.840]  scanners most the airports don't have them yet Austin gets theirs next month
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.000]  and I ain't going through and nobody's putting their hands on my genitals got
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:41.560]  it I'm not a terrorist your bosses that run this country stage the terror attacks

[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:14.560]  upcoming eugenics film and Webster Griffin tarpley I wanted to get him on on
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:19.880]  China announcing in their big Chinese daily china daily dot com China Russia
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:24.760]  yesterday agreed to quit the dollar in all their inter-country transactions with
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:29.440]  each other we've got the North Korean situation which looks like a provocation
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:33.240]  on my end I'm not defending North Korea they're monsters but well let's get
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.520]  tarpley's view on this and then the TSA Webster good to have you here with us
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:42.160]  thank you Alex let me maybe I could just say first concerning this this circus as
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:46.080]  you say in the in the airports just to two facts to remember that might have
[02:39:46.080 --> 02:39:50.640]  gotten gotten lost after all these months you remember a couple of days
[02:39:50.640 --> 02:39:57.280]  after Mutala was napped on Christmas Day we had this guy Richard Wolf this
[02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:02.520]  if he'd British fellow who talks to Obermann on MSNBC and he came out and
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:08.400]  said my sources in the White House tell me that this incident was deliberately
[02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:12.880]  created and then he said we think to make Obama look bad but the heart the
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:17.600]  heart of the analysis was correct the incident was deliberately created and
[02:40:17.600 --> 02:40:24.080]  that was on MSNBC cable news within a week or ten days after the incident had
[02:40:24.080 --> 02:40:28.320]  occurred and then of course it was covered up but there was a moment where
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:32.680]  the even the Obama White House realized that the rogue network had created this
[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:38.520]  the second thing is in actual hearings in front of a house committee Patrick
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:45.000]  Kennedy the deputy secretary of state for consular affairs for visas said that
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.600]  there was an interagency task force meeting and the State Department had
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:54.280]  come forward and said we've given a visa to Mutala but we'd like to revoke it we
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:41:00.080]  want to take it away from him because he's now in Yemen and he's going to
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:05.040]  different terror camps and so forth so we want to take the visa away and the
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:11.120]  answer came from an unnamed agency still unnamed as far as I know saying no no
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:16.360]  don't touch him we've got eyes on him we're following him he's a little fish
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:20.560]  he'll lead us to the big fish it's essential that you not take his visa
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.200]  away of course if you if you took the guy's visa away he couldn't get on the
[02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:29.800]  plane and therefore no incident no circus no hysteria and no opportunity for
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:34.480]  Chertoff to go on television and say now it's time for these full-body
[02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:41.160]  scanners and so forth so this was a manufactured incident and people should
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.760]  remember this that there was there's no basis for what they're doing we don't
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:50.920]  need body scanners we need more detectors we've got to have more detectors
[02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.400]  installed at the FBI and the National Security Agency and the National
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:00.280]  Security Council and throughout the government right more detectors to know
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:05.400]  if people are actually government officials trying to do a job or whether
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.880]  they're loyal to some shadowy rogue network going back to God knows what to
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.520]  9-11 to the Kennedy assassination the Gulf of Tonkin and all the other things
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:18.960]  that we've seen over the past decade
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:29.400]  well Webster where do you see all of this going well it's again we we we
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:35.440]  got we look back to the 1930s you can see this this three phase process like
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:41.760]  depression economic depression followed by dictatorship followed by world war
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:46.200]  and then the big problem we have right now is we're in the depression phase but
[02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:51.600]  we can see the dictatorship elements gathering and becoming stronger in the
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:56.040]  society the problem in that is once you get into the dictatorship phase it's
[02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:00.640]  almost impossible to stop the third phase which is the world war phase
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:04.920]  because that's where it it ultimately leads the political forces that could
[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.760]  have stopped World War two had been destroyed in places like Germany and
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:13.560]  Italy during the dictatorship phase so I think the the ultimate thing is the
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:17.160]  the only way to fight this is you've got to get out of the depression you've got
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:22.080]  to have a broad-based economic recovery a return to full employment a return to
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:26.560]  prosperity a return to expanding standards of living is if you don't do
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:31.640]  that the forces in the society pushing towards police states become overwhelming
[02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:37.360]  just what just one example we got this fraud closure crisis going on talk
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:41.160]  about the sanctity of private property yeah there should be that and there
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:44.920]  should be the rule of law but right now we have a zombie banker can come with
[02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:50.280]  fake paperwork and and essentially steal your house with the help of a robo
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:54.520]  judge and a robo signer and a bunch of I mean that's the issue is that there's
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:59.120]  almost in history in these cycles of time when the ruling class just goes
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:04.040]  insane higher secret police to stick their hands down your pants and train
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:08.360]  you to submit started with the Nazi Singh papers please and ended with women
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:11.960]  and children stripped being marched into holes and their heads being blown off
[02:44:11.960 --> 02:44:18.920]  you know into pits and it you know banks just stealing everything taxes going up
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:24.120]  look at Ireland you know they're now openly saying we want foreign banks to
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:27.200]  run Ireland that's the best way so the banks that have engineered their
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:33.160]  collapse are now being praised as a solution economic conquest is sold as
[02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:39.240]  if it's some type of wonderful thing and no one stops the crazy elites and then
[02:44:39.240 --> 02:44:45.440]  they're just going to drive us into a Hutzpah or arrogance or bravada filled
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:50.000]  World War three I mean I guess that's it certainly in the case of Ireland if
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.360]  you have a government that comes forward with an austerity plan that that
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:59.480]  consciously and deliberately says they're going to destroy 12% of the
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:05.240]  gross national product of Ireland in the year 2011 just to be clear they say
[02:45:05.240 --> 02:45:08.640]  we're going into receivership to foreign banks that was in Reuters with
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:12.920]  government officials saying we believe foreign banks should run us I mean this
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.760]  is now just brazen we are sellouts we are tyrants and the banks that are
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:20.840]  taking over are the ones that engineered it I mean that's why they were
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:25.760]  brought into the EU so they could do this raping and next is Portugal next to
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:31.880]  Spain then England then then France then Germany correct Webster yes certainly
[02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:36.920]  and the thing though is that the forces that resist this need a program for
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:41.680]  example today in Portugal we have reportedly the biggest labor action the
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:47.160]  biggest general strike in 20 years in Portugal against the idea that in a
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.320]  Greek or Irish style austerity plan will come to them the problem is that the
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:56.360]  people who lead this are the forces of the second international the socialist
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:46:02.440]  international that means Papandreou in Greece socialist socrates in Portugal
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:07.880]  another so-called socialist and then and Zapatero in in Spain and the demands
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:13.720]  that they make are absolutely inadequate you look at the Irish austerity plan
[02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:19.160]  they want to have the minimum wage reduced for the average person they want
[02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:24.520]  to have the sales tax go from 21 to 23 percent where's the tax on the banks
[02:46:24.520 --> 02:46:29.840]  where's the wall speed sales tax where's the Tobin tax the turnover tax the way
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:34.440]  to make the banks pay for the crisis that they have themselves created and
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:38.200]  where's it we're above all in the case of Ireland you've got three banks three
[02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:42.760]  zombie banks that are dragging the country down into absolute ruin
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:48.040]  destitution and I would have to say genocide we're so what sir I want to
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:51.880]  get back into North Korea I want to get back into TSA I want to get back into
[02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:55.920]  all this but specifically where do you see this going and this is clearly an
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:01.720]  and an acceleration of the degeneration towards total global
[02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:08.920]  depression as the banks that control the US continue devaluing the currency then
[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:12.680]  blaming China and Russia for getting concerned and now China and Russia say
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:17.280]  when we sell oil or gas to each other when we sell rare minerals from China
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:21.080]  that they mine worldwide Australia and Africa that they have the biggest 90
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.760]  plus percent of the production of now that was a good strategic move that when
[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.760]  they sell finished goods to Russia it's going to be in their own currencies now
[02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:34.560]  or it's going to be in gold or it's going to be in in in SDRs I mean is this
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:41.880]  not a big signpost we just passed that Putin and the Chinese Premier just
[02:47:41.880 --> 02:47:45.560]  signed this deal yesterday certainly the the idea that the dollar is
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:51.000]  indispensable for transfers between between China and Russia it's absurd
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:56.240]  right you'd also wonder if Russia is selling selling oil to the European
[02:47:56.240 --> 02:48:00.160]  Union why does the why does the dollar get into that one either this stuff is
[02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:05.720]  all obsolete and it's absurd but the where it goes is if you don't stop the
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:11.280]  depression there's no civil liberties argument or how can I say anti
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:15.960]  dictatorship argument that works as long as you have a depression and math
[02:48:15.960 --> 02:48:21.200]  unemployment going on you need to have programmatic fight against this kind of
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:24.200]  or no I know webster every time you come on no matter what issue it is we always
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:27.560]  appreciate it you go back to solutions we've covered them I mean we know your
[02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:31.400]  ideas to fix this I mean the thing is you're saying don't drive the bus off
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:34.800]  the cliff the bus has already gone off the cliff they're not listening to you
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:39.200]  in fact they're accelerating what is going to cause the destruction so so
[02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:43.360]  what do we do about that I mean we demonize the bankers because they
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:47.800]  deserve it and we and we expose them in the court of public opinion so people
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:52.160]  know who is the author of our ruin I think that's the most important thing to
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:56.800]  do certainly but you've got to have a program to get out of it and then people
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:00.960]  have to become politically aware and so you like Obama's idea of a national
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:05.960]  train but the national train well no I mean he wants this coast-to-coast you
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:10.160]  know speed bullet train and listen this this idea was there the idea has been
[02:49:10.160 --> 02:49:13.480]  there long before Obama and the question is how do you pay for it look
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:18.880]  Bernanke says six hundred billion dollars of quantitative easing six hundred
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:22.960]  billion dollars I think common dear that money and that's your down payment on
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:27.440]  a hundred thousand miles of fast rail and maglev and this this this has got
[02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:32.200]  nothing to do with Obama Obama's a big faker Obama brings this up when we he
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.600]  can't do it anymore right if he was going to do it why didn't he do it in the
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:39.600]  first couple of weeks that if you started to build a hundred thousand miles of
[02:49:39.600 --> 02:49:43.480]  maglev and fast rail you'd have an economic recovery and people would be
[02:49:43.480 --> 02:49:46.840]  able to point to that in their communities all over the United States and
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.320]  of course the people doing this would be private sector contractors it would
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:56.320]  revive construction engineering steel production rolling stock a whole series
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:00.120]  of industries would now be no I know that that's why I raised the point but
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  they're not doing that from that you know classical you know infrastructure
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.840]  Americana perspective China is doing that the elites have decided to basically
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:16.320]  suck this country dry demonize us for all of their exploits and leave us
[02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:21.800]  holding the bag you know so again how does this North Korea thing tie into it
[02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:26.000]  all right now this I think this is pretty pretty obvious that it this is the
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:31.680]  kind of circus we've seen again and again and again the occasion for this is
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:38.000]  this maneuver which is held periodically called hook hook HOG UK stay there
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.280]  final segment come back and get in North Korea because now they're sending a US
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:45.400]  carrier they're saying they're gonna do drills basically in the same area trying
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:49.920]  to get a provocation from the lunatics in North Korea proxies for the chai

[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:12.680]  what's been great about this country and people that have fought and stood up
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:17.160]  for liberty and freedom and human dignity so that our national flag not be
[02:54:17.160 --> 02:54:25.520]  an image of a sheep or an image of a ostrich with its head in the sand fill
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:29.680]  one of our graphics people put together what I guess Homeland Security wants to
[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:33.760]  be our new symbol in the stars and stripes of blue area where the stars
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:39.000]  would be we have the ostrich and the sheep as one flag and then we also have
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:45.840]  just the sheep alternate with sheep for the stars but I want to commend
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:48.520]  everybody standing up to big brother sticking their hands down their pants
[02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:53.200]  this is finally broken the trance and we're gonna have victory against this
[02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:56.840]  Webster briefly as I want to get back in North Korea do you agree that this is a
[02:54:56.840 --> 02:55:01.920]  bridge too far the system tried to go too far with this social conditioning for
[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:07.960]  the federal takeover by minimum wage gropers I think it's certainly a very
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:12.360]  important backlash finally against this and the people people are saying it's
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:17.200]  enough already it's too much it's a form of strike it's Americans finally
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:22.160]  getting in the streets in a way and notice the the unfailing totalitarian
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:26.080]  instincts of Obama right immediately he could have Obama could have said well
[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:29.920]  you know this is some bureaucrat going out on his own and they went too far and
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:34.440]  we've had enough of this right Obama is killing himself politically in order to
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:39.160]  serve these Wall Street masters and on this issue he's doing the same thing so
[02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:46.240]  I hope that that this may becomes a voting issue and that the people can you
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.440]  know if these new republicans let's put them to the test let them bring in a
[02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:54.640]  bill immediately in the first week of January to put a stop to this stuff and
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:58.000]  let's vote on it and let's see if these people are worth anything right they
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:03.040]  claim to be populist all right let's let's find out very well said we only
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:06.280]  got a few minutes left and again folks will continue to cover this throughout
[02:56:06.280 --> 02:56:10.280]  Thanksgiving and Friday and into into Sunday at info wars.com and
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:15.440]  prisonplanet.com also want to give thanks to the dredge report really pushing
[02:56:15.440 --> 02:56:19.000]  this out into the national debate that's why they want to censor the internet the
[02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.480]  White House is announcing that finishing up with North Korea I mean this is
[02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:27.200]  pretty scary and now we've got more ships going in more provocations with
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:31.720]  with the lunatic north again where do you see this going well you get the
[02:56:31.720 --> 02:56:35.440]  problem is you've not got two lunatics right you have this this Kim Jong-il and
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:39.680]  Kim Jong-un and this is of course a communist police state and it's a
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:44.640]  horrendous situation but you've also got this president Lee of South Korea who is
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:50.480]  a warmonger and an oppressor in his own right and he's remember that the dynamic
[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:54.920]  of this is when the United States wants to increase its control over South
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:57:00.040]  Korea and Japan they chin up a crisis with North Korea and North Korea is
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:05.760]  very predictable very manipulable in this case it's the Hokus maneuver right
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:09.840]  which happens periodically they have already been shooting incidents as a
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:17.440]  result of Hokus in 1999 2002 and 2009 it's an area of the the western side of
