[00:00.000 --> 00:13.400]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted emblems,
[00:13.400 --> 00:18.200]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commonwealth.
[00:18.200 --> 00:23.120]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown
[00:23.120 --> 00:24.120]  Dallas.
[00:24.120 --> 00:30.120]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:30.120 --> 00:34.120]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[00:37.120 --> 00:40.120]  It was almost as if it were planned in force.
[00:40.120 --> 00:42.120]  It's just pancake.
[00:42.120 --> 01:00.120]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:00.120 --> 01:06.120]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers,
[01:06.120 --> 01:08.120]  not in the hands of criminals.
[01:08.120 --> 01:19.120]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:19.120 --> 01:21.120]  Global governance at last.
[01:21.120 --> 01:22.120]  Is it one world?
[01:22.120 --> 01:24.120]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:24.120 --> 01:27.120]  But aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do?
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.120]  And for me, give me liberty, or give me death!
[01:32.120 --> 01:39.120]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:03.120 --> 02:11.120]  All of them were designated dangerous individuals.
[02:11.120 --> 02:13.120]  Dangerous individuals.
[02:13.120 --> 02:16.120]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.120]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[02:20.120 --> 02:21.120]  They call me dangerous.
[02:21.120 --> 02:23.120]  Danger is my middle name.
[02:23.120 --> 02:25.120]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[02:25.120 --> 02:28.120]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.120]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[02:33.120 --> 02:34.120]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:34.120 --> 02:39.120]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:39.120 --> 02:42.120]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[02:42.120 --> 02:44.120]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.120]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.120]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:49.120 --> 02:50.120]  I want them shut down.
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.120]  I want them silenced.
[02:51.120 --> 02:52.120]  I want them muted.
[02:52.120 --> 02:54.120]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.120]  I want them shut down.
[02:55.120 --> 02:57.120]  I want them silenced.
[02:57.120 --> 02:58.120]  I want them muted.
[02:58.120 --> 03:03.120]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal view.
[03:03.120 --> 03:07.120]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.120]  aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.120]  or harmful content.
[03:12.120 --> 03:16.120]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist,
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.120]  primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.120]  Through your rules, your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[03:25.120 --> 03:28.120]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.120]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[03:32.120 --> 03:35.120]  We need a digital bill of rise.
[03:35.120 --> 03:39.120]  They're becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[03:39.120 --> 03:42.120]  And if you think that you're going to throw up your hands and say,
[03:42.120 --> 03:46.120]  well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[03:46.120 --> 03:47.120]  You are a bad person.
[03:47.120 --> 03:48.120]  You should be censored off the internet.
[03:48.120 --> 03:49.120]  Bad.
[03:49.120 --> 03:50.120]  Yes.
[03:50.120 --> 03:51.120]  Get out of here, Alex.
[03:51.120 --> 03:56.120]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[03:56.120 --> 04:01.120]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is,
[04:01.120 --> 04:05.120]  I'm sorry to say, the Infowars president.
[04:05.120 --> 04:10.120]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.120]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[04:15.120 --> 04:25.120]  Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday Worldwide Broadcast.
[04:25.120 --> 04:28.120]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[04:28.120 --> 04:38.120]  And when we come back from break, I'm going to do my very, very best that I can to lay out the news and information
[04:38.120 --> 04:45.120]  and try to counter the globalist operations as best I can today.
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.120]  We've got really an incredible amount of information to get to.
[04:49.120 --> 05:00.120]  And I'm going to really try my best on the other side of this break.
[05:00.120 --> 05:08.120]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[05:08.120 --> 05:12.120]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[05:12.120 --> 05:19.120]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[05:19.120 --> 05:25.120]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.120]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[05:30.120 --> 05:31.120]  That's been incredible.
[05:31.120 --> 05:38.120]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:38.120 --> 05:47.120]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[05:47.120 --> 05:52.120]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:56.120 --> 06:23.120]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:26.120 --> 06:44.120]  It's Tuesday, May 14, 2019.
[06:44.120 --> 06:46.120]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:46.120 --> 06:48.120]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[06:48.120 --> 06:51.120]  Paul Watson will be with us in the fourth hour.
[06:51.120 --> 07:04.120]  Investigative journalist will be joining us coming up in the second hour, John Rappaport, who's had his NoMoreFakeNews.com website for 18 years.
[07:04.120 --> 07:14.120]  And because it had a lot of information exposing vaccine damage and mainline information, it was taken down and removed this weekend.
[07:14.120 --> 07:21.120]  He'll be popping in and joining us as well, but that's just an example of the massive rollout against free speech.
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.120]  It's not just happening here, but happening all over the world.
[07:24.120 --> 07:33.120]  And we also have Caitlin Bennett with some of the just over the top important reports he's been filing multiple times daily,
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.120]  popping in.
[07:35.120 --> 07:43.120]  Now, obviously, the news just gets more intense every day, and there's a bunch of news I didn't get to yesterday that is so important.
[07:43.120 --> 07:54.120]  That's cultural, dealing with the dehumanization, the demoralization that we're under, that I'm going to get to some of that very important news today.
[07:54.120 --> 08:00.120]  Obviously, on the front burner is all the geopolitical news and war news.
[08:00.120 --> 08:14.120]  We have a headline up on infowars.com and newswars.com right now that has the post of the live video and audio feeds, the radio slash television,
[08:14.120 --> 08:21.120]  and the headline is war with Iran, question mark.
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.120]  Has this war basically already started?
[08:25.120 --> 08:35.120]  And that's obviously a situation that if it does go into full scale war is not going to be as easy.
[08:35.120 --> 08:38.120]  And I'm not saying the Iraq war in the two different rounds was easy.
[08:38.120 --> 08:42.120]  It was terrible for everybody involved, but this is going to be much, much worse.
[08:42.120 --> 08:49.120]  Every analyst agrees Iran is a completely different kettle of fish or barrel of snakes.
[08:49.120 --> 08:53.120]  You could say, and this is a serious situation.
[08:53.120 --> 08:59.120]  Iran says U.S. false flag drone attack on Saudi Arabia.
[08:59.120 --> 09:02.120]  In fact, that was my original headline this morning.
[09:02.120 --> 09:04.120]  I was at war with Iran.
[09:04.120 --> 09:08.120]  Saudi Arabia says they've been attacked.
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.120]  Or is it a false flag?
[09:10.120 --> 09:12.120]  And you have to ask that question.
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.120]  Is something a false flag because so many times in history, things are false flags.
[09:17.120 --> 09:21.120]  Does it mean I like the dictator in Venezuela?
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.120]  But you could clearly have a false flag to get us into a war there.
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.120]  Does it mean I like the moolas?
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.120]  I'm all for regime change.
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.120]  They're not popular.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.120]  They're a dictatorship.
[09:29.120 --> 09:34.120]  I'd love to see the Persian people free with the restart movement or some of the other grassroots, populist movements.
[09:34.120 --> 09:42.120]  But it's reasonable when there's a big event like this, supposedly Saudi ships are being attacked.
[09:42.120 --> 09:47.120]  Supposedly drones are flying into pipelines and blowing up.
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.120]  Why would Iran want to be blown off the face of the earth?
[09:51.120 --> 09:58.120]  Why would Syria, when it was winning the war against ISIS in al-Qaeda, launch four different chemical attacks against themselves
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.120]  when Obama said that that was the red line and that we would invade if they did?
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.120]  Why are they ever winning when they do something like that?
[10:04.120 --> 10:07.120]  And of course it turned out those were false flags.
[10:07.120 --> 10:12.120]  So they don't want us on air questioning things and saying, hey, could this be a false flag?
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.120]  I'll tell you though, the Iranians are crazy.
[10:16.120 --> 10:18.120]  And they're looking for trouble.
[10:18.120 --> 10:20.120]  And they've been grabbing our ships for no reason.
[10:20.120 --> 10:22.120]  And they've been starting a lot of fights.
[10:22.120 --> 10:24.120]  And they've been filled with a lot of bravada.
[10:24.120 --> 10:30.120]  And so I wouldn't put it past some of their revolutionary guard or others.
[10:30.120 --> 10:36.120]  Firing these basic makeshift cruise missiles at Saudi Arabia.
[10:36.120 --> 10:40.120]  I wouldn't put it past them also to pull something crazy because they've done stuff like this before.
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.120]  And you understand, I know the audience understands this, but Saudi Arabia is where Mecca and Medina
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.120]  and the meteorite are and the Kabul and all the rest of it.
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.120]  That's where they do the hodge and all of the key rituals.
[10:54.120 --> 10:56.120]  And so it's the center of Islam.
[10:56.120 --> 10:59.120]  It's Sunni Islam, 79% of Islam.
[10:59.120 --> 11:04.120]  The Shiites are probably the oldest form of Islam.
[11:04.120 --> 11:07.120]  You can argue, but they believe it's hereditary.
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.120]  You cannot be in the priest class unless you're related.
[11:11.120 --> 11:18.120]  It's a form of royalty. It's a dynastic religion, basically.
[11:18.120 --> 11:24.120]  And that's why all those Ayatollahs look like their clones because they're all imbred.
[11:24.120 --> 11:27.120]  And of course, you know what comes with being imbred, right?
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.120]  Mental illness.
[11:30.120 --> 11:36.120]  1300 years of inbreeding by the Shiite command.
[11:36.120 --> 11:45.120]  And with the 1979 revolution, they were able to get a foothold and get in control of an industrialized country.
[11:45.120 --> 11:48.120]  And it's been a crisis ever since.
[11:48.120 --> 11:50.120]  So this is a very serious situation.
[11:50.120 --> 11:53.120]  I'm not saying it's a false flag.
[11:53.120 --> 12:01.120]  I'm saying it is reasonable when people don't have a motive and where they stand to get their asses blown off the map.
[12:01.120 --> 12:04.120]  Why would you attack Saudi Arabia?
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.120]  Iran has done some loony tune stuff and taken credit before.
[12:08.120 --> 12:17.120]  So the U.S. would deploy 120,000 troops if Iran attacks American forces in echoes of Iraq.
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.120]  Well, it's going to take a lot more than that.
[12:21.120 --> 12:22.120]  So that's just some of the news.
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.120]  Beijing joins Iran, calls for people's war against the U.S. and Trump.
[12:26.120 --> 12:30.120]  So China is officially basically declaring economic and cultural war against us.
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.120]  That's been going on a long time.
[12:31.120 --> 12:32.120]  Now it's just out in the open.
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.120]  We've been in a trade war for 40 years.
[12:34.120 --> 12:36.120]  We're just now fighting back.
[12:36.120 --> 12:45.120]  Also, we're going to continue Iran's Zaraf warrants of risk of extremist individuals in the U.S. government wanting war.
[12:45.120 --> 12:47.120]  That's in Reuters.
[12:47.120 --> 12:55.120]  Iran says U.S. and Trump playing very dangerous game of and are risking devastating war.
[12:55.120 --> 12:57.120]  It will definitely be devastating for you.
[12:57.120 --> 13:02.120]  Saudi Arabia, again, oil stations attacked by drones.
[13:02.120 --> 13:11.120]  Saudi Energy Minister said today that two oil pumping stations for east-west pipeline had been hit by explosive laden drones,
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.120]  calling the attack an act of terrorism that targeted global oil supplies.
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.120]  But the Iranian government has come out and I don't have that article that's on Drudge Report.
[13:19.120 --> 13:20.120]  Will you guys print that for me?
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.120]  Thanks.
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.120]  It's toppling up there.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.120]  It says that their government is saying false flag.
[13:24.120 --> 13:25.120]  I'd like to have that.
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.120]  Thanks.
[13:26.120 --> 13:29.120]  Oil tankers sabotaged as Gulf tensions soared.
[13:29.120 --> 13:32.120]  This is an article out of Yahoo!
[13:32.120 --> 13:38.120]  Four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, were damaged in mysterious sabotage attacks
[13:38.120 --> 13:43.120]  that have inflamed Gulf tensions amid a standoff between the United States and Iran.
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.120]  Why would Iran try to start a war they're going to lose?
[13:47.120 --> 13:50.120]  They already lost a proxy war with Iraq that we funded.
[13:50.120 --> 13:53.120]  They already blew up their fleet in Operation Praying Manus.
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.120]  Well, they've got Hezbollah all over the world, all over the Middle East,
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.120]  and they've been winning wars the last few years, even against Israel and proxy wars in Lebanon.
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.120]  And that's a big reason why they actually could be doing this.
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.120]  They could actually be punching Saudi Arabia in the nose,
[14:09.120 --> 14:16.120]  trying to start the big conflagration in the World War that brings in the body and the Islamic takeover of the planet.
[14:16.120 --> 14:18.120]  That's their belief.
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.120]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.120]  I'm saying that's what they believe.
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.120]  In the face of growing international concerns, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.120]  scrapped a planned visit to Moscow, headed to Brussels instead,
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.120]  talked to money with European officials,
[14:35.120 --> 14:40.120]  as Britain warned of the danger of conflict erupting by accident in the Gulf.
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.120]  Acting Pentagon Chief Shanahan proposed a revamped military plan
[14:44.120 --> 14:49.120]  that the meeting with senior advisors and aides would send up to 120,000 U.S. troops
[14:49.120 --> 14:54.120]  to the Middle East, where Iran to attack any American forces.
[14:54.120 --> 14:58.120]  Well, we need to put 120,000 troops on our border that's collapsed.
[14:58.120 --> 15:03.120]  We do not need to have a war with Iran.
[15:03.120 --> 15:07.120]  It is not in our hemisphere.
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.120]  It is not in our interest.
[15:10.120 --> 15:12.120]  I understand that Iran is getting nuclear weapons.
[15:12.120 --> 15:13.120]  They've already had them.
[15:13.120 --> 15:15.120]  They're getting delivery systems.
[15:15.120 --> 15:17.120]  I understand Saudi Arabia's already got nukes.
[15:17.120 --> 15:22.120]  I get that things are spiraling out of control just like between Pakistan and India.
[15:22.120 --> 15:26.120]  I've said that Venezuela is in our hemisphere.
[15:26.120 --> 15:29.120]  Collapsing into Central America is communist run.
[15:29.120 --> 15:33.120]  The U.N. has set up bases there to flood us with illegal aliens.
[15:33.120 --> 15:37.120]  We have a right to go in there and stop that.
[15:37.120 --> 15:43.120]  Doesn't mean I'm saying do it because the neocons would somehow turn it into a big mess.

[17:38.120 --> 17:44.120]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.120]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[17:48.120 --> 17:50.120]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for?
[17:50.120 --> 17:53.120]  The deep state began with World War I.

[20:27.120 --> 20:30.120]  So many folks want to be outlawed country.
[20:30.120 --> 20:34.120]  So many people say they want to be rock and roll, they smash guitars on stage.
[20:34.120 --> 20:38.120]  They wear black eyeliner.
[20:38.120 --> 20:41.120]  Okay, a lot of folks think that's cool, whatever.
[20:41.120 --> 20:44.120]  We take on the globalist at point blank range.
[20:44.120 --> 20:47.120]  We take on living Nazi collaborators.
[20:47.120 --> 20:49.120]  We take on pedophile rings.
[20:49.120 --> 20:51.120]  We take on the chai comms.
[20:51.120 --> 20:55.120]  We take on their failed ideologies and we beat them.
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.120]  And I want to be a trillion percent clear here.
[20:58.120 --> 21:03.120]  You are defeating the globalist.
[21:03.120 --> 21:09.120]  Because when the truth is standing, it trumps all the lies and people want truth.
[21:09.120 --> 21:10.120]  They want prosperity.
[21:10.120 --> 21:12.120]  They want justice.
[21:12.120 --> 21:16.120]  Now it's these type of broadcasts and it's happening more and more.
[21:16.120 --> 21:20.120]  Where I do a lot of preparation at night, a lot of preparation in the morning,
[21:20.120 --> 21:25.120]  a lot of preparation up here at the office in the studio.
[21:25.120 --> 21:29.120]  And I don't want to say it's like I overprepare,
[21:29.120 --> 21:33.120]  but then I'm looking at the budgeting I have of guests that are coming on,
[21:33.120 --> 21:36.120]  the time I have, and what I've got to cover.
[21:36.120 --> 21:42.120]  And it just makes me feel like I'm being inadequate because it's just unbelievable.
[21:42.120 --> 21:50.120]  The amount of incredible news and information that we've got coming up here today.
[21:50.120 --> 21:53.120]  So let me finish up with what's happening in the Middle East right now.
[21:53.120 --> 21:55.120]  And the fact that a war has already begun.
[21:55.120 --> 22:02.120]  The question is how serious, how out of control is it going to get with what I was mentioning earlier?
[22:02.120 --> 22:04.120]  Is this a false flag?
[22:04.120 --> 22:11.120]  Why would Yemen or why would Iran fly drones into oil tanks
[22:11.120 --> 22:12.120]  and try to blow them up?
[22:12.120 --> 22:17.120]  Why would people attack ships in the Gulf?
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.120]  Why would they be doing that?
[22:19.120 --> 22:23.120]  U.S. News and World Report has got all the quotes here.
[22:23.120 --> 22:27.120]  Iranian state media said today that the pipeline attack in Saudi Arabia
[22:27.120 --> 22:31.120]  was carried out by seven drones of Yemen's armed forces,
[22:31.120 --> 22:34.120]  signing an unnamed Yemeni source,
[22:34.120 --> 22:37.120]  which said the operation was retaliation for Saudi Arabia's aggression
[22:37.120 --> 22:40.120]  and siege of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula state.
[22:40.120 --> 22:50.120]  Now, remember, Yemen and that whole civil war is a proxy war between Iran and between Saudi Arabia.
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.120]  So that could have indeed been Yemen.
[22:53.120 --> 22:57.120]  And Yemen hasn't officially taken credit, but they've launched drone attacks on Riyadh.
[22:57.120 --> 22:58.120]  You name it before.
[22:58.120 --> 23:04.120]  Large drone attacks, missile attacks, ICBM attacks.
[23:04.120 --> 23:11.120]  So this could be real.
[23:11.120 --> 23:16.120]  The issue is, though, are we going to blame Iran because this is their proxy force
[23:16.120 --> 23:19.120]  and are we going to be off the races with a war with Iran
[23:19.120 --> 23:25.120]  that is going to mean sleeper cells in Europe and the United States
[23:25.120 --> 23:29.120]  that are going to stage real terror attacks,
[23:29.120 --> 23:31.120]  not just truck bombings,
[23:31.120 --> 23:37.120]  but chlorine gas dumped down the air conditioning vent systems of 50-story buildings
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.120]  and stuff like that.
[23:38.120 --> 23:40.120]  That's their specialties.
[23:40.120 --> 23:43.120]  So let me tell you, war breaks out with Iran.
[23:43.120 --> 23:46.120]  You better be looking for terror attacks
[23:46.120 --> 23:51.120]  and better be aware that Trump is going to nuke the living hell out of those imams
[23:51.120 --> 23:52.120]  if that happens.
[23:52.120 --> 23:55.120]  So that's where the world is right now.
[23:55.120 --> 24:01.120]  Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif,
[24:01.120 --> 24:06.120]  on Tuesday warned against so-called false flag operations of the U.S. and its Gulf allies
[24:06.120 --> 24:09.120]  wished to attribute to Iran, including the recent tanker attack.
[24:09.120 --> 24:15.120]  So Iran is saying the attack on a tanker that no one knows exactly what was is a false flag.
[24:15.120 --> 24:19.120]  So Iran is officially saying that that is a false flag.
[24:19.120 --> 24:27.120]  We will monitor this situation as it unfolds here in great detail today.
[24:27.120 --> 24:34.120]  And we'll definitely get some experts on as well in the next few days to follow all of this.
[24:34.120 --> 24:40.120]  But I really think that we should be praying for peace and really seeking God's face
[24:40.120 --> 24:46.120]  because everything that's unfolding here is biblical.
[24:46.120 --> 24:50.120]  And it's obviously very, very serious.
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.120]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up in the next segment.
[24:52.120 --> 24:58.120]  We have plenty of time in this segment left, but I just want people to know what we've got here on the play.
[24:58.120 --> 25:04.120]  We have a Greg Rees report that just went up on infowars.com that is so important
[25:04.120 --> 25:09.120]  that needs to be seen, that everyone needs to email and text message
[25:09.120 --> 25:13.120]  and show their neighbors, their friends, their family.
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.120]  The video asks, do bears go to the bathroom in the woods?
[25:18.120 --> 25:27.120]  The headline is, are the Clintons involved in human trafficking?
[25:27.120 --> 25:33.120]  And then it goes through the fact that they absolutely are.
[25:33.120 --> 25:42.120]  And then I've got a pretty funny Howard Stern piece and he's done a bunch of these
[25:42.120 --> 25:50.120]  and I've seen most of them, but I haven't played any of these because they're silly, but it's not really important.
[25:50.120 --> 25:57.120]  This one makes fun of the fact that there's massive child trafficking going on.
[25:57.120 --> 26:03.120]  And I just wanted to play the Clinton piece and then I'm going to play the Howard Stern piece
[26:03.120 --> 26:07.120]  or maybe vice versa because it's, you know, it's not funny.
[26:07.120 --> 26:12.120]  So you catch yourself laughing at it the way they put it on, it is funny.
[26:12.120 --> 26:15.120]  And it sugarcoats this, you know, poison that's going on.
[26:15.120 --> 26:21.120]  And Stern says that I'm calling Jimmy Kimmel a pedophile,
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.120]  that I'm saying George Soros is a pedophile.
[26:25.120 --> 26:30.120]  And so people watching or listening to that, yeah, Jimmy Kimmel in the studio with him,
[26:30.120 --> 26:36.120]  would think that I'm actually doing that.
[26:36.120 --> 26:43.120]  And that's not, I'm not said George Soros is a pedophile or that Jimmy Kimmel was a pedophile.
[26:43.120 --> 26:47.120]  I've said George Soros said on 60 Minutes that he was a Nazi collaborator and is proud of it.
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.120]  It was the best time of his life.
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.120]  It was happy making, those are real quotes.
[26:52.120 --> 26:56.120]  So it's very, very sad.
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.120]  And they've got Soros simulating, eating a baby.
[26:59.120 --> 27:02.120]  Hey, Stern, it's bad luck to make jokes about that.
[27:02.120 --> 27:07.120]  It's the sacrament of the left now and all that and, you know, they've got all the movies, Hail Satan out there making fun of dead babies.
[27:07.120 --> 27:09.120]  And they're killing babies after they're born.
[27:09.120 --> 27:16.120]  And you got the governor of Virginia and all these other governors passing laws that you keep it legal and they kill them after they're born.
[27:16.120 --> 27:19.120]  But this is serious stuff.
[27:19.120 --> 27:24.120]  And, you know, I've been on Howard Stern's show before, got a big response off of it.
[27:24.120 --> 27:25.120]  They had a vote.
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.120]  They said I was one of the most popular guests they ever had.
[27:28.120 --> 27:36.120]  And they say, Stern has got me back because the corporates don't want you to see the real human side of Alex Jones.
[27:36.120 --> 27:47.120]  They want to see a puppet talking in my voice so that we can make light of all the child trafficking and the Catholic church taken over by it.
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.120]  And just the massive numbers of kids being brought across the U.S. border.
[27:51.120 --> 27:53.120]  Tens of thousands come up missing, hundreds found dead.
[27:53.120 --> 28:01.120]  Senate report, Washington Post reported Obama helped traffic children of the U.S. that disappeared in the child sex trafficking.
[28:01.120 --> 28:06.120]  So that's not something you want to joke around about.
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.120]  You want to say my supplements have got poison in them or whatever.
[28:09.120 --> 28:11.120]  That's something you can do all day long.
[28:11.120 --> 28:19.120]  But, you know, Stern used to say you were Mr. Free Speech, that you were the guy that didn't matter who it was.
[28:19.120 --> 28:29.120]  You'd have Nambla on, you'd have Nazis on, you'd have the worst people on, but you can't have me on because you're not your own man anymore.
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.120]  And I challenge Stern, if he's not a slave of the system, to actually have me on the show.
[28:35.120 --> 28:36.120]  I thought you want ratings, right?
[28:36.120 --> 28:38.120]  He used to say interview Hitler.
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.120]  You're allowed to, but oh, not me.
[28:42.120 --> 28:43.120]  What is it, Stern?
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.120]  See, because I'm going to show the Senate report on Obama child trafficking.
[28:47.120 --> 28:49.120]  I don't just say it, that's why.
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.120]  Not because we're fake, because we're real.
[28:52.120 --> 28:55.120]  Not because we're liars, but because we're the truth.
[28:55.120 --> 28:56.120]  Infowars.com.
[28:56.120 --> 29:25.120]  Tomorrow's news today, so much coming up.
[29:26.120 --> 29:53.120]  We'll be right back.
[29:53.120 --> 30:19.120]  We'll be right back.
[30:19.120 --> 30:46.120]  We'll be right back.
[30:46.120 --> 31:15.120]  We'll be right back.
[31:15.120 --> 31:37.120]  We'll be right back.
[31:37.120 --> 32:04.120]  We'll be right back.
[32:04.120 --> 32:32.120]  We'll be right back.
[32:32.120 --> 32:58.120]  We'll be right back.
[33:03.120 --> 33:11.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.120 --> 33:33.120]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance rallying patriots worldwide.
[33:33.120 --> 33:47.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:47.120 --> 33:55.120]  The tip of the defense of the Renaissance, the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty.
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.120]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[33:59.120 --> 34:05.120]  The high priest of the information war and the enemy fights to ensure that we never find each other.
[34:05.120 --> 34:11.120]  But you found us, so stand up and be counted.
[34:11.120 --> 34:34.120]  For what you are about to receive, we are the dealers to give you everything you need.
[34:34.120 --> 34:49.120]  The globalists are going to fail, so for those about to resist the globalists, we salute you.
[34:49.120 --> 34:51.120]  Let's get into it.
[34:51.120 --> 35:02.120]  We rock it down on the front line.
[35:02.120 --> 35:11.120]  I said I'd start getting to some of the news and I hit literally in that last segment, 1% of what I want to cover.
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.120]  And this is where we enter the paradox of why I'm so frustrated.
[35:16.120 --> 35:17.120]  I want to take all the calls.
[35:17.120 --> 35:18.120]  I want to have all the guests.
[35:18.120 --> 35:19.120]  I want to cover it all.
[35:19.120 --> 35:21.120]  So let's just, let me just do this.
[35:21.120 --> 35:27.120]  Let me just give you a few of the things I've got here in the stack.
[35:27.120 --> 35:33.120]  New developments, the financial markets agree, the analysts agree, what I said yesterday, it's obvious.
[35:33.120 --> 35:40.120]  Apple Laws at Supreme Court is a big victory for consumers fighting Big Tech's app and platform monopolies.
[35:40.120 --> 35:48.120]  MarketWatch, the Wall Street Journal, and they all admit it's a bad sign for their attempts to carry out censorship as well.
[35:48.120 --> 35:55.120]  That is a big old juicy ruling right on time.
[35:55.120 --> 35:57.120]  That is a godsend.
[35:57.120 --> 36:02.120]  That is water in the desert.
[36:02.120 --> 36:03.120]  Look at this article.
[36:03.120 --> 36:06.120]  The average person would read this article and I see these everywhere in the news.
[36:06.120 --> 36:14.120]  Trump towers now one of New York City's least desirable luxury buildings, says Bloomberg.
[36:14.120 --> 36:17.120]  Oh, things aren't going too well for you.
[36:17.120 --> 36:18.120]  Are they Trump?
[36:18.120 --> 36:24.120]  Said the spider.
[36:24.120 --> 36:32.120]  Trump's brand was success and luxury in hotels and in condos and in golf courses and all of it.
[36:32.120 --> 36:38.120]  He knew when he ran as a populist firebrand that he'd lose billions and he did.
[36:38.120 --> 36:45.120]  And so they spent it like, look, he's a loser because he's got all these boycotts and lawsuits and attacks.
[36:45.120 --> 36:46.120]  It's like George Washington.
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.120]  Hey, George Washington lost most of his savings during the war.
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.120]  He's a loser.
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.120]  Wow, did you see that fighter in the 12th round?
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.120]  He won the fight, but man, he was bleeding.
[36:58.120 --> 36:59.120]  He's a loser.
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.120]  No, it's called being a winner.
[37:02.120 --> 37:11.120]  It's like you see some veteran in a foreign war, save some of his buddies when they're pinned down and gets his leg blown off.
[37:11.120 --> 37:13.120]  People don't go, oh, that's a loser.
[37:13.120 --> 37:16.120]  That's a winner.
[37:16.120 --> 37:23.120]  They're not with the meek people sucking their thumbs.
[37:23.120 --> 37:29.120]  And again, it's just the way you see an article and you see how they try to make it look like.
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  Jones is being sued.
[37:31.120 --> 37:33.120]  Jones is being de-platformed.
[37:33.120 --> 37:34.120]  Jones is being demonized.
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  Jones is being physically attacked.
[37:36.120 --> 37:37.120]  He's a loser.
[37:37.120 --> 37:38.120]  No, we're winners.
[37:38.120 --> 37:44.120]  We've already changed the world for populism and nationalism and Christianity and the family and sovereignty.
[37:44.120 --> 37:47.120]  We're under attack because we're so successful.
[37:47.120 --> 37:51.120]  We're lied about because we're so truthful.
[37:51.120 --> 37:55.120]  And I know our hardcore audience gets it, but a lot of the audience comes up to me.
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.120]  I get mobbed on the street and they say, oh man, we're so sorry for you.
[37:59.120 --> 38:00.120]  I bet it's horrible.
[38:00.120 --> 38:03.120]  We wish we could still find you and I'm like in FullWars.com.
[38:03.120 --> 38:04.120]  It's all there.
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.120]  And they're like, well, how are you taking it?
[38:06.120 --> 38:08.120]  How am I taking it?
[38:08.120 --> 38:11.120]  Taking it very well.
[38:11.120 --> 38:13.120]  This is everything I ever asked for.
[38:13.120 --> 38:15.120]  And again, this isn't about me.
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.120]  It's about enemy propaganda trying to demoralize you.
[38:18.120 --> 38:23.120]  We're in a war against anti-human, sick sociopathic globalist.
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.120]  Do you think we're going to go through this war and not get a scratch or not lose everything
[38:29.120 --> 38:36.120]  we got or not lose an arm, a leg, an eye, a bank account, your life?
[38:36.120 --> 38:42.120]  You're going to lose everything anyways, the globalist.
[38:42.120 --> 38:46.120]  Unless we double down and say, this isn't a game of chicken.
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.120]  I'm not moving.
[38:48.120 --> 38:50.120]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[38:50.120 --> 38:53.120]  Like I told them in that famous speech 10 years ago in Dallas.
[38:53.120 --> 39:00.120]  I don't know how this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe.
[39:00.120 --> 39:01.120]  You got one.
[39:01.120 --> 39:07.120]  So once you're in a fight and they get a good punch in or a good stab and they're like,
[39:07.120 --> 39:08.120]  ah, you're bleeding.
[39:08.120 --> 39:09.120]  Ah, you're bleeding.
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.120]  Yeah, I know I'm bleeding.
[39:11.120 --> 39:12.120]  You're bleeding a lot worse.
[39:12.120 --> 39:14.120]  This isn't time to sit around and talk.
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.120]  I'm going to beat your head in politically.
[39:17.120 --> 39:21.120]  When I'm done, you're going to have X's in your eyes, New World Order.
[39:21.120 --> 39:24.120]  If I stumble off and fall on the ditch, it doesn't matter at that point.
[39:24.120 --> 39:26.120]  I'm going to get your ass.
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.120]  So figure that out.
[39:27.120 --> 39:33.120]  So this whole idea that we're getting on asses kicked here is not true.
[39:33.120 --> 39:34.120]  We're in a fight.
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.120]  We're looking for the fight.
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.120]  And we're not looking for the fight because we want to be prize fighters or we want to
[39:40.120 --> 39:41.120]  be a tough in front of people.
[39:41.120 --> 39:46.120]  These people have been messing with our kids and our country and our freedom and it's
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.120]  time people say no to them.
[39:48.120 --> 39:53.120]  But it's time you expect to get attacked and it's time all of us when the enemy attacks
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.120]  us and calls us losers know we're winners, you're losers.
[39:59.120 --> 40:01.120]  You chose the establishment.
[40:01.120 --> 40:04.120]  We chose the road less traveled.
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.120]  So I tell you more what's coming up.
[40:06.120 --> 40:16.500]  Some good news, Barr makes good, opens criminal investigation of the illegal spying and appoints
[40:16.500 --> 40:23.780]  John H. Durham, who has actually convicted quite a few FBI agents and others of criminal
[40:23.780 --> 40:33.300]  activity in the past and would be the pick, the pick, to prosecute the swamp.
[40:33.300 --> 40:41.380]  So that's a big issue, a big development, and we're going to get into that more.
[40:41.380 --> 40:46.040]  Then without even looking for this, people say, Alex, why do you cover this a lot?
[40:46.040 --> 40:48.820]  It's because it's what goes on in the schools and the media.
[40:48.820 --> 40:49.820]  It's everywhere.
[40:49.820 --> 40:51.220]  We didn't even get to it yesterday.
[40:51.220 --> 40:57.980]  The Chips of Hoyad with this obnoxious man in drag talking about mothers, it's all about
[40:57.980 --> 41:00.040]  the left taking over the power of women.
[41:00.040 --> 41:05.540]  That's what this is, and giant men powerlifting and beating women and saying they're women.
[41:05.540 --> 41:10.140]  All of this is a sick assault on women.
[41:10.140 --> 41:11.140]  It's unbelievable.
[41:11.140 --> 41:17.700]  I've got a whole stack of areas getting into that, hell, this trans athlete is fighting
[41:17.700 --> 41:20.580]  back after being banned by the USA powerlifting.
[41:20.580 --> 41:26.220]  That's right, this big old giant dude wants to beat all the women and he's a hero, I mean
[41:26.220 --> 41:32.220]  she's a hero and is going to beat all the women, I mean this is a sick joke, but again
[41:32.220 --> 41:35.820]  we're entering this world government where they're going to have all these designer humans
[41:35.820 --> 41:38.820]  that aren't human, and they want to get you used to saying there are no mothers, there
[41:38.820 --> 41:43.780]  are no fathers, there are no genders because there already aren't in many cases with the
[41:43.780 --> 41:46.820]  genetic engineering.
[41:46.820 --> 41:54.380]  So this is all a complete joke and it's meant to overturn reason and have the high priests
[41:54.380 --> 42:04.740]  of social control tell you that a 300 pound man who looks like a gorilla is a woman, no
[42:04.740 --> 42:08.740]  they're genetics, they're heart, everything, they don't have mitochondrial DNA, it's not
[42:08.740 --> 42:14.660]  a woman, it's not a woman, it's not a woman, it has nothing to do with being nice to quote
[42:14.660 --> 42:20.060]  gay people or whatever, and all the make believe fantasy land stuff, and the news is like trans
[42:20.060 --> 42:25.940]  people in the areas of the Middle East and China, they can't get the money they need
[42:25.940 --> 42:31.260]  so they're chopping their own genitals off and kids in the US are chopping their wheelies
[42:31.260 --> 42:36.660]  off and the media is like oh it's beautiful, no that's mental illness, you know if I chopped
[42:36.660 --> 42:40.900]  a few of my fingers off or maybe ate them like they were Cheetos, like my fingers identify
[42:40.900 --> 42:46.060]  as Cheetos and I ate them, they put me in a rubber room, but if I went I'm transgendered
[42:46.060 --> 42:52.180]  and took a meat cleaver, the news would say look at him, Alex Jones just cut his testicles
[42:52.180 --> 42:59.740]  and penis off on national television, give that man a cigar, he's not insane at all.

[46:22.420 --> 46:26.700]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[46:26.700 --> 46:31.780]  hours and have terrible side effects. We have developed hands down from our research, the

[46:57.980 --> 47:03.620]  and infowarslife.com.
[47:03.620 --> 47:22.900]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:22.900 --> 47:26.900]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live. Well, I must hit the right button. Howard
[47:26.900 --> 47:30.400]  Stern's producer just called up during the break. And again, yeah, I want to go on Howard
[47:30.400 --> 47:34.220]  Stern's show. It's a huge show. One of the biggest responses I've ever gotten to any
[47:34.220 --> 47:38.540]  media is going on Howard Stern. I only think bigger to be like Joe Rogan. You go on CNN,
[47:38.540 --> 47:44.260]  even Fox News, no response. You go on Howard Stern, huge response. Even though they say
[47:44.260 --> 47:48.420]  the show's not as big as it used to be because it's on a terrestrial radio. And you know,
[47:48.420 --> 47:53.140]  I've been on Howard Stern and I've been on his subshows probably 30 times or so. And
[47:53.140 --> 47:57.700]  they've got this funny comedian, I forget his name that goes on there and does these
[47:57.700 --> 48:03.140]  skit pieces about me and I think they're hilarious, quite frankly. But when it comes to the child
[48:03.140 --> 48:10.060]  trafficking, it's not funny because I'm not saying George Soros is a child trafficker
[48:10.060 --> 48:15.500]  and I'm not saying that Jimmy Kimmel is. And I get the joke. Supposedly I'm saying that's
[48:15.500 --> 48:24.860]  about everybody. Listen, when I had FBI agents, when I was a kid and DEA agents and Army officers
[48:24.860 --> 48:31.780]  and CIA people and just the folks that I knew growing up in Dallas and people like General
[48:31.780 --> 48:36.860]  Bitton K. Parton later, former head of Air Force Weapons Development telling me at the
[48:36.860 --> 48:48.700]  bottom at the end of the rat hole is Satanism. And I would roll my eyes 40 years ago, 25
[48:48.700 --> 48:57.660]  years ago, but I don't roll my eyes anymore. So George Soros is a admitted Nazi collaborator.
[48:57.660 --> 49:06.920]  So to then say that I'm saying he's a child molester as a joke. Well, the piece is hilarious.
[49:06.920 --> 49:13.660]  But then you pull back and you go, but it's not funny to have Soros on wheel of Soros
[49:13.660 --> 49:19.780]  eating babies and stuff. Because the wars and the devaluations and the things he's done
[49:19.780 --> 49:25.100]  actually have caused a lot of death. And so I know I'm persecuted for standing up to
[49:25.100 --> 49:34.660]  Soros. Somebody's got to do it. And the old days, Jimmy Kimmel would do skits on me and
[49:34.660 --> 49:39.340]  laugh about it and say I was entertaining. Why am I never invited on any of these shows
[49:39.340 --> 49:46.060]  because they don't want to humanize me? I mean, obviously, Sturm would have the highest
[49:46.060 --> 49:52.740]  ratings he's had in years that he has me on. He did his book launch and mock interviewed
[49:52.740 --> 49:56.820]  me a month ago. His official book launch was an Alex Jones interview. Why not interview
[49:56.820 --> 50:02.820]  the real Alex Jones? It's just ridiculous because, again, they want to build a straw
[50:02.820 --> 50:09.500]  man so they can lie about the straw man. And so you actually never hear the real person.
[50:09.500 --> 50:14.980]  And I'm not even saying Stern wants to do that. It's all formulaic. I was on Turkey's
[50:14.980 --> 50:18.700]  national state run channel that's international. It's one of their biggest shows. You could
[50:18.700 --> 50:23.380]  argue it's one of the biggest shows Turkey has. And Turkey's a powerful big country living
[50:23.380 --> 50:31.940]  in the ruins of Constantinople and Christianity. And I went on there for like almost 25 minutes.
[50:31.940 --> 50:36.700]  We only cut a few minutes of it. And it was just a scripted interview. It was the same
[50:36.700 --> 50:43.180]  old crap. You admit you're an actor. Never said that. You said you have psychosis. Didn't
[50:43.180 --> 50:49.700]  say that. You said you're fake. Didn't say that. And it's all cherry picked. Or I said
[50:49.700 --> 50:56.940]  it's almost like a form, almost like a form of psychosis. When you're lied to so much,
[50:56.940 --> 51:04.300]  you start believing nothing you're told even though some of it's true. And so they just
[51:04.300 --> 51:09.820]  go with these word games. And I use these tactics on everybody like saying Trump hates
[51:09.820 --> 51:16.860]  all Mexicans. Never said it. Never said anything close to it. But that's how these people operate.
[51:16.860 --> 51:23.140]  And coming up, the first thing I'm going to get to in the next hour is the young turds.
[51:23.140 --> 51:28.020]  Now the young turds are named after a genocidal anti-Christian organization that carried out
[51:28.020 --> 51:32.500]  their Armenian genocide. And they know what they're doing. And they're very deceptive.
[51:32.500 --> 51:36.780]  They're big liars. They'll set you up. They are really disingenuous. And they've gotten
[51:36.780 --> 51:43.980]  reportedly over $50 million from Gulf state dictatorships. I mean, they admitted to the
[51:43.980 --> 51:50.220]  tens of millions. Soros money, Hillary money, threw the election for Hillary against Bernie.
[51:50.220 --> 51:56.900]  They had the founder of Antifa on. And again, here's all these rich guys on there. They're
[51:56.900 --> 52:02.380]  buying full pages of New York Times. And he puts out all these lies about Trump and calls
[52:02.380 --> 52:07.420]  for an overthrow of the government. Now remember, they had me deplatformed off all these places
[52:07.420 --> 52:12.300]  saying I was calling for killing journalists. There was no video. They just took quotes
[52:12.300 --> 52:18.580]  out of context and put them together word salad. This guy doesn't think conservatives
[52:18.580 --> 52:22.740]  or nationalists or Christians deserve speech. He calls us fascists. And he lies about the
[52:22.740 --> 52:29.820]  president being a warmonger when the president is trying to end all these wars. So they have
[52:29.820 --> 52:39.660]  the refuse fascism founder, the founder of Antifa, the Antifree speech group up there
[52:39.660 --> 52:48.100]  literally lying out of both sides of his mouth. And it's just the spiel of one of these dirty
[52:48.100 --> 52:55.460]  scumbags with this other dirty pimp that just goes around and gets all this dirty, dirty
[52:55.460 --> 53:00.740]  money from all these foreign dictatorships and then brings it here to crap leftist poison
[53:00.740 --> 53:13.540]  down our throats. So that's what's happening here. That's what's unfolding. That's who
[53:13.540 --> 53:18.660]  these people are. And they think you're weak and they think you're stupid and they think
[53:18.660 --> 53:24.700]  that they're going to be absolutely able to crush you. And they believe it's their right
[53:24.700 --> 53:31.900]  to do this. And they're nothing but dirty, lazy, pseudo-intellectual academics that want
[53:31.900 --> 53:37.660]  military power over you and your family. And they think you're so stupid that when they
[53:37.660 --> 53:41.020]  ran full page ads New York Times a year ago calling for the violent overthrow of Trump,
[53:41.020 --> 53:44.980]  I met in a national news story and they came out and said, there is no full page ad the
[53:44.980 --> 53:49.060]  New York Times calling for the overthrow of Trump. Jones made it up. And I had family
[53:49.060 --> 53:52.980]  and friends calling going, I went and got the New York Times. It's in it. Why would
[53:52.980 --> 54:00.380]  they lie like that? And I said, they lie openly to train you to accept it. They're not just
[54:00.380 --> 54:07.300]  doing this as an act of arrogance. It's an act of breaking your will. A 300 pound man
[54:07.300 --> 54:12.460]  can identify as a woman and win every powerlifting contest. Men with testicles can run against
[54:12.460 --> 54:17.460]  your daughters in high school, track and beat them and every girl loses and all the new winners
[54:17.460 --> 54:22.420]  of all sports that are female will be men. And women will sit there in a giant cult and
[54:22.420 --> 54:33.100]  allow it and so will we. Two plus two equals 10. Their mothers and fathers are bad. This
[54:33.100 --> 54:41.740]  is the cult of control. This is the operations. This is how they do it. And they're coming
[54:41.740 --> 54:47.380]  and they think they rule you and they think they own you. And let me stop there. Before
[54:47.380 --> 54:51.460]  we start to next hour, let me get into bar first, taking the gloves off, pulling the
[54:51.460 --> 54:59.340]  knives out, putting a bulldog in. So the specialty is inditing and imprisoning corrupt FBI agents
[54:59.340 --> 55:06.580]  dealing with illegal spies. So get ready for those first dominoes to fall. As I said, they're
[55:06.580 --> 55:13.580]  going to get struck and page first and a few others and then all the dominoes will fall.
[55:13.580 --> 55:18.340]  Please remember, we have the best supplements, the best products you're going to find anywhere
[55:18.340 --> 55:26.620]  out there in the world at the highest quality, the cleanest, the best. I want you to have
[55:26.620 --> 55:32.220]  the best. Plus I know they're going to test it all. We better be giving you the best. We
[55:32.220 --> 55:36.220]  better be giving you the cleanest. Well, we've been able to sign a year contract and get
[55:36.220 --> 55:41.580]  secret 12 to double its content of mythical bollum and the highest quality B12 you can
[55:41.580 --> 55:47.660]  find anywhere, the market leader, the most expensive, the best, the creme d'ala creme
[55:47.660 --> 55:53.780]  and we're able to now double the strength of secret 12. But you've got to change the
[55:53.780 --> 55:57.380]  label and change the name when you change the formula. These are just a plus, but people
[55:57.380 --> 56:06.020]  don't get what that means. So we named it ultra 12, ultra 12. Same as secret 12, mythical
[56:06.020 --> 56:11.140]  bollum and there's twice as much and then out of the gates, 50% off because I want you
[56:11.140 --> 56:15.420]  to see how amazing it is. Take it under the tongue for better absorption or just put your
[56:15.420 --> 56:20.660]  water right down. Folks don't know about B12. Most of it's synthetic and that still gives
[56:20.660 --> 56:26.460]  you a kick. This is the real deal, especially for Northern Europeans who genetically can't
[56:26.460 --> 56:32.500]  absorb B12. It's a lifesaver. I was genetically tested by medical doctors four years ago.
[56:32.500 --> 56:39.860]  I was found to have all the genes turned off for B12. My mitochondria have 100% operation
[56:39.860 --> 56:43.860]  that's almost unheard of. I'll bring that report and I'm pretty weird. They're actually
[56:43.860 --> 56:52.260]  shocked by it. They ran it again. 100% mitochondrial energy output. But three of the four genes
[56:52.260 --> 56:58.180]  are turned off to get energy into my mitochondria. And then I've got both the genes turned off
[56:58.180 --> 57:03.220]  for absorbing B12. There's another sub gene that has a side gene and the point is that
[57:03.220 --> 57:08.260]  I can't absorb it. My guts, I got to absorb it through blood. So that's a shot, which
[57:08.260 --> 57:12.700]  I don't like to do or under the tongue. This is the best medical bollum and ultra 12. If
[57:12.700 --> 57:16.220]  everybody just gets it, it's good for you. You need it. Your children need it. Your wife
[57:16.220 --> 57:18.940]  needs it. Your husband needs it. Your brother needs it. Your employees need it. If you'll
[57:18.940 --> 57:23.740]  just buy it, it's the best B12 out there at the lowest price you'll find at 50% off.
[57:23.740 --> 57:29.460]  That funds our operation. So everyone get your ultra 12 today. 50% off out of the gates
[57:29.460 --> 57:33.580]  at m4warslife.com. And don't forget, we've got to end it the next few days. A free bottle

[57:49.220 --> 57:54.580]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[57:54.580 --> 57:58.660]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[57:58.660 --> 58:03.740]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[58:03.740 --> 58:07.460]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[58:07.460 --> 58:11.980]  third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[58:11.980 --> 58:17.180]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[58:17.180 --> 58:23.020]  from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our original secret
[58:23.020 --> 58:27.940]  12 that was incredibly high quality metal bottle and double the strength of it in a
[58:27.940 --> 58:34.380]  new formula, ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest highest quality B12 over the
[58:34.380 --> 58:38.780]  counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing. Experience pure, metha cabalamin
[58:38.780 --> 58:45.820]  B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com,

[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:36.700]  month-line report. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:45.700]  Alright, coming up at the bottom of the hour, John Rappaport, formerly of nomorefakenews.com,
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.380]  an investigative journalist, he got his website just deleted after 18 years because he was
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:55.460]  criticizing vaccines as a consumer. He dared to read the inserts and tell you about it.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.180]  You're not allowed as a consumer of medical stuff to say something's bad or you had a
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.660]  bad reaction. Keep your mouth shut. Just take your damn shots, have your convulsions, get
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:13.660]  that six-foot grave and shut up. Shut up. Do not read the inserts. Take it. Have a convulsion.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:19.420]  Bear your child. God almighty, you people. Make me sick. Dramas, he's coming up. He doesn't
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:27.340]  know he makes me sick. How dare he have that free speech. Shut your filthy mouth, Rappaport.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:34.700]  There's a film about shutting your filthy piehole. You can'twatchthis.com and it's not
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.580]  a sponsor. I'm just plugging it because it's good to have a well-made film out there showing
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:48.300]  our side of being censored. I mean, what about? It premieres tomorrow at 3 p.m. Central at
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:54.340]  youcan'twatchthis.com and since I mentioned that, I'm going to get to the Communist Party
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:58.140]  on the young Turks, not telling people who they are, calling for the violent overthrow
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.740]  of the U.S. government with all that foreign Qatari money, foreign money, putting commies
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:08.980]  on the air to overthrow the USA. In my way, I've got the chai comms here. Let me pull
[01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:14.340]  that up. Where's that in my stack? I can't find it. It's printed for me again, please.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:19.420]  China came out and said they're at war with the U.S. Isn't that nice? All these little
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:27.980]  friends, young Turks and others is helping because we're so weak and so blind and so
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:33.980]  watching our NFL and sitting on our thumbs. But I wanted to get to some of these clips
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:40.620]  from youcan'twatchthis, the movie that's coming out tomorrow. Let's go ahead and play Tommy
[01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:48.900]  Robinson and his family, how they're now in danger everywhere, from the loving, sweet,
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.580]  and lommas that just want to throw acid on your face. They just want to kidnap your
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.540]  daughter and put her in sex slavery. Come on, man. Here it is.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:06.940]  I think that very soon, time soon, then the relocation of my family will be needed, probably
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:17.300]  to another country. I think that time's coming because essentially they're there, they're
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:22.580]  there, they're the thoughts I've had to have, they're the discussions I've had to have.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:27.700]  Is it safe? No, it's not. Is it safe even from the government? No, it's not. It's not
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.460]  like we're just worrying about terrorists coming and killing us. In fact, my biggest
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.140]  fear is what the establishment are going to do. It's not what some jihadis are going
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:42.900]  to do. It's what they're going to do next. It's what they're working on now. As I sit
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:49.500]  here now, what are they planning in order to silence me? That's the biggest fear and
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:59.180]  the reality is I have three young children and a wife. It's not just me who's at risk.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.980]  So first rate done film, when I saw it, the first time I interviewed it was like eight
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.220]  months ago, and then they came again, and then it was like, boom, I saw it about three
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.340]  weeks ago. I was like, this is first rate. And so it's going out on Vimeo tomorrow for
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.620]  subscription or you can buy it. And then I guess they're going to make DVD soon or something
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:23.580]  else, but it's powerful. It's very, very timely. And I hope everybody goes and sees it. You
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.940]  can't watch this.com. And again, censoredmovie.com as we go right to the place where you can
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:35.220]  watch it tomorrow at 3pm. And if I had my brothers, I just put the sucker out for free,
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.500]  but I get they had to have the money to make it. And then, you know, just try to sell some
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.900]  DVDs, but here's the deal. They wouldn't have owned it. They wouldn't even let me put it
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:49.860]  out for free anyway. So hey, got to love the tip of the lap to kill our freedoms. Now let's
[01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:54.100]  hear a dirty commie call for overthrow in our country and take everything you've got

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:39.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Infowars.com because there's a war on for your mind. We
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:51.020]  are the dreaded. We are the vaunted. We are the hated Americans. And we are still dug
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:58.140]  in in Texas. Reaching out across the world to set brush fires in the minds of men and
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:04.020]  women everywhere. And the globalist cannot stand on the field of debate with us. And
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:10.340]  so like all the authoritarians that collapse down the skeletons of dust throughout the
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:20.100]  past, they're hitting the panic button and calling for our system to be silenced for
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:29.180]  us to be banished for a bank accounts to be taken. And yes, for us even to be arrested.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:37.180]  As we enter into our number two, let me get to an amazing little exchange. It's a 16 minute
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:48.340]  interview with a gibbering huckster liar spewing lies as fast as a gatling gun can fire lead
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:59.540]  down range. Andy Z never worked today in his life. Just like so many of these leftists,
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:03.780]  he's going to run everything. He's going to teach you how the whole world works. He goes
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:12.300]  on the Gulf dictatorship funded young Turks named after the genocide group that killed
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:19.260]  1.5 million Christians. He doesn't tell anyone that he's an avowed member of the Revolutionary
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:26.300]  Communist Party and the Revolution books. He doesn't tell you he's a founder of Antifa
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.700]  that believes Americans don't deserve free speech and can be put in reeducation camps
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.380]  like the weatherman said. Oh, he said all that before. He's written books. He's given
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:42.020]  speeches. And he commands the armies of day glow methods that are out there attacking
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:47.740]  our free speech and chanting out the only good cops or dead cops. And there he is with
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:56.900]  Sink Turgor of the young turds, who himself reportedly made over $100 million himself.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:02.100]  50 plus million from Gulf War dictatorships. I mean, just, you know, jet airplanes, huge
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:08.820]  mansions, the $200,000 cars, and hey, free market, fine. No, no, no, no. He got it selling
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:16.460]  Sanders out. He got it from Gulf War dictatorships. So foreign countries funding a big fat person
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:24.100]  that hates America. And then in slithers, a little sneaky, wakey, Andy Z. Now remember,
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:30.460]  we have Beijing calls for people's war against the US is Trump threatens tariffs on another
[01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:39.220]  300 million of Chinese goods in all out trade war. So just remember, China has no environmental
[01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:45.460]  standards, Mexico, India, none. But this guy says, we've got a toxic America. We can't
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.660]  have jobs here. People might not want to be communists if they get a job and make a nice
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.980]  living and feel good about themselves. You've got to have a racial chip on your shoulder.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:10:03.900]  You've got to be upset. You got to be led by me, Andy Z. And these guys literally pull
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:08.940]  up and get out of their $200,000 cars, literally private jets, helicopters, all nine yards,
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.860]  that full page ads all over the country. George Soros funded. Remember this couple years ago?
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.980]  The nightmare must end. The Trump Pence regime must go to number fourth about year and a half
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:23.940]  ago, drive them from power. I said, look, this full page ad, New York Times, MSNBC,
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:29.100]  said it doesn't exist. You said, but anybody can look at the New York Times and it's about
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:33.300]  them training their listeners that they're liars. And the listeners go, oh, wait, we're
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:39.180]  in on a lie. We just deny whatever nationalists say. Exactly. Military training is what that
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:44.740]  is during assaults. You have your tank broadcast and this is on assault hands up, then they
[01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:50.460]  shoot you. So that's a standard tactic from World War One.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:56.660]  So imagine who these people really are. Now, no, I'm not going to play with a few minutes
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:01.460]  this because I got to stop it constantly because everything he says is a lie. And he says it
[01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:08.860]  real quick. He goes, Trump tells his viewers and his supporters to shoot people. And then
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:15.380]  he goes, or actually he tried to get somebody to say that in a rally, total lie, but he's
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:22.060]  adding provisos as fast as he goes, wind up another dirty, lazy, beating it, want to
[01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:28.660]  be controller. Who's just a nobody, but he runs his mouth with all the talking points
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:33.380]  like diarrhea, squirting out. He doesn't believe you have free speech, but he's got all the
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:41.860]  speech he wants. This is a real fascist, Andy Z with the young Turks calling for a violent
[01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:51.860]  overthrow. So the young Turks interview the founder of Antifa, call for violent revolution.
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:56.380]  Young Turks call for violent revolution with the founder of Antifa. Now, remember, I was
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.260]  de-platformed on the big line that I said, kill journalists with battle rivals. Now, I
[01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:04.940]  said, Antifa says they're coming to your house to kill you. Members of Congress, law enforcement,
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:09.420]  you better have your battle rifle ready to defend yourself. I'm going to talk to Carlson.
[01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:17.700]  Let's see. In the alchemy of a dirt bag, of a beatnik, of a Gaddio, of a Matt, homie,
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:24.820]  he knows how to play it on you, doesn't he? You talk about scum. You talk about trash.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:29.980]  You talk about anti-American filth. They would Soviet this country so fast it'll make your
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:38.020]  head spin. That's what they want, violent overthrow. He's licking his lips because he's
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:43.660]  got an inferiority complex to run your life. And here he is talking to another sack of
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:51.340]  garbage, a lying fraudster that says George Soros is a victim of holocaust and a hero
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:57.900]  of World War II when he said he was an Aussie collaborator. Sink the turd. Now, listen to
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:02.580]  the lies. Listen to it. Trump's for war. Trump's launched all these wars. Just all of it, just
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.900]  spewing garbage. Here it is.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:10.700]  Great guest for you guys. Andy C. is in the studio. Good to have you with us again, Andy.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.700]  Appreciate it.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.700]  Thanks for having me.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:18.900]  Andy's spokesperson for Revolution Books, and he also does refusefascism.org. But he's
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:23.700]  got a new project out. You think you're woke, but you're sleeping through a nightmare. This
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.300]  system cannot be reformed. It must be overthrown.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:31.180]  Yeah, overthrow the borders, overthrow the family. We get it. He doesn't tell you the
[01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:39.860]  guy's own admission is revolutionary Communist Party leader. He's one of the top five leaders.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:47.100]  He doesn't go. Here's one of the top commies. He's always a bookstore guy. He's nobody.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.660]  Now the guy starts spewing the lies. Here it is.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.020]  So first, what does that mean?
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:14:00.220]  Okay. Well, the actual title is your sleepwalking through a nightmare. You think you're woke.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:02.260]  What it means is that people are not actually.
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.420]  I'm sleepwalking through a nightmare. Am I in Venezuela or North Korea or Soviet Russia
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:11.900]  or Communist China? Would I have no rights? I'm sleepwalking through the nightmare that
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:16.420]  everybody's trying to get here. All the illegal aliens. Get all the free crap. Because we're
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.140]  so damn bad. Here, let's go back to it.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.820]  Acting commensurate with the fact that we face, on the one hand, a fascist regime. They're
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:29.180]  also not acting commensurate with the fact that we have a system that is literally destroying
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.620]  lives and destroying the planet.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:34.740]  But again, back it up 20 seconds.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.660]  We have a system that's fascist. No, you say anti-free speech. You wear black. You go around
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.780]  and people attack. You're a violent revolutionary communist. That is, you want blood. You want
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:53.660]  death. That's the credo. The red terror. And you use our open free society to do all this.
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:54.660]  Let's continue.
[01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:59.380]  Think your woke. What it means is that people are not actually acting commensurate with
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:03.420]  the fact that we face, on the one hand, a fascist regime. They're also not acting commensurate
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.420]  with the fact that we have a system that is literally destroying lives and destroying
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420]  the planet.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:13.980]  There's an existential question posed for the future of humanity with the environment.
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:19.540]  There's an existential question posed with, in fact, even the last week, Trump ratcheting
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:24.780]  up the situation with Iran. And this is a guy who said, if we have nukes, why can't we use
[01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.780]  it?
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:29.820]  These questions are posed. And this comes from a system that can't actually be reformed,
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:37.140]  where you have underlying problems like oppression of women, oppressed nationalities, black people,
[01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:39.140]  mass incarceration.
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.420]  Stop right there.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:47.380]  Trump is the one doing prison reform. The Democrats, the one that put it in. Again, everyone's
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:50.140]  trying to get into the country, but you say we're the most oppressive in the world. You're
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:57.980]  a dirty, lying commie that flies around in private jets with that demon Soros' tit.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:03.340]  Fellow patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate dot com. Like you,

[01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:23.340]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show. From the front lines of the Information War, it's
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:32.660]  Alex Jones. There's an existential question posed with, in fact, even the last week, Trump
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:37.940]  ratcheting up the situation with Iran. And this is a guy who said, if we have nukes,
[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:42.580]  why can't we use it? These questions are posed. And this comes from a system that can't actually
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:50.340]  be reformed, where you have underlying problems like oppression of women, oppressed nationalities,
[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.940]  black people, mass incarceration, the environment, these endless wars. All of this and the question
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:03.340]  of immigration, which is just this last week, he said, why can't we just shoot immigrants?
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:08.420]  Or he go to his audience to say that. So in all of this, people are faced with two choices.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:15.460]  And two choices in both regards. One, are you going to go along with this regime or are
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:22.140]  we going to act to drive it out? When will enough be enough with that? And two, in a
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:27.100]  more fundamental sense, how can you go along with the system that does this? There's another
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:28.100]  choice.
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:36.380]  No, let's stop right there. You're looking at the founder of Antifa, one of the leaders
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:41.100]  of the Revolutionary Communist Party that calls for violent blood in the streets, execution
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:48.500]  of police, reeducation camps. This is the weatherman, basically. Full page ads calling
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:53.020]  for the overthrow of the U.S. government so that we can live like Venezuela or North Korea
[01:21:53.020 --> 01:21:59.620]  or communist China or Russia and the Soviet Union. And he says Trump's oppressing women
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:02.860]  that minorities are oppressed here that were the worst country in the world and that we're
[01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:06.940]  keeping the black people in prison, but that's the Democrats and the system trying to create
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:11.060]  a class war and Trump's trying to fix it. And that, oh, Trump wants all these wars when
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:15.300]  Trump tried to get us out of Afghanistan and Syria and has cut the trips back to nothing
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.020]  in many of those areas.
[01:22:17.020 --> 01:22:23.940]  So when you're informed, it's all another dirty, stupid, lying, rich academic with
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:29.260]  Singh Ugar who gets his hundreds of millions from the Soros and Gulf states and they all
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:38.740]  fly around in private jets. Word is, Singh makes more money than Rush Limbaugh. These
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:47.540]  people all are filthy, rich. They fly on private jets. I don't fly on private jets. It's okay
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:54.420]  if I did, but I'll put the money back in this operation to fight them. I just can't ever
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:59.980]  see spending that much money. The point is, these are pigs. They tell you don't eat hamburger,
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:05.940]  but they damn well eat it. They tell you the world's ending if you don't do what they say.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:11.340]  And then that fascist, dangerous person's antifa movement says, take my speech away.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:16.060]  Hit me in the head with a bike lock. Drag me out of a restaurant because I'm a fascist
[01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:22.460]  because I don't deserve speech when he is the fascist trying to take our speech. I've
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:27.780]  been really working to not have this turn into a violent war, but let me tell you something.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:35.740]  The people that have been pushing for it, if they ever get it, better run like Trotsky
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:42.980]  like a rabbit because there's going to be nowhere on earth that dirty commies like
[01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:48.140]  him that start this fight are going to be able to run. The Santa Claus making a list
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:53.660]  and checking it twice. I'm seeing who's not in nice. And you want to target people. You
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:24:00.420]  want to threaten people. You're a coward and you're going to pay. And that young Turk's
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:05.460]  going to pay as well. God, we're going to beat these people. But that's why we need
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:09.100]  your prayers. That's why we need your support because these are such dirt. It's a long interview.
[01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:12.540]  I watched the whole thing. He just over and over again overthrow the government. Trump's
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:16.940]  the fascist. He's not legitimate. We're going to take over. We're going to rise up with
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:23.460]  the oppressed people's classic liberation theology, Ford Foundation, race war, weatherman
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:32.500]  crap with a big fat monster whose ancestors conquered the Byzantine Empire and sold their
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:39.020]  women into slavery. The young turd who names his group after the Armenian genocide of
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:46.420]  a million and a half Christians and who sits there filthy rich just like Bernie Sanders
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:54.100]  telling you, you can't have a damn dime. These people are cancer. My Lord, are they
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:25:01.860]  disgusting? And the Turks, young turd, celebrating our deplatforming, calling for us to be totally
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:08.980]  removed from air period, monsters, the dangers to everyone. And after the interview, they
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:14.740]  probably went out and had $500 bottle of wine and caviar. Just like the organ dealers that
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:20.180]  talk about their yellow Lamborghinis. But on TV, they're liberal and they promise everybody
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:24.300]  free stuff. Oh, you'll get free healthcare. Oh, you'll get free housing. Oh, you'll get
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.860]  free everything. You don't have to even have a job. If you don't want to work, you get
[01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:33.940]  everything free except for everybody else that has to work for you. So you tell us how
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:39.500]  America sucks and everybody wants to get in here. My God, I look to put these commies
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.740]  on an island with themselves because none of them want to work. None of them can even
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:48.780]  wipe their stinking asses. Let's go back to this dirty little pseudo intellectual. Here
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:53.060]  he is because he thinks he owns your ass. That's a predator right there, boy. That's
[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.420]  an anti-American filth. Here he is possible to actually make a revolution. And we're
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:03.300]  starting to organize for that now, even as that's not immediately on the agenda. So Andy
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:09.620]  you're pausing and back it up. They're organizing their revolution. And we've infiltrated it.
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:13.780]  You know, it's come out. FBI says they're a terror group. Says they're planning to kill
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:19.020]  law enforcement. They're planning to open the borders up. And then they got media platform
[01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:24.820]  saying that I did that. Well, let me just tell you, like I said, buddy, boy, you get
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.740]  your violent revolution going. I know it's not going to go well for you, but I can assure
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:39.540]  you you specifically, you specifically are, are, are, you're not in Kansas anymore, buddy.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:42.780]  You're not going to push us around anymore. Let's go back to this, this enemy. Here it
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:47.260]  is possible to actually make a revolution. And we're starting to organize for that now,
[01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:50.900]  even as that's not immediately on the agenda.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:58.700]  So Andy, I want to get to how you're going to drive them out in a minute. Pause again.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:02.980]  Everything he says is a lie. It's always a lie. Trump's keeping the blacks in prison.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:09.460]  Just reverse that. Trump suppressing the black people, lowest unemployment ever. Trump once
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:14.100]  used to divide you. This guy's trying to divide you. He just said, we are planning our violent
[01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:19.300]  revolution. It's just not on the agenda right now. They have it fired up and ready. Their
[01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:25.940]  weapons are ready.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:29.620]  And they keep telling us we're going to attack the press. We're going to attack them. See
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:38.860]  how that works? God, I mean, you would look at how pathetic those two men are, but then
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:47.820]  you realize how pathetic are we? I mean, that is what is contending to destroy our country.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:55.980]  The most lying, larcenous, diseased, twisted, evil, controlling, needle-dicked people the
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:02.860]  planet's ever seen with a hard on for you and your country. Let's finish up with these
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:03.860]  guys.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.860]  You do talk about, I think, two distinct problems. They're different problems. And I'm curious
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.860]  how you-
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:13.140]  Pause again. I'm going to come back. Let me tell you, young turd, you ain't pulling your
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:19.260]  Armenian crap on me. Just get it through your bloodthirsty fat vampire bat head. Go back
[01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.260]  to him.
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:25.580]  Nice fighting them. One is the Trump-Pence regime, which I think Pence is actually more
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:32.340]  of a traditional Republican. So let's say mainly the Trump regime, which is not necessarily
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:34.060]  part of this system.
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:38.580]  They go into their whole over throw, how they're going to blow, you know, over throw the government,
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:44.340]  take everything you got. It's all FEMA camps. They're coming. It ain't going to be like
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:51.780]  Armenia, needle-dick, you bloodthirsty tech, you enemy of everything decent, you big murderous,
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:57.500]  wannabe maggot, enemy.
[01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:01.100]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

[01:29:58.260 --> 01:30:03.620]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:07.700]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:12.740]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.500]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:21.020]  third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:25.540]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest-quality
[01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:31.140]  supplements for the forestlife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:36.460]  original Secret 12 that was incredibly high-quality Methylcobalamin and double the strength of
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:42.220]  it in a new formula, Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest-quality
[01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:47.100]  B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing. Experience pure
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.660]  Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the

[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:03.580]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:08.060]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all

[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:28.340]  Raw and unfiltered by Globalist Propaganda. It's the Alex Jones show, tomorrow's news
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:49.820]  today. The Globalist social engineers crave power over humanity more than anything else.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.620]  And they're so angry there's a spirit of resistance against them. But it's not just
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:34:00.580]  InfoWars being censored. Anyone saying you should read vaccine inserts, anyone saying
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:05.820]  you should research a major medical commodities out there that the governments and others
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:11.780]  are lobbying to make mandatory, you as a consumer are supposed to shut up. You're not supposed
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.180]  to read the inserts. You're not supposed to know that they're not doing safety tests.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:20.500]  You're not supposed to know they've got liability protection. And now, across the board, there
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.380]  is a giant all-out assault to shut down our free speech. He hadn't been on in probably
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:28.660]  six months if you're taking care of a sick family member. Let's get a journalist, John
[01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:33.180]  Rabaport joins us in just about one minute. They took down his NoMoreFakeNews.com from
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:38.860]  his hosting provider, which again, it's been very hard to transfer over. We've been trying
[01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:43.580]  to work with him to get it back up. I believe we have done that. But the point is, is that
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:53.100]  this is the climate we are now in, that there is an all-out war against even sites that have
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:57.020]  big archives that aren't being updated a lot, because people are searching and they're
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:01.260]  finding the interviews and the medical doctors and the research. They don't want that. They
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.740]  want a new dark age. They tell you what you can see, what you can read, the elitism of
[01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:11.660]  that, and tells them, well, what we're saying is dangerous. Oh, like lying about WMDs at
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:16.500]  the New York Times, you're seeing it. So we'll go to John Rabaport with NoMoreFakeNews.com
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:29.180]  here in just a moment. So we're still working with him on trying to get it back up. I guess
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:35.740]  is that a way back machine? Shot of that there that you have for me on screen for TV Bears?
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:41.740]  Yeah. So again, the front page, because I've been real busy. I know it was taken down a
[01:35:41.740 --> 01:35:45.500]  few days ago. We've been trying to help him get it back up. So the front page works, but
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:48.740]  not the rest of it. And again, this is bigger than John Rabaport's website. We're not just
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:53.220]  here bitching that somebody's website got taken down by the service provider for terms
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:59.020]  of service violation. It's happening to basically everyone. And it's happening en masse. We'll
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:04.300]  talk to him here in just a moment. First off, do not forget and understand without your
[01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:08.340]  financial support will be wiped out as kind of this mother ship that's trying to support
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:12.900]  everybody else. We make it easy. We have the best coffee in my view. People love it. Five
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:18.140]  star reviews by the thousands. We have the best B12 now ultra 12 twice as strong as
[01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:24.980]  the original super popular secret 12 50% off right now. We have the best iodine X2 with
[01:36:24.980 --> 01:36:29.460]  a free bottle of X3. That's amazing. That special is about to end. We have so many other
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:35.340]  big specials at info or store.com t shirts, books, films, whatever you do, realize it's
[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:38.700]  your purchase of products that makes it all possible. I want to commend you and thank
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:44.660]  you for your support. I want to commend you and thank you for your prayers, your word
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:49.380]  of mouth. We're in a fight. You're in a fight. They're trying to extinct your speech right
[01:36:49.380 --> 01:36:55.820]  now. So John, getting into big picture here after we talk about zooming in on what happened
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:37:00.460]  to you. You're an investigative journalist becoming on the show probably 18 years as
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:04.860]  long as you've had the site, but I saw you in TV shows and films and articles and you've
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:09.020]  done research for top national news shows. I'm going to go over your old bio. You've
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:13.500]  written articles and politics and health. You know, for the Los Angeles Times, you've
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.860]  been syndicated radio TV. I'm not going to go over it all, but no more fake news.com.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.500]  You're on Twitter at John Rappaport, I guess for now, but your site just disappears and
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:27.460]  you violated terms or whatever. This is part of this larger purge. Why do you think this
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:31.060]  is happening? Where is it going? And tell us specifically what happened to your site.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:37.700]  Thanks for coming on with us. Yeah, good to be here, Alex, in a while. So basically
[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:46.180]  what's happened here is last Saturday without warning or notice. Wordpress, as you can see
[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:53.060]  from what you put up on the screen, took down my blog. There it is. Now on my website, which
[01:37:53.060 --> 01:38:02.180]  is nomorefakenews.com, it's been there for 18 years now. If you click on the headlines,
[01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:07.140]  you would ordinarily go to the blog and get the articles under those headlines, but now
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:13.340]  you can't. So if you go to nomorefakenews.com in the upper left corner, you can still sign
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:19.740]  up for the email list and get my articles every day in your inbox. But basically without
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:28.500]  warning or notice or reason or any advance, anything after 10 years of having this blog
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:37.180]  posted by WordPress, bang, it was gone instantly between 2 and 3 p.m. last Saturday afternoon.
[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:46.500]  So people said, well, why is that? What happened? Well, if we try to communicate with WordPress
[01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:52.540]  so far, as far as I know, we get nothing back. So how do we know? But if I had to make an
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:58.820]  educated estimate, I would say that my articles on vaccines have been the most controversial
[01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:04.700]  because I've written so many of them over the years and pointed out the toxic, poisonous
[01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:10.100]  nature of the chemicals and the germs that are being injected into babies and children
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:16.100]  and adults all over the world and how the medical cartel is defending this practice as
[01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:21.780]  a modern miracle when it's actually a way of destroying life and reducing it down to
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:27.460]  the lowest common denominator. So I guess you could say that that's a little bit controversial
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.380]  and it's the sort of thing that they don't want anybody to be saying. They don't want
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:38.300]  anybody to be hearing because as you let off at the top with, this is a big push on their
[01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:46.540]  part to shut down all manner of free speech about vaccines, period.
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:50.540]  And it's really remarkable. I mean, we're seeing these reports everywhere. They admit,
[01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:59.300]  they say, hosting services, colleges, universities, medical facilities, they're firing nurses
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.860]  that say, hey, you better watch out or hey, I saw kids get hurt. It's in the insert, it
[01:40:02.860 --> 01:40:08.100]  can kill you. It's your right as a consumer to talk about what's happening. But remember,
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:13.020]  we've got this video, the play after the break, where we have CBS News, you name it, saying
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:17.700]  mercury's good for your brain. Well, no, it's the fact that mercury eats your brain. It's
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:21.980]  a electrochemical disruptor. So again, you have this extensive site, a lot of it about
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:26.820]  vaccines, it just disappears. So first is take us off these platforms. Now it's take
[01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:32.740]  the anti-vaxxers off. That is so scary to say that a mother can't say her son had a
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:37.700]  convulsion and died or her son had a convulsion and got brain damage. We took a third round
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:44.100]  of shots as a consumer to have liability protection and to have no safety studies, they admit,
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.620]  and to let these companies be immune. And now we can't even say when they make us take
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:55.380]  it and hurt us. My Lord, that's incredible. Incredible, absolutely unbelievable. And people
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:41:00.500]  have to recognize this. I mean, people who listen to your show, who read my articles,
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:07.180]  who go to other websites, who are just starting to question the status quo, they have to recognize
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:15.940]  what's going on here. This is a fight, a battle, a war about the truth versus death.
[01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:20.900]  Well, when I heard this Saturday that they had destroyed your site, I hoped you had a
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:25.460]  backup. I got you with my IP guy so that we could hopefully host it for you, get it re-uploaded,
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.700]  so that those links via URL are still there because I know your site's linked millions
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:34.500]  of times across the web, still gets millions of visitors every month, mainly on vaccines.
[01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:38.660]  That's why you were blown up. So people couldn't see all your great journalism, your research,
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:44.220]  all the peer reviewed stuff that you had linked to. What's the current, because I really feel
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:48.020]  impotent, if we couldn't help you get your site back?
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:56.860]  The current status right now is the site itself, we're attempting to put up the blog again
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:02.980]  by other means, let's say, okay, in other words, not by using the current setup, okay?
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.700]  No, I know how the internet works, I understand how servers work, but I'm saying I put you
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:10.020]  in touch with my IT and I won't help if you don't want to help. I'm just saying it should
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:15.220]  be pretty easy if you have your website files to put it on another host.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:22.780]  Yes, okay, I've alerted my technical guy and he is in touch with your technical guy, that's
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:31.260]  what I know right now. But I can tell you this, if you go online and you type in a headline
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:37.660]  or a subject matter that I've written about and it says my name and the headline and WordPress,
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:42.820]  let's say you do that on Google and you click on that, you're going to get the same, the
[01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:44.460]  blog has been shut down.
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:49.180]  Yes, we understand, we know there's a massive firestorm of censorship going on and so that's
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.060]  why I just tried to immediately act to get it back up. I need victories, I want victories.
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:43:06.780]  I know we can talk all day about how they're f-ing us over, I get it.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:13.180]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:19.500]  energy drinks and energy supplements. But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic
[01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:23.780]  caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.860]  hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:32.460]  We have developed hands down from our research the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout
[01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:37.860]  and beyond system in the world. There's nothing else like it, you must experience it. It is
[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:43.500]  a total game changer and it comes in easy to use, packets to mix in with fruges or water,
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:48.020]  whatever you'd like. Warning though, it's very, very strong, it lasts 10 hours so take
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:52.220]  a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.380]  take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.580]  TurboForce and m4slife.com.
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:44:02.860]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:07.940]  here in Leilani Estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:11.500]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:16.900]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:23.700]  to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:28.500]  and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:30.300]  acidity in the rain water.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:35.620]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:41.900]  metal levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:47.660]  turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:53.900]  is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain water supply. But more importantly,
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:59.660]  a good water filtration system will purify it.

[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.900]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents knew that they can't food during the falls they
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:08.100]  have it during the winter. And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com. With

[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:24.980]  Okay, Alex Jones here back live. I'm a little frustrated. I'm going to be really honest
[01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:33.460]  with you, okay? We know there's an all out total takedown of any websites that question
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:38.820]  vaccines and damage from it. We know there's takedown of free speech. They're talking
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:46.380]  about taking the NRA out of banking. We're putting up with it and I swear I sit around
[01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:53.260]  and even talk to my IT people about the companies taking our servers away and lawsuits and we're
[01:47:53.260 --> 01:47:59.060]  being de-platformed everywhere. And people go, gee, you think it's political? It's like
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:04.540]  your house burned down and you're wondering if you had a fire. You've got ashes and we're
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:13.420]  discussing it's ashes. It's ashes. It's ashes. It's ashes. It'd be like a kid walks out the
[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:16.660]  street. It's run over by car. We're having a debate five years later whether or not they're
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:22.500]  six feet in the ground. You've got a bunch of globalist corporations gang raping the
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:27.940]  little oral hell out of our First Amendment. You've got anti-foam young Turks saying we're
[01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:37.300]  getting ready to overthrow the government and have a violent communist revolution.
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:43.220]  And we just sit here and take the censorship and take all these dirty criminal slimy people
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:49.380]  pissing all over us. And it's sick. Even if you're wrong about vaccines, it's your right
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:54.540]  to question them. And it's time for all of us to stop being so apologetic. Let's play
[01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:59.740]  this clip from K.I. Austin. This is from like 15 years ago. This went out nationwide by
[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:08.780]  the way. They have a CBS broadcast center and they sit out worldwide to everybody. And
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.620]  they said, Mercury is good for your brain. That's like saying, lead's good for your brain
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:18.060]  if you put a 45 to your head and stick it in your mouth and pull the trigger and shoot
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:22.300]  a bullet to the bottom of your brain, it feels real good. And you see pretty colors. You
[01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:37.740]  see that person's insane. Let's see. That's where we are. Mercury eats holes in your brain.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:43.340]  Mercury is the most electrochemically destructive heavy metal there is in the brain. Just research
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:50.060]  that in mainline medicine. It's not debated. But instead, they think you're so stupid.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:54.540]  They tell you, hey, pouring gasoline all over yourself and lighting yourself on fire is
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:58.500]  really good for you. And running a bunch of needles in your kid and giving them 50-something
[01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:01.780]  shots by the time they're 18 months old is a really good thing. And if you don't like
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:08.460]  that, we'll shut your ass up, you Americans. Keep your filthy American pie holes shot.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:14.580]  We'll go back to John Rappaport at NoMoreFakeNess.com. I'd like to help him, but we may not be able
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:19.020]  to. We'll see to try to get it back up. And it's not like the end of the world, John Rappaport
[01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:23.460]  going away or Alex Jones going away. It's everyone's freedoms going away. And we don't
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:27.540]  recognize the tyranny when it hits us at a mega load because we've been so living with
[01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.180]  it forever and putting up with it that when it finally breaks our necks, we don't even
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:37.300]  know what hit us. So here's CBS News saying mercury is mother's milk. Now, don't follow
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:41.900]  this. You give your kids some mercury, they'll die. Here it is.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:51:05.500]  Vaccines may have on kids. A life saving device wins over the counter approval by the FDA.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:10.020]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines might impair the
[01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:14.740]  neurological development of children. These new studies suggest that the opposite, that
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:20.100]  the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:24.660]  But if lower IQ and being retarded is improved behavior, well, then yes, it's all what goals
[01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:28.180]  they want. So John, I love you to death. And I hate to see this happen to you. I'm not mad
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:32.140]  at you if I seem frustrated. I'm just pissed the general situation that we're debating
[01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:36.180]  whether you've been censored or not. I deleted your 18-year popular site off your provider
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:40.780]  and we're just trying to get you back up. But forget Alex Jones, forget John Rappaport.
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.300]  This is a system-wide thing. I want to get your take on that. But first, something you
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:48.060]  said that is intriguing and intelligent and to the core of this. You've got your main
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:52.940]  page back up. People can go there and sign up for your email to get your articles for
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:59.580]  free. And that's why to listeners, go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and put your name
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:04.180]  in there, folks. They're fighting around the clock to keep us from being able to ever
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:08.300]  have contact with you. And if they're able to continue this censorship, as hell, baby
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:13.180]  Trump said on it, I don't know, if this is able to continue on, the only way will be
[01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:20.100]  email. So infowars.com forward slash newsletter. John, again, no more fake news.com. Everyone
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:24.380]  should go to their favorite site or people they trust and they should sign up for email
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:28.540]  so we can all keep communicating via email and via text message. Which CNN, as you know,
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:33.500]  last week, I'm sure you saw it, said they want to take my texting away on iPhones. They
[01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:37.700]  don't want me to be able to have a telephone. That's the new level of this rabbit port.
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:43.660]  Unbelievable. And as I was saying, if it isn't Mercury, it's aluminum, which is another universally
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:51.980]  recognized toxin that is in many, many vaccines all over the world. So they're acting like
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:57.700]  as you saw in the clip, everything is fine. Two new studies show that the most poisonous
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:02.300]  substance in the world is actually good for you. And people go, Oh, well, that's great
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:10.060]  and everything is okay. Terrific. Wonderful. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. And if you think
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:16.620]  you can avoid the issue of children's brains being destroyed all over the world, if you
[01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:22.420]  think that's something that you can just turn away from, good luck to you now and in the
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:29.260]  future. It's not. The chickens have already come home to roost. It's already happening.
[01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:33.900]  Alex has been talking about it. Other people have been talking and writing about it. I've
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:41.020]  been talking and writing about it since probably 1987. And I continue to do so because it just
[01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:50.580]  seems like the right thing to do to say people, Hey, watch out. Watch out. You're free. You're
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:56.780]  not a slave unless you decide to be unless you want the brains of the people you love
[01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:03.900]  to be destroyed. This is the choice you have. And if you don't stand up for it, if enough
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:13.420]  people don't stand up for it, the entire planet goes down. I mean, down. That's what's happening.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:18.020]  And I can't help but just get energized and angry. And I don't think Trump's in on the
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:22.660]  censorship. Obviously, he's been under censorship himself, but they keep brainwashing him at
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:26.020]  the Heritage Foundation. I know it's a private company. No, the Supreme Court just ruled
[01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:30.940]  Apple. It let people in on their apps and is being prohibitive and they're controlling.
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:36.620]  They're all big monopolies working together to control and dominate people. And it's just
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:45.020]  classic antitrust action that's needed here. And they make a practice of not telling you
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:53.300]  why. It's almost as if nobody's looking at you. Nobody's saying anything. All of a sudden,
[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:59.180]  you're censored and cut off. And how do I even get in touch with these people to protest
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:06.140]  it or to ask for a reason or anything? They're not making it easy, folks. It's not, hey,
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:11.980]  listen, maybe we made a mistake contact. No, no, no, no, no, no. Or, hey, you're skirting
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:17.420]  on thin ice here. Watch out, blah, blah, blah. No, it's bang, you're gone. Bang, you're
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:24.540]  gone because the decision was made higher up on the food chain. And this big company,
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:29.380]  whatever it is, is going along. There's total purges going on everywhere. Matt, one of the
[01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:35.540]  great crew members just made a great point. Mark Zuckerberg is 35 today. And he was born
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:46.140]  in 1984. So Mark Zuckerberg equals 1984. What do you make, John, of how they came out two
[01:55:46.140 --> 01:55:50.860]  weeks ago, or almost two weeks ago now, and said, Alex is the most banned person. There's
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:56.780]  a special category for me. You may not say my name on Facebook or infoworks.com on Facebook
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:02.300]  unless it's in a negative light. So it's not like people could sue for negative reviews
[01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:06.980]  or whatever. I could sue for that. But the point is they're saying you must be prohibitive.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:11.980]  You must give Alex Jones a bad review. You must denigrate him. If you use this word,
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:19.900]  it must be a negative connotation. That's beyond any cult I ever heard about. Wow. Wow.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:24.820]  Look at this, White Plains, New York. That's where I grew up. How do you like that? I was
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:35.100]  long gone by 1984. Yeah. Okay. So CIA connected money, gave birth to Facebook, forget social
[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:40.580]  network and the various movies and so forth. Oh, it's declassified. It was a CIA project.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:46.500]  David Zuckerberg, they set the project down the day Facebook went public. Yeah. And look
[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:53.900]  at the stock chart and you'll see how classic moves in order to have insiders make gigantic
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:57:00.540]  amounts of money and get the speculators and the public and the the rubes out of the game
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:06.740]  and turn their shares over to the insiders. The stock has gone through the roof in a series
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:13.660]  of classic moves that any idiot who knows about the market could predict in front.
[01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:19.620]  And so people are making billions of dollars and shutting down free speech at the same time.
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:24.380]  This is their wet dream. This is what they're trying to do. This is what they are doing.
[01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:31.060]  And people have to stand up and find many, many ways to get around and over and under
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:36.820]  and through this. That's right, folks. This is a test of human will. John, let's come back
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:40.260]  and finish up where you think this is all going. Thank you so much. And Caitlin Bennett's
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:44.660]  coming up and I've got my report when I was on Turkish TV. It was explosive. It's all
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:48.180]  at info wars.com.
[01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:53.180]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:57.460]  over the years and that has stood with us. And I want to thank all of our sponsors and
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:58:01.860]  all of our affiliates. But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:06.180]  we've been under. You're our only sponsors. And when you don't buy the products that are
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:12.580]  absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on. So remember, you are the info
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:17.340]  war. I'm not the leader. You are the leader. When you take action, nothing stops you. We've
[01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:23.300]  got giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented. And if you go there
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:28.540]  and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:32.300]  American Revolution worldwide. So I want to thank you for your support. I want to encourage
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:38.900]  you again. Go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need. We have thousands
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:43.660]  of them and it makes this all possible. Thank you for making Info Wars possible. God bless
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:44.660]  you.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:53.900]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:59.140]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:05.900]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:11.780]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:17.180]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:22.580]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:28.780]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:33.340]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:38.620]  blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:44.980]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infoworselife.com
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:51.620]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.620 --> 02:00:04.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening
[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:11.100]  to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:47.500]  So, John Rebberport is a investigative journalist and for almost two decades, I knew him before
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:52.980]  that, his TV and radio shows and all of it, he had no more fake news.com and it just was
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:59.020]  kicked off. Again, it's happening to everybody. Like I said, the front page is still up. You
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:02.740]  need to go there, sign up for three emails so you still get those articles they don't
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:06.380]  want you to have so you can get them out to other people, so you can get aggressive in
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:12.060]  the third dimension. I've got a video of third dimension activism coming up next segment.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:14.940]  But John, just in closing, please come back and join us again soon. I know you've been
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:23.780]  very busy taking care of family and things. Your quasi retired, but it just, to have someone
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:28.020]  try to oppress your speech and to tell you, as I know somebody that did a lot of consumer
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:35.580]  advocacy reporting that you can't post a vaccine insert that by law you're supposed to be able
[02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:42.160]  to have, explain to people the adverse reactions. It's just next level and I'm wondering how
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.620]  far this is going to go if we put up with it.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:51.380]  Well, if we put up with it, it's going to go, you saw how far. You can't mention your
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:59.900]  name without a negative connotation. You can't mention info wars without a negative connotation.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:07.020]  I mean, this is like 1984 to the Hill. You can't mention somebody's name without attaching
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:12.620]  a negative connotation. Otherwise, you'll get kicked off a platform. I mean, this is
[02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:23.460]  like all out war and insanity on the part of people who, I don't know. I mean, these
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:30.100]  are evil people, evil down to the core. They have either started the evil or they've been
[02:02:30.100 --> 02:02:36.900]  co-opted into it, but either way, they've sucked it up and bought into it. They've traded
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:43.040]  their freedom and the freedom of everybody else for a few dollars or whatever it is that
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:48.780]  they're most interested in or most interested in hiding.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:55.080]  If it's blackmail and they believe that we'll put up with anything, yes, they believe we'll
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:03:00.620]  put up with anything. They're testing. How far will they go? What will they do if we
[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:09.100]  say, okay, you may not pronounce the name info wars. You can't say it. Just like you
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:15.820]  can't say the N word. You can only say N word. All right. So they're going to say now,
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:23.660]  you can't say info wars anymore. Is that the next step? You can say IW. Okay, we know what
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:29.500]  that means, but you can't actually pronounce the name of the website. That's too horrible.
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:38.460]  They could go there. If the public either buys it or is unaware and too stupid to respond,
[02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:43.620]  that's where it's going to go. One step after another, down, down, down.
[02:03:43.620 --> 02:03:49.180]  Well, it shows how bold these globalists are, but I believe in humanity. And I think with
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:52.780]  the oppression we're seeing, it's going to force a lot of innovation. What do you think?
[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:58.860]  I do. I've seen it already. People who otherwise would just absolutely keep their trap shut
[02:03:58.860 --> 02:04:06.700]  or have woken up already, and others will wake up. It's already happening. And we just
[02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:13.180]  have to make the connections among ourselves more secure. That's all.
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:16.940]  Well, I'll be honest with you. I don't want to say I'm depressed. I'm not. It's beyond
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:21.980]  that. It's just like I'm sad that humanity, after all we've seen in history repeating
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:27.420]  itself is doing it again. And I've read all these scientific dystopic novels and I've
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:32.460]  studied history. And this is like already as bad as it's ever been and getting worse.
[02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:38.220]  And I'm like, my God, this is like insane. Let's talk to you soon. My IT can help you.
[02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:42.700]  We'd like to get your site back up. Nomorefakenews.com. People still go there and send us your email.
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:47.020]  John Robbort, God bless you. We appreciate your great treatment. Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:50.700]  Listen, they want to shut you down because you told the truth. And you had medical doctors
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.980]  on and you put a great compendium together. We're going to get that back up. And they
[02:04:53.980 --> 02:05:00.060]  want to hurt our children. I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:06.300]  censorship. And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored,
[02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:14.700]  the most buried, the most suppressed. And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night
[02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:20.220]  all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt hurt
[02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:25.580]  when Trump won. They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember
[02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:30.700]  what political action did. And that's why the globalist, Hillary and others,
[02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:35.500]  are trying to shut in for us now. This is a fight about taking your speech away,
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:40.460]  not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:44.780]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[02:05:44.780 --> 02:05:47.900]  if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great
[02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:52.780]  products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water. I'm in your hands,
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:06:18.780]  you're in my hands, infowarstore.com. Thank you.
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:31.580]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:35.340]  broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:43.580]  There are a lot of ways to counter the globalist, but one of the biggest
[02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:49.980]  is third dimensional action. And at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to cover
[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:59.420]  an intriguing constellation of events that took place the last few days that separately
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:04.860]  together augment each other to give us a path to victory, but also very hilarious clips.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:11.100]  So that's coming up bottom of the hour. Mayor de Blasio inside Trump Tower trying to piss on
[02:07:11.100 --> 02:07:18.620]  Trump, even though Trump let him come in there. And then people counter acting against them in
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:23.260]  the third dimension that blowing up in their pathetic faces. That's all coming up bottom of
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:27.740]  the hour. AOC and others with more claims, the earth's going to end. I mean, this is cult
[02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:32.380]  programming. But let me get to this right now, because I said I would. This is a
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:37.660]  Howard Stern comedy piece that I guess happened this morning
[02:07:37.660 --> 02:07:46.620]  for TV and radio. And for TV, it is a lot funnier. Jimmy Kimmel is in studio with Howard Stern.
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:54.620]  And they have these puppets and this Alex Jones impersonator that actually takes real quotes
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:59.500]  I've said, and then just edits them together or strings them into other quotes. They don't
[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:06.620]  make sense. But I've never said that Jimmy Kimmel or George Soros are running child kidnapping
[02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:12.380]  ranks. I've said the UN's been caught. The globalists have been caught. WikiLeaks has all that.
[02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:17.420]  I'm talking about Soros trying to overthrow our country, trying to foment division,
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:25.020]  being a Nazi collaborator. You say, oh, well, this is satire. But people really believe I'm
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:29.740]  saying these things out of context. So I'm going to play the Stern piece. I'm going to play an
[02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:37.820]  extremely well thought out, documented, researched piece by Greg Rees. Are the Clintons involved
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:49.900]  in human trafficking? Do snails have shells? Do birds tweet? Do bears live in the woods?
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:57.580]  The article is up on infowars.com and newswars.com with the video. And then we go into all the
[02:08:57.580 --> 02:09:03.900]  traffickers around them and all the trafficking and all the coverups. It's powerful. So again,
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:10.620]  I want to say to Kimmel and everybody else, the system has put the talking point out everywhere
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:14.700]  to make jokes about Jones. And now there's no child kidnapping and there's no pedophilia.
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:19.820]  Nambla's out there. There's sexualizing kids everywhere. It's all over the news. They're
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:26.140]  coming after our children. That's admitted. And I don't think Howard Stern and Jimmy Kimmel want
[02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:36.460]  to be part of stuff like that. I think it's sick. I think it's dangerous. And again, it's serious.
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:40.780]  Look at the Catholic Church and all the pedophile rings, huh? Look at all the serious things we've
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:46.300]  talked about that have come out and turned out to be true. Children are a currency being used by
[02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:51.820]  this vampiric world government system. And they've got sorrows, eating babies in here,
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:55.980]  you know, all it's a big joke. What about five states passing laws that kill babies after they're
[02:09:55.980 --> 02:10:01.340]  born and harvest their organs? Howard Stern, you feel safe in a world where we don't value human
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:06.860]  life and we take babies and kill them? Last time that happened was Nazi Germany.
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:18.780]  So the Clinton's expiration dates have been out for a while. They're like rotten yogurt or rotten
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:25.020]  milk in the refrigerator. I mean, they were supposed to be put out to the curb years ago.
[02:10:25.980 --> 02:10:29.900]  That's supposed to be the landfill right now. But you've got all these cloistered,
[02:10:29.900 --> 02:10:36.140]  so-called elites hanging onto the system that still think the Clintons are cool. Little memo to
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:42.780]  Howard Stern, Clintons aren't cool. And I think you know that because some of these attacks are
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:48.620]  actually good at humor by Stern. Because he's done a bunch of these and I watch a lot of them.
[02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:52.860]  And we had a good interview when I was on Stern, I've been on his other shows a bunch.
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:11:00.700]  Obviously, I'm the hottest interview you can get. I mean, I'm one of the hottest interviews out there.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:09.980]  Joe Rogan's third and second biggest podcast are yours truly. Only Elon Musk has like 57 million
[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:14.060]  total with all the podcasts together. I've only got like 40 something million. But I'm climbing to be
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:18.540]  number one. So it's not like, oh, please have me on your show, Howard Stern. But you do have a big
[02:11:18.540 --> 02:11:23.260]  show. I'd like to speak for who I really am. And I'm a friendly, nice guy when I'm on. I'm gonna try
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:30.700]  to get points against you. But Stern needs to have me on. I've been on before. If Stern's his own
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:35.420]  man, he won't just have me as a puppet on there, saying things I never said, or things I didn't
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:41.420]  say out of context. So here's a Stern's report with Jimmy Kimmel this morning in New York,
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:47.740]  and then we'll come back with the real child trafficking. And guys, print me that Senate report.
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:52.300]  Washington Post Senate report confirms Obama shipped in kids for child kidnapping.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.780]  I want to show folks that we come back. But here it is. Thanks.
[02:11:55.420 --> 02:12:00.300]  You love Alex Jones on this show. You can't get Alex Jones anywhere else. The government has banned
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:07.180]  him. He's been removed from Facebook. And so the only place to hear his conspiracy theories and whacked
[02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:11.900]  out stuff is right here on the show. So because you love when he comes on our show, I've arranged
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:18.220]  today for you to talk and to enjoy Alex Jones. Let's go right to Alex and you can see him up on
[02:12:18.220 --> 02:12:45.740]  the screen here. By the way, you're having a tremendous I was just telling Jimmy you're
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:57.980]  having a bone broth. You eat the bone broth. It is so good. It's loaded with vitamin R. Listen,
[02:12:57.980 --> 02:13:01.340]  Jimmy, I know you're in New York right now for the annual Bilderberg meeting where the
[02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:04.940]  technocracy takes drugs in the temple and interfaces with the Palantir's for climate
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:10.060]  air control, the interdimensional connection. I know that right. No, he's in the town for
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:14.140]  something called the up front for ABC. Advertising event. That's not true. It's the Bilderberg
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:18.620]  meeting. Listen, I cover this all in my new book. Alex Jones exposes globalist pedophile
[02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:24.620]  cults again. Jimmy's in it and I'm in it. It's about my interviews. It's about Roger Stone.
[02:13:29.980 --> 02:13:33.820]  So everyone is excited that you're here this morning. What is going on? They've taken you
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:39.180]  off every media outlet. We can barely see you anywhere. We have been shadow banned up. By the
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:43.820]  way, I should mention I brought the panel in studio today. I brought the guys in. We got George Soros,
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:49.180]  Hillary Clinton, Arabo, Obama, the Triad of Evil. We're all here. That's your team. They're all
[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:53.660]  there with you. That is my team. George Soros. You know Jimmy Kimmel, right? You guys are friends.
[02:13:54.300 --> 02:13:59.420]  I haven't seen you since the Luciferian sacrifice. Hail Soros.
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:06.140]  Wow, friends reunited. It's beautiful, Jimmy. Who else is on your panel that you're talking to
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:11.500]  there about Jimmy? You got up the great Hillary Clinton over here. I'm the reptilian anti-Christ.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:17.100]  I love eating Mexican immigrants' arms and fingers. Thank you very much, Hillary. Howard,
[02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:20.380]  I know you used to have George Soros come on your show all the time when you guys were playing
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:25.340]  Wheel of Soros back in the day. Yeah. I love that. Back in 2002. Do you remember that? No.
[02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:27.420]  I'll prove it to you right now. Roll the clip. You'll see.
[02:14:27.420 --> 02:14:41.900]  Hey, now, it's time for Wheel of Soros. Hey, now, I'll ride Soros in that wheel.
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:47.260]  Okay. I hope it lands on babyfeast. Hail Soros.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:59.020]  Yes! Soros needs to feed.
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:09.260]  I don't remember that. I don't remember that. All right, Alex. I feel like 80% of that was
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:14.460]  lost to the radio audience. It was pretty great. I'll have a talk with Alex later.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:17.420]  I don't think you're innocent in this either. I know you're constantly calling for the Trans
[02:15:17.420 --> 02:15:21.420]  Species Endgame, the demonic experiments being done on lower hominids. You go on your show,
[02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:24.460]  you admit you're subhumanoid. I know you do this, Jimmy. Don't lie to me.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:29.020]  Well, you stop attacking Jimmy. Jimmy's my guest. I have a clip of Jimmy admitting he's subhumanoid.
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:36.460]  We also have to ask ourselves, have I been entirely truthful? I don't know about you,
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:42.300]  but I have not. I haven't been entirely truthful. I'll give you one example. These are my subhuman
[02:15:42.300 --> 02:15:49.100]  crab claws. All right, so the producer called something and said, Alex actually thinks this
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:53.980]  is funny, like I'm uptight, like I'm like them. I take myself serious. No, but making fun of
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:58.220]  dead kids is not funny. Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for

[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:05.420]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:11.900]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:17.740]  drugs. After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:23.340]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own,

[02:19:55.260 --> 02:20:17.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:25.260 --> 02:20:37.660]  All right, so, you know, here's the deal. I guarantee you I done more wild stuff than
[02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:43.260]  Howard Stern and Jimmy Kimmel combined ever have. Not bragging, it's just true. Everybody knows it.
[02:20:43.260 --> 02:20:50.540]  I just did politics, not just in life, everything. So I want all these cool New Yorker guys to get
[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:56.060]  stuff straight. I think New Yorkers are cool. But you guys think down here in Texas, like ride
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:04.460]  around on horses and stuff. I mean, I do that too. And you think, I can't believe the producer called
[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:09.980]  us and thought we were mad at this, but like, like, oh, you made fun of me. I'm going to go cry. I
[02:21:09.980 --> 02:21:17.740]  like being made fun of. I want to escape from stuff. I think a lot of times Howard Stern is
[02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:22.540]  very funny. He's very talented. I mean, sometimes the stuff goes too far, but that's his free speech
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:28.380]  right. And, you know, I've said it before, before we were having on the show, I said, Howard Stern,
[02:21:28.380 --> 02:21:34.060]  when you're driving across, you know, on a 10 hour road trip, he's very listenable compared to most
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:40.780]  shows where you want to blow your head off. This isn't some ass kissing thing towards Howard Stern,
[02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:48.060]  either. But the fact that when they had me on like, I don't know, eight, nine years ago, whatever
[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:51.740]  it was, and I was on a bunch of their other shows like 30 times or more, they go down. You're not
[02:21:51.740 --> 02:21:55.340]  going to try to sneak attack him on air. You're not going to try to like put him down or anything.
[02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:59.420]  And I'm like, is Howard Stern's not a wimp? No, I don't do that. I'm going to come on and talk
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:07.020]  about my issues. If he attacks me, I'll attack back. And they call up today and they're like,
[02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:14.700]  really, you're not mad. You don't, man, I don't know what's going on in this country. Okay.
[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:21.180]  But what mainstream media says I am, he's not who I am.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:28.940]  And it's bigger than Alex Jones. If they can rip, misrepresent who I am, Howard Stern,
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:37.260]  I've been on your network more than 30 times. Gosh, it's probably more than that.
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:41.820]  And you had polls and you said, my gosh, he may be the most popular guest we've ever had.
[02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:47.100]  It's the same thing on Joe Rogan. I'm not bragging. I'm popular. I'm regular.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:56.700]  Making a joke out of that crap at least five times today. The point is, I'm just a regular guy.
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:23:04.140]  So when all those times I went on your shows where you complicit in the last seven, eight years
[02:23:04.940 --> 02:23:10.940]  of Sandy Hook conspiracies, Howard, I never talked about Sandy Hook on your show or any
[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:21.100]  of your shows because I hardly ever talked about it, Howard. It's an obscenity that these
[02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:27.660]  Democratic Party lawyers, some of them federal prosecutors who are now private lawyers that
[02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:34.300]  are suing me are admittedly thinking we're like mafia dons and they're going to find some criminal
[02:23:34.300 --> 02:23:43.900]  stuff. These people are delusional. And so in my name, Howard, they keep saying I'm saying nobody
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:51.340]  died at Sandy Hook so they can exploit those dead kids some more. That's my view on it.
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:56.060]  It's like I was on George Norrie in LA a few months ago. I've been on his show over 100 times.
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:00.380]  He's a three-time Emmy award-winning journalist. He said, yeah, Alex,
[02:24:00.380 --> 02:24:05.580]  you've been on me, looked it up over 100 times, over 100 times, over 17 years.
[02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:13.500]  You've never talked about Sandy Hook on the show. Do you know what it's like to have people say,
[02:24:13.500 --> 02:24:18.700]  you're the Sandy Hook man and you did all this stuff out of two or three broadcasts edited deceptively?
[02:24:22.860 --> 02:24:28.300]  But see, I've learned a lot about how the scumbaggery works. Three years ago,
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:32.700]  Hillary started saying that I was a Sandy Hook man, that I was sending people to people's houses to
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.020]  harass their kids and to all the stuff that I hadn't done. And then the news she said,
[02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:42.140]  why don't you just apologize? You know, they never hurt anybody that you covered people's
[02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:48.460]  question. And I said, sure, I apologize. All hell broke loose because it was disingenuous.
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:55.420]  They just wanted me to say I was guilty of things I hadn't even done though it was still free speech.
[02:24:55.420 --> 02:25:02.300]  So it's so frustrating to see Howard Stern, who I remember growing up in Dallas when he was first
[02:25:02.300 --> 02:25:08.700]  really big on the radio. And I forget the name of the talk show he was doing on TV too, where you
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:13.020]  played bongos on people's butts and my dad laughing about it and everything, and me laughing.
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:18.940]  And then all the crazy stuff Howard Stern had on and all the tongue and cheek and all of it.
[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:22.380]  I mean, if you wanted by that yardstick to take what he'd said and done and edit together,
[02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:25.660]  you could sue him and do oblivion. I'm not saying you should. I believe in free speech.
[02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:32.060]  But to watch Howard Stern go from Mr. First Amendment man, if there was a First Amendment
[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:37.100]  man like a superhero, it'd be Howard Stern, according to him. And now I know folks that
[02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:45.260]  XM in the executive branch and all the people in Howard Stern agrees with the establishment that
[02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:50.700]  I shouldn't be allowed on air and that my speech is too dangerous. Now, did Howard Stern have his
[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:57.580]  testicles removed? Or did he never happen to begin with it? Was he a total poser? And Howard,
[02:25:58.460 --> 02:26:02.940]  I don't need your show. It's still popular. You're still an icon. It's a shadow of its former self
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:06.140]  because of the saturation of media. I get it. You don't want to work for three days a week.
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:11.580]  Fine. Most guys would have retired long ago. I'm not here saying all this in case you're asking
[02:26:11.580 --> 02:26:18.140]  on your show. I'm saying I wish you weren't acting like a pathetic little cowardly weasel
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:23.740]  and that you'd be the Howard Stern that was for free speech that people supported.
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:28.620]  That's how you got big, not just your talent, but the fact that people tried to censor you.
[02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:35.020]  You springboarded that to the number one position in many areas of media. You could actually argue
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:42.700]  at one point you were king of all media and now you piss on people that are just trying to tell
[02:26:42.700 --> 02:26:48.860]  the truth. Look, I get it. Oh, we mentioned your info wars.com. You're lucky. And then the guy says
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:54.780]  I have poison in my supplements. That's just added in there. You don't want to produce products.
[02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:58.060]  Well, just say there's poison in it. Branded is poison.
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:05.420]  So let's finish up the Stern piece and I'll play the real child trafficking piece about the
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:09.180]  Clintons with the proof with the Washington Post and Senate reports.
[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:16.940]  You think you're playing a safe turn? You're not. I don't care about coming on your show.
[02:27:16.940 --> 02:27:20.860]  I want you to come out and defense the First Amendment. That would get my respect. Joe Rogan
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:27.980]  did it. You should do it. Maybe you got balls still. Maybe you got them like, you know,
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:33.660]  sounds the lambs tucked up behind you. Are you Howard Stern? Are you Buffalo Bill?
[02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:42.060]  Let's go out to break this clip. Here it is. We also have to ask ourselves, have I been entirely
[02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:45.740]  truthful? I don't know about you, but I've not. I haven't been entirely truthful. I'll give you
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:53.500]  one example. These are my subhuman crab claws. That is my true. Guillermo, anything you want to
[02:27:53.500 --> 02:28:03.900]  address? A horse humanoid hybrid. All right, look. Alex, I have to leave you now. I know
[02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:07.260]  this. We try to give you an opportunity to get your voice out there and I hope you enjoy it.

[02:33:01.900 --> 02:33:31.820]  okay so you know I mean I see it as a compliment that Howard
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:36.700]  Stern talks about me every week and does these big expensive fancy puppet shows
[02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:44.460]  and plugs info wars.com I mean that guy has arguably one of the top radio shows in the
[02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:48.140]  country he's been number one before that's great that's that's always a form of
[02:33:48.940 --> 02:33:51.660]  endearment even if somebody's lying about you they're obsessed with you
[02:33:53.740 --> 02:33:56.380]  but I want to really talk to Howard Stern about something then I'm gonna get to the
[02:33:56.380 --> 02:34:03.740]  child trafficking video of our crew that is so damn important and so documented but I'm gonna
[02:34:03.740 --> 02:34:09.820]  tell you this right now Howard you just had a big cancer scare and I had my genetics tested
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:14.620]  like I said five years ago and they've been in for about a year and my doctor called me and he
[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:19.180]  said you never came into your confrontation you paid thousands for this big top medical scan
[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:24.700]  of your of your DNA we took all this blood for all the blood work and we had blood tests you
[02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:30.860]  this isn't like 23 in me or wherever okay this is like the real deal and I get in there and
[02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:36.220]  they go here's all your genes for this and that and as we thought you're you're northern European
[02:34:36.220 --> 02:34:41.340]  mainly basically they could see the genetics coming down into Germany and into England it's
[02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:49.900]  Viking mainly and they said you've got all your genes but one that's only halfway turned on to
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:55.740]  not absorb vitamin b12 and they and the doctor was explaining medical doctors like four degrees
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:35:03.980]  top clinic in Austin he said you've got to take injectable vitamin b12 and he said I don't care
[02:35:03.980 --> 02:35:08.380]  where you get it we don't make money on it you just need to get it and and I get the prescription
[02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:12.780]  and I forget to do it it's amazing and I've got friends and family that you know I give them a
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:19.100]  shot of it in the fat and they just can't believe the energy they get the next best thing Howard is
[02:35:19.100 --> 02:35:24.140]  this is a plug by the way pure mythical boleman same medical grade under the tongue you can
[02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:28.300]  absorb a lot of it because there's the thing you're gonna say well I'm Jewish well you're also
[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:33.500]  European I got your Catholic and Jewish background but I mean you take Russian
[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:38.940]  Ashkenazi Jews I mean they're like it's European as it gets the exact same traits I looked it up
[02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:43.740]  actually this morning thinking about doing this I already read that do you know that there's only
[02:35:43.740 --> 02:35:48.940]  one group that gets cancer more than northern Europeans from lack of b12 absorption turns out
[02:35:48.940 --> 02:35:54.620]  Jews have the same mutation as northern Europeans some Japanese have it too but almost all northern
[02:35:54.620 --> 02:36:02.140]  Europeans have it where three of my genes are shut off one is halfway shut off some people
[02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:07.900]  get four genes shut off they're dead about 10 years old dude okay so you better get your genetics
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:12.780]  tested and instead of making jokes about my supplements don't get it for me go get it from a
[02:36:12.780 --> 02:36:21.020]  medical doctor it's like Glenn Beck Stern was very very nice you know to have me on the show
[02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:24.460]  someone like Glenn Beck would never do that but how about nice Matt Drudge
[02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:30.700]  Beck said he was going blind he went for a month off went to Utah like six seven years ago remember
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:39.500]  and Beck said he was going blind well all the studies show macular degeneration all of it that
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:44.220]  aspartame and thousands of foods and diet coke and almost all the so-called gums you get there's
[02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:53.020]  supposedly sugar-free or sugar gums even have it it causes degeneration in the cornea in the rods
[02:36:53.020 --> 02:37:00.780]  of the cones the number one thing you can do for your eyes is eat sweet potatoes and carrots and
[02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:08.380]  exercise that flushes blood through yourselves the worst thing you can do is drink aspartame
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:13.260]  so I wrote this big huge article with all the medical studies and everything else and Glenn
[02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:20.540]  Beck attacked me on air and made fun of me aspartame they tried to approve it in the 60s they couldn't
[02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:25.260]  they gave it to Reese's monkeys it killed them but they got it approved in the early 80s Reagan
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.260]  was a good president a lot of a lot of medical attorney go through forced inoculation vaccine
[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:37.020]  immediate liability protection and so Beck made a joke about it but Drudge linked our story
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:42.220]  and was trying to help blend back and Glenn Beck didn't care
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:55.980]  so if you are a northern european or you are a russian jew if you're not taking b12 you're a
[02:37:55.980 --> 02:38:05.420]  crazy person you're a crazy person and yes i'm selling it it's like uh david hog goes i've seen
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:10.780]  jones' show he says there's toxins in the water so we need to filter it and then he sells filters
[02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:15.260]  uh yeah i don't think my audiences are idiots i've got the best filters at the best prices
[02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:20.620]  it's a symbiotic relationship i sell you the best rated filter don't look at the best price
[02:38:20.620 --> 02:38:23.740]  because it funds us and i feel good at night about it and i use it
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:28.620]  people i have so much energy i take b12
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:35.020]  in fact somebody go to my office for refrigerator i'm gonna inject on air right now
[02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:38.860]  will somebody go to their office for refrigerator because i need to do this twice a week i've done
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:44.620]  about a week i'm gonna have plenty of energy oh i bet daria wants to go back there she knows how
[02:38:44.620 --> 02:38:49.180]  good it is anyways and then people go oh god he injected your veins now it goes in your fat
[02:38:49.180 --> 02:38:55.420]  and then you get like 50 something percent absorbed under your tongue 10 percent you eat a pill maybe
[02:38:55.420 --> 02:39:01.100]  one percent that's the thing you don't absorb b12 you could eat a whole bushel of mushrooms
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:07.180]  you could eat a steel a seal steak it's full of b12 you're not getting it you have to get it in your
[02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:13.420]  blood so i'm just gonna take this as an opportunity for everybody this is a win-win find our operation
[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:22.460]  get ultra 12 get ultra 12 ultra 12 is the new secret 12 double strong sign of your contract got a

[02:39:53.020 --> 02:40:00.860]  absorb b12 either b12 is that missing link but if you're northern european it's a death sentence
[02:40:01.900 --> 02:40:08.860]  because you do not absorb it in your body and your body you will die you have to have oxygen
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:14.380]  you have to have water you have to have vitamin c you have to have vitamin b12 you have to have

[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:36.300]  boom right here clean pure energy overriding my genetic mutation as a northern european that my
[02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:41.180]  body does not absorb it except to the bloodstream that's what we're talking about it's not joke stern
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:47.180]  show if you want to live stern do some damn research take medical grade iodine and take b12
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:55.420]  b12 people want no one to on bounce on the walls the best thing i ever did was go to that medical
[02:41:55.420 --> 02:42:00.780]  doctor you got recommended by a good friend of mine he said man you're 40 you're really stressed
[02:42:00.780 --> 02:42:05.180]  you got to go get your blood tested you got to go get your genetics tested you got to go look this
[02:42:05.180 --> 02:42:09.180]  up you got to take care of yourself and i went and i did it and i didn't do half of what the doctor
[02:42:09.180 --> 02:42:12.060]  told me and i'm supposed to go back and get more checkups now it's been five years but
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:17.820]  shoot him in on this this is not what we sell this is methyl b12 that just means altered b12
[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:22.300]  methylcobalamin the highest quality and that's it right there that's what i take in a week since i
[02:42:22.300 --> 02:42:26.780]  took it but i just took some of that on air for your team of your that's what it's all about now
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:31.180]  i'm going to get to the real child kidnapping rings and all the mainstream news admitting it
[02:42:31.180 --> 02:42:35.260]  and then howard stern makes jokes about it but i don't think howard stern is a child molester i don't
[02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:42.140]  think uh the guess he had almost one and and i get it's all a joke but see it belittles the real
[02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:48.860]  stuff that's going on so i'm trying to help you stern you need to take your b12 you need your iodine
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:57.660]  you need your x2 howard stern needs his x2 we've taken thousands of years of known research and
[02:42:57.660 --> 02:43:03.420]  put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that god
[02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:08.780]  gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:15.180]  and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with known compounds from nature that

[02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:32.060]  involved with child trafficking while we are still free to ask questions let's take a close
[02:50:32.060 --> 02:50:40.060]  look at what we know about the clinton's and their associates in 1971 young hillary rottem
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:47.980]  worked at a law firm where she worked on child custody cases in 1973 she did her postgraduate
[02:50:47.980 --> 02:50:54.380]  study at yale on children and medicine her work seemed to be focused on protecting children but in
[02:50:54.380 --> 02:51:01.500]  1975 hillary clinton defended a 41 year old man for the violent gang rape of a 12 year old girl
[02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:07.260]  and they jerked me off my bicycle they put me in a truck and they were hitting me and i was screaming
[02:51:07.260 --> 02:51:13.820]  and crying i went into a coma and i was told at that point by the doctor there was a 99% chance
[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:18.620]  that i could probably never have kids in this affidavits seeking a psychiatric evaluation of
[02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:24.540]  the victim and signed hillary rottem the rookie lawyer painted the victim as emotionally unstable
[02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:30.540]  suggesting she brought false accusations like this before that she fantasized about older men
[02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:36.540]  years later hillary not only bragged about getting her client a lighter sentence but she chuckled
[02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:51.340]  about knowing the man was guilty in 1999 she launched the international center for missing
[02:51:51.340 --> 02:51:57.660]  and exploited children with richard branson and his mother eve with board members tied to the

[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:22.860]  involved and laura sillsby's charges were reduced to arranging irregular travel sillsby then returned

[02:56:41.660 --> 02:56:47.980]  looks very sinister we know there are several ongoing investigations into the clinton foundation
[02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:54.460]  its proxies and their business associates and hopefully the truth will be uncovered and justice

[03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:25.180]  prosper in these soils there is going to be massive migration of tens or hundreds of millions of
[03:02:25.180 --> 03:02:30.780]  people from countries that are literally uninhabitable or underwater the world to see right
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:38.620]  now this is our final chance the scientists will i say you dance on this that we have no more than
[03:02:38.620 --> 03:02:45.420]  12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis the crisis that could at its worst lead
[03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:53.740]  to extinction i think that the part of it that is generational is that millennials and people and
[03:02:53.740 --> 03:03:00.380]  you know gen z and all these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like the world is
[03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:08.780]  going to end in 12 years we're going to address climate change and your biggest issue your your
[03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:14.140]  biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it and yeah i'm going to pay you money how are you
[03:03:14.140 --> 03:03:19.660]  going to pay for it i'm on a private jet bitch so she's saying give me the money so here is the
[03:03:19.660 --> 03:03:25.900]  corrupt weird vampire bat uh mayor of new york at trump tower but trump let him in to do the protest
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:30.380]  and people countered them and of course they wanted them arrested but here's third dimensional
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:36.380]  political activism here it is we even included lost a family friend
[03:03:36.380 --> 03:03:44.860]  and they protested by three days later after the storm they were flooded out they lost everything
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:51.980]  new york city will not survive without a racial a radical action
[03:03:54.380 --> 03:03:58.860]  these storms are going to get far worse if the world doesn't act
[03:03:58.860 --> 03:04:05.020]  no your city will drown as i see your eyes no your city will flood
[03:04:05.020 --> 03:04:12.700]  the city drown you will be on the heat wave we flood what we've seen now you've made my
[03:04:12.700 --> 03:04:20.460]  mayor you'll die i've given up hope america sucks the case at all now i've been fighting back
[03:04:20.460 --> 03:04:28.460]  through activism we can still turn around and create good new york you can still save us
[03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:35.980]  let me run stuff you die you don't let me run because new york city is now leading the world

[03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:14.380]  paul wasis about to take over he's got a big article up on info wars dot com and news wars dot
[03:07:14.380 --> 03:07:21.500]  com the great site he's launched summit dot news i ran women dragged away arrested for protesting
[03:07:21.500 --> 03:07:30.620]  mandatory hijab law now i remember about a year ago linda sorcerer that is a monstrous moray
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:37.580]  eel like creature in way she looks at her politics who gets the hundreds of millions of sorrows
[03:07:37.580 --> 03:07:43.980]  funding literally to lead american women her mother writes the bible of genital mutilation
[03:07:43.980 --> 03:07:49.340]  how to cut little girls genitals author clitoris and just things you didn't even want to know existed
[03:07:50.620 --> 03:07:56.860]  and now she came out last year in this year and criticized women and i ran she said they're
[03:07:56.860 --> 03:08:02.300]  grandstanding when they take their head jibs off and want to go to college or drive a car
[03:08:04.140 --> 03:08:11.180]  she said they're grandstanding in saudi arabia so we've got all this footage of the persian women
[03:08:11.180 --> 03:08:15.180]  who just 40 years ago weren't under islamic rule
[03:08:17.660 --> 03:08:22.780]  and they just want to be free and you go to twitter and you go to facebook and the left
[03:08:22.780 --> 03:08:27.260]  is running around and feminists are like you put that hood back on your head bitch
[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:35.100]  and you're like whoa who are these people the left hates america and the west so much that they see
[03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:42.300]  the shia radicalism sunni radicalism whatever it is they see it as a power group that doesn't like
[03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:50.140]  america and so they're for it and that's a sick group of freaks so let's play this clip
[03:08:51.260 --> 03:08:58.700]  iranian woman right away arrested for protesting mandatory jib law by the monotheistic male run
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:07.500]  government and if you try to talk about it on twitter they will delete your ass just like
[03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:12.620]  all the gay men now dress like women and tell women shut up we're gonna compete in all your
[03:09:12.620 --> 03:09:17.900]  courses i'm not against men but they're about you weird men that like to go in women's bathrooms
[03:09:17.900 --> 03:09:24.700]  dress up like women and get out on a track field run faster than women or get on a basketball court
[03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:29.980]  and meet women or lift board women oh yeah i just beat a woman man you're a tough son of a bitch let
[03:09:29.980 --> 03:09:38.860]  me tell you you're a victim aren't you cupcake what a bunch of sick abusive freaks so here's that
[03:09:38.860 --> 03:09:56.940]  clip tv viewer for liberals i apologize for showing a woman taking a hood off her head
[03:09:56.940 --> 03:10:03.740]  this is anti-feminist the police are doing a good job well sir agrees put it back on full
[03:10:03.740 --> 03:10:09.180]  screen let's get that criminal woman in the vehicle now she'll be taken for torturing
[03:10:12.700 --> 03:10:16.620]  everybody cheers yeah that woman didn't want to wear a hood on her head
[03:10:17.500 --> 03:10:23.580]  other slamming her head in the wall that slamming her head in that vehicle you teach her to do what
[03:10:23.580 --> 03:10:35.420]  she's told them to do
[03:10:39.100 --> 03:10:48.220]  all right so uh yeah you know paul do you want to apologize for that radical evil woman that's
[03:10:48.220 --> 03:10:52.780]  good up to that because the left says that her wearing a jib is good it's a symbol of freedom
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:55.980]  so i'm sorry i just showed a woman rebelling its women's empowerment
[03:10:57.900 --> 03:11:02.140]  well what you don't see in that video but you see a little flash of it here and there is that
[03:11:02.700 --> 03:11:08.460]  the religious police the modesty police which police these streets in countries like iran and
[03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:14.380]  indonesia literally trying to put a carpet over her head because it's so shocking that she would
[03:11:14.380 --> 03:11:20.060]  be uncovered in public literally trying to smother her with a carpet and of course no one around her
[03:11:20.060 --> 03:11:27.980]  helps her whatsoever but this again as he said cnn putting out puff pieces putting out glorification
[03:11:27.980 --> 03:11:34.140]  of the new hijab barbie you know the new nike attire so why do why does the left fetishize
[03:11:34.140 --> 03:11:40.780]  women chained up wearing hoods over their heads because again they can't quantify this contradiction
[03:11:40.780 --> 03:11:47.260]  between the fact that women in the middle east are oppressed subjugated tortured and incarcerated
[03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:53.820]  by this modesty culture which is the hijab and women in the west who muslim women in the west
[03:11:53.820 --> 03:11:58.780]  who claim and grandstand that it's some great liberation and some great choice it isn't a
[03:11:58.780 --> 03:12:05.980]  choice i see three-year-old kids in the park where i live in hijabs why they were in hijabs
[03:12:05.980 --> 03:12:11.340]  because of the male gaze so men don't rape them and then you go and you look at the rape cases
[03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:16.460]  with the grooming gangs alex in the united kingdom and they specifically give that reason that
[03:12:16.460 --> 03:12:21.100]  justification by the way that's chicken or the egg but it's true under islamic culture
[03:12:21.900 --> 03:12:25.020]  that if you're not wearing a hood over your head you're you're to be gang raped
[03:12:26.940 --> 03:12:30.060]  and then you're not even supposed to say that now you're just supposed to like put up with it
[03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:36.220]  no and that's not us saying that that's the groomers the rape gangs in the united kingdom
[03:12:36.220 --> 03:12:42.860]  who were caught and then you had left-wing labor MPs liking tweets from people who said oh well
[03:12:42.860 --> 03:12:47.260]  they were dressed like sluts like they were wearing skirts so they probably deserved it right
[03:12:47.260 --> 03:12:54.700]  literally labor members of parliament liking those tweets and then you look at it historically alex
[03:12:54.700 --> 03:13:02.460]  the very first muslim arab feminist group this was in the 1920s i believe was called the egyptian
[03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:09.500]  feminist union the first act of defiance the first act of protest that they did in favor of women's
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:15.740]  rights in the middle in the middle east was to remove their islamic headscarfs and their hijabs
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:21.580]  so you can go back a hundred years and the first actual real feminists who are actually fighting
[03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:26.300]  for women's rights where it was necessary the first act of defiance that they carried out
[03:13:26.300 --> 03:13:32.700]  was to remove the hijab and now today in the west in 2019 we've got hijab barbie and po we all know
[03:13:32.700 --> 03:13:37.420]  that you've done a great job and i'm gonna have you take over but i want to just say this feminist
[03:13:37.420 --> 03:13:42.620]  aren't for women they want to make women clients of the state islam is a powerful world state probably
[03:13:42.620 --> 03:13:49.420]  the most powerful they just want to wed the power so women feminist leaders are just pimps that wed
[03:13:49.420 --> 03:13:56.460]  women to be enslaved so we just should address them formally as the enslavers of women and stop
[03:13:56.460 --> 03:14:03.820]  letting them act like they're the empowers of women the average ugly you know uh hump back
[03:14:03.820 --> 03:14:09.820]  that feminist is is is is a woman hating vampire and i think women should run to the hills from
[03:14:09.820 --> 03:14:15.820]  these creatures well they have i mean the polls have shown over the past few years that feminism
[03:14:15.820 --> 03:14:20.700]  the word has become a pejorative now it's been folded into the whole intersectionality social
[03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:26.540]  justice movement remember back in the day that the whole curve of youtube commentary was anti
[03:14:26.540 --> 03:14:31.340]  feminist commentary that kind of went by the wayside because we kind of won the argument
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:37.740]  based on how they act you saw the woman at the pro-life demonstration last week feverishly
[03:14:37.740 --> 03:14:42.860]  attacking and punching people because they had pro-life signs and that has come to represent
[03:14:42.860 --> 03:14:48.060]  what a feminist and the word feminist represents in the west so naturally women of any reasonable
[03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:53.420]  mind shy away from that and again they're they're weak people that are actually anti-human program
[03:14:53.420 --> 03:14:59.100]  of the globalist who attack any western pro-freedom person but bow to islam cutting women's genitals
[03:14:59.100 --> 03:15:04.620]  off slave camps can't ride a car hood over your head they just attack the west because they see
[03:15:04.620 --> 03:15:10.460]  it as submitting to them they're looking for dominance they cower in fear to islam because
[03:15:10.460 --> 03:15:16.700]  they're cocked that's their god actually oh completely alex and i mean it's interesting to
[03:15:16.700 --> 03:15:21.500]  understand what people are afraid of they're afraid of guys with pro-life signs peacefully
[03:15:21.500 --> 03:15:26.540]  protesting they're now afraid and i'm going to get into this after the break of the okay hand sign
[03:15:26.540 --> 03:15:32.620]  as we know and now literally 14-year-old girls such girls saying swear words and making edgy
[03:15:32.620 --> 03:15:39.500]  political commentary on youtube they've now gone after smeared and de-platformed a 14-year-old girl
[03:15:39.500 --> 03:15:46.620]  that's where we're at alex all right stay there watching paul joseph lancin of power the jedi

[03:19:21.980 --> 03:19:25.580]  tell us about it well it's really great you know it's like a multi vitamin i take it it tastes
[03:19:25.580 --> 03:19:29.820]  good it doesn't have that nasty aftertaste it actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste and
[03:19:29.820 --> 03:19:33.340]  you know it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day so i really like it well
[03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:37.740]  just so you know we look at whatever the best herbs are they're known to turbo charge women
[03:19:37.740 --> 03:19:44.300]  and then we get the organic ones and put it in it so yeah stamina libido energy these are amazing
[03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:50.140]  things and ultimate female force so i'm glad you plugged it infowarstore.com or triple eight two five
[03:19:50.140 --> 03:19:59.820]  three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:19:59.820 --> 03:20:29.580]  we're live on the alex jones show may 14th 2019 edition and basically what happened was
[03:20:29.580 --> 03:20:35.500]  we handed a hysterical cult that demands total obedience and punishes those who resist with
[03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:43.100]  the platforming public shaming violence and arrest the power to run society things aren't
[03:20:43.100 --> 03:20:47.980]  going to turn out so well are they given that we've done that and they're using the tool of censorship
[03:20:48.700 --> 03:20:54.540]  this is what i tweeted earlier today censorship a weapon of tyrants used to oppress populations
[03:20:54.540 --> 03:21:02.220]  since the dawn of history widely recognized as inherently evil ever since until 2018 when
[03:21:02.220 --> 03:21:07.740]  western leftists and silicon valley started using censorship to their advantage and it
[03:21:07.740 --> 03:21:15.660]  suddenly became virtuous what a coincidence that is and we see another example of that today
[03:21:15.660 --> 03:21:25.420]  where thank god we've been protected from the cuss words and the edgy opinions of a 14 year old
[03:21:25.420 --> 03:21:32.380]  girl on youtube that's right buzzfeed publishes hit piece against tries to de-platform and basically
[03:21:32.380 --> 03:21:40.540]  has at this point 14 year old girl so last night buzzfeed published an article entitled youtube's
[03:21:40.540 --> 03:21:46.380]  newest far right foul mouth red pilling star is a 14 year old girl yes they literally devoted an
[03:21:46.380 --> 03:21:53.580]  entire lengthy hit piece to publicly shaming taking down and demanding censorship of a 14 year
[03:21:53.580 --> 03:22:02.700]  old girl that's how precious they are now this hit piece was written by joe bernstein who proceeded
[03:22:02.700 --> 03:22:10.140]  to lecture us about how quote there are many more people who simply want to preserve the ability
[03:22:10.140 --> 03:22:17.020]  to be bigoted on private platforms that's what joe bernstein and buzzfeed tweeted today there are
[03:22:17.020 --> 03:22:22.220]  many more people who simply want to preserve the ability to be bigoted on private platforms
[03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:29.500]  this is the same buzzfeed journalist who in a tweet a few years ago said this kill a straight
[03:22:29.500 --> 03:22:38.140]  white man on your way to work tomorrow oh so it's okay for him to be bigoted on private platforms
[03:22:38.140 --> 03:22:44.940]  but god forbid a 14 year old girl would make an edgy youtube video but again it goes back to the
[03:22:44.940 --> 03:22:53.980]  old saying it's okay when we do it joe bernstein is also the guy who tried to de-platform pewdiepie
[03:22:53.980 --> 03:22:59.100]  you'll remember i think it was last year came out with a big hit piece because pewdiepie was
[03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:05.900]  involved in a online video game session with a few other people who he didn't know who could be
[03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:11.180]  anywhere in the world one of them as he killed another character in the game in which pewdiepie
[03:23:11.180 --> 03:23:16.940]  was playing said the words i think it was heil hitler so then joe bernstein wrote a piece
[03:23:17.500 --> 03:23:23.900]  completely lying and blaming pewdiepie for this heil hitler quote that was made by a completely
[03:23:23.900 --> 03:23:29.740]  different person on a completely different part of the world during an online video game session
[03:23:29.740 --> 03:23:36.540]  again somebody that pewdiepie did not know so this is a guy who's lied about people in the past
[03:23:36.540 --> 03:23:41.900]  to try to get them de-platformed who has made bigoted statements of course he'll call it a joke
[03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:48.620]  it's okay for the leftist to joke about killing white people anyone tells an edgy joke on the right
[03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:56.620]  oh they must mean it they must be serious so what's happened in the 12 or so hours since this hit piece
[03:23:56.620 --> 03:24:04.140]  went up is that once again massive silicon valley giants who make their corn who make their revenue
[03:24:04.140 --> 03:24:08.940]  because they're going bust and having to lay off dozens of employees left right and center
[03:24:08.940 --> 03:24:14.540]  who make their money from rage bait and from attacking people who are more talented and more
[03:24:14.540 --> 03:24:19.980]  popular than them in the 12 hours since oh and that's the other point that was made several times
[03:24:19.980 --> 03:24:28.300]  this 14 year old girl who's telling edgy jokes and making edgy insults and you know edgy rhetoric
[03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:35.340]  about islam and social justice warriors that's bad that's a moral crisis that's a moral panic
[03:24:35.340 --> 03:24:43.100]  the 11 year old drag queen kid who the mainstream media platforms and worships every available
[03:24:43.100 --> 03:24:50.460]  opportunity that's fine that's wholesome so we've got that disconnect and in the 12 hours
[03:24:50.460 --> 03:24:56.220]  since this hit piece went up against a 14 year old girl with the full might of buzzfeed behind
[03:24:56.220 --> 03:25:03.500]  attacking her and smearing her she's had her ability to upload on youtube suspended for at least a week
[03:25:04.540 --> 03:25:08.140]  which again shows that these big corporate media silicon valley giants
[03:25:08.140 --> 03:25:13.740]  are in bed with the mainstream media they ask people to be banned to be censored it happens
[03:25:13.740 --> 03:25:21.340]  within hours every single time and now the actual video ran which caused the controversy in the
[03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:25.740]  first place again you can call for killing straight white men apparently that's what
[03:25:25.740 --> 03:25:30.940]  joe bernstein did joked about it that's completely fine his twitter account is still active and
[03:25:30.940 --> 03:25:37.740]  verified but if you make a 20 minute edgy youtube video that is gone within 12 hours and if you click
[03:25:37.740 --> 03:25:44.300]  on that video in the article it says this video has been removed for violating youtube's terms of
[03:25:44.300 --> 03:25:50.940]  service the terms of service that don't apply to anyone on the left when they call for outright
[03:25:50.940 --> 03:25:56.700]  violence as we've seen with facebook as well with literal Hamas pages even as the even as
[03:25:56.700 --> 03:26:02.300]  they're raining down missiles on Israeli civilians still being allowed on facebook yours truly is
[03:26:02.300 --> 03:26:10.620]  banned alex jones is banned by leonopolis is banned law relumer is banned so we have this article up
[03:26:10.620 --> 03:26:16.140]  and again people make the point that he called for killing straight white men on their way to work
[03:26:16.140 --> 03:26:22.620]  we have the disconnect between desmond is amazing he gets platformed he gets worshiped by the mainstream
[03:26:22.620 --> 03:26:30.300]  media a 14 year old who makes an edgy youtube video that has to come down in a hurry think how
[03:26:30.300 --> 03:26:37.180]  petrified they are of the opinions of a 14-year-old girl that they have to devote an entire hit piece
[03:26:37.180 --> 03:26:43.660]  they have to be in communication with youtube to get this dangerous thought criminal removed from
[03:26:43.660 --> 03:26:49.420]  society which is probably what will happen dave rubin responded to it he said there are adult
[03:26:49.420 --> 03:26:54.300]  journalists who hunt down kids on youtube to report the wrong thing which in this case is
[03:26:54.300 --> 03:26:59.740]  biting social commentary and funnier than anything on network tv but again the right can't make edgy
[03:26:59.740 --> 03:27:07.020]  jokes only the left can it's okay when we do it that's their mantra ali alexander tweeted youtube
[03:27:07.020 --> 03:27:13.020]  is deplatforming a 14-year-old girl for exploring her own viewpoints not cool buzzfeed attacks
[03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:19.340]  children now tweeted nick munrow i'm sorry that the vultures have come to attack you mark dice said
[03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:23.980]  buzzfeed is trying to get this 14-year-old girl banned from youtube because her humor
[03:27:23.980 --> 03:27:31.340]  hurts their feelings faith goldie said this kids cross-dressing sex dancing for adults
[03:27:31.340 --> 03:27:38.380]  while having dollar bills waved at them stunning and brave kids using adult words words while making
[03:27:38.380 --> 03:27:46.300]  political commentary moral crisis these buzzfeed types are henchmen of the evil one and remember
[03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:52.860]  this is the same outlet who a few weeks ago before i was banned completely lied about me by claiming
[03:27:52.860 --> 03:27:58.700]  that i had made up a video about muslims celebrating the notradam fire and that it wasn't about the
[03:27:58.700 --> 03:28:05.660]  notradam fire even as in the video the notradam cathedral was burning in the background even
[03:28:05.660 --> 03:28:12.540]  as people were all over al-jazeera arabic france 24 arabic in the comments and i put it all this
[03:28:12.540 --> 03:28:18.860]  in my video celebrating the notradam fire they completely lied they had to semi-backtrack it
[03:28:18.860 --> 03:28:25.180]  was pathetic beyond belief and now those same people have now been tasked with de-platforming
[03:28:25.180 --> 03:28:31.580]  a 14-year-old girl because we're apparently children who can't hear mean words from a teenager
[03:28:31.580 --> 03:28:36.940]  and we have to be protected from that so now her video has gone the good news is that she's got
[03:28:36.940 --> 03:28:43.980]  about 25 30 000 new subscribers since this buzzfeed attack happened how long the youtube channel
[03:28:43.980 --> 03:28:49.020]  remains up at this point remains to be seen but we know the history of that we'll be back with

[03:33:30.300 --> 03:33:37.500]  opinions because we're children apparently number one south who you see there in the youtube video
[03:33:37.500 --> 03:33:43.500]  go and subscribe to her she's gonna be on the alex jones show tomorrow all being well two other
[03:33:43.500 --> 03:33:49.420]  points about buzzfeed and tim paul talked about this in his video on the subject today you have
[03:33:49.420 --> 03:33:54.940]  this news or this organization called news guard which is the new author of what's credible on the
[03:33:54.940 --> 03:34:02.540]  internet in terms of news of course far left bias guaranteed they have two providers by which your
[03:34:02.540 --> 03:34:08.460]  website and bear in mind this is a company that is trying to get their browser extension which
[03:34:08.460 --> 03:34:14.780]  denotes what sites are credible and what sites are fake news installed on all new computers by
[03:34:14.780 --> 03:34:21.820]  microsoft by windows that's their ultimate goal to get this installed to downrank websites that
[03:34:21.820 --> 03:34:26.540]  they determined to be fake news they have two providers by which your website qualifies as
[03:34:26.540 --> 03:34:32.060]  being legit genuine news source and of course when you look at buzzfeed on news guard it's all
[03:34:32.060 --> 03:34:36.780]  green tick green tick green tick it's the most credible news source imaginable they don't just
[03:34:36.780 --> 03:34:44.460]  make up fake pgate stories which rip apart america for two years running now this news guard organization
[03:34:45.420 --> 03:34:51.500]  which emailed me last week and asked me about 20 questions about summit news because obviously
[03:34:51.500 --> 03:34:56.780]  they're gonna downrank it and try and bury it in google search results didn't respond to the email
[03:34:56.780 --> 03:35:01.820]  don't care you're not credible not news organization or any kind of organization so i don't give a damn
[03:35:01.820 --> 03:35:09.420]  but there two providers for what qualifies as a legit news source is number one you can't have
[03:35:10.140 --> 03:35:16.220]  fake or misleading advertising on your website if you want to qualify as a credible news source
[03:35:17.180 --> 03:35:24.940]  now buzzfeed reviews sells its own brand of cookware that's how they make money people laugh
[03:35:24.940 --> 03:35:31.740]  at info wars for selling nutritional products god forbid buzzfeed makes money by selling cookware
[03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:39.340]  and they write articles reviewing their own cookware and saying how great it is that is misleading
[03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:45.340]  that breaks one of the terms of news gods provides those for being a credible news website number two
[03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:53.020]  they also say that news articles should not be presented as opinion which is what i do on summit
[03:35:53.020 --> 03:35:58.060]  news i'm not a journalist i'm a commentator every single thing you see on there is my opinion
[03:35:58.060 --> 03:36:04.460]  not trying to hide it that's not the case for buzzfeed buzzfeed presents itself in these articles
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:10.220]  like the one they used to try and smear and de-platform this 14 year old girl as a straight
[03:36:10.220 --> 03:36:16.300]  news article not as an opinion piece despite the fact that it's written by joe bernstein a guy who
[03:36:16.300 --> 03:36:21.180]  literally lied about PewDiePie to try and get him de-platformed a guy who literally tweeted
[03:36:21.180 --> 03:36:26.780]  that people should kill straight white men his words not mine so they present this article on
[03:36:26.780 --> 03:36:35.100]  buzzfeed as a straight news article but in the sub headline of the article he says quote so far as
[03:36:35.100 --> 03:36:39.340]  nearly a million followers on the giant video platform okay that's a fact but then he says
[03:36:39.340 --> 03:36:46.140]  the sites executives only have themselves to blame okay that's his opinion that's not a straight
[03:36:46.140 --> 03:36:51.100]  news article so that violates one of the key provisos of news gods
[03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:59.260]  provisos on what legitimate on what qualifies as a legitimate news source so in the very article in
[03:36:59.260 --> 03:37:05.900]  the very sub headline he gives his opinion that's not a straight news article that doesn't qualify
[03:37:05.900 --> 03:37:12.220]  under news gods own terms as a credible news source but again because it's a left-wing
[03:37:12.220 --> 03:37:18.380]  mainstream media website their own rules don't apply to them absolutely playground and that's
[03:37:18.380 --> 03:37:26.140]  why news god itself has no credibility whatsoever now unlike buzzfeed we don't sell crappy cookware
[03:37:26.140 --> 03:37:32.060]  that we review ourselves and tell you how great it is we have independent third party reviews on

[03:38:50.700 --> 03:38:56.460]  now another story upon summit.news have you heard about who the latest white supremacist is yes it's
[03:38:56.460 --> 03:39:04.940]  gay liberal atheist television presenter Stephen Fry clown world claims another victim headline
[03:39:04.940 --> 03:39:12.140]  gay liberal atheist Stephen Fry labeled a white supremacist for using the okay hand sign so basically
[03:39:12.140 --> 03:39:18.220]  Stephen Fry who has a history of basically left-wing activism he's the furthest from far right you
[03:39:18.220 --> 03:39:23.580]  could ever imagine he's a gay liberal atheist British television presenter is being labeled a
[03:39:23.580 --> 03:39:28.380]  white supremacist because he did the okay hand sign now who is labeling him a white supremacist
[03:39:28.380 --> 03:39:34.700]  off throwing that label towards his name a few deranged hysterical but her idiots on twitter
[03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:40.700]  which wouldn't normally be a news story but again as I said before the only way the likes of
[03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:47.260]  buzzfeed the likes of metro and all these other mainstream leftist news websites can generate
[03:39:47.260 --> 03:39:53.660]  traffic and can generate clicks and ad revenue is by creating completely
[03:39:53.660 --> 03:39:59.740]  non-stories and turning them into stories so Stephen Fry flashed up the okay hand sign
[03:40:00.380 --> 03:40:06.940]  to promote mental health awareness week his tweet said are you a okay and then a bunch of
[03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:13.180]  media outlets took hold of it because they found a few twitter respondents to his tweet
[03:40:13.980 --> 03:40:19.500]  who claimed that he was boosting alt right racists didn't you didn't have you down as part of the
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:26.060]  alt right wrote one of these hysterical morons another one wrote this Stephen and friends you
[03:40:26.060 --> 03:40:31.180]  might want to be super careful using this symbol if you don't want to be confused with white supremacist
[03:40:31.180 --> 03:40:36.860]  creeps and that was basically it so they took like a handful of comments from idiots that responded
[03:40:36.860 --> 03:40:42.460]  to his tweet turned into a news story and now suddenly there's this big debate about whether
[03:40:42.460 --> 03:40:48.460]  Stephen Fry is a white supremacist just like that cubs fan right there who flashed the deadly
[03:40:48.460 --> 03:40:53.820]  dangerous symbol which of course is part of the circle game has nothing whatsoever to do with
[03:40:53.820 --> 03:40:59.100]  white supremacism banned him from the stadium and then NBC News and a bunch of other outlets
[03:40:59.100 --> 03:41:05.260]  had to blur out the okay hand sign because they said it was offensive and it could radicalize
[03:41:05.260 --> 03:41:13.180]  people truly truly clown world behavior so fry was forced to respond to this controversy
[03:41:13.180 --> 03:41:19.500]  which was created by the media out of like three tweets by tweeting i really will not allow the
[03:41:19.500 --> 03:41:24.220]  simple okay gesture to belong to the moronic dog whistling catfishing fog honing frog marching
[03:41:24.220 --> 03:41:30.460]  pig sticking bleep waving few who attend to appropriate it for their own fatuous fantasies
[03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:35.980]  so he was forced to respond after all these news outlets start reporting it like it was
[03:41:35.980 --> 03:41:42.460]  a serious story this is a guy who is a lifelong member of the labor party the left wing party in
[03:41:42.460 --> 03:41:49.500]  the united kingdom lifelong environmentalist committed to lgbt activism this is not a right
[03:41:49.500 --> 03:41:56.540]  wing guy so as i wrote in the article either steven fry is a closet white supremacist who's
[03:41:56.540 --> 03:42:02.700]  been hiding his bigotry for 61 years behind a veil of left-wing political beliefs and liberal
[03:42:02.700 --> 03:42:09.260]  activism or the media and the left is run by a cult that needs to constantly fan the flames
[03:42:09.260 --> 03:42:15.900]  of hysteria to convince everyone that neo-nazis are taking over society in order to obtain power
[03:42:15.900 --> 03:42:23.020]  and generate revenue you be the judge and again as we know this okay hand gesture just like most
[03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:28.060]  of these other contrived moral panics was literally created as a result of a four-chan troll
[03:42:30.140 --> 03:42:34.460]  they trolled and tricked the media into believing that it was a secret symbol of white supremacy
[03:42:34.460 --> 03:42:39.020]  so once again society is caught between a bunch of nihilistic autistic four-chan
[03:42:39.020 --> 03:42:45.500]  spurglock trolls and a hysterical mainstream media that takes them seriously and then legitimizes
[03:42:45.500 --> 03:42:52.940]  their autism for rage bait clicks welcome to clown world this is the Alex Jones show info wars.com
[03:42:52.940 --> 03:42:57.500]  you know the worst part about getting old i'm still strong at 45 is that i won't be there for
[03:42:57.500 --> 03:43:01.980]  my children someday that's why i need to make them strong now now i can be there for my children

[03:47:23.740 --> 03:47:29.980]  you're live in the final segment of the alex joneshow another absolutely shocking headline
[03:47:29.980 --> 03:47:37.500]  of info wars.com and summit.news is this two years after islamic terror attack add for islamic
[03:47:37.500 --> 03:47:44.540]  group with alleged terror ties appear appears on side of manchester arena this is actually
[03:47:44.540 --> 03:47:51.740]  the most shocking news story of the day it should be at least so of course back in may 2017 a radical
[03:47:51.740 --> 03:47:58.060]  islamist called salman abadi detonated a homemade shrapnel bombers people mainly children
[03:47:58.060 --> 03:48:07.340]  believing in ariana grande concert of the manchester arena 23 killed 139 people injured some of them
[03:48:07.340 --> 03:48:15.100]  maimed for life more than half of the victims were children as we reported at the time it emerged
[03:48:15.100 --> 03:48:22.460]  that abadi was a refugee rescued from libya by the british royal navy before he took a flight to
[03:48:22.460 --> 03:48:28.700]  the uk three years before the attack and his father actually fought with lifg but which was
[03:48:28.700 --> 03:48:35.900]  basically al-qaeda in helping to overthrow momar gadafi which of course led to the rise of isis
[03:48:35.900 --> 03:48:44.460]  and the migrant crisis so this suicide bomber who maimed or killed 150 plus people was brought
[03:48:44.460 --> 03:48:54.700]  into the uk as a result of a refugee policy may 22nd 2017 walks out of the ariana grande concert
[03:48:54.700 --> 03:49:01.420]  detonates a suicide bomb 23 people dead 139 people injured absolutely horrific he of course what was
[03:49:01.420 --> 03:49:09.420]  radicalized at the local mosque and now two years to the day an ad for an islamic group with alleged
[03:49:09.420 --> 03:49:15.740]  ties to terrorism has appeared on the side of the same building in which in which that islamic
[03:49:15.740 --> 03:49:23.020]  terror attack took place this is actually happening the ad and you can see it in this article
[03:49:23.660 --> 03:49:29.020]  reads to save a life is as if you've saved all of mankind which of course is quoting from the
[03:49:29.020 --> 03:49:35.020]  quran in the one of the next passages it says kill the infidels and it was paid for by islamic
[03:49:35.020 --> 03:49:41.180]  relief who is islamic relief well it's an organization which is banned in israel for allegedly
[03:49:41.180 --> 03:49:47.820]  funding per mass a group which as we know also carries out suicide bombings a group which is
[03:49:47.820 --> 03:49:54.060]  listed as a terrorist organization by the european union and by the united states of america but it's
[03:49:54.060 --> 03:50:01.580]  not just israel the government of bangladesh which is a muslim country put restrictions on this group
[03:50:01.580 --> 03:50:07.180]  alleging that they were using funds raised from charitable donations to promote radicalism
[03:50:07.180 --> 03:50:13.580]  across the world and it's not just bangladesh the united arab emirates government also blacklisted
[03:50:13.580 --> 03:50:22.540]  the group as an alleged terrorist front in 2016 and it's not just governments in 2016 hsbc cut
[03:50:22.540 --> 03:50:27.180]  ties which for them is a big deal to cut ties because they're basically money launderers
[03:50:27.180 --> 03:50:33.260]  in a different sense hsbc cut ties with the group the group that's responsible for this
[03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:38.140]  billboard on the side of the manchester arena after concerns that cash meant for humanitarian
[03:50:38.140 --> 03:50:44.940]  purposes was being sent to terrorist groups abroad so to summarize an islamic group with
[03:50:44.940 --> 03:50:49.740]  alleged ties to terrorism ties that numerous governments in a major bank have alleged
[03:50:49.740 --> 03:50:57.660]  has been blacklisted by numerous countries is now advertising its islamic relief foundation
[03:50:57.660 --> 03:51:03.740]  with a quote from the quran on the side of a building that was bombed with hundreds of people
[03:51:03.740 --> 03:51:10.860]  dead or injured by an islamic terrorist just two years ago that is actually happening in manchester
[03:51:10.860 --> 03:51:16.380]  england for me that is the most shocking story of the day absolutely ridiculous
[03:51:16.380 --> 03:51:25.420]  us meanwhile in germany video german leftists applaud death threats against afd so this afd
[03:51:25.420 --> 03:51:30.380]  chairman frank magnets was taking part in a political debate on german television
[03:51:31.180 --> 03:51:38.860]  they asked him why the party which did very well in the 2017 german elections was performing poorly
[03:51:38.860 --> 03:51:45.340]  in a certain area of germany in bremen and magnets responded by saying that it was politically
[03:51:45.340 --> 03:51:51.740]  difficult for the afd in germany because they can't hold events in the region because of all the
[03:51:51.740 --> 03:51:59.500]  death threats and he cited specifically he said quote the reason is very simple because the owner
[03:51:59.500 --> 03:52:05.580]  of this event where this building where the afd rally was supposedly about to take place
[03:52:05.580 --> 03:52:12.620]  no longer wanted to rent it out to us because he received death threats what was the response to
[03:52:12.620 --> 03:52:18.460]  these death threats from the audience during that television debate they all broke out in
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:24.860]  spontaneous applause not all of them but numerous people in the crowd broke out in whoops and
[03:52:24.860 --> 03:52:31.660]  hollers of delight and rounds of applause including one of them as he saw there who's literally the
[03:52:31.660 --> 03:52:39.660]  guy wearing the red sweatshirt which literally said always be kind he's wearing a sweatshirt that
[03:52:39.660 --> 03:52:45.500]  says always be kind while applauding death threats against a political party because he disagrees
[03:52:45.500 --> 03:52:54.300]  with their opinions so much for the tolerant left bbc reports tommy robinson faces new
[03:52:54.300 --> 03:52:59.180]  contempt case though basically he's going to be up for trial once again for basically
[03:52:59.180 --> 03:53:04.700]  filming some rape gang pedos outside a court which had no impact on their trial whatsoever
[03:53:04.700 --> 03:53:09.100]  they were convicted oh but it was because he maybe hurt their feelings that was actually
[03:53:09.100 --> 03:53:16.220]  the excuse they used during the trial today of course the dozens of news cameras that rushed in
[03:53:16.860 --> 03:53:20.780]  after tommy robinson when he entered the court building they weren't hurting feelings no it's
[03:53:20.780 --> 03:53:26.300]  different rules for them it's okay when they do it and actually this next proceeding this next
[03:53:26.300 --> 03:53:33.020]  legal proceeding will take place on july 4th which is when the members of the european parliament
[03:53:33.020 --> 03:53:38.060]  who win the elections which are coming up next week enter the european parliament so they chose
[03:53:38.060 --> 03:53:44.220]  to hold it on the same day when tommy robinson would be entering the european parliament if
[03:53:44.220 --> 03:53:51.420]  he wins his me pc which according to the panicked news reports is i wouldn't say it was overwhelmingly
[03:53:51.420 --> 03:53:56.700]  likely but it's definitely a possibility i think he needs to win about eight or nine percent of
[03:53:56.700 --> 03:54:02.460]  the vote or at least ukip does in that region not ukip because he's an independent but him
[03:54:02.460 --> 03:54:08.380]  personally needs to win at least eight or nine percent of the vote to get into the european parliament
[03:54:08.380 --> 03:54:14.460]  so he's actually got a chance of winning so now they've set the next court case date on july 4th
[03:54:14.460 --> 03:54:19.420]  when he would actually be entering the european parliament just a coincidence meanwhile irish
[03:54:19.420 --> 03:54:25.340]  government health body tells women to flush their aborted babies down the toilet of course island
[03:54:25.340 --> 03:54:30.140]  had a referendum last year which said it was now legal in island to get an abortion during the first
[03:54:30.140 --> 03:54:36.140]  12 weeks of pregnancy and later in cases where the pregnant woman's life or health is a risk now
[03:54:37.180 --> 03:54:41.660]  island's government's official health body has a section on its website that advises women to
[03:54:41.660 --> 03:54:48.220]  flush their aborted babies down the toilet this is in a segment called pregnancy remains it says
[03:54:48.220 --> 03:54:53.020]  quote if you have an abortion before nine weeks of pregnancy you can decide how to dispose of
[03:54:53.020 --> 03:54:58.060]  the remains they can be flushed down the toilet or wrapped in tissue and disposed of as you wish
[03:54:58.060 --> 03:55:03.020]  so as i point out in this article you know i used to say that we live in a society which
[03:55:03.020 --> 03:55:08.860]  treats its young like medic like a medical waste product and i was wrong because it's worse than
[03:55:08.860 --> 03:55:16.700]  that we actually treat them like literal feces meanwhile in iran alex touched upon this earlier
[03:55:17.340 --> 03:55:23.100]  woman dragged away arrested for protesting mandatory hijab law uh in the video there it shows the
[03:55:23.100 --> 03:55:28.460]  the modesty police who patrol the streets looking for women whose hijabs have slipped because it's
[03:55:28.460 --> 03:55:33.900]  a big feminist icon you know grabbing this woman at one point they attempt to throw up some kind
[03:55:33.900 --> 03:55:39.980]  of carpet over her drag her away she's screaming they bundle her into a car and she is whipped away
[03:55:39.980 --> 03:55:44.940]  no doubt to be imprisoned for years on end other women who've protested against this law in iran
[03:55:44.940 --> 03:55:49.100]  have been imprisoned for two or three years god knows what happens to them once they're in prison
[03:55:49.100 --> 03:55:54.700]  um we've got another video in that article which shows not just the modesty police but
[03:55:55.340 --> 03:56:02.220]  men in iran slapping women demanding that they put their hijabs back on meanwhile in the west
[03:56:02.220 --> 03:56:09.100]  cnn says that it's the new feminist symbol they celebrate the hijab barbie of course when you
[03:56:09.100 --> 03:56:14.460]  look at the videos out of uh out of the middle eastern areas like syria and iraq where women
[03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:21.180]  are liberated from isis occupation and oppression what is the first thing they do they discard the
[03:56:21.180 --> 03:56:27.660]  hijab because that is an oppressive patriarchal control mechanism that is used to subjugate
[03:56:27.660 --> 03:56:33.740]  women across the middle east but somehow for some reason in the west it's celebrated as this great
[03:56:33.740 --> 03:56:40.700]  liberator of women so we've got that article up there too meanwhile italy declares war on
[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:46.780]  NGOs will find boats for rescuing immigrants of course we had the media frothing over uh
[03:56:46.780 --> 03:56:51.020]  prime minister victor orban of hungary's visit to the white house yesterday saying that he was a
[03:56:51.020 --> 03:56:58.540]  hateful bigger is it any coincidence i ask that the european leaders who have acted most aggressively
[03:56:58.540 --> 03:57:04.940]  in protecting their country against overwhelming mass immigration are the most popular leaders
[03:57:04.940 --> 03:57:12.220]  on the continent in matthew salvini and victor orban with salvini now threatening to find NGO
[03:57:12.220 --> 03:57:17.340]  rescue boats which as we've documented in the past are working hand in glove with criminal
[03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:22.700]  people smugglers to get these migrants across under salvini migrant deaths have halved because
[03:57:22.700 --> 03:57:28.460]  there's no incentive for the migrants to come over in the first place and just by coincidence salvini
[03:57:28.460 --> 03:57:34.300]  just like orban in hungary is next to orban the most popular political leader in europe while
[03:57:34.300 --> 03:57:38.940]  the mainstream media in the last text now that's going to wrap it up for the show war and with
