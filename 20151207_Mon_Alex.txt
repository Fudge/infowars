[00:00.000 --> 00:12.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.160 --> 00:20.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.920 --> 00:29.680]  we've seen NBC, MSNBC, CNN all imply that Christians kind of deserve what they got
[00:29.680 --> 00:34.520]  maybe the terrorists saw a Christmas tree well now we've got reporters openly
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.080]  coming out in major newspapers implying that Christians were terrorists and
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.000]  basically deserved it that's coming up but first the Attorney General says her
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.900]  number one fear is that she might have to arrest you if you don't fall out and
[00:46.900 --> 00:52.160]  worship the Islamic invasion here's the special report Attorney General Loretta
[00:52.160 --> 00:57.080]  Lynch said Thursday at the Muslim Advocates 10th anniversary dinner she
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.200]  will take aggressive action against the incredibly disturbing rise of anti
[01:02.200 --> 01:08.040]  Muslim rhetoric actions predicated on violent talk are not America they're
[01:08.040 --> 01:12.760]  not who we are they're not what we do and they will be prosecuted Lynch did not
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.720]  clarify what actions predicated on violent talk means and did not draw a
[01:17.720 --> 01:23.440]  line between constitutionally protected free speech and violence she also did
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.440]  not pinpoint individuals or groups she believes participate in violent talk
[01:28.440 --> 01:33.760]  Judge Andrew P. Napolitano notes the willingness alone to use violence is not
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.640]  criminal it is only the actual use of violence that is thus it is the
[01:39.640 --> 01:45.240]  manifestation of hatred as lawless violence that may be prosecuted but the
[01:45.240 --> 01:51.440]  manifestation of hatred as a unifying idea is protected and may not be
[01:51.440 --> 01:56.240]  prosecuted the First Amendment absolutely bars the government from
[01:56.240 --> 02:02.160]  interference from a person's thoughts or associations prior to any violent
[02:02.160 --> 02:07.160]  activity Lynch's recent grandstanding before a Muslim group reveals the
[02:07.160 --> 02:11.760]  Justice Department and the Obama administration are promoting the so-called
[02:11.760 --> 02:16.880]  social justice agenda at the expense of the Constitution and the First
[02:16.880 --> 02:21.520]  Amendment it also underscores the collectivist idea that government has
[02:21.520 --> 02:27.280]  the authority enforced by its monopoly of coercion and violence to protect the
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.600]  rights of preferred groups at the expense of the rights of the individual
[02:32.600 --> 02:37.720]  meanwhile the female shooter in San Bernardino posted her allegiance to
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.640]  ISIS on Facebook while Obama constantly inappropriately takes jabs at the
[02:43.640 --> 02:48.120]  Christian faiths remember that during the crusades in the inquisition people
[02:48.120 --> 02:52.880]  committed terrible deeds in the name of price less than loving expressions by
[02:52.880 --> 02:59.080]  Christians I get concerned that's right let's criticize Christianity on Easter
[02:59.080 --> 03:03.480]  crap that's topic for another day why are we supposed to be politically correct
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.880]  while our traditions rights country and very lives are increasingly threatened
[03:09.880 --> 03:12.760]  on a daily basis
[03:13.760 --> 03:21.400]  to solid swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United
[03:21.400 --> 03:28.640]  States against all enemies foreign and domestic
[03:28.640 --> 03:35.400]  that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same but I take this
[03:35.400 --> 03:41.840]  obligation free without any mental reservation without any mental
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.760]  reservation or purpose of evasion that I will well and faithfully discharge
[03:47.760 --> 03:52.800]  that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office
[03:52.800 --> 04:00.080]  which I'm about to enter attorney general Loretta Lynch you do remember
[04:00.080 --> 04:05.200]  swearing in on Frederick Douglass's Christian Bible at your request you do
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.360]  know was Frederick Douglass who famously said I would unite with anybody to do
[04:11.360 --> 04:16.440]  right and with nobody to do wrong the protection of religious freedom is the
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.600]  cornerstone of American society and of course not all Muslims are hell bent on
[04:21.600 --> 04:27.680]  jihad but it turns out a percentage of them are and those psychopaths are in
[04:27.680 --> 04:32.760]  the United States and mixed in with the refugees streaming in as I speak and
[04:32.760 --> 04:48.200]  they have no clue what American civil rights are nor do they care no president

[08:26.360 --> 08:43.480]  welcome ladies and gentlemen to December 7th 2015 a date that will live in
[08:43.480 --> 08:50.760]  infamy when the president his attorney general and foreign controllers openly
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.280]  declared a war on the second amendment and promised to use executive orders to
[08:55.280 --> 09:00.960]  strip the United States of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and
[09:00.960 --> 09:06.920]  Magna Carta itself which of course is due process we're gonna be playing the
[09:06.920 --> 09:11.760]  clip coming up when Obama says who can you argue who could say it's not
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.960]  reasonable to not let somebody own a gun or buy a gun if they're on a no-fly
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.440]  list well who could have a no-fly list in a country where there's no judge no
[09:22.440 --> 09:26.480]  jury no indictment don't know how you got on the list over 2 million people on
[09:26.480 --> 09:30.200]  the list 70 plus members of Homeland Security on the list a whole bunch of
[09:30.200 --> 09:35.000]  members of Congress on the list you can't find out how you got on it can't
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.640]  find out how you get off of it no one says who runs it just some shadowy
[09:39.640 --> 09:50.360]  black hole beyond the Ministry of Truth in 1984 Obama says it's insane and this
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.240]  is how they turn reality upside down and say 2 plus 2 equals a billion or you
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.680]  didn't build your business or Obamacare is gonna be free and then it's gonna cut
[09:59.680 --> 10:10.160]  your prices and then it's gonna keep your doctor lies lies lies lies it is so
[10:10.840 --> 10:18.520]  incredibly flagrant to abuse the Constitution like this and they do it so
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.240]  calm like who could disagree with the government showing up at your front door
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.080]  and grabbing your five-year-old and leading them outside to a wood shipper
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.080]  and throwing them in it I mean who could disagree with that who could
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.200]  disagree with pouring gasoline all of yourself and letting yourself on fire I
[10:38.200 --> 10:43.240]  mean this is basically akin to what they're saying I mean who could disagree
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.160]  with taking you know terrorists who are on watch list and not letting them have
[10:48.160 --> 10:51.920]  guns but that's not what's happening it's not terrorists who are convicted or
[10:51.920 --> 10:57.120]  even suspected it's not foreigners either this Malik woman with her fake name and
[10:57.120 --> 11:04.040]  the rest of it from Saudi Arabia this Jihad Jane the leader of the attack that
[11:04.040 --> 11:13.000]  killed 14 people not counting these two be 16 total this leader of the operation
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.560]  joined ISIS pledged allegiance to ISIS and got into the US with a fake passport
[11:19.560 --> 11:25.360]  fake name fake address it turns out it's all fake and the State Department says
[11:25.360 --> 11:31.200]  they're very sure that they did the right thing and that the vetting process
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.440]  was followed here let me give you the exact quote we also have the clip State
[11:37.440 --> 11:44.160]  Department satisfied with visa process that allowed terrorists in the US oh the
[11:44.160 --> 11:48.640]  IRS is back in Congress again they tried this last year they're they're trying
[11:48.640 --> 11:53.640]  to pass a bill right now and they say it may pass where if they say you're under
[11:53.640 --> 11:57.720]  investigation no judge no jury no indictment just somebody in the shadowy
[11:57.720 --> 12:02.600]  IRS that's on record persecuting Americans for political activities since
[12:02.600 --> 12:11.440]  1913 under Richard Nixon under Barack Obama you name it just absolute evil they
[12:11.440 --> 12:17.600]  don't want you to be able to fly out of the United States and will basically
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.680]  block your passport at the border and now they're talking about doing it to go
[12:21.680 --> 12:28.880]  from state to state even and the headline basically says will the IRS even
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.520]  kick you out of your car the IRS will be the enforcer of Obamacare it will be
[12:34.520 --> 12:39.160]  the enforcer of coming after our guns it's the real shadow criminal
[12:39.160 --> 12:43.400]  organization that works for the private Federal Reserve there's the headline
[12:43.400 --> 12:48.400]  today Ron Paul's written the article will the IRS take your passport it's up
[12:48.400 --> 12:56.360]  on info wars.com Congress is giving the IRS the new power because a decline in
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.880]  gas tax receipts is bankrupt the Federal Highway Trust fund that's their
[12:59.880 --> 13:08.360]  bizarre spin and you think asset for which your seizure is bad now this is
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.240]  just seizure right to travel because some shadowy group said so see this is
[13:12.240 --> 13:21.240]  what they call grade A 200 proof complete absolute bona fide certified
[13:21.240 --> 13:30.960]  high-bred blue ribbon champion tyranny everything they're doing from A to Z in
[13:30.960 --> 13:47.240]  a 360 is 100 percent classical 800 pound gorilla oppression taking away your
[13:47.240 --> 13:51.720]  travel taking away due process surveilling everything you do federalizing
[13:51.720 --> 13:56.720]  centralizing police saying we'll just put you on list no judge no jury no
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.760]  nothing no charges no claims nobody knows boom you can't have your guns this
[14:02.760 --> 14:09.040]  president four years ago signed on New Year's Eve yeah it was four years ago
[14:09.040 --> 14:18.760]  2011 the NDAA the National Defense Authorization Act that says citizens can
[14:18.760 --> 14:22.600]  be disappeared oh but they're not gonna disappear people from Saudi Arabia who
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.240]  pledge allegiance to ISIS or al-Qaeda that'd be bad enough because it could
[14:26.240 --> 14:29.280]  end up being used against us one day no no you give them a trial and then you
[14:29.280 --> 14:35.080]  fry their ass and a lot comes out in a trial corrupt governments don't want
[14:35.080 --> 14:38.480]  those trials because it'll come out who they're really protected by who they're
[14:38.480 --> 14:46.240]  really working for their higher-ups in Saudi Arabia and others like Turkey but
[14:46.240 --> 14:50.560]  now they say oh no it's for the Tea Party and the veterans and the gun owners
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.240]  every SWAT team commander they talk to on the news they go why do you have
[14:54.240 --> 14:57.400]  giant armored vehicles and they go oh it's for returning veterans and gun
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.280]  owners and conservatives in the Tea Party a war is coming with them and I
[15:01.280 --> 15:05.480]  guess when you try to take the guns and round people up yeah I mean folks who
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.240]  tried to be restrained I mean I guess you will get resistance you'll get to go
[15:09.240 --> 15:12.400]  out and play army with all the vets in your neighborhood that will go real
[15:12.400 --> 15:17.640]  well cops that's meant to wipe your ass out in a civil war idiots how do you
[15:17.640 --> 15:21.000]  think the globalist plan to launch this operation and take down the country by
[15:21.000 --> 15:29.320]  getting us to kill each other don't be a moron this is so crystal-clear it's
[15:29.320 --> 15:34.480]  ridiculous it's ridiculous you're been up on a mountain top with blue skies I
[15:34.480 --> 15:37.960]  was on a big bend a few months ago and it was clear skies up a front came
[15:37.960 --> 15:41.480]  through big storm came through hurricane came through the first two days it was
[15:41.480 --> 15:46.160]  crystal-clear you could see from top those mountains over a hundred miles away
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.600]  I was looking at towns 70 miles away and then pass them another mountains it's
[15:52.600 --> 15:58.960]  the song I can see from miles and miles and miles and you think we can't we see
[15:58.960 --> 16:03.680]  the whole stinking enemy design and I'm gonna tell you this if we have the
[16:03.680 --> 16:07.000]  globalist design to take down this country and we can't get the word out of
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.240]  the police the military and the Congress and the general public then we
[16:10.240 --> 16:13.680]  deserve to be slaves because we have their entire program we have them caught
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.040]  red-handed shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and getting
[16:17.040 --> 16:21.080]  caught with the memos that it was a plan because lower-level ATF are like this
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.840]  is criminal we're getting people killed what are you doing shipping thousands of
[16:23.840 --> 16:29.280]  guns in don't worry it's just it's to blame the Second Amendment and they're
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.160]  like well I was hired because I'm a liberal anti-gunner but really that's a
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.120]  felony I'm not gonna be involved in this one thing to be a cockamamie
[16:38.120 --> 16:42.080]  socialist at the ATF it's nothing isn't it to be part of a false flag really
[16:42.080 --> 16:45.320]  want to be part of that we're gonna put your name on that because let me tell

[16:50.120 --> 16:54.880]  quit and it's gonna be decision time for people all over this country and all
[16:54.880 --> 16:57.360]  over this world you know what else happened this weekend before I get into
[16:57.360 --> 17:04.800]  the incredible news I have seen CNN NBC MSNBC all go with my Christmas tree well
[17:04.800 --> 17:08.840]  one of them was a talkative Christian may have triggered huh implying it was the
[17:08.840 --> 17:16.280]  victim's fault they've actually had a major columnist Linda Stasi no pun
[17:16.280 --> 17:24.760]  intended sensationally blamed the victims for being killed and basically
[17:24.760 --> 17:34.120]  calls them radical racist terrorist actually calls them racist and doesn't
[17:34.120 --> 17:38.040]  count the Christian and others there's a messianic juice that's a double no no a
[17:38.040 --> 17:41.960]  Christian Jew had to be executed immediately and it was the same and he
[17:41.960 --> 17:44.800]  told him I'm coming to kill you and no one do anything because the guy was an
[17:44.800 --> 17:49.000]  Arab and then it's so political correct there's there's there's no group more
[17:49.000 --> 17:56.240]  off-limits than radical Jihad Arabs and so came to work with a list of who they
[17:56.240 --> 18:02.560]  wanted to kill and they did and they showed everybody who the boss was there
[18:02.560 --> 18:06.240]  it is Stasi and I read that headline this morning I thought Stasi the East
[18:06.240 --> 18:10.240]  Termin secret police that Facebook's hired see I just I just said that and
[18:10.240 --> 18:14.400]  that's actually true and I can't even believe I just said it see that's how
[18:14.400 --> 18:19.440]  upside down these freaks are look at this Stasi that's the that's the columnist
[18:19.440 --> 18:25.560]  let's put it back on screen San Bernardino killers were radical ISIS loving
[18:25.560 --> 18:31.240]  monsters but one of their victims was just as bigoted bigoted because he was a
[18:31.240 --> 18:36.760]  messianic Jew and was worried about ISIS and was reportedly ministering and
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.800]  trying to get this guy to become a Christian you know at the lunchroom
[18:40.800 --> 18:44.760]  and that's bigoted you see when Donald Trump went before a bunch of Jewish
[18:44.760 --> 18:48.440]  business people and said I'm a great negotiator like you I'm really good at
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.080]  getting stuff done and working together they said anti-semitic no that's not
[18:52.080 --> 18:57.680]  anti-semitic if I was in northern Italy at some city that is famous for making
[18:57.680 --> 19:01.000]  incredible pottery and I was a person that made pottery as well and I was
[19:01.000 --> 19:06.040]  speaking to their group of artisans I would say you are incredible artisans and
[19:06.040 --> 19:13.600]  so am I it's solidarity no if you point out Kenyans statistically genetically
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.240]  are the best long-distance runners in the world it's just the fact that they
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.360]  dominate almost every global long-distance sport that's not racist to
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.800]  point out Kenyans have superior genetics when it comes to that it's not
[19:25.800 --> 19:32.320]  racist it's a fact but see they sit there and they
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.480]  take these basic known facts and then they turn it into evil if you point
[19:38.480 --> 19:42.080]  something out like that like saying to Germans gee you sure brewed some good
[19:42.080 --> 19:45.160]  beer oh my gosh that's racist oh it's not it's like saying you go eat Mexican
[19:45.160 --> 19:48.480]  food man you made some really good enchiladas those Mexicans over there
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.000]  not a really make good Mexican food it's not racist this is the mental illness
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.320]  folks and these people are sick sick sick freaks and that's how much they hate
[19:57.320 --> 20:05.160]  Christians and Jews earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages
[20:05.160 --> 20:09.240]  or war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be
[20:09.240 --> 20:13.280]  better prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then
[20:13.280 --> 20:17.640]  we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking
[20:17.640 --> 20:21.960]  about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will
[20:21.960 --> 20:25.920]  I keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but
[20:25.920 --> 20:29.680]  the problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.720]  you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[20:33.720 --> 20:37.960]  smoke like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel
[20:37.960 --> 20:43.080]  the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers

[24:12.440 --> 24:17.240]  minutes I'm gonna really go over the huge news how big a deal the president's
[24:17.240 --> 24:22.040]  speech is what it signifies what it means judicially in this country it means
[24:22.040 --> 24:27.640]  the rollout of extra judicial disappearance of people disappearance of
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.600]  your money not letting you travel confiscating your guns because some
[24:32.600 --> 24:38.320]  magical group said so the FBI came out six months ago because the FBI doesn't
[24:38.320 --> 24:42.280]  want to be part of this and I'm not lionizing the FBI it's just compared to
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.520]  the White House they're actually good guys the more I look at it the FBI came
[24:47.520 --> 24:52.520]  out and said we just want everybody to know in Congress we've been told to
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.560]  prepare the same algorithm used on veterans by the VA where even electronic
[24:58.560 --> 25:06.120]  transfer of funds basically declares you extra judicially that you are basically
[25:06.120 --> 25:10.360]  unable to take care of yourself that you're declared incompetent and they use
[25:10.360 --> 25:16.280]  the term this was in mainstream news extra judicially and we're being told
[25:16.280 --> 25:22.680]  at the next system to not apply if you're a felon or have a restraining order we
[25:22.680 --> 25:30.200]  are being told that that's one of the criteria and it's a VA algorithm which
[25:30.200 --> 25:33.120]  just means whatever they want it to be when they take the veterans guns outside
[25:33.120 --> 25:38.800]  of law do you understand that's the next shoot a drop they've been beta testing
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.400]  in upstate New York areas of California this for about four years they're doing
[25:43.400 --> 25:50.560]  it outside of law and I'm getting chills right now folks this is pure Soviet or
[25:50.560 --> 25:56.400]  Nazi level crap I mean this is what went on in those countries so you need to
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.240]  understand folks that they are coming they are not playing games and gun
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.200]  sales of course are spiking and exploding right now as they should but we
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.640]  start the next segment I got a hit military news first Turkey invaded Iraq
[26:11.640 --> 26:18.760]  yesterday and NATO began bombing Syrian military bases Joe Biggs first reported
[26:18.760 --> 26:22.720]  that out of Syrian news it's confirmed today our media plays that same game
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.480]  going well it was an accident they're also threatening to blow up Russian
[26:27.480 --> 26:35.320]  ships the president came out and gave an address yesterday in Turkey and the
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.640]  Russians are responding by loading their missile launchers and artillery when
[26:39.640 --> 26:43.400]  they go through the straits now and airgun says they're not supposed to do
[26:43.400 --> 26:51.880]  that and they say we're gonna do it so it is on folks it is on it is on the
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.360]  globalists aren't moving on all fronts against everybody right now we're gonna
[26:55.360 --> 27:02.800]  break that down but this is escalating super quick super fast and people go
[27:02.800 --> 27:05.880]  they're gonna try to confiscate veterans guns that'll cause a revolt oh
[27:05.880 --> 27:12.720]  that's the point of rubbing our noses in all this and saying they'll arrest
[27:12.720 --> 27:18.040]  people if they think this the speeches extreme towards Muslims they are
[27:18.040 --> 27:22.480]  pushing us and I want to say something do not hurt any Muslims most Muslims are
[27:22.480 --> 27:28.800]  not violent or bad people a beavers do process do not hurt anybody don't play
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.760]  into this do not be part of it they're probably gonna fall flag or something
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.560]  but I'm telling you this is the season of radical change as they promised so I'm
[27:40.560 --> 27:45.960]  telling yourself I'm telling you folks buckle in buckle up because I told you
[27:45.960 --> 27:50.840]  that you know what's gonna hit the oscillating device and it's here it's
[27:50.840 --> 27:54.400]  now hitting the oscillating device it's just gonna get crazier from here on out

[29:53.400 --> 29:56.840]  GCN radio network
[30:00.200 --> 30:03.560]  did you know that when you're serving jury duty you have complete authority
[30:03.560 --> 30:07.080]  over the law in the power to stop the government that's right as a juror you
[30:07.080 --> 30:10.200]  can not only judge the defendant but also the law he's being charged with as
[30:10.200 --> 30:12.680]  well that's a little known secret prosecutors don't
[30:12.680 --> 30:15.720]  want you to know for example let's say a man is charged with marijuana
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.080]  possession and you don't agree with that law well as a juror you can decline
[30:19.080 --> 30:21.880]  charging the man because you don't believe the law is justified
[30:21.880 --> 30:25.080]  judges and prosecutors have misled juries and to believe in that they should
[30:25.080 --> 30:28.520]  only examine the facts of the case and not the law but the juror can actually
[30:28.520 --> 30:31.720]  stop the enforcement of unconstitutional laws in two ways as a
[30:31.720 --> 30:34.360]  grand jury you may refuse the government's request to pursue criminal
[30:34.360 --> 30:37.720]  charges against the accused and as a trial juror you can acquit the
[30:37.720 --> 30:40.440]  defendant who is charged with breaking an unconstitutional law
[30:40.440 --> 30:44.200]  either way by using jury nullification the juror has the power to say no
[30:44.200 --> 30:47.720]  thus having an immediate indirect effect on our government you can find out more
[30:47.720 --> 30:53.320]  from the fully informed jury association which can be found at www.fija.org

[34:31.480 --> 34:37.320]  other states they had announcements in texas of all places but also vermont
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.440]  a whole bunch of states saying if you say obama is a muslim
[34:42.440 --> 34:48.360]  if you say obama is not going to cut taxes you will be arrested
[34:48.360 --> 34:51.960]  by the way we think i'm joking go to youtube and type in obama truth squads
[34:51.960 --> 34:56.200]  and you will see newscast from missouri texas vermont
[34:56.200 --> 35:01.240]  illinois and other states all the same script
[35:01.240 --> 35:05.400]  district attorneys with police on tv saying we're gonna arrest you
[35:05.400 --> 35:09.560]  if you talk about about barack obama now that's who these people are
[35:09.560 --> 35:14.040]  flaming totalitarians dangerous now obviously
[35:14.040 --> 35:18.600]  most police most district attorneys are not complete out of control thugs
[35:18.600 --> 35:22.760]  but let me tell you they're trying to main line it
[35:22.760 --> 35:28.120]  there it is obama truth squad responds to outrage citizens
[35:28.120 --> 35:31.960]  you can actually go watch the youth brigades
[35:31.960 --> 35:38.200]  prepare to spy on you well they had big plans for obama and most of it's failed
[35:38.200 --> 35:42.440]  but still what he's gotten through has been nightmarish
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.920]  so you can go back to 2012 2009 2008 you can see the truth squads on the news
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.560]  oh i forgot one too boston massachusetts going
[35:53.960 --> 35:58.120]  if you claim the president wants to raise taxes or that obama care is it free
[35:58.120 --> 36:01.560]  you are a liar and that's fraud and i will arrest you
[36:01.560 --> 36:08.360]  because as the local district attorney i investigate fraudulent claims
[36:08.360 --> 36:13.320]  oh what does that mean you mean in advertising and so now my speech is
[36:13.320 --> 36:19.000]  advertising this is the garbage they engage in
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.760]  attorney general loretta lynch monday sounds like a country music singer
[36:22.760 --> 36:26.200]  appeared to recalibrate remarks she made last week that suggests the just
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.440]  department can investigate speech deemed hostile towards muslims
[36:30.440 --> 36:33.400]  of course we prosecute deeds and not words she said at a press conference
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.680]  monday to announce an unrelated civil rights investigation of the chicago
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.400]  police department then they go on to expand on that no
[36:41.400 --> 36:44.200]  they are telling people we will arrest you for your speech
[36:44.200 --> 36:49.800]  that's what this is all about and they think of christian speech
[36:49.800 --> 36:56.440]  as the worst thing in the universe and we have a new clip from elissa harris
[36:56.440 --> 36:59.640]  perry the one that gets up there and says your kids along with the state
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.040]  where she holds up malik who was trained at a pakistani
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.640]  islamo fascist school we now know of course
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.560]  fine about the saudi arabians they're building 200 of these are in the u.s
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.760]  200 even the fbi and even british intelligence has come out
[37:16.760 --> 37:20.040]  and even the germans came out who've been putting up with all this
[37:20.040 --> 37:25.080]  last week and told saudi arabia stop it but see they never do that on record
[37:25.080 --> 37:28.120]  because americans are getting informed now about who's behind this
[37:28.120 --> 37:34.280]  why this is happening but leftist journalist this is an info wars dot
[37:34.280 --> 37:37.480]  com headline you can go to the new york daily news and read it though i mean
[37:37.480 --> 37:41.160]  that she really did it victim of san bernadino
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.640]  shooting deserved it because he was conservative
[37:45.640 --> 37:48.600]  how do you pronounce that fellow's name phallocinos
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.960]  was also a hate filled bigot close quote i didn't say that
[37:53.960 --> 37:59.400]  so christians a messianic jew they were multiple christians were hunted down
[37:59.400 --> 38:02.600]  and killed because they were christians
[38:02.600 --> 38:08.200]  they were two hate filled bigoted municipal employees interacting in one
[38:08.200 --> 38:11.480]  department she wrote now 13 innocent people are dead the unspeakable
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.560]  carnage stasi that's her name
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.000]  phrasing is revealing she refuses to include
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.320]  the christian among the innocent and instead places him among the guilty
[38:23.320 --> 38:29.160]  alongside furuk and malik indicating wednesday's shooting was his fault
[38:29.160 --> 38:35.720]  then we have links to the news saying christmas tree might have triggered it
[38:37.400 --> 38:41.240]  don't you just love it how sick these people are here's
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.440]  melissa paris harry
[38:44.920 --> 38:48.920]  remember they talked about paul rine being a hard worker
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.520]  to basically open the borders up and set up a north american union let anybody
[38:52.520 --> 38:56.680]  in he basically might as well be the leader of la raza or matcha or something
[38:56.680 --> 39:01.000]  which it's it's all room of big corporations to begin with
[39:04.360 --> 39:10.200]  she stopped the pundit and said oh the only hard workers are black people
[39:10.200 --> 39:16.600]  from slavery see with that trump card all time all dimensions all history
[39:16.600 --> 39:21.560]  that matter of your white polish person or japanese or black from south africa
[39:21.560 --> 39:26.600]  you can be looked at and told your work never matters black slaves
[39:26.600 --> 39:30.680]  we're gonna play that clip in a moment in case you think i'm making it up because
[39:30.680 --> 39:34.680]  i know it sounds crazy this is where all information comes from that
[39:34.680 --> 39:37.880]  perspective to just checkmate everybody else
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.680]  you don't know reading writing or arithmetic you don't know social skills
[39:40.680 --> 39:44.440]  you don't know how to get a job you just learn how to niny and obsess over
[39:44.440 --> 39:49.560]  brown paper bags you see or a car drove by with a rebel flag so you urinate all
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.240]  of yourself in fear or there's gonna be a halloween party at the college and so
[39:53.240 --> 40:00.520]  you screamed your professor and then the dean of yale says

[40:19.160 --> 40:21.880]  of the rulers of the disabled psychologically
[40:21.880 --> 40:25.960]  one of the new semantical princesses over the throngs
[40:25.960 --> 40:30.520]  a university professor a former top but university official
[40:30.520 --> 40:36.360]  she's running on the whole msnbc crowd of mental midgets
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.440]  the same program they run on these desperate scared in-depth

[41:26.760 --> 41:31.560]  debt bubble and the college scam so here's melissa harris perry pimping
[41:31.560 --> 41:34.840]  everybody then i gotta get into the latest news
[41:34.840 --> 41:38.040]  but here she is going look at this they're showing the face of jihad as a
[41:38.040 --> 41:42.200]  woman it's so horrible well that is the face of it lady
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.960]  they have a report coming up rob dude's putting together where we show obama
[41:45.960 --> 41:50.280]  over and over again to me the next hour saying
[41:50.280 --> 41:53.240]  now your republicans are scared of women and
[41:53.240 --> 41:56.520]  children and widows and then yeah they're blowing everybody up shooting
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.440]  everybody and running around murdering people
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.280]  and the point is in the aggregate it's still a small
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.760]  effect and i don't think it is even a large minority of muslims
[42:06.760 --> 42:09.560]  the issue is you're gonna take our rights and our guns
[42:09.560 --> 42:14.200]  leave the border open and surveil what citizens do it's all a fraud
[42:14.200 --> 42:17.080]  that's what we're saying
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.480]  that's what's going on and you bring in millions of people from jihad zones
[42:23.480 --> 42:26.920]  who invaded syria to take over a wealthy prosperous nation
[42:26.920 --> 42:30.280]  let me tell you these sunnis came in folks and took people's houses their
[42:30.280 --> 42:33.640]  swimming pools their businesses their thousand-year-old farms
[42:33.640 --> 42:37.000]  christians and non-radical muslims and blew their heads off
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.760]  they even came to other sunnis that had money and robbed them
[42:40.760 --> 42:43.960]  and now the russians have kicked them out of most areas so they're going to
[42:43.960 --> 42:47.400]  libya and they're going to other areas and getting out
[42:47.400 --> 42:53.000]  into europe they're going through turkey and they're coming here
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.840]  and then the guy's complaining about christians and jews at work
[42:56.840 --> 43:01.720]  he's from america she goes listen we're gonna lead an attack and kill all of them
[43:01.720 --> 43:05.800]  and melissa harris perry can't allow that because the only villain is white
[43:05.800 --> 43:09.800]  people in her ford foundation program and by
[43:09.800 --> 43:12.840]  the way she doesn't hate white people she's rich and lives with a bunch of
[43:12.840 --> 43:16.680]  white people she's half white she's just there to
[43:16.680 --> 43:20.440]  game everybody and keep them on the plantation she is a slave master
[43:20.440 --> 43:25.640]  a modern psychological colonist of people's brains to screw them up
[43:25.640 --> 43:30.440]  let's go to this operative literally a schooled and psych warfare
[43:30.440 --> 43:34.360]  100 percent i'm not just saying that for rhetoric folks she's trained
[43:34.360 --> 43:39.000]  okay how to jack people's brains here she is and then all of a sudden we find
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.880]  out they're muslim bam gun violence is out of the question
[43:41.880 --> 43:46.040]  we start talking about terrorism and i'm extremely disturbed i mean i looked at
[43:46.040 --> 43:50.120]  the new york times cover today here you have a whole op-ed on gun control
[43:50.120 --> 43:54.520]  great right next to it from the apartment of things that i have in my
[43:54.520 --> 43:57.480]  house yes like these are things that all muslims
[43:57.480 --> 44:01.800]  have in their house there's nothing about that that tells you a story about
[44:01.800 --> 44:04.600]  what terrors have looked like so you're telling me that well my friends who are
[44:04.600 --> 44:09.160]  not muslim come to my home and see see a quran or see frames on the wall with
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.920]  a scripture from my from my religion that is that supposed to tell you something
[44:12.920 --> 44:15.800]  i mean it's absolutely outrageous we would never do that to anyone and we
[44:15.800 --> 44:18.920]  didn't do that to dear we didn't do that to roof
[44:18.920 --> 44:22.040]  i'm i'm tired of the double standards of how we treat muslims they are the
[44:22.040 --> 44:26.040]  perfect that image and then also right next to it an image of
[44:26.040 --> 44:30.360]  the shooting suspect there in in his job and that idea that like okay this is
[44:30.360 --> 44:35.480]  what terrorism looks like i for me that that is a difference
[44:35.480 --> 44:39.560]  and it is a material and meaningful difference all right why why doesn't
[44:39.560 --> 44:42.840]  melissa harris perry wear a a headdress if you went to one of those countries
[44:42.840 --> 44:46.120]  you'd have to and our government's backing the groups
[44:46.120 --> 44:49.640]  that go to these countries and make people wear
[44:49.640 --> 44:54.040]  these headdresses so i got a woman with a headdress on lobbying that no one
[44:54.040 --> 44:59.160]  blamed white people for roof they blamed everybody they took down the
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.680]  confederate battle flag in three state houses
[45:02.680 --> 45:06.920]  everyone apologized for basically being white did the black people apologize
[45:06.920 --> 45:11.240]  when the crazy black guy went and shot people uh you know a few weeks later
[45:11.240 --> 45:14.040]  because they were white no and black people shouldn't apologize you didn't
[45:14.040 --> 45:18.360]  do that that individual did that oh no no one
[45:18.360 --> 45:22.040]  showed his home no one showed where roof lived no one
[45:22.040 --> 45:24.840]  of course they did
[45:27.480 --> 45:31.160]  so this is how these people operate meanwhile we've got obama and his
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.320]  presidential address last night saying they're going to end
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.800]  judicial due process 1215 magna carta battle of running me
[45:39.800 --> 45:42.840]  forget constitution both rights it's all based on that
[45:42.840 --> 45:48.440]  running me 1215 why who could disagree if somebody
[45:48.440 --> 45:53.320]  is on a terrorist no fly list that you could buy a gun
[45:53.320 --> 45:56.520]  no one could disagree with extra judicial no fly list that
[45:56.520 --> 46:00.360]  millions of innocent americans are on no judge no jury no background can't get
[46:00.360 --> 46:04.280]  off it don't know how you got on it this is the ndaa
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.760]  this is all of it just disappearing who they want the irs not letting you fly
[46:08.760 --> 46:13.240]  or travel or drive a car or get a driver's license they're talking about
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.480]  under federalization of the national id card the real id act
[46:17.480 --> 46:21.880]  now the feds used to say no highway funds if your speed limits over 55
[46:21.880 --> 46:27.000]  now it's oh you we're gonna selectively say who can have a driver's license now
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.200]  if the irs doesn't like you ron paul's written article about that today
[46:32.200 --> 46:35.400]  you like extra judicial the irs that persecutes
[46:35.400 --> 46:39.160]  anybody right of mount satung you want to live in a tyranny
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.840]  folks it doesn't get more brazen more arrogant more naked more complete
[46:44.840 --> 46:51.560]  more in your face giant red flags explosions and balloons going up
[46:51.560 --> 46:58.280]  they're not going to let you fly they're not going to let you drive and by the way
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.320]  you know how i know all this i don't just need to read ron paul's op-ed about it
[47:01.320 --> 47:04.200]  that just gives you pieces of it i'm not blaming him he just gives you pieces of
[47:04.200 --> 47:09.160]  it i watched a two-hour c-span deal in 2002 when they were giving cabinet level
[47:09.160 --> 47:12.440]  authority to the department of homeland security
[47:12.440 --> 47:17.160]  that bill clinton had proposed six years earlier
[47:17.160 --> 47:20.680]  and i watched them lay out the whole plan you won't fly you won't drive
[47:20.680 --> 47:23.320]  you won't have a job unless the tsa authorizes it
[47:23.320 --> 47:26.520]  and i told you the tsa would be on the streets they'd be at train stations
[47:26.520 --> 47:29.960]  they'd be at checkpoints and now they're rolling out everywhere
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.240]  i'm talking to folks in the middle of nowhere and small towns in texas
[47:33.240 --> 47:36.840]  that drive up to an armored vehicle with tsa guys and by the way this isn't
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.760]  the folks at the airport to get you used to it that was just clown training
[47:40.760 --> 47:46.200]  these are guys with m4s with the transportation department
[47:46.200 --> 47:51.880]  and let me tell you they're trained to go after patriots and veterans
[47:52.680 --> 47:56.280]  do you understand this isn't a game people
[47:56.280 --> 48:01.960]  99 of what i tell you is already on record
[48:01.960 --> 48:05.080]  i didn't have to dream up they do this and then it started happening
[48:05.080 --> 48:08.680]  they told us do you understand they're coming
[48:08.680 --> 48:13.000]  for christians and conservatives and veterans and they go on the news
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.840]  and say that jews and christians deserve to have their heads blown off
[48:16.840 --> 48:20.680]  in california in major newspapers and the editors
[48:20.680 --> 48:23.880]  let them print that i'm not saying censor them
[48:23.880 --> 48:27.160]  i'm saying does that show the mindset behind the scenes folks
[48:27.160 --> 48:31.640]  i'm telling you the average liberal is a fascist death cult operator who wants
[48:31.640 --> 48:35.640]  to kill libertarians christians and conservatives and quite frankly
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.240]  i used to be kind of in between on israel because israel does some bad stuff
[48:39.240 --> 48:42.760]  and i'm like pure israel worshipers but let me tell you something
[48:42.760 --> 48:47.880]  the jew hating the israel hating all of it is is is just over the top as well
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.320]  i mean it is just crazy
[48:52.280 --> 48:55.320]  and i'm just listening who is slated for destruction and they just put the
[48:55.320 --> 48:58.040]  police in there as well because they want to wreck the local governments and
[48:58.040 --> 49:02.840]  have the feds come in let's go to obama with extra
[49:02.840 --> 49:06.680]  judicially taking your guns here it is there's several steps that congress
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.000]  should take right away to begin with congress should act to make
[49:11.000 --> 49:16.120]  sure no one on a no fly list is able to buy a gun
[49:16.120 --> 49:20.120]  what could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a
[49:20.120 --> 49:24.760]  semi-automatic weapon back that up this is a back that up
[49:24.760 --> 49:27.720]  what could be the constitutional argument against it from a constitutional
[49:27.720 --> 49:33.880]  lawyer from harvard who was the head of the harvard law review
[49:33.880 --> 49:41.000]  what a sick joke he sits there and prays on his idiot followers
[49:42.120 --> 49:44.600]  think about it
[49:45.080 --> 49:48.920]  and then they put radical muslims up on tv to lecture
[49:48.920 --> 49:52.360]  hardcore super feminists that basically say all men are rapist and evil
[49:52.360 --> 49:59.000]  and then she sits there with a woman who's wearing a hood on her head
[49:59.640 --> 50:03.160]  but she's gonna lecture us about how our kids don't belong to us do you realize
[50:03.160 --> 50:08.040]  what degenerate cultural oxymorons these people are
[50:08.040 --> 50:11.160]  these are power grabbers these are people who just want to lecture us all
[50:11.160 --> 50:14.680]  day and tell us how to live and and and guilt us well i'm not
[50:14.680 --> 50:22.120]  guilty you fascist evil slug obama
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.280]  your family out of kenya funding and literally running jihad operations
[50:28.280 --> 50:32.680]  all over the middle east of africa i'll give obama this he's bold
[50:32.680 --> 50:36.920]  i could never have imagined the islamic radical sleeper cell becoming president
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.000]  i mean i can't believe the cia did this i can't believe our governments did this
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.560]  but after all that's how much they hate america
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.400]  and christians and guns and george washington baby
[50:47.400 --> 50:51.160]  well you know what i'm betting on george washington and john wane all the way
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.280]  and all you scum to go to hell i'm never backing down we're gonna beat your ass
[50:56.280 --> 51:00.360]  you just get that through your stinkin trader's heads
[51:00.360 --> 51:03.400]  excuse me i apologize and we have a lot of christian affiliates i am a christian
[51:03.400 --> 51:08.760]  but i'm not a fake either and i i'm angry i've had enough of these people
[51:08.760 --> 51:12.920]  they're a bunch of christian murdering scum that run giant death factories
[51:12.920 --> 51:16.760]  keeping babies alive and selling their body parts what more do you need to
[51:16.760 --> 51:20.440]  know about these people i go out and face these these scum
[51:20.440 --> 51:23.800]  they literally crawl out from under rocks they have
[51:23.800 --> 51:27.640]  green-looking skin of their black or white doesn't matter and they run around
[51:27.640 --> 51:30.520]  screaming we love satan we want to eat babies
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.520]  i have them on video at the texas statehouse just women randomly going
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.120]  hail satan and and just praising satan
[51:38.120 --> 51:41.960]  when a democrat group went up there i mean folks this is literally like a
[51:41.960 --> 51:46.280]  demonic invasion i'm telling you that's what it is
[51:47.480 --> 51:51.080]  and these demons will definitely side with any other radical group they can
[51:51.080 --> 51:55.320]  to bring this country down i'm sorry i'm sorry just just just
[51:55.320 --> 51:58.280]  go back to the president with a straight face going who could be against the
[51:58.280 --> 52:03.880]  terrorist suspect if someone's a terrorist suspect you need to arrest them
[52:03.880 --> 52:07.720]  you oh but you don't ever actually do that the tsa hasn't stopped one terrorist
[52:07.720 --> 52:11.800]  they're not meant to they're there to train you for domestic checkpoints
[52:11.800 --> 52:16.360]  and domestic travel restrictions like you have in science fiction movies
[52:16.360 --> 52:21.960]  like the running man or 1984 or what really happened in communist china
[52:21.960 --> 52:26.520]  russia nazi germany and every other hell pit
[52:26.520 --> 52:30.760]  they are bringing us into bondage with huge chains
[52:30.760 --> 52:35.720]  forged for us and our children smiling at us
[52:36.360 --> 52:40.520]  this is the take down of america you're beginning to see the beginning of
[52:40.520 --> 52:43.960]  with every police department trained and ready for war with the veterans and the
[52:43.960 --> 52:47.240]  patriots but here's the goodness you think it
[52:47.240 --> 52:50.920]  woke the police departments up much when we warned them beforehand they laughed
[52:50.920 --> 52:54.120]  at us then they actually got the training where the founding fathers are
[52:54.120 --> 52:58.440]  badmouth where guns are badmouth where families are badmouth and now the final
[52:58.440 --> 53:00.600]  straw george soros people come into every major
[53:00.600 --> 53:04.200]  city with the southern property law center and adl and are running the police
[53:04.200 --> 53:06.520]  training and are openly saying you're gonna have
[53:06.520 --> 53:09.800]  community organizers in here running things and here's your new captain and
[53:09.800 --> 53:13.720]  they bring in known malice and others right out of the universities with their
[53:13.720 --> 53:18.840]  new law enforcement degrees i mean you talk about dangerous and
[53:18.840 --> 53:22.920]  sick and they're putting the military full all these people
[53:22.920 --> 53:26.520]  and again they're it's not a communist conspiracy at the top but they use
[53:26.520 --> 53:32.200]  university communist as their operatives
[53:32.200 --> 53:35.160]  then once they've got the police department they can start harassing
[53:35.160 --> 53:39.080]  the city council and others in the town and intimidate everyone into politically
[53:39.080 --> 53:42.600]  doing what they want and now you're under a literal
[53:42.600 --> 53:47.560]  stasi control grid that they've almost gotten place
[53:47.560 --> 53:51.400]  now you understand why the peril is so great why i'm so freaked out because
[53:51.400 --> 53:55.240]  everything the worst analysis we had it's worse than that
[53:55.240 --> 53:59.800]  they are going for broke this is it god help us you know they're going to blow
[53:59.800 --> 54:02.680]  stuff up and blame it on us that's their next big card to play
[54:02.680 --> 54:06.280]  there's going to be more jihad attacks they'll probably run a false flag on
[54:06.280 --> 54:12.680]  some jihad center and blame patriots this is a time bomb
[54:12.680 --> 54:16.120]  excuse me go back to obama please this is obama coming after the guns
[54:16.120 --> 54:19.480]  and traditionally here it is there are several steps that congress should take
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.160]  right away to begin with congress should act to
[54:23.160 --> 54:28.440]  make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun
[54:28.440 --> 54:32.520]  what could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a
[54:32.520 --> 54:36.120]  semi-automatic weapon this is a matter of national
[54:36.120 --> 54:39.800]  security we also need to make it harder for people
[54:39.800 --> 54:43.160]  to buy powerful assault weapons that's the ones that were used in san
[54:43.160 --> 54:47.080]  Bernadino they bought them legally i know there are some who reject any gun
[54:47.080 --> 54:49.400]  safety measures but the fact is that our
[54:49.400 --> 54:54.440]  intelligence and law enforcement agencies no matter how effective they are
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.280]  cannot identify every would-be mass shooter like the three hundred thousand
[54:58.280 --> 55:02.680]  individuals motivated by isle or some other hateful ideology
[55:02.680 --> 55:05.480]  some other hateful ideology oh just like you just
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.960]  bombed the syrian troops fighting him yesterday and turkey just invaded iraq
[55:09.960 --> 55:13.320]  to slaughter a bunch of people fighting isis to protect isis
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.600]  and the russians have presented all the evidence that not just turkey but
[55:16.600 --> 55:20.920]  western firms are buying the oil from isis oh but there's sanctions on russian
[55:20.920 --> 55:25.000]  oil i'm going to get to next hour that's okay but but but not on the isis
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.040]  oil and look i'm risking my life exposing these
[55:28.040 --> 55:30.840]  people i'll just be point blank with you there's a reason though this show is
[55:30.840 --> 55:34.200]  exploding uh we do youtube and facebook mentions
[55:34.200 --> 55:36.920]  now they used to get a couple hundred thousand views which is still incredible
[55:36.920 --> 55:40.760]  they get like nine hundred thousand one point one million one point two million
[55:40.760 --> 55:43.800]  i had like a million and a half facebook views
[55:43.800 --> 55:49.000]  yesterday on two videos i shot so the president does these things now
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.440]  his average youtube video gets like five thousand views so just know this
[55:52.440 --> 55:57.640]  almost no one buys what these criminals are saying
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.040]  but we have rama manual from way back at the beginning
[56:02.040 --> 56:08.520]  running around openly saying we will get their guns one way or another
[56:08.520 --> 56:13.880]  we will put them on a no fly list and then take their guns that way
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.040]  this is how they operate this is how they get their job
[56:18.040 --> 56:20.280]  done
[56:21.400 --> 56:24.280]  and so need to understand it's not just how it shows out here fighting these
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.720]  people there are a lot of other folks fighting them as well but
[56:27.720 --> 56:30.520]  the fact that our audience let's let's not exaggerate
[56:30.520 --> 56:33.960]  has doubled the last three four months
[56:33.960 --> 56:37.560]  and now it's starting to exponentially increase they're they're ever going to
[56:37.560 --> 56:40.360]  come after me it's probably right now because we're just
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.280]  turbo exploding hey but blow me up baby you'll just like
[56:44.280 --> 56:48.200]  fires even bigger i know what waters these trees and if i could be smart
[56:48.200 --> 56:51.640]  enough like obi-wan kenobi not to strike any of you down and let you just cut me
[56:51.640 --> 56:54.760]  down right in front of everybody you know it'll come out of that because all i
[56:54.760 --> 56:58.760]  want is to beat you i'm not afraid one bit of dying or being thrown in your
[56:58.760 --> 57:02.600]  dungeons because i'm not a coward like you i don't come from bottom feeding trash
[57:02.600 --> 57:05.480]  like you i'm not afraid all i'm afraid of is
[57:05.480 --> 57:08.120]  failing all i'm afraid of is bowing down to you
[57:08.120 --> 57:11.400]  murdering trash all i got to think about those hundreds of thousands of
[57:11.400 --> 57:14.840]  christians that you raped and murdered with the jihad armies they put into
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.520]  syria to slaughter that peaceful country and overturn it where people
[57:18.520 --> 57:20.840]  lived in peace all i think about is what type of
[57:20.840 --> 57:25.400]  government do we have but engages in these forms of incredible evil
[57:25.400 --> 57:29.640]  you baby harvesting demon maggots
[57:29.720 --> 57:34.760]  i'll never back down i'll never bow to you i'll be free till the day i stop

[57:43.800 --> 57:47.240]  never stop and you know it
[57:48.360 --> 57:52.680]  i told the globalist a long time ago in a minute you want to fight you better
[57:52.680 --> 57:56.440]  believe you've got one and there are people all over this country

[59:51.160 --> 59:59.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:16.280]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:23.880]  the attorney general linch
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:27.480]  has come out and you know said if you if you speak bad about radicalism or
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.920]  whatever or or something you say is insinuary and might lead to violence
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.360]  we're going to arrest you you said to back off that because that violates the
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.920]  first amendment you can say things that people could
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.200]  interpret as hateful or mean and that might cost somebody to be violent you
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.720]  just can't have a call to action
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.360]  and say you know we should go out and do abc
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.560]  am i going to say it because it'll take it out of context and claim i said it
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.520]  the last thing i wanted people to go out and randomly attack muslims or anybody
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.120]  else usually the idiots that do that
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.960]  go into a liquor store or a gas station
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:09.000]  and shoot a Sikh which actually have huge wars with the islamists for
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.240]  hundreds of years in india and are a big part of the british military because of
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.440]  that but people see a guy wearing a big
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:23.000]  purple or pink turban and they think hey newsflash newsflash
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.200]  it's like the idiot that went and shot up the Sikh temple and killed a bunch of
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:29.080]  people remember that a few years ago
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:34.120]  because he thought it was muslims only an idiot i mean what type of idiot goes
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.560]  to kill people and doesn't even get the right group well the type of folks in
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.960]  fact i've actually known people who get so upset
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.560]  by 911 and things i know one guy who got upset
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.040]  emotionally he wasn't even a stupid guy and he went and beat up one of these
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.800]  people at a gas station and got arrested for it
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:58.280]  so absolutely people should not attack anybody for what color they are or what
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.400]  religion and it is true most muslims just want
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.440]  to live their life and be left alone most muslim women don't want to wear
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.120]  hoods over their heads their husbands don't either
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.160]  they want to come here to get away from that but our government's been backing
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.600]  radical islam all over the world that's going around
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.080]  taking islam over and radicalizing it and lord mongden is an expert on islam
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.200]  and i've done a lot of research too and he's right there was about a 400 year
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.760]  period where the west was in the dark age
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.960]  and they were not doing all this persecution and it actually helped
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:37.480]  contribute to the renaissance so it really is true that islam has not been
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:42.280]  as radical as it is now before it's had expansionist periods it's had very
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:46.040]  radical periods it's had periods that weren't right now because the population
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.960]  is exploding because of the Saudis being the main
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.480]  force behind islam now it's bad news folks
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:58.200]  in the in the main state and and by the way that's not anti islamic or anti
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:01.400]  arab because that's where that centers you know islam's all over the world one
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:05.320]  of the biggest religions there is probably the biggest
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.960]  the bad news is for other muslims and other Arabs and
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:13.960]  other people in those areas because that's who they kill nine out of ten people
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.560]  or more killed by radical islamicist or muslims
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.920]  look it up 98 plus percent it it varies depending on what attacks
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.920]  there have been but 98 percent of terrorism worldwide is islamic
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.960]  and melissa harris parry gets up there on television
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.200]  and says don't show her in her hood don't show her in her hajib
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:40.360]  hajib or whatever it's called the burqa because this is stereotypical no lady
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:44.120]  that's what they wear i mean you got orthodox some of the
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.680]  orthodox jews cover up their faces and i get
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.840]  also that even in the times of you know made marion and the
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.920]  you know a thousand years ago in robin hood that women wore that and you know
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.960]  why they wore it because the upper classes had
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.520]  wider skin what does sports and agar mean it just means black plow man
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:07.320]  because if you came from the lower classes you had tan skin because you
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:10.440]  worked in the fields and it was an elitism to work all over the world
[01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.520]  japan to the middle east to wherever the same cultures same ideas
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.560]  women wore gloves and high heel shoes meaning they didn't have to work
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.080]  sometimes they grew their fingernails a foot long it's ridiculous
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:24.280]  and and and we see expressions of that today
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:30.200]  and women wore even their faces covered up when they went out to ride in a
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.160]  carriage or whatever because it was so much manure and stench and people
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.600]  dumping their their their their bathroom products out
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.480]  their windows and so yes women wore cloaks
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.520]  and covered themselves up the richer you were because you didn't want to be
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:46.760]  around the profane so yeah if some muslim princess went out
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.720]  500 years ago you bet she covered up she don't want to be out there
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.520]  in all the flies then it became stylish then everyone made their women do it
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.120]  and it's a style oppression
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.720]  illery clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her she was recently
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.000]  trying to censor comedy skits that poked fun at her which were produced by the

[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.680]  a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.480]  focus all of our children are hit with modern mind

[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.960]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:28.520]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.240]  drugs working with my team we set out to find the

[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.040]  evil but because of those who look on and do nothing

[01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:57.400]  it's alex jones
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.760]  make no mistake ladies and gentlemen this is the takeover of the west this is the end
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.960]  of human liberty as we know it and the birth of planetary world government
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:12.120]  being ratified and openly announced and declared as we speak
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:16.680]  in paris france lord mocton will join us from paris france
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.600]  coming up on wednesday we have other reporters there as well from the new
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:24.520]  american magazine and others that will also be joining us
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.840]  let me do this now let me try to cover as much of the news i've mentioned a lot
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.320]  of it but i want to really drill into the news
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:36.360]  big news is up on drugsreport.com hillary demands
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:41.800]  tex stop isis she also says she wants to stop banker bailouts that she helped
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.320]  orchestrate and of course i need to understand
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.400]  even the new york times admits that it lets facebook twitter and others
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.560]  restrict speech that could be deemed as quote hurtful
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:59.880]  or that disagrees and paul wrote about this a month ago we got the notice
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.240]  that if any of our speech disagrees with anyone it actually says disagrees
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:09.320]  that you may be suspended or kicked off facebook
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.480]  and it's really kind of oxymoronic because here we are on facebook we never
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.640]  really used until recently and i did two videos yesterday that have
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.480]  almost two million views combined
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:27.400]  at my house and at work just flip on a camera talk for 10 minutes a million
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.040]  people watch it
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.080]  think about that one video had 251 thousand on it
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.920]  another had 877 thousand that was last week
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.840]  if you go back there was another one i shot yesterday you had them all together
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:47.960]  look at that one from friday one million one hundred ninety thousand
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:52.360]  do you think hillary clinton likes that when she gets up before congress and
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.520]  says we're losing the info war wonder who they're talking about
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.920]  and i only bring this up because as the enemy rolls out its plan the
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:05.720]  credibility of a matt drudge now looks jones a joseph farah
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.640]  he's only going to intensify takes somebody like tucker carlson the
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.000]  libertarian he he's on wednesday with us for an hour
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.240]  started a lot of big media operations to dabble with the voice of america
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.360]  and i've hung out with him privately and stuff and you know obviously he now
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.520]  knows the season is here where he can get away with being more libertarian
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.360]  more anti-new world order because more of it's out in the open
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.520]  and the fact that he can go further now shows how much of the info war we're
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.240]  winning the fact that donald trump can come on this show
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.000]  and sound like yours truly or vice versa
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.840]  the fact that he would come on this show knowing he'll be demonized for it
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.880]  i mean i'm not going to toot my horn here but donald trump's plugged in four
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:51.320]  or five or six times the last year and i've talked to his people and him and
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.600]  others and you know obviously to anybody watching their listeners
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.920]  i'll just leave it at that so many times we call up to get a congressman or
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.880]  woman on and they go oh yeah i was listening to your show yesterday or i
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:05.320]  was listening today i'd love to come on or listen i'm a big listener
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.520]  but my constituency isn't ready for this so i can't come on
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.960]  but by the way here's some really good intel on a bill that's going to be
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.800]  introduced next week we have congressmen and women's
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.960]  offices sending us tips sending us intel but they won't come on
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.800]  committee chairman you name it but see
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.720]  dr steve pacinic called up this weekend he wants to come on i'm glad to have him
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.760]  on founder of one of the founders of delta force
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.800]  one of the heads of the founder of the hostage rescue teams
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.720]  ran some of the biggest hostage rescue operations
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.960]  also ran psychological warfare for the state department and directed the cia
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.440]  with some of their policies ran the camp david accord you name it i mean he is a
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:52.440]  big fish in all of that but this is a world now where
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.280]  folks don't know who chuck yeager is
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:01.160]  and he said no this is a major breaking point
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.360]  just like the bin laden raid being fake and the seals going public them having
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:08.600]  to kill a bunch of them just like the other bell weather
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.720]  events the pierce morgan event he said trump coming on
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.160]  signifies the death of the mainstream medium
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:20.600]  and that you are now the new media and he we're not bragging about info wars
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:26.280]  what we're saying is the enemy is in trouble the usurpers the occupiers the
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.880]  interlopers those that have come in so hillary's
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:34.760]  in the new york times hillary demands tech stop ices
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.720]  they let ices recruit they let them flying out of the us
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:43.320]  it was a project of saudi arabia nato the united states turkey
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.880]  france the uk israel pakistan
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:51.640]  she says you're going to hear all the familiar complaints that's a quote
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.120]  of freedom of speech miss clinton said in a hour-long speech and a questions and
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.720]  answers session at the sabian forum an annual gathering of
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:05.240]  broken institutions that focuses mostly on israel's security issues
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.920]  she's there at a powerful
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.200]  israeli forum basically trying to get the israel lobby
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.640]  to jump on board to restrict free speech on the internet
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.080]  and we've got zuckerberg running around meeting with the communist chinese
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.240]  leaders four or five months ago in the us on how to censor the internet and
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.040]  admitting it
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.880]  people go well that's an oxymoron why would you
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.800]  be on facebook with three million likes between all our channels one of them
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.240]  has about a million and how would you be reaching a million people or more a day
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.360]  just with videos well the point is they've got to get all
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.880]  this lined up and legally put in place first before they do it
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.480]  because it's a big deal but little sites are getting knocked off all the time
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.920]  because they don't have the power to expose it or
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:15:00.200]  have a lawsuit over it because see you can argue
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.920]  all day long
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:08.680]  that oh facebook belongs to facebook well that'd be like if you advertise
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.480]  certain prices at a grocery store but when somebody else showed up
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.440]  you said oh well that label doesn't mean for you that milk's not three dollars a
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.120]  gallon it's fifteen dollars a gallon for you
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.040]  you see you can't advertise it as a free open forum and then have info wars
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.600]  bring you millions of millions of people and vice versa
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:31.320]  in this public commons and then turn around and censor what we're doing
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.520]  so that's the battle that's taking place right now on facebook people ask
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:38.840]  well why are you on facebook i'm on facebook because we're using that
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.840]  platform to reach new audiences and then bring them to info wars
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:46.360]  bring them to the nightly news bring them to our own servers bring them to our
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.240]  own platforms that are our main base
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.560]  our main fortress but then without that we have another ring and then another
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.360]  ring and another ring and all sorts of different media
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.040]  operations because from day one i've dealt with censorship
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.480]  and hack attacks and moves to shut us down and shut us up
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:13.640]  and it's not that i was ever some super genius when it came to all this
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.000]  i experienced it like why do i have my own comment system
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.040]  so that when people make death threats the police show up here i'll just use a
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.480]  third party and then it's their problem you know it's been trial and error
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:27.560]  but now in the info war we have some of the best ideas some of the most
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.840]  accurate information and some of the best delivery systems
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.360]  outside of the enemy operation there are but we still
[01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:39.880]  engage the enemy via their platforms and when i use words like enemy folks
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:45.400]  let me tell you they're the enemy of your due process of your wealth of your
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:50.040]  private property of your children of your health of your sanity of your
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:54.040]  future you want to be usurped 21st century style
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.760]  you want to be overwritten in an info war you're experiencing it
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:02.680]  so they're declaring absolute war on the internet claiming it's to fight isis
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.680]  which they incubated they created and now they want to take your liberties
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.640]  they want to take your free speech they want to take your guns they want to take
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:13.400]  your right to travel in the name of countering people who they let fly in
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:17.080]  with fake names and fake passport
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.120]  speaking of a double standard let's look at this little stack of news right here
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.320]  falling oil prices who are the winners and losers we told you this three years
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.760]  ago bbc now breaks it down saudi ravia admits
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.080]  that they are bankrupting everyone else by having oil so low and as soon as the
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.680]  us is bankrupt and russia is bankrupt they actually say it at opa this is
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.960]  public that that after us producers are bankrupt
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:47.000]  after russia's bankrupt losing literally hundreds of millions of dollars a week
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:53.720]  the saudi's are selling oil at lower than it costs to produce it
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.240]  and once they're done then they'll jack up prices five ten times what they used
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.040]  to be that's what walmart does they come in and
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.720]  have five or six producers they pay me your contract to produce eggs at a
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.240]  glut to drive down prices then they know that people
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.480]  can't produce any more when they lower what they'll pay them
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.320]  most of them go bankrupt and they have one company to deal with
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:18.040]  these are just tactics that aren't free market folks that are monopolistic
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:22.040]  clear channel will come into a town for five years and sell advertising at one
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:25.320]  tenth what it should be until everybody else went bankrupt then they jack up the
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.480]  prices to the to the rooftops that's just a tactic folks and you need to be
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.600]  aware of these tactics i'm not demonizing clear channel
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.880]  that's what media companies do
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.840]  but the public is so childlike we talked three years ago about them lowering
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:45.240]  oil prices to bankrupt us well production canadian oil
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.640]  production others don't shut up conspiracy theorists
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.880]  there's nothing in saudi arabia no one has any power but jews
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.440]  literally hey saudi arabia's bankrupting the oil industry
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.400]  shut up stop making apologies for the jews all these mentally ill jew obsessed
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:04.520]  people so it's comical if it wasn't so serious
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.320]  and they give up their own free will people to think it's the catholics or
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.840]  the jews or any one group they don't have any power the reason
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:16.760]  you're not successful is because of the the jews and the reason i'm
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.640]  successful is not because i'm hardworking and intelligent and a good
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.640]  orator and a good manager and all the rest of it
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.040]  it's because of the jews always the same moronic idiocy it's like saying the
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:34.040]  muslims when there's like 10 different groups
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.720]  i know who the bad group is it's the wahhabist it's the saudi arabian
[01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:41.560]  scum government that's who it is and then there's other criminal groups and i go
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.840]  after all of them but falling oil prices
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.040]  who are the winners and losers goes over it meanwhile
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:55.560]  they're continuing massive massive massive
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.840]  sanctions against russia to bankrupt them and admitting it but but not isis

[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.440]  now coming up we've got trump accuses the media of glamorizing
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.600]  terrorists that's what they're doing i see i saw them glamorizing isis in al-qaeda
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:00.120]  and al-nazra the last five years and i was the first to say it
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.960]  i'm not bragging i just don't i said this is real we're going to be attacked
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.680]  we're going to have asymmetrical attacks on government building shopping malls
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:16.120]  military bases community centers uh theaters you're seeing it all
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.840]  and i believe here's the most important thing i'm going to cover when we come
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:22.040]  back and i meant to say this is the very
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.760]  start of the show but i didn't if you analyze obama's speech it tells you
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:31.800]  a lot not just they're going after people's freedoms to travel to own guns
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.240]  extra judicially just again incredible announcements every law
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:41.240]  journal should be just freaking out right now this was a declaration of war
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:44.600]  against the magna carta declaration of independence constitution bill of
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:50.680]  rights respectively in order of their production
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:56.600]  the gun grab all of that is a side issue compared to the fact though
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:01.240]  that in the in in the main he had to admit major hassan was a terrorist
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.120]  six years later at fort hood he had to admit a bunch of other stuff was
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:07.880]  terrorism because they know it's hurting them too bad saying it isn't terror
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.840]  and that blew up in their face showing them no credibility but what's even
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.480]  bigger than that
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:18.440]  he's getting everybody ready for terror attacks they have created such a giant
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:25.000]  multi hundred thousand person system and isis caught on a little too good for
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.600]  it was meant to sweep the middle east in africa for saudi arabia
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:33.080]  now it's spilling over here they may not be able to stop the attacks folks
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.200]  and they're getting ready for this or they may be behind them we're going to
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:43.480]  talk to a spy spy on the other side dr steve pochennick
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:48.040]  straight ahead and get his take on all this and more i'm alex jones
[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:51.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:30:00.200]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.480]  did you know that when you're serving jury duty you have complete authority
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.000]  over the law in the power to stop the government that's right as a juror you
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.520]  cannot only judge the defendant but also the law he's being charged with as well
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.560]  that's a little known secret prosecutors don't want you to know for
[01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.640]  example let's say a man is charged with marijuana
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.000]  possession and you don't agree with that law well as a juror you can decline
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.200]  charging the man because you don't believe the law is justified judges and
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:25.240]  prosecutors have misled juries and to believe in that they should only
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.680]  examine the facts of the case and not the law but the juror can actually stop
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.440]  the enforcement of unconstitutional laws in two ways as a grand juror you may
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.080]  refuse the government's request to pursue criminal charges against the
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.640]  accused and as a trial juror you can acquit the
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:41.000]  defendant who is charged with breaking an unconstitutional law either way by
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.680]  using jury nullification the juror has the power to say no thus having an
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.720]  immediate indirect effect on our government you can find out more from

[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.400]  and i am alex jones your host if you just tuned in for the first time
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:58.840]  as a libertarian broadcast it is naked that we have a corrupt out-of-control
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03.640]  elite that is waging war against the very free market system
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.360]  that made this country so great and we've got melissa harris perry on tv
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:17.000]  saying don't show uh this malik lady in her hajib or hajib or hood on her head
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.600]  uh because you know it it stereotypes muslims
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.040]  well i mean 99 98 depending on the year of terrorism is islamic
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:31.080]  and the biggest victim of radical islamic garbage are muslims the middle east
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.680]  and so now we see turkey running into iraq
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:38.520]  and attacking iraqi forces that we're about to take out
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.280]  an isis stronghold you've got nato bombing
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.160]  uh a military base a syrian military base that's in the associated press
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.240]  you've got turkey yesterday threatening to blow up russian ships
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:56.520]  in the mediterranean uh and urgun saying if we see any your weapons
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.920]  pointed at us we're going to attack uh shooting down the russian plane blowing
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.920]  up the rescue helicopter uh they're really mad that the russians have
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.600]  exposed that it's not hundreds of millions it's now billions in oil
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.040]  being being being trucked in uh they're now destroying that
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:15.800]  our own military and we've had colonel schaefer and countless others on
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.240]  you know told us two three years ago that our military was bucking
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:24.040]  overthrowing Assad uh and putting saudi arabian al qaeda forces in
[01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:27.240]  uh and so now you've kind of got the state department and
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:31.240]  and the cia and and and the turks and others
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:35.240]  and the saudi's trying to still win this battle of five armies
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:38.840]  that's what it is not using a tulcan uh you know term for
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:43.080]  for no reason there's like five factions at least running around in just an
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:50.040]  insane asylum uh quagmire and our government initiating this
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:55.080]  five years ago in this whole leftist organized arab spring
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:58.680]  where they then put radical the hobbyists in charge and then we have
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:36:02.840]  liberal feminists you know saying how wonderful the headdresses are and
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.000]  and and how maybe we should adopt it a sickening liberal fetish
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.600]  with fascist radical islam so you've got all that happening
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.200]  and everybody knows i exposed the you know the gulf wars and all of it is
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.880]  frauds and synthetic made up terror i started seeing the last few years
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.280]  though this whole islamic state thing and more
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.400]  really being allowed to recruit being allowed to build up
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:27.720]  being being funded by saudi arabia we we we and others exposed it
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:31.560]  now it's blown up and i have trouble even knowing where it's all going
[01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.600]  i don't think the establishment knows i think it's out of control that's why
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:37.640]  the former head of defense intelligence has come out three times now on
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:41.160]  television in the last two months and said we were ordered to fund isis and
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.760]  al-qaeda consciously it's a horrible idea i don't
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:48.280]  know what what the president's thinking to have
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:53.800]  former generals two three and four star generals on tv
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.760]  saying this is horrible shows you the military
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.120]  is just beside themselves with all of this and i'm not just saying that to
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.480]  make the military feel good make them the heroes it really is true
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.640]  and dr pechenically with us about 20 minutes into the next hour i don't want
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.000]  to just spend all day on what he wanted to come on about about the info war and
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.720]  the success of this show though it's important to admit that show the
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:16.520]  weakness of the establishment media it's not really our strength it's their
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.200]  weakness i want to pick his brain as a real expert on
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.600]  islamic terror he was involved in camp david early on the founding adult of
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:27.720]  force right through that then a bunch of big famous
[01:37:27.720 --> 01:37:31.880]  hostage situations that he helped resolve when they had hundreds of hostages
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.080]  he was also involved according to london telegraph and other major papers in
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:38.600]  the italian government with a whole bunch of other stuff
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.400]  dealing with the communists and others but he'll never speak to that really on
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:47.880]  air uh his website steve pechenic dot com but so much is happening right now
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.400]  and this is a time in history clearly where the stars are aligning
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.320]  for the good the bad and the ugly uh and so that's why i want to get his take
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.080]  on the general world but uh doctor i'd like to just throw a question out have
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:05.480]  you talk a couple minutes move the next question there's so much to talk about
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.400]  what would you like to start out with i want to start with the fact that today
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:13.240]  is december 7th when we uh in the united states government
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:20.200]  performed the first stand down in 1941 on december 7th and that was f dr
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.640]  and the attack on pearl harbour from that day on
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.760]  60 years later our government continued to do stand-downs false flags under
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:34.120]  bush cheney and we had 9 11 we had the attack in iraq that was a
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:38.120]  disaster we went to three wars that was a disaster we went into
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.840]  yemen sudan somalia nowhere along the line there are
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.440]  generals or admirals stopped any civilian president from saying this is a
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.200]  disaster it's great that all the di a operatives came out
[01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.600]  afterwards and said that this was a problem but i have asked repeatedly our
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.840]  intelligence community to stand up and stop the president of the united
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:05.720]  states be it bush cheney clinton or obama obama has been a
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:11.000]  disaster from day one his history has been nothing but a contrived
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:17.800]  absurdity about a cia operative born of a cia grandmother and mother
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:22.520]  and grandfather who had no background no experience whatsoever
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.280]  and was voted in without any vetting by the secret service
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:30.520]  the national security or any organization in the united states
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:33.640]  you and i could not have become president in the united states the way
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.360]  obama did and what did he do he created a false flag and a
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.760]  stand-down issue with the killing of osama ben lon which never occurred
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.920]  since you correctly defined 14 years ago
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:50.920]  that osama ben lon was dead so we had an admiral macraven
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:56.200]  the seal team which was just a shame it's a it's a disgrace in the united
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.240]  states that they stood up and said they killed obama
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:04.040]  osama ben lon when in fact they would have even been dead for 14 years so we
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:08.200]  have a collusion among the president united states
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.840]  was created false issues and not only in
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:19.320]  banghazi not only in osama ben lon but in sandy hook sandy hook
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:24.120]  was par excellence the description of a non-existent
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:29.240]  killing of a so-called asperger's individual who supposedly killed 22
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.400]  kids and several adults with a lot of machinery
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:37.400]  and a lot of heavy equipment it was nonsense it never occurred
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.400]  sandy hook was shut down as a school in 2008
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:48.280]  since that time obama has criminally consistently developed stand-down and
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.200]  false flags all over the united states well let's shift yours then dr
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.400]  prchenek i want to expand on this looking at the big picture
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.560]  as a guy that was at the highest levels of of your major global operations
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.520]  yes specifically what do you see happening with these
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.760]  jihad attacks happening all over europe now happening in the u.s the media
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.000]  attempting to say it wasn't jihad attack that blew up in their face
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.880]  i mean they are really making some idiot moves right now
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:20.680]  what do you think's the larger situation behind us the larger situation is that
[01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:23.720]  we are creating we the united states along with
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:29.240]  nato forces turkey saudi arabia and israel we're creating strategic
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:33.080]  tension points all over the middle east in order to create
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:37.800]  conflict so that we can control the situation first we create this
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:41.240]  organization and chaos and then we come into us
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:44.120]  presumably control the situation the middle east
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.960]  this is completely created by our capability and our incapacity to
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:53.480]  control chaos we've created the chaos through the
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.680]  cia we created the chaos through socombe
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:02.040]  and the military forces we then went into ices we created ices with the help of
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.720]  turkey and saudi arabia katar and duba and then we wanted to use that as a
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.160]  counter force to the iranian recognize to the shiites
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:15.960]  and use it as a counter force to bashar asad bashar asad would not
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:20.040]  comply neither did russia so what's happening is we're getting into a
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:24.200]  confrontation created by obama and his neocon
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.080]  advisors who again will not stand down and are supporting israel
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:33.480]  to create a position in the middle east where israel and united states
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:37.960]  can still demand that they're a muslim terrorist all over the world
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:43.080]  man for the most part i've got to be very frank the muslims are basically
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.200]  fighting the muslims it's not an issue that really concerned
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:50.040]  gee i see the civil war why are they allowing it to blow back
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:54.520]  well the blowback is simply because the san bernadino issue
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:00.120]  i'm still not sure where it stands in terms of a false flag number one
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:03.960]  it's very rare to have a standing shooting operation
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:07.880]  in an attack in a uh... office where you have
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.720]  basically disabled individuals and by the way it is
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.400]  incredible they were having a live shooting drill they this is abc's
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.920]  they were having a shooting drill now when this reportedly happened
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:22.120]  not only that they've been having a shooting drill in the
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:27.960]  center of of where disabled uh... veterans and others were living
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:33.240]  and having it on a monthly basis so that really was number one an s1 flag
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:37.720]  number two you had a woman who supposedly was in pakistan went to
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.120]  saudi arabia was west west in a hundred pounds being able to cook
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:47.720]  uh... we're a best at the same time carry guns and at the same time shoot
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:53.160]  and twitter absolutely impossible and at the same time we had a
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.120]  so why would they allow a jihad false flag and
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.200]  to be clear because there's one issue that you have brought out repeatedly
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.160]  and correctly and that was the sandy hook issue
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.680]  transposes everything we have here and that is
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:12.920]  gun control for obama his last wish and dying wish may well be dying wish
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.800]  is that we have a gun control in the united states
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.320]  that is not going to happen and at the same time
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.520]  he has really committed criminal acts against the united states
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.840]  with the help once again of our cia our intelligence community
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.560]  and other uh... elements of our government expand on that and i
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:36.520]  i've sent joe biggs to a bunch of these he never thinks they're a false flag he's a
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.560]  combat vet smart guy he says because the drill at the same
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.560]  time he says because the tweeting while the
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:44.760]  killing's going on he says because of the drill at the
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.720]  exact same time and other things he bare minimum thinks
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.760]  that they had warned people locally they were ready
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.040]  uh... not that they were involved but that higher ups open the door
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.560]  to make sure it went ahead and happened they gave them the passport they gave
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.960]  them they let her back in with a you know fake address and fake info
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:06.200]  so bare minimum they were being protected so that is a stage one
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.280]  uh... you know your partial false flag bare minimum explain something to you
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:14.200]  we have it we usually have a very effective fb i
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.680]  trust me when they're able to hand me subpoenas because i go on your show
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.080]  or i've committed acts uh... for our country thirty five years ago
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:27.000]  and then they apologize saying that we were we were spending hundreds of
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.920]  thousands to give you subpoena even though it's not appropriate there is
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.360]  they're very capable of monitoring what's going on
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.920]  and stopping anyone from coming in now it's important let's stop right there
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.880]  i didn't know you got the pain and hold on steve hold on steve
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:45.080]  steve chenex our guest yeah you got subpoena by the fb i about coming on
[01:45:45.080 --> 01:45:49.000]  my show well yeah basically because i had
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  talked about i i and i brought up in the in the in the books
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.400]  the issue of uh... the red brigade and what happened in italy although i never
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:02.200]  went into detail so i got subpoenaed by the miami day prosecutor
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:05.560]  and basically they brought in a italian
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.560]  uh... prosecutor that spoke well that's right i saw that a while back
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.880]  and correct but that's not the issue the issue is we have a dysfunctional
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:17.320]  government well that was a good piece of work you did with the red brigade you
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.920]  got to be really proud of that well i'm not proud of anything right now i'm
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:24.600]  more proud of you and what's happening to the united states because gloating
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.680]  about the past is not really the issue at hand what the issue at hand is
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.120]  you brought on trump you're speaking the truth and now
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.920]  through your vehicle we can say this president is committing crimes against
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.240]  united states as obama as cheney had committed crimes
[01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:45.640]  and bush and there is no accountability the fb i have let's go back and then i'll
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.920]  give you the floor i want to go back to the fb i because that's interesting
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.840]  uh... so specifically do they apologize to you for investigating you for doing
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:55.160]  stuff for the cio and the state department
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:59.320]  no what they basically do is say we're following orders it's like the german
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.760]  i'm not here i mean what you have now is really
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:06.360]  everybody doing their duty without really thinking twice
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:10.200]  about what they had to do i had to spend twenty thousand dollars in cash
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:13.400]  to a crooked lawyer who never even showed up at times
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.160]  to my hearing and basically uh... my wife who's based it was born in an
[01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:23.560]  american family that came in sixteen twenty eight was so furious
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.560]  she started to yell at the uh... prosecute and say how dare you
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:32.440]  bring in an american military officer who was a deputy assistant secretary to
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  answer questions to this incompetent italian fool
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.920]  but that's not the issue the issue at hand is we have the continuation
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:46.680]  of corruption and and and crime and this is where america has to say it's enough
[01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.040]  we don't have a year left for obama to finish out
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.720]  obama will create more false flags he's not in charge
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.440]  the cia probably with brennan and with a d and i and with a whole bunch of
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:01.800]  others who are involved that you've never heard of so calm
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.360]  or the the fact that we've uh... used mercenary soldiers and we've used
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:09.560]  special forces and we've taken off the appellate
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:14.520]  to go in there as non-combatants basically and fighting in the rules of
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:18.920]  engagement that we're not used to what's happening is we're creating a
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.480]  fear dynamic which is blown up by the uh... republicans
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:28.040]  and at the same time hillary is totally not qualified to answer it
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.240]  the only thing that can happen is we need an immediate change of government
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.280]  with somebody like trump who can begin to assess
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.040]  what's going on and perhaps let's go back to dr pacenic let's go back because
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.040]  you were excited about the trump thing and saw it as a key c change point
[01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.320]  uh... so so let's break down why you think that interview is so important
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:51.960]  well that the reason that interview is important for fourteen years you have
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.080]  been carrying the water in an amazing way to
[01:48:55.080 --> 01:48:59.160]  disseminate the truth as we truthers and others who understood
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.080]  what was happening in the government we're trying to get out in terms of an
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.800]  outlet you were the only one on the radio and tv quite frankly
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.880]  who said you know what dr pacenic i don't know you but i suspect that you're
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.520]  correct when i said fourteen years ago
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.200]  that whoever is going to be president united states and i didn't know who would
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:22.680]  be president or did anybody would basically declare that he
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.200]  was going to be victorious by having killed osama ben ladd
[01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:30.840]  and of course the idiot obama and mcgrave and and the rest of the steel
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.240]  team and the rest of the intelligence community
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:37.560]  fell for that scyops and let's go further a year after you were on and three
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:40.520]  years after you were on fourteen years ago the secretary of state manuel all
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:43.880]  bright came out and said exactly what you said he's dead they're going to roll
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.480]  him out and then even walter kronkite said he talked to high level folks that
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.600]  said that was true so we know this is going on
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:55.160]  but but for me it's significant let me get to the point to the american public
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.320]  you are important because basically you have been the game changer
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.720]  in the entire business of the media now i've known the media very well from the
[01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:07.960]  new york times the wall street journal all of them roger ills
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:11.560]  basically their job is to get ratings
[01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:15.240]  and to get money for whatever content they produce
[01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.520]  your job which i really didn't know from the beginning was to
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:23.800]  assess the facts that were out there and thanks to your own intuitive
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.320]  knowledge and sense of righteousness you went on to say
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:30.680]  okay let me hear what the alternatives are and
[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.360]  you've continued with it and in that sense to me
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.880]  you represented the american public the public i knew
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:41.560]  the people who worked hard the people who had to earn a living
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.440]  the people who went to jobs on a daily basis not the politicians like hillary
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  or obama or bush who were entitled little brats
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:54.920]  who never spent a day in work who never went and served the military
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:59.240]  who never had to pay a mortgage who never had to pay anything else
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:03.160]  other than the money that they accrued from book sales
[01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:08.520]  and self-aggrandizement those days are over and what happened is you allowed a
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.800]  trump to come in thanks to mr roger stone
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:14.920]  whom i've known about since the reagan administration
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:19.400]  and he was brilliant enough to say you know what we're going to legitimize
[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:24.360]  the people who've been out there called the truthers and the wackos the 20
[01:51:24.360 --> 01:51:27.560]  million of us who basically are saying
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:33.320]  bush janey obama you're wrong not only are you wrong you're criminal well to show
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.280]  your inside baseball i didn't know you know stone
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.800]  i knew of stone i didn't know how much high-level stuff he was involved in
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.840]  i mean elections in the third world folks put two plus two together
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:46.520]  uh but uh he's really a really great guy i'm trying to get him back into town
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:50.440]  next week uh and the the behind the scenes stuff i
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:54.840]  learned trump knows a lot more obviously than he than the public knows
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:59.160]  and stone was basically talking about how many really good people in the
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:01.640]  government are basically saying what you're saying
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:04.920]  that that none of them were ever perfect but they now realize
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.400]  this country is going to be brought down if we don't turn things around and stop
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:13.160]  this hijacking of the government by select groups at the top
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:16.680]  i agree with you not well i know a roger stone i don't know him personally
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:20.200]  but i've had a lot of respect for him but i've had an immense amount of respect
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.800]  for trump and i'll give you an example when he went on your radio
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:29.320]  he went into detail about afghanistan that we sent our boys to die there for no
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:33.000]  reason while the chinese are picking up rare earth
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.200]  lithium and all the other minerals and he was right on
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:40.360]  then he talked about inversion which hillary clinton has no idea about
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:43.880]  obama has no idea because he thinks that goman fax
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:49.000]  is a brilliant entity although he knows if it's crooked as the day is long
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.200]  and this is the kind of man that we need right now
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:55.720]  we don't have a year and if i can say anything to your audience
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:01.880]  we do not have one year left to live out this administration stop right there
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.640]  steve i want you to skip this break it's so important i want you to flesh out
[01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:09.480]  because a lot of people say and trump said well you know it'll make him a
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.000]  martyr politically if we go after him he's in so much trouble
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.880]  you know i don't know if we have time in the next year but my concern is
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.680]  the way obama is acting the way his people are acting the way they're
[01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:23.160]  getting really nasty and and really making more and more stuff up
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:27.640]  they're acting like they're getting ready to move against the american people
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:30.920]  and so if you agree with that i'd like to know what you think we should be
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:36.360]  watching out for what they might pull well what i agree with is that he is out
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.920]  of control and he's never he's not he's
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:43.400]  fronting for an organization that's consisting of the pritzker's the
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:49.320]  chicago rami emmanuel who by the way was being prosecuted for incompetency
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:53.640]  lying in distortion even by the new york times and what we had it was a
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:59.240]  distraction in san bernadino from his good friend and buddy from childhood
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:04.200]  rami emmanuel and the chicago mob and that's part of what san bernadino was
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.800]  about was that to take away the attention when the new york times asked
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.760]  for the resignation of rami emmanuel and the entire government of chicago
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:15.960]  so what we expect to have is more denial
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:19.560]  more crime and more distortions to the truth
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:24.120]  what we need to do is to initiate a referendum where we will ask the
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:28.200]  president to step down i do not want an assassination
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.680]  what i want is a referendum where the people say we can no longer wait for a
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.960]  year we do not want anyone else and we will want to
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:41.240]  nominate by choice trump and either we have the elections
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.920]  now or we don't have the elections we do not have one more year
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.240]  and all this nonsense that's going on where isis is supposedly
[01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:52.760]  creating terrorist attacks all over the world which they're not
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.400]  quite frankly if they're you got to remember the two leaders of isis
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.840]  the soul and the military arm were both in our prisons and bag dead for over
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.800]  eight months and if anybody in your audience believes
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:09.000]  that we in the military and the intelligence community
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.240]  didn't double up these guys and isis should know this and every sooni
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:16.360]  they would have never been released they would have been given acid baths
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.920]  if they weren't double agents they are double agents for us so anybody who
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.960]  follows these fools knows that they're following
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:27.320]  cia and military intelligence operatives
[01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:31.240]  who've been doubled by us easily and then we create
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:36.920]  the false flags the the false enemies which basically we claim are muslims
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:40.440]  the muslims are not our enemy they are the enemies perhaps the
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  israel who has a problem with their survival but we are not
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:47.800]  i'll say this obviously wahhabi is being brought in
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.200]  is meant for there to be attacks so the government's bringing him in they are
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.120]  at the top of the food chain guilty let me be very frank in my business and they
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:01.560]  know this from my past experiences it's easy for me to take out the wahhabi's
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:05.400]  and the salafis in Saudi Arabia and practice that
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:10.120]  that's the easiest work i can do but fortunately they're not letting me or
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.800]  others do that kind of work because they're easy to neutralize
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:17.240]  the way they were neutralized in other countries and other worlds which i was
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.360]  involved with but unfortunately our government
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.240]  is involved in creating these episodes like bush senior was involved in
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.480]  allowing noriega to start agitation propaganda why
[01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:33.880]  because he wanted an excuse to stand in the 80s absolutely but here's my
[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:37.640]  question i think they've misjudged the calculus
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.920]  to be able to bring in radical jihadis have them attack us and then take our
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:45.000]  guns and restrict internet free speeches hillary's trying to do i see
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.280]  how they brought them in to let them do it i get it's a false flag ultimately
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.960]  because they brought them in correct i just don't see how they think they'll
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.320]  get away with that well let me put this one i i really
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.000]  have to look back at san bernadino and you look at komo uh
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.160]  the komo the interviewer the newspaper and the and cb on cbs or abc where he
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:08.920]  asked the lawyer uh you know there are many holes in this story
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:12.360]  number one both the husband and wife were handcuffed
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.720]  number two they were able to twitter while they were shooting
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.880]  number three you know you have a high military operation
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:23.880]  where even if you were black widow you couldn't be trained in this particularly
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.200]  if you're 90 pounds and the other general and the other man had no idea of
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:32.680]  how to deal with military capacity but there was a third man who nobody
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:35.880]  talked about my point to you is this is consistent
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:40.440]  with sandy hook once you have lied once you have contrived
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.080]  false scenarios just go all the way seriously
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.080]  be a liar and you will continuously be well there is some evidence that the
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:50.040]  husband and wife were decoys and the rather shooters and that's usually how
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.760]  you do it correctly that's exactly what i must
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:55.720]  but the issue isn't this the issue is much greater
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:59.640]  do we can we continue with the criminal like obama
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:02.920]  who is protected by incompetent secret service
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:09.400]  that has been rife with uh prostitution alcoholism dr virginic stay there we
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.520]  gotta go to break in 60 seconds stay there we're gonna come back and we're
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.520]  gonna get into some of his uh anti-terrorism operations he was in
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.680]  because there's some interesting what he can talk about a lot of it
[01:58:18.680 --> 01:58:22.280]  still partially classified uh but really interesting fellow and yeah when he
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:25.480]  comes on the show then i guess they try to indict him and stop
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.600]  for the things he talks about so i don't know the audience realizes the stuff
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.120]  you're hearing here i mean this this guy's really is very interesting uh to

[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:17.400]  five minutes segment here 12 minutes segment coming up uh with dr steve
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:20.120]  pacenic we've got a reporter from sam bernadino
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:23.240]  california joining us with via video and audio feeds
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:26.760]  at the bottom of the hour joe begs and others
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.880]  adan salazar just ran in here and he said what dr pacenic just talked about
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:32.680]  there being other reported shooters is is true and i remember seeing that in the
[02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:35.560]  news but we have a cbs news clip we're gonna put the computer we're gonna
[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:40.280]  play later next segment where one witnesses said no there were
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:47.240]  three tall white males with guns that were shooting people
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:51.640]  there was an active shooter drill there i mean the mathematics of that happening
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:54.680]  and this happening i get it i really haven't gone there my
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.560]  reporters have i've been attacked in the washington post over it
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:02.520]  because i don't care they opened the door and brought these people in to begin
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.760]  with
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.880]  so it's a false flag anyway you slice it but i tell you
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.160]  i'm so sick of everything being a false flag but it just the evidence just
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.760]  mounts and mounts and mounts and then the fact
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:19.960]  they think we're so dumb that they would let people attack us or bring them in
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:23.000]  or do it and then blame our guns and blame
[02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.680]  the internet for it really shows how stupid they think we are
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:29.560]  dr pacenic we only got three four minutes left in this segment long one
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:32.200]  coming up but uh specifically what do you make of
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.200]  that and then let's start talking about real terrorism that you've actually
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.600]  dealt with real terrorism doesn't occur on a false flag
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:44.120]  when i had to deal with a hanasi muslim in 1978
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.520]  carter had created the situation accidentally and i had a hundred i had
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:53.480]  500 hostages in three buildings the fbi correctly called me in under the
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:57.720]  auspices of the u.s prosecutor and what i did was to take the
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:01.560]  koran and basically use the talents of three
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:06.120]  muslim ambassadors uh yahoo khan gurbal and zahidi
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.960]  one egyptian and one iranian and we were very effective
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:14.120]  in disarming a man who had killed about four or five people
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.920]  that was real terrorism and that was the first time
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:22.440]  the issue of stopping a mohammed film and the fact that we had to release
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:26.520]  hostages was an issue and i didn't release any hostages and i and i didn't
[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:31.080]  allow him to continue he was declared mentally ill but i knew his
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.240]  background and basically we disarmed them even though jenny carter was not
[02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.120]  very helpful and i was disobedient the point
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:41.800]  here that i'm trying to say to your public and you have said repeatedly
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:45.640]  is you must be disobedient i'm asking our military and our
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:49.960]  intelligence officers to be disobedient because if you're not
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:54.280]  you're going to destroy this country and the only reason why i survived
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:57.960]  was i was a navy captain a deputy assistant secretary of state and i said
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.920]  to the president you're wrong and i you stand down or you fire me
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:07.400]  and i continued i did the same thing again when it was in panama
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.880]  where bush tried that and i explained it to the cia operative said if you
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:14.920]  continue this i will get you into trouble i did the
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.400]  same thing in cambodia where the cia got involved again
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.960]  created distortion denial and we disarmed them using other techniques that i
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:27.480]  cannot go into so the primary problems we have in the
[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:30.920]  united states is not muslim or christian or
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:35.560]  any religion or ideology it is that the functional aspects
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:39.080]  of a cia and intelligence community that has grown
[02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:42.840]  out of proportion we now have 16 different intelligent
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.640]  units that do absolutely nothing our paid trillions of dollars
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:52.840]  is run now by a navy admiral who really never had any experience in
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:57.240]  intelligence was a submarine commander was run before by a general
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:00.920]  who was in g2 and had many degrees but this cannot
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:03.960]  continue we do not have a congress a president
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.320]  or a military and intelligence that is viable
[02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:11.640]  and concerned about our national security and that's where america has to have
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:15.080]  the american revolution in a way that's productive and
[02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:20.600]  constructive why you are important and why trump was important is you are the
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.520]  game changer you are the expression of that american revolution
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:28.360]  in the 21st century to allow the truth to come out
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.400]  st augustine said don't worry about the truth
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:35.480]  let it do what it does best to destroy those who distort the truth
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:40.440]  so i quote st augustine and i say to the american people please don't give up
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:43.640]  and don't give up hope stand by what you believe
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.920]  and demand a referendum to get this president out
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:50.520]  and demand accountability from bush clinton and others
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.600]  for criminal acts we'll be back we will win we'll be back stay with us under
[02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:57.400]  chenna circus
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.720]  hillary clinton wants to censor people who make fun of her she was recently
[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:05.000]  trying to censor kami's skits that poked fun at her which were produced by the
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.680]  laugh factory in los angeles california the owner of the laugh factory jimmy

[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.520]  might have the money scientists turned to religion for climate action yeah
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:24.280]  they're now trying to fund groups to stop the satanic denial of that
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:27.960]  we've got venezuela opposition is basically taking over the

[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:36.360]  years that's some of the news up on drudge report dot com
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:40.520]  upon info wars dot com obama six years later calls for hood
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:46.600]  a terrorist attack jp morgan and city group agrees that the u.s economy is
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:50.920]  steamrolling towards recession oh they finally come out and set it
[02:10:50.920 --> 02:10:54.440]  former congressman joe walsh goes on anti-islam rant
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.000]  dares loretta lynched to prosecuting regardless what you think of islam or
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.360]  radical islam don't you have the free speech
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.240]  now we've got a non-salazar in the control room i want to introduce this
[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:08.360]  clip we'll get dr pacinic's take on it
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.960]  saying that how was there a drill at the exact same time
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:17.320]  of this happening with armed military police there
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:20.920]  i mean that that is super rare and it just keeps happening at false flags and
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:24.440]  then you've got witnesses saying they saw white guys running around
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:28.760]  we'll see the globalist up above it may have had the police there for a drill
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:32.520]  to confuse everything even more in case something went wrong see a lot of times
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.240]  the drill isn't people that are part of it
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.040]  that's why they had folks in the seven seven bombing admit we were running a
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:40.360]  drill the exact same trains and exact same bus
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:43.720]  being bombed at the exact same time scotland yard was part of it
[02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:47.080]  well they weren't part of it to go on the news and say it's crazy we were
[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:52.760]  running a drill they were hired for smog for confusion for fog of war
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.760]  in case any of the false flaggers got caught then they just say oh it's part of
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.640]  a drill or or maybe dr pacinic can correct me and
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:03.160]  explain how that works but they also bootleg the funding for attacks but
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.480]  listen there were real bombers as best we can tell they were being handled
[02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:11.480]  by a mi6 operative who again was a wahhabist
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:15.640]  so it's the sickening saudi arabian deal with western intelligence
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.360]  to wind up these loons let them hit us and then they take our freedoms away
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:24.440]  but let's go ahead and go to this clip um adan salazar brought it to my
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.560]  attention you're backing up with dr pacinic was just saying
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.400]  earlier um tell us about these two clips adan
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.440]  well we were really careful not to jump on the whole false flag narrative uh
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.040]  first off because everybody expects info wars to you know claim every mass
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.360]  shooting is a false flag which you know obviously they aren't all false flags
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:49.160]  but this one we were careful not to call it a false flag from the beginning and
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.760]  then this week last night i saw an intel hub piece
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:57.240]  where uh one of the writers was analyzing a cbs news piece
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.000]  and have we posted the whole article yet lady they're interviewing
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.120]  uh she claims she saw oh she says she was inside the inland regional center
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:09.400]  when the shooting happened and she describes three
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:14.120]  shooters uh white male tall wearing military gear
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.880]  which doesn't fit the uh description that you know
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:21.960]  of the uh assailants at the end it wasn't the uh muslim
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.320]  they weren't two muslims a male and a female she said specifically she saw
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:29.800]  three males so here's that clip if we want to run it let's run it
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.120]  you know why would we hear shots as we look out the window a second set of
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:40.440]  shots goes off and it's just pop pop pop pop pop pop and we saw a man fall to
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:44.760]  the floor then we just looked and we saw
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  three men dressed in all black military um
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:53.160]  no period tire was best on their holding assault rifles
[02:13:53.160 --> 02:14:00.680]  and they they opened up the door to building three
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:03.640]  and one of them opened up the door to building three
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:11.400]  he starts to um brave shoot he just you know shoots all over into the room
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:15.400]  that's the room that we typically have conferences in and i just
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.160]  we just heard more gun shots go off right that's sally
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:21.960]  abdominal guide i think is how you pronounce it there's other witnesses
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:25.640]  saying the same thing there's the intel hub uh read by uh shepard ambulance
[02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:28.760]  a pretty good website i'm he he's a really great guy
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:31.560]  i love them to look at their side haven't looked at it lately uh eyewitness to
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:36.680]  terror attack three tall white men did it boy msnbc will have a
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.960]  heart attack of joy if they get to do that and make it racial
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.640]  uh but this doesn't fit with the other witnesses said about how they made the
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:48.040]  christians and others beg for their lives uh so do they piggyback something
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:50.760]  that woman sounded pretty credible i know we have another clip
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:54.120]  let's get dr steve pochennick's take on what he just heard
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.520]  i don't think that i think that's very credible because since 9 11 we've had
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:02.600]  the same type of dynamics we have the white guys
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:05.720]  creating the problem then blaming it on the
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:10.200]  muslims in effect the muslims have not been a major part of this problem the
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:14.360]  major part of this problem has been us you know when uh
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:20.280]  the enemy is really us and this is the problem and unless we start to indict
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:23.880]  past presidents the present president and get rid
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:28.120]  of all of this nonsense in our intelligence in our military community
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.720]  we're not going to succeed and we're headed for self-destruction
[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:36.360]  obama is part of this uh cheney was part of it it doesn't matter with your
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:40.760]  democrat republic and liberal conservative the republic is
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.880]  deteriorating and it's self-destructive this is the modus operandi of what
[02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:48.520]  happens when you have an intelligence community
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.880]  that is totally out of control has no oversight
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:55.960]  and we have no ability to control what's going on okay i see the evidence of
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.520]  false flag uh that they open the doors at least let
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:02.280]  them in i mean that's open and shut this makes it even more suspicious
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:05.080]  i just can't believe they would be that reckless but i mean look what they've
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:09.400]  already done as you said well then the narrative the the calculus
[02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.560]  it blows up in their face if they bring in radical jihadis and let them attack
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:16.200]  us why would they do that well we see it come
[02:16:16.200 --> 02:16:19.320]  after our guns come after our speech and say we must
[02:16:19.320 --> 02:16:23.800]  comply to radical islam so they don't kill us is that the calculation
[02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:28.920]  no the problem is they're not smart enough to figure out what you did and i'm
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:33.240]  not trying to lodge you i'm just simply saying they didn't put in their
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:36.920]  calculation and nine eleven that there will be an alex
[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:42.440]  jones and a dr pacenic who wouldn't a year later predict that 13 years later
[02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:45.800]  the president of the united states would claim he would kill a man who was
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:48.840]  already dead that's the problem with all of the
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:52.280]  strategic false flags they're not smart
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:56.680]  and they think the american public is dumb the american public is not dumb
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:00.280]  plus the fact you have alex jones and 20 million listeners
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:04.200]  plus the fact that we have the internet and it works both ways
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:08.840]  the internet may expand and create fear but at the same time in the hands of an
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:15.560]  alex jones or dr pacenic or or trump it it reverts we can use it as the weapon
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.800]  they did not expect that to happen they were not prepared for that
[02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:23.960]  and that's why they kept monitoring me in particular as you said to me
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:27.480]  thousands of operatives monitor me of course they monitor me
[02:17:27.480 --> 02:17:31.080]  they know my history well i mean i've been off record visited
[02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:37.320]  by the u.s agencies and foreigners and and i've gone
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:40.280]  ahead and met with the people and you know they just point blank say we're
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:43.320]  deciding what to do with you and i just go do whatever you gotta do i'm gonna
[02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:45.720]  keep doing what i'm doing you've got those visits as well
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.000]  i just don't think the average person out there understands how serious this is
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.440]  but here's the good news dr pacenic i've had former heads of special forces
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.960]  current generals people in congress contact me and say
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:59.160]  we're rooting for you we appreciate what you're doing and so there are a lot of
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:02.840]  good people in the system as well they are but they have to act
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:08.520]  there has to be a core of defiance by the special forces by our intelligence
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:13.000]  community and for that trust me i will pay a price later on
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:16.680]  because i normally get emails from the intelligence community saying i've gone
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:19.320]  too far or i would get another subpoena but
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:24.440]  i'm willing to do this to say to the american public enough is enough
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:30.280]  our country is out of control the salafis and the wahhabis they're a problem
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.880]  but if you want to have the problem neutralized we could have neutralized
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:37.800]  that decades ago well i agree well i have a saudi's messing with me too
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:41.240]  they know that i don't i mean they know that we don't like their organization
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:45.320]  because no we don't and but remember it's the bush family you're talking about
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:48.360]  marvin and neil indicted for s and l scandals
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:52.440]  you're talking about bush the senior indicted for nine eleven
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:19:00.760]  and 2008 bush jr i mean 2008 financial crash now we have jeb bush who was
[02:19:00.760 --> 02:19:03.880]  involved in the transition from one illegal government
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:07.960]  to another whose whole history is based on illegal activities
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:11.240]  in florida i know all i'm saying is that we got to go to break
[02:19:11.240 --> 02:19:13.960]  we got to go to break when i come back adana's another clip and we'll get some
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:17.960]  final comments from you i'll just be honest i don't want the credit
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.000]  because it's so dangerous this is a scary job
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.280]  i never intended to be this successful but what you're saying
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:27.320]  is actually true and accurate and i was actually told this
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:31.400]  basically by some of the trump people they're aware of what's going on
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:35.080]  and it's just beyond a science fiction movie i just can't believe that
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.520]  that uh that other people didn't stand up and fight the globalist and but the
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:41.800]  good news is it shows the power of the people
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:46.200]  my listeners my audience is the real power and that's what the globalists are
[02:19:46.200 --> 02:19:49.560]  afraid of and the good news is i've already gone to seed
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.520]  they can take me out but people already get the paradigm
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:56.520]  the transmission's already sent so i hope i'm a little bit safer because i don't
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:20:00.600]  want to mess with these people we use mobile devices right against our
[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:03.160]  bodies every day but growing scientific evidence has

[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:13.080]  welcome back i'm your host Alex Jones we put together a compilation of obama
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.720]  saying there's no such thing as basically radical
[02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:19.800]  islamic terrorists and that we're just scared of women and orphans
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:22.840]  that's all coming up then joe biggs from the ground
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.320]  in san jim bernadino california and i think what
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:30.440]  dr pacinic saying is yes they're radical islamicists yes there's
[02:24:30.440 --> 02:24:34.120]  well obvious out of saudi arabia but the core problem is our western
[02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:37.480]  governments are working with them and i agree with them
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:41.080]  they're funding them to go into these countries
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:44.920]  to destabilize the area and we've had so many top generals come out and say we've
[02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:48.120]  been ordered consciously to do it it's wrong it's evil
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:52.200]  and then the media spends it former head of defense intelligence says we screwed
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:55.800]  up but then you actually watch the clip that's not what they're saying so
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:59.400]  that is disobeying orders saying that on national television
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  that is bold and so i think what dr pacinic's calling for is starting to
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:06.280]  happen one of the most dangerous things you
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.600]  can do though is to call for people to do what they're doing in government
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:14.120]  but it's even more dangerous to let a criminal outside group take over like
[02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.040]  this let's remember these are illegitimate
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:19.640]  groups that are doing this it's criminal this is a guy hijacks a plane as
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:22.600]  we're in the pilots uniform doesn't mean he's the pilot
[02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:25.800]  i think that's what pacinic's getting at but adan salazar
[02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.760]  the reporter pointing this out to us we're posting the entire
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:32.840]  in telehub article at info wars dot com right now
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:35.960]  with the video but good job for the journalist groups out there
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:39.160]  ferreting this out and playing this out what's this other clip
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:42.360]  this is of sally abdelmagid the employee of the
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:45.800]  inland regional center and it's the other half of the interview where
[02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:49.800]  scott pellet i think is the cbs anchor that's interviewing her
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.920]  he asks her if she's certain that she saw three men and she confirms
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:25:57.960]  and then at the end of the clip he says well now we know that
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:03.640]  it was a male and a female so wow staying with the script let's go to it
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:07.400]  i couldn't see his face he had a black hat on
[02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:14.120]  and um from my view all i could see was just a black hat and black long
[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:20.440]  sleeve shirt possibly gloves on um he had black cargo pants on the
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:24.280]  kinds of zippers on the sides in the big puffy pockets
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:31.000]  uh he he had a huge assault rifle and he had extra ammo he is
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  coming ready for he's coming ready for something
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.200]  to reload i don't know he had like magazines
[02:26:38.200 --> 02:26:42.040]  um i i couldn't see what else i saw it was
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.440]  i just saw three dressed exactly the same you're you're certain that you saw
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:49.400]  three men yes it looks like they're
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:55.640]  came home yeah he's white they looked like they were athletic bills
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:02.600]  and um they they appear to be tall
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.960]  and then he goes on to me by the full clip and repeats it's a man and a woman
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:09.880]  this could be though because there was a drill going on and then she's not into
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:13.640]  guns and people are shooting and she's confused but still the fact that they're
[02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:16.520]  be a drill at the same time dr pacinic closing
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.120]  comments on this what you're seeing is the
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:25.480]  collusion between the media and the government let me make it very clear
[02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:29.240]  for example when osama ben lon was not killed
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.040]  the cia immediately opened an office and and literally dictated the script for
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:38.040]  zero dark 30 i reprimanded that i was thrown out of
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:42.520]  the producer's guild and then eventually brought back in on academy awards
[02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:47.000]  what you have is repeatedly somebody like anison cooper bringing in bob bear
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.160]  anison cooper worked for the cia as an intern still works for them
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:55.400]  you have bob bear who was a cia operative who was really out of control
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:59.960]  in the middle east and literally gave you the storyline for siriana which
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:03.560]  glorified his position so what you're having throughout the
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:06.680]  media people who were in the intelligence business
[02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:09.880]  and then twisting those stories around for their own gain
[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:13.880]  most of them are not heroes most of them are not great
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:17.160]  americans what they are is very greedy individuals
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:21.240]  who want to make money who make money on this kind of business where they offer
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:24.280]  protection where they offer some kind of position
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:29.400]  but for the most part these are frightened individuals when 9-11 occurred
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:33.160]  and two cia operatives had to admit to me what had happened
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:37.320]  as well as military intelligence you have to realize that almost everyone who
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.760]  works in our government and either intelligence or military
[02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:44.600]  is beholden to a paycheck well do you remember the rumsfeld clip that came
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:48.600]  out where he's with six generals and they say sir we may need another 9-11
[02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:52.040]  can we please have one yep and it's being recorded
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.200]  and that's the thing that's so crazy is that you've you said you'll testify to
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.480]  congress that you were you know council on farm
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:02.600]  relations meetings and there's just open discussion of this
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:05.880]  i mean when i've had these foreign governments come visit me
[02:29:05.880 --> 02:29:09.560]  they're just very honest about this and they go okay well you know it's a
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:12.120]  false flag but you don't hate our country and i'm like no i don't hate your
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:14.280]  country and you know a bunch of governments are
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:16.760]  involved yes i know a bunch of governments are involved and i just
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:19.560]  can't believe that even these groups i don't say this to make me sound big
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:22.520]  because i don't like this they're actually scared of me
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:25.800]  and i just don't want them to stop saying my kids belong to the state and they
[02:29:25.800 --> 02:29:31.160]  want my guns doc i just want to cut them because you are protected by the truth
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:34.920]  and the fact that there are many people who care about you and the fact that
[02:29:34.920 --> 02:29:40.040]  trump came on was a major major game changer the likes of which
[02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:43.800]  people still don't really understand stay there i want you to finish

[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:51.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:56.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:56.680 --> 02:30:03.480]  did you know that when you're serving jury duty you have complete authority
[02:30:03.480 --> 02:30:07.000]  over the law in the power to stop the government that's right as a juror you
[02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.200]  cannot only judge the defendant but also the law he's being charged with as
[02:30:10.200 --> 02:30:13.400]  well that's a little known secret prosecutors don't want you to know
[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:16.680]  for example let's say a man is charged with marijuana possession and you don't
[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:20.120]  agree with that law well as a juror you can decline charging the man because
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:23.480]  you don't believe the law is justified judges and prosecutors have misled
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:26.520]  juries and to believe in that they should only examine the facts of the case
[02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:29.480]  and not the law but the juror can actually stop the enforcement of
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:32.840]  unconstitutional laws in two ways as a grand juror you may refuse the
[02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:36.200]  government's request to pursue criminal charges against the accused and as a
[02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:38.760]  trial juror you can acquit the defendant who is charged with
[02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:41.640]  breaking an unconstitutional law either way by using jury
[02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:44.120]  nullification the juror has the power to say no
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:47.640]  thus having an immediate indirect effect on our government you can find out more

[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:23.720]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:27.880]  i know one thing for sure when the new york daily news comes out and has one of
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:30.440]  their journalists say that the conservatives
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:34.440]  that were basically killed there deserved it because they were conservative
[02:33:34.440 --> 02:33:38.840]  we're dealing with some sick freaks and the whole leftist ideology in this
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:43.160]  country has just mutated into brazaro land again i've said this a
[02:33:43.160 --> 02:33:46.840]  thousand times i'll say it again thomas jefferson was what i'd call a
[02:33:46.840 --> 02:33:49.960]  liberal george washington is the country's first
[02:33:49.960 --> 02:33:55.800]  conservative i admire both men i would be a liberal in 1776
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:59.080]  these liberals today are freaks and i know
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:02.840]  conservatives can get real weird and wartime and stuff too but man
[02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:06.360]  you know i mean i look i tune into msnbc and it's like some type of soviet
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:10.440]  brainwashing channel i mean they're so weird they're so
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.600]  manipulative they're so cult-like we're gonna be talking
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:18.440]  more about that we have a compilation of a video that do put together titled
[02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:21.000]  obama caught running isis it's very powerful
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:24.200]  then joe biggs will be joining us from sam bernadino and then right into the
[02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:26.600]  fourth hour paul joseph watson from london
[02:34:26.600 --> 02:34:29.640]  maybe we've gotten into the economics the uh trump news
[02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:33.560]  there's so much more but i think the good news here is
[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:36.920]  this radio show other radio shows folks like the intel hub
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:41.080]  intel hub that was breaking that other news everybody the alternative media is
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:44.680]  becoming the dominant media in numbers not just
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:48.120]  not just in having more credibility and it doesn't mean we have all the
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:51.880]  answers either uh but the establishment is out of gas they have
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:55.240]  no credibility and you've got these different criminal camps
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:58.280]  they're trying the same old thing and i just wanted to say to dr pacenek
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:02.120]  briefly and get his brief response he's got to go and we've got to go
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:06.600]  he was on a few months ago and he said you know at the cfr and all the rest of
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:12.600]  it i fed the line that jeb bush had run knowing that once he got back in we used
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:16.520]  9 11 on him and then i see trump start using 9 11 on
[02:35:16.520 --> 02:35:19.960]  him and then i have some discussions i'll just leave it at that
[02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:23.720]  and that's indeed what they're doing is basically baiting
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:28.120]  the media in to attack him as a 9 11 truther and then he's going to destroy
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:31.960]  the clinton's and the bushes with it but they were smart enough it got real big
[02:35:31.960 --> 02:35:36.600]  and then crickets no stories 2000 plus stories and then no stories
[02:35:36.600 --> 02:35:41.000]  the word went out shut that down so now obviously i can let everybody in on the
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:45.960]  hat trick uh because you know now the
[02:35:45.960 --> 02:35:50.520]  this particular task of the fishing rod lure was somewhat successful but not
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:53.640]  fully successful plus it's good to let them know
[02:35:53.640 --> 02:35:56.440]  that they're not the only ones that play games
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:36:00.600]  okay so i'll just leave it at that and again i'm not here with some agency i'm
[02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:03.960]  not being advised by people i'm just here common sense
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:07.000]  and then i talked to pacenek and then i talked to some other people and they're
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.040]  on the same page and i wonder if they know each other pacenek says they don't
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:14.120]  but it's just people that get what's going on uh and know how to respond to it
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:18.440]  but that is pretty exciting pacenek well not only are you correct but let me
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:21.080]  give you an example cornell university which
[02:36:21.080 --> 02:36:25.240]  considered a left uh a liberal school produced three of the most
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:30.360]  fascist neocons sandy burger died fortunately recently paul
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:34.440]  wolfowitz and steve hadley all involved in 9 11
[02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:39.000]  sandy on behalf of clinton paul wolfowitz and and uh
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.680]  the other person on behalf of a bush and they were all in quiller
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.800]  and dagger uh secret society of cornell which i do nothing about
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:52.680]  harvard university mass mental health involved in the storyline of the false
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:56.680]  flag and sandy hook as well as Yale psychiatry department
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:59.880]  i indicted all of them and they couldn't respond
[02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:03.480]  and i indicted them of corruption of moral corruption
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.600]  and financial corruption and they couldn't say a word
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:09.720]  those are three major universities and believe me
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.320]  once you have those universities in a state of fear
[02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:17.160]  now you have a real problem because it's gone to the educational level the
[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:21.000]  media level the government level and i'm not being paranoid this is very
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.400]  what they can't deal with is that now the military the police the local
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:28.440]  governments know the narrative i mean the governor of texas pretty much
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:31.160]  listens every day i'm not going to brag about it i don't want to get into
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:34.600]  inside baseball they're in trouble and more and more
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:38.200]  we're willing to be attacked we're willing to be killed i guess if we have
[02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:41.400]  to be and i don't think they know how to deal with people that aren't cowards
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.680]  like them well the point is your influence and i
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:48.840]  know for example at rutgers university in new jersey is immense
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:53.480]  it is absolutely immense and and that feedback doesn't come back to you but it
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:57.640]  comes back to me through the professors your influence on the students in
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.000]  cornell at harvard and yale is far greater than they
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.680]  realize and the people who've been brought in as the dupe
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:08.440]  of those universities believe me they've been bought out by sandy wild of city
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:11.320]  bank for example cornell university medical college
[02:38:11.320 --> 02:38:15.560]  which was an elite medical school 180 years in existence
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:19.320]  changed its name from wild medical college it was bought
[02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:25.400]  and totally bought out and grafted by sandy wild a total crook from city bank
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:29.480]  and now it's called wild medical college the same thing with i can't i can
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.880]  medical college and get in medical college so what you see is happening is
[02:38:33.880 --> 02:38:37.080]  the money of the private sector is co-opting
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:41.560]  any of the institutions we have at the same time co-opting the political
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.000]  and and and military industrial complex
[02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.760]  that's why our generals they are so bloated and there's so many of them
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.680]  more than it ever been in world war two i don't have a george marshall
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:56.760]  so we you and i are in effect acting as the george marshall to say
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.440]  get rid of these four star generals get rid of these three star admirals
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:04.440]  get rid of these bloated political generals who really are not of great
[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:07.640]  service what i needed a captain of the majors and lieutenants
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:10.920]  who will not make it up the system and i asked them again
[02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:15.080]  to seriously understand what you are following through those who have
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:19.800]  committed false flags or have gone into killing americans or anyone else
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:25.160]  will pay the price believe me i have always been successful in retribution
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:28.920]  and that the cia knows that the intelligence community knows that
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:33.160]  and the military knows that that's why they always hand me a subpoena
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:37.640]  and they monitor me repeatedly because i don't make false promises
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:41.720]  and they will pay whether it's trump who comes in and makes them pay or
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:45.000]  others who are in the institution that will make them pay but they will not
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.520]  continue to do this and obama is unnoticed
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.280]  and you have a secret service who knows more about any of our president
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:56.520]  has never been able to come forth as an american institution
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:59.400]  i've been told by the secret service i'm just gonna leave it this and not
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.880]  specifics they didn't break any laws they just
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:04.440]  said it's worse than you know it's worse than you say
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:07.560]  when i've had banjino on who was the head of their foreign detail he said it's
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:10.600]  worse than you say alex they say it's so
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:14.520]  insane i wouldn't believe it dr pacenics deep pacenic dot com we
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:16.520]  appreciate you coming on power for an interview
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.120]  we'll talk to you again soon sir and god bless you and your audience thank you
[02:40:20.120 --> 02:40:23.720]  very much for having done everything you did no no thank you sir
[02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:26.920]  so i don't like to get on the show here and talk about how big we are and how
[02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.960]  effective we are but at this point we have to because the enemy already knows
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:33.160]  that and i like to kind of be under the radar over the years and just being
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:36.360]  effective but now believe me imagine there's not
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.920]  many shows like this and what do you think government's tuning into
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.840]  and i'm just a guy from texas that analyzes it and has experts on and
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:47.720]  i just want my country back i don't have any personal beef for these people
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:50.600]  i was screaming at obama last night during the peace i did because i'm just
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  sick of it man blaming the second amendment for the g-hotties he brought
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:57.800]  in i don't know what really happened all i know is you're not taking my
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:01.640]  freedoms buddy and then they got freaks at msnbc and the new
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:06.920]  orc daily news saying the conservatives deserved to have their heads blown off
[02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.080]  what what it just doesn't compute that you're such freaks
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.840]  you just you you run everything too that's dangerous you people are scum
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.120]  you have no good taste i mean i'm calling you names because that's what you
[02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:22.360]  are
[02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.760]  people are dead you're saying that they're bigoted scum that deserved to die
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:32.600]  because because they said they were a christian i mean what's your problem
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:37.800]  seriously we're gonna go to break come back with bigs for two segments
[02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:40.920]  please support the broadcast we've got the deep cleanse back in we've got it
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:43.080]  five dollars off first time we discounted it

[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:56.520]  but right now let's go to this powerful piece that uh rob do and i put
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:01.240]  together this piece of headline obama caught
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.080]  red-handed running isis here is the report
[02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:09.080]  last night on my orders america's armed forces began strikes
[02:42:09.080 --> 02:42:12.920]  against isle targets in syria u.s counterterrorism officials asking
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:16.600]  why are isis fighters driving so many similar trucks
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:20.040]  and where are they getting them from how do we know that the uh arms that
[02:42:20.040 --> 02:42:24.440]  are going to the syrian rebels are not going to get into the hands of isis
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:28.840]  because if we had people who could were there to funnel it to the right people
[02:42:28.840 --> 02:42:32.200]  and i know these people and i know who they are and i know how to do it and
[02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:35.480]  show to other people you are basically saying that even in government at the
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:38.920]  time you knew those groups were around you saw this analysis and you were
[02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:41.640]  arguing against it but who wasn't listening
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:45.560]  i think uh i think administration in an interview with the new yorker magazine
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:49.960]  it compares groups linked to al-qaeda to an amateur basketball team
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:53.560]  intelligence officials in pakistan say a local commander from the terrorist
[02:42:53.560 --> 02:42:57.400]  network islamic state has admitted receiving funds transferred via the
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:00.360]  u.s he made the confession while being interrogated
[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:04.040]  today we learned that the same group may now be in possession of a deadly
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:07.640]  cash of american-made firepower stinger missiles
[02:43:07.640 --> 02:43:10.840]  do you think it was a willful decision a willful decision to go supported in
[02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:15.400]  surgeons he had salafist al-qaeda a willful decision to do what they're doing which
[02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:18.840]  which you have to really you have to really ask the president
[02:43:18.840 --> 02:43:24.360]  what is it that he actually is doing as i said before this aspect of our strategy
[02:43:24.360 --> 02:43:29.400]  was moving too slowly but the fall of ramadi has galvanized the iraqi government
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:33.080]  so with the additional steps i ordered last month we're speeding up training of
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:36.600]  isle forces including volunteers from sunni tribes
[02:43:36.600 --> 02:43:40.920]  and on bar province now u.s military aircraft have dropped ammunition in areas
[02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:44.840]  held by isle terror group in iraq according to volunteer forces were
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:48.200]  fighting the terrorists american helicopters dropped boxes of weapons
[02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:51.480]  india 3 and balad districts in the salafi province
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:55.000]  we now hear that president obama will ask congress for
[02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:01.240]  5.3 billion dollars to equip and train iraqi soldiers and quote unquote
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.560]  moderate syrian rebels to fight the islamic state militants reports say the
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:10.680]  u.s military has air drop weapons for for the isle on several occasions
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:13.640]  last month i ordered our military to take targeted action
[02:44:13.640 --> 02:44:18.280]  against isle to stop its advances do you know that he made the air force drop
[02:44:18.280 --> 02:44:21.880]  leaflets telling the ices truck drivers to get out that
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:25.560]  bombs were going to fall did you know that did it does anyone know that he
[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:28.680]  did that this is going to make people think twice
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:32.760]  about this guy this is not as clear as it may be of he's just a pacifist or a
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:36.840]  liberal there's something more here donald and it's been more than a year
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:42.440]  now ices's capabilities seem to be expanding
[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:46.760]  were you aware that they had the capability of pulling off the kind of
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.160]  attack that they did in paris are you concerned and do you
[02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:55.000]  think they have that same capability to strike in the united states
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.640]  the unclassified reports have estimated that in just the first 12 months of
[02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:05.960]  renewed ices operations in syria and iraq they recruited more than 22 000
[02:45:05.960 --> 02:45:11.800]  foreign fighters at least 4 000 are westerners so those are americans
[02:45:11.800 --> 02:45:16.600]  brits french citizens german citizens it was very disturbing to pull this from
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:22.520]  the new m website in september that says of the 381 412
[02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:26.120]  arrivals that came across the mediterranean sea
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:32.920]  this just this year up to september that 15 percent were children 13 percent
[02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:39.480]  were women and 72 percent were men such a backlash against syrian
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:42.200]  refugees coming to the united states after the word
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.120]  that some of these attackers may have passed through syria 31 governors
[02:45:46.120 --> 02:45:48.920]  now say they don't want them living in their states many presidential
[02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:52.360]  candidates calling for a ban or religious test congress moving for a
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:56.520]  moratorium on new refugees they point out there's an extensive vetting
[02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:59.240]  process that includes the intelligence community the
[02:45:59.240 --> 02:46:02.120]  departments of state and homeland security in fact george
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:07.560]  concerns in syria is that we don't have the systems in place
[02:46:07.560 --> 02:46:11.960]  on the ground to collect the information to vet
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:15.640]  that would be the concern yes i think that's the challenge we're all talking
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:20.520]  about is that we can only query against that which we have collected
[02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:23.720]  you can't account for what you don't know and that goes to the intelligence
[02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:27.640]  deficit that i think is uh embedded in your question but apparently they're
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:32.040]  scared of widows and orphans coming into the united
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:35.720]  states of america as part of our tradition of compassion
[02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:39.320]  just as terror threat unlike any europe or the us has seen before
[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:44.360]  it's the ultimate stealth weapon for isis a female suicide bomber is like a
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:48.440]  stealth precision weapon stealth precision weapon brian and this is a
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:51.800]  major change in strategy thanks to our military
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:55.000]  and counterterrorism professionals america
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:59.400]  is safe we may have somebody who comes to us
[02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:02.520]  and is simply not on our radar for any discernible
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:06.040]  reason and there may also be the possibility that somebody
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:09.320]  decides to do something bad after they've been admitted
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.240]  through the process we do not close our hearts
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:22.040]  to these victims of such violence
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:27.480]  and somehow start equating the west the issue of refugees with the issue of
[02:47:27.480 --> 02:47:29.560]  terror constant they're reaching out to various
[02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:33.000]  countries that have been fighting isis uh in syria and iraq urging
[02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:38.040]  followers to attack in their home country the fbi is still gathering the
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:42.520]  facts about what happened in san bernadino but here's what we know
[02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:46.200]  the victims were brutally murdered and injured by one of their co-workers
[02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:50.200]  and his wife so far we have no evidence that the killers were
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:53.000]  directed by a terrorist organization overseas
[02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:56.280]  or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:00.360]  because we have the clearest indication yet that that shooting rampage two days
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:05.640]  ago in san bernadino california was an act of terror inspired by isis new
[02:48:05.640 --> 02:48:09.400]  details about the couple involved in that deadly san bernadino mass
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:12.760]  shooting including a statement of support for isis
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:17.240]  by the female shooter tush bean malik but apparently they're scared of
[02:48:17.240 --> 02:48:22.680]  widows and orphans isis has been a main concern of the us through just this
[02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:27.880]  sort of radicalization not directed plots but people who follow isis
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:30.920]  propaganda through their relentless outpouring of
[02:48:30.920 --> 02:48:35.720]  propaganda around the world every day in june 2015 iraqi officials reported
[02:48:35.720 --> 02:48:40.120]  that as many as 500 children were kidnapped by isis to serve
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:44.840]  as suicide bombers and child soldiers anybody who had a chance to see those
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:47.800]  kids
[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:52.360]  hopefully you understood the degree to which they're just like our kids
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:57.560]  new islamic state video shows boy soldier execute two alleged russian spies
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.200]  one way from when you describe them as a jv team
[02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:04.360]  is that was that bad intelligence or your misjudgment keep in mind
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.560]  i wasn't specifically referring to isil as i said before this aspect of our
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:13.240]  strategy was moving too slowly but the fall of
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:15.640]  ramadi has galvanized the iraqi government
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:18.760]  so with the additional steps i ordered last month we're speeding up training
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:22.840]  of isil forces including volunteers from sunni tribes
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:25.800]  in anbar profits
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:31.080]  that's a powerful piece we're going to be posting the full video of in the next

[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.840]  the u.s continues to target syrian military blowing up their bases to help
[02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:47.880]  isis and the turks have gone into iraq where the
[02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:52.120]  where the iraqis were defeating an isis enclave and have blown them to bits
[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:55.560]  and turkey says they're preparing to attack russian ships so there you go
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:59.160]  that's who runs our governments complete psychopath demons

[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:11.320]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're about to go into the fourth hour i'll do
[02:54:11.320 --> 02:54:14.920]  five more minutes and then with joe biggs in this segment and in the next
[02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:18.120]  about 12 minutes total then we'll hand the baton to paul joseph
[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:21.560]  watson watson may want to keep biggs over some i'm not sure
[02:54:21.560 --> 02:54:24.280]  but biggs will be coming back to austin soon and after the holidays they're
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:27.480]  going to go back out around the country to more
[02:54:27.480 --> 02:54:31.160]  jihad and radicalization centers around the country they were out covering
[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:33.720]  that on the east coast when this happened
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:36.760]  obviously predicting that attacks would be taking place
[02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:40.120]  it is a false flag they open the door and let him in but but now
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:43.080]  there's mounting evidence of the drill and more this is really looking
[02:54:43.080 --> 02:54:47.400]  suspicious what we do know is obama's blaming our second amendment
[02:54:47.400 --> 02:54:50.680]  and we have this article left his journalist victim of san bernadino
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:53.320]  shooting deserved it because he was conservative
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:58.840]  i can't believe a woman named lydia or a linda stasi she really has the
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:04.280]  name of the german secret police would actually make statements like this but
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:07.800]  we saw similar statements from other news channels
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:12.680]  joe biggs that's got to really freak you out being there on the ground
[02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:15.880]  right there at the memorial where 14 people were killed i mean this is
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:20.760]  sickeningly evil she'll probably get a Pulitzer prize for saying that though
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:23.240]  yeah it's pretty interesting and like you said we're standing outside of the
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:26.600]  memorial center at the inland regional center in san bernadino
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:29.640]  and uh you know i was listening to uh your interview with uh steve patinik
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:32.360]  earlier you know and a lot of things he says uh
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.200]  i have to agree with and the fact that uh you know earlier today adan sent me
[02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:39.480]  that email with those videos and you know when you go back over and you watch it
[02:55:39.480 --> 02:55:42.600]  that first-hand account of how they were describing the people that were
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:45.720]  coming through shooting it's really odd when you see this
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:50.680]  unfold you know days later and what the narrative has been pushed out
[02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:56.840]  continue with what's developed in the last 24 hours
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:55:59.960]  well you know as yesterday like we said yesterday the father
[02:55:59.960 --> 02:56:04.280]  of saeed fru came out and said that his son had admitted to him that he did
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.680]  support isis he had pledged his allegiance to uh you know alabak daddy the
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:11.800]  leader of isis and then last night you have
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:15.720]  president obama coming out saying that the people in america
[02:56:15.720 --> 02:56:19.800]  are afraid we're scared which i don't quite frankly agree with whatsoever i
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:22.840]  don't think we're scared i think the person who was scared is president
[02:56:22.840 --> 02:56:25.560]  obama he uh never seems to want to do anything
[02:56:25.560 --> 02:56:29.320]  especially for the american people or the interest for us whatsoever he always
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:33.080]  seems to be doing everything he can to help and evade the enemy
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.160]  well joe obviously when i thought of it you and leah were already on it
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:42.280]  but you've got to get to this lady we need to see her on camera describe this
[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:44.840]  be clear you know explain that she actually saw the
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:47.400]  guns recoiling because it could have been part of the drill
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:51.160]  if she sees that and she sounds credible but if you're able to vet this and get
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:53.720]  an interview with her this is going to be bombshell
[02:56:53.720 --> 02:56:57.640]  and if she is for real which she probably is she's probably being threatened
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:59.800]  right now well she's probably already been gagged by
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.800]  now at this point in time well try to get to her and find out go to her house
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:07.080]  i don't care do whatever you obviously have to this is a priority
[02:57:07.080 --> 02:57:11.640]  i witness a terror attack three to all white men did it uh this is just uh
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:15.720]  over the top uh to see this and then to have the drill happening at the exact
[02:57:15.720 --> 02:57:19.400]  same time now she may have thought that guys in the drill were part of the
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:23.400]  shooting so we need to get you there and and really you know gauge it with her
[02:57:23.400 --> 02:57:26.280]  on camera uh but uh obviously she needs to be
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:30.120]  talked to well well the thing is uh the the police officer
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.320]  yeah the police officer i spoke to uh two days ago i believe it was
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:37.880]  he said that he was a third officer on scene his partner was a second officer
[02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:40.360]  on scene these guys are all in police uniform
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:43.640]  there weren't anyone else that came in before that so
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:48.600]  the first actual police responders the first people there from what he said
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:52.680]  were actual cops and not people that would be dressed up in SWAT uniforms
[02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:55.800]  so that's definitely an interesting thing for her to see that you know could
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:58.680]  it be confusion could it be the adrenaline pumping not knowing what's
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:02.920]  going on just being scared and just seeing people running it's hard to
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:06.200]  but she sounds pretty clear she sounds pretty clear twice
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:09.160]  about what she saw and again there was a drill though
[02:58:09.160 --> 02:58:12.760]  were they part of the drill yep right down the street to my right a few miles
[02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:15.480]  up through that's where it was taking place and they have been known to be
[02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:17.880]  happening right here at this exact location as well
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:21.640]  in the past few months i don't know joe you've you've gotten mad at folks that
[02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:24.920]  said other stuff was false flags you were in paris you were at other events but
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:29.160]  you said day one you smell a false flag what this one i do because there's
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:31.960]  way too many things out there that just stick out i mean there's a lot of
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.000]  things that do not add up no they don't stay there stay there

[02:59:55.640 --> 03:00:00.120]  all right joe bigs will also be on the nightly news tonight filing a report and
[03:00:00.120 --> 03:00:03.320]  more he's coming back to austin here very soon with our great crew and they've
[03:00:03.320 --> 03:00:17.560]  got a lot of hd video they're going to be compiling on their investigations into
[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:22.360]  islamaberg and other facilities detroit you name it there's only leg one of
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:25.560]  what's going to be a three-part investigation two more parts coming
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.400]  uh shifting gears out of whether this was a false flag or not they let them in
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:32.920]  they protected them they attacked us i believe more of this is gonna
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:39.320]  continue to happen but job looking at obama saying everybody agrees we should
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:41.880]  you know if you're on a no-fly list you don't get guns well though they put
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:45.640]  innocent people on those it's made up those are a fraud
[03:00:45.640 --> 03:00:50.360]  uh and and complete garbage this is an outrageous announcement
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:55.800]  that he wants laws passed uh to just put us on magic no
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:00:59.240]  even spark that to even come up in conversation that's what i'm saying
[03:00:59.240 --> 03:01:03.880]  either person involved was on a no-fly list so why does that pop up in regards
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:06.920]  to what happened here and like you said there there's been people who've known
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:10.040]  to be preppers people who who work in uh homeland
[03:01:10.040 --> 03:01:14.440]  insecurity that are even on the no-fly list so anybody could get put on it
[03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:18.040]  and then that could stop those people from being able to purchase a weapon to
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.160]  protect themselves i just don't understand where his
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:24.920]  reasoning comes in because he wants to be able to put us on list with no no
[03:01:24.920 --> 03:01:28.760]  court it's it's called dictatorship yeah but i but i mean i just don't understand
[03:01:28.760 --> 03:01:33.720]  how people in large numbers don't see through that no i get it there's no
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:37.720]  logic it's an inversion of reality they're waging war on common sense
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:40.200]  i mean the fact that like i said right before i went to break the fact that
[03:01:40.200 --> 03:01:43.560]  he's saying that americans are scared i don't believe americans are scared i
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:47.320]  think they're pissed off they're fed up they're angry at the fact that we have
[03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:49.960]  the leader of the free world who was quite frankly
[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:54.120]  what uh a retired lieutenant colonel said last night live after the interview
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:01:58.120]  a pu-55 yankee i don't want to say the word out but i mean if you spell it out
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:01.080]  you write down a piece of paper you understand what i get this lieutenant
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:05.320]  colonel live on tv on fox business called the president that last night and
[03:02:05.320 --> 03:02:09.240]  indeed that is what he is he is the one that is scared he is the one that is uh
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:12.760]  helping these guys out he is the one that's bringing this in this terror
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:15.880]  and then saying that we're scared we're not scared we're angry we want a president
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:19.080]  who's going to stand up and do the right thing and protect our country
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:22.760]  and make sure that they have our best interests in need this guy does not
[03:02:22.760 --> 03:02:26.040]  he is treasonous he should be impeached but like you said we're about a year
[03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:30.440]  away it's not going to happen well it it it needs to
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:35.240]  i mean just they need to back off i mean let me tell you this is a hardcore group
[03:02:35.240 --> 03:02:38.200]  when on a bunch of channels they said well there was a christmas tree well
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:41.480]  they were jews they were christians and then now they just come right out and
[03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:47.560]  say it hey in major newspaper hey it was a guy was a christian that's bigoted
[03:02:47.560 --> 03:02:50.760]  he was the problem i mean what type of freakazoid
[03:02:50.760 --> 03:02:54.920]  thinks that much less puts it to newspaper
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:02:58.840]  yeah i mean this this whole story just stinks to high heaven
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:01.800]  you know we're gonna in a minute we just found the location of where the actual
[03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:04.200]  shootout was we're gonna go out there and investigate that
[03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:07.320]  i see if we can see any bullet holes in the fence or anything like that
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:11.640]  because i mean it's really odd to have you know your supposed dead suspect on
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:14.440]  the ground and uh they're both handcuffed it's a
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:16.760]  little weird well what about when they let msnbc
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:19.800]  end to contaminate the crime scene two days after
[03:03:19.800 --> 03:03:24.600]  and the bed hadn't even been thrown nothing the walls hadn't been torn out
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:29.640]  yeah i mean i mean i would i that place had hardly been rifled through
[03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:32.680]  yeah but they're saying but yeah exactly the police are saying oh we were done
[03:03:32.680 --> 03:03:35.480]  with that we'd already cleared it we'd gone through everything that's just
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:39.560]  super suspicious and that even sounds like something that was staged
[03:03:39.560 --> 03:03:42.120]  in order to kind of help push the narrative they're trying to get out
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:45.800]  there yeah i tell you who goes in and shows us
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:49.960]  if that goes against journalism 101 you don't show people's ids and things like
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:53.160]  that especially when there's an ongoing investigation no one knows what's really
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:56.600]  going on it seems like they're like hey look at this this is how it really is
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:59.560]  see it's right here see look this is how it is and instead of just letting the
[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:02.680]  evidence come out well point to that the standard operating
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:06.280]  procedure across the board is being turned off they're flying in plain loads of
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:10.440]  people and not even looking at their ids and telling us in the news
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:13.800]  and they're they're they're i mean normally they for months that have been
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:16.120]  walled off it had torn the walls out torn it all out
[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:19.800]  we're told it's a bomb making factory we're the bombs once we get in there
[03:04:19.800 --> 03:04:23.240]  uh it's hard it's hard to believe that that could even be in there i walked
[03:04:23.240 --> 03:04:26.520]  over that's a very small area um it's close to
[03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:29.640]  it to everything these are like little uh duplexes
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:33.560]  every garage is beside every garage all through there there's no way that in this
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:36.920]  amount of time you guys shot some amazing ground footage
[03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:40.040]  your reports are at info wars dot com on the news tonight

[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:45.240]  refugee in germany injures to police officers these are the orphans and
[03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:49.000]  widows that barack obama says we shouldn't be worried about
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:53.880]  a refugee shouted pro-isis slogans while attacking two german police officers
[03:08:53.880 --> 03:08:57.560]  who are responding late on sunday to reports of a railfare dodger in a
[03:08:57.560 --> 03:09:02.520]  railway station in the northwestern city of osnabrück police said monday so
[03:09:02.520 --> 03:09:07.480]  this is just breaking right now the man has been identified as a
[03:09:07.480 --> 03:09:10.840]  moroccan asylum seeker by police in the german state of
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.400]  lower saxony no evidence linking the suspect to isis has emerged
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:22.040]  although he was shouting ala akbar and pro-isis slogans while biting and
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:26.760]  attacking police again a refugee who had just recently come in
[03:09:26.760 --> 03:09:31.400]  from morocco another one of these orphans and widows that we have should
[03:09:31.400 --> 03:09:34.360]  have no concerns whatsoever about according to
[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:39.960]  president barack obama which leads me to this story out of brightbot.com
[03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:47.960]  migrants on video paris attacks good by 2025 all of france will become muslim
[03:09:47.960 --> 03:09:51.960]  when asked on camera whether it's good to kill french people for ala
[03:09:51.960 --> 03:09:56.440]  muslim migrants seeking asylum in italy answered affirmatively
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:59.640]  remarking that it's good to kill french people
[03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:03.960]  and warning of a looming december 8 islamist attack on rome
[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:07.960]  that's tomorrow of course we know all the isis propaganda
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:11.720]  is centered around attacking italy they see that as
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:15.640]  the beginning of the final battle for their caliphate
[03:10:15.640 --> 03:10:19.160]  but in a disturbing new video produced by the italian television program
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:23.960]  larriaccia tira what's trending pres presenters as some asylum seekers and
[03:10:23.960 --> 03:10:28.040]  other migrants what they thought about the november 13 paris attacks
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:32.040]  the program interviewed migrants at the largest refugee center in europe
[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:35.560]  located in the sicilian province of catania
[03:10:35.560 --> 03:10:38.840]  asking what they thought about the paris massacres
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:43.560]  listen to what they said remember these are the orphans and widows that barack
[03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:47.400]  obama says we've got nothing to worry about
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:51.080]  so they asked christians about it first one christian migrant of course the
[03:10:51.080 --> 03:10:55.160]  vast majority of the refugees pouring into europe and not christians they're
[03:10:55.160 --> 03:10:58.600]  muslims four fifths of them aren't even syrian
[03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:02.440]  so they asked a christian migrant from africa what he thought about the paris
[03:11:02.440 --> 03:11:06.120]  massacre he said i'm sorry sorry for paris we are christians we
[03:11:06.120 --> 03:11:10.520]  don't kill presenters then asked the muslim migrant
[03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:13.880]  whether he thought the slaughter of over a hundred people in paris
[03:11:13.880 --> 03:11:19.960]  was a good or bad thing good good the man replied press further whether he
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:23.960]  thought it's good to kill french people the man responded yes
[03:11:23.960 --> 03:11:28.680]  french it is good to the third question whether it's good for a muslim to kill
[03:11:28.680 --> 03:11:33.640]  for a la the man again replied yes again which is in line
[03:11:33.640 --> 03:11:37.240]  with all the polls especially the pew survey which i've highlighted
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.720]  which shows that the majority of muslims in most middle east and south asian
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:46.040]  countries agree with this they think that stoning women is
[03:11:46.040 --> 03:11:50.360]  acceptable beheading gay people killing people who
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:53.560]  try to leave the religion of islam is all perfectly
[03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:57.160]  acceptable so there's no surprise that when they go and ask these
[03:11:57.160 --> 03:12:00.840]  migrants in these camps in italy they come back with
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:05.160]  many of the same responses the article continues
[03:12:05.160 --> 03:12:08.680]  the program interviewed a 23 year old muslim migrant named
[03:12:08.680 --> 03:12:12.680]  armad who's been in italy for five years who shared his opinion of the paris
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:15.240]  attacks as well as the future of islam in europe
[03:12:15.240 --> 03:12:18.200]  outside the mosque in katania armad told the journalists
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:23.640]  that quote by 2025 all of france will become muslim
[03:12:23.640 --> 03:12:27.160]  look he said referring to the paris massacre it wasn't us foreigners who did
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:29.960]  this they were born there kids like these who grew up and
[03:12:29.960 --> 03:12:33.000]  learned things about isis and islam and they did it
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:37.800]  what i'm saying he continued is that our quran said these things
[03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:42.520]  so even the muslim migrants there in the camp in italy admit
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:49.320]  that this call to violence is in the quran it directly orders muslims to go
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:53.000]  and kill the infidels and the passages are right there for everyone to see
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:56.920]  but of course barack obama is still afraid to even say the term
[03:12:56.920 --> 03:13:01.080]  islamic terrorism so they interviewed all these
[03:13:01.080 --> 03:13:04.920]  migrants at this camp they praised the paris attacks
[03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:07.560]  and these are the people that are going to be coming into europe they already
[03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:10.680]  have in that case they're going to be coming into america
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:14.520]  and again obama says they're just orphans and widows and there's nothing to worry
[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:18.920]  about you go back to germany where we just had another attack on police as i
[03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:23.320]  just mentioned the hospitals there are completely
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:26.920]  failing to cope with this migrant invasion
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:29.880]  and they're actually having to hire security guards
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:33.480]  to be with the nurses during nighttime hours
[03:13:33.480 --> 03:13:38.520]  in these german hospitals because these migrants are just attacking the nurses
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:41.960]  they're lunging at the nurses who are trying to give them free frigging
[03:13:41.960 --> 03:13:45.720]  health care biting them this is the culture that we're
[03:13:45.720 --> 03:13:50.280]  importing into europe and of course isis again is bragging that
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:54.840]  it's going to infiltrate the west via this refugee program
[03:13:54.840 --> 03:13:59.960]  this is out of the hill isis has targeted refugee program to enter u.s
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:04.760]  chairman says intelligence officials have determined that islamic extremists have
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:08.040]  explored using the refugee program to enter the united states
[03:14:08.040 --> 03:14:11.880]  the head of the house homeland security committee said on monday this just broke
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:15.800]  an hour ago michael mccall declined to go into
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:19.640]  detail about the determination which the obama administration has not
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:23.640]  announced publicly again orphans and widows that's all
[03:14:23.640 --> 03:14:28.920]  all the obama will say about it yet the disclosure could add ammunition
[03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:32.520]  to critics of the wyars's refugee plans who have warned that the program is
[03:14:32.520 --> 03:14:36.360]  vulnerable to infiltration by adherence of the islamic state
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:41.480]  isis really do you think maybe you should actually go and read
[03:14:41.480 --> 03:14:46.200]  isis's own manifesto their own propaganda where they brag
[03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:50.280]  about how they're going to exploit this refugee program to infiltrate
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:54.600]  jihadists just as they did for the paris massacre
[03:14:54.600 --> 03:14:58.200]  they actually went down to the hungarian border where these refugees were coming
[03:14:58.200 --> 03:15:02.440]  in and hired some of those individuals who carried out the attack
[03:15:02.440 --> 03:15:06.280]  of course the mastermind himself behind the paris attack
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:11.320]  bragged about he was able to how he was able to exploit this migrant red carpet
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:15.400]  to plan the bloodshed in the capital of france
[03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:19.000]  so we had this article last week which didn't get much attention
[03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:23.880]  isis brags about exploiting refugee program to send sleeper cells to europe
[03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:27.800]  a newly uncovered 99 page manifesto produced by the islamic state
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:32.120]  brags about how the terror organization has exploited the refugee program
[03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:35.960]  to send jihadist sleeper cells to europe since 2012
[03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:40.280]  with the goal of creating muslim no-go zones in western cities
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:44.760]  that can be used as a base from which to launch further paris style attacks
[03:15:44.760 --> 03:15:50.120]  so if you actually read this full manifesto which i did
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:53.960]  it says basically brags brazenly that they're going to exploit the refugee
[03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:57.640]  program to create muslim ghettos like the one in
[03:15:57.640 --> 03:16:01.480]  mollenbeek brussels belgium which was the source
[03:16:01.480 --> 03:16:06.440]  of the planning for the paris massacre it was the ghetto that we walked into and
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:10.600]  got chased out got told that we couldn't go in a restaurant
[03:16:10.600 --> 03:16:14.360]  because we were white basically so that's what isis wants to do they want to
[03:16:14.360 --> 03:16:18.120]  create more of those no-go zones where police are afraid to venture
[03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:22.280]  where they can get weapons military-grade weapons on the street within an hour
[03:16:22.280 --> 03:16:27.000]  for 500 euros and then and they're going to exploit
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:31.160]  the refugee program to do that and yet still we've got this narrative
[03:16:31.160 --> 03:16:37.400]  that it's just about orphans and widows and we saw that again
[03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:41.880]  after the attack in san Bernardino of course loretta lynch came out and said
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.600]  that we need to keep an eye on people who are spewing
[03:16:46.600 --> 03:16:51.720]  anti muslim rhetoric now she's had to walk that back to some extent this is
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:55.480]  out of politico.com lynch recalibrates message on hateful
[03:16:55.480 --> 03:16:59.560]  speech attorney general loretta lynch monday appeared to recalibrate
[03:16:59.560 --> 03:17:03.160]  remarks she made last week that suggested the justice department could
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:06.200]  investigate speech deemed hostile towards muslims
[03:17:06.200 --> 03:17:10.360]  of course we prosecute deeds not words she said at a press conference
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:13.800]  some conservatives criticized lynch for her comments to a muslim civil rights
[03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:17.000]  group where she lamented quote the ability of people to
[03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:21.640]  issue hateful speech of all types from the anonymity
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:25.720]  of a screen but if loretta lynch really wants to
[03:17:25.720 --> 03:17:31.240]  crack down on violent and hateful speech maybe she should start
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:34.760]  with the quran because there's quite a lot of it
[03:17:34.760 --> 03:17:40.680]  in that book she also said quote you know i think i can't say definitively
[03:17:40.680 --> 03:17:44.040]  right now what led either of these two people in
[03:17:44.040 --> 03:17:47.960]  reference to the san Bernardino shooters to pick up guns
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:52.360]  and become murderers said loretta lynch well
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:56.040]  i'll give you a clue loretta it begins with
[03:17:56.040 --> 03:18:00.760]  is and ends with lamb i think that was probably
[03:18:00.760 --> 03:18:04.680]  one of the key motivations as to why they did this
[03:18:04.680 --> 03:18:08.680]  coming up after the break and we've got a ton of more news to cover we're going
[03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:12.920]  to go to your calls as well they're now saying on msnbc and
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:17.560]  this is melissa harris perry we're going to go to this clip after the break
[03:18:17.560 --> 03:18:23.800]  that the new york times was wrong to publish the photo of tash fiend malik
[03:18:23.800 --> 03:18:29.720]  the san Bernardino shooter the wife of saeed farooq they were wrong to publish
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:33.960]  the photo because it might have been offensive to muslims
[03:18:33.960 --> 03:18:37.240]  melissa harris perry actually said that this is the same
[03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:40.600]  presenter who says that your children belong to the state
[03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:45.960]  she wears tampon earrings and now she's saying that it's offensive to muslims
[03:18:45.960 --> 03:18:50.680]  that the new york times published the photograph of this terrorist
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:55.560]  and she's not the only one an al jazeera employee as i tweeted a couple of days
[03:18:55.560 --> 03:18:59.080]  ago said that it was wrong to show the terrorist
[03:18:59.080 --> 03:19:03.080]  face quote because it's disrespectful it hurts the poor
[03:19:03.080 --> 03:19:07.320]  jihadist feelings boohoo if she was wearing a burqa that
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:11.320]  covers her face it's disrespectful to show a picture
[03:19:11.320 --> 03:19:16.440]  without so he was actually concerned about the feelings of the
[03:19:16.440 --> 03:19:20.520]  dead terrorist and her family simply because
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:24.360]  the mainstream media were now showing her picture which they didn't
[03:19:24.360 --> 03:19:28.520]  for at least two days in fact three days they refused to show
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:32.760]  her face whatsoever but now they're complaining about it
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:37.240]  melissa harris perry on msnbc is saying that the
[03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:41.560]  the jihadists might have had their feelings hurt by the fact that the new
[03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:46.920]  york times published the photo of the woman partly responsible for the
[03:19:46.920 --> 03:19:49.880]  massacre in san bernardino stay tuned we're going to play the clip

[03:23:00.680 --> 03:23:05.240]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war
[03:23:05.240 --> 03:23:08.600]  each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better

[03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:25.880]  the standard answers are firewood, coal or propane but the problem with that if

[03:23:29.640 --> 03:23:33.480]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke

[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:46.200]  now before the break i mentioned this clip which we're going to go to
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:53.240]  Melissa Harris Perry says the New York Times was wrong to show the face
[03:24:53.240 --> 03:24:57.640]  of the San Bernardino terrorist is the clip
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:24:59.880]  and then all of a sudden we find out they're Muslim
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:02.920]  bam gun violence is out of the question we start talking about
[03:25:02.920 --> 03:25:06.840]  terrorism and i'm extremely disturbed i mean i looked at the New York Times cover
[03:25:06.840 --> 03:25:10.600]  today here you have a whole op-ed on gun control great
[03:25:10.600 --> 03:25:14.360]  right next to it is pictures from the apartment of things that i have in my
[03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:18.440]  house yes like these are things that all Muslims have in their house there's
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:21.640]  nothing about that that tells you a story about
[03:25:21.640 --> 03:25:24.440]  what terrors have looked like so you're telling me that well my friends who are
[03:25:24.440 --> 03:25:29.000]  not Muslim come into my home and see see a Quran or see frames on the wall with
[03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:32.440]  a scripture from my from my religion that is that supposed to tell you
[03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:35.160]  something i mean it's absolutely outrageous we would never do that to
[03:25:35.160 --> 03:25:38.760]  anyone and we didn't do that to dear we didn't do that to roof
[03:25:38.760 --> 03:25:41.880]  i'm i'm tired of the double standards of how we treat Muslims they are the
[03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:44.600]  perfect that image and then also right next to it
[03:25:44.600 --> 03:25:47.880]  an image of the shooting suspect there in
[03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:50.920]  in his job and that idea that like okay this is what
[03:25:50.920 --> 03:25:55.320]  terrorism looks like for me that that is a difference
[03:25:55.320 --> 03:25:59.720]  and it is a material and meaningful difference
[03:25:59.720 --> 03:26:04.360]  they have it Melissa Harris Perry saying that the New York Times publishing the
[03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:09.240]  photo of the terrorist the woman who helped Farouk shoot dead what was it
[03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:16.200]  14 people in San Bernardino that that was wrong insensitive and offensive to
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:20.520]  Muslims merely showing a picture of the terrorist this is the same
[03:26:20.520 --> 03:26:23.560]  woman who says that your children belong to the state
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:27.080]  the same woman who wears tampon earrings on her show
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:31.640]  and again she's come out with absolute lunacy saying that it boo her it might
[03:26:31.640 --> 03:26:34.440]  offend the feelings of the poor she had is
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:37.640]  because the New York Times dared to publish this photo
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:41.720]  when in fact the mainstream media waited days before even showing the face of
[03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:45.560]  this woman again people were speculating that that could be
[03:26:45.560 --> 03:26:49.160]  because they didn't want to show her without her full face covering because
[03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:52.840]  it might upset the feelings of the poor jihadists again the
[03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:56.840]  special snowflakes that we should censor our own media
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:01.000]  to cater for as i mentioned before the break Melissa Harris Perry
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:04.280]  was not the only one who was upset about the media
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:10.440]  publishing this photograph Hashim Said of Al Jazeera said in a tweet
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:14.520]  it's disrespectful again to publish the photo of the terrorist
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:19.000]  is disrespectful disrespectful to who other terrorists
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:22.680]  i mean a white people supposed to be all but her and offended
[03:27:22.680 --> 03:27:26.040]  if they publish a picture of dylan roof for god's sake
[03:27:26.040 --> 03:27:29.880]  he said it's offensive if she was wearing a burqa that covers her face
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:35.080]  it's disrespectful to show a picture without so he's claiming that just
[03:27:35.080 --> 03:27:40.280]  because normally she wore a full face burqa because they had this image
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:44.040]  which showed the entirety of her face that was offensive it hurt the feelings
[03:27:44.040 --> 03:27:47.640]  of the poor jihadists so it was wrong to do that and
[03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:51.960]  then of course we had Linda Starzy of the New York Daily News
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:58.360]  publishing a vitriolic hate filled article blaming the victim of the attack
[03:27:58.360 --> 03:28:03.240]  for provoking the shooting blaming this messianic christian
[03:28:03.240 --> 03:28:07.320]  Jew who had god forbid arguments with Farouk the
[03:28:07.320 --> 03:28:12.200]  shooter about religion about politics before the shooting
[03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:17.000]  she basically implied that he was equally responsible for the massacre as the
[03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:21.000]  actual gunman quote they were too hate filled bigoted
[03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:24.440]  municipal employees interacting in one department
[03:28:24.440 --> 03:28:28.440]  now 13 innocent people are dead in unspeakable carnage
[03:28:28.440 --> 03:28:32.280]  so she actually piles him in with Farouk like he's
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:36.520]  the culprit he's responsible for all the innocent people that died
[03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:40.920]  simply because he was against ISIS he was a conservative
[03:28:40.920 --> 03:28:44.920]  he supported the nra he disliked planned parenthood
[03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:49.640]  and because of that even though he was brutally gunned down dead
[03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:53.800]  according to this sick new york daily news columnist
[03:28:53.800 --> 03:28:58.760]  he's equally to blame for the massacre this is how the left reacts
[03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:02.760]  i mean imagine if somebody on the right imagine if Ann Coulter
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:06.520]  or Bill O'Reilly had come out and blamed the victims
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:10.680]  the black churchgoers the victims of the dylan roof massacre
[03:29:10.680 --> 03:29:15.080]  for the massacre which killed them because they said something political
[03:29:15.080 --> 03:29:20.120]  a few days before imagine the outrage on the left if that happened
[03:29:20.120 --> 03:29:25.560]  yet somebody on the left a regressive leftist who is not a real liberal says
[03:29:25.560 --> 03:29:28.680]  it and you know it's move along nothing to see
[03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:32.200]  here so again absolutely outrageous comments and again
[03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:37.160]  Melissa Harris Perry of MSNBC saying that it was offensive to publish the
[03:29:37.160 --> 03:29:40.040]  photo of the terrorist absolutely astounding
[03:29:40.040 --> 03:29:43.640]  we'll be back with more news and your calls on the fourth hour overdrive of
[03:29:43.640 --> 03:29:50.360]  the alex joneshow stay tuned info wars dot com we're on the march the empires on
[03:29:50.360 --> 03:29:59.560]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:03.400]  did you know that when you're serving jury duty you have complete authority
[03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:06.920]  over the law in the power to stop the government that's right as a juror you
[03:30:06.920 --> 03:30:10.120]  can not only judge the defendant but also the law he's being charged with as
[03:30:10.120 --> 03:30:12.520]  well that's a little known secret prosecutors don't
[03:30:12.520 --> 03:30:15.560]  want you to know for example let's say a man is charged with marijuana
[03:30:15.560 --> 03:30:18.920]  possession and you don't agree with that law well as a juror you can decline
[03:30:18.920 --> 03:30:21.720]  charging the man because you don't believe the law is justified
[03:30:21.720 --> 03:30:24.920]  judges and prosecutors have misled juries and to believe in that they should
[03:30:24.920 --> 03:30:28.360]  only examine the facts of the case and not the law but the juror can actually
[03:30:28.360 --> 03:30:31.320]  stop the enforcement of unconstitutional laws in two ways

[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:34.200]  forson and of course obama gave his big speech last
[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:37.800]  night in which he said that farouk the sanbernadino
[03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:43.400]  killer wasn't following a per was following a perverted interpretation
[03:33:43.400 --> 03:33:47.800]  of islam that's how obama framed it as if
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:53.640]  the quran contained no directions to violence whatsoever which of course
[03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:57.400]  we know that it does we've had this whole cloud of political correctness in the
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:01.800]  aftermath of the sanbernadino shooting we've had liberals try to
[03:34:01.800 --> 03:34:07.000]  make the justification that maybe farouk carried out the rampage because
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:12.200]  he was offended by the christmas party maybe he was offended
[03:34:12.200 --> 03:34:15.640]  because they made fun of his beard these are some of the
[03:34:15.640 --> 03:34:19.800]  ridiculous speculations that been trotted out in the
[03:34:19.800 --> 03:34:23.640]  aftermath of this shooting when of course we know where he
[03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:27.720]  derives his motivation from it's not hard to guess when it happens
[03:34:27.720 --> 03:34:32.120]  over and over again when isis itself cites
[03:34:32.120 --> 03:34:36.200]  passages in the quran says that they attacked people in paris because they
[03:34:36.200 --> 03:34:39.560]  brought corruption upon the earth again following
[03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:44.680]  directly the commandments of muhammad from the quran
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:48.520]  but obama says basically islam is a religion of peace
[03:34:48.520 --> 03:34:52.520]  and that it's nothing to do with the quran that farouk was following a
[03:34:52.520 --> 03:34:56.120]  perverted interpretation of islam well this video
[03:34:56.120 --> 03:35:01.240]  just went up on info wars dot com about an hour ago and we're going to premiere
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:04.920]  the clip now on the alex germ show islam is not
[03:35:04.920 --> 03:35:11.000]  a religion of peace here's the clip islam is not a religion of peace
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:16.200]  anyone who still claims this in 2015 is either stupid or they're a liar
[03:35:16.200 --> 03:35:20.040]  every time i say that islam is not a religion of peace
[03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:24.760]  i get death threats from muslims how dare you say that islam is violent
[03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:28.600]  we're going to prove you wrong by violently killing you
[03:35:28.600 --> 03:35:32.440]  at least 10 muslim countries impose the death penalty
[03:35:32.440 --> 03:35:37.240]  for apostasy they execute people for saying they're no longer muslims
[03:35:37.240 --> 03:35:41.640]  polls show that the majority of muslims support killing people for saying
[03:35:41.640 --> 03:35:45.960]  they're no longer muslim executing people for not believing the same thing as
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:49.880]  you is violent and wrong it's not peaceful
[03:35:49.880 --> 03:35:53.640]  because it's the only religion that acts like the mafia
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:57.560]  that will kill you if you say the wrong thing
[03:35:57.560 --> 03:36:01.800]  draw the wrong picture or write the wrong book at least 10 muslim countries
[03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:06.120]  impose the death penalty for homosexuality they execute people for
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:10.040]  their sexual preference polls show that the majority of muslims are
[03:36:10.040 --> 03:36:15.240]  completely intolerant of homosexuality executing people for being gay
[03:36:15.240 --> 03:36:20.760]  is violent and wrong it's not peaceful at least 11 muslim
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:23.400]  countries or ruling tribes in those countries
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:26.920]  stone women to death they stone women to death
[03:36:26.920 --> 03:36:30.600]  for allegedly committing adultery rape victims
[03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:35.240]  are also stoned to death polls show that the majority of muslims in these
[03:36:35.240 --> 03:36:39.160]  countries support stoning women to death for adultery
[03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:43.320]  stoning women to death for committing adultery or being raped
[03:36:43.320 --> 03:36:47.000]  is violent and wrong it's not peaceful
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:50.920]  whenever muslims carry out terror attacks they cite the quran
[03:36:50.920 --> 03:36:55.080]  as justification the quran contains a plethora of passengers
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:59.080]  that directly encourage muslims to kill non-muslims
[03:36:59.080 --> 03:37:02.680]  i'll leave a list in the description note that there isn't
[03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:08.200]  a quran 2 which is only read by radicals or extremists
[03:37:08.200 --> 03:37:11.960]  there's only one quran in which acts of violence
[03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:15.400]  are specifically encouraged although a minority
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:18.680]  a disturbing number of muslims support terror attacks
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:24.840]  for example 39 in afghanistan and 29 in egypt killing innocent people
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:29.080]  in terror attacks is violent and wrong it's not
[03:37:29.080 --> 03:37:33.320]  peaceful but there's over a billion muslims who would never commit terror
[03:37:33.320 --> 03:37:37.320]  kill gay people stone women to death or execute apostates
[03:37:37.320 --> 03:37:40.360]  right but they subscribe to a belief system
[03:37:40.360 --> 03:37:44.360]  which advocates all of those things and carries them out
[03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:49.720]  so they have two choices either continue to advocate all those violent things
[03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:55.160]  or acknowledge that islam is violent and not a religion of peace
[03:37:55.160 --> 03:38:00.200]  and agree that islam is in dire need of a reformation but most victims of terror
[03:38:00.200 --> 03:38:04.760]  attacks are muslims right so they have two choices either
[03:38:04.760 --> 03:38:09.960]  continue to deny that islam is violent and keep being killed in terror attacks
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:14.680]  or acknowledge that islam is violent and not a religion of peace
[03:38:14.680 --> 03:38:18.360]  and agree that islam is in dire need of a reformation
[03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:23.320]  saying most victims of terror are muslims is not an argument
[03:38:23.320 --> 03:38:27.320]  but what about the crusades remember that during the crusades and the
[03:38:27.320 --> 03:38:30.200]  inquisition people committed terrible deeds in the
[03:38:30.200 --> 03:38:33.400]  name of christ the fact that christians fought against muslims
[03:38:33.400 --> 03:38:37.000]  in a military campaign nearly a thousand years ago
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:40.280]  does not excuse the fact that muslim countries
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:45.000]  in 2015 kill gay people stone women to death
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:49.080]  and execute muslims who give up on the faith of islam saying
[03:38:49.080 --> 03:38:52.840]  but what about the crusades is not an argument
[03:38:52.840 --> 03:38:57.240]  but what about western foreign policy the fact that western military forces have
[03:38:57.240 --> 03:39:01.000]  launched unprovoked acts of regime change in the middle east
[03:39:01.000 --> 03:39:05.080]  is terrible and i've been a vocal critic of those wars
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:10.120]  for the entirety of my adult life history has proven that such wars only
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:14.120]  empower violent jihadists but that doesn't excuse muslim
[03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:19.080]  countries in 2015 killing gay people stoning women to death
[03:39:19.080 --> 03:39:23.560]  and executing those who give up on the faith of islam western foreign policy
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:27.640]  has had no effect on laws derived from the caran
[03:39:27.640 --> 03:39:32.680]  in countries like pakistan and saudi arabia which impose the death penalty
[03:39:32.680 --> 03:39:37.560]  for these supposed crimes saying but what about western foreign policy
[03:39:37.560 --> 03:39:41.480]  is not an argument but what about violent passages
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:46.280]  in the old testament unlike islamic countries there are virtually no
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:50.520]  christian nations besides uganda that kill gay people
[03:39:50.520 --> 03:39:55.240]  execute apostates and stone women to death that's because christianity had a
[03:39:55.240 --> 03:39:59.960]  reformation in the 1500s which purged it of its most
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:03.960]  intolerant and violent aspects islam hasn't had a
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:08.200]  reformation that's why it's still intolerant and violent
[03:40:08.200 --> 03:40:11.400]  pointing to intolerant passages in the old testament
[03:40:11.400 --> 03:40:15.240]  which no one has acted on for hundreds of years
[03:40:15.240 --> 03:40:20.840]  is not an argument saying but what about violent passages in the old testament
[03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:24.920]  is not an argument how do we move towards reforming
[03:40:24.920 --> 03:40:28.600]  islam well first we don't shout down the voices of reform
[03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:34.040]  by calling the bigots apostates and islamophobes we don't automatically
[03:40:34.040 --> 03:40:38.840]  denounce anyone who criticizes the violent and intolerant parts of the
[03:40:38.840 --> 03:40:45.560]  koran as a racist islam is not a race and we don't excuse or
[03:40:45.560 --> 03:40:49.400]  hide the fact that islam is violent by redundantly citing
[03:40:49.400 --> 03:40:53.640]  an array of supposed justifications which are completely
[03:40:53.640 --> 03:40:58.520]  unrelated so i welcome your comments but here's a challenge
[03:40:58.520 --> 03:41:02.200]  try to rebut my argument without using the words
[03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:08.760]  bigot racist or islamophob try to directly address my argument
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:13.400]  without citing the crusades western foreign policy
[03:41:13.400 --> 03:41:19.160]  or passages in the old testament none of those things disprove that islam
[03:41:19.160 --> 03:41:23.000]  is a violent and intolerant belief system also
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:27.160]  claiming i'm a zionist chill a crypto Jew
[03:41:27.160 --> 03:41:33.640]  or a christian fundamentalist with no proof is not an argument and again
[03:41:33.640 --> 03:41:40.440]  islam is not a race it's an ideology it's gross it's racist it's not
[03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:45.720]  saying it's racist to criticize islam is like saying it's racist to criticize
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:53.160]  socialism or atheism that's not an argument islam is not a religion
[03:41:53.160 --> 03:41:57.480]  of peace but i challenge you to prove me wrong
[03:41:57.480 --> 03:42:01.640]  but please just try and lay off the death threats
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:07.880]  because that's not an argument okay they have it video islam is not religion
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:11.160]  of peace get that out share it around it's
[03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:14.520]  it could go viral by the looks of it but across the challenge i made in the
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:18.360]  video is rebut my argument that islam is
[03:42:18.360 --> 03:42:21.640]  not religion of peace without calling me a bigot
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:25.160]  an islamophobe or a racist because islam is not a race
[03:42:25.160 --> 03:42:28.280]  without referring to the crusades a military campaign where
[03:42:28.280 --> 03:42:31.240]  christians fought muslims nearly a thousand years ago
[03:42:31.240 --> 03:42:35.080]  without referring to u.s foreign policy which has no effect whatsoever on
[03:42:35.080 --> 03:42:39.080]  countries like Saudi Arabia who make laws that lead to women being stoned and
[03:42:39.080 --> 03:42:42.360]  gays being beheaded try and rebut my argument without
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:46.200]  referring to any of those things try and rebut my argument without referring to
[03:42:46.200 --> 03:42:50.280]  passages in the old testament which aren't even relevant anymore because
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:53.800]  nobody's acted on them for 500 years or more
[03:42:53.800 --> 03:42:57.320]  there was a christian reformation in the 16th century
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:01.480]  there hasn't been a reformation of islam to purge it
[03:43:01.480 --> 03:43:04.840]  of its intolerant and violent aspects which is why
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:09.640]  these terrorists still cite the quran when they carry out these attacks
[03:43:09.640 --> 03:43:13.720]  and of course you can't really call yourself a quote moderate muslim
[03:43:13.720 --> 03:43:19.720]  if you still believe in stoning women and executing gay people
[03:43:19.720 --> 03:43:23.400]  so again we need muslims from within the faith
[03:43:23.400 --> 03:43:28.360]  to lead this march to reform islam which some of them are to be fair and people
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:31.960]  ex-muslims who have left they're the ones on the front lines people like
[03:43:31.960 --> 03:43:36.520]  ayan hercialli trying to reform islam and of course being
[03:43:36.520 --> 03:43:40.920]  shouted down at every single point by both islamists
[03:43:40.920 --> 03:43:46.120]  and the left who have made this alliance of intolerance
[03:43:46.120 --> 03:43:50.200]  and they're perfectly fine with gays being beheaded women being stoned to
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:53.880]  death because they never criticize it and they never get to the root of it
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:58.920]  which is islam itself and the quran so get that video
[03:43:58.920 --> 03:44:02.280]  share it out and we can try and reach some people of course
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:06.760]  i say try and rebut my argument without calling me a racist a bigger or an
[03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:10.440]  islamophobe all the comments on youtube negative
[03:44:10.440 --> 03:44:14.680]  ones anyway are calling me a racist a bigger and an islamophobe so
[03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:19.800]  they've completely failed or they've not bothered to watch the actual video
[03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:22.760]  i'm going to go to some of your calls in a minute but i wanted to cover this
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:25.720]  story of course on saturday night we had a knife
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:29.160]  wielding jihadist in an underground station in
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:33.080]  london who slashed someone's neck nearly killed them
[03:44:33.080 --> 03:44:39.160]  while chanting out this is for syria new york daily news reports knife
[03:44:39.160 --> 03:44:43.880]  wielding london terrorists had isis images paris attack photos on his phone
[03:44:43.880 --> 03:44:46.920]  but again nothing to do with the religion of peace
[03:44:46.920 --> 03:44:50.840]  obviously in fact we had people in on the news saying this might be just
[03:44:50.840 --> 03:44:54.120]  mental illness he's shouting out this is for syria
[03:44:54.120 --> 03:44:58.600]  in other words this is for isis who the uk is now bombing in syria
[03:44:58.600 --> 03:45:03.160]  he's got photos of isis on his phone he's got photos of the paris massacre on his
[03:45:03.160 --> 03:45:07.400]  phone but again nothing to do with islam the knife wielding
[03:45:07.400 --> 03:45:10.920]  not accused of terrorizing a london underground station over the weekend
[03:45:10.920 --> 03:45:14.920]  kept images of isis and its attacks on his phone prosecutors said
[03:45:14.920 --> 03:45:19.400]  monday suspected terrorist muradin mayer 29 was
[03:45:19.400 --> 03:45:22.600]  hauled to west minster magistrates caught in a police van to face an
[03:45:22.600 --> 03:45:28.040]  attempted murder charge for his attack so you had this guy slashing people's
[03:45:28.040 --> 03:45:32.440]  throats in the underground it was all caught on camera
[03:45:32.440 --> 03:45:38.760]  and how did the cock-holded british left respond within hours
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:44.920]  with a hashtag you ain't no muslim brov because one of the people filming this
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:50.440]  jihadist carrying out his attack said the words you ain't no muslim brov
[03:45:50.440 --> 03:45:56.200]  in an attempt in an attempt to detach his actions his violent actions from the
[03:45:56.200 --> 03:45:59.080]  religion of islam and then of course the politically
[03:45:59.080 --> 03:46:04.840]  corrupt obsessed left jumped on this it started trending on twitter
[03:46:04.840 --> 03:46:09.320]  and it made everybody feel a little bit better because now we don't have to
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:12.840]  blame it on islam because it's the religion of peace even
[03:46:12.840 --> 03:46:16.440]  though it's clearly not but you know so long as everybody
[03:46:16.440 --> 03:46:20.440]  was able to virtue signal and earn social brownie points with all their
[03:46:20.440 --> 03:46:23.560]  trendy friends and it was all okay everybody felt a bit
[03:46:23.560 --> 03:46:27.240]  better but again someone made the point on twitter after this hashtag
[03:46:27.240 --> 03:46:32.520]  you ain't no muslim brov was trending the bar has been set so low that a
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:37.240]  muslim who's not in favor of random stabbings is hailed as a hero
[03:46:37.240 --> 03:46:40.680]  and that says it all because the guy obviously saying this
[03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:45.560]  was a muslim too but as pat kandel points out
[03:46:45.560 --> 03:46:50.280]  are we sure you ain't no muslim brov was directed at the attacker
[03:46:50.280 --> 03:46:53.800]  and not at the bearded cop holding him down
[03:46:53.800 --> 03:46:57.400]  because of course one of the police officers who apprehended this terrorist
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:01.960]  who was black was muslim quite clearly
[03:47:01.960 --> 03:47:04.840]  so the guy who said you ain't no muslim brov
[03:47:04.840 --> 03:47:09.720]  could have been talking about the cop who apprehended the terrorist
[03:47:09.720 --> 03:47:12.760]  he might not have even been addressing his comment
[03:47:12.760 --> 03:47:17.080]  to the terrorist so if that turns out to be the case
[03:47:17.080 --> 03:47:23.080]  it's going to be a spectacular defeat for the narrative of the leftists and the
[03:47:23.080 --> 03:47:27.320]  regressive left those obsessed with political correctness
[03:47:27.320 --> 03:47:30.680]  because they obviously they tried to claim this to point out that
[03:47:30.680 --> 03:47:34.280]  this attack of this jihadists they tried to divorce his
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:38.120]  acts his violent actions from the religion of islam
[03:47:38.120 --> 03:47:41.080]  and that was the entire narrative in the day after the attack
[03:47:41.080 --> 03:47:46.440]  it could blow up spectacularly if that proves to be the case
[03:47:46.440 --> 03:47:49.480]  but now he's in court so we'll continue to follow that story
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:53.640]  let's go to one of these callers uh darryl in texas you're on the air go ahead
[03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:56.280]  darryl
[03:47:56.280 --> 03:48:02.600]  hello how are you good darryl all sunny mind today well um those are good points
[03:48:02.600 --> 03:48:08.440]  uh you're making i wanted to uh also make a comment on the fact that
[03:48:08.440 --> 03:48:11.640]  you know if someone is getting offended that
[03:48:11.640 --> 03:48:17.720]  her face is being shown why aren't they directing their outrage towards her
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:20.920]  because she if she didn't wear a face shown she shouldn't have done that and
[03:48:20.920 --> 03:48:26.680]  it's like um if we have a kkk member and someone out to them by
[03:48:26.680 --> 03:48:30.520]  showing their face in the newspaper we're not worried that they offended the
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:34.520]  kkk members so everyone should be directing their
[03:48:34.520 --> 03:48:39.800]  outrage towards her for sort of making a making a breach of
[03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:43.800]  islam by by you know forcing the media to show her
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:47.480]  face i mean the outrage should be directed towards her
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:52.520]  um and uh i also wanted to make a comment about the
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:57.080]  the christmas lighting uh ceremony from one understand the governor of
[03:48:57.080 --> 03:49:00.920]  california canceled the christmas lighting ceremony
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:05.400]  and this is not the way you you fight this type of thing
[03:49:05.400 --> 03:49:08.840]  you do the exact opposite what you do is you say
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:12.280]  if the christmas tree offended the person then let's put a christmas tree on
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:15.880]  every corner and then you say something
[03:49:15.880 --> 03:49:19.480]  and there's i'm gonna say three words that
[03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:22.840]  that uh i think are going to have to be said sooner or later because you can
[03:49:22.840 --> 03:49:27.560]  tell people no you can tell congress no you can tell
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:32.120]  um the law supposed lawmakers you can tell them no all you want to people
[03:49:32.120 --> 03:49:36.680]  that are violating your rights and assaulting you you can be nice to them
[03:49:36.680 --> 03:49:41.000]  and you can tell them no but eventually you have to draw a lot draw a line in
[03:49:41.000 --> 03:49:43.960]  the sand you have to look them in the eyes and say three words and those
[03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:50.360]  words are make your move so that is that point
[03:49:50.360 --> 03:49:53.800]  is when you give no more and you say no
[03:49:53.800 --> 03:49:57.000]  and you mean it and so they should put a christmas tree on every corner and
[03:49:57.000 --> 03:50:01.160]  simply say make your move okay darryl thanks for the call i
[03:50:01.160 --> 03:50:04.600]  vehemently agree with that and of course the kind of attitude that you're
[03:50:04.600 --> 03:50:07.720]  talking about is the same kind of attitude that we saw after the charlie
[03:50:07.720 --> 03:50:13.400]  hebdo attack in paris back in january which is segments of the left which
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:19.400]  again are allied with islamists blamed the cartoonists for the massacre
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:23.880]  they said they were provoking the poor jihadists who had their
[03:50:23.880 --> 03:50:27.480]  special snowflake sensitive feelings hurt
[03:50:27.480 --> 03:50:33.080]  and that in some way justified the brutal massacre of those cartoonists we
[03:50:33.080 --> 03:50:36.760]  saw the same rhetoric after the garland attack which was
[03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:41.480]  thankfully stopped because of armed responsible men with weapons
[03:50:41.480 --> 03:50:43.960]  unfortunately none of the victims in san

[03:54:55.240 --> 03:54:59.240]  up on weapons after California shooting
[03:54:59.240 --> 03:55:02.760]  market watch this just broke gun stocks rally after
[03:55:02.760 --> 03:55:06.760]  Obama's prime time address on terrorism shares of the two publicly
[03:55:06.760 --> 03:55:10.920]  traded gun makers rallied on Monday a day after president Barack Obama gave a
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:14.680]  prime time address calling for a modest reduction in the availability
[03:55:14.680 --> 03:55:20.040]  of firearms of course he's calling for the TSA no fly list to be linked to a no
[03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:24.520]  gun by list which ironically will create a list of
[03:55:24.520 --> 03:55:28.600]  Muslims just as Donald Trump was criticized for calling for
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:33.320]  it will create a surveillance list mainly comprised of Muslims because they
[03:55:33.320 --> 03:55:37.320]  make up a significant portion of the TSA no fly list so
[03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:41.560]  Obama can call for it it's trendy if Trump calls for it in a different
[03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:45.800]  context it's racist and islamophobic let's go
[03:55:45.800 --> 03:55:51.720]  to one more call here Kevin in California you're on the air go ahead Kevin
[03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:55.480]  uh yeah thanks paul uh good to see good to hear from you
[03:55:55.480 --> 03:55:59.480]  um yeah i've been trying to call so many times i'm glad to finally get through
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:03.640]  but uh i wanted you know playing the drum a little more on the subject uh with
[03:56:03.640 --> 03:56:07.640]  you know the christmas party out uh band it's
[03:56:07.640 --> 03:56:12.200]  it's ridiculous and one it's it's completely anti-american um this
[03:56:12.200 --> 03:56:14.840]  country was founded with the courtings cornerstone
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:20.040]  of the basis of religious freedom and the the ability to express it
[03:56:20.040 --> 03:56:23.560]  you know with the right and left hand being you know the right to defend
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:27.640]  ourselves equally to whoever might press us you know revising it for modern
[03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:31.640]  day and of course um our right arm of freedom
[03:56:31.640 --> 03:56:35.480]  speech to defend ourselves basically to defend our religious freedom it's
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:41.640]  really almost like the the the keystone to our entire
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:45.960]  declaration and i think it's time this is kind of like one of those last
[03:56:45.960 --> 03:56:49.480]  straw issues i think everybody should be upset about this
[03:56:49.480 --> 03:56:54.760]  i think anybody who openly says that we should restrict our religious freedoms
[03:56:54.760 --> 03:57:00.440]  needs to be prosecuted i think i don't know what do you think
[03:57:00.440 --> 03:57:03.320]  well i fully agree and it's it's this idea that
[03:57:03.320 --> 03:57:06.920]  we've got to be tolerant of all these foreign cultures that are coming in
[03:57:06.920 --> 03:57:11.000]  which we have been completely tolerant yet when it comes to americans for
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:14.680]  example at universities having christmas cards
[03:57:14.680 --> 03:57:19.400]  just having sending christmas cards taking mistletoe to a christmas party
[03:57:19.400 --> 03:57:24.440]  even the decor being red and green top universities across america are now
[03:57:24.440 --> 03:57:27.560]  sending out advisories saying that that's not politically
[03:57:27.560 --> 03:57:31.240]  correct that might upset someone of a different faith
[03:57:31.240 --> 03:57:35.240]  so it all has to be this generic holiday party
[03:57:35.240 --> 03:57:40.040]  bs so again we have to accept this invading culture which in many cases is
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:43.640]  completely intolerant and anti-american
[03:57:43.640 --> 03:57:48.200]  yeah americans can't go to christmas parties can barely even say the word
[03:57:48.200 --> 03:57:51.560]  merry christmas can't exchange christmas cards
[03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:56.120]  can't have you know red and green decor is completely ludicrous
[03:57:56.120 --> 03:57:59.320]  and again we have this whole islamophobia meme which obama harped on
[03:57:59.320 --> 03:58:04.360]  about last night if you look at the stats only 16 percent of hate crime attacks
[03:58:04.360 --> 03:58:09.560]  in the u.s are against muslim 55 percent are against jews
[03:58:09.560 --> 03:58:13.080]  so when they bring in this meme of islamophobia to try and shut down
[03:58:13.080 --> 03:58:17.160]  dissent criticism of the refugee program for example
[03:58:17.160 --> 03:58:21.800]  it's completely fraudulent that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour of the
[03:58:21.800 --> 03:58:25.000]  alex juncture and then go to the info wars store to get all the
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:30.600]  products support the platform and get that video out islam is not a religion
