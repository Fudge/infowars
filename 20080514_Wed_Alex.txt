[00:00.000 --> 00:07.900]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.900 --> 00:32.020]  GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. We only have one
[00:32.020 --> 00:35.500]  guest today because I want to have plenty of time to cover the news and have
[00:35.500 --> 00:41.420]  open phones in the first, third, and fourth hour today. Pastor David J. Smith
[00:41.420 --> 00:46.380]  from Loxahatchee, Texas fighting the New World Order for more than 30 years will
[00:46.380 --> 00:52.740]  be joining us on air to talk about his neck of the woods nearby the Baptist
[00:52.740 --> 00:59.380]  Bible School in East Texas where they have Homeland Security come in and tell
[00:59.380 --> 01:03.620]  members of the staff that they'll be arrested and charged with espionage if
[01:03.620 --> 01:09.260]  they speak about the Bill of Rights and Constitution. Now of course we have video
[01:09.260 --> 01:13.580]  of FEMA training police. We have their training manuals, FBI training manuals,
[01:13.580 --> 01:18.220]  flyers, squad car video of them pulling a woman over and finding a pocket
[01:18.220 --> 01:21.420]  Constitution and the police have a discussion and say it's illegal, arrest
[01:21.420 --> 01:25.940]  is made, can't have a Constitution. If you're a new listener this is not a joke,
[01:25.940 --> 01:32.980]  okay? I'm not joking. This is really going on. This is how serious things are. So
[01:32.980 --> 01:39.940]  he'll be joining us coming up. As I told you, I plan to have all the real icons,
[01:39.940 --> 01:42.540]  the people who've been fighting for decades and decades against the New
[01:42.540 --> 01:45.260]  World Order on this show. They've all been on before but many of them haven't
[01:45.260 --> 01:49.060]  been on in years. In fact, I just remembered again to tell, try to try to
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.100]  get Red Beckman on if his health allows. Haven't had him on in a few years and
[01:53.100 --> 01:58.700]  he's a World War II vet. He really is one of the great granddaddies of them all.
[01:58.700 --> 02:05.500]  Now, big show today, a lot of news, a lot of information, we'll cover a bunch of it
[02:05.500 --> 02:11.340]  after this first break. But before I do that on this 14th of May, 2008 edition,
[02:11.340 --> 02:17.660]  I was listening to Derry Brownfield as I was driving into work this morning and
[02:17.660 --> 02:25.420]  then here in the office on local radio station 90.1 and I was not 90.1, he's on
[02:25.420 --> 02:33.180]  96.3, excuse me. I was listening to Derry Brownfield and just the things he was
[02:33.180 --> 02:38.700]  saying, I already knew everything he was saying but it hit me anew. I had fresh
[02:38.700 --> 02:42.620]  outrage because I was aware of the information he was covering and then
[02:42.620 --> 02:47.900]  even more. I'm not misinterpreting, I'm not saying I know more than he does, it's
[02:47.900 --> 02:52.180]  not about that. I mean, there's so much data and obviously he has more data too.
[02:52.180 --> 02:58.820]  It's so bad that you can't even explain it to people. You can't even put forward
[02:58.820 --> 03:02.980]  how truly bad it is. We're going to invite Derry on the show here in the next
[03:02.980 --> 03:09.140]  week or two. I hope he can join us because it's multifaceted. Derry Brownfield
[03:09.140 --> 03:15.980]  criticized Monsanto. He is on his 70 or so affiliates. Most of them are in
[03:15.980 --> 03:22.300]  Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, right there in the breadbasket of
[03:22.300 --> 03:26.540]  the country. He's been on the air doing farm reports for, I don't know, 30, 40
[03:26.540 --> 03:31.500]  years but he's had a syndicated radio show since the 80s fighting the New World
[03:31.500 --> 03:37.100]  Order and they told him at Learfield Communications he previously owned part
[03:37.100 --> 03:42.220]  of Learfield when he founded it back in the 60s. He sold out to Learfield in
[03:42.220 --> 03:48.900]  the late 80s. He said, they told him, they said Monsanto has said shut up and
[03:48.900 --> 03:52.460]  don't talk about him. They're one of our big sponsors, not just with Brownfield
[03:52.460 --> 03:57.860]  but the entire Learfield. A bunch of other shows, farm reports, news reports,
[03:57.860 --> 04:03.860]  and so Derry has had to leave Learfield and he is leaving at the end of the
[04:03.860 --> 04:07.820]  month and he's going to come to Genesis, come to the GCN radio network that always
[04:07.820 --> 04:11.300]  has carried his show. I don't know, for like 10 years we've put it out on some of
[04:11.300 --> 04:14.100]  the satellite feeds we've got and he comes on right before me on the network
[04:14.100 --> 04:18.420]  feed, on the internet, M&FM, Choraway, the rest of it. But now he's going to be
[04:18.420 --> 04:22.980]  produced by Genesis. We're very, very excited about that and we ask, of course,
[04:22.980 --> 04:28.820]  that all his affiliates continue carrying him. We know that many of the stations
[04:28.820 --> 04:34.380]  that carry my show also carry Derry Brownfield but that's not the main issue
[04:34.380 --> 04:37.220]  of why I'm bringing up Derry Brownfield. I want to talk about what he was talking
[04:37.220 --> 04:43.020]  about today on the other side and then I'm going to get into a ton of vital
[04:43.020 --> 04:47.020]  news and information. This is the GCN radio network. Stay with us.
[04:47.020 --> 05:03.020]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.020 --> 05:09.020]  It's known as the Bilderberg group. Is that their objective, the world domination?
[05:09.020 --> 05:13.820]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the
[05:13.820 --> 05:21.020]  New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:21.020 --> 05:27.020]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:27.020 --> 05:31.020]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:31.020 --> 05:34.020]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[05:34.020 --> 05:37.020]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[05:37.020 --> 05:39.020]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[05:48.020 --> 05:53.020]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[05:53.020 --> 05:57.020]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[05:57.020 --> 06:01.020]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers
[06:01.020 --> 06:04.020]  than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[06:04.020 --> 06:07.020]  when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[06:07.020 --> 06:11.020]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[06:11.020 --> 06:15.020]  and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron
[06:15.020 --> 06:19.020]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[06:19.020 --> 06:23.020]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[06:23.020 --> 06:27.020]  for one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities
[06:27.020 --> 06:31.020]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[06:31.020 --> 06:34.020]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally

[06:52.020 --> 06:55.020]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[06:55.020 --> 06:58.020]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media
[06:58.020 --> 07:01.020]  to inform you of what is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world
[07:01.020 --> 07:05.020]  in the last 50 years. For the last three years, the earth has consumed more food
[07:05.020 --> 07:08.020]  than it has been able to produce and it has now finally caught up with this.
[07:08.020 --> 07:12.020]  In the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice are already being rationed
[07:12.020 --> 07:15.020]  and the next rice crop won't be available for another four to five months.
[07:15.020 --> 07:18.020]  It's fall in the Southern Hemisphere and many countries are short the food
[07:18.020 --> 07:22.020]  necessary to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[07:22.020 --> 07:26.020]  Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country
[07:26.020 --> 07:30.020]  and are now rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[07:30.020 --> 07:33.020]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in
[07:33.020 --> 07:36.020]  and control food and food exports under martial law.
[07:36.020 --> 07:41.020]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202.

[07:53.020 --> 07:57.020]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[07:57.020 --> 08:01.020]  The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[08:01.020 --> 08:16.020]  Every major airport in the United States is getting body scanners
[08:16.020 --> 08:21.020]  where they put you into a chamber that 360 scans your entire biometric layout
[08:21.020 --> 08:26.020]  of your body and gives them a full color image of your neck and body in 3D.
[08:26.020 --> 08:32.020]  Of course, first they put it in five airports, then 20 airports, then 50 airports,
[08:32.020 --> 08:37.020]  and now 200 plus all the major airports being announced by the Associated Press.
[08:37.020 --> 08:43.020]  And just like one out of 10 or so gets wanded over and they then search you
[08:43.020 --> 08:46.020]  and then a percentage of those people get strip searched,
[08:46.020 --> 08:50.020]  now you will be directed into the scanner and your neck and body will be stored on hard drives.
[08:50.020 --> 08:55.020]  All about humiliation, all about setting precedence, all about control.
[08:55.020 --> 09:01.020]  Also, we told you at least seven years ago that we saw this in government,
[09:01.020 --> 09:10.020]  Pentagon, MIT, Toyota, governmental reports they submitted to the Japanese government.
[09:10.020 --> 09:13.020]  Everyone will be face scanned to buy and sell.
[09:13.020 --> 09:18.020]  I told you they would phase this in, quote, to stop cigarette smoking and drinking
[09:18.020 --> 09:22.020]  because that was in the corporate and governmental playbooks.
[09:22.020 --> 09:25.020]  They have governmental meetings, it's in their minutes.
[09:25.020 --> 09:28.020]  We've read them on air how they would phase this in.
[09:28.020 --> 09:33.020]  It has now been reported by the AP and as well by British papers that in England and the U.S.
[09:33.020 --> 09:41.020]  they are going to mandate that stores put in face scanners that scan your face
[09:41.020 --> 09:46.020]  to quote stop people underage drinking and getting alcohol and cigarettes.
[09:46.020 --> 09:50.020]  All guilty until proven innocent has nothing to do with stopping drinking and smoking.
[09:50.020 --> 09:55.020]  This will be the new global ID system where not only will you have to swipe the card
[09:55.020 --> 09:58.020]  to buy and sell under a new global sales tax and new carbon tax,
[09:58.020 --> 10:01.020]  but you could have a stolen card.
[10:01.020 --> 10:02.020]  It could be fake.
[10:02.020 --> 10:04.020]  Big Brother has to know who you are.
[10:04.020 --> 10:06.020]  And then, of course, you won't be notified.
[10:06.020 --> 10:09.020]  Generally, the computer will allow you to still get the food,
[10:09.020 --> 10:14.020]  but a SWAT truck that will be deployed, positioned every few miles,
[10:14.020 --> 10:19.020]  will be en route at 80 miles an hour with an assault team to take you to the FEMA camp.
[10:19.020 --> 10:23.020]  Whether you'll be sent to forced labor or to automatic execution.
[10:23.020 --> 10:25.020]  By the way, I'm not saying that for effect.
[10:25.020 --> 10:28.020]  You notice everything I've said in the past is coming true.
[10:28.020 --> 10:29.020]  Okay, it's happened.
[10:29.020 --> 10:31.020]  I'm telling you what the next phase is.
[10:31.020 --> 10:36.020]  I understand their program and nothing is too bold for them.
[10:36.020 --> 10:38.020]  Nothing is too incredible for them.
[10:38.020 --> 10:40.020]  Nothing is too amazing for them.
[10:40.020 --> 10:46.020]  This is the government that writes memos saying we will sexually torture small children in front of their parents
[10:46.020 --> 10:47.020]  and then they did it.
[10:47.020 --> 10:51.020]  This is the government that is handing over the entire infrastructure
[10:51.020 --> 10:55.020]  and putting up toll roads on existing roads and then saying it doesn't exist.
[10:55.020 --> 11:01.020]  This is the government that is completely lawless and totally controlled by scientific tyranny.
[11:01.020 --> 11:06.020]  This is the government that ladens your vaccines with mercury and cancer viruses.
[11:06.020 --> 11:08.020]  This is the government.
[11:08.020 --> 11:10.020]  This is the government that comes to kill, steal and destroy.
[11:10.020 --> 11:11.020]  Okay, I'm already digressing.
[11:11.020 --> 11:14.020]  I just can't believe this one article I've got here.
[11:14.020 --> 11:16.020]  I knew they were going to do it.
[11:16.020 --> 11:18.020]  I knew they said they would do it.
[11:18.020 --> 11:21.020]  It's just they're doing it.
[11:21.020 --> 11:25.020]  I want to be able to continue to fly, but when they...
[11:25.020 --> 11:27.020]  See, I'm not an ignorant sheep.
[11:27.020 --> 11:32.020]  Remember, I told you about five years, six years, maybe longer?
[11:32.020 --> 11:36.020]  I know I read industry documents in 1998.
[11:36.020 --> 11:42.020]  It didn't start until about 2004, so I guess I covered it 10 years ago.
[11:42.020 --> 11:48.020]  But I'm sure that's the story of these flies, that they were going to put thumb scanners in at SeaWorld, at Disney,
[11:48.020 --> 11:55.020]  and then at other parks, and then at tanning salons, and gyms and churches and public school cafeterias and libraries
[11:55.020 --> 11:57.020]  and to get into work.
[11:57.020 --> 12:01.020]  And then now Homeland Security has announced that's what they want nationwide.
[12:01.020 --> 12:08.020]  And it happened, not because I'm smart because they said they would do it that way.
[12:08.020 --> 12:13.420]  And they, uh, so I know just like people keep calling going, wow, I just went to Disney
[12:13.420 --> 12:17.380]  World and it's like you said they, they, they, they, they make you thumb print to get
[12:17.380 --> 12:18.380]  in.
[12:18.380 --> 12:23.100]  Well, no, they don't make you if you say no, they just say, yes, sir, go on through,
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.900]  but 90 plus percent do it.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.340]  It's habitualization.
[12:26.340 --> 12:29.500]  Does the person at the turn stills, are they an evil new order agent?
[12:29.500 --> 12:30.500]  No.
[12:30.500 --> 12:34.500]  Does the local, uh, even manager of the, uh, Disney world know what's going on?
[12:34.500 --> 12:35.940]  No, they're compartmentalized.
[12:35.940 --> 12:37.980]  It's all defense department.
[12:37.980 --> 12:39.340]  They are the infrastructure.
[12:39.340 --> 12:40.860]  They set up the zip code.
[12:40.860 --> 12:42.160]  They set up the GPS.
[12:42.160 --> 12:44.620]  They set up all the standards.
[12:44.620 --> 12:45.620]  They run it.
[12:45.620 --> 12:47.820]  Do you understand?
[12:47.820 --> 12:53.460]  Now, are they going to tell you when you're at the airport, when they say, please step
[12:53.460 --> 12:58.980]  over here and they put you into the chamber, all major airports, 200 plus, that's every
[12:58.980 --> 13:01.220]  major airport.
[13:01.220 --> 13:06.020]  AP, feds are paying for it.
[13:06.020 --> 13:11.700]  Of course, Lockheed and others make them another defense department, up making money, the military
[13:11.700 --> 13:17.660]  system we paid for now turned in against us and they get a biometric naked scan.
[13:17.660 --> 13:21.980]  Now listen, you might as well tell your 20 year old wife, honey, go be in playboy.
[13:21.980 --> 13:26.300]  You might as well get a $50,000 and I'm not being serious.
[13:26.300 --> 13:30.820]  It's, this is a sarcasm, ladies and gentlemen, please don't put me on all the Bible websites
[13:30.820 --> 13:32.740]  saying I'm advocating being in playboy.
[13:32.740 --> 13:33.740]  It's a point.
[13:33.740 --> 13:38.900]  Seriously, though, you might as well go ahead and get $50,000 or whatever they pay to be
[13:38.900 --> 13:45.460]  in playboy or penthouse or go all the way, get into hardcore porn because of a clear
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.980]  image of your naked body.
[13:47.980 --> 13:51.940]  Now they already have the illegal alien goons, which has come out, that's a lot of mar, poking
[13:51.940 --> 13:55.780]  and prodding and pulling the women's dresses up and you say, the government's dumb, why
[13:55.780 --> 13:56.780]  are they doing this?
[13:56.780 --> 13:57.780]  Why is the border open?
[13:57.780 --> 13:58.780]  But this is happening to us.
[13:58.780 --> 14:03.120]  We're a World War II vet on oxygen tanks being searched by these guys, but guys with
[14:03.120 --> 14:04.940]  turbines were walking right through.
[14:04.940 --> 14:06.220]  It doesn't make sense.
[14:06.220 --> 14:08.780]  It doesn't make sense to stop terrorists.
[14:08.780 --> 14:09.780]  That's not what it's for.
[14:09.780 --> 14:14.780]  It's to train you to be a slave.
[14:14.780 --> 14:15.780]  So let me explain.
[14:15.780 --> 14:18.500]  Face scanner's going in and this is how it works.
[14:18.500 --> 14:22.620]  You'll first see Exxon Mobile, Tony the Tiger do it because I noticed they always implement
[14:22.620 --> 14:23.860]  there first.
[14:23.860 --> 14:26.180]  You'll see McDonald's and Walmart implement first.
[14:26.180 --> 14:31.140]  Key partners in rollout of slave grid, then the lobbyists run around and they offer to
[14:31.140 --> 14:36.300]  give it free to the companies and they say, listen, this gives you total liability protection.
[14:36.300 --> 14:39.980]  Local detective comes in and says, do you want the local liquor commission coming in
[14:39.980 --> 14:40.980]  here?
[14:40.980 --> 14:43.860]  You know, this is what they tell the corporate guys at the lower level companies.
[14:43.860 --> 14:46.180]  The big ones are part of the inside deal.
[14:46.180 --> 14:49.500]  Many times own stock in the companies they're putting in the face scanners and that, but
[14:49.500 --> 14:52.940]  the low levels, they come in and they say, look, look, we know you don't, you're trying
[14:52.940 --> 14:53.940]  your people.
[14:53.940 --> 14:58.660]  I mean, why they card 75 year old women, I've seen it for buying cigars for their husband.
[14:58.660 --> 15:03.500]  It's to habitualize that it doesn't make sense that it's crazy that no matter how stupid
[15:03.500 --> 15:06.060]  the order is, you have to follow it.
[15:06.060 --> 15:07.060]  Okay.
[15:07.060 --> 15:12.180]  I mean, I've seen 70 year old, 80 year old people being carded for a bottle of wine,
[15:12.180 --> 15:13.660]  you know, at the gas station.
[15:13.660 --> 15:16.900]  I mean, I see it everywhere and I just start talking.
[15:16.900 --> 15:21.780]  I go, ladies and gentlemen, when they swipe your card right there, that goes into a database
[15:21.780 --> 15:25.980]  and the person behind the card, the other counter, I go, don't roll your eyes.
[15:25.980 --> 15:29.700]  Is that giving you an indicator that says it's authorized and they'll go, yeah.
[15:29.700 --> 15:32.660]  Of course, a lot of times they're a fan behind the counter and they take me behind the counter
[15:32.660 --> 15:36.700]  and go, yeah, they're watching me right now live over the cameras in here, but I don't
[15:36.700 --> 15:37.700]  care if they fire me.
[15:37.700 --> 15:38.700]  I'm sick of this job.
[15:38.700 --> 15:39.700]  Yeah, look, it says authorized.
[15:39.700 --> 15:40.700]  We'll see.
[15:40.700 --> 15:42.740]  There's a whole database on the other end of that.
[15:42.740 --> 15:47.860]  Everything being wired in everything Pentagon designed.
[15:47.860 --> 15:49.380]  You understand the magnitude.
[15:49.380 --> 15:53.620]  See, I'm just getting into one story and then I run off down the rabbit trail into detailing
[15:53.620 --> 15:57.700]  it for you because if I just cover the story and read the headline, it doesn't give you
[15:57.700 --> 16:01.700]  the full spectrum understanding of what we're dealing with here.
[16:01.700 --> 16:07.420]  How creeping it is, how, how, how malevolent it is, how wicked, how the premeditatedness
[16:07.420 --> 16:09.700]  of it.
[16:09.700 --> 16:17.100]  So you're going to walk through the scanners and you're going to go ahead and submit.
[16:17.100 --> 16:18.100]  Not me.
[16:18.100 --> 16:22.420]  You are not going to have a body scan of me.
[16:22.420 --> 16:25.940]  Let's do a pat down you little turkey and people can say, well, just don't fly.
[16:25.940 --> 16:27.700]  I have to fly to fight the new world order.
[16:27.700 --> 16:32.380]  I got to fly to London or fly to Canada or fly to LA or fly to, you know, Nicaragua.
[16:32.380 --> 16:37.340]  I mean, I've got to be able to go and cover these events and do these things.
[16:37.340 --> 16:42.620]  And so I've got to go deal with little monkey brain dumbed down, power tripping, nobodies
[16:42.620 --> 16:47.660]  who really think they're fighting L CIA to, I got a little on their power trip prodding
[16:47.660 --> 16:52.220]  and poking and, you know, every second pressing on the nerve of power and gratiating their
[16:52.220 --> 16:53.220]  psychology.
[16:53.220 --> 16:54.220]  They're really doing something good.
[16:54.220 --> 16:56.940]  Of course, some of them just need a job.
[16:56.940 --> 17:00.820]  I'm not seeing they're all bad, but a lot of them enjoy it when I've had to make fun
[17:00.820 --> 17:02.620]  of me, pull me out of the line, prod me.
[17:02.620 --> 17:05.260]  It's just celebrations of evil and tyranny.
[17:05.260 --> 17:07.620]  See them do it to other people.
[17:07.620 --> 17:08.620]  It isn't that.
[17:08.620 --> 17:12.300]  It's that, that how do I let my wife and children ever fly?
[17:12.300 --> 17:16.660]  When I know they'll be in the hands of paramilitary goons that are going to stick them in a chamber
[17:16.660 --> 17:22.620]  to take pornographic photos, full body, 360 scans to be stored in your database.
[17:22.620 --> 17:27.220]  Remember, I told you 12 years ago, they're taking your DNA at birth and putting it in
[17:27.220 --> 17:28.540]  a global database.
[17:28.540 --> 17:34.780]  Now Bush just signed a bill to legalize retroactively what they've been doing.
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.460]  The government is criminal.
[17:36.460 --> 17:37.700]  It's rogue.
[17:37.700 --> 17:41.740]  It is a rogue government as a website called rogue government.
[17:41.740 --> 17:44.540]  I was thinking last night what a good name that is.
[17:44.540 --> 17:49.940]  It is, it's just rogue, rogue government, smart criminals that use scientific engineers
[17:49.940 --> 17:55.380]  to set up the grid using behavioral psychology.
[17:55.380 --> 17:57.540]  And I'm sitting here watching nightfall happen.
[17:57.540 --> 17:59.620]  I'm sitting here watching tyranny come down.
[17:59.620 --> 18:01.940]  I'm sitting here watching the grid go into place.
[18:01.940 --> 18:05.940]  I'm just desperately trying to get on more in AM and FM's and trying to get you to tell
[18:05.940 --> 18:10.180]  people how to tune into the show or onto the internet streams of the podcast because I
[18:10.180 --> 18:11.500]  want to stop these people.
[18:11.500 --> 18:15.700]  I know it's horrible because once the grid's in place, they're going to release the bio
[18:15.700 --> 18:16.700]  weapons.
[18:16.700 --> 18:20.260]  Do you understand police, military, FBI, all of you?
[18:20.260 --> 18:24.340]  You're not going to believe me now, but years from now, maybe a decade, maybe 20 years,
[18:24.340 --> 18:28.140]  maybe next month, when they think their grid is in place, that's when they're going to
[18:28.140 --> 18:29.660]  release the plagues.
[18:29.660 --> 18:31.980]  And the shots they're going to give you aren't going to protect you.
[18:31.980 --> 18:36.020]  They want to wipe out masses of people, billions of people.
[18:36.020 --> 18:40.740]  They constantly talk about it, go to any big biology awards ceremony.
[18:40.740 --> 18:45.980]  I guarantee you, you'll be in a room with thousands of people with 160 IQs talking about
[18:45.980 --> 18:49.820]  how they want to kill everybody, and they work in the bio weapons labs.
[18:49.820 --> 18:51.820]  You want to do real investigations?
[18:51.820 --> 18:54.500]  I can't believe it.
[18:54.500 --> 18:55.500]  Just can't believe it.
[18:55.500 --> 18:56.500]  And it's going to happen.
[18:56.500 --> 18:57.820]  You're not going to listen.
[18:57.820 --> 18:58.820]  You won't.
[18:58.820 --> 19:00.020]  You're on a personal power trip.
[19:00.020 --> 19:05.780]  It's too important to you to live the delusion you're in and to think that I'm the crazy one.
[19:05.780 --> 19:08.980]  I told you they'd face Kenya to buy and sell.
[19:08.980 --> 19:15.180]  I told you they would implement it under the guise of stopping underage drinking, scanning
[19:15.180 --> 19:21.140]  out of photos out of the driver's license national ID card database.
[19:21.140 --> 19:22.340]  God help us.
[19:22.340 --> 19:24.340]  It's in the mainstream news.
[19:24.340 --> 19:25.620]  They're not talking about it.
[19:25.620 --> 19:27.620]  They're putting it in.
[19:27.620 --> 19:34.980]  Do you realize, ladies and gentlemen, that the minute their grid's in place, beta tested,
[19:34.980 --> 19:36.780]  they are going to start the killing?
[19:36.780 --> 19:42.380]  Now, in the lead up to the lockdown grid, they're going to have controlled, smaller bioreleases.
[19:42.380 --> 19:45.660]  Each one bigger, like SARS, like bird flu.
[19:45.660 --> 19:49.660]  We're facing hell on earth, ladies and gentlemen, and in your gut, you know I'm telling the
[19:49.660 --> 19:50.660]  truth.
[19:50.660 --> 19:51.660]  But you don't have to believe your gut.
[19:51.660 --> 19:54.860]  Go check out the facts.
[19:54.860 --> 19:57.540]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[19:57.540 --> 20:02.380]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the
[20:02.380 --> 20:07.020]  cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[20:07.020 --> 20:12.340]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are
[20:12.340 --> 20:14.900]  totally unnecessary?
[20:14.900 --> 20:17.700]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die.
[20:17.700 --> 20:23.420]  With lace med inks, patented methodology, without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging
[20:23.420 --> 20:29.380]  radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse
[20:29.380 --> 20:32.380]  side effects at our physician's office.

[21:16.060 --> 21:17.980]  crime are brought to justice.
[21:17.980 --> 21:21.460]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.

[21:52.100 --> 21:53.100]  to Big Brother.
[21:53.100 --> 22:18.900]  Here is another untold story that most do not know, which has to do with that famous
[22:18.900 --> 22:22.900]  finger gesture called flipping the bird.
[22:22.900 --> 22:27.900]  That gesture, that story, has to do with that phrase, pluck you.
[22:27.900 --> 22:35.100]  No, no, we said that phrase, pluck, P-L-U-C-K, you, which, by the way, comes from the phrase
[22:35.100 --> 22:39.340]  plucking the you, and it all comes from history.
[22:39.340 --> 22:43.860]  History pertaining to the battle of Argonne Court in 1415.
[22:43.860 --> 22:47.700]  It was a fierce battle between the French and the English, which the French felt sure
[22:47.700 --> 22:54.060]  to win, and so made a boast of what they were going to do to the English once they did.
[22:54.060 --> 22:58.860]  They boasted for naught for the battle they lost, and as a result of the boast and the
[22:58.860 --> 23:05.620]  loss, the victors before and after the battle came up with the famous salute we today call
[23:05.620 --> 23:07.500]  flipping the bird.
[23:07.500 --> 23:10.260]  And it has to do with plucking the you.
[23:10.260 --> 23:14.940]  It was all once understood, but is now unknown and untold.
[23:14.940 --> 23:18.780]  We do tell it, however, at anotheruntoldstory.com.
[23:18.780 --> 23:22.580]  Go there and hear it at anotheruntoldstory.com.
[23:22.580 --> 23:25.540]  That's anotheruntoldstory.com.
[23:25.540 --> 23:31.740]  Go there now for it's only posted there, but for a short period of time, anotheruntoldstory.com.
[23:31.740 --> 23:50.420]  That's quite a story.
[24:13.700 --> 24:20.020]  I've got three news articles today without looking with powerful, globalist, royalty
[24:20.020 --> 24:25.540]  university heads saying they want to reduce world population by 80 percent, have one
[24:25.540 --> 24:31.260]  child policies in the U.S. deny health care to the old, carry out eugenics.
[24:31.260 --> 24:32.860]  Do you understand police?
[24:32.860 --> 24:37.140]  You can go to the Texas Academy of Sciences when they gave Dr. Pionka the lifetime achievement
[24:37.140 --> 24:42.260]  ward, one of the top scientists at UT, and Dr. Pionka gave a speech about how he can't
[24:42.260 --> 24:46.060]  wait till 90 percent of us die.
[24:46.060 --> 24:49.900]  There's a big group that got international attention yesterday calling for all humans
[24:49.900 --> 24:50.900]  to die.
[24:50.900 --> 24:52.900]  Okay, do you understand?
[24:52.900 --> 24:54.260]  Get it through your head.
[24:54.260 --> 24:55.260]  You're not powerful.
[24:55.260 --> 24:56.860]  You're not in control.
[24:56.860 --> 24:58.820]  You're not as tough as you think you are.
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.540]  The world isn't the way you think it is.
[25:01.540 --> 25:03.100]  I'm already digressing it.
[25:03.100 --> 25:06.220]  I just wish you would listen to me.
[25:06.220 --> 25:12.940]  I wish you would understand how serious things are, how deep things are, how far gone things
[25:12.940 --> 25:13.940]  are.
[25:13.940 --> 25:14.940]  Look at this.
[25:14.940 --> 25:19.380]  Ecogroup calls for voluntary human extinction, says master should be indoctrinated to stop
[25:19.380 --> 25:24.100]  having children in order, that the human race can die out and save the planet.
[25:24.100 --> 25:28.100]  This is being reported by the Times of London and others, and then it gets into the, it's
[25:28.100 --> 25:31.220]  just so sick, and they want to teach school children this.
[25:31.220 --> 25:34.660]  By the way, as you know, for 50 years, it's already been taught to school children.
[25:34.660 --> 25:36.500]  I can get into that whole program.
[25:36.500 --> 25:40.660]  I have with John Taylor, Godo, and others, but I'm already digressing.
[25:40.660 --> 25:44.300]  I haven't even gotten into the stack of news, and I said I would do it.
[25:44.300 --> 25:46.020]  We're going to do it in the next segment.
[25:46.020 --> 25:48.900]  Just getting back to Derry Brownfield, coming to the network starting next month, and he's
[25:48.900 --> 25:50.500]  already on the network.
[25:50.500 --> 25:56.340]  We're one of his satellite affiliates, but excited about that, but I heard him talking,
[25:56.340 --> 26:02.980]  and he was reading newspaper articles and reading out of a book called Thirst that I've
[26:02.980 --> 26:07.180]  read a large excerpts of years ago, and it first came out, and I've experienced this
[26:07.180 --> 26:08.180]  personally.
[26:08.180 --> 26:09.180]  Let me explain.
[26:09.180 --> 26:11.260]  This is just one facet.
[26:11.260 --> 26:14.780]  This is somewhere you can document it right now for yourself, or most of you remember this
[26:14.780 --> 26:21.660]  happening in your town or city, and this is just something that isn't as shocking or
[26:21.660 --> 26:25.380]  scary sounding as, hey, the people running the global government, are you a genesis
[26:25.380 --> 26:27.020]  and want to kill you?
[26:27.020 --> 26:30.060]  They even made James Bond movies about it.
[26:30.060 --> 26:31.820]  They put reality into fiction.
[26:31.820 --> 26:36.460]  Remember, Moon Raker, they want to kill everybody on the earth while they sit on the space station,
[26:36.460 --> 26:38.740]  and they're going to come back and peep all the earth with Superman.
[26:38.740 --> 26:43.580]  Well, they actually have government documents and ideas and plans to do that, but do it
[26:43.580 --> 26:46.980]  underground and then reemerge.
[26:46.980 --> 26:50.660]  Just like the last James Bond movie was about government-sponsored terror or institutionalized
[26:50.660 --> 26:55.660]  sponsored terror, and the one before that was about DNA, individual bio weapons, and
[26:55.660 --> 26:59.420]  DNA harvesting, and life extension technologies, but I'm already digressing.
[26:59.420 --> 27:06.380]  The point here is that there's a whole reality around you you're not aware of, and that life
[27:06.380 --> 27:12.180]  is not the McDonald's signs and the Walmart signs and people in fancy dresses and riding
[27:12.180 --> 27:15.180]  around on Harleys, and I'm not saying any of that's bad.
[27:15.180 --> 27:18.900]  I'm saying that's all just a facade.
[27:18.900 --> 27:24.620]  We are these creatures, these homo sapiens sapiens that have babies and live, and we
[27:24.620 --> 27:29.020]  live on a beautiful planet with trees and water, and I don't know what type of birds
[27:29.020 --> 27:30.020]  they are.
[27:30.020 --> 27:32.340]  They're living right outside my front door.
[27:32.340 --> 27:35.340]  They've got red chest and blue bodies, and they're little babies.
[27:35.340 --> 27:36.420]  I can watch them.
[27:36.420 --> 27:37.420]  They're mommy feeding them.
[27:37.420 --> 27:41.780]  I mean, it's magic, and there's this whole cosmos around us, and we're going around this
[27:41.780 --> 27:42.780]  sun.
[27:42.780 --> 27:49.340]  I mean, last night I was watching footage from our new film just of the New York East
[27:49.340 --> 27:54.220]  River and its sunset, and I was looking at the beautiful waves, you know, that the high
[27:54.220 --> 27:58.820]  def camera caught, and I was just stricken by the beauty, and I was like, my God, it's
[27:58.820 --> 27:59.820]  a paradox.
[27:59.820 --> 28:03.940]  There's all this beauty, all this incredible creation around us.
[28:03.940 --> 28:10.500]  All of God's handiwork, our beautiful families, our wonderful children, our wonderful elders,
[28:10.500 --> 28:17.900]  the histories, our pets, our artwork, our lives, our memories, it's all so wonderful.
[28:17.900 --> 28:23.380]  My life is wonderful, but then overhanging it is this growing global evil and all the
[28:23.380 --> 28:26.500]  corruption and all the things they do and all their handiwork.
[28:26.500 --> 28:32.820]  I mean, it's all bad, and you know, while your life's going good, the CPS is snatching
[28:32.820 --> 28:37.420]  the kid down the street, or while your life's good, the kid down the street just got on government
[28:37.420 --> 28:42.260]  shipped in cocaine, or the kid down the street just got busted using government shipped
[28:42.260 --> 28:47.780]  in cocaine, and then, or the kid down the street was late to class three times in Austin,
[28:47.780 --> 28:52.580]  so they were arrested under truancy charges, or the airport down the street's putting
[28:52.580 --> 28:59.180]  in a 360 body scanner to scan your body and put you in a government database, or right
[28:59.180 --> 29:02.980]  down the street at the hospital, they're taking your baby's blood and putting it in a Homeland
[29:02.980 --> 29:07.460]  Security crime database, and digitizing it, and doing medical experiments with it, and
[29:07.460 --> 29:13.260]  admitting it all.
[29:13.260 --> 29:16.020]  It's totally criminal.
[29:16.020 --> 29:17.220]  We have to protect the good.
[29:17.220 --> 29:20.220]  When I get back, I'll tell you about what Brownfield was talking about today with the
[29:20.220 --> 29:21.220]  water.
[29:21.220 --> 29:23.740]  This will bring it home to you, because it's even worse than what he was saying.
[29:23.740 --> 29:24.740]  It's always worse.
[29:24.740 --> 29:28.740]  In fact, it's so bad that if I studied for a year on this one subject and try to bring
[29:28.740 --> 29:30.420]  you all the evidence, I couldn't do it.
[29:30.420 --> 29:36.100]  I mean, what we know is so horrible, it can't even be articulated, imagine what else is
[29:36.100 --> 29:37.100]  going on.
[29:37.100 --> 29:44.300]  Not just the poison in the water, this is a separate subject.
[29:44.300 --> 29:48.020]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:48.020 --> 29:57.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:57.020 --> 30:01.460]  We're already under a scientific dictatorship, martial law is coming, but it's not going
[30:01.460 --> 30:02.900]  to arrive overnight.
[30:02.900 --> 30:04.860]  It's going to be incremental.
[30:04.860 --> 30:06.820]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[30:06.820 --> 30:10.100]  Any incidents, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[30:10.100 --> 30:11.300]  Anything could be the final push.

[30:14.900 --> 30:17.220]  you for life under total military control.

[30:20.660 --> 30:23.780]  Learn how to act around controlling troops, and how to use their own psychology against
[30:23.780 --> 30:25.500]  them through social engineering.
[30:25.500 --> 30:28.900]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations
[30:28.900 --> 30:32.100]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[30:32.100 --> 30:34.940]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years, preparing for
[30:34.940 --> 30:35.940]  this takeover.

[30:54.260 --> 30:58.500]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[30:58.500 --> 31:03.060]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:03.060 --> 31:09.060]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[31:09.060 --> 31:12.220]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[31:12.220 --> 31:18.140]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[31:18.140 --> 31:20.820]  of humanity is at hand.
[31:20.820 --> 31:27.180]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide
[31:27.180 --> 31:28.180]  open.
[31:28.180 --> 31:31.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[31:31.900 --> 31:34.580]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[31:34.580 --> 31:37.700]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[31:37.700 --> 31:38.700]  They're after power.
[31:38.700 --> 31:39.700]  That's their aptitude.

[31:48.340 --> 31:53.100]  Blue prep for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[31:53.100 --> 31:57.300]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity
[31:57.300 --> 31:58.460]  theft each year.
[31:58.460 --> 32:03.020]  The crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims an average
[32:03.020 --> 32:04.500]  of $8,000.
[32:04.500 --> 32:08.980]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection
[32:08.980 --> 32:12.020]  between a hacker and your personal information.
[32:12.020 --> 32:15.900]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file or any other file that
[32:15.900 --> 32:20.660]  is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[33:10.500 --> 33:14.780]  Steve Ellison, Dave, Mike, Andrew, your calls are coming up after I cover some of the news
[33:14.780 --> 33:15.780]  headlines here.
[33:15.780 --> 33:19.780]  But I was listening to Derry Brownfield this morning read different news articles from
[33:19.780 --> 33:26.820]  locally in his town, cover other stories around the country where they would just calmly come
[33:26.820 --> 33:33.420]  out, say in a California town or one case, your bill is $240 a month for water, which
[33:33.420 --> 33:39.740]  by the way is exorbitant, and the new company comes in out of Germany but they have a subsidiary
[33:39.740 --> 33:45.420]  called California Water Systems, California American Water Systems, and then they come
[33:45.420 --> 33:52.020]  in and they say, it's now $1,270 and if you don't pay it, they just turn your water
[33:52.020 --> 33:53.020]  off.
[33:53.020 --> 33:57.460]  It's total highway robbery and the federal government is mandating with regulations
[33:57.460 --> 34:01.620]  that local governments accept the takeover by these groups.
[34:01.620 --> 34:04.460]  Let me give you another example.
[34:04.460 --> 34:09.780]  I remember living in Austin and about nine years ago they picked your trash up twice
[34:09.780 --> 34:16.380]  a day and then suddenly a new company, one that had been on 60 minutes in other places
[34:16.380 --> 34:23.340]  for being mafia owned and run, came in and took it over and it tripled in price and they
[34:23.340 --> 34:27.820]  started coming once a week and then they would look in your garbage and it was like a board
[34:27.820 --> 34:28.820]  or something in there.
[34:28.820 --> 34:36.180]  They would call that construction waste and would leave all your trash there.
[34:36.180 --> 34:40.420]  And so they've increased it since then.
[34:40.420 --> 34:42.420]  So that's how privatization works.
[34:42.420 --> 34:47.100]  That just means a private group came in and bought off your mayor, whose wife will then
[34:47.100 --> 34:53.060]  publicly get a consultant job for the company for $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a year doing
[34:53.060 --> 34:55.500]  nothing.
[34:55.500 --> 34:57.980]  I mean it's slick, folks.
[34:57.980 --> 34:59.700]  That's how they operate.
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.220]  And it's the same in everything.
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.300]  It's the same with school.
[35:03.300 --> 35:05.100]  It's the same with taxes.
[35:05.100 --> 35:09.220]  It's the same with everything they do and the bridges are collapsing and the roads are
[35:09.220 --> 35:13.340]  falling apart, but they're still slapping new toll roads on them and they've got cops
[35:13.340 --> 35:15.860]  out riding tickets and they tell the cops, oh, we're bankrupt.
[35:15.860 --> 35:19.820]  We've got to write more tickets and the cops hear how the bridges are collapsing and the
[35:19.820 --> 35:23.820]  more tickets they write, the less money goes to bridges.
[35:23.820 --> 35:29.340]  Right here in Texas, the feds took $7 billion out of the federal fund for Texas that Texas
[35:29.340 --> 35:35.380]  paid into it and just sent it to Iraq last year alone.
[35:35.380 --> 35:36.740]  And that's every state.
[35:36.740 --> 35:37.740]  That's how it works.
[35:37.740 --> 35:43.260]  And then they tell the cops, you're going to have a pay cut unless you write more tickets.
[35:43.260 --> 35:46.380]  So they go out and write tickets and of course it doesn't go to them.
[35:46.380 --> 35:51.060]  It's just, it's totally and completely sick.
[35:51.060 --> 35:56.180]  And that's how they're doing it and you can read the IMF World Bank.
[35:56.180 --> 35:58.020]  You can read the Club of Rome documents.
[35:58.020 --> 36:01.420]  You can read all their statements going back 30 years ago where they said, we're going
[36:01.420 --> 36:06.300]  to go in, we're going to lobby, we're going to take over the water supplies and then we're
[36:06.300 --> 36:10.780]  going to jack up prices, just hundreds of documents.
[36:10.780 --> 36:14.340]  And in the IMF World Bank documents that were leaked in 2002, I talked so much about because
[36:14.340 --> 36:16.060]  I went and read thousands of pages of them.
[36:16.060 --> 36:19.980]  That's why I'm, it's just an entire blueprint right there.
[36:19.980 --> 36:24.540]  They said, in fact, we'll go into countries and completely turn the water off once we
[36:24.540 --> 36:30.500]  own it because then they'll really panic and riot and then they'll accept anything afterwards.
[36:30.500 --> 36:31.740]  It's all psychology.
[36:31.740 --> 36:33.140]  It's all raping you.
[36:33.140 --> 36:34.420]  It's all squeezing you.
[36:34.420 --> 36:37.420]  It's all driving you into submission.
[36:37.420 --> 36:42.100]  Now these same foreign companies that come in and buy up your water and then double the
[36:42.100 --> 36:47.820]  price, triple the price quadruple the price then each year after double the price.
[36:47.820 --> 36:49.100]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[36:49.100 --> 36:54.900]  The entire state of Texas has two large aquifers that cover the entire state.
[36:54.900 --> 37:00.460]  It is, in some cases, thousands of feet deep, everywhere else, hundreds of feet deep, pure
[37:00.460 --> 37:02.660]  water, totally clean everywhere.
[37:02.660 --> 37:07.740]  Just giant aquifers, two big ones and it's enough water to give the entire United States
[37:07.740 --> 37:08.740]  water forever.
[37:08.740 --> 37:10.340]  I mean, it's just, it's just unlimited.
[37:10.340 --> 37:11.500]  It's always being replenished.
[37:11.500 --> 37:12.500]  It doesn't matter.
[37:12.500 --> 37:16.540]  They run PR campaigns telling you there's no water, got to accept higher prices.
[37:16.540 --> 37:19.500]  It's your carbon footprint because of the earth being in trouble.
[37:19.500 --> 37:24.420]  We have to pay more and the public, they have huge PR campaigns that say you've got to pay
[37:24.420 --> 37:28.100]  more now because there's no water.
[37:28.100 --> 37:29.100]  And why shouldn't they?
[37:29.100 --> 37:34.300]  I mean, if they're going to be able to quadruple and then plus all your water bills, they're
[37:34.300 --> 37:38.280]  just taking a few percentage points of that and not just buying the mayors and city councils
[37:38.280 --> 37:43.020]  and county commissioners and state legislators and the feds demanded it all.
[37:43.020 --> 37:46.500]  Feds come in and say, you know what, we're not going to give you any of your water funding,
[37:46.500 --> 37:51.420]  though we take your money from the states and 33 cents back on average, unless you accept,
[37:51.420 --> 37:54.980]  unless it's a privatization, then they have a bunch of fake libertarians dance around
[37:54.980 --> 37:59.500]  and go privatize, privatize, but it's not privatization.
[37:59.500 --> 38:02.500]  It's taking our water systems we paid for with tax money.
[38:02.500 --> 38:07.220]  See, first the feds said, oh, you just got to put fluoride in it, fed, feds say.
[38:07.220 --> 38:11.020]  You got to put chlorine in it, feds say, doesn't matter if it's totally clean out of an aquifer.
[38:11.020 --> 38:15.460]  Feds say, and then now feds say, you got to let this German company or Dutch company or
[38:15.460 --> 38:20.700]  Chinese company or Russian company or British company and every time you look, it's not
[38:20.700 --> 38:21.700]  US companies.
[38:21.700 --> 38:22.700]  Those don't exist anymore.
[38:22.700 --> 38:26.540]  They're all globalists and they just come in and they, they have the national water
[38:26.540 --> 38:32.700]  council, national association of governors, association of city managers and they fly
[38:32.700 --> 38:38.660]  around and they're given public bribes, Supreme court ruled two years ago that private companies
[38:38.660 --> 38:50.180]  can give bribes, it said now legal, go read the ruling, Kilo versus Connecticut, the Kilo
[38:50.180 --> 38:55.900]  decision and you can go in there and read it and it says legalize, they can come, it's
[38:55.900 --> 39:00.100]  piracy, letter of mark, they come in, they pay, they just take it, take your property,
[39:00.100 --> 39:01.100]  no just compensation.
[39:01.100 --> 39:04.820]  You see, everybody was freaking out about the ruling, but the news didn't even tell you
[39:04.820 --> 39:06.020]  the real ruling.
[39:06.020 --> 39:11.860]  The news said, yeah, they save a private interest once it, they can get your property.
[39:11.860 --> 39:16.460]  Eve quote, they'll pay more taxes, that's the public good time, but when you read the
[39:16.460 --> 39:20.980]  ruling it said, they can come in, take your property and not pay you.
[39:20.980 --> 39:22.420]  Did you know that?
[39:22.420 --> 39:27.740]  And then all the Texas landowners got letters about the landowners bill of rights.
[39:27.740 --> 39:33.500]  Oh, you, we passed something to give you rights and it says in the, in the huge 40 plus page
[39:33.500 --> 39:39.460]  letter that all Texas landowners, by all Texas land people that have over 30, 40 acres, our
[39:39.460 --> 39:44.300]  family got them and it said, listen, we're going to be putting in pipelines and taking
[39:44.300 --> 39:49.540]  land and if you don't take our first offer within six months, we not only take the land,
[39:49.540 --> 39:55.140]  we then charge you legal fees and they said, this is your new right.
[39:55.140 --> 40:00.300]  You have no recourse, sell immediately for what we offer and it's already happened all
[40:00.300 --> 40:05.500]  over Texas, they come in and they say, we want your 500 acres and you go, but it's,
[40:05.500 --> 40:09.220]  but it's valued on the tax rolls at, you know, $50,000 an acre.
[40:09.220 --> 40:12.660]  So I should be getting millions of dollars and they say, nope, we're going to give you
[40:12.660 --> 40:18.100]  a $1,000 an acre and you're like, but that's 150th of what it's worth.
[40:18.100 --> 40:20.940]  And they just say, listen, that's it.
[40:20.940 --> 40:25.620]  And then six months later, they take your property and if you don't leave and this has happened,
[40:25.620 --> 40:30.740]  they send the SWAT team, men in black mask, come in armored vehicles and if you fight
[40:30.740 --> 40:37.540]  back, they kill you, it's real simple.
[40:37.540 --> 40:40.420]  And it's all happened before.
[40:40.420 --> 40:46.660]  It's all happened before the Rockefellers in Illinois and in Colorado and in Pennsylvania
[40:46.660 --> 40:52.140]  and in New York and in New Jersey and all over the country, hundreds of cases.
[40:52.140 --> 40:56.380]  They would hire Pickerton security or two other major firms and they would, and I mean,
[40:56.380 --> 41:01.460]  this happened just 75 years ago, 80 years ago, one of the worst cases, over a hundred
[41:01.460 --> 41:06.340]  and they would come into whole tent cities of people that went in and state claims on
[41:06.340 --> 41:12.980]  national lands and found gold, found silver, found box site, found oil, didn't matter.
[41:12.980 --> 41:17.580]  And they just ride in with guys on horses or guys in armored cars and they'd open up
[41:17.580 --> 41:22.100]  the back with a machine gun and they'd just shoot every person and it was admitted in
[41:22.100 --> 41:24.380]  the police reports and the police were there helping.
[41:24.380 --> 41:28.980]  They would ride down small children, they would burn families up inside shacks and then
[41:28.980 --> 41:31.780]  they'd loot every bit of money they had.
[41:31.780 --> 41:34.620]  That was their extra payment.
[41:34.620 --> 41:39.540]  Hard core killers, that railroad train would pull up, they'd ride their horses right down
[41:39.540 --> 41:45.620]  that ramp and they were coming to kill and they killed and they killed and they killed
[41:45.620 --> 41:50.300]  and they killed and they killed up one side and down the other of this country and they're
[41:50.300 --> 41:51.660]  going to kill again.
[41:51.660 --> 41:59.220]  This is their time, their time to rule, their time for you to learn and I'm so sick of them.
[41:59.220 --> 42:06.660]  Open criminal zest, filth, just absolute, viper venomous, pit of hell, blood sucking,
[42:06.660 --> 42:12.300]  tyrannical, bully murderers.
[42:12.300 --> 42:18.900]  You read the accounts of those families burning up and those families running, they say pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.
[42:18.900 --> 42:23.220]  Or you read about just 80 years ago in New Jersey in places where families would be starving
[42:23.220 --> 42:28.100]  to death living in their shacks and they'd go in to manage just a few cents more an hour
[42:28.100 --> 42:32.580]  and here would come the National Guard with their guns and they'd mow every one of their
[42:32.580 --> 42:37.620]  people down right there.
[42:37.620 --> 42:43.180]  That's how this country works, that's how it operates.
[42:43.180 --> 42:49.300]  I ought to make a film about that and if you don't think these SWAT teams, 90% of them won't
[42:49.300 --> 42:54.140]  follow orders, they will follow orders all the way to hell.
[42:54.140 --> 43:00.700]  They'll do whatever they're told, when they're told, how they're told, they will do it.
[43:00.700 --> 43:05.180]  I said I'd get to your calls, I just think about the open criminality but see the average
[43:05.180 --> 43:10.180]  person doesn't think about where water comes from, they just think water comes out of the
[43:10.180 --> 43:16.780]  tap and I get a bill.
[43:16.780 --> 43:20.540]  Your bill goes from 240 which is an exorbitant.
[43:20.540 --> 43:33.300]  You look back 10 years ago that same bill had been 20 bucks, 15 bucks, 1200 plus dollars,
[43:33.300 --> 43:41.700]  I mean your trash pickup triples in price and you get half the service overnight baby.
[43:41.700 --> 43:44.900]  And then you literally look at the trash company here we have locally and it's owned by the
[43:44.900 --> 43:45.900]  Carleones.
[43:45.900 --> 43:53.020]  I mean sarcastic, a well-known Italian family, a national newscast by other mafia.
[43:53.020 --> 43:57.100]  That's how America works.
[43:57.100 --> 44:00.340]  That's how it runs.
[44:00.340 --> 44:07.220]  Two rules and I'm sick of them.
[44:07.220 --> 44:10.260]  Now if you really get into the history books, every time the National Guard with Pinkerton
[44:10.260 --> 44:16.660]  security mowed people down, bad stuff happened to those people, oh yeah.
[44:16.660 --> 44:24.980]  Because the cousin of the people that died would spend years, would sell everything they
[44:24.980 --> 44:30.220]  had, would spend years quietly finding out who did it and then things would happen.
[44:30.220 --> 44:34.220]  Years later, one of those old Pinkerton boys, it might be 25 years later, would walk out
[44:34.220 --> 44:38.140]  on their front porch, a nice little spread from stolen money, from money they got from
[44:38.140 --> 44:40.940]  the Rockefellers and others.
[44:40.940 --> 44:46.900]  The guy walks out to get in his little Model T to ride down to town and there's somebody
[44:46.900 --> 44:50.580]  waiting for him, hey you know why I'm here, you killed my cousin.
[44:50.580 --> 44:52.860]  Now you're gonna die.
[44:52.860 --> 44:58.980]  But they still did it even knowing that would happen.
[44:58.980 --> 45:02.940]  Now that doesn't happen, somebody kills your family, you go squealing and crying to the
[45:02.940 --> 45:08.780]  government, hey they killed my family for no reason, government is wrong.
[45:08.780 --> 45:14.420]  And then you hear people go, the government's dumb, they don't believe me, I am innocent.
[45:14.420 --> 45:19.540]  My brother was innocent, I didn't do it, there's even video of it, why don't you help, don't
[45:19.540 --> 45:21.540]  you?
[45:21.540 --> 45:25.540]  And then the people that are abused always think it's an accident, it's no accident slave.
[45:25.540 --> 45:35.900]  You're here to be sucked off of, that's what you're here for.
[45:35.900 --> 45:40.260]  So now you know why I don't like you spending time watching football and acting tough and
[45:40.260 --> 45:43.340]  strutting around with your buddies at the pool hall.
[45:43.340 --> 45:47.420]  As a man you should be fighting this tyranny, not the facsimile of a man that Hollywood
[45:47.420 --> 45:54.820]  told you, some guy walking around flexing his muscles, bulging his eyes out at his neighbor
[45:54.820 --> 46:01.140]  whose tail goes between their legs when a cop asks him a question.
[46:01.140 --> 46:05.260]  A man, a real man's nice to his neighbors but then his tail doesn't go between his legs
[46:05.260 --> 46:10.420]  when a cop asks him a question or pulls him over.
[46:10.420 --> 46:18.300]  So you're not really men, a real man would be informed and aware of what's happening
[46:18.300 --> 46:22.060]  and would have their instincts alerted and would be doing everything they could to try
[46:22.060 --> 46:28.100]  to reverse where we're going because a real man would be having his guardian instinct
[46:28.100 --> 46:34.300]  employed to protect his friends, his family, his neighbors.
[46:34.300 --> 46:39.020]  The globalists have taken the guardian instinct and warped and turned it into a looting, feeding
[46:39.020 --> 46:43.820]  frenzy instinct against us and they've used the guardian instinct to neutralize you and
[46:43.820 --> 46:49.460]  said these men who are looting you, who are pillaging you, who are taking booty from you,
[46:49.460 --> 46:50.740]  they're protecting you.
[46:50.740 --> 46:54.660]  It's all about your instincts, it's all about how you operate, they're punching all those
[46:54.660 --> 47:00.460]  buttons all day long instead of you taking control of those buttons.
[47:00.460 --> 47:04.100]  There's two ways to do this, either you're in control of the buttons or they are.
[47:04.100 --> 47:08.740]  It's time to start using your own buttons, time to start punching your own buttons, that's
[47:08.740 --> 47:13.860]  the secret to life.
[47:13.860 --> 47:16.700]  Either you're at the helm or they're at the helm.
[47:16.700 --> 47:21.100]  Now here's the type of news I got today, what we'll do is we'll take your calls, then we'll
[47:21.100 --> 47:23.540]  go to the guest, then I'll get to it all, I try.
[47:23.540 --> 47:30.220]  JPMorgan Chase CEO recession just beginning, IE that means JPMorgan Chase, the private
[47:30.220 --> 47:36.500]  arm of the Federal Reserve's squeezing and sucking off of you just begun.
[47:36.500 --> 47:40.580]  Bush says greatest fear is another terror attack, Fair Monger says Al-Qaeda's going to
[47:40.580 --> 47:48.460]  get us to give up all your rights, oil steady after record near $127 a barrel and that's
[47:48.460 --> 47:49.460]  the headlines.
[47:49.460 --> 47:54.660]  Oh, oil went down a little, it goes from $40 a barrel to $127 and it'll drop down to
[47:54.660 --> 47:59.580]  $125 and go to $130 and then they'll only do headlines for you when it drops a few dollars
[47:59.580 --> 48:01.460]  creating a psychological illusion.
[48:01.460 --> 48:05.140]  I read British warfare manuals on that from the 50s.
[48:05.140 --> 48:08.580]  That's a number game they play, you ought to look into it yourself to always announce
[48:08.580 --> 48:12.860]  it when it's gone down a dollar or two and then not announce it when it goes up $10.
[48:12.860 --> 48:17.580]  Oh, oil's down, only $127 a barrel.
[48:17.580 --> 48:22.300]  Oil prices were steady Wednesday after moving back from an overnight trading record near
[48:22.300 --> 48:31.980]  $127 a barrel on concerns that Iran may cut production.
[48:31.980 --> 48:37.300]  Democrats propose taxes to fund veterans' benefits, oh, it's for the veterans.
[48:37.300 --> 48:40.740]  Yeah, the government has had plenty of money to take care of the veterans.
[48:40.740 --> 48:43.820]  We've had experts on, veterans groups on to cover that.
[48:43.820 --> 48:47.580]  They just keep all the money and don't give it to them.
[48:47.580 --> 48:53.660]  See, don't fill the potholes, don't have police, new radios or the firemen with new radios.
[48:53.660 --> 48:57.020]  Advertise that the radios don't work, then demand a new tax increase that never goes
[48:57.020 --> 48:58.020]  to that.
[48:58.020 --> 49:02.940]  I remember seeing scores of bond proposals in Austin, Texas back when I was mainly covering
[49:02.940 --> 49:08.340]  local stuff 13 years ago, where there'd be a bond for $50 million, a bond for $100 million,
[49:08.340 --> 49:12.420]  a bond for $10 million, and then the bonds matured and they never even cash them in.
[49:12.420 --> 49:15.260]  They never even spend the money.
[49:15.260 --> 49:18.660]  Just huge investments, and it was always for firefighters.
[49:18.660 --> 49:23.580]  It was always for children, nothing to do with it.
[49:23.580 --> 49:31.580]  Oh, man, you gotta love it sometimes, it's just so funny if it wasn't so sick.
[49:31.580 --> 49:36.940]  Veterans propose tax to fund veterans, anybody making $500,000 or more, it's only a 2% tax
[49:36.940 --> 49:38.420]  to start with.
[49:38.420 --> 49:43.060]  Of course, that's how the income tax started.
[49:43.060 --> 49:49.860]  Whole new tax layer, they're rolling out all these new ones because you'd have to pay 100%
[49:49.860 --> 49:54.620]  of your earnings forever to even pay the interest on the trillions that have been created out
[49:54.620 --> 49:56.740]  of nothing, the debt.
[49:56.740 --> 49:58.340]  There's no way to ever pay it back.
[49:58.340 --> 50:01.620]  You can either say this debt's fraudulent, this government's criminal, or we can just
[50:01.620 --> 50:02.820]  all be completely bankrupt.
[50:02.820 --> 50:06.940]  And I know they gave you a black mask to feel powerful, you're gonna decide to be a slave.
[50:06.940 --> 50:08.980]  I understand you're in control, aren't you?
[50:08.980 --> 50:12.300]  Go ahead and take the inoculation lineup, they care about you, don't listen to the
[50:12.300 --> 50:14.900]  nut Alex Jones.
[50:14.900 --> 50:20.020]  Democrats propose taxes to fund veterans' benefits, inflation pressures ease despite
[50:20.020 --> 50:21.580]  food price jump.
[50:21.580 --> 50:24.700]  AP Federal Reserve says inflation's down.
[50:24.700 --> 50:31.900]  You've seen prices going down, Federal Reserve, inflation's down.
[50:31.900 --> 50:35.740]  And I'm a spotted Easter Bunny.
[50:35.740 --> 50:42.060]  New storm headed towards Cyclone devastated Burma, oh, I'm sorry, the military dictatorship,
[50:42.060 --> 50:48.620]  I have to call it Myanmar, China bloggers cook up conspiracies, we'll take some calls,

[52:54.260 --> 52:59.300]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[52:59.300 --> 53:04.100]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[53:04.100 --> 53:09.060]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[53:09.060 --> 53:11.580]  that can alert you that something is wrong.

[53:16.100 --> 53:17.100]  across America.
[53:17.100 --> 53:21.100]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[53:21.100 --> 53:24.780]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[53:24.780 --> 53:25.780]  healthier I feel.
[53:25.780 --> 53:28.420]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[53:28.420 --> 53:33.620]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative

[53:59.580 --> 54:08.860]  I'm going to let them march into body scanners to have 360 images of your neck and family
[54:08.860 --> 54:12.420]  on their database, going to let them pick your baby's blood at birth saying they own
[54:12.420 --> 54:19.780]  your family's DNA, going to let them let private corporations come buy up your politicians
[54:19.780 --> 54:24.300]  and then quadruple the price of your water just to start, going to let them squeeze and
[54:24.300 --> 54:27.180]  have their way with you.
[54:27.180 --> 54:30.820]  By the way, these private water districts once they incorporate, they hire their own
[54:30.820 --> 54:31.820]  police.
[54:31.820 --> 54:37.660]  An example of that is LCRA, private corporation, non-governmental SWAT teams pulling people
[54:37.660 --> 54:44.220]  over, arresting NFL football players who beg and plead, just having their way, just having
[54:44.220 --> 54:48.260]  their way, having their way, having their way.
[54:48.260 --> 54:55.900]  It's all about getting the slaves, all about having their way, all about being a big man,
[54:55.900 --> 55:00.780]  all about enforcing for the masters, all about taking your water, taking your food, all about
[55:00.780 --> 55:05.540]  controlling you, all about taking your future.
[55:05.540 --> 55:09.700]  Steve in Chicago, by the way Wayne Madsen has been harassed.
[55:09.700 --> 55:14.020]  Wayne Madsen for the DCMadam situation, we're having him pop in, big developments there
[55:14.020 --> 55:16.540]  up on infowars.com right now.
[55:16.540 --> 55:18.660]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air.
[55:18.660 --> 55:24.060]  Yes, I'd like to say a big congratulations to the West Virginians for beating back a
[55:24.060 --> 55:26.380]  marauding, grand-paging black beast.
[55:26.380 --> 55:31.900]  Now, I don't know if you saw this, but oh yes, wait a minute, J. Rockefeller, J. Rockefeller
[55:31.900 --> 55:39.660]  was on stage, it's on YouTube, back Lee West Virginia, endorsing Obama.
[55:39.660 --> 55:46.740]  It's obviously a University of Chicago deep cover operation, and I think I want to take
[55:46.740 --> 55:53.900]  one second to say, I'd like to have a celebratory victory dance with the VA, a West Virginia
[55:53.900 --> 55:57.860]  mountain mama.
[55:57.860 --> 56:02.900]  I appreciate your call, sir, I just can't hear the music you're playing.
[56:02.900 --> 56:05.780]  We don't need to call people black beast.
[56:05.780 --> 56:09.380]  We don't need to play into the tribalism they use to control us.
[56:09.380 --> 56:14.300]  Barack Obama is bad, Hillary is bad, McCain is bad.
[56:14.300 --> 56:17.860]  I mean, I hear even all the Patriot talk shows do nothing but cover this election.
[56:17.860 --> 56:19.940]  It doesn't matter.
[56:19.940 --> 56:21.740]  It's a joke, it's a fraud.
[56:21.740 --> 56:26.180]  The only real candidate is Ron Paul, and he's done a great job educating people and probably
[56:26.180 --> 56:29.340]  going to speak at the convention, and there's going to be a big revolt that will bring a
[56:29.340 --> 56:32.980]  lot of attention to what's happening, and I'm all for a revolt, as long as there isn't
[56:32.980 --> 56:35.580]  a quote claim that he's the nominee.
[56:35.580 --> 56:38.980]  Unless McCain gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar in the time, I just don't think
[56:38.980 --> 56:42.700]  you'd see the establishment then push Ron Paul before, they're going to bring in Mitt
[56:42.700 --> 56:43.700]  Romney then.
[56:43.700 --> 56:45.100]  Has anybody thought about that?
[56:45.100 --> 56:48.660]  They're going to bring in folks that have the most delegates after McCain, if that magic
[56:48.660 --> 56:50.220]  scenario happened to happen.
[56:50.220 --> 56:52.900]  I'm just being realistic here.
[56:52.900 --> 56:56.260]  But Steve, I know a lot of people are really hyped up here.
[56:56.260 --> 56:58.220]  It's all staged, okay?
[56:58.220 --> 56:59.380]  They're all in on it.
[56:59.380 --> 57:03.100]  Barack Obama and Hillary, they're going to end up running together, probably, and then
[57:03.100 --> 57:06.580]  you are going to, what's going to happen then?
[57:06.580 --> 57:08.740]  You're actually saluting Hillary Clinton.
[57:08.740 --> 57:13.940]  Oh my gosh, Elias in Ohio, go ahead.
[57:13.940 --> 57:14.940]  Hello.
[57:14.940 --> 57:15.940]  Hi.
[57:15.940 --> 57:16.940]  Hi, Alex.
[57:16.940 --> 57:20.460]  I'm so happy to get on your show.
[57:20.460 --> 57:22.340]  Well, I'm happy to speak to you.
[57:22.340 --> 57:23.340]  What's on your mind?
[57:23.340 --> 57:28.660]  I wanted to ask a question about 9-Eleven.
[57:28.660 --> 57:34.020]  And I was looking at some of the things you guys, one of the programs you guys had on
[57:34.020 --> 57:38.940]  YouTube, and it was talking about drone planes going into the buildings.
[57:38.940 --> 57:45.100]  Okay, if that was so, then where are the people that were on the original planes that
[57:45.100 --> 57:47.220]  had been going to the buildings?
[57:47.220 --> 57:49.500]  Okay, you're saying one of my programs.
[57:49.500 --> 57:53.100]  Do you know what, was it one of my films or someone else's?
[57:53.100 --> 57:54.100]  It was one, no.
[57:54.100 --> 58:00.260]  Maybe it was the guy that you have on that does the investigation, the young guy that
[58:00.260 --> 58:02.660]  you have filling in on for you.
[58:02.660 --> 58:03.660]  Jason Burnness.
[58:03.660 --> 58:04.660]  Yeah.
[58:04.660 --> 58:07.100]  I think I saw it on one of his YouTube programs.
[58:07.100 --> 58:11.020]  Yeah, tell you what, stay there and I'll try to answer this on the other side.
[58:11.020 --> 58:14.940]  I mean, to go ahead and answer some of it, then we'll get David Smyth on it to get after.
[58:14.940 --> 58:22.060]  To answer some of your question now, it is not up to us to prove what happened.
[58:22.060 --> 58:26.020]  We know the official story is a lie and a fraud, we've proven they're lying.
[58:26.020 --> 58:35.300]  Okay, we'll be right back and I'll try to elaborate on this.
[58:35.300 --> 58:48.300]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:48.300 --> 58:52.260]  It is a big idea, a new world order, in the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[58:52.260 --> 58:53.260]  world government.
[58:53.260 --> 58:59.060]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[58:59.060 --> 59:02.220]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.220 --> 59:07.220]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[59:07.220 --> 59:10.580]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:10.580 --> 59:18.020]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.020 --> 59:21.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:21.900 --> 59:24.580]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.580 --> 59:27.700]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[59:27.700 --> 59:28.700]  They're after power.
[59:28.700 --> 59:29.700]  That's their after easy.

[1:00:22.700 --> 1:00:30.980]  Wayne Madsen has been harassed by the federalies for exposing the DC Madame situation.
[1:00:30.980 --> 1:00:32.860]  We'll have him popping in later.
[1:00:32.860 --> 1:00:34.860]  A lot more.
[1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:39.180]  She was asking, you know, if we're surmising that they took control of the aircraft by
[1:00:39.180 --> 1:00:45.780]  remote control, then what do they do with the other passengers?
[1:00:45.780 --> 1:00:49.420]  I believe that it was the aircraft.
[1:00:49.420 --> 1:00:54.540]  I believe that the passengers were on board, and I believe because of what I've been told
[1:00:54.540 --> 1:00:58.740]  from inside sources and what some of the real phone calls from air phones said, not the
[1:00:58.740 --> 1:01:03.540]  fake calls 30,000 feet from regular cell phones are impossible, that I can't breathe.
[1:01:03.540 --> 1:01:04.940]  There's some kind of gas in the cabin.
[1:01:04.940 --> 1:01:05.940]  There's a smoke.
[1:01:05.940 --> 1:01:06.940]  Help me.
[1:01:06.940 --> 1:01:11.820]  You know, there were several calls saying that, and hundreds of other points and data.
[1:01:11.820 --> 1:01:16.860]  You know, when you study something for years, pour over it, study other operations, look
[1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:18.980]  at what they've done.
[1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:27.100]  Look at their technologies, how the computers quote malfunction on a day with 85% plus bookings
[1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:33.420]  on the flights, but on the east coast, but these flights were all at exactly 22% booking,
[1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:36.940]  and then how the hijackers' names weren't on the manifest and later were, and all the
[1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:41.580]  planting of evidence and their bags getting stuck at the airport and leaving their cars
[1:01:41.580 --> 1:01:45.900]  parked with all these admissions in it and the passport floating down magically out of
[1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:49.540]  the sky when the black boxes were destroyed, then the firefighters saying they found the
[1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:51.700]  black boxes were ordered to turn them in and shut up.
[1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:56.440]  I mean, on and on and on, but we know they're lying about the official story.
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:01:58.580]  We have the pieces, so we know they did it.
[1:01:58.580 --> 1:02:01.260]  The question is, I mean, we can say, why did Building 7 blow up?
[1:02:01.260 --> 1:02:07.140]  You know, at 5, 25 in the afternoon, eight hours later after the others fell.
[1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:13.140]  Was Flight 93 that went down into Shanksville, was it going there?
[1:02:13.140 --> 1:02:16.260]  Was it going to be the next, you know, the third building to be hit?
[1:02:16.260 --> 1:02:20.780]  All built as a media spectacle, as the first plane hits, everybody tunes in, second plane
[1:02:20.780 --> 1:02:27.660]  hits, the whole world tunes in, third plane hits, you know, pandemonium, three's the charm.
[1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:31.420]  Did the happy hooligans out of North Dakota stationed in Virginia for the drill?
[1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:32.940]  Did they not follow orders and shoot it down?
[1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:34.020]  We were told that.
[1:02:34.020 --> 1:02:36.700]  We know there was an award ceremony, a lot of evidence there.
[1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:38.180]  We even know the name of the pilot.
[1:02:38.180 --> 1:02:41.620]  Did that stop that plane from going to 7 or was it really going to the Capitol where they
[1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.820]  ordered stand down by the air defenses?
[1:02:44.820 --> 1:02:46.740]  Were they really have had martial law to hit the Capitol?
[1:02:46.740 --> 1:02:50.700]  I don't know.
[1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.100]  But we know they're lying.
[1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:54.100]  That's the point.
[1:02:54.100 --> 1:02:58.540]  We know if we go look at their story, we can then prove it's all a lie, and then they're
[1:02:58.540 --> 1:03:02.300]  covering up, and then they have the motive, then they stage other attacks before they
[1:03:02.300 --> 1:03:06.180]  admit they've staged, and then you add in all the other evidence, and then you know
[1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:07.860]  it's them as an investigator.
[1:03:07.860 --> 1:03:09.260]  Does that answer your question?
[1:03:09.260 --> 1:03:12.580]  Yes, I believe that they did it.
[1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:13.580]  Don't get me wrong.
[1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:18.900]  That was just something that had caught my attention, and I was like, wow, what kind
[1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:22.420]  of things does it take to do something like that?
[1:03:22.420 --> 1:03:26.340]  I mean, what kind of technology, and what do they do with those poor people?
[1:03:26.340 --> 1:03:29.260]  But I believe that it happened the way it did.
[1:03:29.260 --> 1:03:38.180]  Well, Joe Kennedy Jr. in 1943 was flying in a P-38 Lightning, I believe, in a chase plane
[1:03:38.180 --> 1:03:43.300]  behind a B-17 drone cruise missile.
[1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:48.300]  They loaded the B-17 full of explosives, you can look up the case on Wikipedia if you want,
[1:03:48.300 --> 1:03:52.900]  and he died a secret mission, they just declassified it about 10 years ago, and he was chasing
[1:03:52.900 --> 1:03:54.300]  it remote controlling it.
[1:03:54.300 --> 1:03:58.380]  The Germans weren't the only ones, it's just that he had to stay within a few miles
[1:03:58.380 --> 1:04:04.740]  of it, and the German folk wolves and Messerschmitts came up and got him, but he was flying behind
[1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:06.300]  an attack drone then.
[1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:12.300]  They had remote control in 1943, and they were landing jumbo jets and having them fly across
[1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:19.220]  the world from Los Angeles to Australia 30 years ago.
[1:04:19.220 --> 1:04:25.500]  I mean, they fly the space shuttle in by remote control.
[1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:27.340]  They fly cruise missiles through people's windows.
[1:04:27.340 --> 1:04:31.220]  Have you ever seen the video from the cruise missiles radioing it back where they fly through
[1:04:31.220 --> 1:04:32.820]  the window or down the chimney?
[1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:33.820]  Right.
[1:04:33.820 --> 1:04:40.740]  I've seen stuff like that, and it's just, I mean, it's just, I'm just so upset here,
[1:04:40.740 --> 1:04:44.260]  I'm so angry that this is all that's going on, and I was listening to you earlier.
[1:04:44.260 --> 1:04:51.260]  Stay there, I'm going to finish up with you, David J. Smith, coming up, stay with us.

[1:08:38.300 --> 1:08:45.660]  I just wanted to say that I am just, as you were saying earlier, I am so hurt and just
[1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:53.660]  so devastated as to where our nation is going, and I look, I do, as you do sometimes when
[1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:58.780]  I'm driving home or I'm going somewhere and I just look out of my sunroof in my car and
[1:08:58.780 --> 1:09:04.700]  I just think about how beautiful the earth is and our children and the animals and how
[1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:06.700]  it's just going to all be destroyed.
[1:09:06.700 --> 1:09:12.380]  And I just hope and pray that God will bless us, we will, some of us fighters out here,
[1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:16.700]  because I am trying to fight with you guys against the new world order.
[1:09:16.700 --> 1:09:22.100]  I am trying to wake up people, I talk to my family, my friends, people at my job, and
[1:09:22.100 --> 1:09:25.940]  I just hope that the Lord blesses us, that we can come together and that we can defeat
[1:09:25.940 --> 1:09:33.180]  them before anything else happens or, I mean, they've done it's worth, you know, to us as,
[1:09:33.180 --> 1:09:37.420]  you know, they could do, you know, with the vaccinations and, you know, the water and
[1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:40.620]  the fluoride, I mean, just everything.
[1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:44.420]  It's unspeakable how many fronts they're hitting us on, God bless you, and I appreciate
[1:09:44.420 --> 1:09:45.420]  you calling us.
[1:09:45.420 --> 1:09:48.660]  In fact, we'll continue with calls later in this hour and they'll be with us a little
[1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:49.980]  bit in the next hour.
[1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:56.860]  I'm trying to get the young pastor on who's getting his second degree at a East Texas
[1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:02.180]  Bible school there outside Mount Vernon, where he told a group of Boy Scouts, he works
[1:10:02.180 --> 1:10:06.820]  in the office part time, he has to give them tours about how they need to defend the Bill
[1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:10.940]  of Rights Constitution, same thing, he was taught in Boy Scouts, pretty mild stuff, Homeland
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:16.180]  Security showed up, said that is inciting people to terrorism, you can't teach the
[1:10:16.180 --> 1:10:20.620]  Bill of Rights, next time you'll be arrested.
[1:10:20.620 --> 1:10:23.660]  Now that would be hard to believe if I didn't have footage in road to tyranny out of their
[1:10:23.660 --> 1:10:25.300]  own squad car.
[1:10:25.300 --> 1:10:29.100]  The state police at a checkpoint and Abbey Newman pulls up and you see all these cars
[1:10:29.100 --> 1:10:33.820]  lined up and you can see the camera from the squad car, a couple other squad cars in front
[1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:37.660]  of it and it's just a random checkpoint in the middle of nowhere.
[1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:41.300]  So there's only about four cars ahead of her and they come over to the car and they say,
[1:10:41.300 --> 1:10:46.340]  we want to search the car, we want to tell us who you are and she said, listen, this
[1:10:46.340 --> 1:10:50.220]  is a random checkpoint, you don't have probable cause, they say get out of the car, so she
[1:10:50.220 --> 1:10:54.140]  gets out, she doesn't resist, they charge her with resisting and she was found not guilty
[1:10:54.140 --> 1:11:00.820]  for that by a jury because of their squad car video, but again, resisting is not following
[1:11:00.820 --> 1:11:05.140]  their orders now, they throw felonies on you for that, no conscience, then they get in
[1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:09.940]  the back and they find a Patriot Games VHS video, she likes Harrison Ford, she's a married,
[1:11:09.940 --> 1:11:16.020]  retired out of the Navy lady going into town for canning supplies, as I said, very al-Qaidaish
[1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:21.340]  and she's there and they get in the back of the car and they go, my gosh, look at all
[1:11:21.340 --> 1:11:27.380]  this paraphernalia and they go, what is it, he goes, Patriot Games, watch a movie, Alex
[1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:34.100]  Jones, police state 2000, wait a minute, what's this pocket constitution, is that legal, is
[1:11:34.100 --> 1:11:38.460]  that legal and they start going, I don't know, you're allowed to have a constant, folks,
[1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:45.260]  it's on video, it's on video, it's so amazing to a normal person or someone who has any
[1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:50.540]  in education or knows, I mean, this, they've sworn oaths to it, then we have FEMA in Kansas
[1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.500]  City saying the founding fathers are terrorists, the FBI training manual saying and then flyers
[1:11:55.500 --> 1:12:01.340]  to police, call the police if somebody's got a UN bumper sticker, get us out of the UN,
[1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:07.860]  go ahead and arrest them, that's in law enforcement magazines and a lot of cops listening, you've
[1:12:07.860 --> 1:12:10.540]  been exposed to this, I mean, this is incredible.
[1:12:10.540 --> 1:12:15.660]  So I wanted to bring Pastor David J. Smith up about this because now, two years ago,
[1:12:15.660 --> 1:12:19.700]  we had a pastor in Pennsylvania, then one in Ohio, Pastor Butch Paul here on the network
[1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:25.980]  covered it, we brought it out to a big audience here, but he broke it, we got the documents,
[1:12:25.980 --> 1:12:29.380]  we posted them, Butch broke it, we got the documents, given credit where credit's due,
[1:12:29.380 --> 1:12:32.500]  we put the documents up with the blacked out name of the preacher, they still knew who
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:37.300]  it was and went after him and threatened him, he has a big church, kicked him out of the
[1:12:37.300 --> 1:12:43.060]  hospital or for free, he went and was a chaplain for those dying and they told them, we're
[1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:48.060]  going to train folks to get our turn in their guns, have their children taken, go to camps,
[1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:53.020]  go to labor camps and then we put the documents up and people didn't believe it, then a year
[1:12:53.020 --> 1:13:00.180]  plus later, local news and other news outlets, NBC and others reported, but they said it
[1:13:00.180 --> 1:13:04.300]  was good, people say, well, you report mainstream media, they're a bunch of liars, you know,
[1:13:04.300 --> 1:13:09.780]  what are you, why are you quoting them? No, no, no, most of the time they tell the truth,
[1:13:09.780 --> 1:13:14.420]  they just put a spin on it, that it's good and they said martial law is good and they
[1:13:14.420 --> 1:13:19.420]  have the pastor going, do what the government says and we now bring you to pastor David
[1:13:19.420 --> 1:13:23.980]  J. Smith to talk about that, Romans 13, all of it, pastor, thank you for coming on with
[1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:24.980]  us.
[1:13:24.980 --> 1:13:26.940]  It's my pleasure, Alex.
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:31.700]  Just tell us a little bit about yourself first, News Watch Magazine, the website, everything
[1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:35.180]  you do a little bit and then get into your take on what's happening.
[1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:42.220]  Okay, we started News Watch Magazine in August of 1980, that was the first issue we've published
[1:13:42.220 --> 1:13:47.860]  ever since and we watch world news in the light of Bible prophecy.
[1:13:47.860 --> 1:13:53.580]  We talk about a lot of the same things that you do except we give scripture from the Bible
[1:13:53.580 --> 1:14:01.260]  showing how this is rising and how it's going to affect us, whom it's going to affect and
[1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:07.420]  so anyway, we've done this for years, we were on radio from 1982 all the way through to
[1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:13.300]  about four years ago and now we have television programs that we rotate all across the country
[1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:20.380]  and we're on Direct TV, Central Standard Time on Channel 367, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
[1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:28.380]  night at 11 p.m. and we talk about the same things.
[1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:33.420]  For those who are listening to your program and who have not responded before, this is
[1:14:33.420 --> 1:14:40.060]  a one-time offer, we would offer you a one-year free subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[1:14:40.060 --> 1:14:46.860]  All they would have to do would be to call our toll-free number 800-516-8736.
[1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:52.860]  Okay, now what do you want to talk about?
[1:14:52.860 --> 1:15:01.580]  Well, I want your take on the 26,000 preachers recruited to train their flocks to go to FEMA
[1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:03.100]  camps, turn their guns in.
[1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:08.420]  I mean, this is so diametrically opposed to our republic.
[1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:12.500]  Basically the points I was making before I went to you in the last minute or two.
[1:15:12.500 --> 1:15:20.300]  Okay, basically we were founded as a Christian nation and those in the liberal media, they
[1:15:20.300 --> 1:15:23.980]  will try to deny it until the cows come home, but they can't do it.
[1:15:23.980 --> 1:15:30.300]  It's in all the documents that we have, every single state within the United States, all
[1:15:30.300 --> 1:15:36.420]  of the preembles, all of the constitutions, all of our forefathers said that this is a
[1:15:36.420 --> 1:15:38.020]  Christian nation.
[1:15:38.020 --> 1:15:44.700]  Therefore, we were founded upon Christian beliefs, better known as the Ten Commandments.
[1:15:44.700 --> 1:15:50.780]  They gave us a bill of rights because they saw what was happening in Europe.
[1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:56.700]  There was a church and state combination, and the state would follow the direction of
[1:15:56.700 --> 1:16:04.300]  this church, and anyone who did not agree with what was going on, then they were persecuted.
[1:16:04.300 --> 1:16:11.340]  Our government wanted to make sure that we had a, that no church, single church organization
[1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:16.420]  would gain control and be able to have that massive power.
[1:16:16.420 --> 1:16:21.580]  They also saw that in every case, they would always disarm the people, and therefore they
[1:16:21.580 --> 1:16:25.180]  had no way to stand up for their rights.
[1:16:25.180 --> 1:16:28.820]  That's why they put the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
[1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:33.380]  The First Amendment, the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and so on, because they
[1:16:33.380 --> 1:16:41.900]  had no regress of their grievances before kings, and so our entire Constitution was
[1:16:41.900 --> 1:16:48.300]  built for what was going on at that time, and the way that they were going to sever
[1:16:48.300 --> 1:16:54.140]  those relationships with Europe and create a free society.
[1:16:54.140 --> 1:17:02.500]  Now, unfortunately, our Constitution was written in such a way that a Mr. Charles Merriman,
[1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:08.820]  back in the 1930s, was hired by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to change the Constitution
[1:17:08.820 --> 1:17:16.300]  to a democracy, and he said that our Constitution was loosely written, and they could create
[1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:23.940]  court cases to interpret it, and they would change it to a socialized government.
[1:17:23.940 --> 1:17:25.740]  And that's exactly what's happened.
[1:17:25.740 --> 1:17:33.220]  Now, every socialized government, when you read Marxism, and Leninism, and so on, you'll
[1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:39.900]  find that their first step is socialism, and in order to go on to the Communist man, you
[1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:49.740]  have to go and create a dictatorship, eliminate the weak people, the resistors, and then supposedly
[1:17:49.740 --> 1:17:53.140]  the state will wither away over a period of time.
[1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:56.420]  Now, that's nothing but a hoax.
[1:17:56.420 --> 1:18:02.240]  There has not been one single communist country, and communism was founded by the international
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:12.700]  bankers who are wanting to set up a one-world economic system, no coins, no cash, no checks,
[1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:19.020]  only a mart or a chip, so that you can run it across a scanner, and they can control you
[1:18:19.020 --> 1:18:20.020]  that way.
[1:18:20.020 --> 1:18:23.980]  And the way people aren't Christians and don't believe this, it doesn't matter, because
[1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:28.140]  they're announcing they're going to face scan everybody when you buy and sell to stop people
[1:18:28.140 --> 1:18:31.540]  from quote-buying cigarettes and beer, see, that's their excuse.
[1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:36.180]  The cashless grid is going in whether you deny it or not, folks, it's happening.
[1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:42.980]  That's right, and they always come up with a logical reason that is acceptable by people
[1:18:42.980 --> 1:18:47.900]  as to why they're implementing a program, but they always carry it the second and the
[1:18:47.900 --> 1:18:56.900]  third step until finally they reach the conclusion they want, a more solid police state.
[1:18:56.900 --> 1:19:01.340]  And that's what's happening with this young man and all of these ministers.
[1:19:01.340 --> 1:19:06.420]  They've been visited, they've been talked to about telling the people that they should
[1:19:06.420 --> 1:19:08.580]  obey the government at all costs.
[1:19:08.580 --> 1:19:12.420]  Well, that's not what he says in Romans 13.
[1:19:12.420 --> 1:19:19.500]  Romans 13 of the Bible does say that you should get along and you should follow the laws of
[1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:27.940]  the nation as long as those laws don't violate God's laws, or as long as there are not usurpers
[1:19:27.940 --> 1:19:32.740]  of the legitimate government, then you are to obey it.
[1:19:32.740 --> 1:19:36.660]  Our legitimate government is a constitutional republic.
[1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:42.900]  Stay there, I want to come back after the break with David J. Smith and get into this
[1:19:42.900 --> 1:19:51.500]  and get more into Romans 13.
[1:19:51.500 --> 1:19:55.820]  U.S. Civil Flags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every
[1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:59.980]  man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty
[1:19:59.980 --> 1:20:01.780]  and the pursuit of happiness.
[1:20:01.780 --> 1:20:07.660]  The sovereign civil flag is available at U.S.CivilFlags.org and is a symbol of our desire to return
[1:20:07.660 --> 1:20:10.900]  America to the dreams that our forefathers envisioned.

[1:20:56.380 --> 1:21:00.380]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:06.380]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[1:21:06.380 --> 1:21:09.540]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:15.460]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:19.900]  of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:19.900 --> 1:21:25.380]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:21:29.300 --> 1:21:31.940]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:21:31.940 --> 1:21:35.100]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:36.100]  they're after power.
[1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:37.100]  That's their opportunity.

[1:23:00.100 --> 1:23:04.780]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the
[1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:09.460]  US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary
[1:23:09.460 --> 1:23:14.300]  responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice, all nations will participate
[1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:16.540]  since they reside the world over.
[1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:20.940]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:23:20.940 --> 1:23:23.700]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:23:23.700 --> 1:23:28.220]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built
[1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:32.900]  over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning
[1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:37.900]  of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority
[1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:40.220]  that has now been delegated to us.

[1:23:48.300 --> 1:24:15.300]  message of his kingdom.
[1:24:15.300 --> 1:24:33.460]  Pastor David J. Smith continued, I mean the whole Bible, and even if people aren't Christians
[1:24:33.460 --> 1:24:38.380]  out there, they need to understand that the government is going, taking over the churches,
[1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:42.180]  using religion, using Christians, but not just Christianity, they're infiltrating all
[1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:46.540]  the major religions and telling them worship the government, do what they say, turn your
[1:24:46.540 --> 1:24:47.540]  guns in.
[1:24:47.540 --> 1:24:51.580]  We have the documents, it's now been in the news, it's so diabolical and they tell them
[1:24:51.580 --> 1:24:56.740]  render unto Caesar when all of the disciples were killed for not following orders, when
[1:24:56.740 --> 1:25:00.580]  Jesus went into the money changers, when he wouldn't bow to government, when the prophets
[1:25:00.580 --> 1:25:04.820]  were always rebuking the government, and then they twist it and say, no, you've got to worship
[1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:06.580]  the government, all authorities of God.
[1:25:06.580 --> 1:25:10.540]  Well, wait a minute then, so the founding fathers were bad fighting England, or we were
[1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:16.980]  bad to fight Hitler because Hitler was authority, so he was of God, it is so sick, and then
[1:25:16.980 --> 1:25:22.700]  now, Pastor David J. Smith, the on the face of it, the tyranny of the government having
[1:25:22.700 --> 1:25:29.900]  a relationship secretly with the pastors, I mean that's right out of the Soviet Union.
[1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:36.860]  It absolutely is, and not only that, there's a lot more in depth to this, and I don't know
[1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:42.180]  sometimes whether to even bring it up or not, but I guess if we're looking for truth, we
[1:25:42.180 --> 1:25:45.180]  better say it.
[1:25:45.180 --> 1:25:52.420]  Jesuit universities, there are Jesuits who, as the society of Jesus, and from the Catholic
[1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:58.340]  church, they go out into organizations, even though they're priests, they dress just like
[1:25:58.340 --> 1:26:04.620]  the average person, and filtrate organizations, the Knights of Malta, and their goal is to
[1:26:04.620 --> 1:26:08.500]  bring everybody in the world back to the Catholic church.
[1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:13.340]  There's 24 organizations, minimum, working inside the United Nations to bring them out
[1:26:13.340 --> 1:26:16.100]  of one world religion.
[1:26:16.100 --> 1:26:21.700]  In Clayton, Missouri, there's a United Nations library, and when I lived in St. Louis, I
[1:26:21.700 --> 1:26:29.140]  went to it, and in one of the books by Dag Hammershaw, he said that the head of the United
[1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:35.580]  Nations would be the political party for the world when they established their world government,
[1:26:35.580 --> 1:26:41.260]  but then there would be a religious party of Rome, and so once again, church and state
[1:26:41.260 --> 1:26:48.660]  together, and so they're trying to bring a ecumenical movement here of all churches,
[1:26:48.660 --> 1:26:53.980]  and a part of it is this going in and talking with the pastors, telling them that guns are
[1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:58.380]  bad, they're evil, they should be willing to turn them in.
[1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:08.300]  And all of this is from a program written paper by Major Peters, and he put it, it was
[1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:10.540]  called Warrior Class.
[1:27:10.540 --> 1:27:17.340]  He said that patriots and those who would hold out for nationalism, who believed in God
[1:27:17.340 --> 1:27:25.420]  and the Bible, were now to be considered an enemy doctrine, and therefore anybody that
[1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:31.060]  holds out and wants America to remain free and outside the New World Order, anybody that
[1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:40.820]  wants to have a free reign of Christianity in America, they are the enemies.
[1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:44.260]  Any patriot is the enemy.
[1:27:44.260 --> 1:27:53.420]  Now, our government may not come out and say that, but they've shown it by court cases.
[1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:59.980]  We know they have these prison camps, Rex 84 under the Ronald Reagan administration built
[1:27:59.980 --> 1:28:00.980]  them.
[1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:06.740]  Well, now it's in the Houston Chronicle, now it's admitted all over the news.
[1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:13.300]  Right, and in 19, oh, I forget what year it was, but anyway, there was a court case in
[1:28:13.300 --> 1:28:21.100]  Houston, Texas, and a man sued the government because of this Rex 84 program, and the court
[1:28:21.100 --> 1:28:26.540]  said, you haven't been in prison and nobody else has, and you haven't been harmed by it,
[1:28:26.540 --> 1:28:32.060]  so we're going to throw your case out of court.
[1:28:32.060 --> 1:28:38.420]  They did say, in a footnote at the end of it, you have proven your case that there are
[1:28:38.420 --> 1:28:47.300]  civilian prison camps built in America, but since you haven't been harmed, then your case
[1:28:47.300 --> 1:28:48.300]  is dismissed.
[1:28:48.300 --> 1:28:50.220]  That's right, you don't have standing.
[1:28:50.220 --> 1:28:51.220]  That's right.
[1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:57.740]  But going back, that was then, this is now, it's all admitted, I mean, if you read PD-51
[1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:01.660]  or you read the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, it says the president's dictator, that
[1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:06.380]  means Hillary, Obama, McCain, whoever's coming, Bush, they're just puppets, people need to
[1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:11.780]  understand, it's not just about the personality, it moves on, and it says it's for insurrection,
[1:29:11.780 --> 1:29:13.060]  it's to fight the American people.
[1:29:13.060 --> 1:29:17.060]  I want you to talk about that when we get back, and I want to hear more about these Jesuits.
[1:29:17.060 --> 1:29:23.340]  On the other side with Pastor David J. Smith, just an amazing researcher, and we'll talk
[1:29:23.340 --> 1:29:28.140]  about, since he brings this up, Tony Blair converting to the Catholicism to be the new
[1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:41.580]  EU head, we'll be right back.
[1:29:41.580 --> 1:29:45.340]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:45.340 --> 1:29:51.540]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:56.180]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:29:56.180 --> 1:30:00.940]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:30:00.940 --> 1:30:02.700]  Hi, folks, Alex Jones here.

[1:30:55.860 --> 1:31:02.060]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely
[1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:04.540]  destroys the official fable forever.
[1:31:04.540 --> 1:31:08.820]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[1:31:08.820 --> 1:31:13.620]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:15.620]  crime are brought to justice.

[1:31:41.300 --> 1:31:42.300]  of other titles.
[1:31:42.300 --> 1:31:45.260]  We're in a no holds bar information war.
[1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:49.660]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:31:49.660 --> 1:31:51.220]  to Big Brother.
[1:31:51.220 --> 1:31:55.460]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[1:31:55.460 --> 1:32:00.260]  alkaline environment, but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic
[1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:02.420]  diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:32:02.420 --> 1:32:06.580]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[1:32:06.580 --> 1:32:07.780]  of disease.
[1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:12.380]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[1:32:12.380 --> 1:32:13.460]  loss of weight.
[1:32:13.460 --> 1:32:18.100]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life, most
[1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:19.700]  people are overly acidic.
[1:32:19.700 --> 1:32:23.620]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:32:23.620 --> 1:32:27.940]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[1:32:27.940 --> 1:32:28.940]  it.
[1:32:28.940 --> 1:32:32.500]  If you drink too much acid, alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:37.140]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[1:32:37.140 --> 1:32:41.180]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:47.580]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[1:32:47.580 --> 1:33:13.580]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[1:33:13.580 --> 1:33:33.180]  We're about to go back to Pastor David J. Smith here in just a moment.
[1:33:33.180 --> 1:33:38.100]  We're going to be up in the phones up later in this hour at 1-800-259-9231.

[1:33:50.460 --> 1:33:52.620]  programs, radio shows for years.
[1:33:52.620 --> 1:33:57.340]  He knows about every subject, a newshound just like myself.
[1:33:57.340 --> 1:34:02.700]  He's been out there just for, since 1980, fighting the New World Order or longer, 28-plus
[1:34:02.700 --> 1:34:03.700]  years.
[1:34:03.700 --> 1:34:05.860]  So we're very, very honored to have him with us.
[1:34:05.860 --> 1:34:07.420]  We're going to go back to him in just a moment.
[1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:12.980]  Don't forget that not only am I a documentary filmmaker, not only do my documentary films
[1:34:12.980 --> 1:34:17.740]  wake people up like none others we've seen out there, your purchase of the books and
[1:34:17.740 --> 1:34:23.820]  videos at our secure online video and bookstore online at infowars.com makes what we do here
[1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:25.420]  possible.
[1:34:25.420 --> 1:34:30.860]  And I'm here working hard for you Monday through Friday for four hours from 11 to 2 p.m. central,
[1:34:30.860 --> 1:34:31.860]  11 to 3 p.m. central.
[1:34:31.860 --> 1:34:36.620]  We just expanded the show about a month ago, and I come in on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:41.740]  the special end of week, start of week, final edition.
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:47.300]  So you can always show me for the final edition, Sundays at 4 to 6 p.m. as well, not just the
[1:34:47.300 --> 1:34:52.420]  weekday show, and so please go to infowars.com.
[1:34:52.420 --> 1:34:58.220]  I mean, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavment is an incredible film, and it's shot in high
[1:34:58.220 --> 1:34:59.220]  definition.
[1:34:59.220 --> 1:35:00.900]  It's so well done.
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:04.340]  The history of the New World Order, who they are, how they operate, what their master plan
[1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:06.140]  is, what they're doing.
[1:35:06.140 --> 1:35:08.780]  None of its rumor, it's all documented fact.
[1:35:08.780 --> 1:35:12.580]  You need to have this two-hour, 20-minute film, 40 minutes of extras.
[1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:17.300]  So it's a three hours on one disc, American Drug War exposing how the government ships
[1:35:17.300 --> 1:35:21.660]  the drugs in, and Hollywood advertises how they're cool, so the kids use them, and they
[1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:24.100]  throw you in prison for using their drugs.
[1:35:24.100 --> 1:35:26.020]  We've got that for $24.95.
[1:35:26.020 --> 1:35:35.340]  It has three hours of extras on it, so that's five hours for $24.95, and it is just got a
[1:35:35.340 --> 1:35:36.980]  buzz all over the country right now.
[1:35:36.980 --> 1:35:44.660]  I consulted on it, I'm in the extras, and American Drug War, of course, is something
[1:35:44.660 --> 1:35:46.580]  that everybody needs to see.
[1:35:46.580 --> 1:35:50.460]  You may know they ship the drugs in, you may know that war on drugs is a fraud, you may
[1:35:50.460 --> 1:35:56.260]  know it's problem-reaction solution, your neighbors, your police chief, your pastor,
[1:35:56.260 --> 1:36:02.340]  your cousins, your boss, your employees, people in the community, they don't know, so get
[1:36:02.340 --> 1:36:06.900]  American Drug War, it's not even out on DVD yet, but I had a deal as consultant to be
[1:36:06.900 --> 1:36:08.540]  able to have it before it even came out.
[1:36:08.540 --> 1:36:14.660]  You can get it one place, infowars.com, and you can get it for $5 cheaper than it's going
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:15.660]  to be selling for.
[1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:20.540]  It's going to be selling for $29.95, we've got $24.95 at infowars.com, we've got Washington

[1:36:34.860 --> 1:36:42.980]  is hurting so many of us, infowars.com, or 888-253-3139, or you can also write to us
[1:36:42.980 --> 1:36:51.900]  at 3001-South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04, and don't forget, all 18 of my films
[1:36:51.900 --> 1:36:57.540]  are online in super-high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv for members, and PrisonPlanet.tv members

[1:37:03.340 --> 1:37:05.740]  document cam, exclusive videos.
[1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:15.140]  We're going to stream sections of my new film, 9-11 Chronicles, Part 1, Truth Rising, we're
[1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:21.140]  going to stream that here first before it's even posted for the main audience at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:37:21.140 --> 1:37:24.660]  We're going to be streaming excerpts of that to give you an idea of why you want to be
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:29.220]  a PrisonPlanet.tv member, and with the added capital and support we will get a bigger office,
[1:37:29.220 --> 1:37:30.220]  more employees.
[1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:35.180]  I'm doing what David J. Smith's doing, I'm going to start a TV show on cable, on the
[1:37:35.180 --> 1:37:40.820]  dish, but it takes capital to do that, so support us by buying the videos and books,
[1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:44.980]  and then make copies of my videos, get them out to peopleinfowars.com.
[1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:47.980]  Going back to Pastor David J. Smith is going to be with us to the bottom of the next hour,
[1:37:47.980 --> 1:37:54.100]  maybe longer, got some other guests popping in later too, continuing sir, because I have
[1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:55.540]  always exposed the Jesuits.
[1:37:55.540 --> 1:38:00.860]  I've had Tex Mars on, I've had a bunch of other guests on over the years, and then some
[1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:05.140]  people have erroneously claimed that I don't talk about the Catholic Church, they've erroneously
[1:38:05.140 --> 1:38:09.460]  claimed because there's a black guy named Alex Jones, that's what got him started on
[1:38:09.460 --> 1:38:10.460]  it.
[1:38:10.460 --> 1:38:15.940]  First, they said I was a Jesuit because they heard there was a Jesuit named Alex Jones,
[1:38:15.940 --> 1:38:19.780]  and then once they'd already accused me, they couldn't say they were wrong, and that's
[1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:23.700]  how the whole thing started about 10 years ago, was there's a black guy who's a Jesuit
[1:38:23.700 --> 1:38:28.820]  named Alex Jones, it doesn't matter, I'm not black guy, I'm not 50-something years old,
[1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:35.060]  but it doesn't matter, I'm guilty, and my whole family's Protestants and famous Protestants
[1:38:35.060 --> 1:38:39.540]  in Texas who raised Colonel Travis's son, but I want you to know, say whatever you want
[1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:45.180]  about the Jesuits, I have to constantly talk about it, Blair kicks off campaign to become
[1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:52.540]  EU president, London Guardian, this was back on January, and it said that what we predicted,
[1:38:52.540 --> 1:38:55.780]  when he converted about eight months ago to Catholicism, we said, watch, he's going to
[1:38:55.780 --> 1:39:01.420]  be the new EU president, because you're right, Rome says that is their political arm, and
[1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:06.780]  rat singer of course, Hitler Youth calling for a world government, but the problem is
[1:39:06.780 --> 1:39:12.580]  I don't hate Catholics, and then I don't exaggerate and lie about your common Catholics, and so
[1:39:12.580 --> 1:39:17.060]  well, I mean, the big thing is this ego maniac sent me an email, I just got a similar one
[1:39:17.060 --> 1:39:20.700]  from somebody else saying, you're going to interview me, or I'm going to expose you,
[1:39:20.700 --> 1:39:24.180]  and if I get a threat like that, I go, well, I'd like to interview you, but a guy just
[1:39:24.180 --> 1:39:27.260]  like yesterday said, you will interview me, I know more than you, I've been around longer
[1:39:27.260 --> 1:39:33.860]  than you, you will interview me, or I am going to talk about about you, knock yourself out,
[1:39:33.860 --> 1:39:38.420]  go ahead and maniacs, but you are real, you're a real researcher, you bring out what you
[1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:43.700]  can prove, and I agree that Jesuits are right at the top of the New World Order, tell us
[1:39:43.700 --> 1:39:44.700]  about them.
[1:39:44.700 --> 1:39:50.980]  Well, Bill Clinton said that his mentor was the late Professor Carol Quigley of Georgetown
[1:39:50.980 --> 1:39:54.980]  University, which is a Jesuit university.
[1:39:54.980 --> 1:40:01.420]  He wrote a huge, huge book, Tragedy and Hope, and in there, he said that he was an insider
[1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:06.940]  for 25 years, he saw their books, he knew their plan, what their purpose was, and he
[1:40:06.940 --> 1:40:13.940]  said the entire world was going to be controlled, from your birth to your death, everything
[1:40:13.940 --> 1:40:15.460]  was going to be controlled.
[1:40:15.460 --> 1:40:20.300]  Well, this is nothing but pure socialism, and then you want to throw in a little fascism
[1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:24.980]  because of the corporate structure that's going to be with this New World Order.
[1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:32.580]  And so, but the thing is, the Jesuits, the Society of Jesus, they and the Knights of
[1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:42.580]  Malta all have sworn allegiance that they are trying to get every sand of grain, of
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:48.820]  sand of, you know, a piece of sand on earth, all landmasses and the people that inhabit
[1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:56.820]  them to turn back to the Catholic Church, and the present Pope actually stated, and
[1:40:56.820 --> 1:41:03.300]  all of us know it if we watch the news, and he said that the Protestants and anybody that
[1:41:03.300 --> 1:41:08.660]  was not a Catholic was defective and doctrine and needed to come back to them.
[1:41:08.660 --> 1:41:18.980]  Well, that's a problem for me because I believe he's the defect, and not the Bible, and that's
[1:41:18.980 --> 1:41:20.980]  what we go by.
[1:41:20.980 --> 1:41:27.500]  And so, the Society of Jesus is working in secret, they go out and infiltrate all types
[1:41:27.500 --> 1:41:36.220]  of businesses, organizations, universities, and so on, and even churches in order to bring
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:39.780]  them back to the Catholic Church.
[1:41:39.780 --> 1:41:47.260]  They try to undermine the virgin birth of Jesus, they try to undermine all biblical
[1:41:47.260 --> 1:41:53.380]  principles and say that they're not true, well, of course, once they've undermined it
[1:41:53.380 --> 1:41:59.180]  and they finally turn people back to the Vatican for a religion, it becomes very easy
[1:41:59.180 --> 1:42:04.740]  because when you look back in history, and I've studied it well, you go back into history
[1:42:04.740 --> 1:42:12.740]  and you start in 321 AD, and you find that the Roman Empire began to change everything
[1:42:12.740 --> 1:42:14.700]  in the Bible.
[1:42:14.700 --> 1:42:21.500]  And then when the Pope became the official, he was called the Pope for the first time
[1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:30.740]  in 610 AD, and then in a few years earlier, 554, he crowned one of the kings, Charlemagne,
[1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:33.700]  I believe, and then it became the Holy Roman Empire.
[1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:37.540]  Yeah, the Roman Empire switched into a religious empire.
[1:42:37.540 --> 1:42:44.660]  Right, but the thing is, in order to convert everybody, they just let them have all the
[1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:50.820]  all of their pagan practices, and then call them by Christian names.
[1:42:50.820 --> 1:42:54.820]  They let them continue to worship their idols, their gods and goddesses.
[1:42:54.820 --> 1:42:59.500]  Well, that's why during World War II, Catholic churches would get bombed, and under the
[1:42:59.500 --> 1:43:04.460]  main altar, there'd be a Druidic sacrificial altar.
[1:43:04.460 --> 1:43:05.460]  It's really wild.
[1:43:05.460 --> 1:43:13.260]  Yeah, they built them on all the original sacrificial laylines and sites and where Druidic
[1:43:13.260 --> 1:43:14.820]  temples had been.
[1:43:14.820 --> 1:43:15.820]  Right.
[1:43:15.820 --> 1:43:20.020]  Now, I want to get into the whole political system with this.
[1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:25.180]  At the very top of the New World Order, because we know David Rockefeller and the UN as well
[1:43:25.180 --> 1:43:29.140]  are pushing the World Council and National Council of Churches, and they're saying you
[1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:33.860]  can have any religion you want, just don't criticize any others, and Oprah wants to start
[1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:39.660]  a church that's all New Agey, and they claim it's this new enlightenment, but you can't
[1:43:39.660 --> 1:43:44.740]  criticize other religions because that's hurtful, and that's the cause of war, and we've got
[1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:49.980]  Walter Cronkite saying that he gets his orders from Satan making a joke and is calling for
[1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:50.980]  world government.
[1:43:50.980 --> 1:43:56.660]  I mean, I know that they are, quote, into the occult, and I don't debate that the Catholic
[1:43:56.660 --> 1:44:02.740]  Church calls for a world government rat singer, and the guy before him, Pope John Paul II,
[1:44:02.740 --> 1:44:08.900]  calling for it and saying all religions are the same, and these giant things in Rome at,
[1:44:08.900 --> 1:44:13.940]  you know, there at the, you know, main Vatican City with hundreds of religious leaders, Druids,
[1:44:13.940 --> 1:44:19.580]  you name it, Shaman, all saying it's the same God, I mean, I don't know how any Catholic
[1:44:19.580 --> 1:44:23.620]  could not read the Bible and say that as good, you know, so I'm not debating when it became
[1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:28.740]  evil or how it's evil, or we just know that it certainly is part of the New World Order.
[1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:33.460]  Would you say at the very, I mean, for me at the very top of the pyramid, it is this
[1:44:33.460 --> 1:44:38.060]  Luciferianism, this mystery religion going back to Egypt, and then they control all the
[1:44:38.060 --> 1:44:39.060]  other major groups.
[1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:44.420]  I mean, it's not even a debate then who runs it, and because we know it's part of it, but
[1:44:44.420 --> 1:44:49.060]  I want you to be able to elaborate, do you believe that the Roman Church is at the penultimate
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:50.060]  tip of the pyramid?
[1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:55.260]  I believe that they are on the religious aspect, the top of the pyramid.
[1:44:55.260 --> 1:45:01.860]  Now, when you stop and look back on the Illuminati, which means illuminated ones, and they believe
[1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:08.860]  that they got their illumination from Lucifer, who rebelled against God and became Satan,
[1:45:08.860 --> 1:45:19.100]  Albert Pike had an ongoing discussion with Lemai, who took over as second after the death
[1:45:19.100 --> 1:45:22.420]  of Adam Weishaupt of the Illuminati.
[1:45:22.420 --> 1:45:29.540]  They wanted, Pike wanted to call him Lucifer, while Lemai wanted to call him Satan, and
[1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:35.660]  so they finally decided upon Lucifer, and they said, we of the higher degrees must maintain
[1:45:35.660 --> 1:45:38.780]  the pure doctrine of Lucifer.
[1:45:38.780 --> 1:45:44.620]  But we can say to those in the 32nd, 31st, 30th degrees known down, that we believe in
[1:45:44.620 --> 1:45:48.820]  a God, just don't tell them which one, and therefore...
[1:45:48.820 --> 1:45:51.860]  And by the way, I want Mason's tuning in to know, we're not saying you're individually
[1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:53.380]  bad, you're deceived.
[1:45:53.380 --> 1:45:58.100]  This is why there are symbols of the pyramid, meaning compartmentalization, you don't know.
[1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:02.820]  So you think the G and the compass is for God, you find out when you're 33rd degree
[1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:08.300]  that it is Lucifer, and Albert Pike wrote books, Manly P. Hall, your top Masons, whose
[1:46:08.300 --> 1:46:13.340]  pictures hang in your halls, they wrote books, so it's not us saying it, it's your grandmasters.
[1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:14.340]  Go ahead.
[1:46:14.340 --> 1:46:23.620]  That's right, and the point I started to make was, you go back to Adam Weishaupt, he taught
[1:46:23.620 --> 1:46:28.460]  at a Jesuit university, Ingolstadt University in Bavaria, Germany.
[1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:36.100]  He became, he said, disillusioned, and he left the Catholic Church and founded the Illuminati.
[1:46:36.100 --> 1:46:41.340]  And yet there were many, many religious people, and even ministers and so on priests that were
[1:46:41.340 --> 1:46:44.100]  a part of the Illuminati.
[1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:48.740]  On his deathbed, he recanted and said, I'm really Catholic.
[1:46:48.740 --> 1:46:54.180]  So is this whole thing that he's created, that has come down to us today, and they're
[1:46:54.180 --> 1:47:00.580]  about to take the world right now, is it really the Jesuits and secret?
[1:47:00.580 --> 1:47:05.260]  And there are many other people that don't realize that they're being used in other
[1:47:05.260 --> 1:47:11.180]  secret societies like Skull and Bones, and the Bohemian Grove, and so on.
[1:47:11.180 --> 1:47:15.740]  Well, we know that the money came from the British East India Company, but the charter,
[1:47:15.740 --> 1:47:22.260]  this is in their own admissions, came from Bavaria, Germany for 1832.
[1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:25.020]  Yep.
[1:47:25.020 --> 1:47:31.300]  And we know that the Rothschilds and other international bankers financed all of this
[1:47:31.300 --> 1:47:33.300]  to get it started.
[1:47:33.300 --> 1:47:37.140]  So how do the Hebrews tie into this then?
[1:47:37.140 --> 1:47:42.140]  Well, see, you've got two different items here.
[1:47:42.140 --> 1:47:48.980]  Number one, there were 12 tribes of Israel, and the northern 10 tribes of Israel split
[1:47:48.980 --> 1:47:56.100]  away from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin because Solomon's son, Rehoboam, would not
[1:47:56.100 --> 1:47:59.180]  give them relief from taxation.
[1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:04.380]  So they rebelled, and they became a separate nation from Judah.
[1:48:04.380 --> 1:48:09.100]  That's found in 1 Kings chapter 11 and 12.
[1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:15.700]  Kings and Acre above Assyria came down in 721-718 BC and captured the northern 10 tribes and
[1:48:15.700 --> 1:48:16.940]  sifted them through the nation.
[1:48:16.940 --> 1:48:19.540]  They lost track of who they were.
[1:48:19.540 --> 1:48:21.100]  So they left only Judah.
[1:48:21.100 --> 1:48:26.300]  They were captured by the Babylonian Empire, King Nebuchadnezzar.
[1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:32.580]  He sent them back only so that the Messiah, Jesus Christ, could be born through them.
[1:48:32.580 --> 1:48:37.540]  But in 70 AD, Jerusalem was destroyed, and they were scattered.
[1:48:37.540 --> 1:48:45.940]  But then, I have a set of Jewish encyclopedias, and it says under the term Kezar that in
[1:48:45.940 --> 1:48:56.260]  740 AD, a group of people from Turkish extract adopted the religion of Judaism.
[1:48:56.260 --> 1:48:58.420]  They're not from the tribe of Judah.
[1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:02.020]  They could not technically be called Jews.
[1:49:02.020 --> 1:49:03.020]  But they do.
[1:49:03.020 --> 1:49:05.900]  They're the house of Rothschilds.
[1:49:05.900 --> 1:49:10.740]  They are descended from Esau, who took the birthright, who Jacob took the birthright away
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:12.240]  from him.
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:18.980]  So here's a group of people hiding behind the cloak of being a Jew, but they're from
[1:49:18.980 --> 1:49:23.420]  Turkey, not the tribe of Judah.
[1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:29.380]  And they're trying to regain the wealth of the world that was given to Jacob.
[1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:33.860]  Well, I've read their own documents, and that's what they believe.
[1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:36.040]  So you're only saying what they're saying.
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:37.540]  Just amazing.
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:44.660]  Now, getting back to the on-the-ground manifestation of this, preachers call me all the time.
[1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:48.620]  I get little news articles here and there, but most of them are afraid to come on.
[1:49:48.620 --> 1:49:49.620]  But again, we have the documents.
[1:49:49.620 --> 1:49:50.620]  It's admitted.
[1:49:50.620 --> 1:49:51.620]  It's been on the news.
[1:49:51.620 --> 1:49:54.300]  I mean, how does a preacher get approached with a government, hey, we want you to tell
[1:49:54.300 --> 1:49:58.940]  your flock to submit to government and go to FEMA camps, and when there's an emergency,
[1:49:58.940 --> 1:50:04.660]  call them to go to the sports stadium and turn their guns in, and then FEMA just leased
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:10.980]  in Des Moines, Iowa, a huge stockyards, the cattle yards, and they admitted for putting
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:11.980]  people in.
[1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:15.380]  I mean, it's a bad Twilight Zone episode.
[1:50:15.380 --> 1:50:16.380]  Right.
[1:50:16.380 --> 1:50:21.780]  And I don't understand why any minister who's worth his salt would stand up.
[1:50:21.780 --> 1:50:25.580]  Well, you know, really, you got to take a break.
[1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:26.580]  Yeah, we do.
[1:50:26.580 --> 1:50:27.580]  Stay there.
[1:50:27.580 --> 1:50:32.580]  Let's talk more about Romans 13, because I've had police tell me they go, it is of the Lord
[1:50:32.580 --> 1:50:33.580]  do whatever I say.
[1:50:33.580 --> 1:50:36.580]  But if that was the case, we'd have had no founding fathers.
[1:50:36.580 --> 1:50:39.420]  I mean, why did Jesus then not follow the government's orders?
[1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:44.940]  I mean, it's just made up, but we have a pastor on with us, David J. Smith as a national television
[1:50:44.940 --> 1:50:50.700]  program as well, three times a week, we'll be talking to him in just a moment.

[1:52:51.900 --> 1:52:56.060]  According to the EPA, our indoor air is many times more polluted than outdoor air.
[1:52:56.060 --> 1:52:58.100]  One child in 10 suffers from asthma.

[1:52:59.860 --> 1:53:03.740]  The answer is clear, Himalayan crystal salt lamps from Ionic salts.

[1:54:12.980 --> 1:54:17.180]  Look, we know there's a New World Order, we know that every major organization is controlled
[1:54:17.180 --> 1:54:22.020]  by the New World Order, all the big institutions.
[1:54:22.020 --> 1:54:23.020]  We know that now.
[1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:27.380]  Let's move on to fighting their program, standing up against it, resisting it.
[1:54:27.380 --> 1:54:31.900]  David J. Smith, you were making a point.
[1:54:31.900 --> 1:54:44.060]  From his 13, it basically states that we are to obey the law unless it requires us to violate
[1:54:44.060 --> 1:54:46.060]  God's law.
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:56.580]  Now, plus, basically, our forefathers gave us a Republican form of government, a Constitution
[1:54:56.580 --> 1:55:01.740]  and a Bill of Rights to protect us from tyranny.
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:08.420]  It was supposed to be our representatives in Washington that would balance the executive
[1:55:08.420 --> 1:55:12.060]  department and then the judiciary.
[1:55:12.060 --> 1:55:14.460]  They would balance each other.
[1:55:14.460 --> 1:55:20.100]  But when the president of the United States and previous presidents have packed the courts
[1:55:20.100 --> 1:55:30.580]  with liberals and they always interpret the law instead of become a strict constitutionalist,
[1:55:30.580 --> 1:55:35.500]  then they're the traitors, not the average American person.
[1:55:35.500 --> 1:55:39.020]  And so they are the ones that should be held accountable.
[1:55:39.020 --> 1:55:40.980]  And I want to be clear here.
[1:55:40.980 --> 1:55:46.460]  On its face, it is so asinine to say worship all authority, do whatever it says, it's all
[1:55:46.460 --> 1:55:47.460]  of God.
[1:55:47.460 --> 1:55:51.180]  And I have a bunch of preachers on national TV I can play clips of, knowing off their
[1:55:51.180 --> 1:55:53.020]  government talking points.
[1:55:53.020 --> 1:55:58.180]  I mean all authority, that means Pol Pot, that means Vlad the Impaler, that means Adolf
[1:55:58.180 --> 1:55:59.620]  Hitler.
[1:55:59.620 --> 1:56:01.460]  That means Mao Zedong.
[1:56:01.460 --> 1:56:04.900]  That means just everybody.
[1:56:04.900 --> 1:56:09.740]  I mean it's King George III, I mean that's to say, then they say our Congress should
[1:56:09.740 --> 1:56:14.260]  do what the president says because he's of God.
[1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:16.100]  But wait, they're co-equal in authority.
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:20.460]  I mean it is such a, and I've read all of that chapter.
[1:56:20.460 --> 1:56:24.780]  They just take Romans 13 out of context, but balanced against the rest of the Bible.
[1:56:24.780 --> 1:56:28.500]  The whole Bible, Old and New Testament is about standing up against tyranny and being
[1:56:28.500 --> 1:56:33.180]  thrown the lion's den, or in a furnace, or being crucified upside down, or having your
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:36.580]  eyeballs poked out, or being burned at the stake.
[1:56:36.580 --> 1:56:39.980]  But no, they say no, it's about doing what you're told.
[1:56:39.980 --> 1:56:47.060]  No, that means that you have nothing but sheep that are led to the slaughter when it should
[1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:48.660]  not be that way.
[1:56:48.660 --> 1:56:56.700]  Now I don't necessarily advocate taking up guns and go around shooting people that are
[1:56:56.700 --> 1:56:57.700]  a part of the government.
[1:56:57.700 --> 1:57:02.220]  Now, only in defense, if they're putting you on FEMA trailers, you can't let them take
[1:57:02.220 --> 1:57:03.220]  your children.
[1:57:03.220 --> 1:57:04.220]  Well, yeah, right.
[1:57:04.220 --> 1:57:09.980]  No, I mean that's it, but don't worry, folks that want to fight, that's coming soon.
[1:57:09.980 --> 1:57:13.860]  So you've been shooting your mouths off, you're probably going to get what you want real soon.
[1:57:13.860 --> 1:57:15.700]  That's right.
[1:57:15.700 --> 1:57:21.260]  But the government of the United States right now, George Bush, has set himself up as a
[1:57:21.260 --> 1:57:22.260]  dictator.
[1:57:22.260 --> 1:57:28.500]  Otherwise, how can you create a North American Union and merge three countries together when
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:32.340]  not the Congress, nor we the people, have voted upon it?
[1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:33.340]  Great point.
[1:57:33.340 --> 1:57:34.420]  Make that, flesh that point out.
[1:57:34.420 --> 1:57:38.500]  That is so huge that Congress isn't even allowed to see the agreements.
[1:57:38.500 --> 1:57:42.820]  Congress can't see the Homeland Security PDDD51 continuity of government.
[1:57:42.820 --> 1:57:45.220]  I mean, this is, we're seeing dictatorship.
[1:57:45.220 --> 1:57:50.660]  Well, that's what it basically is boiled down to, and nobody in Congress has the courage
[1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:58.020]  to stand up to him and say, either we see with our own eyes, these documents, or we're
[1:57:58.020 --> 1:57:59.420]  going to start impeachment.
[1:57:59.420 --> 1:58:04.020]  They won't do it, they don't have the courage to.
[1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:08.220]  And if they'd have done that, just like that did Bill Clinton, because George Bush, in
[1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:14.780]  my opinion, has done more to harm the United States since he's gone into office than Bill
[1:58:14.780 --> 1:58:15.780]  Clinton did.
[1:58:15.780 --> 1:58:19.820]  But you think somebody even worse is on their way.
[1:58:19.820 --> 1:58:23.660]  We'll talk about your take on Barack Obama on the other side, I know you wanted to mention
[1:58:23.660 --> 1:58:24.660]  that.
[1:58:24.660 --> 1:58:33.140]  Also, your phone calls me with us for another 30 minutes, 1-800-2599-231.

[1:58:56.540 --> 1:58:59.700]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:58:59.700 --> 1:59:05.620]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:59:05.620 --> 1:59:13.820]  of humanity is at hand, for the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government

[1:59:22.060 --> 1:59:25.180]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:26.180]  they're after power.
[1:59:26.180 --> 1:59:27.180]  That's their after-easy.

[1:59:44.100 --> 1:59:55.100]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:55.100 --> 1:59:56.500]  Government cover-ups.
[1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:57.500]  You want answers?
[1:59:57.500 --> 1:59:59.660]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:59.660 --> 2:00:08.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:08.740 --> 2:00:19.820]  Pastor David J. Smith is our guest, Dave, Andrew, Steve, George, Don, many others, your
[2:00:19.820 --> 2:00:20.820]  calls are coming up.
[2:00:20.820 --> 2:00:24.300]  I promise, when we start the next segment, we'll love the different directions you take
[2:00:24.300 --> 2:00:25.300]  us in.
[2:00:25.300 --> 2:00:30.700]  We will, a fortune there, never knowing what you'll bring up next.
[2:00:30.700 --> 2:00:34.500]  Going back to Pastor David J. Smith, we're going to give out his phone number and contact
[2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:37.540]  info, great books, great films, great research.
[2:00:37.540 --> 2:00:42.020]  I've learned so much from him since I woke up in the last 16, 17 years, since I got on
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:44.100]  air 13 years ago.
[2:00:44.100 --> 2:00:47.100]  You may have heard him as a sponsor on the network promoting his free magazine offer.
[2:00:47.100 --> 2:00:50.300]  He's not a sponsor of myself, he's a sponsor of the network.
[2:00:50.300 --> 2:00:53.380]  Though I would have him on if he wasn't a sponsor.
[2:00:53.380 --> 2:00:57.860]  We really appreciate him, but want to make that clear.
[2:00:57.860 --> 2:01:03.780]  Shifting gears, you know, again, back into the grassroots effect of this, it's so on
[2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:10.420]  its face, reading Kafka in 1984, but not just fiction, reading history, I mean, to have
[2:01:10.420 --> 2:01:16.340]  secret police everywhere, to have them intimidating people, to have them telling kids in schools
[2:01:16.340 --> 2:01:21.420]  as part of curriculum to spy on their parents, to have CPS kidnapping millions of children
[2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:27.940]  a year, millions, over a million and a half, to have the video of FEMA teaching the founding
[2:01:27.940 --> 2:01:28.940]  fathers were bad.
[2:01:28.940 --> 2:01:30.420]  I mean, that's case closed.
[2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:37.020]  The government's bankrupt, evil, bad, foreign-owned and run, I mean, it's foreign groups are buying
[2:01:37.020 --> 2:01:41.940]  up all the water supplies, doubling, tripling prices, mass raping economically is happening.
[2:01:41.940 --> 2:01:45.180]  I want to talk to you later about what's happening with the economy, the election, but I mean,
[2:01:45.180 --> 2:01:46.180]  you get what I'm saying.
[2:01:46.180 --> 2:01:49.460]  It's just, it's, it's, people say over, you know, when are they going to take over?
[2:01:49.460 --> 2:01:51.460]  They have taken over, pastor, I mean,
[2:01:51.460 --> 2:01:56.620]  Coulda Ta that's already taken place, there's no doubt about that.
[2:01:56.620 --> 2:01:59.940]  And that coulda Ta has given them the total control.
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:05.740]  And one thing that we need to understand is, if people are Democrats, we have proven, we
[2:02:05.740 --> 2:02:12.420]  just completed a three-part series about Bill and Hillary Clinton, and how Hillary Clinton
[2:02:12.420 --> 2:02:18.340]  has had close ties, her and Bill Clinton were the communist movement, even went into Italy
[2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:26.780]  and to the communist sectors to learn about Antonio Gramsci's economic program for America.
[2:02:26.780 --> 2:02:35.940]  And but there's one other thing, people don't know that much about Obama, but Obama sponsored
[2:02:35.940 --> 2:02:46.260]  Senate bill number 2433 giving a global taxation and America's share is 7 tenths of 1 percent
[2:02:46.260 --> 2:02:48.460]  of every sale if it passes.
[2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:52.380]  And we wrote a story about that, and that's going to be the global ID card as a regional
[2:02:52.380 --> 2:02:55.780]  global sales tax, which of course Neil Boertz is pushing.
[2:02:55.780 --> 2:02:56.780]  Go ahead.
[2:02:56.780 --> 2:03:00.180]  Well, this is now gone to committee.
[2:03:00.180 --> 2:03:04.780]  And so it'll come up within the next three to six months, surely.
[2:03:04.780 --> 2:03:10.340]  And so far, I've not been able to get one word from any of my senators or representatives.
[2:03:10.340 --> 2:03:11.900]  And no one knows about it.
[2:03:11.900 --> 2:03:17.580]  There's a whole flotilla of bills very close to passing for national sales taxes, new set
[2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:21.420]  income taxes on $500,000 or more.
[2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.460]  The public thinks that's the elite, no, that's the middle class.
[2:03:24.460 --> 2:03:27.900]  I mean, with the inflation, everybody's going to be worth half a million soon.
[2:03:27.900 --> 2:03:29.780]  It'll take that to buy a hamburger.
[2:03:29.780 --> 2:03:30.780]  Yeah.
[2:03:30.780 --> 2:03:35.380]  Well, I got an email from Kenya, Africa.
[2:03:35.380 --> 2:03:43.380]  Now this is where Obama's father grew up, and he was Muslim.
[2:03:43.380 --> 2:03:48.180]  And the email said, don't let Mr. Obama fool you.
[2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:55.060]  He is a racist, and he is also a Muslim.
[2:03:55.060 --> 2:04:00.740]  And they gave the technical term in Arabic, but I don't read it so anyway.
[2:04:00.740 --> 2:04:02.780]  They explained it.
[2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:08.060]  And they said, it means you penetrate inside of, say, a Christian organization.
[2:04:08.060 --> 2:04:13.180]  No, no, that's in the Koran that you're allowed to shave and allowed to not follow the customs
[2:04:13.180 --> 2:04:16.580]  as part of war, and they have a term for infiltrating.
[2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:17.580]  That's it.
[2:04:17.580 --> 2:04:21.540]  And so they said that's exactly what he's doing.
[2:04:21.540 --> 2:04:26.860]  And when he comes into the presidency of the United States, if he does, then he will come
[2:04:26.860 --> 2:04:31.780]  out and probably take the oath of office on the Koran.
[2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:37.820]  Well, we'll talk about that on the other side, and we'll talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[2:04:37.820 --> 2:04:39.780]  Stay with us.
[2:04:39.780 --> 2:04:52.620]  Greetings, my name is Dr. Bill Von Schacht with the White Paper Chronicles from the

[2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:57.860]  It's going to be incremental.
[2:06:57.860 --> 2:06:59.820]  This country is already teetering on the edge.
[2:06:59.820 --> 2:07:03.100]  Any incident, small or large, could trigger a total takeover.
[2:07:03.100 --> 2:07:04.420]  Anything could be the final push.

[2:07:07.900 --> 2:07:10.220]  you for life under total military control.

[2:07:13.620 --> 2:07:16.740]  Learn how to act around controlling troops and how to use their own psychology against
[2:07:16.740 --> 2:07:18.500]  them through social engineering.
[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:21.900]  When martial law is officially announced, checkpoints will be enforced, gun confiscations
[2:07:21.900 --> 2:07:25.100]  will occur for registered gun owners, and cities will be on lockdown.
[2:07:25.100 --> 2:07:28.060]  You will be dealing with a force that has been in training for years preparing for this
[2:07:28.060 --> 2:07:29.060]  takeover.

[2:07:39.300 --> 2:07:56.780]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:07:56.780 --> 2:07:57.780]  You want answers?
[2:07:57.780 --> 2:07:59.980]  Well, so does he.
[2:07:59.980 --> 2:08:04.140]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:04.140 --> 2:08:11.140]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:19.660]  Okay, I want to go to your calls.
[2:08:19.660 --> 2:08:24.780]  I want to go to David and Andrew and Steve and callers in Florida and Texas and everywhere
[2:08:24.780 --> 2:08:26.500]  else and we're going to do it.
[2:08:26.500 --> 2:08:30.340]  But David J. Smith, you were getting into Barack Obama, listen.
[2:08:30.340 --> 2:08:34.100]  We've got the documents, the control agent numbers now.
[2:08:34.100 --> 2:08:39.580]  Communism, as you know, talking about the Jesuit at Georgetown, Carol Quigley, Bill
[2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:46.540]  Clinton's mentor, the Rhodes Historian for the Rhodes Secret Society, which is an anglophile,
[2:08:46.540 --> 2:08:53.060]  quote, Protestant group, see at the top of the pyramid, it all nexuses together.
[2:08:53.060 --> 2:08:56.420]  But I agree with you about the Catholic Church being one of its main power modes right at
[2:08:56.420 --> 2:08:58.700]  the top of the pyramid.
[2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:04.660]  But we see there that Cordmire, the guy that ran the op-killing Kennedy with E. Howard
[2:09:04.660 --> 2:09:07.980]  Hunt, he was the section chief in London.
[2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:09.980]  The Clintons were under his control.
[2:09:09.980 --> 2:09:17.020]  We know they sent them all over, two communist meetings in Russia, China, training in Italy.
[2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:21.040]  And we know the Clintons for their low-level minions for the communist squads they used.
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.820]  They pardoned a bunch of communists that killed cops and others.
[2:09:23.820 --> 2:09:25.980]  I mean, we understand that's their cover.
[2:09:25.980 --> 2:09:29.860]  And again, I'm not saying communism isn't the banker's system, but the banker's created
[2:09:29.860 --> 2:09:32.540]  it, as you know, to con people back into serfdom.
[2:09:32.540 --> 2:09:37.020]  And that's now been declassified that Mao Zedong was put in by the CIA and even put
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:38.180]  that on the history channel.
[2:09:38.180 --> 2:09:40.180]  But again, it's all these subtleties.
[2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:43.500]  It's about how it's all interconnected at the higher levels.
[2:09:43.500 --> 2:09:46.140]  And I want to get your take on this.
[2:09:46.140 --> 2:09:51.980]  We then see the same thing with, you know, Barack Obama being handled by Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[2:09:51.980 --> 2:09:56.420]  the big anti-communist on the surface, and all these other top globalists and the Rockefellers
[2:09:56.420 --> 2:09:57.420]  and the Rothschilds.
[2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:02.420]  Then we hear, oh no, he's a Muslim, and I mean, you know, we know he's got Reverend
[2:10:02.420 --> 2:10:05.540]  Wright who says a lot of stuff that's true, then says some racist stuff on the other end
[2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:08.620]  of it and hangs out with Farrakhan.
[2:10:08.620 --> 2:10:14.420]  So I mean, I'm not doubting that his dad lived in Malaysia, lived in Africa, was a Muslim.
[2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:16.860]  I mean, it's really, it is right there.
[2:10:16.860 --> 2:10:19.420]  That's incredible evidence.
[2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:24.340]  But at the same time, Barack Obama just endorsed Bush Sr.'s attack on Iraq.
[2:10:24.340 --> 2:10:29.220]  And so I think that those are their, quote, credentials for the communities they sprung
[2:10:29.220 --> 2:10:30.780]  from to control them.
[2:10:30.780 --> 2:10:34.620]  But there's no doubt Barack Obama is New World Order, not Muslim.
[2:10:34.620 --> 2:10:39.460]  Just like Bill Clinton, sure, Gary Aldrich wrote the book, you know, high level FBI in
[2:10:39.460 --> 2:10:44.420]  the White House, and they were putting crack pipes and VI linen pins on the Christmas tree,
[2:10:44.420 --> 2:10:47.660]  and they were all wearing them, and that's confirmed.
[2:10:47.660 --> 2:10:50.700]  And again, that was meant to get out that they're communists.
[2:10:50.700 --> 2:10:53.620]  Do you, A, agree with me, B, want to comment on what I just said?
[2:10:53.620 --> 2:10:57.380]  Well, no, I believe everything you just said.
[2:10:57.380 --> 2:11:04.020]  And the key is that all of these top personnel, they are Luciferian.
[2:11:04.020 --> 2:11:10.180]  They created communism to be atheistic, to pit them in a cold war against the Western
[2:11:10.180 --> 2:11:13.060]  world of supposed Christianity.
[2:11:13.060 --> 2:11:16.700]  Then they're going to bring them together in a final conflict, and they're going to
[2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:19.700]  destroy atheism and Christianity both.
[2:11:19.700 --> 2:11:21.980]  And that's what Albert Pike wrote.
[2:11:21.980 --> 2:11:24.980]  That's what's so incredible is this is all publicly available.
[2:11:24.980 --> 2:11:30.860]  How could somebody in 1876 write letters and books predicting everything that happened
[2:11:30.860 --> 2:11:36.220]  if they didn't have some type of supernatural agency behind them?
[2:11:36.220 --> 2:11:39.540]  Tell folks about that, and we're going to go to one of these young men, and perhaps even
[2:11:39.540 --> 2:11:44.740]  the pastor for an update on this East Texas Baptist Bible School and Homeland Security
[2:11:44.740 --> 2:11:48.140]  saying, don't talk about the Constitution, or you're a terrorist, a quick update from
[2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:49.500]  them and then your calls.
[2:11:49.500 --> 2:11:51.580]  But comment on Albert Pike.
[2:11:51.580 --> 2:12:00.860]  Okay, Albert Pike in August of 1871, the 15th of August, wrote a letter to Giuseppe
[2:12:00.860 --> 2:12:01.860]  Messini.
[2:12:01.860 --> 2:12:04.980]  Messini was the revolutionary head of the Illuminati.
[2:12:04.980 --> 2:12:10.020]  He said there had to be three world wars and many revolutionary wars.
[2:12:10.020 --> 2:12:16.580]  But in a third of these world wars, they would pit the atheist against Christianity, and
[2:12:16.580 --> 2:12:20.580]  they would destroy and conquer both of them at the same time.
[2:12:20.580 --> 2:12:24.460]  And what do we see today, China, Russia?
[2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:33.860]  We see the United States in Iraq, China and Russia have made peace packs with Iran.
[2:12:33.860 --> 2:12:39.340]  And so if the United States goes into Iran, there could be the beginning of this final
[2:12:39.340 --> 2:12:45.500]  war, and which will destroy the West and atheism at the same time.
[2:12:45.500 --> 2:12:52.300]  And then because you see they already have a military, it's called Blackwater USA, headed
[2:12:52.300 --> 2:13:02.340]  by Eric Prince, who was a knight of Malta, sworn to bring the Pope as head of the world.
[2:13:02.340 --> 2:13:08.820]  And so Blackwater is in Iraq right now, and they're giving Iraqi citizens trouble.
[2:13:08.820 --> 2:13:13.820]  They're just shooting them down on the streets, and America gets credit for it, and it's not
[2:13:13.820 --> 2:13:20.460]  our military doing it, but it's these mercenaries outside the military code, and they can't
[2:13:20.460 --> 2:13:28.380]  be tried in the military courts of America because they're private mercenaries.
[2:13:28.380 --> 2:13:33.740]  And so when you put all this together, you see that Albert Pike, all of his program is
[2:13:33.740 --> 2:13:39.660]  about to come to pass, and the islanding laid down the final program to go hand in
[2:13:39.660 --> 2:13:41.620]  glove with his.
[2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:45.940]  They would first take Eastern Europe, they did it, World War II, then they would take
[2:13:45.940 --> 2:13:50.420]  the masses of Asia, they've done that, and then they said they would surround the United
[2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:53.500]  States and then fall like a ripe fruit into their hands.
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:57.700]  What do we see from Mexico all the way to the tip of South America?
[2:13:57.700 --> 2:13:59.420]  They're all socialist now.
[2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:04.740]  And by the way, this has been well publicized for 100 years, this is the British Naval Museum
[2:14:04.740 --> 2:14:10.060]  has the letters, the books, this is the guy whose picture hangs in all your Masonic halls,
[2:14:10.060 --> 2:14:11.060]  and that's the thing.
[2:14:11.060 --> 2:14:14.900]  I found with these globalists, they always push atheism, but when you get around them
[2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:18.300]  or really read their writings, they are deeply religious.
[2:14:18.300 --> 2:14:22.900]  It's like Dr. Eric Bianca at UT who says he wants to kill 90% of us, and he works in
[2:14:22.900 --> 2:14:27.180]  the biology lab and has connections to their level four bio weapons lab.
[2:14:27.180 --> 2:14:30.260]  And the FBI, by the way, did go question him because we demanded it.
[2:14:30.260 --> 2:14:34.780]  You want to question somebody real, go talk to this guy, and he got a 95% standing ovation
[2:14:34.780 --> 2:14:37.260]  when he was giving a speech saying kill everybody.
[2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:42.420]  The Texas Academy of Sciences, that's the point, is they're all into this, and he's
[2:14:42.420 --> 2:14:43.420]  on the UT website.
[2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:50.500]  I mean, it's his UT page on UT, dressed as a druid saying, talking about Lucifer.
[2:14:50.500 --> 2:14:54.780]  I mean, it's every time, I mean, even if you don't believe in God, I mean, I have to say
[2:14:54.780 --> 2:14:58.980]  when I was younger, I would doubt God and doubt things, but then, you know, but then
[2:14:58.980 --> 2:15:02.820]  when you see that the elite really believe it and are obsessed with it and are doing
[2:15:02.820 --> 2:15:09.460]  this and seem to know the future, I mean, how did this guy, 130 something years ago,
[2:15:09.460 --> 2:15:14.300]  right about, there'll be three world wars, and he just, and he detailed each one.
[2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:19.220]  I mean, how was he able to say the final one will be between the Muslims and the Christians
[2:15:19.220 --> 2:15:20.660]  and the atheists in the Middle East?
[2:15:20.660 --> 2:15:23.060]  I mean, how did he know that?
[2:15:23.060 --> 2:15:26.060]  Somebody gave him help.
[2:15:26.060 --> 2:15:30.020]  Well, he said, I feel the power of Lucifer seething in my hands.
[2:15:30.020 --> 2:15:31.540]  That's right.
[2:15:31.540 --> 2:15:36.140]  And even in skull and bones, when they lay on the coffin, they rise up born again because
[2:15:36.140 --> 2:15:41.540]  they felt the seething energy of Lucifer flowing through them.
[2:15:41.540 --> 2:15:47.460]  And so we are fighting a battle, and it's a secret battle, but it's a spiritual battle,
[2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.980]  and that's what the American people don't understand.
[2:15:49.980 --> 2:15:55.900]  Okay, the pastor, the young pastor is pastoring today, and he's unable to come on right now,
[2:15:55.900 --> 2:16:03.060]  but his friend Steve Barber there, witnessing all of this is able to come on with just like
[2:16:03.060 --> 2:16:04.060]  a two minute update.
[2:16:04.060 --> 2:16:06.580]  I'm not going to, not going to keep him long.
[2:16:06.580 --> 2:16:09.420]  His friend Jeff has gone through quite a bit.
[2:16:09.420 --> 2:16:16.300]  But talking to you, any updates on what's happened Monday since we exposed that Homeland
[2:16:16.300 --> 2:16:21.380]  Security came in, headline, Fesecuse student of terror and espionage for talking to Cub
[2:16:21.380 --> 2:16:23.740]  Scout group about constitution.
[2:16:23.740 --> 2:16:27.980]  East Texas pastor threatened by anonymous men in dark suits for giving talk to Boy Scouts
[2:16:27.980 --> 2:16:28.980]  about Bill of Rights.
[2:16:28.980 --> 2:16:31.860]  And then we have footage of FEMA teaching police this.
[2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:33.460]  This is really happening.
[2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:37.860]  Any other info or anything you want to say to Pastor David J. Smith?
[2:16:37.860 --> 2:16:38.860]  Yes, sir.
[2:16:38.860 --> 2:16:43.860]  I just wanted to say that, you know, I'm proactive and I don't wait around.
[2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:47.380]  I push back when things are pushed.
[2:16:47.380 --> 2:16:53.860]  And so what I've done is I've contacted Senator Karen Johnson in Arizona, her office, and
[2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:56.060]  also Congressman Ron Paul's office.
[2:16:56.060 --> 2:16:58.500]  I've heard back from Karen Johnson's office.
[2:16:58.500 --> 2:17:05.260]  I'm waiting to hear back from Ron Paul because I feel that if I get Ron Paul on board with
[2:17:05.260 --> 2:17:09.660]  what's going on with my friend, because this is a very serious thing, we're now the feds
[2:17:09.660 --> 2:17:14.100]  are calling a guy who's done nothing wrong and is actually doing his duty as an American,
[2:17:14.100 --> 2:17:16.900]  the terrorist and committing espionage.
[2:17:16.900 --> 2:17:18.620]  That's a very serious thing.
[2:17:18.620 --> 2:17:23.100]  And you know, we just kind of send a message to these people that you criminals, you are
[2:17:23.100 --> 2:17:24.100]  the criminal.
[2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:31.220]  Karen Johnson, Karen Johnson, Karen Johnson, Karen Johnson, Karen Johnson is in Arizona.
[2:17:31.220 --> 2:17:34.940]  And so that's not her jurisdiction here in Texas.
[2:17:34.940 --> 2:17:35.940]  Go ahead.
[2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:40.860]  All right, but I just wanted to make people with the government itself aware of this because
[2:17:40.860 --> 2:17:46.620]  I just figured, you know, these are high level people, you know, to basically, you know,
[2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:51.620]  get some help involved with this because honestly, Alex, you know, I'm concerned for
[2:17:51.620 --> 2:17:55.980]  myself and my situation with my family, but I'm more concerned for Jeff because he's
[2:17:55.980 --> 2:17:57.860]  high profile in this now.
[2:17:57.860 --> 2:18:03.020]  And I'll just say this, this is the main thing I wanted to let people know, you know, I've
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:07.380]  been letting people know about the interview we did Monday and what Jeff related that he's
[2:18:07.380 --> 2:18:12.260]  actually gone through, the responses I'm getting are anything from like, oh, that's really
[2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:19.340]  horrible, you know, too well, I'm not, I still don't want to, you know, get on board with
[2:18:19.340 --> 2:18:23.940]  this because I want to keep focused on what I'm doing, preaching the gospel.
[2:18:23.940 --> 2:18:27.660]  But you know, the thing is that silence is complicity.
[2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:31.740]  And you know, this is what I encouraged Jeff in the other day, that if you don't go public
[2:18:31.740 --> 2:18:37.380]  with this, you're actually being part of the problem, whether they're part of the solution.
[2:18:37.380 --> 2:18:38.380]  Absolutely.
[2:18:38.380 --> 2:18:39.580]  People have gained ground.
[2:18:39.580 --> 2:18:45.380]  And what I want to say is my sense of duty and right and honor overrides many fears that
[2:18:45.380 --> 2:18:46.380]  I have in this.
[2:18:46.380 --> 2:18:49.740]  Okay, Steve, thank you so much for popping in to give us an update.
[2:18:49.740 --> 2:18:53.300]  Yeah, a lot of people are saying, okay, it's true.
[2:18:53.300 --> 2:18:56.260]  You're a terrorist if you talk about the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[2:18:56.260 --> 2:18:59.500]  And yeah, they're saying, yeah, you got FEMA video of them teaching this.
[2:18:59.500 --> 2:19:00.780]  Maybe we should.
[2:19:00.780 --> 2:19:01.820]  Maybe it's bad.
[2:19:01.820 --> 2:19:03.120]  It's of the Lord.
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:06.220]  Let's follow their orders and never talk about the Bill of Rights again.
[2:19:06.220 --> 2:19:09.940]  I mean, how deceived is that, Pastor?
[2:19:09.940 --> 2:19:13.460]  You're as deceived as you can be if you think that's the truth.
[2:19:13.460 --> 2:19:18.460]  Because the Constitution of the United States is the official law of the land.
[2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:23.900]  And anybody tells us that we should not follow the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which
[2:19:23.900 --> 2:19:30.660]  protects us from tyranny, we have automatically laid down and said, Pirates, take over.
[2:19:30.660 --> 2:19:36.620]  Okay, we are going to your calls immediately and all these points are so great about the
[2:19:36.620 --> 2:19:38.500]  Jesuits and about the Barack Obama.

[2:20:57.780 --> 2:21:00.620]  completely destroys the official fable forever.
[2:21:00.620 --> 2:21:05.020]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[2:21:05.020 --> 2:21:09.820]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[2:21:09.820 --> 2:21:11.740]  crime are brought to justice.

[2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:41.460]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[2:21:41.460 --> 2:21:45.860]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[2:21:45.860 --> 2:21:47.420]  to Big Brother.
[2:21:47.420 --> 2:21:51.500]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[2:21:51.500 --> 2:21:55.140]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[2:21:55.140 --> 2:21:58.820]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[2:21:58.820 --> 2:22:01.980]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[2:22:01.980 --> 2:22:06.660]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the
[2:22:06.660 --> 2:22:07.660]  disease that we've seen.
[2:22:07.660 --> 2:22:11.180]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone
[2:22:11.180 --> 2:22:16.020]  who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular job a few months later, we know
[2:22:16.020 --> 2:22:17.020]  we're doing something right.
[2:22:17.020 --> 2:22:18.500]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[2:22:18.500 --> 2:22:23.460]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function
[2:22:23.460 --> 2:22:24.460]  is dead on.
[2:22:24.460 --> 2:22:28.780]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation
[2:22:28.780 --> 2:22:29.780]  problems.
[2:22:29.780 --> 2:22:30.780]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[2:24:14.700 --> 2:24:18.020]  Dave in California, then Andrew, Steve, Don, and others.
[2:24:18.020 --> 2:24:19.420]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Dave.
[2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:20.420]  Hi Alex.
[2:24:20.420 --> 2:24:21.420]  Hello, Pastor Smith.
[2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:23.980]  Alex, you have the soul of a poet, my brother.
[2:24:23.980 --> 2:24:24.980]  Consider publishing.
[2:24:24.980 --> 2:24:29.980]  I will be the first in line to buy a treatise on beauty and wonder and joy.
[2:24:29.980 --> 2:24:31.980]  Oh, you're very kind.
[2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:32.980]  It's true.
[2:24:32.980 --> 2:24:35.700]  And Pastor Smith, I have two for you and a fast one for you.
[2:24:35.700 --> 2:24:36.700]  Alex, if there's time.
[2:24:36.700 --> 2:24:37.700]  Pastor Smith.
[2:24:37.700 --> 2:24:41.700]  I'll just fire him out.
[2:24:41.700 --> 2:24:47.540]  Have you seen Dr. Catherine Albrecht's RFID treatise on the brink of a mark?
[2:24:47.540 --> 2:24:51.300]  And also, I'm a bit of a novice religiously.
[2:24:51.300 --> 2:24:58.540]  I know some about it, but if I was to go to speak to pastors one-on-one and try to find
[2:24:58.540 --> 2:25:03.300]  out where they're at on this whole subject of Romans 13 and all that, what's your best
[2:25:03.300 --> 2:25:06.460]  recommendation for the things that I should say to them?
[2:25:06.460 --> 2:25:10.980]  Well, I'm not familiar with the first question you asked.
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:18.820]  And the second question I can tell you, frankly, and honestly, for years and years, you will
[2:25:18.820 --> 2:25:21.740]  not get a straight answer.
[2:25:21.740 --> 2:25:26.980]  If you go to ministers and try to tell them anything about Romans 13, you will not get
[2:25:26.980 --> 2:25:27.980]  anywhere.
[2:25:27.980 --> 2:25:31.900]  I found that to be the truth.
[2:25:31.900 --> 2:25:34.460]  Any other suggestion then?
[2:25:34.460 --> 2:25:40.620]  Well, if you do have somebody that's willing just to sit down and be very polite and courteous
[2:25:40.620 --> 2:25:46.300]  and listen to what you say, then my suggestion would be that you just mention to them that
[2:25:46.300 --> 2:25:52.140]  the Constitution is the official document, the government of the United States, and that
[2:25:52.140 --> 2:25:56.940]  shouldn't we be following yet and not just all of these laws that are being passed that
[2:25:56.940 --> 2:25:57.940]  are illegal?
[2:25:57.940 --> 2:25:58.940]  Well, that's right.
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:00.340]  And turn it on its head.
[2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:01.540]  They claim Romans 13.
[2:26:01.540 --> 2:26:04.940]  Let's say that that's a right interpretation to lick the boots of government.
[2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:08.860]  Well, then why aren't the people running our government licking the boots of the Constitution?
[2:26:08.860 --> 2:26:10.140]  They're overthrowing it.
[2:26:10.140 --> 2:26:12.460]  They are the rebels, pastor.
[2:26:12.460 --> 2:26:14.460]  That's right.
[2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:15.460]  Interesting.
[2:26:15.460 --> 2:26:16.460]  Yeah.
[2:26:16.460 --> 2:26:17.460]  I mean, sir.
[2:26:17.460 --> 2:26:18.460]  No, no.
[2:26:18.460 --> 2:26:19.460]  Go ahead.
[2:26:19.460 --> 2:26:20.460]  Okay.
[2:26:20.460 --> 2:26:21.460]  One question for you, Alex.
[2:26:21.460 --> 2:26:27.700]  On this June 3rd to 6th operation checkpoint thing, have you heard any more about it?
[2:26:27.700 --> 2:26:33.420]  No, they just, I mean, fill us in.
[2:26:33.420 --> 2:26:36.740]  It brings a bell, but so much goes on sometimes I can't bring something up.
[2:26:36.740 --> 2:26:37.740]  Okay.
[2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:42.300]  So a couple of times I don't have any documentation for it, but apparently from June 3rd to the
[2:26:42.300 --> 2:26:50.140]  6th, multi-jurisdictional task force drills all over the United States, stopping cars
[2:26:50.140 --> 2:26:55.580]  and doing all the usual checkpoint stuff, and I just wanted to make a point on it real
[2:26:55.580 --> 2:26:56.580]  fast.
[2:26:56.580 --> 2:27:04.100]  I could suggest to your listeners to go to dot.gov, search for corridor map for your
[2:27:04.100 --> 2:27:05.100]  state.
[2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:08.300]  And then look, because what you'll see is you'll see the main corridors that go up to
[2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:13.460]  your state, and every main highway that intersects those corridors is where the corridors are
[2:27:13.460 --> 2:27:14.860]  being established first.
[2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:17.300]  In other words, they're pinch points.
[2:27:17.300 --> 2:27:21.180]  So if they're going to be doing this, if it's actually in fact true, that they are going
[2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:26.860]  to be stopping people for three days and getting us used to worshiping Big Brother, I'm betting
[2:27:26.860 --> 2:27:30.980]  that they're going to start, and that's where the focus of it's going to be, is that these
[2:27:30.980 --> 2:27:32.900]  little corridor checkpoints.
[2:27:32.900 --> 2:27:36.580]  Okay, let me stop you.
[2:27:36.580 --> 2:27:41.500]  You said Operation Checkpoint, and I thought, if I heard of that, there are national operations,
[2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:46.500]  and there is a national drill that just happened through the 1st of the 8th.
[2:27:46.500 --> 2:27:50.500]  There's two more national FEMA takeover mass roundup drills.
[2:27:50.500 --> 2:27:51.500]  That's admitted.
[2:27:51.500 --> 2:27:57.180]  I mean, I have the news articles, they're on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[2:27:57.180 --> 2:28:04.900]  And so, yes, and they then had another operation that was in three states, Tennessee, Arkansas,
[2:28:04.900 --> 2:28:09.820]  and one other, and we wrote articles about that three weeks ago when it happened.
[2:28:09.820 --> 2:28:16.300]  It was Operation Sudden Impact, and they went in and they admittedly, they said, quote,
[2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:20.460]  Fighting Terrorist, and they said, we'll be out fighting terror, and then they announced,
[2:28:20.460 --> 2:28:26.580]  yes, we arrested thousands for no insurance, we ran huge checkpoints, they went up to people
[2:28:26.580 --> 2:28:31.540]  on the street and searched them, and it was all under federal control with the military
[2:28:31.540 --> 2:28:36.620]  working with them, so that was called Operation Sudden Impact, so yes, they are having more
[2:28:36.620 --> 2:28:40.900]  drills coming up next month, the month after that, but they're, they call them drills,
[2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:47.860]  they're real, they really arrest you, and yes, it is Nazi Germany slash Russian style,
[2:28:47.860 --> 2:28:52.500]  just line up, we're searching you, Homeland Security said five years ago, life will be
[2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:54.100]  like an airport.
[2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:57.980]  You will be searched everywhere, already England does it, vans pull up, they make you walk
[2:28:57.980 --> 2:29:03.020]  through them, they scan you, they make you thumb scan and drug test you to go in restaurants,
[2:29:03.020 --> 2:29:07.100]  they just suddenly show up and arrest you if you don't, just hordes of goons running
[2:29:07.100 --> 2:29:11.260]  around, and Austin was doing it a few weeks ago, there were cherries everywhere at night,
[2:29:11.260 --> 2:29:15.900]  they were just randomly pulling people over, instead of a checkpoint, just random pullovers,
[2:29:15.900 --> 2:29:19.820]  stay there, David J. Smith, I want to get your comment on that, plug your website news
[2:29:19.820 --> 2:29:24.700]  group and do one more segment with you, if you'll grace us with the time to talk to all
[2:29:24.700 --> 2:29:30.660]  the callers that are patiently holding like Andrew, Steve, Don and Greg and many others,
[2:29:30.660 --> 2:29:38.180]  we'll be right back, stay with us.
[2:29:38.180 --> 2:29:47.540]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:47.540 --> 2:29:51.700]  The Federal Trade Commission estimates that 9 million Americans are victims of identity
[2:29:51.700 --> 2:29:56.980]  theft each year, the crime of identity theft occurs every 3.5 seconds, costing the victims
[2:29:56.980 --> 2:29:58.900]  an average of $8,000.
[2:29:58.900 --> 2:30:03.420]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common form of authentication and often the only protection
[2:30:03.420 --> 2:30:06.440]  between a hacker and your personal information.
[2:30:06.440 --> 2:30:10.340]  Passwords that are stored in a spreadsheet, text file, data file or any other file that
[2:30:10.340 --> 2:30:15.100]  is not encrypted and password protected are vulnerable to malicious theft and misuse.

[2:30:47.940 --> 2:30:52.180]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:30:52.180 --> 2:30:57.020]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:30:57.020 --> 2:31:02.740]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[2:31:02.740 --> 2:31:05.860]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[2:31:05.860 --> 2:31:11.780]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[2:31:11.780 --> 2:31:16.260]  of humanity is at hand.
[2:31:16.260 --> 2:31:21.700]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:31:21.700 --> 2:31:25.540]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:31:25.540 --> 2:31:28.220]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:31:28.220 --> 2:31:31.380]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need.
[2:31:31.380 --> 2:31:32.380]  They're after power.
[2:31:32.380 --> 2:31:33.380]  That's their after easy.
[2:31:33.380 --> 2:31:39.420]  Order in-game on DVD at www.prisonplanet.com or www.info-wars.com or watch it online right
[2:31:39.420 --> 2:31:46.420]  now at www.prisonplanet.tv, in-game, blueprint for global enslaved, you have been warned.
[2:31:46.420 --> 2:31:49.220]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[2:31:49.220 --> 2:31:52.620]  I have been waiting patiently for the government and mainstream media to inform you of what
[2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:56.700]  is turning out to be the biggest problem facing the world in the last 50 years.
[2:31:56.700 --> 2:32:00.500]  For the last three years, the Earth has consumed more food than it has been able to produce,
[2:32:00.500 --> 2:32:04.020]  and it has now finally caught up with us, and the U.S. commodities such as flour and
[2:32:04.020 --> 2:32:07.420]  rice are already being rationed and the next rice crop won't be available for another
[2:32:07.420 --> 2:32:09.220]  four to five months.
[2:32:09.220 --> 2:32:12.500]  Plates fall in the Southern Hemisphere, and many countries are short the food necessary
[2:32:12.500 --> 2:32:16.860]  to make it through the winter and have stopped exporting certain commodities altogether.
[2:32:16.860 --> 2:32:18.540]  Remember our trade deficit?
[2:32:18.540 --> 2:32:21.860]  Trillions of dollars have stacked up outside the country and are now rushing in to buy our
[2:32:21.860 --> 2:32:24.100]  food production at any price.
[2:32:24.100 --> 2:32:28.180]  By late summer, if not early fall, it is likely our government will step in and control food
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:30.540]  and food exports under martial law.
[2:32:30.540 --> 2:32:46.340]  Call Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 or visit us at www.readyreservefoods.com 1-800-453-2202.
[2:33:50.660 --> 2:33:51.860]  Maybe others will have to do with Smith.
[2:33:51.860 --> 2:33:53.220]  They'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:56.820]  The next hour, I'm going to do a huge news blitz, give you an update on some things that
[2:33:56.820 --> 2:33:58.780]  have happened to Wayne Madsen.
[2:33:58.780 --> 2:34:03.300]  He is in Houston right now in the middle of an investigation of the murder of a CIA officer
[2:34:03.300 --> 2:34:08.300]  down there, so we'll let you know what's happening there.
[2:34:08.300 --> 2:34:14.500]  But before we go back to Pastor David J. Smith, I want to encourage you to visit infowars.com
[2:34:14.500 --> 2:34:17.940]  and prisonplanet.com, but more than that, spread the word.
[2:34:17.940 --> 2:34:23.420]  Tell people about infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and our auxiliary sites like infowars.net
[2:34:23.420 --> 2:34:27.260]  and jonesreport.com and truthnews.us.
[2:34:27.260 --> 2:34:31.900]  And financially support us because we're about to go up to the next level.
[2:34:31.900 --> 2:34:38.380]  We are going to start a lot of new projects, a TV show on cable, I'm shooting for that,
[2:34:38.380 --> 2:34:42.660]  a lot of other things that we're going to do because the time is short, the enemy's
[2:34:42.660 --> 2:34:46.460]  moving against humanity, they're moving fast, we've got to move fast.
[2:34:46.460 --> 2:34:48.900]  And I'm going to plug this next hour.
[2:34:48.900 --> 2:34:53.540]  Like last Wednesday when I was going on vacation with my family for three days, a well needed
[2:34:53.540 --> 2:34:57.140]  one by the way, it really refreshed me, it was a real blessing.
[2:34:57.140 --> 2:35:00.460]  We got an email going, there's an Alex Jones money bomb and I was like, what?
[2:35:00.460 --> 2:35:02.620]  And they were like, well, will you respond?
[2:35:02.620 --> 2:35:08.620]  And I said, oh, when I get back, so Sunday afternoon, I looked at it and I'm like, well,
[2:35:08.620 --> 2:35:09.620]  who is this?
[2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:13.020]  Then I found out it is the original guy, even before Trevor Lyman got involved, the guy
[2:35:13.020 --> 2:35:16.100]  that started the Ron Paul Money Bomb, one of our listeners.
[2:35:16.100 --> 2:35:20.100]  So I needed to tell Tray today, the producer, I forgot to do this, to set him up for the
[2:35:20.100 --> 2:35:22.180]  show.
[2:35:22.180 --> 2:35:26.060]  So A, we need to get the guy on the show and B, so the money bomb isn't a failure, I better
[2:35:26.060 --> 2:35:29.580]  start promoting it because it's for May 31st.
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:35.100]  And I pledge to you, every cent will be spent on more cameras, we bought new cameras two
[2:35:35.100 --> 2:35:38.900]  years ago, they're already beat up, better computers, we could do a lot more if we had
[2:35:38.900 --> 2:35:39.900]  more money.
[2:35:39.900 --> 2:35:42.940]  And we're about to move into a bigger office, I've got it down to one or two places we're
[2:35:42.940 --> 2:35:48.140]  looking at to move the next few months, and more staff.
[2:35:48.140 --> 2:35:54.260]  And if I guarantee you that your money coming here will be spent in the fight against the
[2:35:54.260 --> 2:35:59.820]  New World Order, 100% of money bomb proceeds, I got to get around to my wife because we're
[2:35:59.820 --> 2:36:03.900]  such a big operation, setting up a PayPal for that, because I don't want to use our
[2:36:03.900 --> 2:36:07.420]  other PayPal for it because it'd get mixed up with the orders, video and book orders
[2:36:07.420 --> 2:36:11.660]  and present planet.tv subscriptions.
[2:36:11.660 --> 2:36:15.140]  But yeah, it's please help us spread the money bomb, I need Curt Nimble to do a story on
[2:36:15.140 --> 2:36:17.380]  it, Paul Watson to do a story on it.
[2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:22.060]  And I want him to go off, you know, basically the gist and ideas I have a next hour when
[2:36:22.060 --> 2:36:26.380]  I spend five minutes on that, so stand by everybody, that's something big we're doing.
[2:36:26.380 --> 2:36:29.080]  Also what makes this show possible is our sponsors.
[2:36:29.080 --> 2:36:33.180]  People like eFoods Direct, they are the longest continually operating storeable foods company
[2:36:33.180 --> 2:36:38.220]  in the nation, 27 years, I've gotten storeable foods from them four times, and I store it,
[2:36:38.220 --> 2:36:44.300]  I give it to family, I stockpile it, it's freeze dried and dehydrated, fits in very small areas,
[2:36:44.300 --> 2:36:46.420]  so it's very compact.
[2:36:46.420 --> 2:36:53.140]  The economy, with all that's happening, it's good clean non-GMO food, with all the things
[2:36:53.140 --> 2:36:57.700]  that are going on, it just makes sense to be prepared, it just makes sense to have storeable
[2:36:57.700 --> 2:37:05.340]  foods, and these are great folks that I trust and believe in, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633,

[2:37:20.660 --> 2:37:21.660]  Vitality.

[2:37:42.180 --> 2:37:47.060]  treatments for things, and one of the products that I've used is Aloe's Body Cleanse, your
[2:37:47.060 --> 2:37:51.980]  guts are where most of the toxins are secreted, and you need to flush that out, Aloe Vera,

[2:38:11.460 --> 2:38:18.540]  Okay, let's go back to Pastor David J. Smith and more calls, Pastor commenting on what
[2:38:18.540 --> 2:38:26.300]  Dave in California was saying briefly, checkpoints, random martial law drills, I mean, they admit
[2:38:26.300 --> 2:38:32.020]  that they're randomly coming up and shaking people down, totally twisting our police.
[2:38:32.020 --> 2:38:39.660]  Well, there's 10 basic steps to would-be dictators taking over a country, and one of them is to
[2:38:39.660 --> 2:38:45.260]  have their paramilitary, and they go into the streets and do exactly what they're doing
[2:38:45.260 --> 2:38:46.940]  here in America.
[2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:51.780]  This is what Hitler did, this is what Mussolini did, this is what dictators like Chavez has
[2:38:51.780 --> 2:38:59.100]  done down in South America, and so you can expect it because they're on the verge of
[2:38:59.100 --> 2:39:02.500]  taking over, and it's going to be a dictatorial process.
[2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:03.700]  Do you think they're doing that?
[2:39:03.700 --> 2:39:07.780]  I mean, we know that they designed the financial implosion, but they know that once it implodes,
[2:39:07.780 --> 2:39:09.780]  it's going to be big problems.
[2:39:09.780 --> 2:39:10.940]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:16.620]  They know without a doubt that there's going to be an uprising in this country that is going
[2:39:16.620 --> 2:39:21.780]  to be of monumental scale, and they're going to have to be ready, and so they've got all
[2:39:21.780 --> 2:39:27.620]  the military that is prepared, and they've already said that those individuals who are
[2:39:27.620 --> 2:39:31.340]  patriots are the problem.
[2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:33.820]  What do you want to say to police officers out there, Pastor?
[2:39:33.820 --> 2:39:40.180]  I mean, you're a well-known nationally televised pastor, been a pastor for 30-plus years.
[2:39:40.180 --> 2:39:45.260]  You are highly respected just out the Dallas, they're a very large church there.
[2:39:45.260 --> 2:39:50.980]  I mean, you're a mainline guy who predicted all this 20, 30 years ago, it's now happening.
[2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:53.540]  They've got some decisions to make, don't they?
[2:39:53.540 --> 2:39:59.260]  They do, and here's something that the American people don't know that is happening, but they're
[2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:05.820]  going in and they're getting special ops people out of the military and coming into
[2:40:05.820 --> 2:40:10.380]  the police departments, and so these are very tough people.
[2:40:10.380 --> 2:40:15.900]  While they're taught certain manners, if you say one thing out of line that they don't
[2:40:15.900 --> 2:40:23.620]  like, they can take you down, and so I would just say to the police that are listening,
[2:40:23.620 --> 2:40:32.060]  read your constitution, 98% in the Congress, House and the Senate have never read their
[2:40:32.060 --> 2:40:39.580]  constitution, and that's why the nation is in the problem that it's in.
[2:40:39.580 --> 2:40:44.980]  But if you'll read your constitution and you'll know the rights which people have, then you
[2:40:44.980 --> 2:40:50.620]  won't violate them, just because you wear a badge does not give you the authority to
[2:40:50.620 --> 2:40:54.540]  run over people in a Republican form of government.
[2:40:54.540 --> 2:40:58.700]  Well, I mean, how can officers listening not know the government's bad when we have them
[2:40:58.700 --> 2:41:04.180]  on video saying the bill of rights is bad, anybody that talks about it's a terrorist,
[2:41:04.180 --> 2:41:09.140]  and training manuals, and I mean, obviously that's the bad guys, obviously the government's
[2:41:09.140 --> 2:41:10.140]  bad.
[2:41:10.140 --> 2:41:14.740]  Well, I agree with that, but look at Blackwater USA.
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:19.660]  They went into New Orleans, they, I mean, our government had to pay them millions of
[2:41:19.660 --> 2:41:24.540]  dollars up to 53 million to go in and patrol the streets.
[2:41:24.540 --> 2:41:28.380]  They're the ones that stopped the water and the food getting into the people as fast as
[2:41:28.380 --> 2:41:30.220]  it should have been.
[2:41:30.220 --> 2:41:35.100]  They're the ones who are hiring CIA agents at double the pay.
[2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:41.940]  They're hiring Navy SEAL special ops people at 12 times the pay if they were in our military
[2:41:41.940 --> 2:41:43.620]  to be in a private army.
[2:41:43.620 --> 2:41:46.540]  And there's a reason there's so much money because they're doing evil.
[2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:47.540]  That's right.
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:50.620]  Yeah, folks, nothing's free in this world.
[2:41:50.620 --> 2:41:54.980]  And you know, a lot of you get goal oriented, you'll do anything for that goal.
[2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:58.900]  And then you, once you get it, you're going to find out it's worth nothing.
[2:41:58.900 --> 2:42:02.380]  Yep, I mean, money.
[2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:05.180]  People say it's so incredible that I can't be bought or you can't be bought.
[2:42:05.180 --> 2:42:07.100]  I don't even have a choice.
[2:42:07.100 --> 2:42:08.740]  I mean, it burns in my bones.
[2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:11.460]  Like Ezekiel said, I couldn't sell out.
[2:42:11.460 --> 2:42:14.100]  I mean, money means nothing to me.
[2:42:14.100 --> 2:42:15.980]  All it is is fuel to fight evil.
[2:42:15.980 --> 2:42:20.780]  What matters is what I believe and how and what I stand up for and who I am.
[2:42:20.780 --> 2:42:23.100]  And to me, that's not even exceptional, Pastor Smith.
[2:42:23.100 --> 2:42:27.300]  I don't understand how people will just do anything for money and it's all an illusion
[2:42:27.300 --> 2:42:28.380]  of a magician.
[2:42:28.380 --> 2:42:31.220]  It's all fiat that the bankers made.
[2:42:31.220 --> 2:42:36.740]  They think they're going to be the top personnel in this new world order.
[2:42:36.740 --> 2:42:44.500]  And so they're willing to sell the cells out, but it's not going to be that way at all.
[2:42:44.500 --> 2:42:50.340]  And our congressmen, they're not going to be in the top echelon of the new world order.
[2:42:50.340 --> 2:42:54.180]  Many of them, just like the communists said years ago, they can't wait for the day that
[2:42:54.180 --> 2:43:00.140]  they can cut their throats and sing about the blood all over the Congress.
[2:43:00.140 --> 2:43:02.300]  Well that's it.
[2:43:02.300 --> 2:43:07.140]  Whether it's Hitler, Stalin, it doesn't matter what type of regime, if it's authoritarian,
[2:43:07.140 --> 2:43:11.980]  they always wipe out and imprison and kill the guys that brought them to power because
[2:43:11.980 --> 2:43:16.500]  they know where the bodies are buried and they like to punish them and blame the purges
[2:43:16.500 --> 2:43:18.740]  on the people on them.
[2:43:18.740 --> 2:43:23.820]  And they also know that they're the traitors that opened the drawbridge and so they don't
[2:43:23.820 --> 2:43:25.940]  trust them.
[2:43:25.940 --> 2:43:26.940]  That's right.
[2:43:26.940 --> 2:43:32.460]  And you look at every dictatorship that has risen, Lenin did it, Stalin did it, every
[2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:36.020]  single one of them, they eliminated the competition.
[2:43:36.020 --> 2:43:37.820]  Yeah, that's it.
[2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:38.980]  It's also the competition.
[2:43:38.980 --> 2:43:42.900]  They're afraid that these guys will come up under them.
[2:43:42.900 --> 2:43:47.100]  And so they actually do normally wipe them out and then try to hire, quote, better people
[2:43:47.100 --> 2:43:50.260]  who are more, quote, moral, who will just carry out their operations.
[2:43:50.260 --> 2:43:52.940]  They have no idea what's in store for them.
[2:43:52.940 --> 2:43:53.940]  Let's take a call.
[2:43:53.940 --> 2:43:55.420]  Andrew in Oklahoma, thanks for holding.
[2:43:55.420 --> 2:43:56.420]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:43:56.420 --> 2:43:57.420]  Thanks, Pastor Smith.
[2:43:57.420 --> 2:44:03.540]  In fact, I interviewed Pastor Smith back in 1999 for the Waukesha Hatchee Daily Light
[2:44:03.540 --> 2:44:08.620]  when I was a reporter there and my editor never ran the story.
[2:44:08.620 --> 2:44:14.420]  But anyway, let me find out from both of your thoughts on Bush and Cheney.
[2:44:14.420 --> 2:44:20.820]  Once they're, you know, their time is up, Bush just going to return to Crawford, Texas
[2:44:20.820 --> 2:44:22.740]  and just completely get a retire.
[2:44:22.740 --> 2:44:24.900]  He is selling that movie stage.
[2:44:24.900 --> 2:44:25.900]  That's up for sale.
[2:44:25.900 --> 2:44:27.220]  That was, he doesn't ride horses.
[2:44:27.220 --> 2:44:28.220]  He's not from Texas.
[2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:30.580]  I'm not knocking folks from Kenny Bunkport.
[2:44:30.580 --> 2:44:33.100]  It's just, I don't like it in the blame for him.
[2:44:33.100 --> 2:44:39.460]  And Cheney's moving to Dubai, Bush has got a place in Dubai and Ecuador and so everything's
[2:44:39.460 --> 2:44:40.460]  going to Dubai.
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:42.940]  I've had some Dubai Arabs on YouTube attacking me now.
[2:44:42.940 --> 2:44:44.500]  They love the New World Order.
[2:44:44.500 --> 2:44:47.660]  The Saudis are big in it and no, they're all leaving the country.
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:51.020]  In fact, most of the elite have already left the country.
[2:44:51.020 --> 2:44:52.740]  David J. Smith, comments on that.
[2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:58.700]  Well, they're going to leave the country because they know the United States is going to be
[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:01.300]  turned over to the military.
[2:45:01.300 --> 2:45:08.820]  They're going to allow Muslims to come in with their nuclear bombs, which they've gotten
[2:45:08.820 --> 2:45:13.100]  from Russia and other sources.
[2:45:13.100 --> 2:45:18.460]  And so they're going to try to take out America and these elite have to be out of the country.
[2:45:18.460 --> 2:45:19.460]  That's right.
[2:45:19.460 --> 2:45:22.060]  Folks, I know people worth billions of dollars, okay?
[2:45:22.060 --> 2:45:26.060]  And I know other technocrats who represent billionaires.
[2:45:26.060 --> 2:45:31.500]  And I'm telling you, for four years, it's the equivalent of hanging off the helicopters,
[2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:36.220]  skids in 75 and Saigon during the evacuation, you ever seen them on top of the U.S. Embassy
[2:45:36.220 --> 2:45:38.860]  hanging on helicopters, kids, they are running.
[2:45:38.860 --> 2:45:45.740]  They are Cook Islands, Costa Rica, Australia, New Zealand, Hollywood is all running.
[2:45:45.740 --> 2:45:47.300]  I mean, it is.
[2:45:47.300 --> 2:45:50.220]  And their words are, quote, there won't be an America.
[2:45:50.220 --> 2:45:52.340]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:58.620]  I'm just saying they have set something up so horrible for us that they're leaving.
[2:45:58.620 --> 2:45:59.620]  Pastor comments.
[2:45:59.620 --> 2:46:06.740]  Well, they're going to be leaving because they know that America is a Christian nation
[2:46:06.740 --> 2:46:10.420]  down deep, basically.
[2:46:10.420 --> 2:46:16.020]  And there were surveys made two years ago that still said that 84% of Americans believed
[2:46:16.020 --> 2:46:19.980]  in God and Jesus Christ and they were nominal Christians.
[2:46:19.980 --> 2:46:27.500]  Now, if you have Lucifer as the head of a New World Order, now, who are you going to
[2:46:27.500 --> 2:46:31.100]  try to exterminate, the name of Jesus Christ?
[2:46:31.100 --> 2:46:34.540]  Where is it being preached from, more than any other place in the world?
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:38.860]  The United States and at one time, Great Britain.
[2:46:38.860 --> 2:46:43.500]  But today it's the United States, so it's got, that name has to be wiped off the face
[2:46:43.500 --> 2:46:44.500]  of the earth.
[2:46:44.500 --> 2:46:48.700]  And again, folks, even if you don't believe in Christianity, the elites do.
[2:46:48.700 --> 2:46:51.180]  They say Christianity is their enemy.
[2:46:51.180 --> 2:46:56.180]  And I don't mean the fake Christianity you see on the TBN shows.
[2:46:56.180 --> 2:46:58.860]  Okay, caller, I appreciate your call.
[2:46:58.860 --> 2:47:00.180]  Let's talk to Steve in Colorado.
[2:47:00.180 --> 2:47:01.780]  Steve, you're on the air.
[2:47:01.780 --> 2:47:02.780]  Alex.
[2:47:02.780 --> 2:47:04.260]  Hello, Alex and David.
[2:47:04.260 --> 2:47:05.260]  Hi.
[2:47:05.260 --> 2:47:10.660]  First of all, I just wanted to recognize that this May 14th today is the 60th anniversary
[2:47:10.660 --> 2:47:12.620]  of the State of Israel.
[2:47:12.620 --> 2:47:17.620]  And so that is a fulfillment of prophecy from the Old Testament.
[2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:21.420]  And then I had three other quick points, and I will make them quick, Alex, because I know
[2:47:21.420 --> 2:47:23.020]  you got cars waiting.
[2:47:23.020 --> 2:47:30.500]  The second point is, Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma wrote that Lucifer is God.
[2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:36.060]  So, masons, and of course, most masons don't understand this, because like you had mentioned
[2:47:36.060 --> 2:47:39.660]  earlier, David, they're not told the true nature of the organization until they get
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:41.340]  up to about the 33rd degree.
[2:47:41.340 --> 2:47:43.140]  Yeah, they're despised.
[2:47:43.140 --> 2:47:47.820]  And they're called porch masons, and the upper masons laugh at them and just hate their
[2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:48.820]  guts.
[2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:49.820]  Right.
[2:47:49.820 --> 2:47:54.220]  But Albert Pike actually wrote, and unfortunately I don't have a page number, but he actually
[2:47:54.220 --> 2:48:01.220]  wrote in Morals and Dogma that Lucifer is God and that Adonai is nothing, which is
[2:48:01.220 --> 2:48:03.620]  Adonai the God of the Jews.
[2:48:03.620 --> 2:48:10.340]  And then the next thing is, you were mentioning about the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta.
[2:48:10.340 --> 2:48:16.540]  I would also tend to think that Opus Dei, which is Latin for the work of God, is probably
[2:48:16.540 --> 2:48:20.740]  also in there with the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta.
[2:48:20.740 --> 2:48:24.860]  And then the final thing that I wanted to mention, and I have one quick question for
[2:48:24.860 --> 2:48:25.860]  you also.
[2:48:25.860 --> 2:48:30.380]  The worst thing about the Roman Catholic Church is that they teach a false salvation.
[2:48:30.380 --> 2:48:36.420]  They teach supposed salvation by faith and works, but true salvation is by faith alone
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:38.300]  in what Jesus Christ did.
[2:48:38.300 --> 2:48:40.300]  No works associated with it at all.
[2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:43.580]  Instead of you have salvation, aren't you going to have the fruits of the works?
[2:48:43.580 --> 2:48:48.180]  I mean, I don't agree that it's works, but what I'm saying is, is that I see all these
[2:48:48.180 --> 2:48:52.540]  fake Protestant preachers going, hey, don't have any guilt, don't be involved, don't be
[2:48:52.540 --> 2:48:57.060]  involved in your community, just come here, drive Cadillacs, feel good, I'll dance around
[2:48:57.060 --> 2:49:01.700]  in a fancy suit like a little pimp preacher and tell you everything's fine and worship
[2:49:01.700 --> 2:49:02.700]  the government.
[2:49:02.700 --> 2:49:05.300]  Pastor, can you speak to that?
[2:49:05.300 --> 2:49:06.700]  Absolutely.
[2:49:06.700 --> 2:49:11.540]  Can you accept Jesus Christ and you have your sins forgiven from that day forward?
[2:49:11.540 --> 2:49:17.460]  You obey his law to prevent you from becoming a sinner again, and that's not works.
[2:49:17.460 --> 2:49:20.420]  That's just doing what you should do.
[2:49:20.420 --> 2:49:25.620]  But there's these people that do know works and they say, hey, I've got the justification,
[2:49:25.620 --> 2:49:28.820]  it's done, and then I'm going to go to the topless bar right now.
[2:49:28.820 --> 2:49:29.820]  Right.
[2:49:29.820 --> 2:49:33.340]  James 2 says faith without works is dead.
[2:49:33.340 --> 2:49:34.340]  Faith.
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:40.860]  Yes, you have faith in the saving power of Jesus Christ and his shed blood, but then
[2:49:40.860 --> 2:49:44.820]  you obey his commandments to prevent you from being a sinner again.
[2:49:44.820 --> 2:49:50.260]  Now, do the Calvinists really believe that you once you're saved, you can never go back?
[2:49:50.260 --> 2:49:51.660]  I know some do.
[2:49:51.660 --> 2:49:53.220]  I don't know which ones.
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:54.220]  Do you agree with that?
[2:49:54.220 --> 2:49:58.660]  Oh, absolutely not, because I mean, I've read so many things in the Bible where people
[2:49:58.660 --> 2:50:01.100]  were with God and then left.
[2:50:01.100 --> 2:50:02.100]  Right.
[2:50:02.100 --> 2:50:06.820]  There's four, four to six, says it, that if you go back into the world, then you are
[2:50:06.820 --> 2:50:10.420]  trampling on the shed blood of Jesus Christ again.
[2:50:10.420 --> 2:50:15.380]  And then in Hebrews chapter 10, it says the same thing down and around about verse 27
[2:50:15.380 --> 2:50:17.660]  and 28.
[2:50:17.660 --> 2:50:21.620]  And so there's many places in the Bible that says once you put your hand to the plow and
[2:50:21.620 --> 2:50:26.500]  you go forward and you truly understand, then you don't go backwards.
[2:50:26.500 --> 2:50:32.900]  Isn't it the ultimate sin to know God, but then willfully harden your heart?
[2:50:32.900 --> 2:50:33.900]  Absolutely.
[2:50:33.900 --> 2:50:34.900]  Yeah.
[2:50:34.900 --> 2:50:36.420]  So how could you know God, but then harden your heart?
[2:50:36.420 --> 2:50:39.020]  I mean, turning to evil, deciding.
[2:50:39.020 --> 2:50:49.540]  All right, we'll be right back with a few final phone calls for Pastor David J. Smith.
[2:50:49.540 --> 2:50:53.140]  Do you want to know right now how you can drive around using water as fuel and laugh

[2:51:59.380 --> 2:52:02.780]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:05.940]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:52:05.940 --> 2:52:11.860]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%

[2:53:55.380 --> 2:53:56.380]  here in just a moment.
[2:53:56.380 --> 2:54:00.180]  Tell you when you can watch him on international satellite television.
[2:54:00.180 --> 2:54:02.100]  Look, I'm skipping ahead.
[2:54:02.100 --> 2:54:06.340]  I'm guessing this is John from Ohio who's like a communist.
[2:54:06.340 --> 2:54:08.660]  We don't screen calls, but I know there's a John in Ohio that calls.
[2:54:08.660 --> 2:54:13.420]  I'm going to skip ahead of John and Greg, but John, I'm going to go to you really fast
[2:54:13.420 --> 2:54:16.780]  because I'm guessing you're the communist that you disagree with Pastor David J. Smith.
[2:54:16.780 --> 2:54:18.180]  No, I'm not a communist.
[2:54:18.180 --> 2:54:19.180]  Okay.
[2:54:19.180 --> 2:54:20.180]  Okay.
[2:54:20.180 --> 2:54:21.180]  Okay.
[2:54:21.180 --> 2:54:22.180]  Let me stop you.
[2:54:22.180 --> 2:54:23.180]  You're not the normal John from Ohio, so I apologize.
[2:54:23.180 --> 2:54:24.180]  Go ahead and ask your question.
[2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:28.540]  No, my sister introduced me to your show when she gave me the Bohemian growth tape and I'm
[2:54:28.540 --> 2:54:30.660]  fully sold on what all y'all saying.
[2:54:30.660 --> 2:54:31.900]  No, no, no, it's not that.
[2:54:31.900 --> 2:54:33.620]  You're allowed to disagree too.
[2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:34.620]  John has called.
[2:54:34.620 --> 2:54:35.620]  Let me stop you.
[2:54:35.620 --> 2:54:36.620]  Let me stop you.
[2:54:36.620 --> 2:54:40.860]  John has called and Pastor David J. Smith hasn't been on and attacked him.
[2:54:40.860 --> 2:54:42.220]  So that's why I thought it was John.
[2:54:42.220 --> 2:54:43.220]  Go ahead.
[2:54:43.220 --> 2:54:44.220]  Okay.
[2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:45.220]  No, I agree with everything.
[2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:46.420]  No, no, you're a separate John.
[2:54:46.420 --> 2:54:47.420]  John's a good guy.
[2:54:47.420 --> 2:54:48.420]  Go ahead.
[2:54:48.420 --> 2:54:49.420]  Yeah.
[2:54:49.420 --> 2:54:50.420]  I drew everything you're saying.
[2:54:50.420 --> 2:54:51.420]  My sister introduced me to your show.
[2:54:51.420 --> 2:54:52.420]  I'm sold.
[2:54:52.420 --> 2:54:54.420]  I got time off to listen to you today.
[2:54:54.420 --> 2:55:00.020]  I want to ask the pastor, has he seen the Clinton Chronicles and could he speak briefly
[2:55:00.020 --> 2:55:04.220]  again about what he was saying about that letter from Kenya, from where Obama people
[2:55:04.220 --> 2:55:05.220]  was from again?
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:06.660]  I'll get off the air.
[2:55:06.660 --> 2:55:07.660]  Thank you, sir.
[2:55:07.660 --> 2:55:08.660]  God bless you for listening.
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:13.380]  I have heard of the Clinton Chronicles, but I have not personally seen them yet.
[2:55:13.380 --> 2:55:14.380]  It's excellent.
[2:55:14.380 --> 2:55:15.380]  I've seen it.
[2:55:15.380 --> 2:55:16.380]  Larry Nichols did it.
[2:55:16.380 --> 2:55:17.380]  Yes.
[2:55:17.380 --> 2:55:18.380]  And I know Larry Nichols.
[2:55:18.380 --> 2:55:26.380]  I did an interview with him many years ago about the email from Kenya.
[2:55:26.380 --> 2:55:33.820]  They just basically said America don't be fooled that Mr. Obama is a racist and he's
[2:55:33.820 --> 2:55:37.460]  even put out a little booklet.
[2:55:37.460 --> 2:55:41.820]  And I've found it on the internet as something to do with his father.
[2:55:41.820 --> 2:55:49.100]  I forgot the exact title of it right now, but where he's racist and it said that he
[2:55:49.100 --> 2:55:52.140]  is a secret Islamic.
[2:55:52.140 --> 2:55:56.300]  So we'll have to wait and see.
[2:55:56.300 --> 2:56:00.220]  Well we know there's a big Masonic connection to the Muslims and I'm not attacking Muslims
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:01.260]  here but Muslims.
[2:56:01.260 --> 2:56:05.700]  Your Koran says don't worship idols, what are those things on top of your buildings?
[2:56:05.700 --> 2:56:11.060]  Again, we've got to have you back up, Pastor David J. Smith.
[2:56:11.060 --> 2:56:14.580]  Fire out your website and toll free number for folks.

[2:56:33.380 --> 2:56:41.900]  Our website is NewsWatch Magazine, www.newswatchmagazine.org.
[2:56:41.900 --> 2:56:44.540]  Okay, Don in Texas, you're on the air with David J. Smith.
[2:56:44.540 --> 2:56:45.540]  Well, hi there.
[2:56:45.540 --> 2:56:52.060]  Yeah, I've enjoyed listening to Pastor Smith many, many, many, let's start with the years.
[2:56:52.060 --> 2:56:56.540]  I was going to talk about the attack on the people in Colorado City or whether it's the
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:56:59.660]  Mormon, they call them the Mormon polygamous group.
[2:56:59.660 --> 2:57:00.660]  Yes.
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:04.980]  I don't know that they ever said that they were polygamous or had a big sign out in front
[2:57:04.980 --> 2:57:08.820]  of their property, which is a beautiful place.
[2:57:08.820 --> 2:57:11.300]  Well now they're going to raid some place in Texas.
[2:57:11.300 --> 2:57:15.900]  This is about the government grandstanding to train you to violate people's due process.
[2:57:15.900 --> 2:57:18.900]  I don't agree with polygamy and these groups do seem weird.
[2:57:18.900 --> 2:57:22.900]  My point is the greater evil is a roving government with army tanks.
[2:57:22.900 --> 2:57:24.780]  They, it wasn't just APCs.
[2:57:24.780 --> 2:57:27.340]  David J. Smith comments on that.
[2:57:27.340 --> 2:57:33.860]  Well, let's face it, just like Waco, just like Ruby Ridge, it's all going to come down.
[2:57:33.860 --> 2:57:39.860]  They're going to take a fringe group and come up with an excuse and then they're going
[2:57:39.860 --> 2:57:40.860]  to attack them.
[2:57:40.860 --> 2:57:47.580]  They're going to separate homes and this is just the precursor that all Christians in
[2:57:47.580 --> 2:57:50.940]  America are going to be faced with.
[2:57:50.940 --> 2:57:53.260]  They've announced a bunch of other people they want to raid now.
[2:57:53.260 --> 2:57:54.260]  That's it.
[2:57:54.260 --> 2:57:56.500]  They're addressing it with an easy target first.
[2:57:56.500 --> 2:57:57.500]  That's right.
[2:57:57.500 --> 2:57:59.980]  Like, oh, we're only taking the Nazis free speech and then it's everybody's.
[2:57:59.980 --> 2:58:04.140]  Oh, we're only, you know what, David J. Smith, I've twisted your arm to stay five more minutes
[2:58:04.140 --> 2:58:07.540]  because I want to be fair and take a few final calls.
[2:58:07.540 --> 2:58:10.500]  We've only got a five minute segment back in 70 seconds.
[2:58:10.500 --> 2:58:13.780]  We're going to start the fourth hour in 70 seconds.
[2:58:13.780 --> 2:58:18.860]  Come back and let Don finish up and then talk to Greg.
[2:58:18.860 --> 2:58:22.940]  Then that'll be it with Pastor David J. Smith and I got a bunch of other news.
[2:58:22.940 --> 2:58:25.700]  I'm going to be covering huge news blitz coming up.
[2:58:25.700 --> 2:58:27.700]  Stay with us.

[2:58:44.500 --> 2:58:46.020]  hour there is hope.

[2:58:49.100 --> 2:58:53.300]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New

[2:59:42.980 --> 2:59:47.180]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:47.180 --> 3:00:00.340]  Okay, we're now into the new fourth hour.
[3:00:00.340 --> 3:00:01.340]  We've been doing it for the last month.
[3:00:01.340 --> 3:00:02.540]  A lot of affiliates picking up the show.
[3:00:02.540 --> 3:00:03.540]  We really appreciate that.
[3:00:03.540 --> 3:00:07.900]  I want to take one or two final calls for Pastor David J. Smith and plug his national
[3:00:07.900 --> 3:00:11.460]  television program before he leaves us.
[3:00:11.460 --> 3:00:13.860]  Pastor, let's do that now.
[3:00:13.860 --> 3:00:18.340]  One more time, the website, the free magazine, your subscription offer and when people can
[3:00:18.340 --> 3:00:21.660]  tune in and see your national television transmission.
[3:00:21.660 --> 3:00:25.340]  Okay, now the TV show is on direct TV.
[3:00:25.340 --> 3:00:26.820]  You have to have a dish.
[3:00:26.820 --> 3:00:32.260]  Direct TV is on channel 367.
[3:00:32.260 --> 3:00:38.740]  Eastern time, it's at midnight, Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night, 11 p.m., Monday,
[3:00:38.740 --> 3:00:42.500]  Tuesday and Wednesday in the central time zone.
[3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:46.340]  So in California, that'd be 9 p.m. Pacific.
[3:00:46.340 --> 3:00:47.340]  That's correct.
[3:00:47.340 --> 3:00:54.780]  And our toll free number is 1-800-516-8736.
[3:00:54.780 --> 3:00:59.460]  And you have a free offer of a year subscription of News Watch Magazine, now in its 28th year
[3:00:59.460 --> 3:01:00.980]  of publishing.
[3:01:00.980 --> 3:01:04.740]  Let's go ahead and take a few quick calls here.
[3:01:04.740 --> 3:01:08.420]  Greg in New Jersey, thanks for holding in on the year with Pastor David J. Smith.
[3:01:08.420 --> 3:01:09.420]  Excellent show, gentlemen.
[3:01:09.420 --> 3:01:10.420]  I really appreciate it.
[3:01:10.420 --> 3:01:12.300]  I learned a lot today.
[3:01:12.300 --> 3:01:17.700]  One thing that I've been called is a racist because in New Jersey, they had a Mexican
[3:01:17.700 --> 3:01:22.700]  consulate on wheels, literally come through Ocean, Monmouth, Middlesex County.
[3:01:22.700 --> 3:01:26.460]  Yeah, handing out fake IDs to everybody, but then the police throw the book at you for
[3:01:26.460 --> 3:01:30.700]  not having a driver's license, but the illegals are above the law allowed to drink and drive.
[3:01:30.700 --> 3:01:33.140]  That's because they're part of taking over for the North American Union.
[3:01:33.140 --> 3:01:35.460]  Again, we're not bashing those people.
[3:01:35.460 --> 3:01:37.260]  The point is they're a weapon, a tool.
[3:01:37.260 --> 3:01:38.260]  Go ahead.
[3:01:38.260 --> 3:01:39.260]  That's even better than that.
[3:01:39.260 --> 3:01:43.860]  They even had representatives from Bank of America there, signing up people for accounts.
[3:01:43.860 --> 3:01:46.260]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong.
[3:01:46.260 --> 3:01:47.820]  I mean, I understand.
[3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:52.220]  Yeah, if there was something going on in America and something terrible is happening in America
[3:01:52.220 --> 3:01:57.340]  and Canada was the only place to go, maybe, you know, I could see something like that.
[3:01:57.340 --> 3:01:58.340]  Well, let me clear here.
[3:01:58.340 --> 3:02:03.220]  Wells Fargo and Bank of America, they both accept, with a consulate matricula and give
[3:02:03.220 --> 3:02:07.300]  them bank account, a citizen has to have three forms of ID.
[3:02:07.300 --> 3:02:09.700]  And we've gone in and protested Bank of America.
[3:02:09.700 --> 3:02:11.820]  Let me get a comment from David J. Smith on this.
[3:02:11.820 --> 3:02:18.900]  Well, it's obvious that they're going right along with President Bush and Foxes and British
[3:02:18.900 --> 3:02:25.860]  Prime Minister Martin's program, and they want to have a United States of North America,
[3:02:25.860 --> 3:02:31.700]  you might say, the three nations, one economy, so they're going to try to give them their
[3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:36.020]  own bank accounts, open it for them, because they see nothing but money.
[3:02:36.020 --> 3:02:42.980]  Once again, this is the greed of what's going on in America and basically the whole world.
[3:02:42.980 --> 3:02:49.020]  And two years ago, Bank of America admitted in an AP article that quote, oh, there's pressure
[3:02:49.020 --> 3:02:50.640]  to kick these poor people out.
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:52.780]  So yeah, we're bending the rules to help them.
[3:02:52.780 --> 3:02:57.420]  No, this is an agenda to balkanize and drive down wages in this country.
[3:02:57.420 --> 3:02:58.780]  That's right.
[3:02:58.780 --> 3:03:01.020]  Anything else you want to add there, Greg?
[3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:04.660]  Well, the thing that just troubles me is the fact that if you bring up the fact that, you
[3:03:04.660 --> 3:03:08.740]  know, if you're a law abiding citizen of the United States, and then you point out the
[3:03:08.740 --> 3:03:13.900]  flagrant violations of federal, local, and other laws, and you know, by people who don't
[3:03:13.900 --> 3:03:18.460]  even belong here, somehow you're labeled a racist, like, no, I stand for the rule of
[3:03:18.460 --> 3:03:19.460]  law.
[3:03:19.460 --> 3:03:24.860]  Well, also we have the Catholic Church running around with their diocese pushing for legalization,
[3:03:24.860 --> 3:03:25.860]  and I think that's wrong.
[3:03:25.860 --> 3:03:27.780]  That goes back to what Pastor Smith was saying.
[3:03:27.780 --> 3:03:28.780]  Does that tie into this?
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:29.780]  Absolutely.
[3:03:29.780 --> 3:03:30.780]  Absolutely does.
[3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:37.060]  Even the Pope, when he came here, he chastised Americans and said, we should have, we have
[3:03:37.060 --> 3:03:40.460]  more compassion upon these illegal aliens coming into our country.
[3:03:40.460 --> 3:03:44.380]  But the truth is they don't want to keep them down there so they force a good revolution.
[3:03:44.380 --> 3:03:47.260]  They're using the U.S. as a steam valve.
[3:03:47.260 --> 3:03:48.260]  Yeah.
[3:03:48.260 --> 3:03:49.260]  Absolutely.
[3:03:49.260 --> 3:03:51.620]  Well, thank you so much for that call, Greg.
[3:03:51.620 --> 3:03:52.620]  Anything else?
[3:03:52.620 --> 3:03:54.620]  No, I really, I just take that.
[3:03:54.620 --> 3:03:59.340]  I'm really glad to be a member of the, of the, of the, of the, you know, of the, your,
[3:03:59.340 --> 3:04:02.740]  your subscription service, they learn a lot, and thank you very much.
[3:04:02.740 --> 3:04:03.740]  Thank you.
[3:04:03.740 --> 3:04:07.540]  Well, for prisonplanet.tv is how we finance much of what we do, and it's a great value,
[3:04:07.540 --> 3:04:11.380]  but, and it's a great activist tool, but it also supports us so, so win, win, win, win.
[3:04:11.380 --> 3:04:12.380]  Thank you so much.
[3:04:12.380 --> 3:04:13.380]  Okay.
[3:04:13.380 --> 3:04:14.380]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[3:04:14.380 --> 3:04:16.100]  I'm going to let Pastor David J. Smith go now.
[3:04:16.100 --> 3:04:20.380]  He spent two hours with us today, and I want to have him back up in the near future.
[3:04:20.380 --> 3:04:24.940]  Thank you for your tireless work, sir, for my family, everybody else's family, and the
[3:04:24.940 --> 3:04:27.980]  great work you've done to try to bring people to the Lord.
[3:04:27.980 --> 3:04:31.780]  It's my pleasure, and God bless and keep going.
[3:04:31.780 --> 3:04:32.780]  Take care, my friend.
[3:04:32.780 --> 3:04:33.780]  Thank you.
[3:04:33.780 --> 3:04:34.780]  Bye.
[3:04:34.780 --> 3:04:36.780]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more of your calls first, then a lot

[3:04:45.260 --> 3:04:48.300]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[3:04:48.300 --> 3:04:53.940]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[3:04:53.940 --> 3:04:58.500]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:04:58.500 --> 3:04:59.500]  are synthetic.
[3:04:59.500 --> 3:05:00.900]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:05:00.900 --> 3:05:04.620]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:05:04.620 --> 3:05:09.100]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[3:05:09.100 --> 3:05:10.100]  and mucous membranes.
[3:05:10.100 --> 3:05:16.060]  Now, compare a cow-bin pure soap, all natural, earth-friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal
[3:05:16.060 --> 3:05:20.860]  testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products
[3:05:20.860 --> 3:05:21.860]  now.
[3:05:21.860 --> 3:05:25.340]  You're saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[3:05:25.340 --> 3:05:26.340]  Keep it natural.

[3:05:45.300 --> 3:05:51.500]  It is a big idea, a new world order, in the near future.
[3:05:51.500 --> 3:05:54.500]  Health is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:05:54.500 --> 3:06:00.100]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[3:06:00.100 --> 3:06:03.260]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:06:03.260 --> 3:06:09.180]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:06:09.180 --> 3:06:13.620]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:06:13.620 --> 3:06:18.660]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:06:18.660 --> 3:06:22.900]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:06:22.900 --> 3:06:25.580]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[3:06:25.580 --> 3:06:26.580]  Most people have no idea.
[3:06:26.580 --> 3:06:27.580]  They're not after money.
[3:06:27.580 --> 3:06:28.580]  They have all the money they need.
[3:06:28.580 --> 3:06:29.580]  They're after power.
[3:06:29.580 --> 3:06:30.580]  That's their happenings.

[3:06:36.780 --> 3:06:38.780]  now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:06:38.780 --> 3:06:42.340]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:06:42.340 --> 3:06:44.380]  You have been warned.
[3:06:44.380 --> 3:06:45.940]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[3:06:45.940 --> 3:06:49.660]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[3:06:49.660 --> 3:06:53.900]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one
[3:06:53.900 --> 3:06:55.660]  huge political voting block.
[3:06:55.660 --> 3:06:59.700]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[3:06:59.700 --> 3:07:03.500]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[3:07:03.500 --> 3:07:04.700]  of conscience.
[3:07:04.700 --> 3:07:08.020]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must
[3:07:08.020 --> 3:07:09.100]  be kept separate.
[3:07:09.100 --> 3:07:13.260]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[3:07:13.260 --> 3:07:15.820]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[3:07:15.820 --> 3:07:19.700]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious
[3:07:19.700 --> 3:07:21.100]  intolerance resulted.
[3:07:21.100 --> 3:07:24.980]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[3:07:24.980 --> 3:07:27.820]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[3:07:27.820 --> 3:07:30.260]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[3:07:30.260 --> 3:07:32.100]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:07:32.100 --> 3:07:33.860]  Jesus is coming soon.
[3:07:33.860 --> 3:07:41.140]  For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee
[3:07:41.140 --> 3:07:46.220]  377-71.
[3:07:46.220 --> 3:07:52.780]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:07:52.780 --> 3:08:09.100]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:09.100 --> 3:08:14.380]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:08:14.380 --> 3:08:17.700]  And now I'm going to take some more of your calls, then we've got a big news blitz coming
[3:08:17.700 --> 3:08:18.700]  up.
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:19.700]  I'm going to skip ahead of everybody.
[3:08:19.700 --> 3:08:23.820]  Betty in Florida says she disagrees, so she'll go to the head of the line.
[3:08:23.820 --> 3:08:28.660]  Doesn't matter, my detractors still say all the calls are screened and fake.
[3:08:28.660 --> 3:08:32.260]  And even when they call in themselves, it's all part of the dishonesty and intellectual
[3:08:32.260 --> 3:08:38.580]  bankruptcy of those that claim only they fight the New World Order, no one else.
[3:08:38.580 --> 3:08:40.460]  But let's see if Betty really disagrees or not.
[3:08:40.460 --> 3:08:41.460]  Betty in Florida, go ahead.
[3:08:41.460 --> 3:08:42.460]  Hi, Alex.
[3:08:42.460 --> 3:08:48.780]  Yeah, I rarely do disagree with you, but this time it has to do with when you were talking
[3:08:48.780 --> 3:08:51.580]  about the Catholic Church being part of the New World Order.
[3:08:51.580 --> 3:08:53.580]  Well, I mean, let's be clear here.
[3:08:53.580 --> 3:08:55.420]  I'm not bashing Catholics individually.
[3:08:55.420 --> 3:09:00.620]  I believe Pat Robertson and the main Protestant movements controlled by the New World Order.
[3:09:00.620 --> 3:09:04.620]  I just had David J. Smith on to talk about how, well, I mean, the Catholic Church, no
[3:09:04.620 --> 3:09:07.620]  one can debate that rat singer is calling for a New World Order.
[3:09:07.620 --> 3:09:09.500]  No, I'm not debating that.
[3:09:09.500 --> 3:09:13.980]  What I'm debating is that, and this comes out, this message comes out over your show
[3:09:13.980 --> 3:09:19.260]  quite a bit, whether it's from you or it's from your callers, you've had Hutton Gibson
[3:09:19.260 --> 3:09:20.260]  on your show.
[3:09:20.260 --> 3:09:21.260]  Yes.
[3:09:21.260 --> 3:09:22.260]  I think he's a nice guy.
[3:09:22.260 --> 3:09:23.260]  Right.
[3:09:23.260 --> 3:09:28.740]  And you know that there's a distinction between those who follow the post Vatican II Church
[3:09:28.740 --> 3:09:31.180]  and those who decry it.
[3:09:31.180 --> 3:09:32.580]  Listen, here's the deal.
[3:09:32.580 --> 3:09:33.580]  Here's the deal.
[3:09:33.580 --> 3:09:35.980]  The network runs the ads at once.
[3:09:35.980 --> 3:09:39.380]  Here's a Catholic ad running about how the Catholic Church has been taken over by the
[3:09:39.380 --> 3:09:40.380]  New World Order.
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:41.380]  I have nothing to do with it.
[3:09:41.380 --> 3:09:43.900]  I'm accused of being a Jesuit for that being on.
[3:09:43.900 --> 3:09:48.300]  Then there's another ad that just aired, saying that Papal Rome is taking over and
[3:09:48.300 --> 3:09:50.140]  going to kill us all, basically.
[3:09:50.140 --> 3:09:51.820]  So I'm not involved with that.
[3:09:51.820 --> 3:09:53.380]  And I understand this is divisive.
[3:09:53.380 --> 3:09:57.180]  It's why our movement can never grow and go forward, because everyone is obsessed with
[3:09:57.180 --> 3:09:59.780]  Jews, Catholics, Protestants.
[3:09:59.780 --> 3:10:01.980]  I mean, and I'm not joking when I say this, ma'am.
[3:10:01.980 --> 3:10:04.100]  I'm not joking.
[3:10:04.100 --> 3:10:05.100]  Let me list everything.
[3:10:05.100 --> 3:10:06.100]  Let's not.
[3:10:06.100 --> 3:10:11.100]  We were at the office and by not joking, I mean, this is not made up, but I am joking
[3:10:11.100 --> 3:10:14.220]  in that I think it's funny, but it's also sick.
[3:10:14.220 --> 3:10:19.820]  And I am, according to many people, and let me think of the best way to line it all out.
[3:10:19.820 --> 3:10:21.220]  There's so many to remember.
[3:10:21.220 --> 3:10:32.940]  A reptoid, Scientologist, Jesuit, co-agitator, let me think, well, Zionist, Nazi, CIA, Neanderthal.
[3:10:32.940 --> 3:10:36.980]  There's serious websites that show my head and claim I'm part of a Neanderthal devil
[3:10:36.980 --> 3:10:37.980]  race.
[3:10:37.980 --> 3:10:39.540]  Let me think of the other ones.
[3:10:39.540 --> 3:10:43.500]  Oh, there's a bunch of other ones out there.
[3:10:43.500 --> 3:10:48.260]  And most of our movement, the Liberty movement, just spends its time all day bashing other
[3:10:48.260 --> 3:10:50.020]  groups, saying, this is the leader.
[3:10:50.020 --> 3:10:51.020]  That's the leader.
[3:10:51.020 --> 3:10:52.020]  This person's got it right.
[3:10:52.020 --> 3:10:57.260]  I mean, I had some law websites send me an email yesterday and it just said, I know more
[3:10:57.260 --> 3:10:58.260]  than you.
[3:10:58.260 --> 3:10:59.260]  I'm better than you.
[3:10:59.260 --> 3:11:00.260]  You better call and talk to me.
[3:11:00.260 --> 3:11:01.260]  You never have me on.
[3:11:01.260 --> 3:11:05.180]  You know, I'm going to get you unless you call me.
[3:11:05.180 --> 3:11:06.180]  Get me.
[3:11:06.180 --> 3:11:08.060]  I don't care about you getting me.
[3:11:08.060 --> 3:11:11.820]  You know, the point is, is that I had people call me up.
[3:11:11.820 --> 3:11:12.820]  Oh, let me think.
[3:11:12.820 --> 3:11:17.860]  I'm glad you bring this up, actually, Betty, because I had a guy call me like, or email
[3:11:17.860 --> 3:11:22.180]  me like seven, eight years ago, and it was like, you better interview me.
[3:11:22.180 --> 3:11:24.580]  You've been contacted by my people in heaven.
[3:11:24.580 --> 3:11:28.420]  If you don't, I'm going to expose you as working for the Vatican.
[3:11:28.420 --> 3:11:32.060]  And so I was like, my gosh, and then I didn't know that guy was like the leader of that
[3:11:32.060 --> 3:11:36.020]  movement, which is sad because, you know, the people believe it's legitimate.
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:40.460]  Their leader says flying saucers are controlled by German soldiers and that the earth is on
[3:11:40.460 --> 3:11:43.700]  a string with the universe orbiting it.
[3:11:43.700 --> 3:11:46.060]  And I mean, these people are nuts.
[3:11:46.060 --> 3:11:49.740]  And so I think, well, there must not be truth to the Vatican running it because they're
[3:11:49.740 --> 3:11:54.700]  making all these lies up about me and running around saying I'm a Catholic and a Vatican
[3:11:54.700 --> 3:11:57.140]  agent when I'm not.
[3:11:57.140 --> 3:12:01.380]  And then so I don't talk about it because I've been threatened that I'll be exposed
[3:12:01.380 --> 3:12:02.380]  if I don't.
[3:12:02.380 --> 3:12:06.300]  Well, I don't take the terrorism, you know, so it's kind of a reverse psychology.
[3:12:06.300 --> 3:12:10.700]  It's like if they do think Jesuits run it all, that's how they would actually behave
[3:12:10.700 --> 3:12:15.100]  to act totally insane so no one would then follow them.
[3:12:15.100 --> 3:12:18.140]  And then once people attack you, they can never admit they're wrong, so they always
[3:12:18.140 --> 3:12:22.860]  find other things to add on to it.
[3:12:22.860 --> 3:12:26.660]  But at the same time, Tony Blair has become a Catholic so he can head Europe.
[3:12:26.660 --> 3:12:31.460]  The Catholic Church is calling for a world government and I agree the Catholic Church
[3:12:31.460 --> 3:12:35.020]  has certainly gotten more New World War the last 30, 40 years.
[3:12:35.020 --> 3:12:37.700]  And I agree with Hutton Gibson that it's certainly New World Order now.
[3:12:37.700 --> 3:12:42.060]  Now he writes a book saying the enemy's here, but see that isn't enough for the Catholic
[3:12:42.060 --> 3:12:46.940]  bashers, you know, for Hutton Gibson and others to go and fight what Rome is doing and expose
[3:12:46.940 --> 3:12:49.100]  it, that it is an engine of New World Order.
[3:12:49.100 --> 3:12:51.780]  No, it's got to be all Catholics are going to hell.
[3:12:51.780 --> 3:12:52.780]  You're devils.
[3:12:52.780 --> 3:12:53.780]  We're good.
[3:12:53.780 --> 3:12:54.780]  You're not.
[3:12:54.780 --> 3:13:00.740]  Alex is bad because he doesn't drip with pleasure bashing Catholics or Jews or whatever
[3:13:00.740 --> 3:13:04.140]  group, you know, and so these people are sectarian.
[3:13:04.140 --> 3:13:05.900]  It's always been that way.
[3:13:05.900 --> 3:13:08.100]  And so I'm not saying Catholics are bad people.
[3:13:08.100 --> 3:13:11.620]  I'm not saying they're evil, but the Catholic Church is at the forefront of opening the
[3:13:11.620 --> 3:13:12.620]  borders.
[3:13:12.620 --> 3:13:15.460]  They're at the forefront of gun control in the U.S. there.
[3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:18.980]  I got all these letters from diocese that people mail me saying, you know, turn your
[3:13:18.980 --> 3:13:19.980]  guns in.
[3:13:19.980 --> 3:13:20.980]  It's of the Lord.
[3:13:20.980 --> 3:13:23.780]  You don't need to own guns, but the Protestant churches are doing it too.
[3:13:23.780 --> 3:13:26.300]  So I try to get past labels.
[3:13:26.300 --> 3:13:27.820]  It's just nothing's taboo here.
[3:13:27.820 --> 3:13:30.220]  I mean, I, on air, I said, what do you want to talk about David J. Smith?
[3:13:30.220 --> 3:13:34.540]  And he said, I'm going to talk about Jesuits so he could talk about Jesuits, you know,
[3:13:34.540 --> 3:13:36.620]  this is a free and open forum.
[3:13:36.620 --> 3:13:41.940]  Those that say that we're run by the Zionists or run by the Jesuits or whatever it is that
[3:13:41.940 --> 3:13:43.660]  week, they lie about us.
[3:13:43.660 --> 3:13:45.460]  You know, they say your call was screened.
[3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:49.940]  They say this is a stage call right now, even though they call in, they still say, I've
[3:13:49.940 --> 3:13:53.220]  seen YouTube videos of them call in and go, they're fake stage calls.
[3:13:53.220 --> 3:13:54.940]  I'm going on air now.
[3:13:54.940 --> 3:13:57.260]  You know, I mean, this is the mental illness.
[3:13:57.260 --> 3:13:59.500]  And see, it's because I'm on the tip of the spear.
[3:13:59.500 --> 3:14:02.300]  I'm on the vanguard of fighting them, waking people up.
[3:14:02.300 --> 3:14:07.340]  And I know we're on the radio on 60 plus AM and FM stations and people are driving around
[3:14:07.340 --> 3:14:13.100]  in Colorado and Missouri and Texas and New York and Florida and California on all these
[3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:16.860]  valiant mom and pop stations that pick us up and they're going, what on earth is this
[3:14:16.860 --> 3:14:18.300]  guy talking about this?
[3:14:18.300 --> 3:14:22.220]  These people sound like a bunch of nuts instead of us talking about the fellow reserve being
[3:14:22.220 --> 3:14:26.580]  private and torture and the New World Order and how they're doubling and tripling water
[3:14:26.580 --> 3:14:27.580]  prices.
[3:14:27.580 --> 3:14:31.820]  And, you know, that's why my show has been successful because it is issue oriented.
[3:14:31.820 --> 3:14:36.020]  And then as soon as you mentioned one of these groups, it goes into this big ball of wax
[3:14:36.020 --> 3:14:37.740]  and you can't satisfy any of them.
[3:14:37.740 --> 3:14:41.660]  I could put on a Hitler mustache, how Hitler say Jews are devil seed.
[3:14:41.660 --> 3:14:43.420]  The Nazi groups are still going to attack.
[3:14:43.420 --> 3:14:46.540]  I could say Catholics are seed of Satan running everything.
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:47.940]  It won't satisfy him.
[3:14:47.940 --> 3:14:49.340]  I'm not here to satisfy him.
[3:14:49.340 --> 3:14:50.700]  I'm here to really get at the truth.
[3:14:50.700 --> 3:14:55.140]  I respect David J. Smith and he was saying that he thinks the Jesuits are highly involved
[3:14:55.140 --> 3:14:56.780]  and there's no doubt today they are.
[3:14:56.780 --> 3:14:58.580]  Now I've said my little five minute rant.
[3:14:58.580 --> 3:15:00.180]  You go ahead and make your point.
[3:15:00.180 --> 3:15:01.180]  Thank you.
[3:15:01.180 --> 3:15:02.180]  Go ahead.
[3:15:02.180 --> 3:15:05.540]  I'm not attacking you either, Alex.
[3:15:05.540 --> 3:15:07.780]  I think you're a sincere Christian.
[3:15:07.780 --> 3:15:08.780]  I am.
[3:15:08.780 --> 3:15:09.780]  I'm sincere.
[3:15:09.780 --> 3:15:11.980]  I try to tell the truth and also try to not be divisive.
[3:15:11.980 --> 3:15:19.020]  What I'm trying to do is make the distinction for your listeners that there is a traditional
[3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:23.780]  true Catholic church that still exists and it is not part of the New World Order.
[3:15:23.780 --> 3:15:29.380]  You are very correct that every pope since John the 23rd has been part of it.
[3:15:29.380 --> 3:15:31.220]  They are open heretics.
[3:15:31.220 --> 3:15:33.740]  They were living heretics.
[3:15:33.740 --> 3:15:36.900]  Ratzinger and all his writings is part of the New World Order.
[3:15:36.900 --> 3:15:38.860]  The Jesuits are part of the New World Order.
[3:15:38.860 --> 3:15:41.340]  I don't disagree with that.
[3:15:41.340 --> 3:15:46.980]  What I disagree with is making the generalization that all Catholics are part of it because
[3:15:46.980 --> 3:15:48.620]  they are not.
[3:15:48.620 --> 3:15:53.980]  There are traditional Catholics who follow the traditional teachings of the Catholics.
[3:15:53.980 --> 3:15:54.980]  No, I know that.
[3:15:54.980 --> 3:15:57.060]  I mean, look at the fruits of Hutton Gibson and Mel Gibson.
[3:15:57.060 --> 3:15:58.060]  Exactly.
[3:15:58.060 --> 3:15:59.060]  They're fighting the New World Order.
[3:15:59.060 --> 3:16:01.420]  I know Hutton and his family personally.
[3:16:01.420 --> 3:16:02.580]  They're good people.
[3:16:02.580 --> 3:16:03.580]  They're not bad.
[3:16:03.580 --> 3:16:05.500]  They're fighting what Rome is doing.
[3:16:05.500 --> 3:16:10.380]  But that isn't enough for the people that, I mean, their religion is the Catholics are
[3:16:10.380 --> 3:16:11.620]  the source of all evil.
[3:16:11.620 --> 3:16:13.500]  If they were gone, everybody would be okay.
[3:16:13.500 --> 3:16:14.500]  That's not it.
[3:16:14.500 --> 3:16:16.280]  It's evil in the hearts of men.
[3:16:16.280 --> 3:16:20.260]  They can take over any organization, any group and, and, and Betty, I really appreciate
[3:16:20.260 --> 3:16:23.740]  your call and I'm sorry if what you heard or you heard your feelings.
[3:16:23.740 --> 3:16:29.020]  Listen, I want to fight face scanners going into the bars where everyone must be face
[3:16:29.020 --> 3:16:31.580]  scammed when you go in a bar, when you buy cigarettes.
[3:16:31.580 --> 3:16:32.580]  Okay.
[3:16:32.580 --> 3:16:36.940]  I mean, I mean, that's a pretext to get buy and sell global face scan in as I told you
[3:16:36.940 --> 3:16:37.940]  a decade ago.
[3:16:37.940 --> 3:16:38.940]  They do.
[3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:42.860]  And I don't want to turn Catholics that are listening to show off where they won't go
[3:16:42.860 --> 3:16:47.420]  fight face scanners because they tuned me out because I'm bashing Catholics any more
[3:16:47.420 --> 3:16:49.540]  than the disgusting fake Protestants.
[3:16:49.540 --> 3:16:52.940]  See, I'm non-denominational and then they tell me that's a denomination.
[3:16:52.940 --> 3:16:54.460]  What I mean is I'm not in any group.
[3:16:54.460 --> 3:16:56.140]  I just love Jesus.
[3:16:56.140 --> 3:17:00.220]  And see, then it turns into a show about religion when I'm just trying to cover the news, which
[3:17:00.220 --> 3:17:04.700]  I find to just be a million different groups fighting with each other and all running around
[3:17:04.700 --> 3:17:06.100]  saying they've got the answer.
[3:17:06.100 --> 3:17:11.580]  Listen, man, I'm just somebody going here, Daily Mail, AP, other articles, face scanners
[3:17:11.580 --> 3:17:18.620]  to catch drinkers, you know, I'm, I'm just trying to cover that.
[3:17:18.620 --> 3:17:24.100]  And then I've gotten, you know, threatened by groups, you better say it's Jews or we're
[3:17:24.100 --> 3:17:25.100]  going to kill you.
[3:17:25.100 --> 3:17:29.220]  And I'm like, God, these are really nasty people, or you better say it's the Catholics
[3:17:29.220 --> 3:17:30.220]  or we're going to get you.
[3:17:30.220 --> 3:17:33.500]  And then they just, they engage in such intellectually bankrupt lies.
[3:17:33.500 --> 3:17:37.220]  I mean, they say things about me that are not true.
[3:17:37.220 --> 3:17:44.140]  And it's very painful because, you know, and I've asked all those groups, look, keep
[3:17:44.140 --> 3:17:49.020]  attacking me because if I tell them, don't attack me, they'll think, oh, you don't want
[3:17:49.020 --> 3:17:50.020]  to be attacked.
[3:17:50.020 --> 3:17:51.020]  It must be effective.
[3:17:51.020 --> 3:17:52.180]  We'll redouble it.
[3:17:52.180 --> 3:17:54.820]  It isn't that I individually don't like being attacked.
[3:17:54.820 --> 3:17:58.180]  In fact, it's, it's wrong and it's a sin.
[3:17:58.180 --> 3:18:01.660]  Last night at about midnight, we were winding down work here working on the new film and
[3:18:01.660 --> 3:18:04.660]  I'm going to be showing at the Alamo Draft House coming up this Saturday and Sunday, only
[3:18:04.660 --> 3:18:07.460]  two showings and that's it.
[3:18:07.460 --> 3:18:09.420]  And Burnman starts laughing and I go, what is it?
[3:18:09.420 --> 3:18:15.740]  He's down there working on a film too with Aaron and I walk over and it's a 1950s horror
[3:18:15.740 --> 3:18:22.540]  film cover, very famous, of a woman screaming with her hand up and he goes, look, they say
[3:18:22.540 --> 3:18:25.460]  you are a transvestite and this is you.
[3:18:25.460 --> 3:18:28.940]  And we start laughing, but then I kind of got a sick feeling.
[3:18:28.940 --> 3:18:30.740]  It's not funny.
[3:18:30.740 --> 3:18:34.540]  And then Rob Jacobson gets up and he goes, that's it, you're and he's the one that said
[3:18:34.540 --> 3:18:40.220]  he goes, you are a Neanderthal transvestite, Vatican assassin, Zionist, Nazi, because
[3:18:40.220 --> 3:18:44.380]  they say I'm a Nazi too, Scientologist, reptoid.
[3:18:44.380 --> 3:18:47.700]  And we all literally started laughing so hard we were crying.
[3:18:47.700 --> 3:18:51.780]  But then at the end of it, I just said, this isn't funny.
[3:18:51.780 --> 3:18:58.380]  You know, I mean, we can individually laugh about this, but that our movement is not the
[3:18:58.380 --> 3:19:02.660]  general listeners, not the main group, but, but, but so much of what's on YouTube and
[3:19:02.660 --> 3:19:05.260]  the web is just bedlam, man.
[3:19:05.260 --> 3:19:08.220]  It's just absolute bedlam.
[3:19:08.220 --> 3:19:13.180]  And then each group that, you know, the Zionist group or the Catholics do it all group, they'll
[3:19:13.180 --> 3:19:18.100]  then say, well, don't mix me in with the reptoids and the Neanderthal people and this, you know,
[3:19:18.100 --> 3:19:21.580]  we're being serious, but it's not serious.
[3:19:21.580 --> 3:19:22.580]  And you know what?
[3:19:22.580 --> 3:19:27.380]  I can even send the person the 1950s horror poster that that's not me with a wig on in
[3:19:27.380 --> 3:19:28.380]  drag.
[3:19:28.380 --> 3:19:29.380]  It doesn't matter.
[3:19:29.380 --> 3:19:34.860]  It's nothing to say it's not me ever because they've committed to saying I'm this bad thing.
[3:19:34.860 --> 3:19:37.540]  They're invested in that and they're never going to go back.
[3:19:37.540 --> 3:19:41.460]  So I just want them to expose at least mercury and vaccines or a few things like keep spending
[3:19:41.460 --> 3:19:45.500]  your time on me, but redouble your efforts and do some good too.
[3:19:45.500 --> 3:19:49.740]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[3:19:49.740 --> 3:19:53.460]  Vaccines included medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[3:19:53.460 --> 3:19:58.340]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually with a worst
[3:19:58.340 --> 3:20:00.340]  toll taken by antibiotics.
[3:20:00.340 --> 3:20:04.700]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret oxy silver developed
[3:20:04.700 --> 3:20:09.980]  by NASA scientists to keep astronauts healthy is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making
[3:20:09.980 --> 3:20:15.380]  deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete, taking one to two teaspoons daily boosts natural
[3:20:15.380 --> 3:20:17.780]  immunity without drug toxicity.
[3:20:17.780 --> 3:20:20.780]  Oxy silver combines oxygen and silver in a new way.
[3:20:20.780 --> 3:20:25.780]  The oxygen becomes a supercharged germ killer freeing your immune system to fight colds,
[3:20:25.780 --> 3:20:31.260]  blues, cancers and more, build disease defenses naturally, painlessly, powerfully, safely,
[3:20:31.260 --> 3:20:33.700]  and inexpensively with oxy silver.

[3:20:43.620 --> 3:20:44.620]  Do it now.
[3:20:44.620 --> 3:20:45.620]  It is a big idea.
[3:20:45.620 --> 3:20:46.620]  A new world order.
[3:20:46.620 --> 3:20:47.620]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:20:47.620 --> 3:21:00.260]  It's known as the builder bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:21:00.260 --> 3:21:03.420]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:21:03.420 --> 3:21:08.420]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:21:08.420 --> 3:21:13.780]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:13.780 --> 3:21:19.220]  Over the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:21:19.220 --> 3:21:23.100]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:21:23.100 --> 3:21:25.780]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:21:25.780 --> 3:21:27.540]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[3:21:27.540 --> 3:21:28.540]  They have all the money they need.
[3:21:28.540 --> 3:21:29.540]  They're after power.
[3:21:29.540 --> 3:21:30.540]  Yes, they're after easier.

[3:21:37.540 --> 3:21:38.540]  at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:21:38.540 --> 3:21:42.540]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:21:42.540 --> 3:21:43.540]  You have been warned.
[3:21:43.540 --> 3:21:47.700]  The election cycle draws near, and we don't have much time left.
[3:21:47.700 --> 3:21:51.700]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now
[3:21:51.700 --> 3:21:54.940]  with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[3:21:54.940 --> 3:21:58.980]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[3:21:58.980 --> 3:22:04.580]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging, educating,
[3:22:04.580 --> 3:22:08.460]  and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[3:22:08.460 --> 3:22:12.580]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related
[3:22:12.580 --> 3:22:16.420]  spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[3:22:16.420 --> 3:22:19.860]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with
[3:22:19.860 --> 3:22:24.460]  only two choices, be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[3:22:24.460 --> 3:22:27.820]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since freedom
[3:22:27.820 --> 3:22:31.980]  to fascism, and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
[3:22:31.980 --> 3:22:33.740]  We invite you to make the change.
[3:22:33.740 --> 3:22:35.500]  Help take back our government now.
[3:22:35.500 --> 3:22:39.780]  Go to takebackwashington.com and get the tools you need for the information war.
[3:22:39.780 --> 3:22:41.900]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[3:22:41.900 --> 3:22:44.180]  Go to takebackwashington.com.
[3:22:44.180 --> 3:22:49.060]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned
[3:22:49.060 --> 3:22:50.060]  TV on your computer?
[3:22:50.060 --> 3:22:55.100]  Well, now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows
[3:22:55.100 --> 3:22:59.920]  computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch without paying
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:02.260]  monthly cable or satellite fees.
[3:23:02.260 --> 3:23:03.340]  Here's the story.
[3:23:03.340 --> 3:23:07.580]  New video feed technology lets anyone with a high-speed internet connection gain instant
[3:23:07.580 --> 3:23:11.500]  access to an endless list of underground channels from all over the globe.
[3:23:11.500 --> 3:23:14.420]  And here's the best part, it's 100% legal.
[3:23:14.420 --> 3:23:18.780]  And it works at home, the office, or even in other countries to grab television channels
[3:23:18.780 --> 3:23:20.660]  and video feeds at your command.
[3:23:20.660 --> 3:23:25.540]  GCN listeners can use it to watch hundreds of conspiracy videos absolutely free.
[3:23:25.540 --> 3:23:29.980]  Best of all, you can be watching free TV on your PC in five minutes or less.
[3:23:29.980 --> 3:23:31.140]  It's that simple.
[3:23:31.140 --> 3:23:34.820]  Just go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[3:23:34.820 --> 3:23:37.940]  That's www.orderfreetv.com.
[3:23:37.940 --> 3:23:44.940]  To watch unregulated TV on your PC, go to www.orderfreetv.com.
[3:24:07.940 --> 3:24:10.140]  All right, let's try to move through your calls a little bit quicker.
[3:24:10.140 --> 3:24:14.260]  I apologize to new listeners all across the country that had no idea what that whole discussion
[3:24:14.260 --> 3:24:15.980]  was earlier.
[3:24:15.980 --> 3:24:18.540]  Any movement's also going to have schizophrenics attracted to it.
[3:24:18.540 --> 3:24:23.340]  I mean, when the government's on TV saying everybody should be forced to take microchips,
[3:24:23.340 --> 3:24:27.140]  then that makes all the schizophrenics say, see, I told you, they put chips in me and
[3:24:27.140 --> 3:24:30.180]  maybe some of those that are schizophrenics really weren't schizophrenics and were under
[3:24:30.180 --> 3:24:31.180]  mind control.
[3:24:31.180 --> 3:24:34.820]  But you just got a lot of crazies out there and this freeing up of the media is part of
[3:24:34.820 --> 3:24:38.500]  them having a venue and some can say that about me.
[3:24:38.500 --> 3:24:42.740]  But I'm glad that we're having a larger open debate about all these subjects.
[3:24:42.740 --> 3:24:47.140]  I would just ask people that if you're going to engage in the morbidity of just attacking
[3:24:47.140 --> 3:24:51.660]  a bunch of innocent people and making crap up, spend as much time attacking a new world
[3:24:51.660 --> 3:24:54.820]  order and actually warning and waking up new people.
[3:24:54.820 --> 3:24:56.820]  That way you can have your cake and eat it, too.
[3:24:56.820 --> 3:25:01.180]  There's few things in life, frankly, I still need the entertainment in a sick way, so don't
[3:25:01.180 --> 3:25:02.180]  stop.
[3:25:02.180 --> 3:25:07.140]  You can increase your attacks on me a little, but then separately is a moral thing.
[3:25:07.140 --> 3:25:12.860]  Spend time, you know, actually on something you can prove and something we can do, okay?
[3:25:12.860 --> 3:25:14.180]  And I've listed a lot of those issues.
[3:25:14.180 --> 3:25:15.500]  Okay, I'm already digressing.
[3:25:15.500 --> 3:25:16.500]  It doesn't matter.
[3:25:16.500 --> 3:25:21.900]  Let's talk to John in Texas and Robert, Mike, Haley and Evian and that's it.
[3:25:21.900 --> 3:25:22.900]  Go ahead, John.
[3:25:22.900 --> 3:25:25.020]  Oh, and then it looks over here, too.
[3:25:25.020 --> 3:25:26.020]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3:25:26.020 --> 3:25:30.060]  Yeah, I was going to say that I want to be at the film premiere this weekend.
[3:25:30.060 --> 3:25:32.140]  I'm looking forward to it.
[3:25:32.140 --> 3:25:33.140]  Thank you.
[3:25:33.140 --> 3:25:37.660]  And my question was for Pastor Smith, but he's gone now, and he brought up the Knights
[3:25:37.660 --> 3:25:42.220]  of Malta and, you know, the Jesuits and things, and I'm not a Catholic.
[3:25:42.220 --> 3:25:43.420]  No doubt it's new world order.
[3:25:43.420 --> 3:25:44.420]  No one's debating.
[3:25:44.420 --> 3:25:46.260]  You heard a Catholic earlier say it is.
[3:25:46.260 --> 3:25:50.500]  Okay, I'm not a Catholic and I'm not doing anything of that nature, but he brought Knights
[3:25:50.500 --> 3:25:51.500]  of Malta up.
[3:25:51.500 --> 3:25:56.180]  And my question was about Patrick Buchanan, who's written all these sincere books about
[3:25:56.180 --> 3:26:01.860]  us losing our sovereignty and our borders and NAFTA and these bad trade deals.
[3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:05.780]  And he's even spoken out harshly against the new world order on TV.
[3:26:05.780 --> 3:26:11.100]  I've seen him, but I also know he belongs to the Knights of Malta.
[3:26:11.100 --> 3:26:17.260]  And if there's any elaboration there, I mean, should we believe he's sincere?
[3:26:17.260 --> 3:26:18.260]  I really don't know.
[3:26:18.260 --> 3:26:21.500]  Well, you've got to judge somebody by their entire track record, and the stuff he did
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:23.500]  with Nixon is not good.
[3:26:23.500 --> 3:26:26.500]  But ever since then, he's done nothing but good stuff.
[3:26:26.500 --> 3:26:28.540]  People claim that I'm best buddies with him.
[3:26:28.540 --> 3:26:35.180]  I have met Pat Buchanan once at a Republican debate in 96 or was it earlier than that?
[3:26:35.180 --> 3:26:39.620]  And then it becomes their own little inquisition of, you know, have you ever known a communist?
[3:26:39.620 --> 3:26:40.620]  Did you ever know one?
[3:26:40.620 --> 3:26:42.860]  It's like McCarthyism.
[3:26:42.860 --> 3:26:46.460]  But we've interviewed Buchanan, and we're also supposed to not interview anybody that's
[3:26:46.460 --> 3:26:48.900]  Jewish for the anti-Zionist groups.
[3:26:48.900 --> 3:26:52.300]  And then we're also not supposed to interview anybody that's Catholic, then they put a whole
[3:26:52.300 --> 3:26:55.940]  list of whoever you've interviewed that's Catholic and then it's some great evil.
[3:26:55.940 --> 3:26:57.660]  Then they ask, how do you interview Buchanan?
[3:26:57.660 --> 3:26:58.660]  How do you get him?
[3:26:58.660 --> 3:27:02.980]  Well, you lazy jackasses, when he has a new book come out, could call the publisher and
[3:27:02.980 --> 3:27:04.820]  say, I'd like to interview him.
[3:27:04.820 --> 3:27:05.820]  That's how it works.
[3:27:05.820 --> 3:27:09.020]  Publishers every day mail us books and want us to interview these people.
[3:27:09.020 --> 3:27:12.540]  That's how I got that Rothschild on and then attacked him because he had a new book out
[3:27:12.540 --> 3:27:14.300]  and people said, look, he's got a Rothschild on.
[3:27:14.300 --> 3:27:15.380]  He's in league with him.
[3:27:15.380 --> 3:27:17.780]  See, I'm asking people to be adult.
[3:27:17.780 --> 3:27:21.020]  The point is Buchanan's putting out books that wake you up to the New World Order.
[3:27:21.020 --> 3:27:22.860]  You can use that book to wake people up.
[3:27:22.860 --> 3:27:24.980]  The book doesn't have anything bad in it.
[3:27:24.980 --> 3:27:31.380]  And so, no, I don't think he is, see, it's not the lower or even mid-level people in
[3:27:31.380 --> 3:27:32.380]  any of these groups.
[3:27:32.380 --> 3:27:36.420]  It's the high ups and the New World Order runs all the major groups.
[3:27:36.420 --> 3:27:39.700]  So if you just say it's this group or that group, you fall into their hands.
[3:27:39.700 --> 3:27:42.100]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown said that in his book.
[3:27:42.100 --> 3:27:45.540]  He said, they can never beat us because they think it's one group or the other when we've
[3:27:45.540 --> 3:27:48.100]  got all the big major groups.
[3:27:48.100 --> 3:27:51.620]  We got to get the people together to fight back against them on a larger scale.
[3:27:51.620 --> 3:27:56.500]  Yeah, and I'd like to make a point about this all, the part of our movement, when it comes
[3:27:56.500 --> 3:28:01.500]  to religious aspects, there's a part of our movement in films and books that dispute whether
[3:28:01.500 --> 3:28:04.020]  Jesus actually ever walked on the earth or-
[3:28:04.020 --> 3:28:05.500]  Yeah, that's Zeitgeist.
[3:28:05.500 --> 3:28:08.260]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[3:28:08.260 --> 3:28:09.260]  I got to jump.
[3:28:09.260 --> 3:28:11.060]  That guy used clips of me on the internet.
[3:28:11.060 --> 3:28:12.220]  I get attacked for that.
[3:28:12.220 --> 3:28:13.780]  Why are you in Zeitgeist?
[3:28:13.780 --> 3:28:15.780]  Why am I in 10 million videos on the web?
[3:28:15.780 --> 3:28:18.540]  They took my stuff and put it in there.
[3:28:18.540 --> 3:28:21.220]  You know, but again, it's this inquisitor thing.
[3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:25.460]  I wish everybody would go inquisit their mayor, their county commissioner.
[3:28:25.460 --> 3:28:30.100]  I wish you'd go find out the public schools teaching the kids how to spy on you, but you
[3:28:30.100 --> 3:28:31.100]  won't do that.
[3:28:31.100 --> 3:28:34.780]  It's easier just to lazily say that I'm in league with the Tooth Fairy.
[3:28:34.780 --> 3:28:35.980]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:28:35.980 --> 3:28:37.620]  Robin, Florida, you're on the air.
[3:28:37.620 --> 3:28:40.260]  Hi, I like first time caller.
[3:28:40.260 --> 3:28:41.260]  Welcome.
[3:28:41.260 --> 3:28:42.740]  I don't know what that was.
[3:28:42.740 --> 3:28:46.860]  Well, the first time caller just recently been turned on to your stuff.
[3:28:46.860 --> 3:28:52.660]  I am a graduate of a seminary, a Baptist seminary from out in North Texas.
[3:28:52.660 --> 3:28:58.980]  And just wondering what you think about as far as reasons why our government goes after
[3:28:58.980 --> 3:29:05.540]  these other dictators like Manuel Noriega, you can, the new list goes on and on.
[3:29:05.540 --> 3:29:10.660]  What is the reason behind him going after these other dictators to promote these wars?
[3:29:10.660 --> 3:29:11.660]  Stay there.
[3:29:11.660 --> 3:29:12.660]  Stay there.
[3:29:12.660 --> 3:29:13.660]  I'm going to come right back to you on the other side.
[3:29:13.660 --> 3:29:20.940]  Great question, and Rob, and then we'll go to Mike, Haley, and Evian, and that's going
[3:29:20.940 --> 3:29:21.940]  to be it for calls.
[3:29:21.940 --> 3:29:25.060]  So I got a bunch of news I want to play, and we're going to go out with this video, the
[3:29:25.060 --> 3:29:27.140]  New World Order on trial.
[3:29:27.140 --> 3:29:35.420]  Stay with me, President Planet.TV members, we'll be right back.
[3:29:35.420 --> 3:29:39.180]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[3:29:39.180 --> 3:29:45.340]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:45.340 --> 3:29:52.300]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[3:29:52.300 --> 3:29:55.820]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead
[3:29:55.820 --> 3:29:58.100]  of what's fair for the American people.
[3:29:58.100 --> 3:30:01.940]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[3:31:51.340 --> 3:31:52.340]  Hemp.
[3:31:52.340 --> 3:31:55.060]  Used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[3:31:55.060 --> 3:31:56.060]  Hemp.
[3:31:56.060 --> 3:31:59.460]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow
[3:31:59.460 --> 3:32:02.460]  for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[3:32:02.460 --> 3:32:05.940]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[3:32:10.100 --> 3:32:13.940]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many

[3:33:07.940 --> 3:33:12.940]  Let us now go back to the calls.
[3:33:12.940 --> 3:33:16.660]  Sometimes during break, I forget what I was talking about running around doing things during
[3:33:16.660 --> 3:33:17.900]  the break.
[3:33:17.900 --> 3:33:24.340]  I think we were talking to Rob in Florida, that's right, he was asking about why do
[3:33:24.340 --> 3:33:25.340]  they go take out dictators.
[3:33:25.340 --> 3:33:29.420]  Okay, let me try to give you my answer to this and get your take on it or any follow-up
[3:33:29.420 --> 3:33:32.700]  questions, Rob.
[3:33:32.700 --> 3:33:36.340]  And it's basically just this.
[3:33:36.340 --> 3:33:37.620]  They're good, bad and different.
[3:33:37.620 --> 3:33:42.880]  They don't care if a nation really is run by a thug or run by an angel or run by a mix
[3:33:42.880 --> 3:33:45.420]  of in between as it normally is.
[3:33:45.420 --> 3:33:51.500]  They just want a client state that will follow orders.
[3:33:51.500 --> 3:33:55.900]  They want a client state that will do the will of the new world order.
[3:33:55.900 --> 3:34:00.860]  And of Manuel Noriega, who they openly worked with, George Bush Sr. met with and openly
[3:34:00.860 --> 3:34:07.820]  worked with CIA and he owned giant palaces in Switzerland and France and one next door
[3:34:07.820 --> 3:34:13.020]  to the bushes and laundered the money and he publicly stopped paying his cocaine cut.
[3:34:13.020 --> 3:34:15.700]  And they just had a huge military invasion a few months later.
[3:34:15.700 --> 3:34:19.340]  And they announced that some of our women had been kidnapped and we have interviews
[3:34:19.340 --> 3:34:20.340]  with the women.
[3:34:20.340 --> 3:34:21.420]  They said, we were never kidnapped.
[3:34:21.420 --> 3:34:24.060]  Special forces showed up and said, stay inside our house.
[3:34:24.060 --> 3:34:29.700]  They were there to protect us and the gunships an hour later attacked.
[3:34:29.700 --> 3:34:34.300]  So whenever I say we shouldn't attack Iran, that doesn't mean I'm even defending Iran.
[3:34:34.300 --> 3:34:35.820]  Most governments are wicked and evil.
[3:34:35.820 --> 3:34:38.820]  That's the nature of governments and powerful type people that are willing to do what it
[3:34:38.820 --> 3:34:40.380]  takes to get into power.
[3:34:40.380 --> 3:34:42.940]  They're intelligent, but also ruthless.
[3:34:42.940 --> 3:34:47.220]  But you have the globalist, it's like a global risk game and they've almost got all the countries
[3:34:47.220 --> 3:34:50.140]  on the table, but a few, quote, rogue nations.
[3:34:50.140 --> 3:34:53.180]  Some of those nations are good, some are bad, some are in between.
[3:34:53.180 --> 3:34:57.380]  The point is the globalists want a monopoly so that they have total control across the
[3:34:57.380 --> 3:34:58.580]  planet.
[3:34:58.580 --> 3:35:01.780]  And they say that that's what they want.
[3:35:01.780 --> 3:35:04.820]  So that's why they overthrow dictators and put other dictators in.
[3:35:04.820 --> 3:35:11.100]  I mean, all over the world, the United States, again, a unit of the Anglo-American Empire,
[3:35:11.100 --> 3:35:15.940]  regardless of who's running it, we know it's the Anglo-American Empire, they go around
[3:35:15.940 --> 3:35:20.600]  overthrowing nations and actually putting dictators in.
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:24.980]  The Arabs were somewhat secular in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s.
[3:35:24.980 --> 3:35:29.260]  And the public U.S. policy was to go in and fund radical, mainly Wahhabist, that a British
[3:35:29.260 --> 3:35:35.100]  controlled and created Saudi Arabia, to radically go in and machine-gun bomb kill as a shock
[3:35:35.100 --> 3:35:36.100]  force.
[3:35:36.100 --> 3:35:39.340]  They used those on all the other Arab and a bunch of Central Asian countries and took
[3:35:39.340 --> 3:35:44.980]  them over, then had the same group attack the Russians in 79 to get them to attack Afghanistan.
[3:35:44.980 --> 3:35:48.780]  That's admitted history, but nobody knows that they think Russians just attacked.
[3:35:48.780 --> 3:35:50.460]  And again, not defending the Russians.
[3:35:50.460 --> 3:35:51.620]  They were evil as well.
[3:35:51.620 --> 3:35:53.260]  See, that's what confuses people.
[3:35:53.260 --> 3:35:55.060]  It's like, well, are you for us or the Russians?
[3:35:55.060 --> 3:35:59.300]  Well, no, it was the Russians were corrupt empire, but then the globalists went and attacked
[3:35:59.300 --> 3:36:00.740]  them to get them to come in.
[3:36:00.740 --> 3:36:06.140]  And at a higher level, that was all a game, too, to really play off the nations, the Central
[3:36:06.140 --> 3:36:09.020]  Asian nations and keep them from industrializing.
[3:36:09.020 --> 3:36:10.540]  That was meant to wreck infrastructure.
[3:36:10.540 --> 3:36:15.500]  It was also meant to bankrupt Russia to bring further banker control in.
[3:36:15.500 --> 3:36:16.820]  So this is how they operate.
[3:36:16.820 --> 3:36:21.340]  It's like they use the Muslims to attack the Serbs, because they were sovereign.
[3:36:21.340 --> 3:36:23.900]  So does that answer your question, sir?
[3:36:23.900 --> 3:36:24.900]  That certainly does.
[3:36:24.900 --> 3:36:30.140]  The reason why I asked that is because from my heritage, my grandmother immigrated here
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:31.140]  from Panama.
[3:36:31.140 --> 3:36:35.220]  My grandfather was stationed in the Panama Canal during World War II.
[3:36:35.220 --> 3:36:39.660]  And my great uncle, who was still living in Panama at the time, he was with the gut, was
[3:36:39.660 --> 3:36:45.460]  high up in the government of Panama before Noriega took over and had to flee the country
[3:36:45.460 --> 3:36:49.820]  for his life because once Noriega gained power, he basically was exterminating anyone who
[3:36:49.820 --> 3:36:53.700]  was a dissident to his rule.
[3:36:53.700 --> 3:37:01.740]  And it's just kind of having known the United States' dealings with Noriega kind of a matter
[3:37:01.740 --> 3:37:07.900]  of hypocrisy that they will deal with somebody and then turn around and go and then depose
[3:37:07.900 --> 3:37:08.900]  them.
[3:37:08.900 --> 3:37:11.460]  Well, I agree, but it's not even hypocrisy.
[3:37:11.460 --> 3:37:12.460]  This is a plan.
[3:37:12.460 --> 3:37:15.540]  I mean, there's declassified textbooks on this.
[3:37:15.540 --> 3:37:16.540]  Of course.
[3:37:16.540 --> 3:37:22.540]  I didn't want the poet that spoke five languages and had a hundred and seventy IQ and was secular.
[3:37:22.540 --> 3:37:27.060]  Mohamed Mosadek was pro-U.S. and trained in the West as a president.
[3:37:27.060 --> 3:37:30.980]  They sent in Wahhabist Muslims into the Shiite Iran.
[3:37:30.980 --> 3:37:32.860]  They sent Al Qaeda in.
[3:37:32.860 --> 3:37:37.860]  The British intel with the section chiefs, the CIA commander, Kermit Roosevelt, grandson
[3:37:37.860 --> 3:37:39.980]  of the president, and they wrote books about it.
[3:37:39.980 --> 3:37:43.220]  It's all declassified and they staged terror attacks and blamed it on him.
[3:37:43.220 --> 3:37:46.500]  They bombed Mosque and blamed it on him, a reverse false flag.
[3:37:46.500 --> 3:37:51.380]  Very complex, but to implement, but they admit they did it.
[3:37:51.380 --> 3:37:53.540]  And it's the same thing.
[3:37:53.540 --> 3:37:56.980]  It isn't that they deal with dictators.
[3:37:56.980 --> 3:38:03.060]  They got Saddam when he was 18, top of his class, military academy, well-known secular
[3:38:03.060 --> 3:38:04.780]  family.
[3:38:04.780 --> 3:38:13.260]  They sent him to Egypt for four years in CIA, encoding espionage, explosives as a commander.
[3:38:13.260 --> 3:38:17.900]  He helped run hit teams that killed hundreds of the Socialist Bath Party.
[3:38:17.900 --> 3:38:19.400]  He was unstoppable.
[3:38:19.400 --> 3:38:23.060]  Then the Bathists came to the U.S. and said, we now want to do whatever you say.
[3:38:23.060 --> 3:38:26.780]  He machine gunned the president, shot him twice, almost killed him.
[3:38:26.780 --> 3:38:31.700]  So they came and said, look, stop trying to kill us in the U.S., the control of the globalist.
[3:38:31.700 --> 3:38:38.180]  This is all declassified public, said, okay, put our man, now 30-something years old, Saddam
[3:38:38.180 --> 3:38:44.700]  Hussein in 1969, trained in 48 through 52, in Egypt by the CIA.
[3:38:44.700 --> 3:38:45.700]  This is all admitted.
[3:38:45.700 --> 3:38:49.780]  They said, put him in power as the head of Bath Security and we'll stop trying to kill
[3:38:49.780 --> 3:38:50.780]  you.
[3:38:50.780 --> 3:38:51.780]  So they made a deal.
[3:38:51.780 --> 3:38:55.860]  They then, once he got his people in place, the globalists then were treacherous, killed
[3:38:55.860 --> 3:39:01.620]  the Bathists leadership, put Saddam in a pure CIA slash Israeli government.
[3:39:01.620 --> 3:39:02.700]  Now they were in place.
[3:39:02.700 --> 3:39:06.740]  They started a war with Iran, hundreds of billions, but he owed $35 billion.
[3:39:06.740 --> 3:39:08.980]  He over-pumped oil to try to pay off his debts.
[3:39:08.980 --> 3:39:10.740]  He then wanted to actually be a leader.
[3:39:10.740 --> 3:39:12.460]  They said, no, you work for us.
[3:39:12.460 --> 3:39:14.140]  Then he said, well, I'm going to invade Kuwait.
[3:39:14.140 --> 3:39:15.140]  They're stealing oil.
[3:39:15.140 --> 3:39:16.140]  They said, go ahead.
[3:39:16.140 --> 3:39:17.140]  We're behind you.
[3:39:17.140 --> 3:39:21.140]  Then they set him up, claimed he threw babies out of incubators, put out fake PR, went and
[3:39:21.140 --> 3:39:22.220]  attacked him.
[3:39:22.220 --> 3:39:26.740]  They've been running 18 years of siege, killed over 3 million Iraqis, a million plus since
[3:39:26.740 --> 3:39:29.460]  the last five and a half years of invasion.
[3:39:29.460 --> 3:39:30.460]  It's a huge blackout.
[3:39:30.460 --> 3:39:34.740]  They're building bases all over to carry out regional extermination ops, and even in
[3:39:34.740 --> 3:39:41.860]  government documents, they are genocide citadels, armored techno citadels that then direct the
[3:39:41.860 --> 3:39:45.860]  turning Iraq into a stone age nation.
[3:39:45.860 --> 3:39:50.580]  Then they roll in with the UN forces as the saviors later after a decade of US occupation
[3:39:50.580 --> 3:39:55.980]  with forced inoculations, sterilization compounds, further blackout, which they mean to roll
[3:39:55.980 --> 3:40:00.900]  into Iran, Syria, and every other Arab nation to carry out eugenics operations against
[3:40:00.900 --> 3:40:01.900]  them.
[3:40:01.900 --> 3:40:04.620]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[3:40:04.620 --> 3:40:05.620]  It sure does.
[3:40:05.620 --> 3:40:06.620]  Okay.
[3:40:06.620 --> 3:40:09.700]  That's the blackout, totally evil, but the globalist, I appreciate your call.
[3:40:09.700 --> 3:40:11.300]  We'll say, well, that's why we're in control.
[3:40:11.300 --> 3:40:12.340]  We're willing to do this.
[3:40:12.340 --> 3:40:14.220]  We got the organizational skills to do it.
[3:40:14.220 --> 3:40:15.780]  We got the institutions to do it.
[3:40:15.780 --> 3:40:18.460]  And by the way, we're going to do it to you too, Americans, and you're going to love
[3:40:18.460 --> 3:40:19.460]  it.
[3:40:19.460 --> 3:40:20.460]  Okay.
[3:40:20.460 --> 3:40:21.460]  Enjoy your cancer.
[3:40:21.460 --> 3:40:22.460]  All right.
[3:40:22.460 --> 3:40:24.100]  It's all part of the freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:40:24.100 --> 3:40:25.820]  That's why I don't even, I want to live.
[3:40:25.820 --> 3:40:28.780]  I don't want to die, but I'm not even worried if they kill me anymore because it's like,
[3:40:28.780 --> 3:40:29.780]  you got to fight these people.
[3:40:29.780 --> 3:40:33.900]  I mean, this is the most diabolical stuff that anybody could ever come up with.
[3:40:33.900 --> 3:40:39.780]  I mean, it's just, oh God, they always betray their minions.
[3:40:39.780 --> 3:40:43.180]  Just like they create the Mujahideen 80 years ago.
[3:40:43.180 --> 3:40:45.140]  They use them to take over regional areas.
[3:40:45.140 --> 3:40:46.780]  They use them against Russia.
[3:40:46.780 --> 3:40:48.500]  They use them against Iran.
[3:40:48.500 --> 3:40:49.500]  They're using them.
[3:40:49.500 --> 3:40:52.620]  And the government admits they're using, quote, al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[3:40:52.620 --> 3:40:55.420]  They've been bombing mosque, blowing up government buildings.
[3:40:55.420 --> 3:41:02.020]  Right now, Iran's suing the US because they said, you publicly admit you find al-Qaeda.
[3:41:02.020 --> 3:41:05.580]  They're so sick, how dumb they treat us.
[3:41:05.580 --> 3:41:06.580]  You know what?
[3:41:06.580 --> 3:41:07.860]  I'm just going to play this right now and then go to your calls because I don't want
[3:41:07.860 --> 3:41:10.300]  to run out of time and miss this.
[3:41:10.300 --> 3:41:11.740]  This is the New World Order on trial.
[3:41:11.740 --> 3:41:14.660]  It's up on infowars.com.
[3:41:14.660 --> 3:41:16.620]  Right now, it is really good.
[3:41:16.620 --> 3:41:21.700]  If you're a prison, planet.tv member, you can see the video of this right now.
[3:41:21.700 --> 3:41:25.540]  So go sign up at prisonplanet.tv if you have not yet become a member because this fourth
[3:41:25.540 --> 3:41:30.220]  hour, or like yesterday, we did three hours live, hour and a half with Galen Ross and hour
[3:41:30.220 --> 3:41:31.620]  and a half with myself.
[3:41:31.620 --> 3:41:35.980]  And then we post these later if you don't watch it live at prisonplanet.tv for members.
[3:41:35.980 --> 3:41:37.500]  And by the way, there's a lot of good shows.
[3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:40.100]  There's like 20 plus of them archive now.
[3:41:40.100 --> 3:41:43.900]  They're on prisonplanet.tv that a lot of you probably haven't seen, so be sure and get those
[3:41:43.900 --> 3:41:46.300]  and make copies of them, put them on disk.
[3:41:46.300 --> 3:41:50.820]  The file size isn't too big and you can get them out to people.
[3:41:50.820 --> 3:41:55.340]  Let's see, I figured out their formula by reading their own documents and I'm just trying to
[3:41:55.340 --> 3:41:56.340]  warn people.
[3:41:56.340 --> 3:41:57.340]  That's all I'm trying to do.
[3:41:57.340 --> 3:42:01.300]  You can figure out who's behind it and what the penultimate goal is and the rest of it
[3:42:01.300 --> 3:42:02.300]  yourself.
[3:42:02.300 --> 3:42:04.660]  I'm just exposing how they operate, what they're doing.
[3:42:04.660 --> 3:42:06.820]  I'm going to go ahead and go to this now.
[3:42:06.820 --> 3:42:10.500]  Here it is, new world order on trial.
[3:42:10.500 --> 3:42:34.060]  What is at stake is more than one small country.
[3:42:34.060 --> 3:42:40.900]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:42:40.900 --> 3:42:48.180]  Out of these double times, our fifth objective, the new world order can emerge.
[3:42:48.180 --> 3:42:54.940]  Now we can see a new world coming into view, a world in which there is a very real prospect
[3:42:54.940 --> 3:42:56.820]  of a new world order.
[3:42:56.820 --> 3:43:02.860]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a
[3:43:02.860 --> 3:43:10.020]  new world order, a world for the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct
[3:43:10.020 --> 3:43:12.020]  of nations.
[3:43:12.020 --> 3:43:18.300]  When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order
[3:43:18.300 --> 3:43:42.980]  in order.
[3:43:42.980 --> 3:43:49.420]  This is no fantasy, no careless product of wild imagination.
[3:43:49.420 --> 3:44:02.500]  No, my good friends, these indictments that I brought you today, specific charges listed
[3:44:02.500 --> 3:44:12.740]  herein against the individuals, their acts of treason, their ultimate aim of sedition.
[3:44:12.740 --> 3:44:21.220]  These are matters of undeniable fact.
[3:44:21.220 --> 3:44:35.340]  I ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused.
[3:44:35.340 --> 3:44:43.140]  And this, this mindless aberration, whose only means of expression are wanton violence
[3:44:43.140 --> 3:44:45.620]  and destruction.
[3:44:45.620 --> 3:44:51.180]  Once trusted by this council, charged with maintaining the defense of the planet itself,
[3:44:51.180 --> 3:44:56.900]  chief architect of this intended revolution and author of this insidious plot to establish
[3:44:56.900 --> 3:45:05.620]  a new order amongst us, with himself as absolute ruler.
[3:45:05.620 --> 3:45:11.700]  You have heard the evidence, the decision of the council will now be heard.
[3:45:11.700 --> 3:45:28.460]  Thanks for watching this video.
[3:45:28.460 --> 3:45:57.780]  After 1989, President Bush said, and it's a phrase that I often use myself that we needed
[3:45:57.780 --> 3:46:24.780]  a new world order, a new world order, a new world, a new world, a new world order.
[3:46:24.780 --> 3:46:32.860]  A new world is emerging, it is a new world order with significantly different and radically
[3:46:32.860 --> 3:46:59.860]  new challenges for the future, a new world order, a new world order, a new world order.
[3:46:59.860 --> 3:47:21.860]  The way we're going to win over the long term is not just militarily, we've got to give
[3:47:21.860 --> 3:47:50.860]  them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like.
[3:47:50.860 --> 3:48:17.860]  In the next four years, we will see the emergence of a new international order.
[3:48:17.860 --> 3:48:43.860]  World government is the structure necessary for global justice.
[3:48:43.860 --> 3:49:02.860]  It is a big idea, a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common
[3:49:02.860 --> 3:49:31.860]  with each other, a new world order, a new world order.
[3:49:31.860 --> 3:49:57.860]  All right, and you can see a little bit more of that online.
[3:49:57.860 --> 3:50:07.860]  Yeah, that's Dick Cheney laughing at everybody saying that he wouldn't tell his constituents
[3:50:07.860 --> 3:50:08.860]  to see if our existed.
[3:50:08.860 --> 3:50:11.860]  Of course, Limbaugh, his body lies to him and says it doesn't.
[3:50:11.860 --> 3:50:15.860]  Well, come back, take a few final phone calls, and I guess that didn't get to all the news.
[3:50:15.860 --> 3:50:17.860]  I don't think I'm doing a fifth hour.
[3:50:17.860 --> 3:50:19.860]  Wait a minute, maybe I should.
[3:50:19.860 --> 3:50:21.860]  But wait, I have films to make.
[3:50:21.860 --> 3:50:23.860]  I have too much work to do.
[3:50:23.860 --> 3:50:29.860]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment, we're going to talk to Mike.
[3:50:29.860 --> 3:50:37.860]  We're going to talk to Hailey and Evian.
[3:50:37.860 --> 3:50:39.860]  What a pretty name, Evian.
[3:50:39.860 --> 3:50:44.860]  We'll be right back.
[3:50:44.860 --> 3:50:48.860]  Hi, this is Alex Jones, and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[3:50:48.860 --> 3:50:53.860]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor, even though we're paying record prices at the pump.
[3:50:53.860 --> 3:50:58.860]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage.
[3:50:58.860 --> 3:51:02.860]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system,
[3:51:02.860 --> 3:51:07.860]  protect a complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition,
[3:51:07.860 --> 3:51:09.860]  improving mileage in only one tank full.
[3:51:09.860 --> 3:51:14.860]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your engine.
[3:51:14.860 --> 3:51:18.860]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline, it's time to take action.
[3:51:18.860 --> 3:51:23.860]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment,
[3:51:23.860 --> 3:51:26.860]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[3:51:26.860 --> 3:51:28.860]  Call triple eight, use SFR1.
[3:51:28.860 --> 3:51:35.860]  That number again is triple eight, use SFR1, or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[3:51:35.860 --> 3:51:37.860]  That's oilcompanysecret.com.
[3:51:37.860 --> 3:51:42.860]  Satisfaction is guaranteed, or your money back, and it's safe for all cars.
[3:51:42.860 --> 3:51:44.860]  Act now.
[3:51:44.860 --> 3:51:47.860]  It is a big idea.
[3:51:47.860 --> 3:51:49.860]  A new world order.
[3:51:49.860 --> 3:51:54.860]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:51:54.860 --> 3:51:56.860]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[3:51:56.860 --> 3:51:59.860]  Does their objective be world domination?
[3:51:59.860 --> 3:52:02.860]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:52:02.860 --> 3:52:05.860]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:52:05.860 --> 3:52:10.860]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:52:10.860 --> 3:52:18.860]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:52:18.860 --> 3:52:22.860]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:52:22.860 --> 3:52:25.860]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:52:25.860 --> 3:52:26.860]  Most people have no idea.
[3:52:26.860 --> 3:52:27.860]  They're not after money.
[3:52:27.860 --> 3:52:28.860]  They have all the money they need.
[3:52:28.860 --> 3:52:29.860]  They're after power.
[3:52:29.860 --> 3:52:30.860]  That's their after easy.

[3:52:39.860 --> 3:52:41.860]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved.
[3:52:41.860 --> 3:52:43.860]  You have been warned.
[3:52:43.860 --> 3:52:44.860]  Hey, Emily.
[3:52:44.860 --> 3:52:45.860]  Wow, you look great.
[3:52:45.860 --> 3:52:46.860]  I feel great.
[3:52:46.860 --> 3:52:48.860]  I've been using Medi-Clin's colon cleanse.
[3:52:48.860 --> 3:52:49.860]  Really?
[3:52:49.860 --> 3:52:50.860]  What is it?
[3:52:50.860 --> 3:52:51.860]  How does it work?
[3:52:51.860 --> 3:52:54.860]  Medi-Clin's is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed,
[3:52:54.860 --> 3:52:57.860]  psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[3:52:57.860 --> 3:53:00.860]  Medi-Clin's is easy to use without being intrusive.
[3:53:00.860 --> 3:53:02.860]  You take two tablespoons of Medi-Clin's powder,
[3:53:02.860 --> 3:53:05.860]  mixed with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[3:53:05.860 --> 3:53:06.860]  That's it?
[3:53:06.860 --> 3:53:08.860]  What sounds so easy and convenient?
[3:53:08.860 --> 3:53:09.860]  It is easy.
[3:53:09.860 --> 3:53:12.860]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer
[3:53:12.860 --> 3:53:16.860]  and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[3:53:16.860 --> 3:53:18.860]  It helps with all of those elements?
[3:53:18.860 --> 3:53:19.860]  That's amazing.
[3:53:19.860 --> 3:53:25.860]  And the bentonite clay in Medi-Clin's eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[3:53:25.860 --> 3:53:27.860]  Wow, where can I buy Medi-Clin's?
[3:53:27.860 --> 3:53:30.860]  A one-month supply is available online at Medi-Clin's.com.
[3:53:30.860 --> 3:53:33.860]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E.com.
[3:53:33.860 --> 3:53:40.860]  For more information on Medi-Clin's, visit Medi-Clin's.com.
[3:53:40.860 --> 3:54:06.860]  We'll be right back.
[3:54:12.860 --> 3:54:14.860]  You know, we're going to fix things with an inside job,
[3:54:14.860 --> 3:54:18.860]  changing ourselves first, having the courage to stand up,
[3:54:18.860 --> 3:54:22.860]  the courage to fight back, the courage to get involved.
[3:54:22.860 --> 3:54:26.860]  Just like it always is.
[3:54:26.860 --> 3:54:33.860]  Chalk it up to business as usual.
[3:54:33.860 --> 3:54:45.860]  I know it's hard to live out in the life.
[3:55:06.860 --> 3:55:07.860]  All right.
[3:55:07.860 --> 3:55:11.860]  Final segment of the main Genesis transmission back to Marab.
[3:55:11.860 --> 3:55:16.860]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[3:55:16.860 --> 3:55:18.860]  And then, of course, we do overdrive some days,
[3:55:18.860 --> 3:55:20.860]  and it already screams as soon as the show's over.
[3:55:20.860 --> 3:55:23.860]  If you're missing a David J. Smith or other topics I covered,
[3:55:23.860 --> 3:55:25.860]  we're going to overdrive about 20 minutes today
[3:55:25.860 --> 3:55:28.860]  to take everybody's calls and hit some news I wanted to get to.
[3:55:28.860 --> 3:55:31.860]  But before we do that, here at the end of the main show,
[3:55:31.860 --> 3:55:34.860]  I'm showing my new film, 9-Eleven Truth Rising.
[3:55:34.860 --> 3:55:37.860]  I mean, it's just amazing documentary.
[3:55:37.860 --> 3:55:38.860]  It's cinema verite.
[3:55:38.860 --> 3:55:39.860]  There's no voiceover.
[3:55:39.860 --> 3:55:41.860]  It's very well done, very professional.
[3:55:41.860 --> 3:55:44.860]  Two showings, and then I'm going to take your feedback
[3:55:44.860 --> 3:55:46.860]  and then make a few tweaks and release the film
[3:55:46.860 --> 3:55:47.860]  in about a month and a half.
[3:55:47.860 --> 3:55:49.860]  It'll first be on prisonplanet.tv
[3:55:49.860 --> 3:55:52.860]  for prisonplanet.tv viewers and the DVDs will ship out to everybody.
[3:55:52.860 --> 3:55:54.860]  It really is an amazing film.
[3:55:54.860 --> 3:55:56.860]  Two years in the making, and it's kind of a sleeper
[3:55:56.860 --> 3:55:58.860]  because I'm so busy working.
[3:55:58.860 --> 3:56:01.860]  I haven't had time to hype it up, but it really is
[3:56:01.860 --> 3:56:04.860]  the best-looking, most entertaining film I've ever made,
[3:56:04.860 --> 3:56:06.860]  and it's also very informative.
[3:56:06.860 --> 3:56:08.860]  So I hope you'll be there this Saturday.
[3:56:08.860 --> 3:56:10.860]  Go to infowars.com, link through to buy your tickets
[3:56:10.860 --> 3:56:13.860]  at infowars.com to the Saturday, 3.30 p.m.
[3:56:13.860 --> 3:56:16.860]  downtown Austin at the Alamo Draft House Ritz.
[3:56:16.860 --> 3:56:18.860]  And then Sunday night after my radio show,
[3:56:18.860 --> 3:56:21.860]  6.30 to like 9 at night,
[3:56:21.860 --> 3:56:24.860]  I'll be giving us 30-minute speech at the beginning as well.
[3:56:24.860 --> 3:56:25.860]  So get your tickets.
[3:56:25.860 --> 3:56:27.860]  More than half have sold for the first showing.
[3:56:27.860 --> 3:56:29.860]  Half have sold for the second showing.
[3:56:29.860 --> 3:56:32.860]  So there aren't a lot of tickets left.
[3:56:32.860 --> 3:56:35.860]  They always hold about 10% of the tickets, though, to at the door.
[3:56:35.860 --> 3:56:37.860]  So you can go to the door now and buy them
[3:56:37.860 --> 3:56:40.860]  or buy them the day of at the door, but it's limited.
[3:56:40.860 --> 3:56:41.860]  So I hope to see you there.
[3:56:41.860 --> 3:56:43.860]  Also, I meant to talk about this during the main show.
[3:56:43.860 --> 3:56:44.860]  I didn't.
[3:56:44.860 --> 3:56:48.860]  It's the InfoWars Money Bomb, the website's infowarsmoneybomb.com,
[3:56:48.860 --> 3:56:51.860]  infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[3:56:51.860 --> 3:56:53.860]  This is the guy that originally came up with the idea
[3:56:53.860 --> 3:56:57.860]  of the May 31st, 08 Money Bomb.
[3:56:57.860 --> 3:57:00.860]  And then it got picked up by Trevor Lyman and others.
[3:57:00.860 --> 3:57:02.860]  And I'm going to get this guy on.
[3:57:02.860 --> 3:57:07.860]  But I have been so busy that this has been out for like a week
[3:57:07.860 --> 3:57:08.860]  and I haven't even mentioned it.
[3:57:08.860 --> 3:57:10.860]  Now, I thought about not even mentioning it,
[3:57:10.860 --> 3:57:12.860]  because frankly, I don't really ask for donations
[3:57:12.860 --> 3:57:14.860]  and I'm not trying to get donations,
[3:57:14.860 --> 3:57:16.860]  but it just so happens that I want to gear up,
[3:57:16.860 --> 3:57:22.860]  build a stage, build a system to do a national TV show
[3:57:22.860 --> 3:57:25.860]  at least once a week on cable, on Dish Network,
[3:57:25.860 --> 3:57:26.860]  or one of those.
[3:57:26.860 --> 3:57:28.860]  It's very easy to do.
[3:57:28.860 --> 3:57:30.860]  Well, it's hard to do, but easier than you think is the way
[3:57:30.860 --> 3:57:31.860]  to put it.
[3:57:31.860 --> 3:57:32.860]  It just takes capital.
[3:57:32.860 --> 3:57:33.860]  Well, we want to do that.
[3:57:33.860 --> 3:57:36.860]  We want to go into a bigger office, do a lot of new things.
[3:57:36.860 --> 3:57:37.860]  But it takes money.
[3:57:37.860 --> 3:57:39.860]  And this is perfect.
[3:57:39.860 --> 3:57:41.860]  The InfoWars Money Bomb, from May 31st,
[3:57:41.860 --> 3:57:45.860]  go pledge on the site and they want to get 20,000 people
[3:57:45.860 --> 3:57:47.860]  to give $100 on that day.
[3:57:47.860 --> 3:57:49.860]  And we did this for Ron Paul and everybody else.
[3:57:49.860 --> 3:57:51.860]  And I can't think of a better place to give.
[3:57:51.860 --> 3:57:56.860]  So also, if I don't plug this and then it's a bomb in a bad way,
[3:57:56.860 --> 3:57:58.860]  then it'll be like, oh, look, they only raised $10,000.
[3:57:58.860 --> 3:58:02.860]  We can raise people hundreds of thou all the time.
[3:58:02.860 --> 3:58:04.860]  Ron Paul admits we raised millions of us millions.
[3:58:04.860 --> 3:58:07.860]  So I would hope you'd raise money and we will put it all
[3:58:07.860 --> 3:58:10.860]  into all of it, into buying cameras, better equipment,
[3:58:10.860 --> 3:58:13.860]  better studio, and paying for airtime on TV.
[3:58:13.860 --> 3:58:17.860]  So, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com will be right back in overdrive
[3:58:17.860 --> 3:58:18.860]  at InfoWars.com.

[3:58:56.860 --> 3:58:59.860]  of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[3:59:07.860 --> 3:59:10.860]  is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
