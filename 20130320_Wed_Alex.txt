[00:00.000 --> 00:11.720]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:11.720 --> 00:38.480]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.480 --> 00:45.740]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of March, 2013. And things are imploding by design in the
[00:45.740 --> 00:51.040]  euro right now, militarily. There is all sorts of escalation and hack attacks shutting down
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.140]  many government and private networks in South Korea. They're claiming the North, who can't
[00:56.140 --> 01:01.000]  even manufacture an automobile, have supposedly launched these attacks.
[01:01.000 --> 01:04.960]  These are real attacks. It's the Chinese that use North Korea as a sock puppet. We're gonna
[01:04.960 --> 01:08.180]  be going over all that. Here's some of the incredible headlines we're gonna be breaking
[01:08.180 --> 01:15.120]  down. Is Spain preparing for its own deposit levy? And then Zero Hedge breaks down some
[01:15.120 --> 01:19.080]  of the Spanish newspapers, saying they are.
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.560]  And you have the German, head of the German Central Bank, calling for a 15% levy. Of course,
[01:24.560 --> 01:31.160]  in Italy, that's on record. And so this is moving across Europe right now. Cypriot business
[01:31.160 --> 01:36.040]  owner, the Germans want to destroy us like they bombed London in World War II. They're
[01:36.040 --> 01:39.480]  using economic weapons, but Germany's getting the blame.
[01:39.480 --> 01:45.220]  The German people are paying the bill for the mega-bankers to come in and basically
[01:45.220 --> 01:50.380]  finance the takeover of the other countries. It's the same thing. So the Germans are getting
[01:50.380 --> 01:56.120]  blamed again. And of course, Germany is the center of the spoke of Europe financing it,
[01:56.120 --> 02:00.440]  because the Germans work so incredibly hard and invent so many things. It is the engine
[02:00.440 --> 02:03.740]  of Europe, but they've been financing their own destruction.
[02:03.740 --> 02:08.440]  The Germans don't like this. They want out of the euro. But see, they use divide and
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.400]  conquer all over Europe. The Germans, they're the ones, not Goldman Sachs, not JP Morgan,
[02:13.400 --> 02:18.640]  not Bank of England. And we don't blame the British people either. It's these institutions.
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.040]  It's incredible. We're gonna be going over all that. Cyprus crisis deepens. Bailout rejected.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.040]  Banks may not reopen.
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.800]  The German Central Bank that runs the euro, and I've got the quotes here, is saying, okay,
[02:30.800 --> 02:36.640]  how about none of your money then? If you don't agree to 10% off the top and money whenever
[02:36.640 --> 02:42.040]  we want on top of all your taxes, then we just will not open the banks again. I mean,
[02:42.040 --> 02:46.820]  this is crazy land, but it's where we knew it would go, and they'll probably capitulate.
[02:46.820 --> 02:50.480]  And then a few years from now, there'll be more bailouts. That's how this works. Iceland
[02:50.480 --> 02:57.680]  said no, well, three years ago now, and they have the fastest growing economy compared
[02:57.680 --> 03:02.920]  to England, all of the UK, the rest of the Atlantic island nations, and the United States
[03:02.920 --> 03:03.920]  and Canada.
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.960]  Those numbers came out two days ago, because they said no, and it turned out almost all
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.400]  the debt was not theirs. They paid off the 7% or so debt that was really theirs, the
[03:12.400 --> 03:16.720]  90 plus percent. They said, hey, we're gonna arrest our banking ministers that signed us
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.280]  on to this with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England, and others. At first, the
[03:21.280 --> 03:23.080]  British government called them terrorists.
[03:23.080 --> 03:27.800]  You can pull that up, and said no Icelander can use British airwaves or come to England,
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.120]  400,000 people. They said fine, crooks, we won't come to your stinking country. They
[03:32.120 --> 03:39.360]  had to back off. Call their bluff. Now here is a member of the UK, EU Parliament, Nigel
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.680]  Farage, who were working to get on the show last night saying get your money out. They're
[03:43.680 --> 03:48.200]  going to implode everything. We're gonna go out to break with a clip of this.
[03:48.200 --> 03:52.200]  Well it can't afford Cyprus to fail, it can't afford Greece to fail, Portugal, Spain, or
[03:52.200 --> 03:56.960]  Ireland. They know that once one country goes, the whole deck of cards will come tumbling
[03:56.960 --> 04:03.360]  down and countries like Germany will realise absolutely vast losses, possibly as much as
[04:03.360 --> 04:09.800]  1 trillion euros. So they are prepared now to do anything, literally anything, to try
[04:09.800 --> 04:14.480]  to keep the euro afloat, and that is why they've now resorted, as I say, to what can only be
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.900]  described as theft. And now they've done it in one country, they're quite capable of doing
[04:20.900 --> 04:26.240]  it in Italy, Spain, Portugal or anywhere else. And the message that sends to people who've
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.960]  got savings in banks in those countries, certainly if I was them, is get your money out while
[04:31.960 --> 04:32.960]  you can.
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.240]  All right, we're going to come back and play that entire five minute interview he did on
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.680]  our team. It's so important, again we're going to get him back on the show, he's been on
[04:41.680 --> 04:46.960]  many times. He survived a plane crash recently that almost killed the pilot who's basically
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.880]  disabled heavily now. And guess who else survived a plane crash? It was very suspicious at night
[04:50.880 --> 04:57.240]  view. The day before he came on the show and didn't tell us, Joel Skousen. We'll be right
[04:57.240 --> 05:00.040]  back. Stay with us.
[05:00.040 --> 05:04.880]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had
[05:04.880 --> 05:08.880]  a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well
[05:08.880 --> 05:13.440]  known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[05:13.440 --> 05:18.840]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key
[05:18.840 --> 05:24.300]  minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer
[05:24.300 --> 05:29.680]  and be healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.160]  discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real
[05:34.160 --> 05:39.400]  nutrition you need. And once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[07:00.440 --> 07:05.480]  with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic
[07:05.480 --> 07:11.360]  system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

[07:59.000 --> 08:28.960]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.960 --> 08:33.920]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We're live. We're kicking off the
[08:33.920 --> 08:41.300]  transmission right now on this Wednesday, 20th day of March 2013. We've got Rosa Corey
[08:41.300 --> 08:47.860]  of Behind the Green Mask, really the firebrand out there eloquently with precision fighting
[08:47.860 --> 08:53.960]  Agenda 21 in the trenches at point blank range. She's here on a speaking tour across Texas.
[08:53.960 --> 09:02.560]  She is scheduled, as they say, to be in studio with us coming up in the second hour today.
[09:02.560 --> 09:09.580]  Okay, where to start? Obviously, we're going into a contrived global financial crisis,
[09:09.580 --> 09:15.180]  which the mega banks believe they're going to use to hold the planetary system hostage
[09:15.180 --> 09:24.340]  under economic espionage and economic fraud, economic hijacking to accept a new global
[09:24.340 --> 09:31.320]  digital SDR currency pegged with some gold and some petrol dollars backing it. And that's
[09:31.320 --> 09:34.920]  officially at Davos for a decade. They've been moving towards that. That's what comes
[09:34.920 --> 09:35.920]  out of Bilderberg.
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.160]  That's the plan. So we've been saying look for them to start regional wars, destabilization
[09:41.160 --> 09:48.220]  operations in the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, other Mediterranean
[09:48.220 --> 09:59.780]  areas far east into Southeast Asia, the North Pacific area, basically worldwide chaos. If
[09:59.780 --> 10:04.040]  you had to describe the new world order, it'd be I guess the bad guys from Get Smart because
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.940]  they are chaos agents.
[10:05.940 --> 10:11.240]  And then they always have the actuary breakdowns and the groups, the IMF, the World Bank, the
[10:11.240 --> 10:17.160]  Ex-Im Bank, the International Bank of Settlements, the OECD. Look up these groups, folks. There
[10:17.160 --> 10:23.440]  to then respond to the crisis with what? More Western taxpayer money, more get out of jail
[10:23.440 --> 10:28.960]  free cards, more diplomatic immunity, more world government, where they create a wall
[10:28.960 --> 10:35.080]  of red tape to control you and shut you and your country down while they exempt themselves.
[10:35.080 --> 10:40.480]  So it is 21st century warfare based on the old British great game that itself is the
[10:40.480 --> 10:48.400]  old Roman great game of divide and conquer. How did the Romans that were maybe 7, 8% of
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.200]  the known world population that they were dominating at any one time, how were they
[10:53.200 --> 11:04.640]  able to control everybody? Divide and conquer, balkanization. Divide and conquer, balkanization.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.800]  That's why you see that at every level of society. They want you to think inherently
[11:08.800 --> 11:15.120]  about fighting with yourselves and having no unity unless it's in your little racial
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.160]  group or religious group that they control or manipulate instead of having an identity
[11:19.160 --> 11:24.640]  and liberty and freedom and justice and creativity and renaissance and enlightenment.
[11:24.640 --> 11:30.120]  They don't want that, the true illumination. You see, they call themselves the Illuminati,
[11:30.120 --> 11:35.320]  but they're illuminated, they believe. They want you in darkness. See, they're a counterfeit.
[11:35.320 --> 11:41.960]  So I use words like illuminate or I use a term like billions of points of light are
[11:41.960 --> 11:47.880]  sentient minds following God's plan, bringing light and salt to the world. And the Bible
[11:47.880 --> 11:51.360]  says that bring light, salt to the world. But see, the devil says he's gonna bring light
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.640]  to the earth as well, but he's not bringing illumination. That's why their symbol is the
[11:55.640 --> 12:01.320]  owl because it sees in the night and you don't. And they bring darkness so that you can't
[12:01.320 --> 12:03.520]  see and they can see.
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.780]  And once you figure out their game plan and their handbook, their playbook, it is laughably
[12:08.780 --> 12:17.200]  obvious and simple. Because they arrange it, it's stacked on itself. Their management systems
[12:17.200 --> 12:23.120]  are stacked, but it's the same management system at each level, at each ring, concentric
[12:23.120 --> 12:31.520]  rings that centralize down to fewer and fewer people as you go towards the paramount top,
[12:31.520 --> 12:35.160]  as you go towards the apex, the peak.
[12:35.160 --> 12:41.280]  But it's the same management system. So if you know one level, you know the next level.
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.680]  And incredible things are happening worldwide right now. I wanna play you a clip from RT
[12:47.680 --> 12:55.200]  last night. It's up at infoawards.com via Zero Hedge. I wanna play you a clip of Nigel
[12:55.200 --> 13:02.760]  Farage, who survived a very mysterious plane crash during his last campaign for EU Parliament.
[13:02.760 --> 13:06.080]  Because he's a real leader. They're gonna end up replacing the Conservative Party, just
[13:06.080 --> 13:08.960]  like the real Tea Party could replace the Republicans here.
[13:08.960 --> 13:13.200]  David Cameron's panicking, the liberals are panicking, the fake conservatives are panicking.
[13:13.200 --> 13:17.920]  He barely survived a plane crash. Joel Skalzen had a very, I think, mysterious plane crash.
[13:17.920 --> 13:22.080]  The plane never, I watched the newscast, has never been known to have that problem. Coming
[13:22.080 --> 13:26.940]  in on landing, the engine totally failed. It flipped end over end, and he got out basically
[13:26.940 --> 13:27.940]  unscathed.
[13:27.940 --> 13:32.880]  They're calling it a miracle. That happened the day before he was on with us last week,
[13:32.880 --> 13:38.960]  and he didn't even tell. I wonder why he had a little cut on his head and his nose. But
[13:38.960 --> 13:42.000]  then later, people were sending me emails, stuff saying, you didn't know he was in a
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.560]  plane crash? He's on with us next. Thank God he's okay. He's on with us next Monday, World
[13:48.560 --> 13:56.560]  Affairs brief, former Navy, Marine Corps, Vietnam War pilot, carrier pilot.
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.320]  And of course, I mean, this just keeps happening to patriots, folks. It's very suspicious.
[14:01.320 --> 14:08.000]  I mean, how many Congress people's planes blow up or disappear? Or Larry McDonald, the
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.760]  list goes on and on. Very, very suspicious. I mean, if something like that happens to
[14:12.760 --> 14:15.520]  me, and I'm not a pilot, but if something like that happens to me and is suspicious,
[14:15.520 --> 14:18.040]  I want it investigated.
[14:18.040 --> 14:22.040]  Because there's a lot of that going on, a lot of that happening. And I laugh because
[14:22.040 --> 14:27.820]  it's uncomfortable. But I'm gonna go over hack attacks happening all over the world
[14:27.820 --> 14:33.080]  right now that are being blamed on North Korea. North Korea cannot tie its shoelaces. They
[14:33.080 --> 14:41.240]  drive around in 57 Chevys, the government does. It's a crumbling joke of parasitic intrigue.
[14:41.240 --> 14:45.840]  But they're saying the South got this massive financial and government hack attack. JP Morgan
[14:45.840 --> 14:52.560]  saying it's not a hack that all their computers said zero in balances. I've talked to IT people,
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.680]  that's not how those systems work.
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.000]  I've talked to people in banking, that's not how they work. It's very suspicious. I'm gonna
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.120]  get into what that really signifies from different perspectives. We're gonna look at they're
[15:03.120 --> 15:08.680]  now talking about taking money not just out of Greece, and not just out of Cyprus, Cyprus,
[15:08.680 --> 15:15.400]  the Cypriot people, and not just Italy, but now Spain. This is really spreading.
[15:15.400 --> 15:20.120]  And again, people say, well, it will destroy confidence. It will destroy confidence. Why
[15:20.120 --> 15:25.880]  would they do this? Because it'll be the same mega banks that implode their front banks.
[15:25.880 --> 15:32.200]  They can change the name of Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan, or they can change the name
[15:32.200 --> 15:37.640]  just like they've done of the brokerage houses and banks, Lehman Brothers and stuff they
[15:37.640 --> 15:40.000]  imploded in 2008.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.840]  It's the private shareholders, the banks are front holding companies. The central banks
[15:44.840 --> 15:49.800]  are holding company fronts for the holding companies. Again, fronts in front of fronts,
[15:49.800 --> 15:54.440]  in front of fronts, in front of fronts. It's come out the Rothschilds every time they arrest,
[15:54.440 --> 16:00.400]  almost every time they arrest some Russian oligarch in Russia, who's got 6, 7, 10, 15
[16:00.400 --> 16:01.400]  million.
[16:01.400 --> 16:07.640]  They have yachts the size of World War II battleships, no joke. Pull up Russian oligarchs
[16:07.640 --> 16:12.140]  yacht docks in New York a few months ago. It's like a battleship, it's a cruise ship.
[16:12.140 --> 16:17.540]  And the point is, is that every time they arrest one of them, or try to seize their
[16:17.540 --> 16:23.960]  bank accounts, it turns out it's a Rothschild front. So the Rothschild sued newspapers a
[16:23.960 --> 16:28.720]  few years ago saying, stop saying we're puppet masters, and then the judge found it was actually
[16:28.720 --> 16:29.720]  true.
[16:29.720 --> 16:34.640]  Yeah, there it is. Now that's a boat, world's largest yacht belonging to a Russian millionaire.
[16:34.640 --> 16:38.440]  I'm not even saying he's a corrupt guy, I don't know all his details, docks in New York.
[16:38.440 --> 16:42.400]  But the point is, that's what's going on with the Russian people's money. See, they never
[16:42.400 --> 16:47.320]  really got privatization in Russia. They took the Duma controlled Communist Party system
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.560]  controlled by a few hundred guys, and they all left the Duma and put their puppets in
[16:52.560 --> 16:59.240]  like Putin, and went, and they're totally drugged out of his mind, Yeltsin who couldn't
[16:59.240 --> 17:00.240]  even talk.
[17:00.240 --> 17:04.920]  They put him up there, while they all then went and took over the nickel, the iron, the
[17:04.920 --> 17:11.440]  steel production, the oil, the natural gas. It's all just big mafia combines, and it's
[17:11.440 --> 17:18.440]  truly, truly, truly disgusting. But the point is, even these guys are Dutch royal, British
[17:18.440 --> 17:23.340]  royal Rothschild fronts. But let's go ahead and go to this Nigel Farage clip, where he's
[17:23.340 --> 17:26.560]  breaking down what's really happening in Europe. Here it is.
[17:26.560 --> 17:31.080]  Well, it can't afford Cyprus to fail, it can't afford Greece to fail, Portugal, Spain, or
[17:31.080 --> 17:35.920]  Ireland. They know that once one country goes, the whole deck of cards will come tumbling
[17:35.920 --> 17:41.960]  down, and countries like Germany will realize absolutely vast losses, possibly as much as
[17:41.960 --> 17:48.700]  one trillion euros. So they are prepared now to do anything, literally anything, to try
[17:48.700 --> 17:53.360]  to keep the euro afloat, and that is why they've now resorted, as I say, to what can only be
[17:53.360 --> 17:59.780]  described as theft. And now they've done it in one country, they're quite capable of doing
[17:59.780 --> 18:04.940]  it in Italy, Spain, Portugal, or anywhere else. And the message that sends to people
[18:04.940 --> 18:10.020]  who've got savings in banks in those countries, certainly if I was them, is get your money
[18:10.020 --> 18:14.080]  out while you can. But I guess there's also duty to look after
[18:14.080 --> 18:17.880]  the many expats that are there. In 2010, almost twice as much British money went to Cyprus
[18:17.880 --> 18:22.560]  as transfers from Russia recorded the country's official website. Surely you've got a responsibility
[18:22.560 --> 18:25.880]  to safeguard your constituents' interests there now?
[18:25.880 --> 18:32.760]  Well, I mean, you know, what the British government have said is that they will stand surety for
[18:32.760 --> 18:35.760]  the British army soldiers and air force people. But what about all the expats who have been
[18:35.760 --> 18:41.600]  living there for 20, 30 years? The government have had nothing to say on
[18:41.600 --> 18:48.200]  that subject whatsoever. And what the government ought to do is to help the British people
[18:48.200 --> 18:52.240]  living down there, mostly pensioners, but what the British government needs to do is
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.600]  to say to the hundreds of thousands of Brits that are living in southern Spain, for goodness
[18:56.600 --> 19:01.660]  sake, get your money out of that country and have a monthly transfer to pay your bills.
[19:01.660 --> 19:06.320]  And that is what I'd like to see the Chancellor George Osborne do in his budget statement
[19:06.320 --> 19:08.120]  tomorrow in the House of Commons. All right.
[19:08.120 --> 19:10.280]  What sort of message is this? Okay, so we're going to try to get him on
[19:10.280 --> 19:13.680]  in the next few days. He's a very busy man, but he does come on when we request it. He's
[19:13.680 --> 19:19.720]  really the Rand Paul, Ron Paul of Europe now. And again, he's elected to the EU Parliament,
[19:19.720 --> 19:27.120]  but he'll point out that the EU bureaucracy that exempts itself from EU taxes makes all
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.040]  the rules. They just pass things and then it's a recommendation and it's all ignored
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.880]  by a bureaucracy who's all Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of England execs.
[19:37.880 --> 19:43.280]  I mean, they appoint presidents and prime ministers now over these countries. Europe
[19:43.280 --> 19:47.480]  has been financially conquered, but it's a fraud. Admit you've been conquered and admit
[19:47.480 --> 19:52.160]  that they're holding you hostage. Things aren't going to get better. Most of the Cyprus debt
[19:52.160 --> 19:56.600]  is not their debt. It is globalist debt they've been signed on to. But the media won't talk
[19:56.600 --> 20:02.600]  about that. It's another giant hoax. Stay with us March into big spring preparedness

[22:41.840 --> 22:45.120]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[22:45.120 --> 22:49.840]  army? Hi, Ted Anderson. I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[23:04.560 --> 23:10.020]  Hi, this is Pastor Jenny. And as a woman of faith, I spent many years in ministry burdened
[23:10.020 --> 23:17.280]  with anxiety and fear. But in 2010, I met Dr. Carolyn Dean, and I took her recommendation
[23:17.280 --> 23:24.560]  to try RNA drops. Within days of taking RNA drops, my anxiety began to lift. My joy was
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.560]  restored and the peace of mind that I would have once called a miracle has now become
[23:29.560 --> 23:35.880]  normal to me. Discover what RNA drops can do for you. Order your free sample today at

[23:56.560 --> 24:07.360]  Maybe there's a miracle waiting there for you.
[24:07.360 --> 24:12.440]  In the next segment I'm going to look at the entire geopolitical field and the hack attacks,
[24:12.440 --> 24:17.800]  the military things that are happening, the use of Al-Qaeda against Muslim countries by
[24:17.800 --> 24:24.240]  the West and just how over the top all this is and what I believe it's leading to. But
[24:24.240 --> 24:30.120]  I want to continue with what's happening with bank runs here and around the world, seeing
[24:30.120 --> 24:34.380]  some of the glitches and problems that are being rolled out.
[24:34.380 --> 24:42.140]  But let's go up to infowars.com first. If you go to the featured news areas, Chinese
[24:42.140 --> 24:49.220]  eugenicist factory collects genius DNA to breed enhanced people. Chinese may launch
[24:49.220 --> 24:53.320]  eugenics operations for economic reasons, offering it to the world. That's why they
[24:53.320 --> 24:58.760]  take your blood for now 41 years at birth in all Western countries to put it in a UN
[24:58.760 --> 24:59.760]  database.
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.320]  I of course broke that 16 years ago. It was declassified about five years ago. They secretly
[25:04.320 --> 25:07.760]  take your blood. Of course they do. They spy on you. They do whatever they want. They put
[25:07.760 --> 25:13.760]  cancer viruses in the vaccines. You're not in Kansas anymore, folks. Syrian rebels caught
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.320]  on tape discussing chemical weapons attack.
[25:17.320 --> 25:21.880]  Well, yeah, last year we had video of them talking about that. Now there's new ones.
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.760]  It doesn't matter. They'll just blame it on Assad and say he's al-Qaeda while they use
[25:25.760 --> 25:30.120]  al-Qaeda and publicly harm him. It's just the American people say good, kill everybody,
[25:30.120 --> 25:31.760]  nerve gas them.
[25:31.760 --> 25:36.940]  Feinstein vows not to play dead on anti-second amendment bill. Look, she brings out her ultra
[25:36.940 --> 25:41.620]  radical bill. So now the bill that's gone through has banning of private sales and basically
[25:41.620 --> 25:47.560]  national registration and letting the police say everybody's mentally ill and throw you
[25:47.560 --> 25:51.720]  in a mental institution, which all authoritarian systems have done.
[25:51.720 --> 25:55.640]  And we just saw a case in Williamson County that was in the paper. They're always setting
[25:55.640 --> 26:01.040]  up innocent people. They're famous for that. And throwing lawyers who are totally well
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.640]  spoken, have no criminal record, who sue them. They just come and arrest you and throw you
[26:05.640 --> 26:09.680]  in a mental institution for three years and drug you up.
[26:09.680 --> 26:14.560]  And then finally, the person's a lawyer. So as other lawyers sue and get you out and you
[26:14.560 --> 26:18.320]  hear the person interviewed, they're totally cogent. I mean, that's the problem is that
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.320]  they're charging people for hay dust and giving them five years in prison. They're charging
[26:24.320 --> 26:29.440]  people and giving them five years in prison if in your own creek, cows go down and drink
[26:29.440 --> 26:33.200]  and some mud gets into the creek, something animals have always done.
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.960]  Look at Africa, they're running free and open. The animals go down and the water buffalo
[26:37.960 --> 26:43.040]  go down, the same thing as a cow, same species, just wild. You're arrested. You let a couple
[26:43.040 --> 26:48.200]  balloons go for your girlfriend as a present. State police pull over, buy your house, you
[26:48.200 --> 26:52.320]  just let those balloons go? Yeah, for my girlfriend. All right, you're facing multiple counts,
[26:52.320 --> 26:54.640]  five years in jail per balloon.
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.560]  It's a felony and he'll have his guns taken and the jury will convict. And then they will
[26:59.560 --> 27:04.320]  pay to keep him in jail for three or four years of the sentence building things for
[27:04.320 --> 27:08.760]  25 cents an hour and then they'll wonder why they don't have a job. They won't figure it
[27:08.760 --> 27:16.060]  out because they wanna get hurt. They wanna get hurt bad. It's a religion to be a chump.
[27:16.060 --> 27:19.280]  It's a religion to get run over. It's a religion to be abused.
[27:19.280 --> 27:22.760]  It's a religion to have the largest prison population. It's a religion to have an illegal
[27:22.760 --> 27:28.040]  foreign banking government crushing other countries and crushing us. $85 billion, they're
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.600]  just running up our debt where it's impossible to pay back, giving it to the IMF and World
[27:32.600 --> 27:35.860]  Bank, which are part of the Federal Reserve.
[27:35.860 --> 27:39.760]  Its local name is Federal Reserve. You're a foreign banking takeover arm. You call yourself
[27:39.760 --> 27:45.520]  the Federal Reserve. I'm convinced hijackers could take over aircraft and put on the captain's
[27:45.520 --> 27:52.500]  suit and walk out and say, I am the captain. And they could be, I am Habib Ahmed, I am
[27:52.500 --> 27:54.740]  the captain, even have bombs strapped on them.
[27:54.740 --> 27:58.880]  And most people on board the plane would kneel. And if the captain ran out in his underwear
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.040]  and said, no, he's got my uniform. The people on board would attack the clear American,
[28:05.040 --> 28:09.480]  whether he was black, white, Hispanic, whatever. They would tear him apart and just start bowing,
[28:09.480 --> 28:10.480]  we love you.
[28:10.480 --> 28:14.640]  And then they would probably grab hanger days and pull the pins out. Kill me, you're the
[28:14.640 --> 28:21.400]  government. I mean, it's mass Stockholm syndrome, I'm serious. As long as you just say you're
[28:21.400 --> 28:25.920]  the government and you're actually scary, they fall before you. Now if you're good and
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.200]  wholesome and wanna help them, they attack you like piranhas.
[28:30.200 --> 28:33.800]  If you talk common sense, you're a terrorist. And I have the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[28:33.800 --> 28:37.280]  one of their new reports right here. Look at this if you're a TV viewer. Look at the
[28:37.280 --> 28:42.480]  drawing they did of me, where I look like some kind of evil superhero. You guys document
[28:42.480 --> 28:49.600]  cam on this. I mean, look at that. And they say I'm one of the leading terrorists, ladies
[28:49.600 --> 28:55.880]  and gentlemen. I am a deadly terror. Look how evil I look, that's hilarious. That is
[28:55.880 --> 28:56.880]  hilarious.
[28:56.880 --> 29:06.340]  And there's a new comic book out in the new Avengers, where the red skull is like throwing
[29:06.340 --> 29:14.560]  some fat redneck down and it's me. Yeah, I look like a mean John Lithgow there. I mean,
[29:14.560 --> 29:20.120]  this is the type of stuff and the public loves it. They're like, take everything I got. Shoot
[29:20.120 --> 29:24.920]  my kid up with cancer viruses, it's fine.
[29:24.920 --> 29:29.520]  Give my baby 50 vaccines, lab a convulsion and die, put me in jail. Thank you for killing
[29:29.520 --> 29:35.080]  my baby, throw me in jail. They'll apologize when they go to prison. It's like, you want
[29:35.080 --> 29:40.440]  your bank account taken. You want to die young. You want aspartame in your milk. You want
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.320]  brain damage. You want it. You got it. I'm talking to new listeners who love the government.
[29:44.320 --> 29:48.000]  You're right. They're going to rape you hard. You love it. Just make sure you thank the
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.560]  new world order.

[32:56.920 --> 33:07.480]  your life on e Foods Direct. You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth. A lie. No man is obsolete.
[33:07.480 --> 33:12.440]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth. You're an anachronism like a ghost from another time.
[33:12.440 --> 33:17.520]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[33:17.520 --> 33:23.560]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth. A crawling insect, an ugly misformed little creature who has
[33:23.560 --> 33:31.040]  no purpose here, no meaning. I am a human being. Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no
[33:31.040 --> 33:37.560]  substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind. I don't care. I tell you, I don't
[33:37.560 --> 33:44.240]  care. I'm a human being. I exist. And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives
[33:44.240 --> 33:52.000]  even after I'm shoveled in my grave. Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth. Delusions that you inject
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.240]  into your veins to make you think you have a strength, but you have no strength at all.
[33:57.240 --> 34:05.080]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream. And the state has no use for your kind. Resistance
[34:05.080 --> 34:15.720]  to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones. And resistance to tyrants is the only
[34:15.720 --> 34:22.920]  thing that will produce a good, healthy, happy, incredibly wealthy and prosperous society.
[34:22.920 --> 34:28.600]  And those that win the liberty are always the greatest generation. 1776ers are our real
[34:28.600 --> 34:32.600]  greatest generation. People that went through the Depression were a great generation compared
[34:32.600 --> 34:38.040]  to what we've become because they went through hell and that made them stronger. As Victor
[34:38.040 --> 34:45.200]  Hugo said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters. And it's really true. And
[34:45.200 --> 34:49.960]  then generations become decadent, they become slobs, and then they don't want to hear about
[34:49.960 --> 34:54.800]  tyranny. They don't want to hear about corruption. They want to say that doesn't exist and laugh
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.560]  at those that warn them. And then when you laugh at those that warn you about tyranny,
[34:59.560 --> 35:03.160]  well pretty soon it grows and grows and grows and then you still have to defend the tyranny
[35:03.160 --> 35:04.640]  because you don't want to admit you were wrong.
[35:04.640 --> 35:10.360]  Plus now the tyranny's out in the open and scary. And so you stick your head deeper in
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.700]  the sand. You run further under the black wings of the New World Order and snuggle up
[35:15.700 --> 35:22.360]  to its undercoat, begging it for some more government vomit. But now it's not little
[35:22.360 --> 35:27.660]  chunklets of meat stolen by Mommy Vulture. Now Mommy Vulture's spewing down acid on top
[35:27.660 --> 35:32.820]  of your little gosling head and it's not gonna be very fun.
[35:32.820 --> 35:39.040]  So there I go with some bird analogies for everyone. I am Alex Jones, your host. The

[37:51.120 --> 37:57.640]  again that's how much it costs to sign up there at infowarshealth.com or infowarsteam.com.

[38:09.520 --> 38:12.600]  ship when you sign up for that.
[38:12.600 --> 38:16.480]  Okay, let me give the number out because after I cover some more of these headlines, I want
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.480]  to take a few calls before Rosa Corey gets in here in studio with us and we'll open the
[38:19.480 --> 38:26.580]  phones up for her as well on your agenda 21 horror stories. Recognizing the threat, recognizing
[38:26.580 --> 38:33.280]  the enemy operations is half the battle. Recognize it, identify it, demonize it because that's
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.360]  not hard, you just show what it is, it's demonized. It's the enemy, it's trying to demonize us
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.360]  because they know we're the antidote.
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.560]  So demonize them, hit them as hard as you can, expose all their crimes. The only problem
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.720]  is they're so unbelievable people won't believe it and they will fall. They will fall in any
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.040]  fight, ladies and gentlemen, don't think about who's winning. I can't tell you how many physical
[38:54.040 --> 38:57.480]  fights I got in and I'm not a tough guy, but I grew up in Dallas, got in a lot of fights
[38:57.480 --> 39:01.040]  where some guy be pounded on you and he'd stop after he punched you a few times to see
[39:01.040 --> 39:02.360]  if you were gonna fall over.
[39:02.360 --> 39:07.360]  And that was always my opportunity, even if they were faster and tougher than me, that
[39:07.360 --> 39:14.240]  okay they just let up. Now I'm hurt bad, now I can turn on the good old boy juice and stomp
[39:14.240 --> 39:17.880]  their butt in the ground. That's the same thing, just stop listening to them. They're
[39:17.880 --> 39:20.940]  gonna tell you we're powerless, they're gonna tell you we're losing, they're gonna tell
[39:20.940 --> 39:27.040]  you we're pathetic, they're gonna tell you we're defeated. Just keep swinging, keep swinging
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.620]  ladies and gentlemen and they will fall.
[39:29.620 --> 39:33.840]  Their whole new world order will fall because things are about to get a lot worse. And if
[39:33.840 --> 39:38.320]  you think this radio show has exploded because what we've talked about is coming true, imagine
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.160]  when more and more comes true. Imagine what's gonna happen when you've talked about this
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.160]  stuff to your friends, family and neighbors and it starts all coming true.
[39:47.160 --> 39:51.360]  Now you're gonna be the go to person. I can't tell you how many police officers and how
[39:51.360 --> 39:55.880]  many federal officers have called into this show or that I've run into personally. I mean
[39:55.880 --> 39:59.600]  I've run into them when they're protecting famous people, I'll just leave it at that.
[39:59.600 --> 40:04.200]  Well one time, it's so long ago, I can talk about it, the Bush daughters. Federal Marshals
[40:04.200 --> 40:10.200]  wanting my autograph and stuff and talking to me about the new world order and all the
[40:10.200 --> 40:12.100]  rest of it. I mean it just constantly happens.
[40:12.100 --> 40:15.860]  On average, these are not bad people. They're compartmentalized, they know my show's telling
[40:15.860 --> 40:19.760]  the truth because they're in the belly of the beast. They are seeing all this stuff
[40:19.760 --> 40:25.760]  for themselves. I have found it easier to wake up people in the power structure than
[40:25.760 --> 40:27.540]  the general public.
[40:27.540 --> 40:32.280]  It's easier to wake up military, it's easier to wake up police. It's easier to wake, and
[40:32.280 --> 40:35.420]  I'm not kissing up to those groups either. People know I used to be at a fundamental
[40:35.420 --> 40:41.240]  primitive level attacking all those groups because I saw them as the tentacle of the
[40:41.240 --> 40:46.320]  enemy I was fighting. Until I realized the tentacle has its own brain and doesn't particularly
[40:46.320 --> 40:49.680]  like what it's attached to, you understand that?
[40:49.680 --> 40:54.960]  I've discovered we can turn the tentacles against the system because the tentacles actually
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.520]  came from America, they've just been hijacked. But to make a long story short, we've heard
[41:00.520 --> 41:06.280]  the calls where police and military were laughed at 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 5 years ago.
[41:06.280 --> 41:13.000]  They're not laughed at now, now they're the go-to guys. Now they're the people everybody
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.640]  was constantly calling up for investment advice, for family advice, for new world order advice
[41:18.640 --> 41:21.240]  because they heard you talk about it.
[41:21.240 --> 41:25.360]  I mean, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts has talked about the people he knows in government. But
[41:25.360 --> 41:31.960]  I mean, take another Roberts, Colonel Craig Roberts, who was on the Tulsa Police Department
[41:31.960 --> 41:37.040]  head of the SWAT team, also helicopter pilot, worked on the Oklahoma City bombing as a detective.
[41:37.040 --> 41:40.000]  And he was telling them it was the government exposing all the names, so they put a federal
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.920]  investigation on him, had all the cops spying on him.
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.680]  Cops were getting killed as well that were investigating on the Oklahoma City force.
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.760]  And then now, they all call apologizing and begging to come out to meetings with them
[41:52.760 --> 41:58.680]  and wanna know all about it. And now that he's retired, but I've heard that story hundreds
[41:58.680 --> 42:03.320]  of times to be conservative. So it's the same thing with you and your own life.
[42:03.320 --> 42:06.120]  Educate people now, let them laugh at you. Well, now they're not really laughing. We've
[42:06.120 --> 42:12.200]  kinda gone past that and be a leader in your area. But let me give you the toll free number.
[42:12.200 --> 42:19.840]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 to jam in a few calls ahead of
[42:19.840 --> 42:20.840]  our guest.
[42:20.840 --> 42:25.340]  I'm kind of going off on a rampage here because I start talking about Stockholm syndrome.
[42:25.340 --> 42:34.260]  And Stockholm syndrome got that name decades ago from a case in Stockholm, Europe. But
[42:34.260 --> 42:39.440]  if you study it in history, you see it happen a lot. Where you've got people that are kidnapped,
[42:39.440 --> 42:43.760]  you've got people that are enslaved.
[42:43.760 --> 42:48.440]  There are many cases where police bust into some house where they've got three or four
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.560]  people chained up in a backroom sweatshop who've been prisoners for five, ten years.
[42:53.560 --> 43:00.760]  And the people will fight the police to protect the enslaver. And that's called the Stockholm
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.240]  syndrome. Well, you can also get that towards a corrupt government, like North Korea. You
[43:05.240 --> 43:12.520]  can get mass Stockholm syndrome where people are so scared of a hijacker.
[43:12.520 --> 43:19.600]  They're so scared of an abuser that they end up groveling to them and convincing themselves
[43:19.600 --> 43:25.420]  that the person really has their best interest at heart. And it actually happens now. Some
[43:25.420 --> 43:30.080]  studies back in the 60s and things showed about 25% of people roughly would go under
[43:30.080 --> 43:31.420]  Stockholm very quickly.
[43:31.420 --> 43:36.120]  Now it's over 60% revert to Stockholm. Remember the Stanford research program? They had a
[43:36.120 --> 43:39.920]  few other university programs where they could get graduate students to torture people and
[43:39.920 --> 43:46.200]  then follow orders to kill them. Believing they were killing people, and they found on
[43:46.200 --> 43:52.640]  average over 90% would kill if their professor told them to kill.
[43:52.640 --> 44:06.040]  Well, see, I'm not one of those people. Whenever I talk under my breath and talk to the crew,
[44:06.040 --> 44:08.720]  people are like, what's he talking about? I tell them I'm hearing bleed over. I don't
[44:08.720 --> 44:13.400]  know if it's from the network or what it is, but I got clips in my ear.
[44:13.400 --> 44:19.160]  But sound like bumper music. All right, gotta diagnose that while we're live on the air.
[44:19.160 --> 44:23.940]  People won't find it later. We've been adding some new stuff to the studio so some of that
[44:23.940 --> 44:25.760]  stuff can happen.
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.720]  All right, now continuing here, let's just go to some of your phone calls because I need
[44:30.720 --> 44:35.080]  to reset. And when you hear talk shows say reset, it means you get so many ideas going
[44:35.080 --> 44:41.940]  in your mind, so many points that it's really impossible to then pull back and try to cover
[44:41.940 --> 44:42.940]  it all.
[44:42.940 --> 44:47.280]  But I just want to get this message out to everybody. Having the Stockholm syndrome,
[44:47.280 --> 44:54.000]  loving your abusers, giving into it, doing what it says is going to destroy you. And
[44:54.000 --> 44:58.200]  if you buy into this false reality they're spewing, we're going to have the total implosion
[44:58.200 --> 45:05.560]  of our society and an authoritarian nightmare that is going to look pale in significance.
[45:05.560 --> 45:14.080]  I love Obama. I love Obama. I'm dying for Obama. I will kill for Obama.
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.000]  You will kill for Obama? Yes.
[45:19.000 --> 45:31.640]  And that is just an example of the type of people that are out there who have their payroll
[45:31.640 --> 45:35.880]  taxes raised, their whole future destroyed, and they have childlike looks in their eyes.
[45:35.880 --> 45:43.160]  We could see the videos, the radio listeners, they were just playing. It's just abject three-year-old.
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.360]  It's like a delusional three-year-old. And they love the delusion. They love the Stockholm
[45:47.360 --> 45:51.560]  syndrome. They love the lie.
[45:51.560 --> 46:00.040]  And I've just seen it hundreds and hundreds of times where they're completely childlike.
[46:00.040 --> 46:04.760]  And they completely buy into anything and everything they're told. And for those of
[46:04.760 --> 46:12.800]  us that are awake, there's not just those that are in the Stockholm syndrome. There's
[46:12.800 --> 46:18.920]  also people that are so threatened by it that they're scared deep down so they lie to themselves.
[46:18.920 --> 46:22.520]  And then they also say that those of us that say we know what's going on, that we're showing
[46:22.520 --> 46:30.080]  off, that we think we're smarter than they are, ought to send an email to Papa Bowie
[46:30.080 --> 46:31.200]  of the Howard Stern Show.
[46:31.200 --> 46:34.560]  Because after I was on Howard Stern, it was such a popular interview, I was driving the
[46:34.560 --> 46:39.640]  next day listening to a rebroadcast of the After wrap-up show. And he was saying, well,
[46:39.640 --> 46:44.420]  you know, Alan Jones is an interesting guy, but he thinks he's smarter than other people.
[46:44.420 --> 46:48.440]  He thinks he knows things and sees things that we don't. And then he's like, I just
[46:48.440 --> 46:52.220]  don't see the world being that complex and people having it together.
[46:52.220 --> 46:55.920]  And you know what? You're right. The general public doesn't have it together and things
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.800]  are falling apart and the average person is in a trance. So you're judging the elitist,
[47:00.800 --> 47:06.600]  the globalist off of how you see the world and people around you. See, the globalist
[47:06.600 --> 47:11.920]  are social engineers. They've all written books how they set this up, Bertrand Russell,
[47:11.920 --> 47:13.220]  countless others.
[47:13.220 --> 47:17.280]  So I've read all the books they've written, many of the books, Carol Quigley, Tragedy
[47:17.280 --> 47:22.920]  and Hope, The Anglo-American Establishment by Carol Quigley, The Technotronic Age, Zbigniew
[47:22.920 --> 47:29.800]  Brzezinski, Club of Rome documents. And we've had people take out of the National Archives,
[47:29.800 --> 47:37.120]  you know, that's got restricted do not release senators papers about world government and
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.320]  Bilderberg and, you know, that we publish big breaking stuff.
[47:41.320 --> 47:45.800]  And then it's not even a big deal. People won't even go read the documents. So see,
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.520]  I'm covering something. It's like talking about the last Super Bowl. I know who won
[47:50.520 --> 47:57.040]  the last Super Bowl. I mean, it's not like it's my opinion. I know what happened. It's
[47:57.040 --> 48:00.940]  like saying there was a power outage at the Super Bowl that happened and like, oh, that's
[48:00.940 --> 48:01.940]  your opinion.
[48:01.940 --> 48:05.800]  That was a power outage. And I'm not criticizing him. I want to send him an email and ask to
[48:05.800 --> 48:09.960]  come on his show and like really walk through some of this stuff, because let me tell you
[48:09.960 --> 48:14.320]  what Stockholm syndrome is. It's when you're abused and you defend the abuser because it
[48:14.320 --> 48:16.520]  convinces you that you're in control.
[48:16.520 --> 48:22.600]  You're not in control. You're chained up. And the psychopaths know how to break you
[48:22.600 --> 48:25.840]  and control you where they finally know you're broken and where they can take your chains
[48:25.840 --> 48:32.600]  off and you'll do whatever they say forever. And then you will defend your enslaver because
[48:32.600 --> 48:36.600]  you're delusional. And what you're afraid of is admitting you were conned, that you
[48:36.600 --> 48:37.680]  were manipulated.
[48:37.680 --> 48:44.680]  But the lie begins, that's later. The lie begins by thinking that if you just like this
[48:44.680 --> 48:49.200]  person that's abusing you and do whatever they want, somehow that will give you power
[48:49.200 --> 48:55.840]  over it. Delusional people are into playing tricks. And I've noticed losers and failures
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.600]  always have systems and manipulations they're running and games they're playing.
[49:00.600 --> 49:04.520]  And they imagine things are like dominoes that are going to fall one into the other
[49:04.520 --> 49:09.420]  and some master plan. And it's those very people that will deny there's a globalist
[49:09.420 --> 49:14.200]  master plan, though they're fantasizing about it themselves. But see, the globalist are
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.640]  building on thousands of years of developed survival of the fittest tyrannies out of the
[49:19.640 --> 49:23.160]  Roman and then British model that actually do work.
[49:23.160 --> 49:31.400]  But I've noticed the loser population plays at intrigue, plays at manipulation. And I'm
[49:31.400 --> 49:36.080]  just getting off into a hall of mirrors here in my own mind, just trying to understand
[49:36.080 --> 49:40.760]  what the globalist are up to. But really, they have a philosophy of cheat, don't be
[49:40.760 --> 49:45.920]  for any side, care about no one and then try to manage whatever new crisis there is with
[49:45.920 --> 49:50.160]  more BS because you're in the positions of power.
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.040]  That's why societies end up falling under these people, because they lie to themselves.
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.480]  So if it doesn't make sense at some levels, it's because they're smoking their own dope.
[49:59.480 --> 50:04.080]  The globalist have their own Stockholm syndrome to what they have released. They have their
[50:04.080 --> 50:08.820]  own Stockholm syndrome to what they've created. They think they're in control of this. They
[50:08.820 --> 50:14.880]  think they're the authors of a machine that was started more than 6000 years ago in ancient
[50:14.880 --> 50:27.040]  tyrannies in Egypt, Babylon, Tyre, then Greece, Rome, the Venetians, the Byzantines, on through
[50:27.040 --> 50:33.080]  the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, and then the Renaissance against it.
[50:33.080 --> 50:37.480]  And we are the Renaissance, those of us that are we are the thinkers, we are the lovers.
[50:37.480 --> 50:41.960]  We are the people that believe humanity should be empowered. We're the people that want destiny,
[50:41.960 --> 50:46.080]  that want to taste it, who want to live it, who want to empower, who want to grow, who
[50:46.080 --> 50:49.560]  want to see people win, and the globalist are cancer.
[50:49.560 --> 50:53.520]  They're a bunch of greedy, stunted, wicked people who are in control because they're
[50:53.520 --> 50:58.520]  willing to break the rules like cancer, and they must be routed out. They must be removed.

[55:13.120 --> 55:17.320]  to get serious about what's happening and realize it you know I haven't had a call from
[55:17.320 --> 55:22.680]  this station in years we had this station as an affiliate like 15 years ago I know they've
[55:22.680 --> 55:29.680]  got a couple more stations there so I knew we had a am there but a KC XL 100.29 FM so
[55:30.600 --> 55:37.600]  102.9 in Kansas City Steve in Missouri you're on the air go ahead and thanks for holding
[55:38.440 --> 55:45.440]  yes it's a it's an honor to talk to you you're you're the catalyst for my waking up many
[55:45.440 --> 55:52.320]  years back I was calling because I was thinking yesterday about I've wondered for a while
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.400]  why the Bush regime would would allow the assault weapons ban to expire to begin with
[55:58.400 --> 56:05.400]  and it made me think of Rumsfeld you know arming the North Korea or Iran and Afghanistan
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.040]  and all them guys and kind of arming their enemies before they go to war with them it
[56:12.040 --> 56:17.520]  was just to see what you thought about that well I mean we we've taken back the house
[56:17.520 --> 56:22.040]  to a great extent some good people and so that was defeated but they're acting like
[56:22.040 --> 56:26.300]  it's a victory that Feinstein's bills in trouble she'll get that with the next shooting it's
[56:26.300 --> 56:30.440]  got the end of private sales where you can't give a gun to your grandson or your son or
[56:30.440 --> 56:35.820]  your daughter and where I can't trade guns with my dad or have him go you know hey your
[56:35.820 --> 56:40.680]  great uncle died here's his shotgun I mean the reason I've probably got 50 60 guns is
[56:40.680 --> 56:45.080]  most of them are dead relatives guns I mean a lot of them are and it just ends all that
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.600]  and then registers everything so they can confiscate them when criminals don't even
[56:48.600 --> 56:54.280]  follow the laws so we need to beat all these bills we need to get rid of the 68 gun control
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.880]  act because criminals are going to have guns anyways and they're now creating felonies
[56:58.880 --> 57:05.080]  sir for a battery you know a double-a battery in your backyards five years in jail by accident
[57:05.080 --> 57:08.800]  your kids left out there and I find batteries all the time in my yard because you know the
[57:08.800 --> 57:12.640]  kids play with toys and they fall out I mean and let me tell you I mean I every month I
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.360]  see some guy arrested for that okay I mean I'm not just saying that I mean balloons a
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.080]  balloon goes in the air you're going to jail when we launch balloons all the time my kids
[57:22.080 --> 57:28.040]  love doing it we'll tie something to it I mean it's over and so I say get rid of all
[57:28.040 --> 57:34.180]  gun control laws everything get rid of it all that's the answer go ahead well the founding
[57:34.180 --> 57:39.040]  fathers when the Second Amendment was drafted you know citizens I think you made this point
[57:39.040 --> 57:43.840]  before had cannons there was no there's no you know bigger better armament at the time
[57:43.840 --> 57:49.840]  than a cannon you know they didn't even cross their mind I believe to take the cannons from
[57:49.840 --> 57:53.360]  the people you know I believe that yeah we have a right to bear arms and you know hey
[57:53.360 --> 57:58.880]  last time I checked buddy there are more than 50,000 Barrett semi-auto 50s in America and
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.240]  hundreds of thousands of bolt-action that yeah you could take airplanes down with them
[58:03.240 --> 58:09.960]  there's never been a crime with a 50 except one armored car robbed in what the 80s again
[58:09.960 --> 58:15.800]  again because gun owners are so law-abiding so take all the laws off of us we're good
[58:15.800 --> 58:21.280]  people it's not that we're just law-abiding if you don't trust the people with guns how
[58:21.280 --> 58:26.200]  do you trust the government see the government's always far more dangerous and I know you know
[58:26.200 --> 58:31.400]  that brother all right George we're gonna he's a prison planet TV viewer right now subscriber
[58:31.400 --> 58:37.660]  and come back to him and then Casey and then any others that are patiently holding stay

[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:41.400]  flourishes right there that you just heard that is exactly what we are facing so she's
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:46.360]  going to be joining us with big breaking news the Empire striking back their counter offensive
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:51.680]  right now let's go to George in New Jersey you're on the air sir afternoon to you Alex
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.640]  how are you I'm fine sir thank you for calling real quick I wanted to pass along some information
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:03.240]  regarding the 11 year old who had the health and human services or welfare caseworker show
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:11.200]  up and the police officers visited his home last Friday because of a photo of a 22 caliber
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:19.480]  copy of an AR on Facebook and the police demanded to actually look in the homeowners gun safe
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.680]  I sent a link to a current for you so you could pull that up probably from your website
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:30.020]  at this point what was the headline I'll pull it up family says New Jersey overreacted the
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:35.440]  boy's gun photo that was on the daily journal our local newspaper oh yeah I have it I have
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:41.880]  it so his parents his parents legally have what a lot of kids have it looks like an ar-15
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.600]  but it's a 22 we were just out shooting those with the kids the other day this is a great
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.520]  trainer gun for him and they demanded to come and use that I guess without a warrant is
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:57.000]  the issue because I see that in the news for that it's like they had no warrant whatsoever
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.820]  they just showed up unannounced and well by the way it talks about the camouflage clad
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:09.240]  child I don't always go with fads I only go with a style if it's in and I always love
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.960]  to go hunting and hanging out because I love to wear camouflage and you know it's just
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.840]  fun kind of like being a big kid I'm wearing camo today might wear camo every couple weeks
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.880]  I got a couple shirts that are camo I got a duck hunting you know thing I got decades
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:26.840]  ago I've worn before on air but the point is is that it's fun and they describe him
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:32.080]  as it's very frightening I just saw the article you know he had camo on and a gun let's put
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:35.720]  the evil photo back up and you know this is like kids getting kicked out of school because
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:42.320]  a pastry looks like a gun there's no law but they do it to just create this idea of total
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:48.520]  hysteria to demonize it I totally agree with you I do have a nephew also who has a son
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.280]  who was suspended for three days in New Jersey for pointing his finger in the shape of a
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.760]  gun he is a third grader in the city of Vineland here oh yeah all the video games all the Avenger
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.760]  movies guns guns guns all kids always play with guns we used to take our toy guns to
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.520]  school my dad took his real guns to school to go shooting after school now again pointing
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.440]  your finger that's how they're going to ban the guns is the kids are going to be so neurotic
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:20.120]  growing up that that that just pointing a finger is enough to go to a FEMA camp I actually
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.200]  I'm an electronics tech and I actually did some work putting cameras in school buses
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.960]  I did win a contract for doing that for our local public schools anyway very Orwellian
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.040]  there's a photo that goes above the camera and it's literally right out of 1984 it's
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.960]  a picture of a gentleman's eyes just staring at everybody in the bus you ever notice those
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.040]  photos with eyes no matter where you move they see me always look at you know same thing
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.440]  was done five years ago six years ago in London they put up big signs saying you are now safe
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:54.520]  under the eyes of Big Brother and shows a giant eye in the sky beaming the bus and that
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:00.240]  was the ad for the bus cameras and they're saying no Big Brother is good and in Stockholm
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:06.400]  syndrome they're now literally using 1984 as an owner's manual it's now an instruction
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:12.140]  manual we're talking kindergarten students here who are getting subjected to this sort
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.200]  of nonsense well it's not but again we call it nonsense and I call it that because like
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.200]  this is nonsense it's not it's hardcore brainwashing reeducation camp the public schools are the
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.880]  equivalent of Soviet reeducation centers yeah they force the kids on drugs force them on
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.380]  shots feed them horrible bad food mommy and daddy can't pack lunches the kids write reports
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:38.080]  on what mommy and daddy are doing and they they're there to hurt your child and put them

[01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:15.880]  ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:28.920]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host, Alex
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:37.360]  Jones. It is the 20th day of March 2013 on this Wednesday edition. We are now into the
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:44.160]  second hour. Thank you so much for joining us. Now the EU global control banks are telling
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:49.080]  Cyprus that, hey, we would major shut your bank accounts completely down.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:55.960]  That's being reported by NBC World News. But it's in the fine print, it says Cyprus crisis
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.280]  deepens, bailout rejected, banks may not reopen. And then you read later, well, we'll just
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.960]  never let you have any of your money. We'll just shut them down. And the banks are closed
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:08.760]  right now. They're supposedly gonna reopen on Friday, but now they're saying maybe never
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:16.520]  if you don't do what we say. And then you had Chase JP Morgan customers yesterday evening
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.000]  for two and a half hours or the day before yesterday shows zero.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.040]  People couldn't buy stuff, they couldn't do things. And I think that something suspicious
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.080]  there like to do flash trading. There's tens of billions of dollars of deposits, even more
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.920]  than that. Imagine two and a half hours that money being able to be used from the things
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.280]  moved into other things. I think it's very suspicious. I've talked to IT people and they
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:39.560]  have all those systems backed up.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.560]  You wouldn't have everybody's card go to zero. If there's sun spots or something and a satellite's
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:48.480]  down, not even all the gas stations go down. And it says your card doesn't work, it doesn't
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.000]  give you the data of zero. So I've talked to some IT people and they say it's very,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.760]  very, very suspicious cuz those systems are all backed up.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:01.680]  The banking thing is not on one server or one group of servers. And there's been supposed
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.000]  to hack attacks against South Korea, they say by North Korea. Obama, of course, is going
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.480]  to Israel and others and supposed nerve gas attacks in Syria. They're trying to blame
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.560]  on the government there. A year ago, we told you look for a false flag on that front.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.240]  That is just some of what we're gonna be covering. But what about this report? Attorney says
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:26.720]  prosecution of abortionists who snap newborn babies next is racist. House of Horrors doctor
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:31.520]  charged with killing children that already been born. The point is, is that this is the
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.520]  new thing.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.600]  You don't want government run health care? You're a racist. Don't want to turn your guns
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:40.600]  in, you're racist. If you don't like the weather, it must be. Having any opinion is racist because
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:46.560]  the abortion doctor is a black guy. And of course, most of the babies are black. I mean,
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.480]  it has nothing to do with it.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:56.640]  I mean, they prosecuted white and Asian doctors before. That's on record for doing post partial
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.820]  birth. It's a horrible subject to have to get into. It's just that article's up at info
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:07.600]  wars.com. And Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, goes into how this is
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.840]  always the tactic that they use.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:15.000]  We'll be covering some of that in the next hour after our guest leaves us. We've also
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.560]  got more and more forced drugging of people to make them tell the truth at trial. The
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.320]  case of James Holmes, who was already under weird government psychiatric control. Now
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:28.240]  they want to drug him so he behaves himself and tells the truth that he did it.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.040]  I mean, whoa. And the drugs they're giving him will make you say whatever you're told.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:39.040]  I mean, this is like mind control. Dr. Mingle of stuff out in the open. I want to get John
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.280]  Rappaport on about that. I've been talking about this for a week since they announced
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.000]  it. Now they're going ahead with the drugging. Unprecedented. Also, England is moving to
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.960]  ban open blogging, anonymous blogging as part of their takeover of the press.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.800]  They already have D notices to shut things down. That's in the news. That's the one in
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.360]  Guardian, you name it, saying it's tyranny. I mean, this is all happening all over the
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:07.560]  world. And this is what even CNET News said Obama's cybersecurity plan that has John McCain
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.560]  support bipartisan would do. Chinese style net censorship, that's the quote.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.480]  I mean, it is happening here. Stop saying it can't happen here. Now, we are joined for
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.760]  the balance of the hour and perhaps a little bit into the next hour to take your calls
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:30.080]  behind the green mask. UN of Gen 21, Rosa Corey, the best short primer at only 170 something
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.400]  pages long or 169 pages long.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.640]  Great piece to break down how it works, how they do it. And she's real to the point, focused,
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.720]  well researched, everything she talks about. Cuz I've been on this for 17 years, Gen 21.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:47.480]  Right after it happened 20 years ago, I've been covering it on air for almost 18. I can
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.980]  tell you, this lady knows her stuff and focuses on it full time, so knows more than I do,
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:54.180]  because she specializes in it.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:58.840]  She's on it right now. And I said, what's the latest? They're counter offensive of disinformation,
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.920]  a new hoax saying there is no agenda 21 or it's a loving thing. They're in run down,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.980]  we're gonna go over all of it and just how big this is. But listen, under UNESCO, set
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:13.800]  up by the transhumanist who wasn't really a transhumanist, he founded it, a eugenicist,
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.880]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, on record, set it up to take over the planet.
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:26.060]  It runs your toilet, how big it can be, your light bulbs, what type, cigarette bans, plastic
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:31.160]  bag bans, all these things that sound reasonable, they admit were to set the precedent, so they're
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.160]  in control.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:36.120]  This is global zoning, and then it's we're gonna shut down your power plants, we're not
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:41.160]  gonna let you build, we're gonna tear up your roads. And the good news is, we're countering
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:46.080]  them everywhere, but they are now counter offensing. They're now in a counter offensive
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.340]  and people don't understand it, it's who wants it most.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.000]  They're always gonna come back, we've got to come back. And it's fun to fight them,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.120]  it's not like, guys, they're coming back again. It's fun, you're meant to go to city council
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.820]  or the state house and route them. And a lady who's traveling all over the country and who
[01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:05.760]  is on fire is Rosa Corey, again, her book, discounted, ready for you to give your entire
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.420]  county commissioners, your city council, your state house.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:11.920]  For those of you that wanna be able to keep our free market system and prosperity, you
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.800]  better support us and Rosa and yourself and buy a hundred of these. And don't just give
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.500]  them to your city council, your county commissioners, give them to your pastors, give them to opinion
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.500]  makers.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.480]  Because you in America brainwashes all the best and brightest college students, high
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:31.600]  school students, they recruit them. My first film covers this and shows it, that's how
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:38.000]  they take over. We have to mimic their tactics, but we use the truth, they use lies. And so
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.680]  Rosa Corey joins us in studio and it's the postsustainabilityinstitute.org is one place
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.680]  to visit.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:50.320]  Her also Democrats Against Agenda 21. I am fired up to have you here, Rosa, to give us
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:56.520]  the state of the war with the UN and the private mega banks that created it and are imploding
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.320]  the planet with it. Thank you for joining us.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.520]  I'm so glad to be with you. It's really great to be here.
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.960]  It's fantastic to have you. So I mean, start rolling with what you were telling me out
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:08.120]  there. The latest breaking info, they're counter offensive.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.320]  Well, you know, obviously they're completely shocked. They're back on their heels because
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:20.240]  here we are, you know, people are recognizing that this is something that they want to fight.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.760]  And when you're out there and you're, you know, you're at your city council meeting
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.840]  or you're, you know, you're, you're visiting, you know, some planning commission meeting
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.960]  or you're at your kid's school and you're talking about what's going on, you really
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.960]  want to understand the big picture.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.540]  And so this is obviously there's a lot of disinformation going on to fight us. And there
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:45.920]  are people right on the ground, right in your neighborhood that are out there working against
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:51.200]  you. So you want to be aware. And one thing that's going on, this is sort of funny in
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:59.120]  a way, is the United Nations Association, UNAUSA, their executive director has just
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:05.960]  written an open letter to the legislators of like nine states. And these are the states
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.720]  that are actually launching legislation to fight Agenda 21, saying that we do not want
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.400]  to have anything to do with Agenda 21. And this guy, I posted this on my blog so that
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:22.160]  people can see it. It's actually a propaganda letter to the legislators saying, hey, you
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.500]  know, there's nothing to worry about here. You know, hey, basically, why are you wasting
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:34.520]  our time? Why are you wasting precious legislative time on this non-binding agreement?
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:40.320]  And the truth is that it is in every single piece of legislation. It is in federal, state
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.320]  and local.
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.720]  And we're showing this now from UNAUSA.org. Right when you said it, we punched it up.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.720]  It's on the front of their site. A foreign globalist corporate group is literally here
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.660]  trying to block us at the legislatures, blocking them. And the Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:00.640]  is coming out with reports saying anyone that talks about it is a terrorist. And get this,
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.800]  The L.A. Times said it does not exist, Rosa. So that's how dumb they think their readers
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:09.280]  are. It doesn't exist, Rosa, but their organization is here fighting us.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.880]  Right. It's funny because it's all over the Los Angeles general plan. You know, I mean,
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.160]  literally it is in plan for every city in the United States. It's in all of your plans,
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:24.760]  all of your schools. It's in common core. You'll see it throughout your your legislative
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:29.880]  documents. And this is the reality, even though it's a yes, it was a non-binding document.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.400]  Yes, it's 20 years old, but it was implemented in the United States through the president.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:38.560]  But explain when you sign off on it, HUD and all the agencies then bring you taxpayer money.
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560]  They finance it.
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.860]  Definitely. Yes, because this is what they do. They impoverished the cities. The cities
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.680]  are crashed. The economy has collapsed. The cities are desperate for money. They're like,
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.080]  please give us some money. And the feds say, hey, sure, we'll give you the Partnership
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:59.160]  for Sustainable Communities funds. You'll get grants if you put smart growth in every
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.500]  part of your center.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.600]  And they tell all the top college people, all the top executives at companies, all the
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:08.460]  top kids in high school, we're going to pay for you to be flown to New York. We're going
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:11.800]  to make you part of the U.N. And that's how they've got basically everybody. They tell
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.440]  Miss USA you will not win unless you thank the U.N.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:21.240]  That's right. U.N. USA is a date actually create mock summits that they put on at at
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.360]  schools at high schools and colleges where they train you in Agenda 21. Meanwhile, of
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:31.520]  course, it doesn't exist. Right. Meanwhile, people are being trained in it. They are being
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:38.800]  planners. They're actually being propagandized to to talk to elected officials and planning
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:42.540]  departments and say, hey, Agenda 21 is nothing to worry about.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:48.800]  This is a huge disinformation campaign, but we are fighting it all across the world.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:54.920]  And by the way, my film, America Destroyed by Design, that I shot in 96, put out in 2000,
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.280]  that I shot in 96, put out in 1997. I'm going to show for TV viewers clips of that where
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.960]  I went to model you in at the University of Texas with the high school kids were open
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.360]  communism was being taught.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.640]  Yeah, I mean, they were openly. But but again, this corporate communism. Go ahead. Yeah,
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.340]  it's a corporate togracy. This is, you know, check it out. What globalization really is
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:21.560]  is the standardization of systems. It's creating total uniformity. Right. So that all systems
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.640]  are brought into uniformity, into heart. They call it harmonizing harmonization. And so
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:31.020]  that means what is corporation? What does a corporation want? They want open borders.
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.680]  They want no regulation and they want low wage workers. They want large markets that
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:42.200]  they can sell their goods in. This is what globalization is all about. It makes you part
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:48.100]  of the standardized world. And this is taking all of your information and creating a web
[01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:54.320]  of it. So you're blind, but they can see everything, everything controlled by a giant global authoritarian
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:58.560]  technocracy. Rosa Corey, author behind the green mask more with her on the other side.

[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:13.780]  correct answer will shock you. I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:20.080]  a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:24.660]  this one critical item. In fact, they haven't even given it a thought. And the sad truth
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:29.900]  is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.700]  outside your door. But I have to tell you could literally make the difference between

[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:16.340]  ready to put it up on the satellites and syndicate it very soon. There's already quite a few
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:20.780]  cable systems including in England that downloaded each night near it the next day and some cable
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:25.260]  systems that also play it here in the United States so that's pretty exciting. But again
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:30.700]  thank you for joining us. Rosa Corey anti New World Order pro-liberty activist who ran
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:34.740]  into these people in California getting in the way of what she was doing that's how she
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:39.900]  discovered what they were up to because of her training as a forensic commercial real
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:45.620]  estate appraiser specializing in eminent domain valuation and a lot more. And for TV viewers
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:49.860]  I'm gonna roll some of an online version it's better on the DVD that we obviously sell of
[01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:53.940]  America Destroyed by Design of where I went to a model UN meeting that's just part of
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.380]  the two-hour film because I mean they are brainwashing the children right now while
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:02.060]  saying to the adults this doesn't exist they're telling your kids all their guns need to be
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:06.660]  turned in saying bang bang with a you know their fingers they can be thrown out they're
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:11.820]  giant reeducation centers that's not a figure of speech and you've also got what their futurists
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:16.460]  are pushing for how they intend to impoverish everybody so Rosa Corey start out with what
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.860]  you were talking about with the education.
[01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:24.700]  Basically what we're looking at is schools are not about teaching you information there
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:31.700]  this is this is really a behavioral modification program this is about changing people's behaviors
[01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:35.820]  and so children are being indoctrinated from the time that they're in pre-kindergarten
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:41.260]  all the way to post through postgraduate school and you know taught that basically they're
[01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:46.540]  killing the planet and that it's their responsibility to save it so to create that kind of stress
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:51.700]  in a child of course you can imagine what kind of stress that is and also standardization
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:56.900]  of systems then is required in elementary schools all the way through postgraduate where
[01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:03.340]  kids are being told that they have to learn a certain way and certain things and that
[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:08.440]  and they will be tested we're looking at people who are actually being tested on their mental
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:14.540]  health this is really what's going on in schools this is how people are being evaluated mental
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:19.840]  health evaluations you'll see these happiness surveys and this is all about you know.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.740]  And that's new freedom it's the new prison is to get you in the criminal justice or mental
[01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:27.820]  system right and of course you know prisons are the great public private partnerships
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:33.500]  they get a lot of money for prisons there's restrictions on on how people are moved through
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:38.280]  the system on what you can do in the prisons or giant re-education camps absolutely and
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.340]  so are schools you know because hey you can't not go to school if you don't want to even
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:47.200]  the homeschooling you know if you're using curriculum from you know that standardized
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.100]  curriculum you are actually training your children in the new world order this is what
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]  this is.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.140]  And they make you do that they're not accredited and exactly my kids are homeschooled and most
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:59.700]  of the big materials out there it's all Michelle Obama says this.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.220]  Yeah and of course you know you'll see that in I mean this is so pervasive don't allow
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:09.500]  this to you know to to stymie you don't be paralyzed by it because we are fighting back
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.420]  of course all over the world and you're not going to see it in the mainstream press because
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:17.980]  that's also huge corporate ownership in the mainstream press so they're still putting
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.620]  out the disinformation that oh no this stuff doesn't really exist and this is just a figment
[01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:28.460]  of your fantasy tinfoil hat head right but the reality is is that yes we are really fighting
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:33.620]  back all over the world and you know something that's happening is that kids are being taught
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:40.340]  there is no such thing as objective reality that you cannot know what is real and something
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:46.500]  like that is so evil to do to a child to in fact change mathematics so that it doesn't
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.060]  have the certainty that it should have and instead while it's your it's your opinion
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:54.780]  no they've just joined it I've interviewed the former head of education they were there
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:59.900]  to dumb them down yes I mean it's there to screw them up the test scores aren't dropping
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:05.060]  by accident no it's reinventing they are so-called reinventing mathematics and you know Charlotte
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:09.500]  Isherby she is fabulous of course I know you've interviewed her she has a conference that's
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:15.220]  about to come out on DVD a phenomenal conference of educators that is going to be talking about
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:20.020]  the reality about what is happening now in the school systems because when people are
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:26.180]  subjected to this kind of disinformation as young children they are lost to us you know
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:32.140]  those of us who are older need to pull in and restrict the implement the implementation
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:36.940]  of this plan on our children and of course we're seeing this the futurists you know you're
[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:41.940]  talking about futurists futurists are out there you know especially in Silicon Valley
[01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:47.900]  you're being told that you know the technocracy is so powerful that it's actually crafting
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:54.160]  new government and the city-state will now rise as the most powerful government so we're
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:29:01.220]  looking at the restrictions on on representative government that are going to come longer and
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:06.060]  longer and stronger and stronger until we are literally pushed into these city-state
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:12.340]  mega regions and have no representational no influence on what happens to our government
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:17.980]  and how do they push you in well it's fabulous how this is a brilliant plan honestly a brilliant
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:23.180]  plan because what they're doing is they're moving people out of suburban and rural areas
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:29.780]  through funding mechanisms where they push smart growth which is high-density development
[01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:35.900]  on the city centers and then kill the suburbs and the rural areas with restrictions on on
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:41.740]  water on development on police they charge you more for your electricity everything we're
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:46.060]  going to come right back and break down how they plan to put us in their concentration
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:58.540]  camp cities we're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:25.960]  worldwide it's alex jones we're going back to really an amazing person rosa cory i admire
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:31.160]  people that are already successful in their own life their own business and then get run
[01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:37.220]  over by tyranny and stand up and fight it and she has just reached millions and millions
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:41.720]  and millions of people and reached hundreds of counties and cities and traveled all over
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:46.920]  she's an example of what you can do even on a small level to fight these people and they
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:50.980]  always act like they can't be beaten they always laugh and say yeah there's nothing
[01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:56.160]  going on there's nothing happening that's just a stalling tactic and it's not working
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.300]  anymore we're gonna go back to her in a moment i'm gonna ask her how she thinks they're going
[01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:04.680]  to handle that but first off let's look at drudgereport.com infowars.com has some of
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:10.680]  this reporting but really the up to the minute minute by minute updating is at drudgereport.com
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:17.760]  on obama in israel obama faces battle to woo israeli public global cooling bethlehem rioters
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.360]  set fire to picture of obama white house map erases jerusalem obama netanyahu trade banter
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:31.080]  as they tread a new red line saying you know they've got to attack syria that they've set
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:34.320]  up i mean it's an act that they're fighting with each other ladies and gentlemen that's
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:42.000]  all for public consumption shadow war rages his limo breaks down what is this north korea
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.760]  and it just goes on and on and i was looking at the other headlines where the head of the
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:50.480]  imf who said that you know european she works six seven days a week but she's exempt from
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.040]  the taxes uh how do you pronounce her name i always say lagran but it's a laguard the
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:00.720]  point is is that the police have raided her they raided sarcoza they raid everybody i
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:05.680]  mean it's just all a bunch of crooks and and and you know the last guy that was the head
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:09.560]  of the imf of course uh you know what he was doing supposedly in a hotel room but that
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:14.920]  was a setup and then uh sarcozy put out tweaks before he'd even been arrested showing that
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:22.340]  he was running the whole thing i mean it just seems to never end how crazy all of this is
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:29.080]  and feinstein on reed dropping gun man major betrayal of trust i mean this is all a scam
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.920]  i'm acting like they've been beaten they have the bill now out of the senate committees
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:37.680]  to register all your guns and ban gun shows and not let you give a gun to your dad or
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.520]  your son or your brother uh so they can then confiscate them all by the way i've never
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:45.640]  asked you your opinion your view on the second amendment because even if people can see there's
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.120]  problems with guns sometimes once a lot of liberals and i know you've been a democrat
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:55.060]  uh democrats against 1021 once they see the real tyranny they go oh now i know why there's
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:59.160]  the second amendment i'm not condescending because i don't really know your uh your view
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.760]  on it but i mean so many democrats i know just think of it as a prerequisite to be a
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.960]  liberal that you're anti-gun i think thomas jefferson was broken and he's pretty you know
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.040]  really about as liberal as it gets what is your view on the second amendment rosa cory
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.140]  well i had my own guns from the time i was nine years old my dad took me to the range
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:21.780]  and uh and uh i support the second amendment i think it's important that we uh that we
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:27.560]  do uh have an opportunity to defend ourselves that government that we have is there to defend
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:32.280]  our individual rights that's the only reason to have a government when your government
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:37.080]  becomes uh communitarian government such as the one that we have that we're morphing into
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:43.880]  um we need to rethink how we what our relationship to our government is and i think the second
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:49.480]  amendment is very important and i support it absolutely and i mean that's really the
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.920]  litmus test for people out there uh even if you don't like guns you need to understand
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:58.400]  the power structure wants to disarm you the un has its treaty right now to disarm the
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:03.860]  general population that is their that is their admitted goal uh rosa a plug for the book
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.480]  you know i sell it at infowars.com and infowarsstore.com of course you wrote it you sell it at your
[01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:13.100]  site however people get it whether it's on amazon you name it they need to get it and
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.160]  and who do they give it to because my listeners know all this stuff they've checked it out
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:21.440]  most of them they can always learn something from the book but this is a tool who do you
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:25.500]  recommend we give this to you know it's a cool thing that you just asked me that because
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:32.820]  i just got an order from a woman who's a representative a state legislator in washington state she
[01:37:32.820 --> 01:37:38.880]  just arranged to have 147 books which is the number of legislators they have sent to all
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:44.560]  the legislators in washington state and the books gone out to every sheriff in california
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:49.400]  someone did a sheriff's project and they're working in other states it's very important
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.000]  that people understand what this is this is a big picture book because uh you know agenda
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:00.980]  21 yes it is an old document it is being implemented all across the united states and the world
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:06.280]  so people need to see what it looks like because it's not called agenda 21 you know right here
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.960]  in texas i mean you've got many different names for it you're going to see the smart
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:15.300]  growth new hampshire they call it granite state future it's uh sustainable communities
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.960]  partnerships i mean very many names for it you'll never see it as agenda 21 you need
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:25.280]  to be able to recognize it and that's one reason why when legislators uh you know start
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.400]  to make bans against agenda 21 it's very important that people understand what they're looking
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.740]  at because you can have a state law in place but if you don't know that that state law
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:40.360]  applies to your general plan that you've just passed there in your small town in bass drop
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.560]  texas or whatever you know if you don't understand that then you're not going to know that there's
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.920]  actually a state legislation against what's happening in your town well i mean to explain
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.680]  what it is people that don't know the very banks bankrupting and imploding europe by
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:57.800]  design at the end of world war ii england and the united states had won but the robber
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.680]  barons had won not really america they've beaten one tyranny replace it with another
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.720]  they created the u.n as a global government model on record to take over the world and
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:13.000]  create collectivism to secure the elites control so a fake kind of leftism and and also take
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.040]  over the right and that's what it is and that's what they're doing now now you got interrupted
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:22.000]  by the break a while back describe how they're going to force people out of the rural areas
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.360]  because when they say sustainable they mean the opposite of sustainability because there's
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:30.280]  a lot of stuff that's good that's called sustainable but but that's not they're sustainable so
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.720]  explain what their master plan is how they're counter striking what the world will look
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.300]  like if they succeed yeah what's unsustainable you know according to the u.n it's private
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:44.160]  vehicles private single-family homes meat eating and here we are in texas hope you like
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:50.200]  your barbecue right and uh air conditioning um these are things that are considered to
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.400]  be unsustainable in the world and so when you're out there now think about this you
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.800]  say nobody's coming to get me in my rural you know i've got my spread out there you
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.880]  nobody's coming out there to get me but the way that it happens is that you get charged
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:09.000]  vehicle miles travel taxes for your car so if you're traveling a long distance property
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.280]  taxes your tax they tear up your road no water they shut off the local power plant you're
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:18.500]  going to have metering on your private wells you're going to have restrictions your roads
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:23.220]  and in my county in sonoma county california they're destroying county roads because they
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:29.280]  say there's not enough money because federal money goes to pave roads that are in urbanized
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:32.680]  area they actually destroy the roads they're destroying we're not going to leave it for
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.760]  you we're going to we're going to destroy it they're turning them to gravel because
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.960]  they say they're not going to be able to maintain them and this is like over a thousand miles
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  of roads that they're planning to do this to so this is how it happens you see it's
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:49.160]  not they close your rural roads and your suburban schools uh you're you know they close you
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.440]  out of the uh of the areas that you've been living in and then uh they they don't maintain
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.800]  the infrastructure so when people move out of there there's not enough property and australia
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.840]  is about five years ahead of us they're doing that they're in earnest oh australia is is
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:07.880]  terrible i mean obviously people are really dealing with it all across the world this
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:13.240]  is not just a united states thing i was interviewed on red ice radio which is based in northern
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.040]  europe and you know they they were under the impression that this is some kind of a united
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:23.400]  states program no it is not ichli the international council on local environmental initiatives
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:30.120]  is everywhere they say they uh germany by 2020 it's now law has banned single home dwellings
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.840]  and has put taxes on it to penalize you they're not talking about a one-child policy in europe
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:40.320]  when europe's already dying yeah i mean we're looking at towns like freiburg uh germany
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.800]  which is considered to be the sort of poster child for new urbanism uh high density development
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:50.240]  where they've removed the roads and literally there are no roads there you've got little
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.240]  bicycle paths and if you you know i i don't know where at where they go when it snows
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:00.240]  but uh you know people are being restricted in how they live this is social engineering
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.680]  it's behavioral modification and this is very important to know because you are being indoctrinated
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:09.760]  all the time through the press through your schools through your place of business through
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:15.440]  your uh your entire system and it all sounds good because once they get you to accept okay
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.920]  we'll use less water now they're going to say this this and that let me punch this up
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:24.260]  it was covered by cbs news last week the man for releasing a couple of heart-shaped balloons
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:32.580]  is facing five years in jail for each crime of damaging the environment and uh they have
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:37.920]  arrested him the state police did because they saw the balloons being released uh the
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:44.480]  third degree felony at least five years in jail per balloon 40 year old man no criminal
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:50.600]  record uh again in australia battery on the ground your kid drops five years in jail the
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.880]  green police the outie commercial they're arresting everybody they later admitted no
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:43:00.040]  that's what we're going to do the san francisco mayor bragg no that was produced here that's
[01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:04.760]  part of behavior modification they admit it's brainwashing yeah more things are going to
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.880]  be crime and this is you know you want to see what it's looking like what it's going
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.700]  to look like this is artificial scarcity it's restriction on your use on your ability to
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:17.720]  live free it's making more things crime so that you know pretty soon like i was afraid
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.240]  to go to singapore i thought geez i know i'm going to do something that's against the law
[01:43:21.240 --> 01:43:25.960]  this is the city state the rise of the city state the mega region where literally you
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:32.400]  are being restricted in how you live and this is what agenda 21 is about they admit and
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:35.520]  this is in the austin market statesman that they've doubled the power prices the last
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.720]  five years they're going to double again but the government district and what is seen as
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.400]  the managing district the downtown and terrytown is exempt from power outages and the power
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:50.600]  increases and they said but all of you outside the city that live wrong you're penalized
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:55.800]  there it is yeah the grid is really all about austin is a model un city yes this is you
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.160]  know this is really what it's about this the entire system is set up like this where the
[01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:07.120]  grid is part of it smart growth smart meters all these smart things don't trust this smart
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:13.280]  stuff because what this is is a restriction artificial scarcity a movement away from the
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:18.680]  way that you've been living and monitoring on every aspect of your life this is domestic
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.720]  surveillance we're looking at national defense authorization act we're looking at uh... drones
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:29.160]  we're looking at the way that you are literally being surveilled how about 23 and me where
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:33.640]  uh... you're gonna spit into a cup and give them your dna and this is google owned by
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:38.240]  google you don't you literally won't own your own genes to the human genome has been mapped
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.920]  and you don't own your own they've been taking blood for forty one years in all industrialized
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:48.480]  nations for a u n database that they just now admitted they have and google is all part
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:53.680]  of it look at this from the sun sentinel after watching the romantic gesture the florida
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:59.280]  highway patrol trooper who uh... instead noted probable cause for an environmental crime
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.640]  bransville was charged with polluting to harm humans animals plants except out of the florida
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:12.040]  air and water pollution control act and he again is facing five years per count per balloon
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:15.440]  and their but they're gonna probably end up in jail yeah i wonder if that you know this
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.440]  was uh... to propose to his girlfriend rights are they gonna let me have conjugal physics
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:25.000]  interest unbelievable i mean that's what i mean that they're hiring cops now that literally
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.080]  i mean if they get off on hurting innocent people you know heavy if you look at the way
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:34.200]  police are police officers first of all are terrified you know they're at they're out
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:39.780]  there uh... suited up like that because they are afraid of us and why are they afraid because
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:43.380]  they are creating you know when you've got police officers in public meetings when they
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:48.980]  come in and they ring the walls of a public meeting because you might say something because
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:53.640]  you're being delphi and you don't like it you know this is that describe what we've
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:57.560]  had our guys thrown out of meetings being polite where they say they're public but as
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:02.280]  soon as we ask questions they walk over and follow a playbook and then go you're causing
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:06.680]  a problem get out of here officers i want them out yeah you know i've been chased down

[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.520]  what it's about is to bring groups of people to a pre-determined outcome while giving them
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:07.080]  the uh... the idea that it was you know giving them the oppression false synthesis it's all

[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:59.220]  you've had and am i wrong in saying the only fear we should have is fear itself the only
[01:55:59.220 --> 01:56:03.580]  fear we should have is to not get aggressive and let them take over yeah you know they're
[01:56:03.580 --> 01:56:08.360]  the ones that are taking the non-violent training i mean not to say i'm not talking about being
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.300]  violent okay but what i'm saying is get out there before you need to get violent you don't
[01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.800]  want to have to use your guns because you know what the government's got way bigger
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:21.460]  guns than you've got what we need to do is to get out there and fight this while we can
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:25.540]  and they're in the wrong our time absolutely that's why they stonewall talk about the stonewalling
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:30.980]  oh for crying out loud you know you will be called a tinfoil hat you'll be told that you're
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:35.300]  you know you're a fantasist you will be called a right-winger i've been called a right-winger
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:39.700]  i've been a liberal democrat my entire voting life my parents are liberal democrats you
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:43.120]  were at the highest levels of the of the state department of transportation i worked for
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.280]  the department of transportation discovered all this and you know well i came out i what
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:51.940]  i did was i was appraising property for eminent domain purposes to acquire for freeway projects
[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:56.860]  and i was like hey peep no what happened to private property rights people can't do anything
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:00.940]  with their property anymore how can i value it so you didn't like being in the place of
[01:57:00.940 --> 01:57:06.500]  a tyrant no of course not and obviously i mean i was valuing property at the very highest
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.400]  price that the market would pay and i was finding that you couldn't determine what people
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.260]  could actually sell their property for because you couldn't say what they could and that's
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:18.860]  the tactic the globalists are the only ones that can allow once they steal property they
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.560]  always flip it to themselves and then take the restrictions off you know and this is
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:27.140]  what happens is that the centers of your towns this is what agenda 21 looks like in your
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:31.860]  town it looks like high density smart growth development right in the center of your town
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:38.060]  that is being subsidized with your tax dollars so because of that because you're actually
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:43.280]  paying for this there's no demand for it people don't want to move into those condos and apartments
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.820]  on top of shops most people want to live elsewhere so that money is not there to build those
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:53.740]  things your tax dollars are paying for it and this is what's happening is you're subsidizing
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:58.460]  that and this is the hardscape for your future poverty this is what it's going to look like
[01:57:58.460 --> 01:58:04.080]  because the new frugality is or the new poverty you know the sort of the joy of living with
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:09.260]  oh you go to whole foods every magazine says it's sexy to be pathetic and poor yeah right
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:13.580]  and you know it's going to give all your money to the government yeah and so when you glorify
[01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:18.020]  poverty and when you glorify consensus right it's like you're not going to think for yourself
[01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:21.340]  are you because then you're not you're going to be these people are pathetic you're going
[01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:25.260]  to be ostracized you're not going to be loved by this big group that's going to and they
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:30.580]  you know it's all a fake love it's like being in the schmuck club every tyranny always uses
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.420]  the glorification of the beautiful future and then artificially stay there back in one
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:48.820]  minute i want to hear about this you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today introducing

[02:01:09.780 --> 02:01:13.980]  and be screwed go ahead yeah this passivity thing you know you're supposed to be passive
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:18.620]  you're you know it's about consensus it's about going along to get along you know that
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:25.080]  is the way that that you are taken over who's going to tell you not to raise a stink those
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:29.660]  who are taking you over revolution is bad for business right and this is not revolution
[02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:35.820]  by the way we are exerting our rights this is restoration they're involved in a in a
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:40.300]  revolution they are the revolutionaries they are taking us over you know this is a hostile
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:45.300]  takeover this is a totalitarian state being erected around us right now this is what it
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:50.660]  looks like it's a failed state happening to us right now we're being taken down because
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:55.500]  you know what hey check it out our uh median household income in the united states it's
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:02:00.620]  like 50 000 a year for a household median that's in the middle not the average right
[02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:06.220]  well in the world it's like five thousand dollars for a you know so look at that ten
[02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:11.120]  times so look at how far we have to come down before those markets they're going to bring
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:16.140]  the uh the developing world up a little bit and then take us down why because our wages
[02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:20.380]  are too high because our expectations are too high because we use everything too much
[02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:24.420]  and guess what why would they want to take us out of the land why would they want to
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:29.480]  remove people from the land why do they well yeah i mean at one level density cities they
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.580]  want to collect people into city centers so that we can be more easily monitored controlled
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:40.540]  and surveilled and so that those areas outside the wild lands so that those areas can be
[02:02:40.540 --> 02:02:47.380]  exploited for gas oil uh minerals for uh timber oh yeah no no no when they say they care about
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.660]  the environment it's the complete opposite you will be told that there's scarcity this
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:56.060]  is an artificial scarcity that's being implemented on us right now this is what it's about you
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:03:02.100]  know if you take a look at 1984 that is about artificial scarcity this is how it's done
[02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:06.500]  and so and this is what totalitarianism looks like people think oh no it can't happen here
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:13.180]  hey it's happening here this is what it looks like we need to stand up now this is our moment
[02:03:13.180 --> 02:03:18.540]  nuremberg principles the nuremberg principles are that it is not okay to go along to get
[02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:23.980]  along you cannot say that you were just following orders or that you know everyone else was
[02:03:23.980 --> 02:03:30.080]  doing it that is not all right this is treason and those people who you know this falls in
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:34.520]  with a liberal worldview it's very appealing to a lot of people because they think they're
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.940]  doing yeah they think it's redistribution they don't get that once you're under globalist
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:44.380]  control it's going to be forced population reduction and they've romanticized kind of
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:48.780]  the low level propaganda that oh it's to build a better world it's not building a better
[02:03:48.780 --> 02:03:53.460]  world no it's not and you know what agenda people want to know what agenda 21 is agenda

[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:44.020]  get upset and get aggressive we're going to be usurped we're designed to face an enemy
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:48.740]  coming over the hill to enslave our village that's what we're genetically every race color
[02:08:48.740 --> 02:08:56.020]  creed no instinctively but we're not designed to deal with bureaucracy and propaganda and
[02:08:56.020 --> 02:09:03.020]  taxes and regulations and that's the real 21st century tool and under the globalist
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:07.260]  they want a system that goes backwards to a post-industrial world where we're dumbed
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:11.660]  down we're kept at starvation level we're socially engineered to take the vaccines the
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:16.460]  forced sterilization the forced abortions to quote reduce population and a lot of yuppies
[02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:20.660]  go well there are too many people let me tell you something you're under the attack and
[02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:25.580]  the West is dying Europe will not even be European within another generation okay they
[02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:29.900]  have about 1.3 children same thing here in the US so don't worry you've committed suicide
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:33.980]  and I know you want to make sure you can kill the third world where you want to cut their
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:38.020]  energy supplies as well so I know it gives you a power trip to think about cutting off
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:42.860]  power and being poor and there are problems with a decadent consumerist society I get
[02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:48.100]  all that I get why you think it's sexy but the issue is this isn't even what you're being
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:53.300]  told this is for isn't even it this is a total post-industrial world in Maury Strong's own
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.500]  words and all their books I got a whole bookshelf of them we source them my film Endgame to
[02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:01.880]  shut everything down and create a monopoly of power and have high-tech government and
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:08.140]  corporate reservations that are light years ahead with life extension robotics androids
[02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:13.020]  this is what they're saying a life extension don't read what Ray Kurzweil all of them say
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:19.080]  well we live in the city ghettos around that if we're even allowed to live so so this is
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:24.820]  the shutdown of society so we can be exterminated and it sounds like a science fiction movie
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:28.440]  because they were telling you what they were going to do in the science fiction movies
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:34.320]  that they're really in Bertrand Russell's and others writing so this is the plan it's
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:40.660]  hyper authoritarianism it's a creeping death but it's here where China has you know dead
[02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:45.600]  pigs in the river and fires in the river and suicide nets at the Apple factories because
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:51.080]  they're so liberal Al Gore I mean it must be okay peace bombs I mean Obama and the Republicans
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:53.820]  are all on board with it of course because they're all bought and paid for in the same
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:59.500]  group you know at the highest echelons and they get three new coal power plants totally
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:04.280]  dirty we get three or four shut down a week or more 200 plus a year power prices going
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:10.580]  up we're having the lights turned off they're tearing it all up only the mega cities and
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.700]  that's not just a drudge dread term that's their term that all the maps are public look
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:20.300]  up mega city regions super regions they're shutting us down so it's important to go to
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:24.460]  Rosa Corey's website and see the city council meeting she's been at what she does the planning
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:29.300]  commission meetings get her book read it mimic that because her playbook is dead on truth

[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:39.560]  go be the leader and now we go to these meetings outside Austin they're in every town we outnumber
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:44.740]  them now they're panicking other areas though people aren't waking up so it's a mix go to
[02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:49.020]  the meeting she's got tomorrow in Bastrop the original capital of Texas they were going
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:53.220]  to make it talk like Yoda now Bastrop the original capital of Texas they would make
[02:11:53.220 --> 02:11:59.700]  it you need to go there and fight the empire the fight is now folks this is real James
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:04.340]  Bond stuff okay I mean you want to fight you want adventure you want to fight criminals
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:09.500]  this is it I mean they know they're technicians you will face UN operatives you will face
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:13.620]  globalist operatives okay eight nine minutes left of this segment I'm gonna try to give
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:17.660]  you the floor it's just I started hyperventilating this is so important talk about what we're
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:22.500]  facing of the meeting and and other points you haven't gotten to yet yeah you know hey
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:28.260]  if you're here in Texas that's sustainable places program it's a you know who knows they
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:32.560]  all have the same kind of names but these names are you know interchangeable everywhere
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:38.620]  across the country these are all regional programs that are designed to destroy jurisdictional
[02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:44.420]  boundaries erase jurisdictional boundaries and create these mega regions which you know
[02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:50.260]  America2050.org this is a program and a project of the Rockefeller Foundation the Ford Foundation
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:55.980]  B of A the huge corporations the folks that made the UN this is it this is what they want
[02:12:55.980 --> 02:13:00.580]  to do and this is a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of the world don't
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:05.700]  you know don't think it isn't and it's almost like we've been you know I like to say this
[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:10.060]  it's almost as if there's been a football game going on for the last 20 years and we
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:14.620]  were out in the parking lot having a kegger and now we're suited up we've got our you
[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:19.400]  know our pads on our helmets are on we've got the ball we have the ball now and this
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.660]  is the thing is that when you've got the ball you need to know where the goal is and we
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:29.740]  need to fight to move forward to block all of this and re-erect our freedom how do we
[02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:34.980]  route the enemy tell us this is it you know what let me just say this remember this private
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:40.380]  property rights include your person your body your mind oh they're now saying they're gonna
[02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:45.300]  force vaccines on us that's part of UN most important private property you know this is
[02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:49.460]  it hey when my mother was dying in the hospital they told me I had to go get a flu shot in
[02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:53.900]  order to spend time with her I went down to the basement picked up a receipt out of the
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:59.060]  trash and went back up and gave it to them I didn't get a flu shot this is these things
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:05.260]  are designed to restrict you to make you fall into line to be obedient you know hey when
[02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:11.020]  you're in the airport don't go through that thing go early and make them do the pat down
[02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:17.860]  on you start saying no resist do not go along expose collaborators and refuse to collaborate
[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:22.300]  yourself if you're getting money from this plan if you're you know examine what you're
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:27.180]  doing examine your life hey if you're smoking weed out there on the couch you know what
[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:32.180]  put it down make those flyers and get out there and get this information take it personal
[02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:36.820]  this is your life there's no joking around here this is the time to do it if we don't
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:42.380]  do it now we are not going to be doing it we have a window now let's move through it
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:48.380]  we are actually raising awareness all over the world and things are happening all over
[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:54.100]  the world this is a change you've got to know your enemy identify nonprofits the collaborators
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:58.440]  the consultants that are putting these plans together you want to call them out you want
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.660]  to identify how much money is being paid to them yeah that's how they pay the mercenaries
[02:15:02.660 --> 02:15:08.060]  describe your speech tomorrow I mean how you identify these people oh well it's it's all
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:13.020]  over of course there are you know here's how it is done basically the federal government
[02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:17.900]  gives money to the local agents the local governments and the metropolitan planning
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:23.540]  organizations and the councils of government and here in Texas you've got like 27 of them
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:28.580]  across the United States there are 500 this is where the money comes down all the federal
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:35.180]  agencies have actually changed their policies to bring them into alignment with Agenda 21
[02:15:35.180 --> 02:15:40.180]  and the local agencies are doing the same thing so you want to expose this you want
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:45.720]  to identify it and then you want to block it you want to speak out show up and speak
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:50.500]  out do not be afraid because if you don't do this you know they're gonna if this is
[02:15:50.500 --> 02:15:54.060]  the way it works with collaborative government this is what you're getting consensus government
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:16:00.140]  if you don't speak out they assume that you agree can you believe that they assume that
[02:16:00.140 --> 02:16:05.380]  you agree and because you don't have representative government anymore then it's all by consensus
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:11.260]  and collaboration so if you're not there they assume it's an implicit agreement and it's
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:16.940]  all under admiralty administrative they're transferring the state constitutions and having
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:21.860]  the counties and cities criminally shine over authority to regional boards run by their
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:26.900]  unelected criminals that's it these are appointed boards you cannot get them out you can't influence
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:31.700]  them they're made up of elected officials but there's like there may be 80 or 100 people
[02:16:31.700 --> 02:16:35.460]  on that board so if you've got an elected official from your town who you've you know
[02:16:35.460 --> 02:16:39.700]  convinced that this is a bad idea that guy has got or woman is not going to have much
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:45.220]  of a voice this is what happens with consensus government this is a nightmare we need to
[02:16:45.220 --> 02:16:51.140]  block it to call it out and to refuse to collaborate and we need numbers we need to you do it in
[02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:54.960]  your small town you know what there's no Switzerland in this fight don't think you're gonna go
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:59.700]  hide in your bunker you're not okay you may stay there for a while but what's gonna happen
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:04.360]  when you come out the thing is you need to be there in your small town right now you
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:10.540]  go down and you speak out you call this out name it it is agenda 21 sustainable development
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:16.460]  name it refuse to allow yourself to be sidelined or shamed or embarrassed just like this look
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:20.200]  at how the banks brag they've conquered Europe here's the Financial Times of London print
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:25.640]  out that headline here they are folks this is it yeah by making your land worthless they
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.740]  double the value of their land right draw the links you know that's one thing in my
[02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:33.860]  book you know and that's why I wrote that book I can't go all over the you know I mean

[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:43.580]  info and it's on the website too and you know it's all over people are getting this information
[02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:48.980]  now now the direct line is from the United Nations plan into the federal government through
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:53.880]  the President's Council on sustainable development and then right down into your state and local
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:59.180]  government it is not some plan that's not out there that doesn't have any impact on
[02:17:59.180 --> 02:18:05.020]  you it is a real plan and happening now it has been happening for 20 years it has changed
[02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:10.360]  your school system it's changed your government and you are you know don't allow yourself
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:15.300]  to be victimized by it you take your take it personal but look at like your mother first
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:19.080]  they try to make the nurses take it there's no law now it's laws they're trying to pass
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:22.920]  at state level and have passed in some states where you can't even be in child care that
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:27.620]  means a coach little league whatever if you don't take hundreds of shots they want and
[02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:32.100]  there's no law so they're trying to get laws but they would just say can't see your mother
[02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:36.100]  unless you take a shot that they admit doubles your chances of getting the flu in their own
[02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:42.720]  studies it's just pure mafia color of law where big pharma says hospital do this yeah
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:48.300]  and then they order you and everybody follows orders what empowers this following tyrannical

[02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:08.700]  government's answer is billions of bullets and tanks and checkpoints and then to say
[02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:13.480]  there are no checkpoints there are no tanks when they all have tsa checkpoints in downtown
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:18.740]  austin yeah i mean it's just it's crazy yeah well that you know the thing is is that what

[02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:43.420]  dissenters how did they know who they were in a group of three people one of those people
[02:25:43.420 --> 02:25:48.540]  would be a spy can you imagine the amount of people that you need to do a network like
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:53.660]  that and what we have right now with domestic surveillance with drones with restrictions
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:58.340]  with uh with uh people who have infiltrated neighborhoods they're right down into your
[02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:03.380]  neighborhood associations they look just like you and there's they are the people who are
[02:26:03.380 --> 02:26:08.580]  uh hired as consultants as uh people who are pushing these plans they make some of them
[02:26:08.580 --> 02:26:12.380]  think they're doing the right listen we've had guys in suits come out when we're doing
[02:26:12.380 --> 02:26:15.780]  men on the street things and then we find out they're local bureaucrats and they will
[02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:19.380]  call the police on us for being on a street corner doing interviews they'll walk over
[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:23.580]  and this is on tape and go uh i got some money for you to talk to them and they're already

[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:39.300]  collaborator this is treason but you know what there are a lot more of us and one thing
[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:44.380]  you know yeah i'm a i'm a left liberal but you know what this is a non-partisan fight
[02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:47.700]  that's why you're wearing purple yeah and the thing that's exactly right we're not blue
[02:26:47.700 --> 02:26:53.180]  and red we are you know let's be a nation let's be a nation of individuals we come together
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:57.740]  as individuals i like that idea the purple movement yeah did you invent that idea no
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:02.580]  i think uh well of course it's my little undercover gay thing too because i am gay but you know
[02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:07.180]  yeah no obviously that's what we are right we are one country i don't know purple had
[02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:10.300]  something to do with being gay but well that's because you're not gay so you don't know okay
[02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:15.740]  well explain to me my whole deal is i like the idea of saying blue and red exactly yeah
[02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:20.120]  no it's because this terrifies those in power you want to terrify the people who are running
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:25.900]  this thing you make common cause with people who are on the left you find what it is if

[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:15.020]  the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals

[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:41.160]  as you know it their their plan to end towns cities everything and only have mega cities
[02:33:41.160 --> 02:33:46.500]  that are above the law with globalists in them operating as city states like the vatican
[02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:50.460]  is an example of i'm not demonizing catholics of the vatican i'm saying that's the model
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:55.020]  or the city of london within london that financial capital or how israel is kind of you know
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:59.300]  outside the un does whatever it wants that is going to be the model she was talking about

[02:34:04.740 --> 02:34:09.220]  that people talk about discrimination on race or sex or things like this they obsess on
[02:34:09.220 --> 02:34:14.880]  that all day and the old fights to get us fighting with each other when to shut down
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.340]  over 200 power plants in obama's first four years that were clean burning and to see power
[02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:26.140]  prices go up everywhere i mean that is when you attack a country bombers flying in and
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:32.300]  bomb the power plants the globalists are are destroying our infrastructure paying 22 billion
[02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:37.180]  dollars a ship general motors to china brazil and eastern europe you're like well don't
[02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:40.500]  like the chinese what's they can have suicide nets it doesn't they're actually going down
[02:34:40.500 --> 02:34:45.380]  they're not going up that they force everybody off their land in southern mexico and into
[02:34:45.380 --> 02:34:49.540]  the maquiladores and then they're up here what choice do they have and then oh the government's
[02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:53.180]  like get some free welfare not to empower them to make them clients to then vote to
[02:34:53.180 --> 02:34:58.700]  take the guns it's all balkanization the globalist want more chaos because they're exempt from
[02:34:58.700 --> 02:35:05.440]  it all and they're just crushing things smashing things so they're left standing and then they
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:09.580]  get paid to come in and clean up what they've done they get it coming going they they play
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:15.200]  all sides just like they create al-qaeda create taliban empower them so they have a reason
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:18.700]  to be there and get all the opium and now it's all coming out with karzai saying you
[02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:22.380]  run al-qaeda you run taliban i don't just believe karzai it's they're using them in
[02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:27.100]  libya and syria it's not people say you say america did that the globalists that run our
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:32.340]  country created the soviets on record that's all declassified now they've had new york
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:36.700]  times articles having to admit well they declassified the russian stuff turns out mccarthy was right
[02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:41.300]  but he was limited to what he was doing they were using him to then persecute low-level
[02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:48.420]  communist instead when he said the army runs russia oh that's it you're discredited when
[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:52.480]  you figure out the globalist are full spectrum dominance they will play all the major sides
[02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:57.100]  but they don't play we the people they don't control you they don't control me and there's
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:36:01.740]  a lot of good people in the system as well this is a very criminal group a very small
[02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:08.140]  group doing this it's it every case it's the jp morgan chase goldman sachs um it's the
[02:36:08.140 --> 02:36:13.860]  rockefeller foundation go look at who funds all this the rockefeller's name is on everything

[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:24.700]  david rockefeller probably more than queen of england and her cousins uh sachs coburg
[02:36:24.700 --> 02:36:28.980]  gotha who's their queen beatrix who i mean that woman's probably more powerful than queen
[02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:33.020]  of england because she's hands-on and now she's handing it over to her son who's really

[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:18.700]  going to calls am i right in saying that we are just having magic level success right
[02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:24.700]  now because old timers warn people for so long planted the seeds got called cooks but
[02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:28.220]  now everybody remembers they were told about this 20 years ago i mean are we not seeing
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:32.540]  a giant wake up right now when obama raises taxes on poor people and promised he wouldn't
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:37.020]  yeah it's really incredible what's happening not just across the united states only but
[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:42.060]  around the world this is and of course the people's media like you alex i mean this you
[02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:46.120]  know with the internet people are beginning to recognize that hey they're not alone they
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:53.860]  are part of a huge worldwide grassroots nonpartisan movement to stop united nations agenda 21
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:59.020]  sustainable development so you know obviously real solidarity and listen this is public
[02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:04.700]  private partnership so when you see that seaman's corporation the old nazi corporation and ge
[02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:09.700]  and ibm these are the nazi collaborators they didn't go away you know people think hey do

[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:21.700]  down to access tv to visit me and i checked and it was an fbi agent that i was being tracked
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:26.340]  when i made that america story by design film because nobody was covering un agenda 21 then
[02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:31.540]  i mean that's in that film and i said who's tracking me and he said basically operatives
[02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:36.460]  of seaman's look into that and it's funny you just said seaman's seaman's usa is a huge
[02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:44.140]  player we have a page on our website democrats against un agenda 21 on who funds agenda 21

[02:41:24.780 --> 02:41:30.700]  government is disappearing in america i can't hand out magazines in austin until i went

[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:38.140]  to sue all of you and they had to back off but my god and the police were even later
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:42.520]  going we're sorry we were ordered to do it it's like you're sorry you better be sorry
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:46.620]  that you ever follow the order was i mean do you really want to have no look they'll

[02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:56.740]  don't you get it people you're not part of the establishment it hates you did you get
[02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:01.340]  a memo about hydrophil hydrofluorosic acid did you get a memo about gmo or aspartame
[02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:05.660]  did you get a memo about it killing you and your family no you didn't you're not part
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:09.880]  of the power structure you're either going to just lay down and love evil and think you're
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:14.240]  part of it and crawl along for a while or you're going to come in and jump on the team
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:19.920]  for the big win and you know what alex your listeners are on board but now they need to
[02:42:19.920 --> 02:42:25.820]  do something okay whatever you're doing do more you can do more put out these flyers
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:30.980]  get the information out talk about it show up at meetings anti delphi yeah briefly and
[02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:36.020]  i promise we're going to calls but briefly how do you anti delphi briefly basically i
[02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:40.260]  gave the whole layout in the back of my book okay and it's exact you know you really there's
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:44.960]  a video of people doing it we have on your site yes and we have you know near riot at
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:49.740]  delphi meeting where we literally took down a government meeting because they were delphying
[02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:54.680]  us and we refused to cooperate basically you want to refuse to go along to get along but
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:59.660]  you have to do it carefully or they will actually make it seem as if you are you know somebody
[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:04.300]  who's disrupting the meeting and they'll bring the cops in if you bring the cops in it obviously
[02:43:04.300 --> 02:43:09.400]  shows that this is not just some sort of hunky dory groovy little it's done as intimidation
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:12.940]  these are would-be authoritarians if they could they would put your whole family in
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:17.540]  a gulag right a guy just won 15 million dollars for borrowing his buddy's car was locked up
[02:43:17.540 --> 02:43:21.900]  for years no one knew where he was in a new mexico jail they're now putting people in
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:26.220]  jail for five years over balloons go ahead yeah well basically what you're going to do
[02:43:26.220 --> 02:43:31.460]  is ask the hard questions and then you want to back each other up you do this with a team
[02:43:31.460 --> 02:43:37.040]  so you refuse to allow yourselves to be sidelined you refuse to allow yourselves to be shamed
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:41.220]  because that's what humanitarianism is all about it's about shaming you for actually
[02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:46.500]  speaking out so you want to speak out you want to support each other in these meetings
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:50.980]  that's right exactly because they'll have their operatives planted to try to turn the
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:55.980]  cattle so you have your people spread out who just start popping up and it totally freaks
[02:43:55.980 --> 02:43:59.540]  them out right it totally freaks them out and then you basically want to let them know
[02:43:59.540 --> 02:44:04.580]  that you know what's up and eventually when you do this and you do this well you have
[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:09.700]  not worn your name tag you're not identifying yourself you are going in as a freedom force
[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:14.880]  you do it with other people you don't identify yourselves to each other you do it as a sort
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:18.500]  of a stealth force because this is a and i'm telling you folks if you get happy when your
[02:44:18.500 --> 02:44:23.980]  team wins the super bowl when you destroy their operations it is champagne time it is
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:29.700]  a yeah it's a big hit and then you take it on the road and you do it in the towns near
[02:44:29.700 --> 02:44:34.540]  you and you start supporting other groups and pretty soon you guys are outnumbering
[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:38.820]  the people who are running these meetings the consultants and the planners and the people
[02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:43.260]  who've been paid and look how they sit there real smug they always try to act like that
[02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:48.140]  they're invincible but it's all wizard of oz crap i'm sorry it really is they are snowing
[02:44:48.140 --> 02:44:53.500]  you they this whole thing is designed to give you the impression that this is your idea
[02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:58.760]  they are literally snowing you in every one of these meetings and if you refuse to go
[02:44:58.760 --> 02:45:05.940]  it is not your plan you are there to show the people that it is not your plan that you
[02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:11.700]  do not agree that you don't want to go along to get along with sustainable places project
[02:45:11.700 --> 02:45:17.780]  here in texas or granite state future or one bay area and by the way we are suing to stop
[02:45:17.780 --> 02:45:23.540]  the plan in our area in the nine county san francisco bay area one bay area this is putting
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:29.540]  you guys on notice metropolitan planning organization and california and all across the world we
[02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:34.460]  are suing and your weapon is due process we are civil rights constitution that's right
[02:45:34.460 --> 02:45:39.980]  and whatever it's a constitutional violation and we are not going to stand for it we will
[02:45:39.980 --> 02:45:45.420]  block this we will not look at this lady's got a fighting spirit and it's infectious
[02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:49.100]  i love it i love it i love it let me tell you there's nothing more disgusting than these
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:54.540]  smug puss buckets that go around trying to rob and take over our towns and suck people
[02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:59.380]  dry and then have code enforcers in police uniforms arresting old ladies who haven't
[02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:04.100]  mowed their yard and three thousand dollar a day fines i mean these folks it is blood
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:08.060]  boiling yeah okay they need to be in prison that's what it looks like you know what's
[02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:14.700]  it look like traffic calming uh uh code enforcement um it looks like form-based codes it looks
[02:46:14.700 --> 02:46:21.380]  like scenic byways vision 2025 your general plan your master plan your comprehensive plan
[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:25.900]  public private partnerships transit oriented development it's you can't smoke in your apartment

[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:37.340]  to scare people but i mean just they are thugs people should know that i think you should
[02:48:37.340 --> 02:48:41.340]  go out and experience how they're mafia folks then you'll know how real it is you know what
[02:48:41.340 --> 02:48:45.340]  the more of us that are on board the left hey you threw they did stuff to you now they're
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:50.380]  on the run that's right this is it you know what don't buckle under stand up you can do
[02:48:50.380 --> 02:48:55.940]  it you know if you if you're if you need to work for them you know quit that job if you
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:49:00.220]  see people that are doing these jobs and you have some money you say to them listen i'm
[02:49:00.220 --> 02:49:05.380]  going to make it possible for you to quit that job so that you can i i was in memphis
[02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:09.500]  and i was speaking there and they had the office of sustainability uh director there
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:14.540]  and i said i i said after you hear my speech i want you to go in and resign and i looked
[02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:17.680]  at the people in the audience and i said you know what if this man goes in and resigns
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:22.740]  today you the community have to make sure that he is financially okay this is what we
[02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:27.460]  need to do we need to rebuild real community because this plan destroys and by the way
[02:49:27.460 --> 02:49:34.020]  whenever you do the right thing and sacrifice something doors just fly open i mean that's
[02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:38.540]  what frustrates me is moving against evil is effective people just don't even think
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:42.540]  they're in the game i mean they literally aren't even on the field they just think evil
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:46.340]  has free reign yeah right and you know what we're so isolated from one another and we
[02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:51.060]  think that you know what we do as an individual has no power believe me what you do as an
[02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:56.820]  individual has tremendous power we are tremendously powerful as why do you think they said we
[02:49:56.820 --> 02:50:01.260]  couldn't hand our magazines out anywhere downtown they don't want you spreading the information
[02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:05.060]  and they want to intimidate you refuse to be intimidated no i just redoubled my efforts
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:10.060]  that's right exactly this is the answer is when they push you down come up twice strong
[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:14.620]  twice as hard this is the thing to do this is how you be isn't that just natural i mean
[02:50:14.620 --> 02:50:18.820]  i don't understand people are like wow you're standing up to them i mean i i mean they're
[02:50:18.820 --> 02:50:23.340]  trying to dominate us people we got to get angry yeah and you know what once again i
[02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:26.700]  want to say you know and it's not like i hate weed or something like that but i really i
[02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:32.300]  know there's a lot of smokers watching this don't allow that passivity to take you over
[02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:35.900]  that block that get well no that's why they're acting like the new civil rights movement
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:41.180]  is only marijuana because for most people it does make them passive it does and it lowers
[02:50:41.180 --> 02:50:47.500]  men's testosterone perfect drug for the new world order it makes you totally passive object

[02:55:34.980 --> 02:55:39.860]  okay um council of foreign relations in the un since you know things like that are kind
[02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:47.180]  of intertwined with each other uh rick warren is a known member of the cfr and obama's good
[02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:52.460]  buddy he's going around thousands and thousands of different churches are taking out crosses

[02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:03.060]  like that how do i approach a preacher because bales should be going off that this guy's
[02:56:03.060 --> 02:56:09.500]  not good how to approach preachers and tell them hey you know what you're doing is not
[02:56:09.500 --> 02:56:16.780]  good uh well i mean uh i've talked to family and friends all over the country where methodist
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:21.420]  churches you name it are pulling out the cross and saying we don't worship jesus anymore
[02:56:21.420 --> 02:56:26.240]  it's bad and it's a soviet takeover and people are now no that's not extreme and the point
[02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:30.780]  is if someone isn't a christian or isn't religious that's their issue we're not even here judging
[02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:36.580]  them it's that it's happening everywhere everything's being changed everything's being overthrown
[02:56:36.580 --> 02:56:42.060]  with a fake liberalism that isn't liberalism it's a conformist uh what happened in the
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:47.220]  soviet union or communist china uh rosa corry comments on that yeah you know if your pastor's
[02:56:47.220 --> 02:56:51.540]  out there talking about sustainability sustainable development you better go have a chat with
[02:56:51.540 --> 02:56:56.940]  your pastor because well the first baptist church right here or the first methodist teaches
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:01.540]  sustainability un bill gates is our savior they actually say bill gates is our god yeah
[02:57:01.540 --> 02:57:05.660]  and you know i i've done quite a bit of research on this and obviously you know when you're
[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:12.380]  looking at um uh kind of the the new zen the idea that you want to uh you want to accept
[02:57:12.380 --> 02:57:17.700]  what is and you want to leave the mind behind you know this is separating the mind and body
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:22.300]  so you want to release the mind this is exactly you're out in san francisco in an area so
[02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:26.860]  you know what it's like no it's it's the new coolness is to be a chump they actually say
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:31.620]  i want to be a slave right yeah and i mean if you look at uh i think it's called blue
[02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:35.820]  the blue pyramid or something like that about you know how you're supposed to uh surround
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:39.500]  yourself with people who believe the same way that you do drink two glasses of wine
[02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:43.900]  a day and meditate and that's what google does now it puts you in a little subgroup
[02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:47.380]  it knows your algorithm and then only keeps you in a group that agrees with you right
[02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:52.160]  and so you're being you are actually being manipulated and so are the churches your pastors
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:57.560]  i we're in a body snatcher level conspiracy totally i mean folks i mean people that say

[02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:13.060]  are subverting religion they're saying that religion has to take on the ecology model
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:18.100]  or it will disappear that's the un one world government religion that revelation talks

[02:59:55.380 --> 03:00:02.900]  the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network i shot a video that's
[03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:07.500]  up on info wars.com where i break down the fact that the technology and the way it's
[03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:14.980]  set up it doesn't jive it doesn't fit that if you're looking at what happened with chase
[03:00:14.980 --> 03:00:20.220]  having zero balances two days ago for all its customers in the united states if you
[03:00:20.220 --> 03:00:24.820]  see that it just doesn't fit i believe it's some type of test trial balloon just like
[03:00:24.820 --> 03:00:31.440]  they're now talking about taking all the money out of the bank accounts that are there in
[03:00:31.440 --> 03:00:36.300]  cyprus they're talking about now doing it in italy now in spain this is a very very
[03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:42.860]  serious thing that's going on that you've got supposed hack attacks that are also going
[03:00:42.860 --> 03:00:48.780]  on with south korea versus north korea they're saying they believe north korea did it when
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:52.720]  north korea's got the technical expertise to you know kill a bunch of villagers and
[03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:57.020]  drive around the 57 chevys i mean because they can't even build cars that's about it
[03:00:57.020 --> 03:01:01.800]  very very suspicious there they launched stuxnet of course against iran four years ago and
[03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:07.920]  then blamed it on hackers and said we need to get rid of web freedom because of stuxnet
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:11.340]  so this whole thing stinks to high heaven they're implying it could have been a hack
[03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:16.140]  of chase that did this to show balances of zero everywhere when that stuff is all compartmentalized
[03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:20.900]  and again multiple systems don't buy it on any front and again the germans are saying
[03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:25.020]  to the eu uh just let us have the 10 or we just won't open the banks ever to get the
[03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:28.800]  money period and the banks are shut they're not letting them have their money until they
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:33.480]  agree to give them 10 and set the precedent to give them money all the time and again
[03:01:33.480 --> 03:01:39.480]  obamacare all this is meant to bankrupt you it's meant to drive you into submission other
[03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:48.960]  news press regulation a victory for the rich celebrated and the powerful that's the london
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:54.420]  guardian and it goes on freedom to blog in danger due to new press regulations yeah they
[03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:59.180]  want it where you can't even photograph famous people where you where you have to you can't

[03:02:21.680 --> 03:02:26.880]  going on that's what these tyrants are doing because we're hurting them right now they're
[03:02:26.880 --> 03:02:32.440]  telling you you're weak they're telling you you don't have power because you do have power
[03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:36.240]  okay ladies and gentlemen look at this group of articles right here on the health front
[03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:45.220]  test of anthrax vaccine in children gets tentative okay this is from reuters a presidential ethics
[03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:49.880]  panel they're the ones the ethics panels decide to have death panels and then they appoint
[03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:53.740]  the people that will say to kill granny or kill the kid or kill kids up to age three
[03:02:53.740 --> 03:02:58.240]  that's the that's the bioethics panels that are calling for that they say give experimental
[03:02:58.240 --> 03:03:04.300]  anthrax shots to newborn babies and let's make it mandatory as well oh want to see your
[03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:09.260]  mom got to take these shots in the hospital oh want your kids in little league everybody's
[03:03:09.260 --> 03:03:14.320]  got to take shots to even be on the field it's a policy but now they've got laws passed
[03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:20.280]  in california trying to pass in texas to make it the law anyone that comes around children
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:24.840]  including the way i see it written parents there's 120 something shots we're going to
[03:03:24.840 --> 03:03:30.360]  make you take now some shots have up to six different things in them i mean killing us
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:35.280]  openly i mean they tried this anthrax shots on the troops three different times and killed
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:40.600]  so many people they had to stop but see it's over the top to see can we kill a bunch of
[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:45.560]  people maim them even take their kids i mean watch out if you want to sacrifice your baby
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:49.720]  to satan when they shoot them up with all this keep them there because you know most
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:52.540]  satanists don't want to actually get in trouble i mean if you're into killing your kid which
[03:03:52.540 --> 03:03:57.120]  i know some of you are have the sacrament of the murder in the hospital but make sure
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:00.720]  the hospital you know is openly with the killing or they're going to blame you when the kid
[03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:06.320]  dies at home okay so i just understand your sacrament is very important because some of
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:09.800]  you actually enjoy killing your children this is all kind of a little inside fun thing a
[03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:13.960]  lot of abortionists it comes out i'm not joking by the way there a lot of abortionists it's
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:18.040]  true the stranger the fiction a lot of abortionists it turns out get the job because they're satanist
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:22.080]  you can look that up it's come out and they like to take the baby out at the nine month
[03:04:22.080 --> 03:04:26.360]  and then chop it up right there and everybody gets off on it then they save little mementos
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:29.880]  and i know i'm not trendy because i'm not into that i'm not really you know hanging
[03:04:29.880 --> 03:04:37.780]  with the devil man you know it's fun get down with satan oh yeah chop that baby up i'm not
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:44.320]  cool enough to get into that cat daddy yo baby yeah all right now speaking you guys
[03:04:44.320 --> 03:04:50.800]  are all smiling in there was that uh particularly insane uh that's just we're not cool we like
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:54.600]  babies you heard the abortionists when they're like please let us adopt the baby they are
[03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:59.080]  ugly black babies we will kill them now everybody's like oh my gosh like that's racist to say
[03:04:59.080 --> 03:05:02.740]  it's not good to kill the black baby that's actually in the news today uh they arrested
[03:05:02.740 --> 03:05:05.680]  one of these guys for uh reportedly chopping them up after they were already out of the
[03:05:05.680 --> 03:05:08.920]  body you know they could have been adopted right there uh richard and they're calling
[03:05:08.920 --> 03:05:15.240]  it racist if you don't want to chop up the black babies are you a racist richard well
[03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:19.240]  i guess we're all racist for being concerned about chase giving zero balances to people
[03:05:19.240 --> 03:05:24.560]  for a period of time and i guess we're since we're all concerned about babies getting anthrax
[03:05:24.560 --> 03:05:30.000]  vaccines that are in test phase in any phase period i guess we're racist for being concerned
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:33.120]  about all they have a high kill rate i mean we got to kill these babies i mean that's
[03:05:33.120 --> 03:05:37.240]  liberal well too many people richard it's kind of like uh that news story that you've
[03:05:37.240 --> 03:05:40.920]  played over and over about the mercurys being beneficial from the new world no they said
[03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:44.760]  mercury helps the child that's right helps kill them yeah your perspective it does help
[03:05:44.760 --> 03:05:50.200]  the child so i guess uh we just had we're just not cool enough yet but uh we're working
[03:05:50.200 --> 03:05:53.840]  on it though definitely on the racist side of being concerned about this you don't want
[03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:57.560]  to kill babies i don't want to kill babies no i don't actually have the article out today
[03:05:57.560 --> 03:06:02.640]  it's up at info wars.com it's racist to not want to have the abortions you didn't here's
[03:06:02.640 --> 03:06:10.800]  the headline oh i believe you it's uh it's just amazing the anaconda uh just keeps on

[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:03.280]  a big clemson study research study on two of the signature products the beontane tangerine
[03:08:03.280 --> 03:08:08.760]  and the ultimate classic and in here it talks about that when beontane tangerine ultimate
[03:08:08.760 --> 03:08:13.620]  classic were administered to healthy human cell lines they did not induce or create any
[03:08:13.620 --> 03:08:19.320]  inflammatory response in levels above and below the recommended dosages beontane tangerine
[03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:23.640]  ultimate classic also showed inflammation protective properties and heightened the body's
[03:08:23.640 --> 03:08:27.680]  protective responses to possible inflammation well that's not good it's the vaccines that
[03:08:27.680 --> 03:08:35.240]  kill the baby when the brain swells so that's bad vaccine kill baby good uh this stuff bringing
[03:08:35.240 --> 03:08:40.640]  down inflammation helping the immune system killing cancer cells bad exactly life bad
[03:08:40.640 --> 03:08:45.640]  kill baby good it's biblical what's good is bad is good it's incredibly racist it's and
[03:08:45.640 --> 03:08:50.480]  racist so what's not racist is racist but what is what is not racist is racist is racist
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:56.800]  there we are so and then following that what's really key is they talk about here when these
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:01.520]  products beontane tangerine ultimate classic are administered to healthy human colon cells
[03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:06.960]  there was no significant death of healthy human cells compared to cancerous colon cells
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:12.120]  ultimate classic killed ninety five percent of cancerous colon cells sixty five percent
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:16.280]  of cancerous liver cells sixty five percent of cancerous stomach cells and thirty percent
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:20.500]  of cancerous breasts and by the way wallach has sued over and over again whenever he does
[03:09:20.500 --> 03:09:26.120]  big studies or has studies done to prove and beaten the fda over and over we had the lawyer
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:30.160]  on last week you know top lawyer that's right the point is is that linus pauling already
[03:09:30.160 --> 03:09:34.060]  found all this stuff and got a nobel prize in what was it 62 or something i mean they
[03:09:34.060 --> 03:09:37.660]  already knew all this they just want people knowing this no they don't they don't want
[03:09:37.660 --> 03:09:42.380]  people knowing it so i think the battle to keep covering up this information will only
[03:09:42.380 --> 03:09:48.040]  intensify and these things that they throw to us that we're racist or we're that we're
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:53.880]  whatever we are anti-human they'll keep throwing that at us because we're getting the word
[03:09:53.880 --> 03:09:59.840]  out and alex jones is getting the truth out on his show so it is uh key here though that
[03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:05.200]  they really talk about how that beyonce and tangerine and ultimate classic are killing
[03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:10.320]  these cancer cells in these different organs and parts of the body so it's really an amazing
[03:10:10.320 --> 03:10:15.380]  yeah but that's not big i mean that's not important well uh i think maybe to the new
[03:10:15.380 --> 03:10:19.080]  world order it's probably not important they would love to cover that up but uh folks i
[03:10:19.080 --> 03:10:22.640]  can't tell you you know we don't talk about the business side of young jeopardy very often
