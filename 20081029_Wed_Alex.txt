[08:17.680 --> 08:30.400]  and now live from austin texas alex jones it is wednesday the 29th day
[08:32.960 --> 08:40.480]  of october 2008 we're going to be live here for the next three hours and 52 minutes steve
[08:40.480 --> 08:46.160]  watson joining us from london larry pratt joining us from washington dc richard cook
[08:46.160 --> 08:52.640]  and before i get into all the news here and it's very important seems like every week stuff just
[08:52.640 --> 09:00.160]  gets more intense um got a call from venturi yesterday missed the call got a call from
[09:01.120 --> 09:09.200]  senator dean barkley who was briefly appointed years ago um whenever senator wellstone died
[09:09.200 --> 09:15.280]  to the senate who is running there in a tight race i'd let us know uh that the listeners
[09:15.280 --> 09:21.040]  of this radio show pushed him over the edge they did not have the money for the tv ads
[09:22.560 --> 09:25.520]  franken and the other creature that he's running against
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.520]  raised over 30 million dollars between them and the dean barkley campaign
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.960]  is just right behind the two main contenders with only 50 000 dollars in the last few months
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.680]  raised because when venturi said he wasn't going to do it barkley jumped in guess how much the
[09:45.680 --> 09:52.000]  listeners of this show raised and 100 percent of it is going into the tv ads that start airing
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.240]  tomorrow right through to election day you raised 40 000 dollars and growing in one one
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.800]  hour interview and you're you're just the best people on the face of the earth and i really
[10:04.800 --> 10:13.440]  appreciate that and when loser draw we are fighting on every front in the media wars
[10:13.440 --> 10:16.960]  in the info war in the elections we're also fighting for election integrity
[10:19.040 --> 10:22.000]  we're fighting in the court for the bill of rights and constitution
[10:24.240 --> 10:28.240]  and i commend you so i know that venturum and barkley not even so much to
[10:29.280 --> 10:33.200]  ask for more donations but just to come on and thank you they're either going to be on
[10:33.200 --> 10:36.800]  the day or tomorrow because i've been playing phone tag with them and barkley's trying to
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.600]  nail down when ventura can come on with him but i'm going to do about 10 15 minutes on that and
[10:41.600 --> 10:44.880]  maybe keep in turn a little bit more with some i'm going to get into it i'm going to twist his
[10:44.880 --> 10:48.880]  arm to tell some of the stories he privately told us because it was just so entertaining and
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.800]  interesting i'm really sold on jessie ventura hanging out with him for two days
[10:54.800 --> 11:04.720]  he's he is the strongest personality i have ever been around i mean he is overpowering
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.440]  and he's not even trying to do it i mean he'll just talk your head off you know we could drive
[11:09.440 --> 11:16.480]  an hour out to willis place an hour back just ventura is just going a hundred miles an hour
[11:16.480 --> 11:23.520]  with the stories he was telling and the things he was going over
[11:26.320 --> 11:31.200]  i will tell you this uh no i won't tell you because you never know what's going to happen
[11:31.200 --> 11:39.520]  tv shows i'm just going to leave it for the future but a lot of interesting stuff going on
[11:39.520 --> 11:43.600]  i'll just leave it at that
[11:48.480 --> 11:53.360]  you know i it really hit me driving into work this morning just how
[11:55.760 --> 12:00.880]  wild and dangerous just how volatile
[12:00.880 --> 12:08.400]  the upheaval is that we're witnessing right now worldwide the i mean the markets continue to slide
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.640]  main street is his has had the cash supply the liquidity supply the credit supply cut off to
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.800]  it worldwide not just here in the us the international bankers are openly announcing
[12:18.800 --> 12:25.040]  their world government making their move some polls show barack obama six points ahead
[12:25.040 --> 12:32.960]  that's the highest poll most polls show a three to four point lead some polls show a
[12:33.520 --> 12:42.960]  one point lead which is a statistical dead heat and i've talked a lot about the science of polling
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.080]  people will tend to answer a poll at least a large portion of the public around 40 to what they
[12:48.080 --> 12:58.800]  think is politically correct and so when you hear barack obama's people and others say well
[12:58.800 --> 13:04.800]  we think there's a five to maybe even eight percentage points out there that are saying
[13:04.800 --> 13:08.880]  the pollsters they're going to vote for barack obama only because they think it's the politically
[13:08.880 --> 13:13.120]  correct thing to do because they don't want to be seen as racist now why would people
[13:13.120 --> 13:20.560]  feel like they had to lie to a pollster about not being for a particular candidate
[13:20.560 --> 13:30.960]  just because his father was african so that speaks more to guilt and basic cultural mind control
[13:32.800 --> 13:39.840]  than it does to racism and you know where i stand on racism racism is tribalism
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.440]  in africa most of the tribes hate the guys right across the river or right down the hill
[13:46.000 --> 13:52.400]  or over the mountain and they're black and if you study cultures all over the place and look
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.560]  at germania and gall before the romans took it over they were always killing each other
[13:57.760 --> 14:05.680]  they were white guys nordics germanics it's the same thing in asia it's humans behave the same
[14:05.680 --> 14:17.360]  we are the same and that's just the bottom line and it's tribalism and there is just amazing
[14:17.360 --> 14:23.280]  amounts of tribalism in and around both the candidates and that's what the parties are is
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.120]  the system manipulating tribalism where you've got this camp and the other camp and it's simulated
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.280]  warfare that's what football is you know one uniform is red and white and other uniforms
[14:33.280 --> 14:38.720]  blue and silver or one uniform is yellow and white and the other uniforms brown and white i mean
[14:38.720 --> 14:43.120]  whatever that's what those colors are about that's what standards and flags are about
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.640]  that's all about manipulating our primitive makeup
[14:51.120 --> 14:58.160]  and the new world order their people like us but they have understood the scientific
[14:58.160 --> 15:11.440]  systems the sociological the psychological the anthropological triggers to manipulate and control
[15:11.440 --> 15:20.640]  populations and to beat the new world order we have to start thinking the way they do about society
[15:22.080 --> 15:27.120]  but instead of keeping that knowledge secret and using it to control others we need to teach
[15:27.120 --> 15:32.320]  everyone about how humans really operate and about how we have primitive instinctive buttons
[15:32.320 --> 15:35.600]  and triggers that are being punched and levers that are being pulled
[15:41.200 --> 15:45.360]  i mean don't people want to know how the world really works how it really operates
[15:46.960 --> 15:50.560]  and the greatest trick the new world order ever had was convincing the population that didn't
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.600]  exist or that oh there's no complex societies there's no complex systems there's no ruling
[15:55.600 --> 16:01.360]  elites there's no organizational skills there's no subterfuge there's no influence paddling
[16:01.360 --> 16:08.320]  and elite organizations and oh powerful people don't want power and somehow they convinced the
[16:08.320 --> 16:17.440]  american people to go to sleep and to not care and to turn loose of their destiny and and and
[16:17.440 --> 16:24.000]  just let others control and now we're completely overrun by a scientific worldwide dictatorship
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.400]  that is mopping up the last pockets of national resistance bankrupting economies worldwide to
[16:30.400 --> 16:37.280]  even expand their power and control consolidate their control and now everything that we warned
[16:37.280 --> 16:41.200]  you about all the documents we brought forward all the guests we had on all the information
[16:41.200 --> 16:46.720]  that the liberty patriot truth movement freedom movement whatever you want to call it everything
[16:46.720 --> 17:01.200]  we brought out is now unfolding so that's the bottom line i don't even ask you to believe
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.000]  what i'm saying or what i'm stating i'm asking you to look into it for yourself and to stop
[17:06.000 --> 17:14.560]  being so trusting of the system and the establishment that's all i'm asking you to do because through
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.680]  that we can turn this around here's the news uh australia to enforce mandatory chinese style
[17:19.680 --> 17:26.880]  internet censorship prism planet dot com from paul watson and they have the official government
[17:32.800 --> 17:36.720]  internet provides the connections to the internet to over half the population of canada
[17:36.720 --> 17:47.040]  it's happening that's only one facet it's happening so we need to fight for an open
[17:47.040 --> 17:53.520]  and free internet but to do that we have to let the public understand it's being shut down as we
[17:53.520 --> 18:02.400]  speak here's another one carton immo info wars dot com microsoft patents censorship bought
[18:02.400 --> 18:06.640]  and the times of london also reports on it and it says it will go into the web
[18:11.440 --> 18:16.080]  and it will go into youtube it will go into when you're reading a website and it will
[18:17.280 --> 18:23.760]  with a program through your computer block out words block out phrases block out information
[18:23.760 --> 18:31.680]  this is a huge filter they put in the hubs and also in the computers and they admit in both these
[18:31.680 --> 18:38.240]  articles the info wars dot com article in the prism planet dot com article that has all the
[18:38.240 --> 18:44.320]  mainstream news quoted they admit this will slow the web down even more that's what they're going
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.920]  to do they're going to throw all these filters and taxes and regulations and controls that slow
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.520]  down the entire web basically ends that neutrality by itself but then having open and quote free
[18:55.520 --> 19:01.280]  superfast on internet too but they do that by restricting who can have a website or who can
[19:01.280 --> 19:08.080]  post content you have to register or be on a subdomain to be on internet too so we have that
[19:11.440 --> 19:17.280]  we have all over the country now random mag searches on trains first it was for terrorism
[19:17.280 --> 19:26.000]  now they say it's to fight crime this is the type of um type of stuff we're dealing with i mean
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.240]  uh we'll come back and go over all of it stay with us a day unlike any other in the long
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.160]  course of american history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemies struck america

[24:00.000 --> 24:04.480]  the fluoride they're adding a sodium fluoride into that guys they're actually adding a whole string
[24:04.480 --> 24:14.000]  of deadly chemicals we've had toxicologists on from the EPA thousands of EPA scientists
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.880]  a few years ago signed open letters to the environmental protection agency asking them to
[24:20.880 --> 24:27.520]  take the fluoride out but the system said no and because the public is trying to avoid it
[24:28.320 --> 24:34.320]  and they say that they are now force medicating the deadly poison the chemical weapon into
[24:34.320 --> 24:44.480]  children's milk ice cream children's ice cream people can make jokes about that in movies in
[24:44.480 --> 24:51.360]  hollywood but the results are the zombified mindless population the sluggish population

[24:56.480 --> 25:03.920]  then larry pratt the head of gun owners of america to give you the real record
[25:04.480 --> 25:11.040]  of barack h obama on the second amendment versus john mccain and he is a gun grabber par excellence
[25:11.040 --> 25:16.800]  but i've got mainstream reports here now publishing findings that we've already
[25:17.840 --> 25:21.760]  had but now it's finally becoming a campaign issue a little too late
[25:21.760 --> 25:28.160]  that uh obama says he is coming for the guns god help us
[25:31.200 --> 25:37.440]  i don't think you're going to be getting them pal i mean this this system is so out of control
[25:38.640 --> 25:44.640]  and yeah we're probably going to have jesse ventura popping in again today talking about the
[25:44.640 --> 25:50.880]  campaign and thanking you for the incredible support that you gave uh dean barkley up there
[25:50.880 --> 25:57.280]  running for senate listeners of this show in one day 40 000 plus dollars came in allowing them to
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.120]  make the tv ad purchases because you have to have a minimum amount to even basically get ads statewide
[26:03.120 --> 26:12.000]  on tv and you did it imagine the two they're running against the republican democrat he's
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.600]  running against have 30 plus million they've spent and barkley is just right behind him in the polls
[26:19.600 --> 26:24.880]  with 37 decided just like ventura was in the late 90s when he won the governorship and this was his
[26:24.880 --> 26:32.800]  campaign manager then dean barkley so that is exciting there we might actually get a good
[26:32.800 --> 26:38.400]  senator in there thanks to all of you chipping in a little bit many hands make light work and we
[26:38.400 --> 26:51.600]  are really excited about that later i want to get into this washington post story metro to
[26:51.600 --> 26:58.560]  randomly search writers bags they have a poll do you support random bag searches in the metro
[26:58.560 --> 27:09.120]  system to combat crime and when i took the poll a few hours ago 60 plus percent said no
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.680]  and then others had no opinion and then another percentage of it was 20 something i don't remember
[27:13.680 --> 27:18.400]  you go pull it up if you want uh were for it but but look at how they phrase the question
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.760]  do you support random bag searches in the metro system to combat crime
[27:23.760 --> 27:31.360]  and all over the country in houston with the bus system and in dc with the buses and the trains
[27:31.360 --> 27:38.960]  the uh subways and in new york and now in la they have federal teams they have state teams local

[35:15.520 --> 35:23.920]  sheffield uh i mean this is going on across the country this is just uh focusing in on us on one
[35:23.920 --> 35:30.960]  city alone 42 schools in that city according to this report in the yorkshire post under a new
[35:30.960 --> 35:37.520]  strategy with the focus of preventing dental problems which of course as we've covered many
[35:37.520 --> 35:46.800]  times um dental experts the dental association have all given warnings about excessive intake
[35:46.800 --> 35:56.400]  of fluoride having negative health effects with very little positive effects um according to
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.280]  this report it's under a new contract to encourage encourage dental workers to carry out more
[36:03.280 --> 36:10.480]  preventive work added in there is the provision that fluoride has already been added to 42 to milk
[36:10.480 --> 36:16.800]  children's milk in 42 primary schools in the city which will continue on the local nhs
[36:16.800 --> 36:25.760]  uh is also planning to be in talks on adding more fluoride to water throughout the city
[36:27.360 --> 36:33.040]  continue steve okay it says the key changes will come into force in march next year
[36:34.080 --> 36:39.600]  uh when the current contract comes to an end direct of public health sheffield jongrene
[36:39.600 --> 36:47.680]  said the current dental contract was very actively focused um but they want it to they want to
[36:48.720 --> 36:52.960]  obviously they want to carry out more of this kind of thing and if we look into
[36:54.960 --> 37:05.280]  what dentists have to say about fluoridation of water and milk um july 2007 review
[37:05.280 --> 37:12.080]  studies by the american dental association concluded that children under six are at
[37:12.080 --> 37:19.840]  risk of permanently discolored teeth due to fluoride supplements which are uh given to
[37:19.840 --> 37:29.120]  children if they if they don't have fluoridated water in their area um what happens is excessive
[37:29.120 --> 37:37.840]  fluoride causes enamel fluorosis of the teeth which is significant discoloration and it's
[37:38.720 --> 37:47.040]  specifically uh as a specific specifically bad effect on young children as their teeth are
[37:47.040 --> 37:58.000]  developing uh other dentists have spoken out uh for example dr hardy lineback head of preventive
[37:58.000 --> 38:05.920]  dentistry at the university of toronto said that mass medicating the public through the water supply
[38:05.920 --> 38:14.320]  was dangerous and unnecessary i said the benefits are exaggerated the growing evidence of overexposure
[38:14.320 --> 38:21.760]  from fluoridated toothpaste and many other sources because it's not only in water and toothpaste
[38:21.760 --> 38:29.440]  and as we've seen now in milk it's it's been put into all kinds of things like tea food
[38:30.720 --> 38:38.320]  um anyway in a in an email to mclean the toothpaste manufacturer this doctor wrote quote
[38:38.320 --> 38:44.800]  on the risk side so many people will end up with ruined teeth fragile bones acute sensitivities
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.360]  thyroid problems and increased risk for cancer all in the name of preventive dentistry now let's
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.520]  stop right there we're going to keep going through the article with steve wantson this is another
[38:55.520 --> 39:02.880]  prime example of hidden in plain view they knew in the 20s that sodium fluoride was a deadly chemical
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.960]  weapon uh that had a cognitive effect that uh fractured the bones the teeth that attacked every
[39:08.960 --> 39:15.200]  organ in the body particularly glands calcified them thousands of studies by the 50s they took
[39:15.200 --> 39:21.440]  the toxic waste but use the term fluoride as a whole subgroup of over a hundred deadly chemicals
[39:22.560 --> 39:29.440]  lead mercury arsenic um just on and on and on that they dump in your water now
[39:30.480 --> 39:36.240]  because the public is now filtering water and because the public instinctively knows that
[39:36.240 --> 39:41.680]  the and plus it tastes horrible i mean folks this is not placebo or imaginary when i was a child
[39:41.680 --> 39:46.960]  i would brush my teeth and my dad was a dentist and i was you know and i was really into brushing
[39:46.960 --> 39:50.800]  my teeth right now i always remember i'd feel great and then i'd brush my teeth and i have to
[39:50.800 --> 39:58.240]  go lay on the couch i have a horrible headache and i remember uh by the time i was like 10 i
[39:58.240 --> 40:05.280]  started figuring out every time i brush my teeth i just feel horrible i just feel terrible and i
[40:05.280 --> 40:10.560]  feel exhausted and i and i and i and it makes me feel nauseous and so i started learning to only
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.200]  use a little bit of toothpaste and and and it wasn't as bad and then dallas water tasted like
[40:15.200 --> 40:22.160]  kerosene and then the first few times i would go to a business and see sparklets or whatever
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.680]  or zarka i would like man what is this it tastes so good i mean i for the first time in my life
[40:27.680 --> 40:33.920]  i was drinking real water so see the globalist or masters just like if they want to sterilize a herd
[40:33.920 --> 40:40.000]  of deer or wild pigs that's how they're controlling some of them now in texas they will go to a water
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.560]  supply and and and put a chemical in it to sterilize them or they'll put out pellets to
[40:44.560 --> 40:51.040]  sterilize them that they eat uh it's the same thing they put it out into our environment like
[40:51.040 --> 40:56.000]  we're animals they're the anthropologists they're the behavioral psychologists uh they study us
[40:56.000 --> 41:03.440]  like animals you know like a scientist studies uh microbes in a petri dish and they are cold
[41:03.440 --> 41:07.360]  bloodedly doing this so now that we're avoiding it they have the government's coming out saying well
[41:07.360 --> 41:10.880]  the public's avoiding it we'll just put it in fruits and vegetables we'll just put it in
[41:10.880 --> 41:14.800]  processed foods we'll put it in the milk and of course this is only the tip of the iceberg
[41:14.800 --> 41:20.240]  they're putting it in milk here uh they'll have orange juice now this is fortified by nutrients
[41:20.240 --> 41:24.800]  and minerals you'll read on the back it'll say fluoride it'll say fluoride for kids give your
[41:24.800 --> 41:31.040]  kids what they need but there's been a revolution a revolution of resistance against this tyranny we
[41:31.040 --> 41:38.880]  have the dentist we have the epa scientist we have the majority of them uh you know thousands
[41:38.880 --> 41:43.600]  of them a few years ago signed a letter to the epa this was their own scientist saying this is
[41:43.600 --> 41:49.120]  deadly this is horrible this is hot you know giving them all the proof and the epa said no
[41:49.120 --> 41:52.080]  we're still gonna do it it's still gonna try to force states and counties and cities and
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.640]  water districts do it so the point is there is a revolution where scientists finally looked at
[41:56.640 --> 42:03.840]  this and said my god they knew all along yes this is who runs the west they're brain damaging you
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.640]  that you should be so you're being given a chemical lobotomy steve wantson yeah i mean
[42:10.640 --> 42:17.360]  maybe we should contextualize more about what fluoride actually is which i did at the end of
[42:17.360 --> 42:24.000]  the article i wrote um it's a waste the sodium fluoride that's put in water it's actually
[42:24.000 --> 42:33.360]  a waste product of the fertilizer and aluminium industry uh in the uk it's classed under the
[42:33.360 --> 42:40.880]  uk poisons act as a part two poison it's one of the most deadly poisons there are um it's
[42:41.840 --> 42:49.520]  it was used not only by the nazis to fluoridate water to dumb down people in concentration
[42:49.520 --> 42:58.160]  camp also by the soviets in the fifties it was used in their water supplies to make prisoners
[42:58.880 --> 43:03.040]  more docile and subservient um it's
[43:07.360 --> 43:17.520]  it's uh 97 percent of west europe has rejected it yet in america 60 percent of the population's
[43:17.520 --> 43:22.880]  water is now fluoridate by the way it's now about 75 the enemy they will come into a small town
[43:23.760 --> 43:29.600]  and spend you know by small town i saw an example in one texas town over 40 000 and they spent
[43:29.600 --> 43:36.160]  one million dollars to brainwash the public i mean because they love you they love your teeth
[43:36.160 --> 43:41.360]  this is like invasion of the body snatchers folks this is a big deal hey cops who love the system
[43:41.360 --> 43:47.600]  love the system people that work for the government fbi agents it's hurting you too you can't ignore
[43:47.600 --> 43:57.520]  the facts i'm sorry steve go ahead yeah i'm in germany access in germany belgium uh places like
[43:57.520 --> 44:03.440]  in europe it's fluoridation has been rejected because it's they they actually cast it as
[44:03.440 --> 44:10.880]  a violation of you know fundamental rights yet in america they're pushing towards as you said
[44:10.880 --> 44:17.280]  75 percent of population's water fluoridated let's explain that though again okay the government
[44:17.280 --> 44:20.640]  make you take valium can the government make you smoke marijuana can the government make you
[44:20.640 --> 44:24.800]  drink jack daniels can the government make you take prozac can the government make you take
[44:24.800 --> 44:30.160]  ritalin can the government make you take uh no well then why can they put a deadly poison
[44:31.040 --> 44:38.640]  in your water go ahead exactly what forced medication and this is why stories like
[44:38.640 --> 44:45.760]  the one we've highlighted here where it's been put into children's milk make it so insidious
[44:45.760 --> 44:55.840]  because the the chemical specifically affects development so any effect is going to have on
[44:55.840 --> 45:01.760]  is going to be amplified that's right it causes leukemia it causes a bunch of different types
[45:01.760 --> 45:08.800]  of uh bone cancers and don't don't laugh cops you got a son it's even worse than boys it's double
[45:08.800 --> 45:16.000]  the kill effect on boys it is girls google fluoride bone cancer do not laugh hundreds of
[45:16.000 --> 45:21.120]  mainstream scientific reports go ahead steve yeah i mean i highlighted some of them in the
[45:21.120 --> 45:29.520]  article the bone cancer one was a 2005 this is one of them certainly 2005 study conducted at
[45:29.520 --> 45:36.560]  harvard dental health school which found that fluoride in tap water directly contributed to
[45:36.560 --> 45:44.000]  bone cancer in specifically in young boys uh there's a link to a london observer article
[45:44.000 --> 45:50.240]  from 2005 which says the new american research suggests that boys exposed to fluoride between
[45:50.240 --> 45:58.320]  the ages of five and ten will suffer an increased rate of osteostar coma bone cancer between the
[45:58.320 --> 46:05.360]  ages later on between the ages of 10 and 19 and that's just one study there's another study folks
[46:05.360 --> 46:09.360]  you can love me or hate me and love steve or hating but listen to me your family and your
[46:09.360 --> 46:16.160]  health is worth it do not roll your eyes start getting truly filtered water that means reverse
[46:16.160 --> 46:22.000]  osmosis or the atmosphere machines uh or the gravity filters uh but then that only gets at
[46:22.000 --> 46:28.400]  about 95 percent but it at least reduces it a lot uh you know you need to do distilled listen to me
[46:28.400 --> 46:33.200]  listen to me just because you've done this your whole life doesn't mean you've got to keep doing
[46:33.200 --> 46:41.840]  it please we've seen the statistics it's worse than smoking go ahead and it's not just in water
[46:41.840 --> 46:51.040]  as we've as we said before it's also in foods and perhaps the most horrific example of what it's in
[46:51.040 --> 47:01.120]  is the baby formula it's uh the powder for babies it's being added to that and i was reading at
[47:01.120 --> 47:11.760]  levels of 0.04 to 0.47 milligrams per liter massive which um according to study is more it's more
[47:11.760 --> 47:18.160]  likely that children taking that amount are going to suffer dental problems so it completely
[47:18.160 --> 47:23.920]  no obliterates any well that's only on the surface see that the globalist hate it because it deforms
[47:23.920 --> 47:29.680]  and turns the the teeth into chalk and puts spots all over them with fluorosis and so just imagine
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.520]  if it's hurting the teeth what else it's doing and by the way that's at higher levels in the
[47:33.520 --> 47:39.280]  one part per million that is devastating you see with the children they soup it up to just wreck
[47:39.280 --> 47:43.520]  their brains they're just savagely it's like beating your kid in the head with a baseball bat
[47:43.520 --> 47:51.280]  but no 0.47 to put it into context 0.47 milligrams per liter in this baby powder
[47:52.560 --> 48:00.000]  the the national academies of science institute of medicine's food and nutrition board says that
[48:01.280 --> 48:07.520]  infants should not receive more than 0.01 milligrams per liter fluoride a day
[48:07.520 --> 48:16.240]  and in some baby formula it's going up to 0.4 and higher now again the the the the smaller
[48:16.240 --> 48:22.720]  amounts devastating but they want that they want that lobotomy and they want it now and then when
[48:22.720 --> 48:30.880]  you add when you actually mix the baby formula you have to add water and obviously that's got
[48:30.880 --> 48:38.560]  fluoride in it as well so it's just compounding it and February 2007 the american dental association
[48:39.520 --> 48:46.960]  warned that baby formula containing fluoride mixed with fluoride water is far too excessive and leads
[48:46.960 --> 48:55.840]  to enamel fluorosis and also the centers for disease control estimated that around 33 percent
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.320]  of children in america age 12 to 15 have got mild forms of fluorosis now yeah and they're also brain
[49:02.320 --> 49:09.440]  damaged zombies god they've devastated us can you think of a steve a more wicked plan a more wicked
[49:09.440 --> 49:16.560]  operation i mean it's just it's so cold-blooded to do this to children i think what else they're
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.680]  dealing to us ladies and gentlemen the gmo food all of it i mean we are in armageddon right now
[49:21.680 --> 49:28.960]  we are being devastated right now with military attacks this is military i mean there's a lot
[49:28.960 --> 49:37.040]  of propaganda to go along with it as well recently we paul wrote an article about a coloring book
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.880]  that was issued by the national institute of child health and human development a government
[49:44.880 --> 49:54.880]  agency which basically promoted fluoride toothpaste and used the the character that they called body
[49:54.880 --> 50:03.760]  brush to push the use of fluoride toothpaste you know despite the fact that all these studies
[50:03.760 --> 50:13.200]  are showing it linked to bone cancer etc liver kidney damage they are attacking your children

[55:06.400 --> 55:12.000]  we haven't talked about today that people should go and find out in this article i've written
[55:13.040 --> 55:20.480]  um the the other effects that it has such as you know lowering iq thyroid problems liver and
[55:22.320 --> 55:30.480]  kidney damage and and young children i mean it oh we got we've got we just got to keep trying to
[55:30.480 --> 55:38.960]  get the facts out and hope that you know the tide of information will become too great
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.080]  well there was any doubt steve watson of just how evil these global architects are these
[55:44.080 --> 55:52.080]  eugenicists look at it look at what they do just with this yeah i mean then you've got
[55:53.040 --> 55:56.480]  talking about the milk you've got all kinds of things in there
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.160]  there we've written about the bovine growth hormone which
[56:05.360 --> 56:14.000]  which uh you know also have been directly linked with cancer and that's been added into milk so
[56:16.400 --> 56:24.000]  it's just compounders i mean we wrote an article about uh the the article i mentioned before was
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.400]  the propaganda one with buddy brush i'd also encouraged at the same time as fluoride toothpaste
[56:30.400 --> 56:38.080]  the other thing it encouraged was uh milk drinking milk for children and that's actually the bovine
[56:38.080 --> 56:43.920]  growth hormone is actually i think it's banned by the EU but it's it's readily pumped into
[56:44.480 --> 56:49.920]  cows in america to make them you know keep producing milk all year round and that's going into the milk
[56:49.920 --> 56:57.600]  that's being drunken you know 49 states one-third of all cattle are injected with it and that's

[1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:28.400]  and they openly say it's the shutdown hateful ideology so youtube starting to censor they're
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:35.840]  censoring here all of this is happening steve yes too as they describe it it will it will
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:42.080]  uh it be a universal national filter they'll block websites deemed to be controversial
[1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:48.880]  part of the wider agenda to regulate the internet uh it's just a continuation of what we've seen
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:58.080]  in this country in america we've reported several times that you know uh federally funded
[1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:05.200]  uh depart science departments want to scrap the internet and start it again because it's too
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:12.240]  free for them they can't they can't uh track things well enough they can't they can't put
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:17.440]  restrictions on it so they want to scrap and start an internet too the same thing in europe
[1:02:17.440 --> 1:02:28.080]  and talk of licensing like television services of course if you if your content is deemed
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:33.120]  to be too controversial you won't be granted a license therefore you won't be able to have a
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:43.760]  website on the new internet we've seen new um wi-fi areas across the u.s outdoor wi-fi areas that
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.440]  contain strong filters that'll filter out political websites that are deemed to be offensive
[1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.880]  they're already doing it to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:02:52.880 --> 1:02:59.200]  yeah we've seen that in the uk and train stations public libraries hospitals anywhere public like
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:07.440]  that we've had stories of just our websites being filtered out but not just our websites
[1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:15.600]  i should say but others like even mildly political ones like think progress sites like that so
[1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:20.240]  to say that it's just going on in china is obviously blatantly
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:25.040]  false and they're incrementally doing this because you have a criminal world government
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:29.280]  that can't have the people exposing them tony blare before he left gave a speech saying we've
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:34.880]  got to shut down the web it's destroyed our capability to set up a new world order that's
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:39.760]  right so folks you better use it while you've still got it i mean we're talking about even
[1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:44.480]  maybe a few months in england and europe and australia i mean this is happening everywhere folks
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:48.720]  because we're hurting them badly right now the fact that we can post a video and
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:53.760]  in a month five million people conservatively can watch it you know in one of my films or other
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.400]  films tens of millions over six months you know a hundred million in a couple years i mean that's
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:06.720]  devastating them they've got to shut us down yeah bless that it was too feral too feral was the
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:10.880]  quote it's too wild and was destroying the trust in the government because the government's a
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:17.040]  pack of lying criminals steve watson info wars dot net thank you so much for joining us thanks a lot

[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:54.720]  america the second largest gun riot group in the country and really the the biggest because it's the
[1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:03.920]  only large real organization that we have larry pratt and he's here for the next 40 minutes or so
[1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:09.600]  to give us a detailed breakdown of barack obama's views on the second amendment his statements his
[1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:15.680]  record what the facts are versus john mccain now both men are vehemently anti self-defense
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:20.560]  vehemently anti second amendment both men are open border promoting new world order loving
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:27.360]  openly calling for it but barack obama has said and just things that go beyond john mccain and so
[1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:31.520]  we're just giving you the facts this should have been a much bigger election issue it hasn't been
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:38.240]  i knew obama was anti-gun but last month i really fared it out his actual quotes and video clips
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:45.440]  in his votes in illinois and in the u.s senate he is the most anti-gun candidate for president i
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.520]  believe i've ever seen larry pratt is that an accurate statement alas it is accurate uh
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:59.520]  we don't have a very exciting choice between those two candidates uh mccain has been
[1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:05.680]  well let's look at it this way when i was in school you get anything below a 60 as a rule
[1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:14.480]  sometimes it was 65 you got an f now mccain's f came at about a 25 percent so 25 percent of
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:20.160]  the time he did go right in but probably most significantly uh in the past he voted against
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:27.040]  the semi-autobahn the clinton gun ban uh but a lot of other things he's been very bad on and
[1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:33.360]  and a spokesman uh for the other side and so you can't you can't um take that away from the guy's
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:39.440]  record and that's why uh when he first came to congress we'd give him a cc minus we'd moved him
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:45.520]  down to an f uh frankly this year we've been willing to move him back to his c minus basically
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:51.680]  because he joined with almost a majority of the senate urging a vote on the dc measure which
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:59.360]  uprooted would have uprooted most of the dc gun control law that's still in the books after the
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.080]  supreme court ruling and there was a game being played there we can talk about that in a minute
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:11.120]  if you want uh not in the senate but in the house um and significantly chose sarah palin as a vice
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:18.240]  president somebody that uh amazed me because uh she's very much more conservative than as he
[1:10:18.240 --> 1:10:25.840]  and especially on guns she fired a police chief because he was opposing uh the now law on concealed
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:30.720]  carry in alaska which says you truly have a right to carry you want to put one in your purse
[1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:36.800]  or in your pocket then you just do it you don't need a permit vermont style vermont style and and
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:43.520]  in a way it's even more clever than vermont because if you want reciprocity and you want to travel
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:49.840]  to the lower uh 48 uh you can get a permit uh so that you would have that to show and have
[1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:55.760]  reciprocity in other states but when you're in alaska if you and i go to alaska put that piece
[1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:02.800]  in our uh piece of luggage get to the parking lot uh get it out put it in our purse or a pocket
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:06.880]  we're good to go that perfectly legal you know that's a key thing you just brought up
[1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:11.680]  folks that grew up in cities never grew up on farms or ranches or were never in the military
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:17.600]  they see tv shows where it's all based in new york and you get caught with a gun you go to jail
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:22.640]  so when a carpet cleaner's in your house in texas from new york or something
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:27.680]  they will call the cops on you they see a gun case because they think guns are illegal that's how
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:32.880]  ignorant a lot of the public are that's the same thing people don't know that you can check firearms
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:37.040]  in your luggage you just got to tell them and and i've told the public before and they got emails
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:44.080]  saying i'm a liar well i can assure you that you're absolutely on the money and if you go to the
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:51.360]  tsa website they'll even give you all the little nitty gritty regulations today they have this uh
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:58.560]  a uh interesting notion that you have to have the uh ammunition and there's only a certain
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:03.280]  amount and it has to be in in a factory type container either the original box or one of
[1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:09.520]  those plastic ones that some people might have and it can't be uh say in the carrying case
[1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:14.000]  that you might have the gun in i i guess the assumption is that the bullets are going to
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:21.760]  migrate from the box over into that magazine less uh firearm that you're carrying and somehow
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:27.120]  one of them is going to get into that chamber and sure enough it's going to go off so anyway
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:32.560]  given that you show them that the gun is empty and you're good to go and i i can tell you that
[1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:38.320]  every airline i've had any experience with it used to be you you'd kind of hear them gasp when
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.480]  you you know right after that you had to start doing because for a long time you didn't even
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.640]  have to declare the gun you're supposed to have it unloaded which makes sense because
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.760]  if they're throwing it around like this is all part of of of restricting the second amendment
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:56.560]  teaching the public it's taboo it's illegal it's like a porno shop or something you got to put
[1:12:56.560 --> 1:13:01.280]  it in a black bag no this is our second amendment and you're not going to use peer pressure and
[1:13:01.280 --> 1:13:06.480]  mind control and political correctness uh to to to engineers out of it but i don't want to spend
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:10.160]  all day on that larry i'm sorry i well as you digress let's get in the walk of obama i'm glad
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:16.400]  you did because educating people on exercising a right is an important thing if we don't exercise it
[1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.640]  surely we will lose it well that's like police everywhere now saying you don't have a right to
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:24.960]  march or protest or even hand out flyers right and you know they're losing lawsuits everywhere
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:28.800]  and they're having to back off so people keep exercising and don't let them have a chilling
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:34.640]  effect but let's get into barack obama's real one more one more thing on on um um mrs palan because
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:40.720]  i think she is the real deal certainly on guns uh of talk show hope stuff there's a real friend
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:46.800]  of gun owners of america michael dukes um has had the governor on a number of times and had their
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:51.920]  schedules not changed for some reason uh they were planning to go machine gun shooting this fall
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:58.480]  and he called her one time with oh several months ago before she was uh gleam and mckay
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:04.320]  died and um he said look we've got some dealers up here that live outside the incorporated area fair
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:10.480]  banks uh so the state police have jurisdiction on signing off on machine gun transfers and they
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:17.600]  can't even get these guys to sign off on uh one a dealer selling a gun to another dealer
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:23.120]  and so she said oh i'll get right on it we'll get back to you uh two days later uh the public
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:28.640]  safety commissioner called him and said you should have no more problems from here on out so she
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:35.120]  really is pro gun she really is pro gun she doesn't just shoot animals i mean kerry went hunting uh
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:40.320]  so-called um four years ago and so that was the point of my discussion with dukes i said okay so
[1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:46.480]  kerry goes hunting i've seen her with a dead caribou um fine uh what is she really like on
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:53.280]  the gun issue and there's no question she uh has well actually she's demonstrated executive
[1:14:53.280 --> 1:15:00.240]  experience the very thing she said uh to not have in their dreams if this lady ever became president
[1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.040]  i got a shortlist for that i could have her work on here in town uh because she seemed to
[1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:10.880]  do a pretty good job up in in june oh anyway okay so that's where mckay is uh he you know he's a
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:17.280]  gun grabber but but uh you know to see yeah minus instead of an f now let's get into barack obama
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:23.680]  barack obama has been unrelenting now some of his rhetoric has been tricky but you know he's uh
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:28.160]  it's like drilling well we'll we'll take a look at it well sure you'll take a look at it
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:34.320]  but he's not even willing to commit on that on the the second amendment uh being a protecting
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:40.800]  an individual right he said oh uh i think the dc gun ban is just fine after the decision he said
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.320]  he agreed with it but you see what he's looking at is the fact that the decision was narrow there's
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:51.280]  plenty of areas where they can stick it to us now i think the decision is covered i mean we're
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:56.320]  reading it you're the expert you guys had a brief in the court i mean in a way it says it's right
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:00.960]  then it says but we can kind of restrict it and do this this and that so it really opens the door
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:07.440]  well there was some dicta which is not in the ruling itself which was troubling i won't argue with that
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:14.080]  but judges source dicta in there in their rulings yes it all it all adds up you're right but the
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:19.520]  fact is that on the two things that were actually before the court they ruled right and they ruled
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:25.520]  from the constitution and its language and they didn't set up one of these phony judicial standards
[1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:30.560]  of review let's not forget barack obama's weird statement about these scared people clutching
[1:16:30.560 --> 1:16:36.640]  their guns well actually we have a t-shirt that we've been selling right well it says on the
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:41.280]  back i'm a bitter clinger and it's got a couple of hands one grabbing a clinging if you will
[1:16:41.280 --> 1:16:50.560]  of a holy bible and the other clinging a 45 handgun and i love it so uh i'm sure you've
[1:16:50.560 --> 1:16:55.280]  mentioned that obama unawares that he was being recorded made that statement to some
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:17:00.640]  ultra liberal fat cats insane you know all those ultra liberal fat cats cling on to their body
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:05.920]  guards and their guns and obama sure loves the secret service with their guns but he does
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:10.160]  none of those folks cling on to the bible so i guess they're there we have a parting of the
[1:17:10.160 --> 1:17:16.240]  ways right away and of course they don't want us clinging the guns because that's uh that's
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:21.760]  really the difference people like us can't be trusted with guns only they and their
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:26.560]  hired bodyguards only the reeducators young only the reeducators they're the only ones
[1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:34.880]  that have it right so in the state senate obama had an opportunity to show where he really is
[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:40.400]  there was a guy by the name of hailey demar lives in will met which is a little suburb
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:45.920]  right across the street from chicago you can't hardly tell you're leaving and
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:52.560]  wanting to go into the other suburb definitely a suburb had a gun ban until after the supreme
[1:17:52.560 --> 1:17:56.960]  court decision and then they dropped their ban because they didn't want the expense of litigating
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:01.760]  because they were going to be sued because it was identical in principle in functioning
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:09.440]  to the dc and chicago a gun ban a licensing scheme that said you can have a gun but not really and
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:15.440]  so they dropped it but while they had it uh this restaurant owner living in a nice neighborhood
[1:18:15.440 --> 1:18:22.320]  not exactly a gangbanger um had a gun where the registration had expired so that made the gun
[1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:30.000]  illegal uh it was a non-registered gun the whole horror and two nights in a row his home was invaded
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.360]  the first night the guy was in and out got the keys to his suv and and stole that the next
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:42.080]  night the guy commutes now in the stolen suv and he's deep inside the house demar gets his gun out
[1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:47.600]  of his safe which is a heck of a place to keep yourself defense gun and shot the guy a couple
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:54.240]  of times they wanted to put demar in jail because he had violated the gun law that's just like
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:58.960]  england where the guy's been robbed three times and shoots one and then the robber sues him for
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:03.360]  shooting him in the butt with with with shotgun pellets absolutely the guy went to prison yes
[1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:09.680]  walter martin was the guy's name they put him in for life he's now out he's homeless because the
[1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:16.160]  police can't protect him so he can't go back to his house it's unbelievable they love disarming

[1:24:54.240 --> 1:25:02.160]  starve us out and you can't make us run because you can't starve about and you can't make us run
[1:25:06.080 --> 1:25:15.680]  let's go back to larry pratt larry continuing with baron co obama the hard core anti-gun commissar
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.320]  well just to wrap up what we had been talking about before the break obama thought that this
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:26.080]  homeowner who defended his family against a home invader should go to jail and the happily the
[1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:34.000]  legislature said no and they passed a law which exempted anybody using an illegal gun as long
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:40.080]  as it had been used in self-defense and so finally hallie demar was able to walk free
[1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:48.560]  another measure that obama supported was no gun stores within five miles of a school now he didn't
[1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:55.440]  have that concern about porn shops just gun stores and if you get your little high school compass
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:02.160]  out and draw a circle on a map that's everywhere it's everywhere even in rural areas you know maybe
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:06.880]  you'll have a store at the top of pike's peak or something but it's going to be pretty hard stores
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.520]  are always near the center of town and so are the schools well that's kind of where the people are
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:18.320]  and customers for both so funny thing that so yeah one of the things that's really chilled me
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:24.720]  is the i've dug into some of the work that drum course he has done the journalist that went
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:31.120]  over to kenya wrote a book about obama called obama nation you say it fast it comes out
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:39.760]  abomination um he has i think proven beyond any shadow of a doubt he's got copies of email from
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:50.480]  um obama senate office to the guy a marxist muslim thug who ran for president was defeated at the end
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:58.080]  of last year and it comes from the same tribe that obama's daddy does the luo tribe they're a
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.120]  minority so it's not too surprising that he lost the election uh it kind of has been working that
[1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:10.880]  way for since independence and the the the plan that obama was in on developing for the whole
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:16.960]  campaign he went over campaign for the guy in 06 on your nickel and on mine it was a senate fact
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:23.600]  finding trip uh well actually it was a campaign trip and we've got the pictures of the guy campaigning
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:30.480]  with this guy rally odinga odinga by the way was educated in east germany so his daddy was
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:38.400]  pretty red too and he named his oldest son fidel castro odinga so uh you know just when you start
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:43.680]  looking at the surface of the thing you begin to think hmm i don't think he's like most of us
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:49.920]  well he's not uh he signed a deal with the radical muslims that if he were to win he would put the
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:55.520]  whole country under sharia law you know like honor killing your daughter who doesn't do what you want
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:02.320]  that's okay um and that would have been imposed on the whole country within a year and the election
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:09.280]  plan that obama developed with um odinga and again they've got the correspondence between the the
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:15.360]  senate office and odinga campaign and the correspondence was bootlegged out by defectors
[1:28:15.360 --> 1:28:20.800]  from the campaign when they saw what actually happened in the plan there was provision that if
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:28.240]  we lose like when we lose uh we will provoke violence and they absolutely put those words down
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:36.160]  through provoking rape class war which actually over there means uh tribal black on black black
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:41.200]  on black the luo the same thing like racism here in fact i mean that's how tribalism is they hate
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:46.000]  each other even more than any race stuff we've got over here it's quite colorblind uh but it's
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:51.040]  hatred all the same and it's quite lethal uh because the majority cuckoo you who are largely
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:56.400]  christian like the luo or majority muslim thousand of them were murdered in a pogrom
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:02.880]  brought about by the obama odinga plan stay there and again folks this is all documented
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:08.320]  we're just covering the facts here uh think about the magnitude the obama campaign working on how to
[1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:15.200]  stir up violence against christians these people are terrorists his mother his father they're all
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:21.120]  admitted marxist linus i mean we are in a lot of trouble folks larry pratt stay with us
[1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:29.200]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:38.000]  i had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here recently and
[1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.160]  she was talking about the great depression and we were talking about the gas prices the food prices
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.480]  this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where
[1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:50.480]  we're headed or where we might end up and she was reminded of the great depression and how in those
[1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:54.240]  days folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could
[1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:58.480]  grow gardens and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:02.320]  the cities because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how they didn't have the
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:06.480]  chickens in the livestock so it's a lot different for them well we know one thing's certain right
[1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:11.040]  now we're headed into much higher prices on food and there is a global food shortage now what can

[1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:59.440]  because he's for all of it i would love to vote for a black man who was like ron paul but we can't
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:04.320]  do that no the first black guy they give us in the corporate run is somebody they can destroy

[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:25.440]  pimp continuing with larry pratt gunners of america as we break down the real barack obama
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:31.200]  please continue okay well before the break we were talking about the plan that obama had worked out
[1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:36.960]  with this guy reyla odinga odinga claims to be his cousin which is at least possible because
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:43.680]  they're both from the same region the same tribe the important thing is that they seem to have not
[1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:51.360]  only the same tribal connections but they're both marxists and they both have had at least some exposure
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:59.680]  to islam how much so is perhaps still being debated but the key thing is they they both
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:05.840]  could have been happy doing the chant that i heard when i was a student which dates me this is back
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:12.560]  in the sixties uh... that uh... the anti-western radicals who now control our universities were
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:21.120]  chanting ho ho ho western civs gotta go well they're just about at the point where they can pull off
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:28.960]  the chant it's no longer a a chant or a bumper sticker and so you've got a real deeply immersed
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:37.680]  in hatred of western civilization sort of guy in obama working with ditto in kenya and they went
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:43.520]  all through oh seven of the campaign unfolded december election uh... not surprisingly uh...
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:50.960]  because the minority party odinga lost january and february of this year were the two months of
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:57.520]  horrible violence over a thousand christians murdered no muslims were murdered uh... there were
[1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:03.040]  uh... over eight hundred churches burned to the ground one of them had thirty christians locked
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:09.600]  inside uh... from the outside uh... that was burned down uh... and tens of thousands had
[1:36:09.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  to flee their homes total disruption finally the majority uh... uh... president kibaki uh...
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:23.840]  who's a kakuyu of the majority tribe buckled and he said okay we'll invent native quite put this
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:29.920]  way we'll invent a new position in government called prime minister and ended up a power sharing
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:36.160]  arrangement being worked out uh... now when coursey went over to get this documentation
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.160]  that a lot of what i'm saying is based on although you can find on the internet the campaign plan
[1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:47.440]  you can find on the internet from the nationals uh... kenyan association of evangelicals the
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:54.160]  agreement that were uh... odinga signed with the muslim uh... shakes to put the country under
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.920]  islamic law that so some of the key points uh... that we're not making this stuff up
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:06.160]  it's out there for anybody to go find and and look at and i've got it all uh... in my files
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:13.360]  you can betcha uh... so they they gave this guy the prime minister ship and a number of
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:18.720]  portfolios in the government when course he went over he was on his way back he he was going to go
[1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:25.200]  to a hotel have a news conference and expose odinga for what he was and how he'd been working with
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:32.480]  obama and he was arrested by the immigration police well at that point i knew without knowing
[1:37:32.480 --> 1:37:39.280]  what portfolios had been given to odinga that he controlled those police and sure enough about
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:44.480]  three days later digging some more into this thing that was one of the portfolios he had been given
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:49.600]  so odinga just grabbed this guy course he fifteen minutes away from a news conference
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:53.840]  and detained him for the whole day and then finally right you know they ran him out of the
[1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:59.040]  country but he came out with the goods that he probably only got out because he was able
[1:37:59.040 --> 1:38:02.960]  before they realized what he was doing he was able to text message on his telephone
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:09.360]  phone uh... to joseph farah world met daily he put it up on his website which is visited probably
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:16.160]  almost as much as drudge uh... that got uh... farah onto uh... fox also got him on the uh...
[1:38:16.160 --> 1:38:21.120]  cnn international and at that point they realized they had a bit of an incident and that's when
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:25.920]  they let him go let's go over this we also gave the phone number out right after he got grabbed
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:30.080]  excellent here on the show to the embassies uh... but let's break this down here
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:32.320]  here
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:36.320]  his mother's an admitted communist his father's an admitted communist he's around
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:42.720]  admitted bombers that bombed police blew their faces off a lot of them and the man in hawaii
[1:38:42.720 --> 1:38:49.120]  that raised him a kind of disciple them bit better word franklin marshall davis uh...
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:54.000]  was an open communist i mean nobody that's what i mean there's no one that isn't a commie
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:59.280]  right i mean people have all commies going to get us the guy is open redistribute the wealth
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:04.240]  exactly what the bankers wanted to be seen that the portable commies on the ground understand
[1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:09.200]  it's what he told you that it never gets transferred to you it always goes to the
[1:39:09.200 --> 1:39:13.760]  international bankers yeah there's a handling fee that's uh... a bit excessive
[1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:19.040]  yeah ninety percent of it and then all you get black uniforms and cameras and checkpoints and
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:22.720]  and now he's going to have all this left cover now
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:26.080]  i know there's no election fraud i know both parties are bought and paid for the new world
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:29.360]  order the new order just plays different sides off against us
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:34.080]  uh... i did but i mean this barack obama stuff who could make it up all good
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:38.480]  anti-gun stuff in the communism in the bombers and the criminals in the
[1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:43.440]  mobsters and the i mean that this is a see why he wants gun control because
[1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:47.760]  he knows that there will be opposition and and let's go back to you obviously talked
[1:39:47.760 --> 1:39:51.760]  about sololensky rules for radical this is what the guy taught
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:55.760]  uh... at the university of chicago he represented them as an attorney
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:59.120]  he gave him millions of bucks sololensky close buddies
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:03.760]  with barack obama and folks you can't make this up the larry has a copy of it
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:07.360]  break down i mean i have again another one of these guys tell him
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:12.480]  well uh... a linsky uh... it was a communist who saw that it would be more
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:15.440]  effective rather than charging the barricades with
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:19.600]  a couple of flintlocks better to just take the culture from the top down this
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:24.160]  is something that has been very effectively uh... put forth
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:27.920]  uh... by communists uh... in the senate and well in the twentieth century now
[1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:33.040]  twenty-first century and so a linsky wrote these rules for radicals to teach
[1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:37.120]  how to lie how to deceive he said stop looking like hippies dress like i do
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:40.640]  he looked like mister peepers you know uh... harmless little guy with his
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:46.080]  bespectacled face uh... and uh... that way you can infiltrate when obama
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:50.080]  briefly at a job uh... in new york city at a law firm
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.000]  he described himself as i felt like i was behind enemy lines well
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.800]  that's right out of solowlinski a linsky is
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.920]  lie to get whatever you want because if you've dedicated your book to
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:05.120]  to lucifer openly because lucifer figured out how to lie to get power
[1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:08.960]  then that's exactly what a linsky's all about let me stop you let's go back
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:11.920]  over that every time you really study lennon
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:16.400]  or you study stalling or you study these german leaders or you study the
[1:41:16.400 --> 1:41:18.960]  communist here and i've known him personally
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:22.320]  they'll be wearing big red pentagram shirts they'll be hail satan right in
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:25.440]  front of you then laughing you know and then the communist always call
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:29.360]  themselves anarchist they're into deception they're into layers
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  but when you get to the core they will tell you i worship lucifer
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:37.920]  this is a luciferian operation and they bunch of them dedicate their books to
[1:41:37.920 --> 1:41:41.040]  it but these theosophics society dedicates to that
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:44.960]  i mean just the you the public just can't get their mind around it explain
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:50.400]  it to them well what a linsky did was to get a bunch of disciples like bill
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:53.840]  layers who is still is a professor at the
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:57.840]  university of chicago in education yeah let's make this clear he can blow cops
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:01.120]  faces off they killed people hundreds of bombings
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.800]  associated with them uh... and then remember bill clinton let a bunch of
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:08.800]  them go you bet you with his part i mean they're not playing games folks
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:11.680]  they'll line your family up and gun you down in a minute
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:14.880]  they will when they have the opportunity they've been
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:18.960]  relatively transparent uh... apparently passive
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:21.840]  lately because they again rules for radicals
[1:42:21.840 --> 1:42:25.280]  there's another way to do it that's better than uh... getting yourself shot
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:27.840]  uh... way to you get the guns and then you do the shooting
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:31.200]  and so that's what the game has been and airs
[1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:35.360]  saw that if he was part of a culture cultural revolution
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:40.320]  from the top down uh... which is uh... something that was uh...
[1:42:40.320 --> 1:42:44.320]  probably first put forth by an italian communist gromchy
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.600]  in the last century uh... studied by uh... hillary clinton as well as
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:53.920]  sol alinsky then uh... you get to the point where
[1:42:53.920 --> 1:42:57.840]  you fool people into thinking that you're just a you know progressive
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:43:01.440]  social reformer and then when it's too late you got all the levers of power
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:06.000]  bang then you let them have it uh... that's what's underway airs has been
[1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:09.600]  transforming chicago and national education
[1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:14.400]  a la cuba the guy is an open communists he's even on occasion
[1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:18.640]  called himself a communist and the elite the big money is putting it all behind
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:22.800]  obama there's a good chance that they're gonna give them full power i mean all
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:26.080]  the experts have had on historians are saying the central government's gearing
[1:43:26.080 --> 1:43:30.320]  up for mass purges and they just hand the power to obama and they do it
[1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:35.440]  it uh... it could be an extraordinary shift to dictatorship
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:39.040]  in this country because obama has clearly showed by
[1:43:39.040 --> 1:43:45.920]  a lifelong attachment
[1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:49.840]  to either uh... palestinian terrorists or american
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:53.600]  terrorists communist violent people and all of them
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:58.640]  uh... rather exceptionally clever i would say look how far the guy's gotten
[1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:02.480]  uh... with uh... really a pretty thin resume but here's the deal that it
[1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.720]  doesn't matter what president is the last twenty years
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:08.160]  more power they're getting rid of posse common taught us the governor
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:10.480]  uh... as you know three months ago in illinois and we're going to use the
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:12.960]  national guard for door to our gun confiscation
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:16.720]  i mean it's really happening and so all these right wing neocons
[1:44:16.720 --> 1:44:20.080]  so i'll let bush do whatever he wants we kept telling him hey that power is
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:23.280]  going to get passed on to the democrats but you know that's going to get handed
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:27.920]  over here we go the question to ask uh... when our guy quote unquote is
[1:44:27.920 --> 1:44:32.240]  president is would you really want that power in hillary clinton's or now
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:35.200]  barack obama's hands and if the answer is
[1:44:35.200 --> 1:44:40.080]  well that'll never happen would you want it in those hands
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:44.400]  and that's what that was never asked that that well we we were just handing
[1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:48.800]  power over and uh... there it went so yeah that it's been a
[1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:53.360]  bipartisan ground war uh... preparation for
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:57.280]  this moment and uh... if uh... obama pulls it off
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:00.880]  you can let's here's a scenario that bothers me this that
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:04.560]  polls at the moment are tight let's say they're accurate with may or may not be
[1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:06.960]  true uh... if they were say
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:11.040]  uh... uh... the guy loses by a few points typically
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:14.720]  uh... even with reagan people would not tell the truth to pollsters
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:18.240]  and reagan first time out was supposed to lose by four five points
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:22.960]  one by ten uh... what if something like that were to happen in this election
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:26.800]  uh... i'll tell you look at kenya to find out what's going to happen in january
[1:45:26.800 --> 1:45:29.120]  in february in this country
[1:45:29.120 --> 1:45:33.280]  because it was the obama kick uh... office in twill office advising them on
[1:45:33.280 --> 1:45:36.960]  how to do this absolutely uh... they were aware of the plan they didn't
[1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.360]  disavow the plan the whole thing they uh... concurred with the plan
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:46.160]  and uh... this is right out of soloski frankly there's a reverse option uh...
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:51.280]  here as well the neocons could use the riots to bring in their own martial
[1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:53.760]  law if it's mccain that wins i mean
[1:45:53.760 --> 1:45:56.800]  we're between a rock and a hard place here we are between a rock in the
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:45:59.680]  hard place the one difference is that the
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:02.480]  the poor christians that the cuckoo you
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:08.080]  uh... in kenya uh... still carry on the tradition of british disarmament
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:12.160]  of the people well uh... they're trying to do that here
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:16.800]  but they ain't got there yet and gun sales are up by ten percent that any
[1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:19.120]  other rep the people are buying guns and ammo
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:23.120]  so you can't even find them someplace i want to tell you i had a call from uh...
[1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:28.320]  she's a conservative a nice jewish lady never wanted a gun she's retired
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:30.960]  living with her husband in a gated community
[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:34.960]  and she said i am scared to death if this guy wins she said uh...
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:40.080]  what kind of a gun should i get i've never had one before
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:44.160]  no all the liberals i know are finally breaking their conditioning and buying
[1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:48.640]  guns literally literally they finally get it you can't trust government
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:50.960]  whether it's republican or democrat we're in trouble
[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:55.280]  well uh... it will be a uh... glorious time for a period
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:46:59.760]  uh... for the gun stores uh... ammo's already been tight before this and it's
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:02.640]  going to probably get tighter and uh...
[1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:07.440]  uh... if somebody's uh... concerned as we are and they don't think they
[1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:12.560]  have enough then uh... i would say this is the time to go shopping and uh...
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:16.080]  for sure after tuesday if uh...
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:21.760]  obama's the guy uh... you know what's going to happen
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:24.960]  massive gun control and he loses rioting you think there's going to be
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:26.400]  riding the police do
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:29.760]  uh... a bunch of articles about that they're wisely preparing for it but of
[1:47:29.760 --> 1:47:30.560]  course
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:34.800]  uh... the police were prepared for writing by the time it hit
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:37.600]  uh... washington dc back in the late sixties
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:41.280]  and i lived out in the suburbs at that time and that's when it
[1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:45.120]  i finally connected dots i was still in graduate school
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:48.960]  and uh... they they said on the radio they were probably a little bit more
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:50.640]  candid than they are now
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:54.080]  well we're not sure that we can contain the rioting and it may go out such and
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:56.080]  such these uh... major arteries
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.960]  well golly i lived right off of one of those major arteries and i had
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:04.400]  i thought i don't know much about guns but i'll bet you a shotgun would be good
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.840]  for a mob coming on my house in my young family
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.480]  so that's i went into a gun store it was before the gun control act
[1:48:12.480 --> 1:48:15.920]  it was actually a sporting store and i am
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:19.200]  i bought a shotgun no questions asked no record kept
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:22.400]  uh... can you imagine that was still relatively at that point
[1:48:22.400 --> 1:48:25.840]  as far as guns a free country and they use the rioting to crack down on the
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:26.720]  citizens
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:29.200]  and take and try to restrict our second amendment
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:30.240]  um...
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:34.320]  those very same riots were used to uh... push through the gun control act of
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:38.560]  nineteen sixty eight remember the korean shopkeepers just a few
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:42.400]  less than a dozen of them held off thousands burning and pillaging
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:45.920]  when the police stood down and that's why the second amendment so important and
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:47.200]  those were uh...
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:50.640]  oozy semi-automatics uh... with nice long
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:52.800]  nasty looking magazines then
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:56.640]  and it was just the intimidation factor uh... of the thugs
[1:48:56.640 --> 1:49:00.480]  seeing what was waiting for them and it was true it was dramatic
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:03.760]  uh... the thugs would burn even a building right next
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:06.080]  to the court the one the koreans were
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:09.680]  guarding uh... but the ones the koreans were guarding
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:13.440]  were unscathed magic
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:17.360]  well i tell you folks come right into my neighborhood i'm not that i am about
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:19.920]  pointing out somebody pull the trigger i'm not just gonna
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:23.760]  you know shooting the air and that's the i mean i'd
[1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:28.080]  i can't imagine i mean it's not going to be when you're in a hk-91 is going to
[1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.280]  really give them a problem when you're in a self-defense situation
[1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:34.640]  firing a warning shot could be very dangerous to you
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:39.120]  because that may be the last thing you ever do they may turn right on you and
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:43.520]  and shoot you so you know if you have a chance to kill the snake you take the
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:46.400]  first chance you get
[1:49:46.400 --> 1:49:49.440]  well that's a solidly weapon running around burning stuff
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:54.960]  uh... it definitely is and uh... you're in the right state you've got a very good
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:58.160]  uh... law for protecting your castle
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:01.840]  and uh... if you were to be anywhere on your property
[1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.920]  when such a scenario might unfold uh... i don't really think there'd be any
[1:50:05.920 --> 1:50:08.720]  questions asked they know that no jury in texas would
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:11.680]  come down well that's why if things burn it's going to be in the cities where

[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:31.200]  inner city black kids a couple of them were mentally retarded on government subsidies
[2:02:31.760 --> 2:02:34.880]  and remember they were going to destroy everything in miami and take over everything and
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.040]  and it turned out it was all just provocateur nothing they couldn't even basically brush their
[2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:42.640]  teeth yeah they were basically not even gonna do it they were just trying to rip off the fbi
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:45.680]  agent for his money they're like yeah we're gonna do that we're gonna do that and they took his
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:49.760]  money and you know they had no intention that was over a year yeah yeah and see they got they
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:53.280]  got exonerated i think they tried to get them twice and they couldn't make meanwhile we have
[2:02:53.280 --> 2:02:58.640]  obama with all these real terrorists around him and it's like oh no oh he's good the canes all
[2:02:58.640 --> 2:03:04.320]  mobbed up and keating five and no presents these are yesterday was a weird show on them because
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:08.480]  you had tarpley on i was driving around taking my kids to the park and stuff listening and you were
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.040]  on there talking about one hour it's you know obama's total devil and then the next hour with
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:17.600]  mcgover and it seems to be an angel cake and yeah and i like both guys but i mean it was just over
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:23.200]  the top i just kept promoting third party i'm like chuck baldwin synthia mckinney even ralph nader
[2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:26.640]  you know i'm like those are all better choices than these two and they're like no we have to
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:33.280]  stop it nothing to stop mccain and the neocons and no we have to stop it nothing to stop obama
[2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:38.800]  and the uh what was he calling them not all the fascists but i still i you know he were all
[2:03:38.800 --> 2:03:42.960]  bought and paid for by the same exactly like one caller finally called in and he really made the
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:47.680]  connections between bush and the cia in the late seventies into the drug running in the early eighties
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:50.880]  while he was vice president into running them through me to arkansas with the clinton's
[2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:54.800]  that's where they were really recruited and brought in the clinton's president for eight years and then
[2:03:54.800 --> 2:03:59.200]  bush and how it's all controlled at the top and tarpley just brushes that off oh no this is a new
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:06.240]  group that's coming in i don't believe that alex it looks like the same group to me listen here yoda
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:11.600]  don't try that with me he also said you know what was interesting to me that cheney's gonna lose his

[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:20.240]  and i was like well you know he was put there in the early eighties with the reagan administration

[2:08:20.240 --> 2:08:26.480]  some books and we just really enjoy and appreciate him spending time with us to give us his
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:34.480]  perspective on what's happening i wanted to get his take on the economy what's happening in this
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  election where he sees things going militarily all the open announcements of internet censorship
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:46.480]  in fact richard let's let's start out of the gates with something i haven't covered with you before
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:52.480]  um there's a whole array of things they're using to shut down the web but now in the western world
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:58.160]  they're openly announcing filters over alternative websites prisonplanet.com infowars.com are already
[2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:03.200]  banned and the wi-fi networks all over europe and england australia is announcing total
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:08.000]  chinese style censorship where the government only allows basically a few thousand sites through
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:15.920]  microsoft is coming out with new systems uh to censor uh we're on the national level uh the
[2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:21.120]  establishment is really losing the war for the hearts and minds and they have to i guess be able
[2:09:21.120 --> 2:09:27.600]  to move forward with this police state uh shut down or control curtail the web well that does seem
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:35.600]  to be what they are trying to do give me your take on it well um what we're seeing here at the end
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:43.760]  of the bush administration i think are a whole lot of things that are going to be uh done and
[2:09:43.760 --> 2:09:49.920]  not just in in this area but we've already seen in the economy the take down of the financial
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:58.640]  system we're now seeing also in uh the uh military area like we saw for example that announcement
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:05.520]  just made by uh gates uh about how the bush doctrine was going to be expanded to cover
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:15.360]  any nation that they deem supplying military aid to anybody they define as a terrorist including
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:20.960]  nations that you know rogue nations and so now there's provocative attacks bombing attacking
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:27.040]  villages with ground troops and syrian so it seems as though now at the very end of the
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:33.040]  the bush administration they're doing everything possible to present the next president with a
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:41.120]  fate of complete uh with um a whole series of things that have been done uh to clamp down
[2:10:41.120 --> 2:10:48.720]  to bring in this whole repression regime uh and it looks as though the internet is part of it i'm
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:54.160]  even getting rumblings from people i know in federal government agencies uh that they are doing
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:01.360]  things like this for example um in the area of environmental surveillance uh within nasa
[2:11:01.360 --> 2:11:08.080]  i'm being told that uh uh nasa is taking steps at the very end of the bush administration to
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:15.040]  get rid of environmental scientists they don't like so the word has gone out from the power of
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:24.240]  structure uh that the uh military repression state is going to be implemented and i think this is
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:30.720]  what whoever is elected president is going to be handed and uh because the president doesn't really
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:37.440]  give orders anymore the president takes orders uh i do not believe that either of the two candidates
[2:11:37.440 --> 2:11:43.600]  is going to be able to do anything about it or is even going to want to do anything about it let's go
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:48.960]  over the real power structure the shadow government which is now public uh it claims through the
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:53.840]  executive dominance over the judicial and legislative uh but now the president himself
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:12:00.240]  is under cog and under north com and under the military industrial complex system and governmental
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:05.440]  power has been handed to the top of the pyramid uh the private intergroup of international bankers
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:10.720]  uh that sit atop that is people like oh mccain will save us obama will save us no they've all
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:14.960]  signaled they're going to follow continually in the same order and i want you to comment on that
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:21.520]  and then pentagon advisors you might back off your phone a bit richard oh yeah oh yeah pentagon
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:28.320]  advisors warn of coming international crisis veteran consultant echoes warning from biden and
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:34.640]  powell they're all saying massive military crises on the 22nd 23rd naming dates massive
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.640]  financial crises you know folks think with the new election they're going to get changed but
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:45.840]  they think for the better no uh all the indicators are going into very deep tyranny yes that is what
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:54.400]  everything seems to be pointing to uh let me uh go over to the uh economic part of it if i could
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:13:02.960]  for just a minute uh biden has said and there were these quotes from this meeting he uh apparently
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:09.280]  attended and spoke to off the record uh with some of the top democratic advisors that nobody
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:16.000]  should expect the obama biden administration to come in and launch a any kind of a new deal program
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.520]  that focuses on uh job creation or income creation for the middle class or for working
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:29.120]  people that they can forget about that and this was repeated in an interview that robert rubin gave
[2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:36.240]  uh and rubin of course has become one of uh obama's closest advisors as has paul volker and let me
[2:13:36.240 --> 2:13:39.680]  just throw him before i forget even i want you to comment on this even senator dodd said the new
[2:13:39.680 --> 2:13:44.720]  orc times the banks are hoarding the money it's going to cause a revolution none of it's going
[2:13:44.720 --> 2:13:49.360]  to the people we just have to pay for it and he said it's going to cause a physical revolution
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:54.960]  well that's why they're moving in with the security apparatus well the new york times also had this
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:02.400]  story where they got information about a private meeting that was held by jp morgan chase where
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:10.080]  jp morgan chase was telling its managers that we are heading for a deep recession or a depression
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:16.560]  both words were used and that they were going to tighten up on lending and the reason that jp
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:23.760]  morgan chase was out there buying up other banks now including the use of government bailout funds
[2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:29.760]  to do that as we know is to protect themselves and so the banking system is consolidating now
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:37.120]  under the largest banks and the largest ones that are now in the field of course are a city bank
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:42.880]  jp morgan chase and golden sacks and that's all at the expense of the real economy so
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:47.360]  understand folks you're not going to get any of it you're just going to pay for it and they're
[2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:52.240]  openly saying they're going to use police and military to enforce it i mean this is not this
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:59.040]  this is the classic third world takeover scenario yes it is it's it's the kind of thing that we've
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:09.040]  seen in countries like argentina or chili or uh... you know other nations greece when it went into
[2:15:09.040 --> 2:15:15.360]  a military dictatorship we are seeing all that happening but here's the here's what i want to
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:21.200]  suggest that people really focus on when we're talking about the economy and we're talking about
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:28.640]  the uh... now trillions of dollars that are being fed into the banking system uh... the key economic
[2:15:28.640 --> 2:15:35.440]  indicator that i look at when when i've done my uh... analysis is one that people don't ordinarily
[2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:41.840]  consider which is consumer purchasing power we know that three quarters of our economy
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:49.120]  runs off of the consumer uh... economy consumer purchases and we know that because
[2:15:49.120 --> 2:15:54.160]  uh... we shipped so many of our good jobs overseas which was part of the plan that the
[2:15:54.160 --> 2:16:00.240]  banking system came up with a long time ago uh... wages and salaries in this country for
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:06.960]  really fifteen or twenty years have been stagnant so the way they compensated for that during the
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:13.440]  bush administration was with the housing bubble uh... it was with the mortgage loans and the home
[2:16:13.440 --> 2:16:20.160]  equity loans that were constantly being fed into the system as the price of houses escalated
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:26.160]  through the inflationary monetary policy of the federal reserve during the housing bubble
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:33.760]  and then when people sold their homes and moved on to the next one they got capital gains off of
[2:16:33.760 --> 2:16:39.920]  that and of course the capital gains tax rate was lowered and so that money was also fed into the
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:47.040]  producing economy all of that is gone today there's been there is a tremendous deficit
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:54.560]  at the present time of purchasing power within the consuming economy and now with banks tightening
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:17:00.320]  up on credit and and and uh... they have to tighten up on credit because nobody has enough
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:07.680]  money anymore to repay their loans uh... there's an enormous deficit of purchasing power and what
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:15.040]  that is going to do is it's going to bring the gdp down to that level and so uh... we are seeing
[2:17:15.040 --> 2:17:24.000]  right now a collapse of the physical economy and again uh... from all their own documents this has
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.960]  been orchestrated by design now they're proposing a trilateral world currency a world government
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:33.440]  oven by the bankers will pay our carbon taxes into them can you speak to that as a monetary
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:38.320]  historian well all of that is happening there's been talk and it's all you know it's come out of
[2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:43.360]  the council on foreign relations which is the think tank that reports to the trilateral commission
[2:17:44.320 --> 2:17:48.320]  about creating a multi-currency regime and of course this is where the
[2:17:49.280 --> 2:17:54.480]  concept of the amaro came out of that wasn't just made up by conspiracy theorists those were studies
[2:17:54.480 --> 2:18:01.760]  done by the trilateral commission to create a uh... north american union with an amaro currency
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:09.200]  and then you're going to have the euro currency in europe and the dependencies uh... on europe
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:13.440]  particularly in the middle east then you're going to have some kind of an oriental currency perhaps
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:20.080]  the chinese currency or perhaps the japanese yen so the idea is to completely eliminate any
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:27.600]  possibility of any nation having an independent currency uh... the countries that have had an
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:33.440]  independent currency like for instance iceland uh... have been uh... attacked their currency has
[2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:38.240]  been destroyed and they've been thrown into the arms of the international monetary fund
[2:18:38.880 --> 2:18:44.480]  and so yeah we are seeing that we are seeing the world being divided up amongst probably
[2:18:44.480 --> 2:18:50.880]  three currencies that are all going to kind of feed into uh... one worldwide monetary authority
[2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:55.040]  that is not under any sovereign and it's not even under the united nations
[2:18:55.040 --> 2:18:58.880]  now i keep asking where is the united nations all in all this and
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:04.880]  the united nations has pretty much been shunted aside um... you never even hear about it anymore
[2:19:04.880 --> 2:19:10.800]  uh... in in the international arena of trying to keep some kind of international order so it's

[2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:51.440]  prison planet dot com four different clips there's even more to come on prison planet on tv and high
[2:23:51.440 --> 2:23:57.040]  quality on the bus with willy hell yeah there's a reason to investigate 9-11 and you can even
[2:23:57.040 --> 2:24:02.320]  see in a clip too where i'm arguing with ventura about how many people are awake to 9-11 so there's
[2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:11.920]  some sparring going on good debate uh there's uh again total i guess five different parts there's
[2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:17.040]  two new two new parts on the bus uh in this and we posted some other stuff yesterday morning but
[2:24:17.040 --> 2:24:26.320]  this was yesterday evening really powerful stuff that's up on info wars dot com right now public
[2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:34.800]  delusion and professional silence war was a motive destroying evidence suppresses the truth the cover
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:40.720]  up conceals the real crime those are some of the uh sub articles that erin dykes did did a wonderful
[2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:46.000]  job getting the sound so quick and then look it's an interesting culture it's fun to get jessie
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:50.480]  ventura willy nelson together and have discussions you know i mean it's an opportunity we do this for
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:54.160]  our listeners and viewers and it gets people talking about 9-11 truth it's i'm talking about
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:25:00.000]  other issues that's why we went out and did it it was a lot of fun um going back to richard c cook
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:06.240]  in the short segment we're coming back in the next more time to talk richard uh studying history
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:11.760]  uh and again richard's written for the washington post consulted for nasa the white house long
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:16.640]  bio you can read it as website uh we've got a link to that up on info wars dot com
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:24.800]  but uh richard how do you see this unfolding i mean regardless of who's elected because this
[2:25:24.800 --> 2:25:31.360]  national security apparatus really is unfolding and uh they're completely ruthless i mean to have
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:36.880]  the white house say no one's allowed to see what treasuries doing it's all blacked out in secret
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:41.200]  congress can't see it we're just going to take trillions of dollars and do whatever we want
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:47.120]  and congress if you don't pass the bailout we're going to have martial law i mean that is martial
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:54.000]  law i mean they they've done it and and they're just going to squeeze this it's it and the public
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:57.760]  starting to wake up to what's happening why do you think i mean how bad do you think it'll get
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:00.480]  and what do you think about again senator dodd saying there's going to be a revolution
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:10.080]  well senator dodd may be saying that in order to divert attention away from what is really going
[2:26:10.080 --> 2:26:16.320]  on because the revolution is taking place and it's taking place by the banking industry to
[2:26:16.320 --> 2:26:21.920]  knock down all the uh last remnants of a constitutional system that's right they're the
[2:26:21.920 --> 2:26:26.480]  illegitimate government they're the usurpers that's correct so for him to turn around and
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:34.480]  point at the people as the source of a revolution is just a diversionary tactic i think uh on the
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:40.560]  part of people like him because if you uh ask who has really uh approved of all of these things
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.440]  congress has approved of every single thing that's happened uh they've gotten congress's
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:51.760]  rubber stamp for every step they've taken and it's not the congress is standing up there
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:56.640]  warning about what the people are going to do it's the congress that has betrayed the people
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:27:01.360]  uh every step of the way including this last bailout bill including all of the e-dropping
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:06.320]  measures including continuing to fund the military i mean while they were debating
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:12.560]  the bailout package congress passed a six hundred billion dollar authorization
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:21.040]  for defense for fiscal year 2009 on top of a 175 dollar billion supplemental appropriation
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:28.000]  for the iraq and the and the iran war so not only is the banking system getting these trillion
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:34.480]  dollar bailouts now the military industrial complex is getting their own uh package well
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:39.680]  the headline was it was a trillion dollar defense budget well it is when you add everything up when
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:44.720]  you add the the authorization to the supplementals you're getting a trillion dollars in defense i
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:49.360]  mean they know the currencies going down they know the country's going down they engineered it
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:56.080]  and they are just sucking everything out and then now they passed uh secret police irs provisions
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:01.440]  global carbon tax provisions right i mean they are just going to squeeze the public yeah and here's
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:07.120]  something interesting i put this in my last article the defense authorization act contains
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:16.800]  300 million dollars for a group of people to write uh articles in iraq to influence the
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:22.400]  minds of the iraqi people to favor the united states now maybe they're going to do that but
[2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:29.760]  300 million dollars i mean what is that money really for then you've got this uh uh authorization
[2:28:29.760 --> 2:28:37.280]  in there for these uh units to be placed on the back of trucks that are going to shoot microwave
[2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:43.920]  uh radiation as crowd control devices that the raytheon corporation is developing and each of
[2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:50.800]  these units costs five million dollars and the article that i read about this uh said that these
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:56.080]  were to be used for crowd control in the united states and it said it can cause death yeah i can
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:29:00.880]  yeah yeah no no that's the new that's what you get folks you give the banker all your money and
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:07.760]  then he microwaves you so this is this is what's happening but i think that um what we really
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:15.920]  should be looking at uh is the plan that the uh military obviously has and obviously obama
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:21.360]  is going along with this to start something in january in the middle east that could be
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:29.120]  the big war now let's talk about the the catalyst the crisis coming up we're on the march the
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:38.800]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network you know as a father and a husband one

[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:13.840]  first and then let's get into the big crisis i mean why are they being so obvious
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:19.760]  i mean pal saying the 22nd the 23rd it will happen but i won't tell you what it is i mean
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:24.480]  they love bragging of course he's a night commander of the order of bath under the queenie so
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:34.640]  so yeah um well my website www.richardccook.com now my new book is going to be out within the
[2:37:34.640 --> 2:37:40.160]  next couple weeks alex let me tell you where to get that uh the book is called we hold these
[2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:48.240]  truths the hope of monetary reform and uh that's being sold now off my publisher's website it's
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:54.800]  tendril press t-e-n-d-r-i-l they're a small publisher in colorado very good company and you
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:38:06.000]  can go to www.tendrilpress.com and order my new book uh my new book is about monetary reform and
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:10.960]  it's just you know i'm reading the page proofs this week to get the thing ready to to go out
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:19.840]  and to me it's just amazing how easy it would be if we really had control of our monetary system
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:26.240]  to get rid of this debt-based monetary system that the banks run from the top down and that
[2:38:26.240 --> 2:38:33.360]  they've been running for decades really uh having total control since the federal reserve act of
[2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:41.120]  1913 was passed just how easy it would be to get rid of this and to begin to run our own monetary
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:46.160]  system uh based on the principle i've been talking about which is that credit really is a public
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:53.600]  utility just like water or clean air or electricity how easy it would be to to capitalize our own
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:58.880]  financial system within our own country our own nation and use it for public purposes for the
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:03.200]  benefit of the people instead we've been used to build the new world order and now there's
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:10.880]  throwing us as a black widow spider kills her mate uh after he's done the deed uh or like a
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:17.760]  female praying manus eats her mate uh i mean we've been used up and it's over and god i feel sorry
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:22.320]  for people we'll have you on when the book comes out and i want to spend a whole hour on monetary
[2:39:22.320 --> 2:39:25.920]  solutions and i and the reason you know your solution will work is it's been done many times
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:30.960]  in other countries but let's get into the big surprise the big thing they can list the date
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:35.360]  but and the pentagon comes out and says yeah big surprise i mean are they going to sneak attack
[2:39:35.360 --> 2:39:39.360]  russia again are they going to start a war in pakistan are they going to stage a terror attack
[2:39:39.360 --> 2:39:45.120]  are they going to default on their debts worldwide the 23rd i mean what what until are you getting
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:50.320]  you know formerly even working for the white house this is the amazing thing that uh they all
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:56.640]  seem now to be telegraphing and they're read somewhere that uh it's in the nature of evil
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:01.360]  that they will come out and tell you ahead of time what they're going to do because
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:06.640]  they get such pleasure out of scaring you have to death with it but that's one of the tactics
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:11.040]  they use is to stampede everybody into feeling and thinking oh well there's nothing we can do
[2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:16.240]  about it it's a message that they're on present it will it's also a message that they're omnipresent
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:21.680]  and for those in the know it's a message we did it yeah that's right and i've been communicating
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:30.800]  with people in the middle east i had an email exchange recently with an engineer uh he is in
[2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:39.200]  china now but he came from iraq and he also spent time in dubai in the united arab emirates
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:45.040]  and he's saying the war is coming i'm also hearing the same thing from people out of israel
[2:40:45.040 --> 2:40:53.040]  uh fact i got an email message uh today from uh someone who had to leave israel uh for his own
[2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:58.400]  safety and that's why biden is saying that's why biden is saying hey the people aren't going to
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:02.640]  like what we're going to do yeah and pal saying people are going to like what what what obama
[2:41:02.640 --> 2:41:07.440]  is going to do so this whole time we're worried about bush doing it right but then obama comes in
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:13.040]  and that's in the the left is just going to be sucking air but well i'm sorry go ahead the left
[2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:24.320]  has been totally co-opted in this by this change business and these uh uh pretenses at uh an economic
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:30.880]  stimulus and i pointed out in my last article that the entire program that obama has been
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:37.840]  has put forward as an economic stimulus amounts to a hundred and seventy five dollars per capita
[2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:43.840]  within the united states hundred and seventy five dollars per person is what obama is proposing
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:50.000]  to put into the producing economy in the face of what could be uh another great to basically
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:56.560]  there basically i mean i mean they use an analogy the elite gets ten thousand dollars in the whole
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:01.920]  u.s gets a hundred dollars yeah that's what's going on and let's go back to israel let's go back
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:10.160]  to go back to to mike my uh uh a person from uh who who's been in israel he says half the people
[2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:15.040]  in israel are assuming that there will be a war and that israel itself is on the chopping block
[2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:22.000]  for this because uh it's not that israel any longer is driving policy for the united states
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:27.600]  i mean israel has one and a half percent of the population of that region they're they're uh a
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:33.520]  dropping the bucket in in the middle east uh it's going to be the united states sweeping through uh
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:44.880]  uh the middle east uh into iran but really it's all just uh staging uh the big war that is coming
[2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:52.880]  with uh russia and with china and obama is constantly uh now beating the war drums with
[2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:58.720]  russia telling us over and over again how russia's are a rogue nation russia's an autocracy
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:06.160]  but uh if you want to know what they're really thinking there was a paper prepared for the 2008
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:14.080]  uh bukarest uh summit of nato by five uh nato generals including american
[2:43:14.080 --> 2:43:23.200]  uh french german uh a couple others which identified the target as china and china was
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:29.280]  identified as the target because of the huge amount of dollars that china holds and there has
[2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:35.600]  been speculation that if the united states ever defaults on its debt and leaves china holding
[2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:42.400]  the bag then china itself is going to break ties with the united states and that seems to be what
[2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:51.280]  is setting the stage and the amazing thing of all of this i find alex is that if we have a world war
[2:43:51.280 --> 2:43:58.400]  three and it certainly looks as though the united states is preparing for it along with nato this
[2:43:58.400 --> 2:44:05.280]  will be a currency war a war over the failed us dollar and that's to me just just remarkable it's
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:11.600]  not even over resources it's over dollars currency but what pretext are they going to stage some terror
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:16.800]  attacks or military events were they trying to start that two months ago with a sneak attack
[2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:22.000]  through the proxy in georgia on south oceania ducasia well that seemed to be one of the things
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:29.200]  that was being tried although russia put a stop to that real fast uh russia i think surprised
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:33.920]  people maybe they didn't surprise everybody but i think they they they shocked a lot of people
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:42.000]  as to just how quickly and how efficiently they were able to put a lid on that whole georgia
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:52.160]  business that the president of georgia kind of uh wandered into uh so that didn't work uh now i
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:57.040]  i would have to guess that the provocation is going to be somewhere in the uh middle east
[2:44:57.040 --> 2:45:02.640]  maybe in the persian gulf because as you know we've got an enormous part of the us fleet in there
[2:45:02.640 --> 2:45:13.040]  uh how how easy or difficult would it be uh to stage an attack there uh of some kind that uh
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:20.240]  uh would then trigger the whole thing i mean the these international incidents are not difficult
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:26.400]  to arrange and well we've had cheney again just a few months ago who was reported by uh msnbc and
[2:45:26.400 --> 2:45:34.400]  others in the new yorker the cy hersh you by the way we're lining up for the show openly coming out
[2:45:34.400 --> 2:45:39.520]  and saying that cheney wanted to have navy seal stage an attack on us ships yeah in in the Strait
[2:45:39.520 --> 2:45:46.400]  of Hormuz so well the really interesting thing is how colon pal has suddenly appeared on the scene
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:56.080]  no one in their right mind would do what he has done of announcing his support for obama and then
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:46:03.520]  within what a week starting to talk about a major incident on the 21st or 22nd of january
[2:46:04.800 --> 2:46:13.840]  no one that no sane person would do that unless it was part of the plan and of course obama seems
[2:46:13.840 --> 2:46:20.560]  to be quite willing to say or do anything at this point so this is a provocation the script this is
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:27.440]  a provocation we have continual attacks in pakistan by us forces right now we have uh sneak attacks
[2:46:27.440 --> 2:46:33.840]  going into uh other countries uh like george uh into russia but on the border but not just there
[2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:39.520]  going in to assyria and putting ground troops on the ground shooting people and listen to what obama
[2:46:39.520 --> 2:46:48.320]  is saying about afghanistan uh he keeps saying over and over again that he wants us to go into
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:46:54.400]  afghanistan to take out osama bin laden so they're going to stage a capture of bin laden
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:47:01.360]  osama bin laden according to the uh the sources that that are out there probably hasn't even
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:10.000]  been alive for the last five years and he was in deep kidney dialysis uh failure uh in 2001
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:16.800]  not only in saudi arabia or or the uar uh but in pakistan where he was treated in a hospital
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:24.640]  uh in fact he may have been in a hospital in pakistan on 9 11 getting dialysis we know he
[2:47:24.640 --> 2:47:30.160]  was in dubai weeks before i met with the c i h that's right so this man has not even been there
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:36.480]  uh uh for for years so bottom line richard cook what do you see happening i see happening an
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:41.040]  attempt to start a major war in the middle east through some provocation that's going to take
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:48.240]  place in january uh after obama is inaugurated or maybe they'll even do what they did with reagan
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:54.080]  you remember when reagan was nominated was inaugurated and suddenly we we flipped over
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:48:00.080]  to the hostages coming out of iran yes and what a great event that was here we had a new president
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:07.760]  and now we had uh hostages appearing mysteriously on on the tv the same day i think it could be
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:12.000]  something just like that and we know they paid him a lot of money and weapons to do that right
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:17.280]  that was all staged in george hw bush was part of that and it's admitted it's staged i mean i
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:23.840]  yeah so the whole thing is is being set up well let's look at the local uh in the in the us in
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:28.080]  europe as they shut down main street more and more and as the public learns that all the money was
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:34.480]  taken and given to offshore banks what is the public going to do i think the public has no choice
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:41.440]  but to do anything possible to protect themselves um now what is the main
[2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:49.280]  liability that uh that we have the members of the public have well the main liability is debt
[2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:57.040]  is that we're all in debt uh jobs are going to be lost and people are still going to have to pay
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:02.160]  you know we're going to be done to uh to pay their credit card loans right now there's a trillion
[2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:08.320]  dollars out there and in credit card loans uh and interest rates on the credit card loans are going
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:15.680]  up and up uh i know people who who are being charged 29 percent now on their credit card payments
[2:49:16.320 --> 2:49:23.440]  so people have got to face the fact that they're deeply in debt uh that they need a source of
[2:49:23.440 --> 2:49:29.600]  income that they need the necessities of life and it's a time when individuals and groups and
[2:49:29.600 --> 2:49:34.480]  communities are going to have to come together and to realize that this government isn't going to
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:39.520]  do anything for anybody right now well i agree with you we need to get the word out and it's
[2:49:39.520 --> 2:49:44.960]  already out there partially this is a completely rogue government yeah this is a criminal military
[2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:50.880]  third world dictatorship type move yes i can't believe this is happening to us my children my
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:55.920]  family i mean i'm freaked out richard and you know i'm i'm someone of a tough guy you know i expect
[2:49:55.920 --> 2:50:00.800]  this i live this year you're you know you are a realist you're you know by tough i mean mentally
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:05.840]  tough you're ready for it but does it not even shake you to your core to realize that that that
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:11.600]  we're living what people were living in the mid 1930s in germany i mean we're really we got front
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:18.480]  row seats with some bad stuff yes we do and folks if you're not shaking to your core there's something
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:24.560]  wrong with you these people are going to give us no quarter and what that means it's like
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:27.200]  in a fight and they beat you and you're on the ground they got a knife to your throat
[2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:34.000]  then they're not going to stop and they pose as our saviors i mean they are just committing crime

[2:53:45.760 --> 2:53:52.960]  i was sitting in traffic listening to the radio we're gonna have uh jason barmer's for the last
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:58.880]  52 minutes the eight after in here i've got so much work piled up i literally have to and i'm
[2:53:58.880 --> 2:54:03.280]  glad he's here he does a great job sitting in sat he's leaving town to mar back to new york
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:07.520]  i want to keep richard c cook five minutes in the next hour so i have a chance to talk to
[2:54:07.520 --> 2:54:13.920]  scott john surely and ted and a few other callers for him but you know richard they covertly paid
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:19.520]  off local police federalized him i mean open bribery cia dealt the force that i discovered
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:27.280]  in the late 90s this is a far-reaching military industrial complex takeover and uh i guess it
[2:54:27.280 --> 2:54:31.760]  all rests with the police and military not going along with it but it's so sophisticated i mean
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:36.560]  i'm not claiming i'm smart but it took me years to even understand it for people that haven't
[2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:42.720]  studied history they just can't grasp that they're powerful people who want to control and run everything
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:48.640]  and they're ruthless and they've looked like they've done it that's right and that's why i've
[2:54:48.640 --> 2:54:53.840]  tried in what i've been writing to give the historical roots of this to show where it came
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:54:58.320]  from because people don't understand that you know people just take everything out of context
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:03.760]  but i also learned from a friend of mine who who was in intelligence in in in state department
[2:55:03.760 --> 2:55:08.960]  intelligence that when the patriot acts were passed in the homeland security department was
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:17.200]  set up the fbi uh white color crime unit was eliminated all of the fbi resources were put
[2:55:17.200 --> 2:55:22.240]  on to uh domestic terrorism if you can believe that means political commissar and for those
[2:55:22.240 --> 2:55:27.120]  that don't know that's now admitted so they literally took the watchers off themselves this
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:31.760]  is white collar criminals right taking control of the government these were the ones who should
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:36.880]  have been watching wall street who should have been watching the security and exchange commission
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:43.360]  watching the mortgage bubble uh that no one in the federal government had an eye on the people
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:48.800]  who should have been doing that were deliberately removed from that responsibility and here's the
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:53.120]  bad news now they're going to redouble it but they're focusing on low-level middle class
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:58.400]  where you dot an i wrong cross a t wrong you're going away right right that's exactly don't
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:06.160]  help us man these are criminals what we're seeing so you know we we are at a time when every person
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:14.080]  in in this country and and probably uh beyond this country has a choice to make you know do we go
[2:56:14.080 --> 2:56:21.360]  along with this uh or do we somehow make a stand you know in our lives in our responsibilities
[2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:28.240]  and it comes down to that it comes down to individual decision and then having said that
[2:56:29.040 --> 2:56:34.880]  people in communities and groups have got to get together for example uh there is no reason
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:41.200]  why people cannot put together some kind of local currency system or lower or local
[2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:49.520]  barter label labor exchange system or barter system to at least be able to pool resources
[2:56:49.520 --> 2:56:55.280]  on getting through this situation uh that's being done in a lot of places well well folks
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:59.920]  you know how to do that but people in the cities they don't even talk to their neighbors so no no
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:05.920]  people in the cities are are atomized isolated uh even though they're they're packed together so
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:12.320]  but nevertheless we are human beings you know we do have a power of choice and survival has
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:16.560]  a way of making you get up off your butt it does and then you know a lot of dreams are going to
[2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:22.720]  have to be deferred uh today you know we all have our dreams we all want uh this that and the other
[2:57:22.720 --> 2:57:27.680]  thing but uh a lot of those dreams are going to have to just be set on the back burner it's got
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:31.600]  to be put on hold because of the new world or nightmare yeah because we've got we're talking
[2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:36.880]  survival and we're talking basic human integrity you know what do we do in our individual lives
[2:57:36.880 --> 2:57:41.920]  instead they're going to have the cops squeezing us pushing us making it as bad as possible right
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:47.200]  but as you pointed out the cops are human beings too and every cop has to make their own decision
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:52.640]  about whether they where they stand uh i mean russia went through this russia went through
[2:57:52.640 --> 2:57:58.240]  this for several decades and they had a very large prison system they had the gulag we've read
[2:57:58.240 --> 2:58:05.280]  social needs and books about it those who had a will to to live to to be honest decent people
[2:58:05.280 --> 2:58:11.520]  got through that we've got to do the same richard cook stay with us one minute break

[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:34.480]  for about 11 years and in that 11 years i i have uh i have tried various methods but more recently
[3:00:34.480 --> 3:00:39.680]  in the last few years i've got something that's actually legal and has kept the irs off my back
[3:00:39.680 --> 3:00:46.560]  and uh for a few years i'm actually helping other people to do the same so um i know it's hard to

[3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:59.760]  well there are a couple websites they're available yeah and i'm also wondering if you are interested
[3:00:59.760 --> 3:01:05.040]  in the subject alex yourself beyond just uh me here's the problem i morally have to look at something
[3:01:05.040 --> 3:01:10.000]  before i promote it and you can get around it they're about 50 million non filers so people
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.640]  think they're getting away from it it is a legitimate it does go to pay the debt for the
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:19.760]  private banks it is a scam uh but i've you know i've seen a lot of people claiming they've got
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:23.920]  this silver bullet or that silver bullet that just means that the predators haven't gotten to you yet
[3:01:23.920 --> 3:01:28.800]  that's what they're putting in the cashless society to with the thumb scanners the national
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:34.400]  sales taxes to track and control you and so just send me some info on it i i appreciate your call

[3:01:46.880 --> 3:01:51.760]  legal loophole although it's a rogue government it doesn't matter if the income tax is unconstitutional
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:56.320]  they don't care they have been in black uniforms that eat their guts and ask for seconds what what
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:04.560]  i say is that every individual has got to do what they feel best what they feel they need to do to
[3:02:04.560 --> 3:02:11.760]  maintain their personal integrity and their ability to live and survive and the same for their loved

[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:42.480]  town usa so let's go to that john you got a cute up yep it's already all right let's do it
[3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:47.520]  in newark today a community gathered in an attempt to draw attention to their ongoing
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:52.240]  fight against senseless violence it was a peaceful demonstration that was until the march ended
[3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:57.680]  violently as a newark police officer put a cbs2 photographer in a chokehold handcuffed him and
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:01.760]  put him in the back of a patrol car our christine slow nearly went with him she is more now from a
[3:09:01.760 --> 3:09:08.640]  wild scene what started out is a peaceful march in front of a church by parents whose children
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:14.320]  have been murdered on the streets of newark put their camera away put the camera away put the
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:23.600]  camera away now get the camera out of here right there you get your hands up turn violent when
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:30.480]  a newer police officer arrested our cbs2 photographer covering the story stop put your hands behind
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:36.400]  your back now he's going with me he's going with me you can't arrest him i can do whatever i want
[3:09:36.400 --> 3:09:41.600]  the camera kept rolling as the officer put our photographer jim quote a mind in a chokehold
[3:09:41.600 --> 3:09:46.880]  then handcuffed him witnesses snapped these pictures he went to put the the camera down
[3:09:46.880 --> 3:09:50.560]  before he got the opportunity to the police officer just came in and knocked it down
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.120]  with the handcuffs on him got him by his neck he was just overly just it was just out of control
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:10:01.040]  i couldn't believe how they grabbed him and then grabbed you and tried to take your camera
[3:10:01.040 --> 3:10:05.200]  the officer placed our photographer in a cruiser for almost an hour
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:13.440]  but councilwoman mildred crump who was there attending church services pushed for his release
[3:10:13.440 --> 3:10:21.040]  and talked to the officer i did show him the picture of the um your cameraman who was cuffed
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:28.880]  and in what appeared to be a chokehold his side of the story is that he had asked him not to do it
[3:10:28.880 --> 3:10:35.440]  and when he uh persisted decided that he just wouldn't take it anymore yeah that's no side of
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:40.480]  the story at all was not trespassing shooting the story on public property the new work police
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:45.600]  department is not commenting the officer even threatened to arrest me let your business stay
[3:10:45.600 --> 3:10:50.800]  away from me right now or you'd be sitting in that car one of the reasons i said we need to release
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:58.640]  your uh a cameraman is because you have a constitutional right to uh videotape wow the
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:03.600]  constitution going on the new work police department says we won't comment until they have
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:09.760]  looked at all the facts in the meantime councilwoman crump says she will ask for an investigation
[3:11:09.760 --> 3:11:17.120]  christine slone cbs2 news well it sounds like all the facts are right there um guy trying to record
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:22.720]  the news gets put in a chokehold by a police officer because he thinks he's all powerful he's
[3:11:22.720 --> 3:11:29.360]  he's a big dude and uh he wanted the great thing is there's a reporter on the scene there and he's
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:34.480]  threatening to arrest her too well i'm glad the councilwoman realizes the guy has a constitutional
[3:11:34.480 --> 3:11:38.880]  right to be there no kidding whether he was with the news or not he had a constitutional right there
[3:11:38.880 --> 3:11:45.120]  to be with to be recording what was going on these are public servants let me repeat it
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:53.360]  they're not officials they are public servants we pay their wages with our taxes our labor
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:12:00.240]  so if they're public servants and you're on public property and i've got a camera i can record
[3:12:00.240 --> 3:12:08.080]  let me talk slower for the police officer you cannot put me in chokehold when i record you
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:13.920]  doing bad things you know next time soon we'll just be forget about the tasers the chokeholds
[3:12:13.920 --> 3:12:19.040]  the arrest soon they're just going to shoot you it is going to be like pop and you know the neoconsul
[3:12:19.040 --> 3:12:25.520]  rave about it i got an anti-war sign that pig was wearing an investigate 911 shirt i'm glad he
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:30.240]  shot him in the chest i wish he got him in the head that'll be the attitude all right
[3:12:30.240 --> 3:12:36.400]  said i take callers and i i keep my little promises so let's go to todd in texas todd what's on your
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:43.840]  mind we got your time to talk to you good talk to you too and you know uh... the show has been
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:48.400]  focusing on some really important issues uh... short term i want to focus on some long term
[3:12:48.400 --> 3:12:54.800]  i have you seen a movie a documentary called technocalypse now not yet man it's crazy it's
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:59.760]  a pro transhumanism movie and they interviewed some of the real big movies in it and these
[3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:06.480]  people are scary they're frightening um... it's kerswell and it's called it's called technocrats
[3:13:06.480 --> 3:13:10.560]  no no i know that but it's kerswell steven kerswell featured into he's one of those big technocrats
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:16.480]  he's in it man he's in it of course he is it's got the guy i'll be the great uh-huh just put
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:20.400]  out an article talking about how we may already be certain things that we may already be within
[3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:25.280]  a matrix like word it's crazy stuff but anyway i thought it'd be something that you may want to
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:30.480]  check out and i will i want to make a suggestion for a guest along those lines is a guy named
[3:13:30.480 --> 3:13:37.120]  francis pocoyama and he wrote a book called i post human future and he's very anti-transhuman
[3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:42.560]  um... he put out an article in foreign policy magazine uh... about transhumanism being the most
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:47.920]  dangerous idea of our time it is pretty dangerous he was also a member of pinac
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:51.520]  oh oh pinac project for a new american century oh how nice
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:56.000]  todd do me a favor take this information and the link to the movie go email it to
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:59.520]  erin info wars dot com i'll be in new york tomorrow i'm gonna try to pick up
[3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:03.760]  technocalypse and watch it this week i thank you for the call all right let's jump to the next call
[3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:08.240]  yeah transhumanism is really scary the reason i knew that kerswell would probably be in that
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:14.240]  movie is there's a plethora of documentaries and futurist programs out there in the mainstream
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:18.320]  really uh... about these subject matters and how they and they really promote it they're promoting
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:21.920]  the brain chip the one world consciousness uh... if you don't believe me check out
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:26.320]  uh... pbs they did one of a couple years ago it's just the whole history of the chip
[3:14:26.320 --> 3:14:29.680]  they had somebody playing uh... alice huxley
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:35.520]  who was the uh... basically he was the negative against it alice is like oh this is the brave
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:40.080]  new world but they even brought the the actor alice huxley around at the end of these like
[3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  oh this is a great idea
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:48.560]  brain chips great all right let's jump to joe and callie joe what's on your mind
[3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:53.840]  you with me joe listen up i wanted to bring up this uh... important uh... question to you
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:58.160]  it's an article that's covered in uh... joint report and uh... info wars
[3:14:58.160 --> 3:15:02.160]  and uh... question is this what would what do you think would have happened to you if you would
[3:15:02.160 --> 3:15:06.640]  have been caught on camera the day before nine eleven saying that our country would be
[3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:10.400]  a target of a terrorist attack coming in from a valley of a plane
[3:15:10.400 --> 3:15:15.280]  well i would imagine if it were me uh... the fb i would have been at my home there would
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:19.760]  have been no call or a another intelligence organization and i will probably would have
[3:15:19.760 --> 3:15:25.520]  been detained as uh... a suspect and at least interrogated thoroughly
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:28.480]  continue i would probably agree with you that would happen to me too but then
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:32.400]  let's take it one step further then you go on and then on camera you met as
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:36.640]  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee with the head of the pakistani isi
[3:15:36.640 --> 3:15:42.560]  director my mood on that uh... george tenet c a head senator bob graham and john
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:45.040]  kyle and let's not forget porter goss
[3:15:45.040 --> 3:15:49.040]  porter goss deputy secretary of state richard armatage and secretary of state
[3:15:49.040 --> 3:15:52.880]  colin pal conferred in the pakistani intelligence was indeed funding
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:56.000]  but tell them that well let's not forget the national security council who was
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:15:59.680]  also on that list and our vice president to be joe biden but again
[3:15:59.680 --> 3:16:03.680]  continue right which by the way kudos you cover them
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:07.040]  fabled enemies thank you now
[3:16:07.040 --> 3:16:10.320]  this past well october nineteen two thousand eight
[3:16:10.320 --> 3:16:13.840]  uh... to sunday to go fortune teller joe biden
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:16.880]  not only predicted promise and guaranteed
[3:16:16.880 --> 3:16:21.200]  an international crisis jenner a generator crisis which by the way
[3:16:21.200 --> 3:16:24.400]  wept with dictionaries has generated premeditated design
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:28.400]  to bring to bring to bring about including the middle east
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:31.600]  russia a nuclear capable package that and of course
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:33.960]  what many experts including uh...
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:38.720]  uh... the lady who was assassinated uh... uh... from a pakistan the former
[3:16:38.720 --> 3:16:42.760]  leader of uh... yeah buto told on the process interview

[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.960]  facilitated these wire transfers that you just discussed through the pakistani
[3:16:58.960 --> 3:17:02.400]  isaac chief general mamouda med continue right
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:03.600]  and my point is that
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:06.680]  if an American average american would have made these predictions
[3:17:06.680 --> 3:17:08.800]  with such impurity uncertainty
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:12.320]  then wouldn't win an average american be arrested interrogated for at least

[3:23:43.720 --> 3:23:49.000]  best instrumentals of all time let me say it again of all time but we're taking
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:52.960]  your call to the Alex Jones show over here we have Teresa from Denver on the
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:57.480]  line and she's talking about the heirs and their international trusts and you
[3:23:57.480 --> 3:24:03.840]  were going through your second point so please continue Teresa okay finance the
[3:24:03.840 --> 3:24:09.000]  bank audit that's happening right now in the world is basically secondary to you
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:12.320]  know they put all these portfolios together and they skim the money off the
[3:24:12.320 --> 3:24:17.040]  top and they put every asset known to mankind into these portfolios and
[3:24:17.040 --> 3:24:22.680]  eventually the portfolios turned out to less than zero in the negative arena so
[3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:27.080]  by default you're going to have a collapse like we have now this was not
[3:24:27.080 --> 3:24:30.240]  planned this is just you know crappy finance so you really don't think that
[3:24:30.240 --> 3:24:33.920]  it's engineered in any way shape or form now it's logic there's a difference
[3:24:33.920 --> 3:24:37.800]  between somebody engineering something and something and logic yeah but listen
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:42.160]  to the top the top percentile are going to take this just like they took the
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:45.560]  twenties and they're going to have more assets than ever and pennies on the
[3:24:45.560 --> 3:24:48.160]  dollar so I've got disagree with you there but continue
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:53.480]  finance it in finance your high above our work special off with with the the
[3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:56.960]  elite in the world negotiations millions billions and trillions for sale
[3:24:56.960 --> 3:25:02.080]  of the patient of the economy now the highest level of finance is a trust
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:05.960]  which is the old money everything that everybody's talking about luminati blah
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:10.920]  blah blah blah royal bloodlines etc etc damn from the trust the highest level
[3:25:10.920 --> 3:25:16.600]  are debentures which break up the money by law international law the trust
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:20.520]  down from debentures our instruments our notes our deeds down from
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:24.640]  instruments our gold and down from gold is coin which is currency across the
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:30.920]  board these five basic concept of finance in the world which run our world
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:36.560]  economies is unknown to the average Joe much less the scholar okay so you if
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:42.320]  you put that into into perspective that's where you get finance it's not
[3:25:42.320 --> 3:25:47.120]  some big you know conspiracy it's just pure logic behind the law just like the
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:50.720]  law is you know don't fit on the street alright Teresa I see your point but I
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:53.440]  gotta tell you I think it's a lot more contrived than that I think that these
[3:25:53.440 --> 3:25:56.720]  guys do engineer these these types of things so that they can consolidate
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:25:59.560]  power I don't think it's just a luck system if that were true then
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:02.680]  eventually some of these families would go under lady thinks not engineered
[3:26:02.680 --> 3:26:06.320]  and she thinks that the financial crisis she says she works black ops and she
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:10.200]  also thinks that the financial crisis is not because she works black ops you
[3:26:10.200 --> 3:26:14.600]  know she used to work black ops and she says that it is this week financial
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:18.880]  times all these experts they admit they're engineering it here's Dodd saying
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:22.520]  they're hoarding the money right here yeah there's no new mortgages and they're
[3:26:22.520 --> 3:26:26.440]  just gonna take the money from from this bailout they're not gonna lend any
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:30.440]  more out fine hey there's no new order either all right let's jump to Fred and
[3:26:30.440 --> 3:26:34.800]  Philly Fred what's on your mind my man okay I don't want to spend a lot of time
[3:26:34.800 --> 3:26:42.120]  on the Tariq on Teresa's call but I'm with you on the on the on this recent
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:50.280]  crisis reason being the IMF did issue a binding directive to pull in all the
[3:26:50.280 --> 3:26:55.800]  central banks gold and this was this was early this year spring I believe and
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:01.440]  also in 07 they issued directives to that effect that they were going to
[3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:06.480]  consolidate all the central banks gold under their owner and I wait when by
[3:27:06.480 --> 3:27:10.200]  you by you saying consolidate all the central banks go where's it going next
[3:27:10.200 --> 3:27:13.880]  of it yeah where's it going though I mean how do you consolidate the central
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:18.320]  banks gold like I say that that's something that was imprinted electronic
[3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:22.000]  media I don't remember you I guess you're gonna have to take my word for it
[3:27:22.000 --> 3:27:27.840]  I'm pretty reliable on what I had seen as far as their press release and their
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:31.720]  their their action well well I gotta ask you what do you think the purpose of that
[3:27:31.720 --> 3:27:35.880]  would be to consolidate their gold do you think it's maybe to put it out there
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:38.640]  and then say that there's a shortage so that they'll have to round up the gold
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:42.560]  of American citizens like they did in the 30s I think you could I could say that
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:46.720]  I don't have a conclusion but I think it is if you want to do a show with Bob
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:51.240]  Chapman on that and specifically talk about it I think that could be very
[3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:57.800]  fun to be coming up soon actually in doing that we're relying on the central
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:02.760]  other central banks other you know not I am not for going to be reliant on other
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:08.760]  forms of money and I think that that then that changes the political institutions
[3:28:08.760 --> 3:28:11.600]  of those countries well anytime that you're gonna you're gonna change the
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:14.680]  monetary system yeah it's going to be a political institution they have to set up
[3:28:14.680 --> 3:28:23.360]  new units think that it is basically the the crisis was basically a push rather
[3:28:23.360 --> 3:28:30.160]  than a poll you had a a creation of credit through central banks through the
[3:28:30.160 --> 3:28:34.440]  Federal Reserve we know how that ballooned and that was pushed through
[3:28:34.440 --> 3:28:39.440]  channels it's not you know janitors trying to get a house or something in the
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:44.480]  inner city pulling in all of this credit by the way more than 80% of the
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:51.080]  capital in the in the bubble went to already well-heeled property oh yeah
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:55.800]  people have more than one home more than one business slum lords come on let's

[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:46.840]  taking them all I mean I just had a woman tell me that this financial crisis is
[3:33:46.840 --> 3:33:50.760]  all a big mistake yeah right they'll they've only been trying to bring in the
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:55.400]  North American Union for years you know they're only letting you know tons of
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:59.000]  illegals to come in to destabilize the economy here they've only taken most
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:04.400]  people's 401ks and pension funds they've only taken all the factory jobs there's
[3:34:04.400 --> 3:34:09.520]  no there's no more benefits out there for people remember the good old days

[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:27.640]  really started phasing out boy not gonna have so many factories here anymore
[3:34:27.640 --> 3:34:33.320]  we're not gonna build anything all of a sudden now our money is worth less than
[3:34:33.320 --> 3:34:38.840]  the Canadian dollar think about it we're the we're supposed super power empire
[3:34:38.840 --> 3:34:45.000]  of the globe and for some reason our neighbors to the north who have nowhere
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:51.720]  near our military might nowhere near you know our financial capacity supposedly
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:54.920]  and their money's worth more well don't worry they'll got our economy a little
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:58.400]  bit more they'll bring mexico's up and then all suddenly we'll all three have
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:35:01.960]  beyond parody and will be in our best interest to do with the securities and

[3:35:30.760 --> 3:35:35.560]  haven't they really benefited from it if it's not planned why did they just give
[3:35:35.560 --> 3:35:40.040]  them all the money with no one being able to look at the document to ever
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:42.680]  review it or to look at what they do with it
[3:35:42.680 --> 3:35:45.720]  i mean you're really trying to find all these big businesses and all these
[3:35:45.720 --> 3:35:49.720]  corporations oh it's not planned no no never you know it's just
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:54.040]  you know bad income yeah whatever yeah uh... i want to talk about who i'm
[3:35:54.040 --> 3:35:57.720]  voting for sure uh... this is gonna count sound
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:00.440]  kind of bad but i wanted to vote for uh...
[3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:05.560]  bar bar i don't think that's that bad luck for those that don't know uh... bob bar
[3:36:05.560 --> 3:36:09.960]  is a former uh... conservative republican congressman very neoconic
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:13.400]  uh... very neoconic buff first amendment and he's for the first amendment
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:17.400]  he's also for the second amendment he has done the alex joneshow before he says
[3:36:17.400 --> 3:36:20.680]  he's very well aware of the work i mean he's never come out for nine eleven
[3:36:20.680 --> 3:36:24.520]  truth or anything like that but he has taken an anti-war stance
[3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:27.800]  um... the only problem i have with bars he's very rigid
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:31.320]  and not a great speaker and one could argue that maybe
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:34.840]  sydney mckinney isn't the greatest speaker but she's much less rigid to me
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:38.440]  and she's not as mad voted for things like the patriot act but
[3:36:38.440 --> 3:36:42.360]  he built the whole campaign off fighting them really yeah yeah no yes i i've
[3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:44.280]  seen the campaign i mean you go watch the
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:46.520]  commercials on youtube i'm not gonna falter for that
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:50.520]  hey man to me if you're voting third party and you've gotten around the right
[3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:54.680]  left paradigm and you realize that even though bob bar is not going to be
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:57.960]  uh... become president uh... after the elections
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:01.560]  in a week you're doing the right thing you're trying to break the mold man and
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:06.120]  i hope i hope millions of us out there this year do it i i really would
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:08.920]  you know how we get this country back one in ten of us
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:11.640]  starts voting third party because it's not even one in ten
[3:37:11.640 --> 3:37:15.240]  you know i would say if definitely don't vote for the two main parties vote
[3:37:15.240 --> 3:37:17.880]  for ron paul i don't even care if you vote for something
[3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:21.160]  mckinney i don't agree with her most subjects well you know she's a gun
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:24.840]  grabber i'm with you there i mean you know i i like mckinney obviously you
[3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:27.640]  know every everybody i've run across i have problems with some of their
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:30.120]  positions you know there's no perfect candidate out there
[3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:33.960]  and then if i want the perfect candidate in my mind i mean and i'm far from
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:37.080]  perfect it's like well i better put it on myself to run and then i'll just get
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:41.400]  picked apart by everybody because lord knows i'm a human being you know none
[3:37:41.400 --> 3:37:44.760]  of us are perfect out there dan i thank you for the call i hope you do go out

[3:38:02.440 --> 3:38:05.960]  worst thing i mean not mo is it really gonna matter this year no other than
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:08.680]  us putting out numbers and saying you know we're sick of the system that's
[3:38:08.680 --> 3:38:11.560]  that's how it'll matter the jesse ventura shirt that says
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:14.760]  mccain obama none of the above none of the above is checked
[3:38:14.760 --> 3:38:18.920]  all right let's jump to mike in california what's up mike
[3:38:18.920 --> 3:38:23.160]  how you doing good man all right yes i have a quick question and i get
[3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:26.040]  another and also another question after this one
[3:38:26.040 --> 3:38:29.240]  but for people who live in urban environments if
[3:38:29.240 --> 3:38:31.960]  if they can't if they can't get to a rural environment in a
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:35.960]  martial law type situation what do you think are some of their best choices
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:40.440]  what are your best choices well i mean it's that's a you know in an urban
[3:38:40.440 --> 3:38:43.240]  environment that is tough i mean i often wonder
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:46.440]  if martial law ever comes to new york city what the people on long island are
[3:38:46.440 --> 3:38:49.480]  going to get are going to do because there's no way out other than the city
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:52.200]  you know none i mean there's waterways but you're not going to get very far i
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:54.200]  mean the navy will be out there quick coast guard
[3:38:54.200 --> 3:38:59.480]  they'll use all their resources i would say try to have a plan man try to
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:03.240]  know where perhaps a local airport is i know that there's a there's a couple
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:07.240]  strips of hay you think i'm joking try to have a helicopter's license man and
[3:39:07.240 --> 3:39:10.280]  have a friend i i don't know what to tell you you're not going to be able to
[3:39:10.280 --> 3:39:12.920]  jump into the sewers with your family and make your way out of the city you
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:15.720]  know what i'm saying i mean that's just not a reality
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:19.160]  you know i mean like everyone you know a lot of that but
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:22.840]  the everyone in the south or the southern states like texas and
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:25.720]  in those type of places like they have a better better handle on that sort of
[3:39:25.720 --> 3:39:29.160]  thing then oh absolutely well i mean even austin bro when you come down here
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:32.760]  i mean when i came down here you can walk into austin all right we're on the
[3:39:32.760 --> 3:39:35.640]  outskirts of of downtown austin you kind of oversee it
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:39.240]  but there are plenty of patty cabs in other words there's a ton of bike cabs
[3:39:39.240 --> 3:39:44.120]  and there everybody walks around here it even in a city of a million and more
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:46.600]  down there because it's developing and it's big
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:50.200]  it's small it's easy to get it ain't like being in manhattan traffic
[3:39:50.200 --> 3:39:53.560]  for an hour and a half and getting three blocks you know what i'm saying right
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:56.280]  because that is a nightmare just to get to the lincoln tunnel or over the
[3:39:56.280 --> 3:40:00.200]  george washington bridge i feel you man i mean all i could tell you is
[3:40:00.200 --> 3:40:04.040]  you know what you know what a way might be out get yourself a dirt bike
[3:40:04.040 --> 3:40:07.800]  or get yourself a motorcycle yeah i mean that's a great adventure yeah well
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:11.160]  adventure it might be your only way out
[3:40:11.160 --> 3:40:14.360]  i mean seriously because i know how it is to get out of new york city
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:17.480]  i mean you're you could literally be sitting in manhattan for one to two
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:20.520]  hours before you get over that bridge and then once you hit like you know the
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:22.440]  garden state parkway or something like that
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:25.960]  it's easy out if there's no traffic if there's a disaster
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:29.080]  or it's a weekend or a holiday weekend you should see the people trying to
[3:40:29.080 --> 3:40:31.880]  flood you could be in that traffic for three or four hours so
[3:40:31.880 --> 3:40:35.960]  you know what you know yeah go ahead oh because when i was younger
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:39.880]  you know i was in like i'll i won't say i was in the right but you know me
[3:40:39.880 --> 3:40:41.960]  you know when you're young you're driving around you want to see all this
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:44.840]  stuff going on buildings burning up on all that stuff and one of the things
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:49.000]  that i noticed is that the riots are kind of regulated to like the
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:52.920]  the ghetto you don't want you got to be on that point into nice and everybody
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:40:56.920]  had like certain places blocked off and then one went to reach the
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:41:01.640]  a certain point and the national guard came in and then they shot off the power
[3:41:01.640 --> 3:41:04.280]  and then that's what everything came to a halt
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:08.120]  yeah i mean i can't imagine i watched him on tv i thought they were wild
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:12.040]  um you know i hope that never happens in america again i i don't think that's
[3:41:12.040 --> 3:41:15.320]  this needs to be a country for riots unless it's for the right reasons and
[3:41:15.320 --> 3:41:19.000]  you know obviously it was messed up what happened around the king but you don't
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:24.680]  you don't go and riot in the streets to take you know television sets radios
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:28.840]  booze money jewelry if you're gonna riot about something right outside the
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:31.720]  courthouse and say the system's wrong or you go to dc
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:35.000]  and you you you make your point there i mean i wouldn't even say riot i'd say
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:38.840]  protest you said you had another you had another question mic
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:42.680]  oh well i was i was basically at this is to get your take on that because uh...
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:46.200]  you sound like a big city person yourself i mean it's interesting that you and
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:49.960]  and i accept my greater fun and mean that he's a you know he sounds like he
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:52.200]  sounds like it's something to get
[3:41:52.200 --> 3:41:56.360]  like city got you know i i hang out with a lot of city folks you know again i'm
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:41:59.480]  in upstate new york i'm in a college town most of my friends are from long
[3:41:59.480 --> 3:42:03.480]  island or queens of the bronx i go there once or twice a month but
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:07.160]  you know i i'm in the country myself and i can't imagine actually having to live
[3:42:07.160 --> 3:42:09.400]  in the city i like being in the city like
[3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:13.240]  maybe once a month for a few days even a week is too long for me because it's
[3:42:13.240 --> 3:42:16.120]  tough out there i think for the call mike i mean i
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:20.920]  if you never really spent an awful lot of time in an urban area it is so much
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:23.480]  different in a rural area and vice versa you know i
[3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:27.480]  some of these so these not even city cats but like people that are from duchess
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:31.000]  county or a few counties up from new york city that are you know still 90
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.640]  minutes from the city when they see where i live
[3:42:33.640 --> 3:42:37.720]  with amish folks and horse and buggy they just they can't even imagine it man
[3:42:37.720 --> 3:42:40.280]  that you mean there's not a shopping mall five minutes away from you
[3:42:40.280 --> 3:42:43.720]  well no actually there's not a shopping i gotta drive an hour to go to a mall
[3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:47.960]  what wait what do you do for fun not much i'm out in the cornfield most of the
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:51.800]  time all right let's jump to william in alabama
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:54.680]  william what's on your mind
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:43:00.120]  all right hello the master puppets are pulling strings
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:03.960]  all right mm-hmm did you have a big time my friend i mean even though the songs
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:06.760]  about cocaine who ships it in you know what i'm saying
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:10.680]  yeah you know it's time for an awakening here in america the bailout didn't help
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:14.600]  the american public and only the banks of whom have thrown the coup on the
[3:43:14.600 --> 3:43:19.000]  american public am i right oh absolutely i mean yo
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:23.640]  let's let's be real here this is now going to be not only a restructuring of
[3:43:23.640 --> 3:43:26.200]  the economic system when this is all said and done
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:29.000]  but it is really going to be a restructuring of the social system here
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:32.280]  at home because the banks are now going to be even further regulated by the
[3:43:32.280 --> 3:43:34.840]  government and if you can't pay your mortgage loan
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:38.040]  that is going to be government property forget about eminent domain
[3:43:38.040 --> 3:43:42.920]  again they'll be able to do mass land seizures and on top of that
[3:43:42.920 --> 3:43:45.960]  they'll be able to set up more bureaucracies so you don't lose your home
[3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:48.760]  so when the economy does go under they'll give you a choice they'll be like
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:43:51.320]  well you can always work for us on the weekends and they will give you a full
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:54.040]  time gig and we'll let you keep your house we'll just take it out of your
[3:43:54.040 --> 3:43:57.400]  paycheck every week your mortgage or your rent or whatever
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:00.760]  but you know they'll probably still put a clause in there where they own it so
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:05.080]  yeah this is a huge i mean it's a it's not even a silent coup i can't even
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:09.720]  call it a silent coup it's just a bloodless coup continue
[3:44:09.720 --> 3:44:12.680]  you know i mean it makes me nervous because it's like we're going into like
[3:44:12.680 --> 3:44:16.360]  what zimbabwe is right now what it what happens when it eventually happens i
[3:44:16.360 --> 3:44:18.760]  mean we're all going to be billionaires
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:22.520]  you know that billion dollars that we have nothing worth of what it was
[3:44:22.520 --> 3:44:26.040]  say 1904 when you know
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:29.800]  what was it for say so what today's dollar is oh yeah something like that yeah
[3:44:29.800 --> 3:44:32.680]  no i don't know what's going to happen you know again i
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:35.800]  it could end up in the 20s where you could have a barrel of greenbacks and
[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:38.360]  it ain't going to make a bit of difference that's why we have people
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:41.080]  like bob Chapman on here that's why we have tedi anderson on here
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:44.920]  if you have precious metals they will be worth something somewhere else
[3:44:44.920 --> 3:44:48.120]  even if the economy crashes here i thank you for the call william
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:53.160]  uh... let's jump to chris in florida chris what's on your mind
[3:44:53.160 --> 3:44:56.760]  yes i think that's one of the major reasons to stop drilling
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:00.840]  oil is that it's lubrication for the planet there are many studies that if
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:05.000]  you google earthquakes oil drilling and tsunami
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.440]  there are many university studies that show that there's a correlation between
[3:45:08.440 --> 3:45:11.240]  the oil drilling and uh... and the um...
[3:45:11.240 --> 3:45:15.400]  and amplitude and severity of the other well let me stop you there for a
[3:45:15.400 --> 3:45:19.000]  second you know everybody's always talking about we need to drill that
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:22.520]  like i had the governor on yesterday and he kind of ended with his peak oil
[3:45:22.520 --> 3:45:25.880]  theory that you know we're running out of oil we got to stop drilling there and
[3:45:25.880 --> 3:45:28.840]  now you're coming here and you're saying and i think in full agreement with you
[3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:31.320]  i don't think we need to drill for oil at all there
[3:45:31.320 --> 3:45:34.600]  plenty of alternative methods of energy here's the problem it's never going to
[3:45:34.600 --> 3:45:38.280]  happen because they literally have a sick monopoly
[3:45:38.280 --> 3:45:41.960]  on the oil fields right today guys nationally
[3:45:41.960 --> 3:45:46.120]  gas is at a three-year low at two dollars and fifty nine cents
[3:45:46.120 --> 3:45:49.480]  think about that at two sixty that's a three-year low
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:53.880]  and as soon as they got their oil fields in afghanistan and their pipelines
[3:45:53.880 --> 3:45:56.760]  through there in iraq and their their oil their
[3:45:56.760 --> 3:45:59.880]  their oil and afghanistan and iraq and basically
[3:45:59.880 --> 3:46:02.680]  took over the majority of the supply they're already buddy buddy with saudi
[3:46:02.680 --> 3:46:05.800]  arabia they jack the price up so how are we ever
[3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:10.120]  going to get away from oil well you have to prosecute the criminals at the top
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:13.240]  and then you have to take their resources and split them up you can't let
[3:46:13.240 --> 3:46:16.360]  them have these sick monopolies and only by doing that
[3:46:16.360 --> 3:46:19.160]  are we ever going to bring in alternative methods of energy
[3:46:19.160 --> 3:46:23.240]  so i mean i mean i'm just saying how are we going to do it how are we going to
[3:46:23.240 --> 3:46:26.840]  stop these cartels who literally have billions and trillions of dollars at
[3:46:26.840 --> 3:46:31.080]  their disposal and i mean oil not only not only
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:35.080]  does it is it our gas and we need it for that but it i mean your dvds are made
[3:46:35.080 --> 3:46:38.120]  out of oil you know hard most of our products are made
[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:41.640]  out of oil it's it is literally one of the biggest life forces out here and
[3:46:41.640 --> 3:46:45.320]  yes they're all our alternatives but how do we break the monopoly chris
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:49.080]  i didn't say to break the monopoly well i think that that is part of it of course
[3:46:49.080 --> 3:46:52.440]  but uh... you know not maybe not directly of course if each of us take
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:56.440]  another stance and alternative energy would be nice if we were like the
[3:46:56.440 --> 3:46:58.920]  german government subsidizing those who
[3:46:58.920 --> 3:47:03.720]  who decide to invest in in a renewable like solar or wind power well i would
[3:47:03.720 --> 3:47:07.160]  also say let's take it a little bit further let's let's start
[3:47:07.160 --> 3:47:10.680]  taking it upon ourselves to bring solar energy to our homes i mean
[3:47:10.680 --> 3:47:13.400]  there's got to be a small businessman out there
[3:47:13.400 --> 3:47:16.440]  that that's got a lot of motivation to make a big business out of it because
[3:47:16.440 --> 3:47:19.320]  they don't want you to use solar energy because solar energy
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:23.160]  is free after you buy the equipment you know the sun's going to be around folks
[3:47:23.160 --> 3:47:26.760]  it's it's going to be there and that's why you haven't seen any of that
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:30.600]  you know it's just like you ever see who killed the electric car
[3:47:30.600 --> 3:47:33.800]  oh yeah i did but i'm saying that we need to make a choice
[3:47:33.800 --> 3:47:39.720]  to to save the earth uh... stability no no i i agree there man but i let me
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:43.800]  put it to you this way like we push for the electric car for many many years
[3:47:43.800 --> 3:47:46.360]  finally it gets made there's some new models out now
[3:47:46.360 --> 3:47:50.360]  but like the initial electric car they leased it to you they didn't let you
[3:47:50.360 --> 3:47:53.960]  own it and then when the buyer the guy said well we want the we want to buy it
[3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:57.160]  from the least they said no and they went and grabbed it and they crushed it
[3:47:57.160 --> 3:48:00.040]  i'm just saying it is going to be awfully hard
[3:48:00.040 --> 3:48:03.400]  awfully hard to ever break any of these monopolies especially the oil monopoly
[3:48:03.400 --> 3:48:07.400]  and i see your concerns there with the environmental impact with tsunamis like
[3:48:07.400 --> 3:48:11.320]  you said earthquakes disrupting and you know the
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:15.480]  the earth's natural balance by taking this stuff
[3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:18.600]  but these guys aren't worried about the earth's natural balance except for when
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:21.320]  they're you know doing their little pagan occult rituals i thank you for the
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:26.920]  call chris let's go to reese in texas reese what's popping

[3:49:19.240 --> 3:49:21.320]  quite a common it was quite a
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:25.320]  i got a transition you know now that is quite a transition and well i i would

[3:57:22.840 --> 3:57:25.160]  of listeners are probably frustrated with the same issue
[3:57:25.160 --> 3:57:28.520]  i find that when i'm trying to wake people up
[3:57:28.520 --> 3:57:32.600]  my closest family are often the hardest to convince all right let me stop you
[3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:35.080]  because i hear the music and i gotta agree with you
[3:57:35.080 --> 3:57:38.760]  and you know i had comments from my stepfather
[3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:42.120]  you know jason i just don't want to walk in one day and all the sudden you
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:45.720]  got a jar full of heroes and formaldehyde and i'm like what are you talking
