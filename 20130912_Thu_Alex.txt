[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:09.790]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.912]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:17.115]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.218]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:51.113]  I want to welcome all of our listeners listening across the planet, from London, England, to Moscow, Russia, to New York, New York, here in the United States, to folks listening to us right here in my hometown, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:56.676]  I guess my hometown's really Dallas, but my adopted hometown of Austin, Texas.
[00:00:56.676 --> 00:01:03.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, the 12th day of September,
[00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:10.043]  2013 and we are going to be taking your phone calls today.
[00:01:10.043 --> 00:01:30.334]  We have the father of the friend that lifted weights with Tamerlan Czarnev who was executed by an FBI death squad at his home if he's not threatened to not come on by the time he's scheduled like the mother and the aunt and
[00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:34.920]  Everybody else, then he will be with us on the broadcast.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:44.271]  The mother and the aunt of, and the father of the Czarnev brothers themselves threatened not to come on my show because the government's so loving.
[00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.213]  And then the intel we have is that
[00:01:48.581 --> 00:02:05.893]  Mr. Totoshev's son was executed because basically Tamerlan had bragged to him that he was working for the CIA in super-secret operations in the Caucasus.
[00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:07.894]  That's the intel we got early on.
[00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.996]  I predicted they would hunt down their friends and kill them.
[00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:14.509]  They were absolute patsies that took part in the drill.
[00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:19.456]  There is uncontrovertible masses of triangulated evidence.
[00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:25.883]  Where each piece of the evidence doesn't prove it, but you triangulate them and lay them over, it's all there.
[00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:33.509]  The drill, the stand-down, the older brother working for a CIA-sponsored program out of Georgetown University under Brzezinski.
[00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.552]  The uncle being connected to CIA.
[00:02:36.552 --> 00:02:42.076]  The brother's not worried, partying the night before, screaming at police, we didn't do it.
[00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:44.958]  The cops being killed, turned out not by them, they didn't rob a 7-Eleven.
[00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:46.969]  On and on and on.
[00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:48.930]  Them trying to kill him in the boat.
[00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.971]  He's pled not guilty.
[00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.091]  You never really hear that in the news.
[00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:54.773]  And I've talked to the family.
[00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:58.674]  The older brother was being inducted into the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:00.555]  You know all those TV ads you see?
[00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:01.956]  Come join the CIA!
[00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:06.197]  They advertise it in Time Magazine for kids and in shows.
[00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:09.919]  They're recruiting people at 18 while they're in college.
[00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:14.003]  And this is what they do to them.
[00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:22.148]  And the guys were into boxing, they were wearing sunglasses, they were wearing, you know, designer clothes, driving around in fancy cars.
[00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:26.611]  Where'd all the money come from?
[00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:29.172]  The intel I've got, well, I'm not even going to get into it.
[00:03:29.172 --> 00:03:33.955]  We're going to find out exactly why the FBI, he said, they're coming to kill me.
[00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:35.376]  They're coming to kill me.
[00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:40.820]  He gets there, they put him in a chair, shoot him in the back of the head.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.000]  So,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.662]  Rene Totoshev is going to be joining us on the broadcast.
[00:03:46.662 --> 00:03:49.804]  I thought we had the wife or the father on.
[00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:51.605]  Is it the wife or the father?
[00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:53.586]  So it's the wife coming on.
[00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.526]  I thought it was the dads.
[00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.707]  We're looking at both of them?
[00:03:57.008 --> 00:03:57.768]  Oh, it's just the wife.
[00:03:57.768 --> 00:03:58.829]  Okay.
[00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.289]  Up until yesterday, I wasn't exactly sure which one.
[00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:05.531]  So, that is going to be, the mother will be coming on.
[00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:08.212]  We're also working on getting the father on as well.
[00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:11.433]  That's why that's still up in the air right up until the last minute.
[00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:16.835]  We've been talking to him off and on and some of the other families since it happened, basically, within a week or so.
[00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:27.709]  And that's why the media got upset, the controlled media, the establishment state-run media, and basically came after me.
[00:04:27.709 --> 00:04:31.890]  And now they've said on MSNBC and other places that I'm actually behind the bombing.
[00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.411]  See, I point out the globalists are behind it, so their answer is, no, you're behind it.
[00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.852]  Now who do you think is behind it?
[00:04:38.852 --> 00:04:40.272]  Alex Jones or the establishment?
[00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:46.755]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I don't have Superman powers like the New World Order with its trillions of dollars.
[00:04:46.755 --> 00:04:49.417]  All right, Putin has written an open letter to the American people.
[00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:50.497]  That's coming up.
[00:04:50.497 --> 00:04:57.602]  Huge developments as the deal goes forward for Syria to give up its weapons, derailing their attempts for now to start World War III.
[00:04:57.602 --> 00:04:58.022]  We'll be back.
[00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:04.118]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[00:05:04.118 --> 00:05:09.640]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.362]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:05:17.362 --> 00:05:26.484]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:05:26.664 --> 00:05:33.850]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.471]  All of this is happening so fast.
[00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.712]  You need to be ahead of the game.
[00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:42.677]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:05:43.377 --> 00:05:43.897]  War.
[00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:45.198]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:05:45.198 --> 00:05:46.519]  Another plane just hit!
[00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.619]  State of Mind.
[00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:49.180]  Because there's a war on.
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.200]  For your mind.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.402]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:54.402 --> 00:05:59.465]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[00:06:00.382 --> 00:06:14.150]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:24.457]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:29.760]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:39.706]  For many who are new to silver, that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays.
[00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:40.807]  I think so.
[00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.775]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:09.598]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:07:09.598 --> 00:07:13.021]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:16.464]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:07:16.464 --> 00:07:23.090]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.533]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:07:27.173 --> 00:07:38.577]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making a supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:43.539]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:52.183]  To find out more information on how Supernatural Silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens, go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[00:07:52.183 --> 00:07:54.905]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:23.891]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:26.712]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:38.917]  Blasting out worldwide from deep in the heart of Texas, I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours, Lord willing.
[00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:44.639]  René Totechev, the mother of the man executed, the wife
[00:08:45.635 --> 00:09:07.868]  I tell you, this show today, there's so much news breaking, so much happening, so much unfolding that we're also very close to getting the Czarnev brothers' mother on the show, and the father and the mother of Toda Chef.
[00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:11.670]  But that is coming up in the third hour.
[00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:27.138]  Of the broadcast today, Lou Rockwell's going to be popping in for 30 minutes, coming up in the next hour to give us his take on what's happening worldwide and where he sees Western civilization at this point.
[00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:33.919]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:36.140]  until 2 p.m.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.101]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:47.445]  We come back weeknights, 7 o'clock Central, with the InfoWars Nightly News and myself and the rest of my anchors and crew here from Austin, Texas.
[00:09:47.445 --> 00:09:47.945]  Wow!
[00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:50.907]  There is so much I want to get into today, obviously.
[00:09:50.907 --> 00:09:54.688]  The Supreme Court is going to be hearing
[00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:19.656]  Testimony, and it's set to rule down the road, on the National Defense Authorization Act, where the government claims the power to take you away to the dungeon, take you away for torture, take you away with no charges, no one even knows where you went, basically something right out of the Byzantine Empire, right out of the Dark Ages, right out of Nazi Germany.
[00:10:20.632 --> 00:10:37.043]  And that's why we're going to be getting the family on in the next few weeks, including today, of people, the families that have had their family members disappear and have had their family members shot in the back of the head by agents of the New World Order masquerading as federal agents.
[00:10:40.425 --> 00:10:53.732]  of Ibrahim Todeshev, a man shot in the top of the head by FBI in Florida during his questioning about his relationship with Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the eldest of the two supposed Boston bombers.
[00:10:53.732 --> 00:10:56.953]  And so that is going to be coming up later.
[00:10:56.953 --> 00:10:59.294]  And we're also going to try to get his mother and father on.
[00:10:59.294 --> 00:11:03.396]  And again, the mother and the father of the Tsarnaev brothers.
[00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:08.699]  The problem is we've had them all ready to come on, including the aunt and in the past.
[00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:13.214]  And literally, okay, you're coming on the night, on the nightly news?
[00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:17.194]  In fact, we taped this once with the aunt.
[00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:20.995]  And then she calls back crying and just says, I love my children.
[00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:22.475]  I'm not going to sacrifice them.
[00:11:22.475 --> 00:11:24.416]  Fine, evil is winning.
[00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:27.856]  I will not let the evil get my son.
[00:11:27.856 --> 00:11:28.876]  Fine, evil wins.
[00:11:28.876 --> 00:11:30.497]  Please don't kill me.
[00:11:30.497 --> 00:11:32.397]  Talking to the people listening on the phone.
[00:11:32.397 --> 00:11:36.438]  I mean, that's how incredible this type of stuff is.
[00:11:36.438 --> 00:11:38.758]  And by the way, they'll come to your house and shoot you in the back of the head.
[00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:43.596]  And then say that they were wounded, and then it turned out, oh, we weren't wounded, he didn't even assault us.
[00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:45.797]  And then they just declare national security.
[00:11:45.797 --> 00:11:48.758]  I mean, will they come to my house, shoot me in the back of the head?
[00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:54.400]  While I'm tied down in a chair?
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.102]  And then that'll just be the end of it?
[00:11:57.102 --> 00:12:07.086]  So this is the NDAA, and this is what they do to people that find out about Cameron Lanzarnev working for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:12:09.517 --> 00:12:21.124]  They send an FBI hit squad to your house to tie you down in a chair and shoot you right in the back and the top of the head, just right where the head curves back over towards the back.
[00:12:21.124 --> 00:12:21.605]  Boom!
[00:12:21.605 --> 00:12:23.726]  Never saw it coming, did you?
[00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:27.969]  Absolutely, devastatingly disgusting.
[00:12:27.969 --> 00:12:35.073]  So, that is the tyranny that we live under, and that is the peril that we're all in.
[00:12:35.073 --> 00:12:37.595]  And once evil like this gets rolling,
[00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:41.381]  It's very hard to stop it.
[00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:55.271]  The good news is people not just in America but worldwide are waking up to this evil and are starting to find their courage because you should all be afraid of letting the tyrants get control.
[00:12:55.271 --> 00:13:01.456]  You should all be concerned about them successfully intimidating everybody and taking over.
[00:13:01.456 --> 00:13:05.099]  Then the long dark winter comes.
[00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:07.601]  Then the great tyranny comes.
[00:13:09.153 --> 00:13:13.175]  Then, the true persecution begins.
[00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:21.939]  If you listen to what Alexander Schultz and Eatson said, will you guys print me the, oh, how we burned in the camps, Alexander Schultz and Eatson, good luck, archipelago quote?
[00:13:21.939 --> 00:13:23.299]  Thank you so much.
[00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:33.424]  I want to actually read that on air today instead of just paraphrasing it.
[00:13:33.424 --> 00:13:35.325]  I'll be honest with you right now.
[00:13:37.049 --> 00:13:51.653]  I am so blown away by the magnitude of what is historically happening worldwide, the good, the bad, and the ugly, that Chris Jordan, right before the show started, said, man, you seem flustered today.
[00:13:51.653 --> 00:13:56.314]  You seem upset today.
[00:13:56.314 --> 00:14:00.715]  You seem like something's wrong.
[00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.656]  And he's absolutely right.
[00:14:02.656 --> 00:14:03.736]  The magnitude
[00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:09.892]  Of how good things are going.
[00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:12.553]  The magnitude of how bad things are going.
[00:14:12.553 --> 00:14:28.778]  The sheer scale of how serious this is and how real this all is and how right I've been for 18 years studying history and then overlaying it in human patterns with what was currently happening and then projecting into the future.
[00:14:29.892 --> 00:14:33.793]  But so much of it is just put in white papers by the establishment themselves.
[00:14:33.793 --> 00:14:47.458]  But to come to grips with the fact that A, the plan is real, and it's really happening, and we're living in a nightmare science fiction movie, but B, and I think probably even more important, the animating contest of liberty is igniting
[00:14:48.652 --> 00:15:10.136]  Brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and liberty is rising in the face of this tyranny, and it's so incredible to be alive here at this time and this juncture, and then to get advice by a lot of really high-powered media people.
[00:15:10.136 --> 00:15:11.656]  Off-record.
[00:15:11.656 --> 00:15:13.357]  Off-record, you know, who those people are.
[00:15:13.357 --> 00:15:14.977]  It's always off-record.
[00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:47.564]  That InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, this radio show, what I do with my team and with you the listeners who are all part of the team, all out there trying to awaken people, is being viewed and listened to intensely from Japan to Russia to England to France to South Africa to Israel to Mexico to Brazil to Chile to China
[00:15:49.093 --> 00:15:52.135]  To Indonesia.
[00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:55.737]  To the highest councils of government.
[00:15:55.737 --> 00:15:59.099]  And this is what I get from many different high-powered sources.
[00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.862]  And we can see, I show my writers, look at the IP addresses of the media.
[00:16:02.862 --> 00:16:06.484]  Not just the NSA, not just the FBI, not just the CIA.
[00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:10.206]  I don't mean I get hundreds of visits from those each agencies.
[00:16:10.206 --> 00:16:12.228]  We get thousands of visits a day.
[00:16:13.757 --> 00:16:22.062]  From the NSA, the CIA, thousands a day from ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, all their affiliates.
[00:16:22.062 --> 00:16:23.463]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:16:23.463 --> 00:16:28.626]  The whole world watching what we're doing right now.
[00:16:28.626 --> 00:16:34.029]  And I don't mean a lot of the masses out there working 15 hours a day and going home and watching football.
[00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:38.291]  I mean the media, the governments, the Pentagon.
[00:16:38.291 --> 00:16:41.313]  And to go out on the street and walk by troops and half of them
[00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:45.250]  On average, come over and shake my hand.
[00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.612]  And you've heard the callers say, you know, that's about who's awake and who's listening.
[00:16:48.612 --> 00:17:02.402]  And to learn about the highest levels of media focusing on what we do, and governments, and to now go to a rock and roll concert, and there are people all over the place wearing Infowars shirts, a lot of them that aren't even ours.
[00:17:06.048 --> 00:17:25.316]  And to then not have every 10th person I walked by come over and shake my hand, but to have like, you know, first 5 people, then 10, then 20, to where you actually get scared, because I've been in these crowds before when 100 of them pile up, and then 200, it's like rugby, they're about to crush you, and I had to literally run backstage because so many of my listeners were there.
[00:17:25.987 --> 00:17:28.288]  And that's not me up there saying, oh, I'm a narcissist.
[00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:29.609]  Oh, we're so big.
[00:17:29.609 --> 00:17:31.750]  It's a radar ping.
[00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.992]  It's a radar ping or sonar ping on man.
[00:17:35.992 --> 00:17:36.573]  Wow.
[00:17:36.573 --> 00:17:41.556]  And we're just one part of the resistance, the responsibility of that.
[00:17:41.556 --> 00:17:43.016]  I can hardly do the show.
[00:17:43.016 --> 00:17:45.598]  I mean, I'm not getting psyched out or anything.
[00:17:45.598 --> 00:17:49.620]  But when I really start thinking about.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.202]  Millions of people every hour listening and then who's listening?
[00:17:55.697 --> 00:17:59.019]  And then you ask yourself, why me?
[00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:03.482]  Why are people... And the answer is, I did an old-fashioned thing.
[00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:05.363]  I didn't listen to mainstream media.
[00:18:05.363 --> 00:18:10.726]  I studied history, and I read white papers, and I watched C-SPAN, and I read... Let's not exaggerate.
[00:18:11.793 --> 00:18:14.174]  150, 200 books, I don't know, on World War II alone.
[00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:15.755]  100 on British naval history.
[00:18:15.755 --> 00:18:20.838]  I mean, I got a dick, I don't even have time to read anymore because all of this work, but I used to read every night until like 2, 3 in the morning.
[00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:22.579]  My wife would be like, good God, do you ever sleep?
[00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.660]  Kind of went through a phase of that as well.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.101]  And I just, what humans have done in the past, they do again and again.
[00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:29.482]  And I didn't discover that.
[00:18:29.482 --> 00:18:30.563]  Everybody knows that.
[00:18:30.563 --> 00:18:33.904]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:38.326]  I know what they're going to do because I've studied history and I read their own white papers.
[00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:41.028]  And then you figure out most of these governments and people don't.
[00:18:42.594 --> 00:18:58.651]  Most of the media, they just repeat the talking points that come down the chain, and then you start realizing that most people, even who are very intelligent, they want to go play golf, they want to go see their girlfriend, they want to go to the art.
[00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.451]  They want to go to the opera.
[00:19:02.451 --> 00:19:04.892]  They want to go to the NASCAR race.
[00:19:04.892 --> 00:19:06.532]  They want to go fishing.
[00:19:06.532 --> 00:19:07.933]  And I don't blame them.
[00:19:07.933 --> 00:19:15.976]  I guess it's that I'm focused, at least most of the time, so much so that I don't even function at a good level, on what's happening.
[00:19:15.976 --> 00:19:18.997]  I can't do... I dream about this stuff.
[00:19:18.997 --> 00:19:21.838]  I'm in the shower thinking about it.
[00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:23.079]  I can't shut it off.
[00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:43.238]  And before I come back and go to all the news and your phone calls and these guests, it's just I'm here telling you that it's so overwhelming and I had a total, another level of epiphany this morning about the nature of the power structure and where we are historically in the world.
[00:19:43.238 --> 00:19:45.980]  And I'm going to tell you about that when we come back briefly and then get into all the news.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:53.204]  But I want to tell you where we are right now, worldwide, and where things are going.
[00:19:54.005 --> 00:19:57.428]  If we decide it's going to go in a good direction, we will.
[00:19:57.428 --> 00:20:04.735]  If we don't decide, we're going down.
[00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:09.819]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break-in this year.
[00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:11.901]  Burglars call it smash and grab.
[00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:13.182]  Police call it robbery.
[00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.984]  We call it avoidable.
[00:20:15.984 --> 00:20:22.009]  We are Fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:27.434]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:33.459]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:41.683]  At only $29.95, Fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[00:20:41.683 --> 00:20:45.444]  Order your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to Faketv.com.

[00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:49.086]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:04.798]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:07.922]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:21:07.922 --> 00:21:13.470]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.093]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:17.034]  We are what we eat.
[00:21:17.034 --> 00:21:21.718]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:25.922]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[00:21:25.922 --> 00:21:28.484]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:21:28.484 --> 00:21:34.729]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:23:51.093 --> 00:23:52.054]  Pro-EM1, the raw probiotic.
[00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:19.030]  Alright, here's the bottom line I'm trying to break down for you.
[00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.715]  Liberty is extremely popular.
[00:24:22.715 --> 00:24:25.258]  And the only reason InfoWars is so popular
[00:24:27.408 --> 00:24:30.930]  And the radio show is that people are waking up.
[00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:41.437]  It's not even so much that we're waking them up, that they're already waking up and just taking their awareness to a higher level by finding this radio broadcast.
[00:24:41.437 --> 00:24:51.283]  They're only hearing things here that they already basically already knew, but it's allowing people to know that there's a wider resistance.
[00:24:51.283 --> 00:24:54.325]  That's what I'm trying to get at here.
[00:24:54.325 --> 00:24:55.245]  And now I see
[00:24:56.448 --> 00:25:12.825]  Fleets of people joining the ranks of what has been called the alternative or grassroots media and really giving the establishment, not a run for its money, but bringing it down.
[00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:15.628]  And we are the real media.
[00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:18.412]  This is the born-again media.
[00:25:18.412 --> 00:25:22.715]  Because there hasn't been a real media for 50, 60 years in this country to a great extent.
[00:25:22.715 --> 00:25:33.643]  There's been people following party lines, put out by think tanks, put out by government, put out by the major networks that are on record having their news packaged by psych warfare chiefs.
[00:25:33.643 --> 00:25:37.046]  That's all declassified now.
[00:25:37.046 --> 00:25:38.487]  Because before it was illegal.
[00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:39.447]  They were doing it secretly.
[00:25:39.447 --> 00:25:40.948]  Now it's public.
[00:25:40.948 --> 00:25:41.409]  And so,
[00:25:44.013 --> 00:25:46.817]  The mainstream media is dead.
[00:25:46.817 --> 00:25:50.521]  It's not dying, it's dead.
[00:25:50.521 --> 00:25:54.827]  And they, narcissistically, have not even figured that out yet.
[00:25:54.827 --> 00:25:57.831]  They're still, to a great extent, in their own world.
[00:25:59.648 --> 00:26:01.568]  Thinking that they're running the show.
[00:26:01.568 --> 00:26:19.852]  They realize they're losing influence, they realize they've got to change, but they still instinctively, because they're narcissists, are into the imaginary world that they are these, you know, TV movie stars, these new celebrities, because they got into it to be new celebrities.
[00:26:19.852 --> 00:26:26.274]  And so they're like a little local band that has a hundred people that come out to see it every Saturday night who think they're celebrities.
[00:26:27.182 --> 00:26:36.987]  They think with their 400,000 viewers on Piers Morgan, what used to be 10 million a decade ago, in that same time slot, he really thinks he's a big star.
[00:26:36.987 --> 00:26:48.313]  And the rest of the dinosaur media sits there and props each other up in a big vanity fair, Emperor's New Clothes, and together, sharing their little bit of draining power, they still
[00:26:49.622 --> 00:26:53.525]  Have a glint of what they had, but it's a fading spark.
[00:26:53.525 --> 00:26:55.427]  It's burning out right now.
[00:26:55.427 --> 00:26:56.708]  They're dead.
[00:26:56.708 --> 00:27:04.554]  Let me announce to you, and I've talked to a lot of the top media people in the world, folks, and they concur.
[00:27:04.554 --> 00:27:12.801]  It is undoubted, rout of the establishment, rout of the New World Order, rout of their propaganda arms.
[00:27:12.801 --> 00:27:14.262]  We are the media.
[00:27:14.262 --> 00:27:16.143]  We are not the alternative media.
[00:27:16.143 --> 00:27:17.785]  We're not humble bloggers.
[00:27:19.218 --> 00:27:20.458]  That's what I'm always telling my crew.
[00:27:20.458 --> 00:27:31.402]  Don't be on a power trip, but realize how historical this is, and really get dialed into the info, and with the cutting edge of what's happening.
[00:27:31.402 --> 00:27:35.784]  Don't just think of ourselves as podunk because we're in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:35.784 --> 00:27:41.966]  We're here because we don't want to be influenced by New York, or influenced by DC, or influenced by Los Angeles.
[00:27:41.966 --> 00:27:45.887]  We don't want to be influenced by that failing, sinking Titanic.
[00:27:45.887 --> 00:27:47.388]  We're not on that ship.
[00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:54.918]  And the manifestation of all this as the real media is resurrected.
[00:27:54.918 --> 00:27:56.119]  It's back from the dead.
[00:27:56.119 --> 00:27:59.582]  Back to the muckrakers of a hundred years ago.
[00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:01.204]  Souped up by high-tech systems.
[00:28:01.204 --> 00:28:04.666]  And if talk radio would figure that out, it wouldn't be imploding.
[00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:05.287]  And it is.
[00:28:05.287 --> 00:28:12.473]  The only shows surviving now are getting hardcore, are libertarian, are anti-New World Order, are talking about false flag.
[00:28:12.473 --> 00:28:13.694]  All the shows now.
[00:28:13.694 --> 00:28:16.136]  Beck, Limbaugh, every single one of them.
[00:28:17.096 --> 00:28:19.837]  The first to really start doing this was Savage a decade ago.
[00:28:19.837 --> 00:28:22.398]  That's why I like Savage, because he's so smart.
[00:28:22.398 --> 00:28:26.260]  The other guys, it's more talking points, more Republican bills.
[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:27.341]  Beck is smart enough.
[00:28:27.341 --> 00:28:32.263]  He's completely jumping ship out of that, because the ship is sinking, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:35.442]  And that's the thing about liberty.
[00:28:35.442 --> 00:28:46.247]  People always expect we're just losers, we're gonna fail, tyranny's destined to win, there's nothing we can do, it's written in the Bible with some New World Order, Rockefeller World Council of Churches interpretation.
[00:28:46.247 --> 00:28:47.608]  No!
[00:28:47.608 --> 00:28:49.729]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:28:49.729 --> 00:28:58.473]  God gave reprieves to Israel, and reprieves to Nineveh, and reprieves over and over again in history if they turned from their wicked ways.
[00:28:58.473 --> 00:28:59.434]  If they hit their knees,
[00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.877]  Ask for forgiveness and seek the face of God.
[00:29:03.877 --> 00:29:06.602]  Maybe you don't believe in a physical God.
[00:29:06.602 --> 00:29:09.386]  What about innocence and your children?
[00:29:09.386 --> 00:29:14.154]  If you don't see God in the innocence of your children, as they say on the road with Viggo Mortensen.
[00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:17.911]  Then you don't have any discernment.
[00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:24.536]  If you don't see God in the stars and the clouds every day, I'm just struck down by the beauty every day.
[00:29:24.536 --> 00:29:29.921]  Driving home last night with the sunset and clouds and the cobalt blue sky.
[00:29:29.921 --> 00:29:31.642]  I mean, it was just enraptured.
[00:29:32.503 --> 00:29:33.504]  Buy it.
[00:29:33.504 --> 00:29:34.944]  That is the revolution.
[00:29:34.944 --> 00:29:46.950]  Recognizing beauty and not getting sucked into the ugliness of the mainstream dying media that's trying to disease your mind with psych warfare viruses so that you think you need them.
[00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.751]  We'll be back.
[00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:51.131]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:53.673]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.673 --> 00:29:56.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.744 --> 00:31:03.846]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:11.874]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:31:11.874 --> 00:31:16.819]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:31:16.819 --> 00:31:18.721]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:31:19.542 --> 00:31:22.383]  One of us who can, will take care of ourselves.
[00:31:22.383 --> 00:31:25.385]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[00:33:12.203 --> 00:33:15.785]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:15.785 --> 00:33:19.947]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:31.082]  Ladies and gentlemen, in short, the Syria news is big.
[00:33:31.082 --> 00:33:32.662]  Obama caught lying.
[00:33:32.662 --> 00:33:36.803]  Wall Street Journal kind of snuck the story out last night.
[00:33:36.803 --> 00:33:39.324]  Lois Lerner targeting tea parties.
[00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:42.185]  They're still targeting tea parties with the IRS.
[00:33:42.185 --> 00:33:43.605]  This is terrorism.
[00:33:43.605 --> 00:33:45.746]  This is absolutely impeachable.
[00:33:45.746 --> 00:33:50.467]  Even Piers Morgan had to say this is tyranny and that now he understands why people
[00:33:51.187 --> 00:33:52.887]  Think we're in danger?
[00:33:52.887 --> 00:33:53.448]  Absolutely!
[00:33:53.448 --> 00:34:03.430]  Tyranny isn't a joke, folks, giving into corruption, because it'll just grow and grow and grow until the worst of the worst are at the center of it.
[00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:09.031]  And the point I'm telling you here is, the tipping point is now in sight.
[00:34:09.031 --> 00:34:15.392]  We haven't gotten completely over the event horizon yet, but we're now in it.
[00:34:15.392 --> 00:34:18.053]  Just like turbulence, when you start getting ready to go into a storm in a jet,
[00:34:19.504 --> 00:34:24.849]  I mean, the house is a-rockin', ladies and gentlemen, and don't bother knockin'.
[00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:27.491]  As Stevie Ray Vaughan would say.
[00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:29.273]  Come on in.
[00:34:29.273 --> 00:34:32.035]  Because it's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:32.035 --> 00:34:32.976]  That's what I tell my crew.
[00:34:32.976 --> 00:34:35.438]  I say, listen, this is a war.
[00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:40.363]  And you're taking a job here at a place where if the enemy wins, you better run to another country.
[00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:52.736]  I tell people that come to work here, this isn't a game, it isn't a joke, we're not looking out the blinds, we're not afraid, we're just up front, 110%, we're in this fight.
[00:34:52.736 --> 00:34:56.920]  And I have to remember that myself, how real this is.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:08.330]  Most of the rich people I know, and I mean really rich people, worth hundreds of millions, billions of dollars, and I know a lot of them, a lot of them live here in Austin or dead, they have left the United States.
[00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.711]  And I've explained this to you.
[00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:20.490]  The globalists figured out about five years ago that they'd set in motion an economic collapse to consolidate power, but their own people got greedy and overdid it.
[00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:30.697]  It's kind of like guys loading artillery and setting the detonators on the mortars and dropping one and blowing themselves up.
[00:35:30.697 --> 00:35:33.819]  That's basically what the globalists have already done.
[00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:37.202]  But five years in the political time span,
[00:35:38.689 --> 00:35:41.912]  And in the time span of humanity is like seconds.
[00:35:41.912 --> 00:35:44.354]  So they dropped the mortar.
[00:35:44.354 --> 00:35:47.676]  They didn't tell you they dropped the mortar.
[00:35:47.676 --> 00:35:48.457]  And they're running.
[00:35:48.457 --> 00:35:49.978]  They already ran out the door.
[00:35:49.978 --> 00:35:58.085]  And that mortar is now beginning to touch down on the ground, on the concrete, and is about to explode, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:58.902 --> 00:36:16.290]  That's why they're digging in with armed guards and militarizing police and shutting up helicopter launch pads with nerve gas in them for the American people and running around and the French socialists are saying, we'll get our economy going, we're going to launch robot assembly lines first and replace people!
[00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.671]  See, the singularity is starting to happen, basically.
[00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:28.676]  But it's a singularity designed as anti-human by the globalists to checkmate all their competition, and in the process they've destroyed themselves.
[00:36:28.676 --> 00:36:34.059]  Because that's the thing, you don't ever destroy your neighbor and in the end get away with it.
[00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:42.423]  Because the spirit of destroying your neighbor wrongfully, when they've not done anything to you, is a spirit that isn't going to stop with your neighbor.
[00:36:42.423 --> 00:36:43.824]  Now you're going to destroy your own people.
[00:36:45.572 --> 00:36:47.313]  You're gonna destroy your own family.
[00:36:47.313 --> 00:36:51.515]  You don't let that demon out of the bottle, and then it just goes away.
[00:36:51.515 --> 00:36:58.539]  It doesn't just stop having a hunger, it's hunger gets stronger!
[00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:00.940]  So, here is the bottom line.
[00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:09.406]  You are living in the middle of a historical meltdown of biblical proportions.
[00:37:09.406 --> 00:37:11.368]  There's a lot of great opportunities in it.
[00:37:11.368 --> 00:37:13.109]  There's a lot of pitfalls in it.
[00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:16.613]  And the future destiny of humanity is now being decided.
[00:37:16.613 --> 00:37:17.754]  And I can declare to you...
[00:37:19.076 --> 00:37:22.498]  Not from my own perspective, but from many other people's in history.
[00:37:22.498 --> 00:37:26.681]  The establishment is a dead fish.
[00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:30.903]  It's on the side of the river, bloated and stinking.
[00:37:30.903 --> 00:37:33.865]  And we can dress it up, put perfume on it all day.
[00:37:33.865 --> 00:37:35.066]  It's rotting.
[00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:36.006]  It's rotting fast.
[00:37:36.006 --> 00:37:45.712]  You know, Putin came out and said that it's extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional
[00:37:48.211 --> 00:37:52.655]  And a Democratic Senator says he wants to vomit over it.
[00:37:52.655 --> 00:37:56.758]  And the White House admits that Putin now owns the Syria strategy.
[00:37:56.758 --> 00:37:59.620]  Well, I think he actually owned the Globalist.
[00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.023]  That's some of the news up on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:38:03.023 --> 00:38:07.086]  Also up on DrudgeReport in the middle column is an InfoWars.com story.
[00:38:10.717 --> 00:38:16.440]  Where General Petraeus got basically mobbed by people who didn't love him.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:26.065]  Everywhere he goes, and other globalists go now, they get mobbed by people that are angry at them about starting all these wars.
[00:38:26.065 --> 00:38:34.410]  And being part of all the NSA spying and all the CIA domestic operations.
[00:38:37.657 --> 00:38:43.980]  People have had enough, and it is only going to intensify.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.402]  And the establishment foresaw this.
[00:38:47.402 --> 00:38:52.545]  They built a maginal line, like France did against the Germans, that
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:39:08.537]  They thought we'd be able to dumb down humanity, shut up paramilitary forces against humanity, impoverish humanity as a tool of social control and a permanent peasant class, but that has backfired at an ultra-massive level.
[00:39:11.946 --> 00:39:20.691]  Because people are getting wise to the fact that the establishment says they want to make us prosperous, but in truth they want to make us poor.
[00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:24.333]  They say they want to make us healthy, but in truth they want to make us sick.
[00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:27.714]  They say they want to enlighten us, but in truth they dumb us down.
[00:39:27.714 --> 00:39:40.201]  They say they want to end racism and classism and all this compartmentalization, when in truth all they do is try to segregate and divide on petty surface issues so we never come together.
[00:39:43.362 --> 00:39:49.824]  And so, the establishment media is dead.
[00:39:49.824 --> 00:40:02.048]  And the big megacorporations that have robbed the world through monopolies, through combines, through crony systems, they can continue to pay their tithe of propaganda.
[00:40:02.048 --> 00:40:04.708]  That's the phase we've been in for really five years.
[00:40:04.708 --> 00:40:09.990]  They can continue to pay their tithe, their indulgence to NBC, CBS,
[00:40:12.085 --> 00:40:15.308]  ABC, MSNBC, all of it.
[00:40:15.308 --> 00:40:17.530]  But the audience has dwindled down to nothing.
[00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:24.716]  Fox's audience is beginning to dwindle, even though it dwarfs all of them combined, because they played the part of the anti-establishment.
[00:40:24.716 --> 00:40:27.498]  They played the part of the other choice.
[00:40:27.498 --> 00:40:30.001]  And the only reason they're hanging onto some of their viewers
[00:40:31.556 --> 00:40:37.621]  Is because they at least are having more libertarian ideas on, and more anti-establishment ideas on.
[00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:45.706]  But the minute a Republican gets in, that sells people out, if it's not Rand Paul or somebody like that, Fox News will vaporize.
[00:40:45.706 --> 00:40:55.053]  Fox News will be dead, and they know this, if they don't adopt reality.
[00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:56.635]  And I want to say this about the mainstream media.
[00:40:56.635 --> 00:40:59.657]  They are the last group to figure out they're dead.
[00:41:00.782 --> 00:41:08.385]  They consciously know they're in trouble, but they still are filled with hubris and the imagined tokens of success.
[00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:27.811]  The fancy studios, the bling of security, sycophantically treating other people like they're small, to ingratiate the egos of the cloistered cositors of the vomit that spews
[00:41:29.272 --> 00:41:33.076]  Out of both ends of the dinosaur media.
[00:41:33.076 --> 00:41:36.759]  And the dinosaur media is now a rotting carcass.
[00:41:36.759 --> 00:41:49.231]  The only life in it is the insects and the mammals, the shrews, climbing over it, picking off the leavings.
[00:41:52.882 --> 00:41:54.825]  And we are the new media.
[00:41:54.825 --> 00:41:56.006]  We are the media.
[00:41:56.006 --> 00:41:57.689]  We are the new life form.
[00:41:57.689 --> 00:42:00.152]  We are the born-again press.
[00:42:00.152 --> 00:42:01.433]  The born-again muckraker.
[00:42:02.452 --> 00:42:07.535]  Where it's the story and reality and what's happening in the world that is what matters.
[00:42:07.535 --> 00:42:23.346]  That's what the Renaissance was, was about knowing how things worked and being informed and speaking five languages and discovering science and discovering the mysteries because the universe is so beautiful and incredible and amazing that you want to discover the mysteries.
[00:42:23.346 --> 00:42:28.229]  You're not going to find the mysteries at a baseball game.
[00:42:29.087 --> 00:42:30.968]  You're not going to find the mysteries in a basketball game.
[00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:37.333]  You're not going to find the mysteries there following P. Diddy.
[00:42:37.333 --> 00:42:40.816]  Or chasing after Kim Kardashian.
[00:42:40.816 --> 00:42:46.480]  They don't want you to ever find the mysteries because they're so incredible you'll never want to look at them again.
[00:42:47.878 --> 00:42:49.640]  You'll never care about the fancy outfits.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.603]  You won't be impressed by the helicopters and the red carpets.
[00:42:52.603 --> 00:42:57.709]  It's all about them being the center of the universe instead of the universe being all around us.
[00:42:57.709 --> 00:42:59.711]  And then they don't even matter anymore.
[00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:01.333]  Them killing you doesn't matter.
[00:43:01.333 --> 00:43:02.294]  Them coming after you.
[00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:03.316]  Them laughing at you.
[00:43:03.316 --> 00:43:04.757]  You're free now.
[00:43:04.757 --> 00:43:06.279]  You don't have any more fear.
[00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:07.360]  It's all right there.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.602]  And they're all a joke.
[00:43:09.841 --> 00:43:11.141]  The Renaissance is coming.
[00:43:11.141 --> 00:43:12.602]  The Enlightenment is coming.
[00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:14.582]  The empowerment of humanity is coming.
[00:43:14.582 --> 00:43:17.043]  And we're going to have to go through some hell to get there.
[00:43:17.043 --> 00:43:20.884]  The great test, ladies and gentlemen, to prove our mettle to God.
[00:43:20.884 --> 00:43:26.086]  But I'm telling you, this is the greatest time to ever be alive.
[00:43:26.086 --> 00:43:34.228]  And my only fear is that I get imprisoned, set up, killed before I can develop and truly be the leader I should be.
[00:43:35.578 --> 00:43:37.120]  And that's all you should hope for.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.461]  I don't fear death.
[00:43:38.461 --> 00:43:40.063]  I don't fear imprisonment.
[00:43:40.063 --> 00:43:42.145]  I don't fear my name being destroyed.
[00:43:42.145 --> 00:43:44.067]  I don't fear any of it.
[00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:49.653]  I only fear the fact that I have weak flesh, like everybody else.
[00:43:49.653 --> 00:43:54.939]  But I also have strong, strong heart, ladies and gentlemen, and a strong spirit, as you do.
[00:43:54.939 --> 00:43:56.760]  And it's a discovery that you
[00:43:59.113 --> 00:44:02.196]  are a powerful individual when you choose justice.
[00:44:02.196 --> 00:44:09.363]  What Putin was saying in his letter is, it's dangerous just to say you're exceptional when you've not done anything exceptional in a long time.
[00:44:09.363 --> 00:44:18.352]  You've been exceptional, America, and now, instead of being exceptional, you lie and say that you are exceptional.
[00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:21.696]  And the media's like, how dare him say we're not exceptional.
[00:44:21.696 --> 00:44:23.277]  If you read what he said, it's not what he said.
[00:44:23.277 --> 00:44:25.639]  He said, it's very dangerous to think you're invincible.
[00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:28.242]  It's very dangerous to think you can push everybody around forever.
[00:44:28.242 --> 00:44:30.544]  It's very dangerous to live on debt.
[00:44:30.544 --> 00:44:31.425]  We've done it.
[00:44:31.425 --> 00:44:33.767]  We've collapsed before.
[00:44:33.767 --> 00:44:36.389]  It's very dangerous for Napoleon to attack Russia.
[00:44:36.389 --> 00:44:38.932]  It's very dangerous for Hitler to attack Russia.
[00:44:38.932 --> 00:44:40.914]  It's very dangerous for you to attack Russia.
[00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:43.331]  Don't push forever.
[00:44:43.331 --> 00:44:45.173]  Don't think you're invincible.
[00:44:45.173 --> 00:44:46.634]  That's exactly what I've been saying.
[00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:49.177]  Look at the leadership of the New World Order.
[00:44:49.177 --> 00:44:51.239]  Look at those Senators and Congress people.
[00:44:51.239 --> 00:44:55.503]  I mean, those guys all look completely mentally ill.
[00:44:55.503 --> 00:45:01.530]  You look at Vladimir Putin, and I'm not about to tell you he's a good guy, but he's tied into destiny.
[00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.432]  He's tied into the larger universe.
[00:45:03.432 --> 00:45:04.192]  You can see that.
[00:45:05.029 --> 00:45:08.251]  That's why Bush said he looked into his eyes and saw his soul.
[00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:10.252]  Vladimir Putin is direct.
[00:45:10.252 --> 00:45:11.914]  Vladimir Putin is aware.
[00:45:11.914 --> 00:45:15.856]  Vladimir Putin is writing his own letters to the American people.
[00:45:15.856 --> 00:45:17.357]  You can tell he wrote that himself.
[00:45:17.357 --> 00:45:26.103]  Vladimir Putin is a real leader, even if he represents a very corrupt system that, on record, he's been trying to fix and end the corruption.
[00:45:27.276 --> 00:45:29.657]  And paying people to get married and have kids.
[00:45:29.657 --> 00:45:32.218]  Saying, we're under eugenics, we're dying.
[00:45:32.218 --> 00:45:39.681]  And the Russian government saying, don't take the Gardasil shot, it's dangerous.
[00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:48.525]  Russia is a group of people trying to be good, because they've just gone through 80 plus years of pure evil.
[00:45:48.525 --> 00:45:52.287]  They've just lost 30-40% of their population under eugenics.
[00:45:52.287 --> 00:45:53.947]  They've had their families broken up.
[00:45:53.947 --> 00:45:55.448]  They've had the state take their kids.
[00:45:56.766 --> 00:45:59.847]  They've had the men in black uniforms come to their houses and shake them down.
[00:45:59.847 --> 00:46:03.889]  And they still have that stuff going on, but they're trying to phase it out.
[00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:10.512]  And Putin is saying, you, I've been taken over by evil and you are in danger.
[00:46:10.512 --> 00:46:21.236]  And the response here by Menendez, who led that committee, who came off literally like a sycophantic
[00:46:22.594 --> 00:46:27.738]  Courtier in some demonic fiefdom.
[00:46:27.738 --> 00:46:33.022]  I mean, he came off like some evil toady in a court.
[00:46:33.022 --> 00:46:33.883]  A royal court.
[00:46:33.883 --> 00:46:36.465]  Putin op-ed made me want to vomit.
[00:46:36.465 --> 00:46:48.114]  The Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, with all his scandals, completely blackmailed, sent a New York Times op-ed on Syria, penned by Russian President Vladimir Putin, made him want to vomit.
[00:46:48.114 --> 00:46:51.417]  Echoing a sentiment being widely expressed Thursday,
[00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:53.891]  By Capitol Hill.
[00:46:53.891 --> 00:47:01.117]  Yeah, you know, sometimes when you're really sick and they need to get some poison out of you, they have you take salts to make you throw up.
[00:47:01.117 --> 00:47:04.841]  And I agree, you guys ought to be throwing up.
[00:47:04.841 --> 00:47:08.183]  You ought to throw up all those demons that are inside of you.
[00:47:08.183 --> 00:47:14.369]  Because, let me tell you something, I don't romanticize Vladimir Putin, but I've looked into him, I've watched him, I've listened to him.
[00:47:14.369 --> 00:47:17.672]  That guy's looking you straight in the eye, and you can tell what's going on there.
[00:47:18.575 --> 00:47:20.336]  That guy's actually in charge.
[00:47:20.336 --> 00:47:27.261]  I look at you guys and you're all just a bunch of toadies paid off by a bunch of corrupt banks that can't even coordinate what they're doing.
[00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:30.443]  You guys are involved in every evil there is and I can tell something too.
[00:47:30.443 --> 00:47:32.405]  You guys are freaked out at night.
[00:47:32.405 --> 00:47:34.226]  I bet you guys have nightmares.
[00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:36.627]  I'll guarantee you Menendez has nightmares at night.
[00:47:36.627 --> 00:47:38.829]  I guarantee you John Kerry has nightmares at night.
[00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:44.433]  John Kerry would have to lay down his hands during the speech and was shaking.
[00:47:45.595 --> 00:47:49.477]  When Harry Reid comes out and gives these evil pro-war speeches, he looks completely freaked out.
[00:47:49.477 --> 00:47:52.658]  Can you imagine how dirty it feels, even if you're evil?
[00:47:52.658 --> 00:47:56.700]  See, these guys didn't sell out just for pure murder and death, most of them.
[00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:58.501]  Like their masters did.
[00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:04.684]  They sold out for petty trinkets of power, and they've already had all the petty trinkets of power, and they didn't fulfill them.
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:18.947]  They have the symptom of wickedness written in their eyes, but the symptom of slaves.
[00:48:18.947 --> 00:48:21.711]  These men are zombies to Satan.
[00:48:21.711 --> 00:48:27.980]  They are not actual operatives.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.342]  And that's why they're so pathetic.
[00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:48.902]  America is like a giant vending machine for special interests to get whatever they want out of it, and they've whored us up one side and down the other, and bloated us, and pumped us up in these big bubbles to just keep their empire going, and now it's all coming to the end of the line.
[00:48:48.902 --> 00:48:51.443]  And no amount of false flags are going to save them.
[00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:54.305]  No amount of tyranny is going to fix things.
[00:48:54.305 --> 00:49:00.168]  It'll give them a sugar high for a little while, but it dissipates faster and faster, and they've noticed that historically.
[00:49:00.168 --> 00:49:02.089]  So, that's what I wanted to get to here today.
[00:49:03.353 --> 00:49:06.894]  Then I'm going to get into all the news and the guests and open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:49:06.894 --> 00:49:08.515]  Lew Rockwell's going to pop in for about 30 minutes.
[00:49:08.515 --> 00:49:09.675]  We'll take calls first.
[00:49:09.675 --> 00:49:13.516]  The toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:18.618]  And that's why I've been talking about the tipping point that we're now entering.
[00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:21.479]  But things could spin out of control in that tipping point.
[00:49:21.479 --> 00:49:26.420]  They could decide to try to go to hot martial law, take over the media, launch fake cyber attacks.
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.161]  They could do anything.
[00:49:30.161 --> 00:49:32.262]  And that's why it is absolutely
[00:49:33.578 --> 00:49:41.544]  It's essential that all of us be as active as we can now before we get to this point that Alexander Schultz and Nietzsche wrote in the Gulag Archipelago.
[00:49:41.544 --> 00:50:00.659]  Oh how we burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family.
[00:50:01.641 --> 00:50:22.084]  Or if during periods of mass arrest, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, hauling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door, at every step on the staircase, but had understood that they had nothing left to lose, and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush,
[00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:38.670]  Of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, whatever else was at hand, the organs of the state would have very quickly suffered a shortage of officers and transport, and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the curse machine would have ground to a halt.
[00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:50.098]  If, if, we didn't love freedom enough, and even more, we had no awareness of the real situation, we purely and simply deserved everything that happened to us afterwards.
[00:50:51.857 --> 00:50:53.879]  That's what all the TSA training is.
[00:50:53.879 --> 00:50:54.779]  It's arrest training.
[00:50:54.779 --> 00:50:59.503]  So when they finally come to take you to kill you, you don't resist.
[00:50:59.503 --> 00:51:01.124]  It's catch and release training.
[00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.686]  You are now in the crosshairs.
[00:51:02.686 --> 00:51:07.209]  The NSA and FBI are treating you like a criminal and monitoring your every move.
[00:51:07.209 --> 00:51:14.115]  Ron Paul said recently, the evidence of the totalitarian nature of this government is on display undeniably every day.
[00:51:14.115 --> 00:51:17.618]  What's taking place right now is a coup and the destruction of the Constitution.

[00:54:25.119 --> 00:54:30.503]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:54:30.503 --> 00:54:31.904]  Beautiful poetry right here.
[00:54:31.904 --> 00:54:32.865]  A symptom of the universe.
[00:54:32.865 --> 00:54:33.285]  Crank it up!
[00:54:56.019 --> 00:54:59.342]  The Symptom of the Universe!
[00:54:59.342 --> 00:55:03.785]  We are back live broadcasting world-wide!
[00:55:03.785 --> 00:55:06.827]  Call for a number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:55:06.827 --> 00:55:08.589]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:22.459]  By the way, we fund our operation here that is changing the world in many levels, thanks to all your prayers and support, by the books, the videos, the t-shirts we sell that are then meant to wake other people up and to meet like-minded people.
[00:55:22.459 --> 00:55:24.301]  And I designed this baby, I'm very proud of it.
[00:55:25.586 --> 00:55:39.154]  It is the Obamacare shirt and it is the pinwheel of death that you see for Macintosh users that we see so often around here.
[00:55:39.154 --> 00:55:42.856]  It is the pinwheel of death and it says Obamacare.
[00:55:42.856 --> 00:55:47.038]  Infowars.com on the back it says death panels are cool.
[00:55:49.361 --> 00:55:51.643]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:51.643 --> 00:55:52.864]  I don't know if it's going to be popular.
[00:55:52.864 --> 00:55:56.867]  I think it's a great way, because people are really mad right now.
[00:55:56.867 --> 00:56:03.373]  Everybody who supported it is going from 40 to 20 hours on average, or they're finding out that it's not paid for by some rich guy.
[00:56:03.373 --> 00:56:11.420]  No, no, rich guys wrote that, who don't pay taxes, who have diplomatic immunity, who own giant fleets of aircraft, because they're criminals that ripped you off, Dumbo.
[00:56:13.254 --> 00:56:32.790]  And I'm not trying to be mean to you, Dumbo, but you're the same people that want to take my guns, my property, and give it to that schmuck Warren Buffett, who's the biggest recipient of bailout money and is basically offshore tax exempt while he lectures people all day to take people making $30,000 a year money!
[00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:33.971]  Excuse me, I'm trying not to get mad.
[00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:37.814]  It just enrages me.
[00:56:37.814 --> 00:56:38.795]  And you know what I love?
[00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:40.396]  I love the snot-nosed trendies.
[00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.638]  They're not laughing now, are you jackasses?
[00:56:43.888 --> 00:56:46.810]  And listen, I want you to finally wake up that you've been conned.
[00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.011]  You're like, well, do I vote for a Republican?
[00:56:49.011 --> 00:56:50.392]  Yeah, if it's Rand Paul, maybe.
[00:56:50.392 --> 00:56:51.292]  You try something.
[00:56:51.292 --> 00:57:00.197]  You understand Obama is worse because he gets everybody who's liberal to think everything he does is liberal because he's a Democrat.
[00:57:00.197 --> 00:57:01.898]  Or he's black.
[00:57:01.898 --> 00:57:04.199]  But it has nothing to do with it.
[00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:05.560]  There are black psychopaths.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.161]  There are white psychopaths.
[00:57:07.161 --> 00:57:10.102]  I mean, that's ridiculous to just think it's about somebody's skin color.
[00:57:10.102 --> 00:57:12.704]  That is the opposite of what Martin Luther King told everybody.
[00:57:13.581 --> 00:57:19.505]  But they do then brand to skin color certain stereotypes.
[00:57:19.505 --> 00:57:21.867]  And then that actually gets picked up by people.
[00:57:21.867 --> 00:57:25.810]  And then they go, oh, don't be stereotypical while they push stereotypical.
[00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:37.959]  You see, because they don't want you to get stereotypically liberty oriented, stereotypically aggressive, stereotypically armed, stereotypically informed, stereotypically involved, dynamic, alive.
[00:57:39.616 --> 00:57:41.176]  You need to become alive!
[00:57:41.176 --> 00:57:42.316]  You need to wake up!
[00:57:42.316 --> 00:57:43.257]  You need to live!
[00:57:43.257 --> 00:57:46.537]  Beauty will defeat the New World Order.
[00:57:46.537 --> 00:57:48.438]  Art will defeat the New World Order.
[00:57:48.438 --> 00:57:52.698]  Simply resisting in little ways every day.
[00:57:52.698 --> 00:57:56.659]  You get a back issue, we printed 30,000 extra of the, what, July issue?
[00:57:56.659 --> 00:57:58.219]  With the 10 free bumper stickers in it?
[00:57:58.219 --> 00:57:59.860]  You stick those up in areas?
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:03.980]  Not on people's private property, but on globalist outposts and things?
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.881]  You will reach thousands of people just doing that.
[00:58:05.881 --> 00:58:07.001]  I mean, there's an example.
[00:58:08.519 --> 00:58:11.363]  And that's exactly what you've been doing, and that's why we're having an effect.
[00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:18.814]  So we have the new Obamacare t-shirt at InfoWarsStorm.com, and I'm gonna wear this baby out.
[00:58:18.814 --> 00:58:23.601]  One of my other favorites is the Don't Tread on Me and the Liberty or Death Red Snake and all that, but this one, I like it.
[00:58:24.727 --> 00:58:26.207]  Everybody, I saw it and it's more like, wow!
[00:58:26.207 --> 00:58:27.208]  They just came in yesterday.

[00:58:30.128 --> 00:58:30.508]  Hut!
[00:58:30.508 --> 00:58:31.288]  Hut!
[00:58:31.288 --> 00:58:31.549]  Hut!
[00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:32.009]  Hut!
[00:58:32.009 --> 00:58:33.269]  Second hour!
[00:58:33.269 --> 00:58:37.270]  Straight ahead!
[00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:38.290]  Yeah!
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:43.231]  Yeah!
[00:58:43.231 --> 00:58:47.212]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.939 --> 00:58:56.443]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[00:58:56.443 --> 00:59:00.266]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[00:59:00.266 --> 00:59:03.689]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[00:59:03.689 --> 00:59:07.131]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:13.756]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[00:59:13.756 --> 00:59:17.179]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:29.230]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:34.735]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.
[00:59:34.735 --> 00:59:40.181]  To find out more information on how supernatural silver can help you win the war against deadly pathogens,
[00:59:40.461 --> 00:59:42.843]  Go to SupernaturalSilver.com.
[00:59:42.843 --> 00:59:45.565]  That's SupernaturalSilver.com.

[00:59:53.491 --> 00:59:55.893]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.893 --> 00:59:58.675]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:10.128]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.729]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.729 --> 01:00:13.270]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:17.452]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:23.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.235 --> 01:00:26.417]  It's time to come alive, my friends!
[01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:27.398]  Time to wake up!
[01:00:30.117 --> 01:00:35.639]  We're going to be taking your phone calls and covering the incredible breaking news until Lou Rockwell joins us in about 20 minutes.
[01:00:35.639 --> 01:00:37.140]  We'll continue with calls.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:50.046]  Then the wife of the man executed by police, Totechev, in the new death squads the FBI has formed under NDAA, and they say it's legal, actually just to go around executing people who have declared national security on it.
[01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.526]  They said we're just going to start killing whoever we want.
[01:00:51.526 --> 01:00:52.967]  I'm going to talk to his wife.
[01:00:52.967 --> 01:00:56.229]  We're also lining up the mother and father and folks soon.
[01:00:57.509 --> 01:00:59.470]  Stay with us for that.
[01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:06.972]  I kind of went into a rampage last hour of preaching about the fact that it's a facade that the establishment's in control.
[01:01:06.972 --> 01:01:11.193]  And that illusion has worked up until now, but we have reached the tipping point.
[01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:15.354]  But the next few years, folks, is going to be full steam ahead into that tipping point.
[01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:26.882]  And as Drudge said of DrudgeReport.com, Matt Drudge, that 2013 was the year of Alex Jones, or is the year of Alex Jones, you're not going to have the mainstream media come out and say that.
[01:01:26.882 --> 01:01:32.824]  And I don't even think it's the year of Alex Jones.
[01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:41.988]  It's the year of the mass awakening, and so who can be seen as the most radical who accurately predicted a lot of what was happening?
[01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:44.129]  I have, but I'm just some symbol to pick out.
[01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:44.649]  I'm nothing.
[01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:50.511]  Yeah, you can put it back up.
[01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:52.232]  I'll take the bug down so people can actually read it.
[01:01:52.232 --> 01:01:53.732]  That's what I was directing.
[01:01:53.732 --> 01:01:56.233]  I'm the only radio guy directing the TV show at the same time.
[01:01:56.233 --> 01:01:58.474]  You're a radio listener and you're like, what's this guy talking about?
[01:01:58.474 --> 01:02:02.095]  He said, privately told friends would be year of Alex Jones.
[01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:07.557]  Never met or talked with the man, but one hell of a broadcast in such a homogenized media.
[01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:12.078]  And that's basically what we're talking about here.
[01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:19.984]  And now I do realize, going out in public, it's not every fifth or tenth person that stops and is a listener.
[01:02:19.984 --> 01:02:21.147]  It's like every other person.
[01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:25.284]  And they're not just passively, oh, I know who you are, you're that conspiracy guy.
[01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.686]  It's, I love what you're doing, man.
[01:02:26.686 --> 01:02:27.987]  Oh, my whole family's waking up.
[01:02:27.987 --> 01:02:36.373]  And again, the good news is, I'm telling you, people are awake the last few years because the numbers intensify of people that tell me they're awake.
[01:02:36.373 --> 01:02:38.154]  And it's not just where I live in Austin, Texas.
[01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.515]  I can go to England.
[01:02:39.515 --> 01:02:40.716]  I can go to Honduras.
[01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:43.378]  I can go to, you know, Serbia.
[01:02:43.378 --> 01:02:45.060]  I've had family in Serbia and they're like,
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:52.322]  My God, there's InfoWars stickers and people wearing InfoWars shirts and they'll come up to you like taxi drivers.
[01:02:52.322 --> 01:02:54.523]  I had family in France and in Italy.
[01:02:54.523 --> 01:02:56.624]  My parents go to Europe a lot.
[01:02:56.624 --> 01:03:01.565]  And they've had taxi cab drivers repeatedly go, Alex Jones is a great American.
[01:03:01.565 --> 01:03:02.686]  I like Americans.
[01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:06.027]  I think Alex Jones is what America stands for.
[01:03:06.027 --> 01:03:06.807]  And I'm not saying that.
[01:03:06.807 --> 01:03:07.768]  That's what they say in Europe.
[01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:08.368]  It's bizarre.
[01:03:09.108 --> 01:03:10.730]  And they go, well, we're his parents.
[01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:15.874]  And the people for like days will drive them for free and take care of them and everything.
[01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:22.480]  And that's in Italy and in France that's happened to my parents.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.144]  Cab drivers will start telling them about Alex Jones and they'll say, well, we're his parents.
[01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:30.266]  And then the person basically valets them for days.
[01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:31.748]  I mean, it's bizarre, folks.
[01:03:31.748 --> 01:03:35.031]  And I don't ever tell those stories, you know, to get up there and brag.
[01:03:35.031 --> 01:03:36.172]  It's no brag, just fact.
[01:03:37.159 --> 01:03:38.940]  Who was the famous Western actor that said that?
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.821]  No brag, just fact.
[01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:40.741]  But it's not about me.
[01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:42.823]  It's actually very humbling.
[01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:43.964]  I mean, I don't even put makeup on.
[01:03:43.964 --> 01:03:44.644]  I have to be on TV.
[01:03:44.644 --> 01:03:45.985]  I got all this sun damage.
[01:03:45.985 --> 01:03:47.146]  Hair's falling out.
[01:03:47.146 --> 01:03:49.187]  Wearing a white t-shirt on the radio, TV.
[01:03:49.187 --> 01:03:50.849]  I don't even care about all that.
[01:03:50.849 --> 01:03:55.332]  I'm telling you, though, this show is growing exponentially.
[01:03:55.332 --> 01:04:00.055]  And I don't know what to do, but just keep doing what I've been doing.
[01:04:00.055 --> 01:04:02.517]  And I'm trying to redesign the websites to be more serious.
[01:04:03.217 --> 01:04:06.078]  And focused exactly as people told us the site should be.
[01:04:06.078 --> 01:04:08.039]  That's even what I said two years ago.
[01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:11.380]  The exact same thing.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.380]  I'm trying to get the TV launched.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.841]  I'm trying to get it all done.
[01:04:14.841 --> 01:04:18.322]  And I know that the advice is good I've been given and I need to focus.
[01:04:19.602 --> 01:04:22.425]  On this show, and what I cover on the radio.
[01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:24.607]  Because that's what's really reaching everything.
[01:04:24.607 --> 01:04:29.291]  I'm so busy, literally, deciding what kind of light bulbs to put in.
[01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:36.098]  But I'm just brainstorming on air, folks, because I don't know what to do with the phenomenon that this broadcast has become.
[01:04:36.098 --> 01:04:42.604]  And of course, the establishment media, the state-run dead media, is not going to herald that.
[01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:54.485]  They're just going to put subliminals in saying I'm a racist or I've been mean to women on Bill O'Reilly with no evidence or I'm behind terrorist bombings on MSNBC because they're scared.
[01:04:54.485 --> 01:04:56.186]  And they should be.
[01:04:56.186 --> 01:04:59.008]  And because we only represent you, folks.
[01:05:00.532 --> 01:05:05.258]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:05:05.258 --> 01:05:08.362]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:13.929]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:05:13.929 --> 01:05:15.551]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:05:15.851 --> 01:05:17.492]  We are what we eat.
[01:05:17.492 --> 01:05:22.156]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:05:22.156 --> 01:05:26.380]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.942]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:05:28.942 --> 01:05:35.167]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.640]  He wrote all that.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.723]  What a poet.
[01:09:15.723 --> 01:09:19.025]  Unbelievable.
[01:09:19.025 --> 01:09:20.327]  And that is exactly
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:33.209]  What we are facing right now, ladies and gentlemen, and now the big news, obviously, is they are going to give their chemical weapons.
[01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:34.009]  They never signed a treaty.
[01:09:34.009 --> 01:09:34.910]  They're legal and lawful.
[01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.771]  Israel has legal and lawful chemical weapons.
[01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:38.112]  They never signed a treaty either.
[01:09:38.112 --> 01:09:39.373]  That's in the news right now.
[01:09:39.373 --> 01:09:42.355]  Why does Israel have chemical weapons and didn't sign the treaty?
[01:09:42.355 --> 01:09:44.477]  And there's no reason you could say you can't have those.
[01:09:44.477 --> 01:09:46.839]  It's like, well, they're allowed to, but Syria can't.
[01:09:48.263 --> 01:09:55.687]  And even if you don't like Assad, most people that don't like him don't even know the history of it, and know that he's been trying to reform the country.
[01:09:55.687 --> 01:09:57.949]  The West is like, lower your guard and let us come in.
[01:09:57.949 --> 01:09:59.069]  Okay, I lowered my guard.
[01:09:59.069 --> 01:09:59.950]  Ha, you sucker!
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.681]  And we did that to Gaddafi!
[01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.643]  Shut him down and put Al-Qaeda in charge!
[01:10:04.643 --> 01:10:06.385]  We took out our own guy in Egypt!
[01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:08.406]  We're putting Al-Qaeda in charge!
[01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:10.208]  Now shut up!
[01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:16.033]  Then we can have Al-Qaeda attack the West and take all our people's liberty, while we destroy your cities!
[01:10:16.033 --> 01:10:19.856]  All Al-Qaeda wants is money, and to be able to rape women and chop heads off!
[01:10:19.856 --> 01:10:21.077]  They're just like us!
[01:10:21.077 --> 01:10:22.979]  They're after our own heart!
[01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:26.102]  They're sorcerers of death's construction, and they are our children!
[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.731]  That's the reality.
[01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:37.756]  The New World Order is in the New World Order business of killing sovereign countries and waging war against the innocent.
[01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:54.746]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 12th day of September 2013, and we are crossing into the tipping point, the event horizon.
[01:10:58.206 --> 01:10:59.347]  Can you feel it?
[01:10:59.347 --> 01:11:01.350]  I know you can.
[01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:04.834]  And they know you have that subconscious feeling of major change happening.
[01:11:04.834 --> 01:11:06.917]  So they want to tell you, that anxiety you're having?
[01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:08.359]  It's over Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:08.359 --> 01:11:10.341]  And we're like, but you run Al-Qaeda!
[01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:15.888]  You're right, that's not the threat now, it's the veterans and the gun owners and people who like George Washington and want to make the world a better place.
[01:11:15.888 --> 01:11:16.649]  That's an exact quote.
[01:11:17.619 --> 01:11:19.060]  Department of Defense training manual.
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:28.508]  Imagine being officers in the Army or the Marines and being taught George Washington wouldn't be welcome in today's Marine Corps, boy!
[01:11:28.508 --> 01:11:32.111]  George Washington wouldn't be welcome in today's Army!
[01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:34.092]  That is the founder of the U.S.
[01:11:34.092 --> 01:11:34.293]  Army!
[01:11:35.325 --> 01:11:37.485]  The first member of the U.S.
[01:11:37.485 --> 01:11:38.446]  Army.
[01:11:38.446 --> 01:11:42.847]  The man that started the country with the U.S.
[01:11:42.847 --> 01:11:43.167]  Army!
[01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:49.608]  And they dared... That is absolute blasphemy if you love this republic.
[01:11:49.608 --> 01:11:55.649]  These people are infidel defilers of our republic and are the enemy!
[01:11:55.649 --> 01:11:58.210]  Enemies!
[01:11:58.210 --> 01:11:59.150]  Ancient enemies!
[01:12:02.144 --> 01:12:03.845]  I don't try not to act like this, folks.
[01:12:03.845 --> 01:12:11.090]  I just think about these murderers and everything they've done and how they must be dealt with.
[01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:14.793]  And the spirit of liberty, ladies and gentlemen, is rising!
[01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:19.516]  Can you not feel it?
[01:12:19.516 --> 01:12:20.437]  And at the same time,
[01:12:24.172 --> 01:12:24.993]  Why are you getting so upset?
[01:12:24.993 --> 01:12:26.433]  This guy's crazy.
[01:12:26.433 --> 01:12:38.361]  Yeah, I just know all over Austin, Texas, babies are being born today where I live and are being injected on purpose with deadly vaccines that are giving them basically 20 point or more IQ reductions on the spot.
[01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:40.763]  I mean, that's attempted murder.
[01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:43.354]  And I shouldn't get upset.
[01:12:43.354 --> 01:12:47.055]  See, I can't use physical violence because they set it up in this stage of the game.
[01:12:47.055 --> 01:12:48.696]  They can beat us if we do that right now.
[01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:52.058]  So I'm savaging them with the First Amendment.
[01:12:52.058 --> 01:12:52.938]  And that is a weapon.
[01:12:52.938 --> 01:12:53.959]  That's why it comes first.
[01:12:53.959 --> 01:13:04.224]  I am using it as it was meant to be used with the sword of truth, viciously attacking the enemy and trying to get people out of their drug-induced, mind-poisoned comas.
[01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:10.011]  To realize that we're under attack and have the enemy overrunning us.
[01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:15.535]  And if we ever woke up, we outnumber them a thousand to one and it's over!
[01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:26.846]  So I'm literally standing in your bedroom while you're in a coma, and the house is on fire, and the rafters are coming down, and my shirt's on fire, and I'm going, I gotta get out of here!
[01:13:26.846 --> 01:13:28.848]  We either gotta put this house out or get out of here!
[01:13:28.848 --> 01:13:30.229]  This is a red-level emergency!
[01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:41.199]  And you're kind of opening your eye, get your nightcap on, and you're, uh, well, let's see, it's a crazy man, and you're, uh, you're even coughing because of the smoke and the new world order, and you're, and I'm like, that's smoke, it's fire!
[01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:42.680]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.122]  Nothing ever bad would happen.
[01:13:51.363 --> 01:14:02.781]  I am the madness of liberty responding to the madness of tyranny.
[01:14:02.781 --> 01:14:04.043]  Because true freedom is madness.
[01:14:06.391 --> 01:14:11.993]  You know madness is associated with high IQ, with art, with moments of clarity.
[01:14:11.993 --> 01:14:15.314]  The globalists, they follow their dark flame of death and destruction.
[01:14:15.314 --> 01:14:18.275]  That is their madness.
[01:14:18.275 --> 01:14:25.357]  We have our madness, the animating contest of liberty that is so much greater and better if we'll only discover it.
[01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:29.198]  I said I'd go to your calls, we're going to them right now, then Lou Rockwell's coming up, then back to your phone calls.
[01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:40.712]  Putin has written a heartfelt letter to the American people to not start World War III, and to take the chemical weapons out that were clearly a pretext and launch al-Qaeda, and our media is saying, how dare you scum!
[01:14:40.712 --> 01:14:45.258]  We will have war, we will have murder, we will have death, we are trendy, we are liberal.
[01:14:45.258 --> 01:14:47.481]  Peace prize, peace prize, peace prize, war is peace.
[01:14:49.013 --> 01:14:50.574]  uh... and meanwhile a u.s.
[01:14:50.574 --> 01:15:18.333]  weapons are reaching syrian rebels that's in the washington post paul watson has all written up in detail info wars dot com black jihadist flies flag over christian town that they've destroyed and uh... put the catholics to death so there you go and uh... the pope is refusing assad's calls and and desperate please say for the christian minorities protected well uh... not criticizing the pope really i think that's up to catholics to do that but i'm really
[01:15:19.278 --> 01:15:24.200]  I think people ought to be, you're Catholic especially, they're murdering Catholics by the thousands every day over there.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.601]  CIA begins delivering weapons to Al-Qaeda in Syria.
[01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:31.702]  Kurt Nemo wrote about that in detail beyond the Washington Post.
[01:15:31.702 --> 01:15:35.863]  David Petraeus ambushed branded war criminal by protesters.
[01:15:35.863 --> 01:15:37.864]  That's up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:45.498]  Putin's letter to America, he actually just put it out in the New York Times published it, but everybody's, oh, New York Times got it, New York Times got it.
[01:15:45.498 --> 01:15:50.819]  Prepare for tough times if your job has anything to do with real estate and mortgages.
[01:15:50.819 --> 01:15:54.180]  Another one, is this why Obama's so desperate for a nice little war?
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:59.222]  And Zero Hedges reporting, GLDETF investors unable to get physical gold.
[01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:00.662]  That's because the market's been manipulated.
[01:16:00.662 --> 01:16:03.483]  Gold's a lot more than what they actually say it is in physical reality.
[01:16:03.483 --> 01:16:05.564]  And that manipulation's now coming to the surface.
[01:16:06.124 --> 01:16:06.925]  Like a cold sore.
[01:16:06.925 --> 01:16:11.768]  9-11 Commission Chair, Director of Intelligence James Clapper should be indicted for perjury.
[01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.910]  Yeah, he publicly perjured himself.
[01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:14.230]  U.S.
[01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:17.192]  can't prove Bashar Assad provided chemical weapons to Syria.
[01:16:17.192 --> 01:16:17.952]  Washington Times.
[01:16:17.952 --> 01:16:19.233]  Yeah, that's to say the least.
[01:16:19.233 --> 01:16:22.576]  Well, we have jihadis loading the chemical weapons on all these videos.
[01:16:22.576 --> 01:16:25.618]  Let's go to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:25.618 --> 01:16:33.724]  And then Obama, oh vomit, the demon frontman, the El Presidente of El Diablo,
[01:16:35.598 --> 01:16:36.979]  He has been caught lying.
[01:16:36.979 --> 01:16:41.620]  Oh, it turns out they have the command orders to persecute the real Tea Party.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.901]  You know, the enemy, people that like George Washington.
[01:16:43.901 --> 01:16:46.142]  Let's talk to Ben in Missouri.
[01:16:46.142 --> 01:16:47.303]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:47.703]  Go ahead.
[01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.323]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:49.323 --> 01:16:50.944]  It's a pleasure to speak with you again.
[01:16:50.944 --> 01:16:53.685]  It's the second time I've been on the air.
[01:16:53.685 --> 01:17:00.268]  I just wanted to, well, first of all, give a quick shout out to the great people that I met on the overpass protest.
[01:17:01.135 --> 01:17:05.479]  I just wanted to share a quick story with you and the listeners.
[01:17:27.273 --> 01:17:32.495]  Um, about, well, he's actually, he doesn't seem like such a bad guy.
[01:17:32.495 --> 01:17:33.315]  He's a friend of mine.
[01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:40.278]  I can't, uh, I don't want to say who he is, but I'm sure telling this story, if anybody who knows him is listening will know who I'm speaking about.
[01:17:41.559 --> 01:17:50.001]  This is a guy who I play hockey with every Thursday night, and he's a really, really rich guy.
[01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:52.402]  Talking like hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:54.462]  Somebody who's bought and sold businesses.
[01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:57.063]  He's nouveau riche.
[01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:58.663]  Tell me about him.
[01:17:58.663 --> 01:18:09.005]  Well, I was talking to him, and I was having one of these moments when I was getting myself worked up about what's going on in the world today, and I said to him,
[01:18:12.165 --> 01:18:16.787]  Let me just ask you straight up, because you know, you've traveled, you've been tied in with everything.
[01:18:16.787 --> 01:18:23.591]  Is there an evil cabal of eugenicists who are trying to control the world?
[01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:26.873]  Who are trying to take over the world, who want to kill us all?
[01:18:26.873 --> 01:18:30.295]  And he looked at me in the eye and he said, yes.
[01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:33.376]  And it was a mind-blowing, mind-blowing moment.
[01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:39.659]  And so I took it one step further, because I was trying to figure out if I could get this guy to say no to anything.
[01:18:39.659 --> 01:18:40.360]  So I said to him,
[01:18:41.161 --> 01:18:42.822]  Wow, that's crazy.
[01:18:42.822 --> 01:18:50.846]  So I said, have they literally sold their soul to the devil in order to get the power that they have?
[01:18:50.846 --> 01:18:54.728]  And he looked me in the eye and he said, yes.
[01:18:54.728 --> 01:18:55.968]  And I said, you know this beyond.
[01:18:55.968 --> 01:18:58.329]  He was like, yes.
[01:18:58.329 --> 01:19:01.931]  And I was like, but you don't even believe in, you know, God, the devil, stuff like that.
[01:19:01.931 --> 01:19:07.294]  So he backtracked a little bit and said, well, you know, because they're willing to do things,
[01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:16.759]  They're of the devil, because they're willing to do things, because they're willing to build their business on the destruction of human life and, you know, basically... Yeah, that's it!
[01:19:16.759 --> 01:19:19.441]  Even if the devil isn't real, they have become the devil!
[01:19:20.444 --> 01:19:23.986]  I've never talked to a high-powered person that didn't know all this stuff.
[01:19:23.986 --> 01:19:28.709]  I mean, you don't even get into an advanced program at MIT or the University of Texas unless you're brought in and they tell you.
[01:19:44.986 --> 01:19:46.028]  It's a cult, folks.
[01:19:46.028 --> 01:19:55.261]  There's a cult of scientific eugenicists that are almost in control of the world, and now their plan's coming into fruition when people are struggling.
[01:19:55.261 --> 01:19:58.145]  And people are waking up to it, and all I can say is thank God.
[01:19:58.145 --> 01:20:00.269]  More calls coming up, and Lou Rockwell, stay with us.
[01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:02.364]  Hi there.
[01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:03.885]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:20:03.885 --> 01:20:07.707]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:20:07.707 --> 01:20:16.873]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:23.578]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:20:23.578 --> 01:20:25.759]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:20:25.759 --> 01:20:30.843]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:20:31.563 --> 01:20:39.504]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:20:39.504 --> 01:20:45.085]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:20:45.085 --> 01:20:51.587]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:20:51.587 --> 01:20:57.308]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:20:57.308 --> 01:20:58.428]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:05.036]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:21:05.036 --> 01:21:08.141]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:21:08.141 --> 01:21:13.709]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:15.312]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:21:15.612 --> 01:21:17.253]  We are what we eat.
[01:21:17.253 --> 01:21:21.936]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:21:21.936 --> 01:21:26.159]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:28.721]  All of this has been engineered by design.

[01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:01.270]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:05.772]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:05.772 --> 01:22:11.474]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:11.474 --> 01:22:15.036]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:15.036 --> 01:22:17.717]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:17.717 --> 01:22:22.679]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:22:33.304 --> 01:22:36.745]  You need a secret bunker, and you need it deep and strong.

[01:22:59.277 --> 01:23:00.138]  My name's Bruno.
[01:23:00.138 --> 01:23:01.519]  I'm 52 years old.
[01:23:01.519 --> 01:23:05.141]  I've tried different protein powders over the years and they've all tasted pretty bad.
[01:23:05.141 --> 01:23:07.402]  I tried One World Way and found it to be delicious.
[01:23:07.402 --> 01:23:13.366]  After 10 weeks on One World Way, my wife commented, you have more muscles and you're leaner than when you were 20 years old.
[01:23:13.366 --> 01:23:14.927]  My body has changed dramatically.
[01:23:15.467 --> 01:23:16.387]  I'm a cyclist.
[01:23:16.387 --> 01:23:19.409]  Normally I'll ride two days on and take two days off.
[01:23:19.409 --> 01:23:29.533]  After being on One World Way, I rode ten days in a row in over 100 degree heat and then I take another two servings of One World Way and then work out at the gym for another hour and a half.
[01:23:29.533 --> 01:23:31.733]  I just couldn't believe these results.
[01:23:31.733 --> 01:23:35.915]  My normal muscle tightness and soreness after working out are virtually gone.
[01:23:35.915 --> 01:23:37.416]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:39.457]  One World Way comes in single servings.
[01:23:39.457 --> 01:23:40.337]  Just give it a try.
[01:23:40.962 --> 01:23:44.085]  For a health and taste sensation you'll love, call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:44.365]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:44.906]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:44.906 --> 01:23:46.687]  Or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:47.929]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:23:47.929 --> 01:23:49.610]  I can see for miles and miles and
[01:24:14.579 --> 01:24:26.396]  If you think that I don't know about the little tricks you play, I'll never see you when delivering
[01:24:28.837 --> 01:24:42.667]  Well, he is Ron Paul's former Chief of Staff, and he's an icon of the Liberty Movement, and he's predicted the crumbling of the American crony-capitalist, anti-free market mafia system.
[01:24:42.667 --> 01:24:48.372]  And now Putin and others have said, we'll take the chemical weapons away, we'll stop war any way we can.
[01:24:48.372 --> 01:24:51.334]  Bashar Assad says, I don't want another crazy war.
[01:24:51.334 --> 01:24:52.755]  Your al-Qaeda is attacking us.
[01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:53.536]  It's all on record.
[01:24:54.196 --> 01:24:59.323]  And now it's all coming out and Democratic Republican Senators like Mendez say they want to vomit.
[01:25:00.859 --> 01:25:10.402]  Over Putin insulting us, saying we've been great friends with America to fight Hitler, we want to work with you now, please let's stop war, give peace a chance.
[01:25:10.402 --> 01:25:14.124]  John Lennon, and their answer is we want to vomit on you.
[01:25:14.124 --> 01:25:22.967]  So I want to get Lou Rockwell, who again really has his finger on the pulse and has predicted so much of this in his writings at lourockwell.com.
[01:25:24.187 --> 01:25:33.329]  To give us his take on where we are, because Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, the New York Sun, Conrad Black, all these people have said what I'm saying.
[01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:36.989]  I see this as the beginning of the fall of the Soviet Union.
[01:25:36.989 --> 01:25:43.850]  1987 if we were East Germany, before 1989, 1990, 1989 for 1991.
[01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:45.111]  I think it's already collapsed.
[01:25:45.111 --> 01:25:46.311]  The numbers show that.
[01:25:46.311 --> 01:25:48.511]  Dominant media is no longer dominant.
[01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:51.972]  Lew Rockwell, what's your take on this point we're at in history, sir?
[01:25:52.867 --> 01:25:55.168]  Well, it certainly has been going on for a while, Alex.
[01:25:55.168 --> 01:26:07.732]  I mean, I think we can actually trace it back to George Bush and companies' invasion of Iraq into the real estate bubble the Federal Reserve deliberately created.
[01:26:08.332 --> 01:26:12.557]  In order to allegedly make things better, and of course the bust from that.
[01:26:12.557 --> 01:26:20.686]  So we've had all kinds of economic troubles, all kinds of invasions of other countries, bombings of other countries, dronings of other countries.
[01:26:20.686 --> 01:26:25.091]  And I know the neokinds find this very hard to conceive of.
[01:26:25.091 --> 01:26:26.953]  People don't like to be bombed.
[01:26:27.513 --> 01:26:29.114]  They don't like to be droned.
[01:26:29.114 --> 01:26:37.661]  They don't want their countries destroyed and their wedding parties blown up and little children out picking up firewood blown up by a drone.
[01:26:37.661 --> 01:26:40.042]  And well, who cares about that?
[01:26:40.042 --> 01:26:42.844]  That's just collateral damage.
[01:26:42.844 --> 01:26:44.966]  So I think this has been going on for some time.
[01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.647]  I think you're absolutely right.
[01:26:46.647 --> 01:26:54.273]  I think the empire is beginning to crumble around the edges, as all empires do, because they're not economically viable operations.
[01:26:54.913 --> 01:26:56.413]  So, what's happening right now?
[01:26:56.413 --> 01:27:01.575]  I think this op-ed by Putin in the New York Times was really pretty good.
[01:27:01.575 --> 01:27:08.656]  I mean, I'm not a big fan of Putin and everything he's ever been and everything he's ever done, but these days he certainly seems to be speaking the truth.
[01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:12.597]  A friend of mine the other day referred to him as the leader of the free world.
[01:27:12.597 --> 01:27:13.918]  Well, I said, no, that's wrong.
[01:27:13.918 --> 01:27:20.319]  Paul is the leader of the free world, but Putin is acting much more like the leader of the free world than Barack Obama is.
[01:27:20.319 --> 01:27:21.600]  Well, he's acting sane.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.620]  He doesn't want World War III.
[01:27:23.757 --> 01:27:28.039]  No, and you know, one of the things about the neocons is that they seem to have a crazy gene.
[01:27:28.039 --> 01:27:36.282]  I mean, they seem to be slightly wacko, slightly insane, in addition to being warmongers like the Rockefellers and other interest groups.
[01:27:36.282 --> 01:27:42.664]  They really are nutty, and Putin is right to say, look, there's something wrong when you tell the whole world we're exceptional.
[01:27:42.984 --> 01:27:44.265]  We're the best.
[01:27:44.265 --> 01:27:45.907]  The regular rules don't apply to us.
[01:27:45.907 --> 01:27:48.450]  However, we can apply the regular rules to you.
[01:27:48.450 --> 01:27:50.011]  We can bomb you.
[01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:51.553]  We can invade your country.
[01:27:51.553 --> 01:27:59.440]  We can use any kind of weapon on you, like phosphorus, Agent Orange, napalm, and depleted uranium, and so forth.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.122]  And you can't say boo about it.
[01:28:01.122 --> 01:28:03.765]  We're allowed to do it because, you know, we rule the world.
[01:28:03.765 --> 01:28:05.507]  We can conquer anybody, bomb anybody.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:08.181]  Needless to say, people are sick of that.
[01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:09.662]  Putin is exactly right.
[01:28:09.662 --> 01:28:10.343]  It's wrong.
[01:28:10.343 --> 01:28:12.104]  No country should have that view.
[01:28:12.104 --> 01:28:15.587]  Various enterprises, of course, over the course of human history have had that view.
[01:28:15.587 --> 01:28:18.369]  Ancient Babylon, Assyria, Egypt.
[01:28:18.369 --> 01:28:20.651]  More recently, ancient Rome.
[01:28:20.651 --> 01:28:22.412]  More recently, still the British Empire.
[01:28:22.412 --> 01:28:23.573]  Napoleon's empire.
[01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:26.251]  Absolutely.
[01:28:26.251 --> 01:28:33.139]  So at the point we're at, my concern is how will the empire strike back because, God forbid, peace is breaking out here.
[01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:37.043]  I mean, they ought to give Putin a peace prize or Ron Paul a peace prize.
[01:28:37.043 --> 01:28:40.527]  Why not have a movement to recall Obama's peace prize?
[01:28:40.527 --> 01:28:42.950]  I think symbolically that would damage this warmonger.
[01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.327]  Well, it'd be great.
[01:28:44.327 --> 01:28:48.051]  Although, of course, as you know, Alex, there have been some other creeps who have gotten the Peace Prize.
[01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:52.615]  Henry Kissinger and other war criminals besides Obama have gotten it.
[01:28:52.615 --> 01:28:56.920]  But I'd love to see it withdrawn, yes.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:04.107]  But what's happening is it's being withdrawn in the hearts of the American people, in the minds of the American people, and in people all around the world.
[01:29:04.107 --> 01:29:06.050]  No government can stand against that.
[01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:09.111]  That's why they had to try to get a congressional vote.
[01:29:09.111 --> 01:29:22.754]  That's why all the propaganda to try to convince us was a good idea to have yet another anti-Muslim war in the Middle East that would have resulted in the deaths of millions of Christians and other religious minorities in Syria.
[01:29:22.754 --> 01:29:25.854]  So, people are withdrawing their consent from the government.
[01:29:25.854 --> 01:29:28.195]  The government cannot stand against it.
[01:29:28.195 --> 01:29:28.795]  I think we've got
[01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:37.245]  Interesting times ahead from an economic standpoint, but from a political standpoint, I think there's much to look forward to.
[01:29:37.245 --> 01:29:42.530]  Wow, I want to look forward and break down what you think is most important with Lou Rockwell at lourockwell.com.
[01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:44.251]  Straight ahead, we're honored to have him.
[01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:50.016]  We'll be right back to discuss what he expects the power structure to do.
[01:29:50.016 --> 01:29:51.397]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.397 --> 01:29:53.919]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.919 --> 01:29:56.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:01.428 --> 01:31:04.430]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:10.796]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:31:10.796 --> 01:31:17.181]  Listen, there was some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:19.883]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:31:19.883 --> 01:31:21.224]  They're the good guys.

[01:32:01.508 --> 01:32:03.611]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:11.621]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:32:11.621 --> 01:32:16.568]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:32:16.568 --> 01:32:19.872]  The problem is we can't help everybody if every one of us who
[01:32:19.892 --> 01:32:20.672]  We're good to go.
[01:32:44.286 --> 01:32:45.367]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.

[01:32:47.107 --> 01:32:50.129]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:12.695]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:12.695 --> 01:33:16.840]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:20.936 --> 01:33:39.181]  You know you're in deep trouble when your government is run by foreign banks that are above the law, tax-exempt, who lobby for poor people to have their taxes raised, to give bank or bailout money to them, or to be forced to buy overpriced insurance from offshore tax-exempt megacorporations.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:52.835]  And now as Obamacare comes home to roost, as people get laid off to part-time, as all the nightmare unfolds, the collectivization of America takes place, I don't think it's going to go the way Russia went.
[01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:56.018]  And now our government openly backs Al-Qaeda.
[01:33:56.018 --> 01:33:57.880]  How did they think they could get away with it?
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:58.541]  Lew Rockwell
[01:33:59.622 --> 01:34:09.767]  ...of the Von Mies Institute, Ron Paul's former Chief of Staff, after Ron Paul, one of the greatest living libertarian icons out there, honored to have him joining us, video Skype.
[01:34:09.767 --> 01:34:15.809]  There's a lot to talk about in the time we have left, but my concern is how do you expect the empire to strike back?
[01:34:15.809 --> 01:34:23.313]  There's such a collapse in public confidence, 91% in Reuters poll against this, 500 to 1 phone calls in Congress against it.
[01:34:24.907 --> 01:34:32.769]  What do you expect the kleptocrats to do face down with a whole world that's completely fed up?
[01:34:32.769 --> 01:34:35.249]  Well, they don't know what to do.
[01:34:35.249 --> 01:34:36.710]  I think they're going to have to back down.
[01:34:36.710 --> 01:34:47.072]  We only have to look at their reaction to the fact that nobody in America and nobody in the world bought their lies about why there should be a new war on Syria.
[01:34:47.777 --> 01:34:48.678]  Nobody!
[01:34:48.678 --> 01:34:50.279]  And they didn't clearly know what to do.
[01:34:50.279 --> 01:34:52.600]  They kept giving us the same propaganda.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.362]  They kept repeating it, and they had the whole mainstream media, of course, on their side.
[01:34:56.362 --> 01:35:01.486]  Thank goodness, Alex, for alternative media like you.
[01:35:01.486 --> 01:35:03.527]  This is where people are getting their information.
[01:35:03.527 --> 01:35:08.150]  But I also think more and more people are just correctly distrusting the government.
[01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:14.312]  They're beginning to agree with the old British rule was never believe anything until it's been officially denied.
[01:35:14.312 --> 01:35:27.938]  I think for example what the great Edward Snowden did in alerting us to what was going on with the NSA and there's still of course amazing stuff coming out from Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald and the Guardian and so forth.
[01:35:27.938 --> 01:35:32.780]  So there's I think that has been a huge undermining of the government.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.501]  I think people don't trust the government.
[01:35:34.921 --> 01:35:36.382]  They don't like the government.
[01:35:36.382 --> 01:35:38.003]  They don't want to be felt up at the airport.
[01:35:38.003 --> 01:35:40.585]  I mean, they don't want their taxes raised.
[01:35:40.585 --> 01:35:43.767]  Anybody who's looking at Obamacare is terrified by it.
[01:35:43.767 --> 01:35:46.549]  I noticed they haven't kept to their own schedule.
[01:35:46.549 --> 01:35:48.751]  You know, it was all supposed to have happened by now.
[01:35:48.751 --> 01:35:58.277]  So I think even the government is slightly afraid of what the people's reaction is going to be when they see what a scam, what an expensive disaster, but really a criminal enterprise.
[01:35:58.277 --> 01:36:03.841]  Obamacare is written by the big pharmaceutical companies and the big insurance companies, health insurance companies.
[01:36:04.261 --> 01:36:09.885]  wrote that legislation to benefit themselves, certainly not to benefit the rest of us.
[01:36:09.885 --> 01:36:11.466]  So that's coming ahead.
[01:36:11.466 --> 01:36:12.607]  People are terrified of it.
[01:36:12.607 --> 01:36:14.408]  They're right to be terrified of it.
[01:36:14.408 --> 01:36:18.931]  Everything the government is doing is an attack on the average Joe.
[01:36:18.931 --> 01:36:21.233]  I mean, that's the whole thing.
[01:36:21.233 --> 01:36:25.016]  And also, more and more people are realizing what you just talked about.
[01:36:25.556 --> 01:36:27.659]  About the whole bankocracy that we live in.
[01:36:27.659 --> 01:36:34.948]  We live in a rule by big banks, big international banks and cohorts with the central bank, the Federal Reserve.
[01:36:34.948 --> 01:36:38.272]  But again, people are beginning to become wise to this.
[01:36:38.272 --> 01:36:44.780]  It's why it's so important that we all try to keep that process going so that people will withdraw their consent.
[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:52.267]  Man, because the government is only a small minority, really a tiny minority, if we consider the real bad guys.
[01:36:52.267 --> 01:36:57.493]  I mean, the average fireman or post office guy is not our enemy.
[01:36:57.493 --> 01:36:59.655]  But if you look at the top of the government, the sort of 1%
[01:37:01.236 --> 01:37:06.201]  Of the population that is part of the government, part of the oligarchy.
[01:37:06.201 --> 01:37:07.902]  We far outnumber them.
[01:37:07.902 --> 01:37:10.084]  We don't have to let them push us around.
[01:37:10.084 --> 01:37:12.506]  We don't have to let them terrorize us.
[01:37:12.506 --> 01:37:17.271]  And if we refuse to have it happen, they actually can't get away with it.
[01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:21.714]  So maybe we'll see Bernanke having to go to McDonald's to get a job.
[01:37:21.714 --> 01:37:21.955]  That's my...
[01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:24.858]  That would be my ideal.
[01:37:24.858 --> 01:37:40.635]  Well you and Ron Paul and others have always said that when the collapse comes, it's key that we've been there the whole time, pointing out their inconsistencies, pointing out their lies, pointing out that they exempt themselves from what they do to us, that they're the enemy, so they can't pose as the savior.
[01:37:40.635 --> 01:37:41.637]  And we've done that.
[01:37:41.637 --> 01:37:42.438]  They were arrogant.
[01:37:43.376 --> 01:37:52.841]  For decades denying our existence while we basically expose them and now they are discovering that they're no longer the dominant media.
[01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:54.401]  They are basically dead.
[01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:57.403]  The establishment has lost all credibility.
[01:37:57.403 --> 01:38:04.706]  It was gone for a while, but now the Emperor's, you know, new clothes issue is clearer than ever.
[01:38:04.706 --> 01:38:09.769]  How do you expect them to strike back against the real media and we the people?
[01:38:09.769 --> 01:38:11.770]  What concerns you on that front, Lew Rockwell?
[01:38:12.708 --> 01:38:15.190]  Well, certainly these people are capable of anything.
[01:38:15.190 --> 01:38:23.917]  I always think that if they haven't committed some crime, it's either because they felt they couldn't get away with it, or they didn't think of it, or they thought it was imprudent for themselves.
[01:38:23.917 --> 01:38:27.720]  But they never have the reaction, uh-oh, better not do that, that would be wrong.
[01:38:29.201 --> 01:38:32.503]  That's never the reaction in foreign affairs or in domestic affairs.
[01:38:32.503 --> 01:38:35.084]  But they're not all powerful.
[01:38:35.084 --> 01:38:38.366]  The gun only takes you so far.
[01:38:38.366 --> 01:38:43.009]  And there are too few of them to be putting a gun at everybody's head and ordering us what to do.
[01:38:43.009 --> 01:38:48.172]  And when you start to see the regime collapse, and this has been true in other countries, they lose their own people.
[01:38:48.652 --> 01:38:55.598]  Their own government employees turn against them because the decent ones do not want to be part of what's going on.
[01:38:55.598 --> 01:38:59.661]  And they don't have any moral authority.
[01:38:59.661 --> 01:39:01.783]  And they are very, very vulnerable.
[01:39:01.783 --> 01:39:04.525]  They're going to become increasingly vulnerable.
[01:39:04.525 --> 01:39:07.908]  And it's our job, again, to, as you just mentioned,
[01:39:08.948 --> 01:39:10.690]  Put out the correct word.
[01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:12.472]  Teach people what the truth is.
[01:39:12.472 --> 01:39:14.775]  Explain how you're being ripped off.
[01:39:14.775 --> 01:39:17.298]  Explain why that does not have to be.
[01:39:17.298 --> 01:39:20.481]  And we're in an entirely new situation.
[01:39:20.481 --> 01:39:22.384]  There's never been a government as big as the U.S.
[01:39:22.384 --> 01:39:23.585]  government.
[01:39:23.585 --> 01:39:25.847]  But also, a bureaucracy has got troubles.
[01:39:26.388 --> 01:39:31.451]  Bureaucracy is, we all know, a very inefficient form of human organization.
[01:39:31.451 --> 01:39:38.274]  We have the biggest, most complicated, richest, most powerful, most rotten bureaucracy ever, the U.S.
[01:39:38.274 --> 01:39:38.895]  government.
[01:39:38.895 --> 01:39:44.638]  And it stretches all over the world, many different countries, and it's very, very powerful.
[01:39:44.638 --> 01:39:46.298]  But it's not all powerful.
[01:39:46.298 --> 01:39:48.760]  And we're already seeing the thing begin to crumble.
[01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.782]  It's at least crumbling around the edges.
[01:39:51.782 --> 01:39:58.929]  So we ought to get our non-violent hammer and chisel and knock those edges a little bit.
[01:39:58.929 --> 01:39:59.729]  Let the truth in.
[01:39:59.729 --> 01:40:01.931]  Let the power of the truth in.
[01:40:01.931 --> 01:40:04.674]  Truth will win out.
[01:40:04.674 --> 01:40:06.335]  The lies and the deceit
[01:40:07.276 --> 01:40:14.440]  And the disasters of these people promulgate on the rest of us to enrich themselves, to empower themselves.
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.661]  We don't have to let them get away with it.
[01:40:16.661 --> 01:40:18.942]  I predict they are not going to get away with it.
[01:40:18.942 --> 01:40:24.545]  The economics of the empire is going to bring it down as Ron Paul has been talking about for decades.
[01:40:25.405 --> 01:40:28.786]  This sort of economic organization can't last.
[01:40:28.786 --> 01:40:33.987]  We're going to see the dollar no longer be the world currency, so everybody ought to own some gold.
[01:40:33.987 --> 01:40:51.491]  We're going to see all other kinds of things coming apart, whether it's the IMF, whether that's the European Union, NATO, the World Bank, all these John Maynard Keynes organizations set up after World War II are coming to an end exactly as Henry Haslett predicted in the 1940s.
[01:40:53.551 --> 01:40:56.292]  Showed what was going to happen and it's indeed happening.
[01:40:56.292 --> 01:40:58.393]  So they don't have economics on their side.
[01:40:58.393 --> 01:41:00.234]  They don't have morality on their side.
[01:41:00.234 --> 01:41:01.994]  They don't have history on their side.
[01:41:01.994 --> 01:41:02.935]  They do have a gun.
[01:41:02.935 --> 01:41:04.455]  They have a gun.
[01:41:04.455 --> 01:41:07.136]  But again, the gun can only do so much.
[01:41:07.136 --> 01:41:11.097]  The power of truth and right can defeat these people.
[01:41:11.097 --> 01:41:19.160]  And I think people, I think future historians will look back at this time and see this is when the real counter-revolution began.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:20.361]  And don't we need it?
[01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:22.322]  So this is really 1776.
[01:41:22.322 --> 01:41:29.265]  I think you could say 2013 is the year the world woke up.
[01:41:29.265 --> 01:41:32.827]  And it may take a year, it may take five years.
[01:41:32.827 --> 01:41:37.029]  The globalist New World Order is like a rotten heart.
[01:41:37.029 --> 01:41:40.250]  It could go another five years or it could blow up tomorrow.
[01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:49.415]  I just hope that in the collapse of the empire we don't have a thermal nuclear war because imagine if other empires on the verge of collapse would have had these planet
[01:41:50.327 --> 01:41:51.168]  We're good to go.
[01:42:18.570 --> 01:42:26.016]  Cooler minds prevail, but take Rand Paul coming out and saying, you know, it looks like the rebels are behind it and we don't want to be behind Al Qaeda.
[01:42:26.016 --> 01:42:28.578]  And Ted Cruz saying we don't want to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[01:42:28.578 --> 01:42:36.224]  And Ron Paul saying, boldly, he thinks that the Syria situation was a false flag, which has been pretty much proven to be 99 percent.
[01:42:36.224 --> 01:42:38.005]  Not just in motive, but in facts.
[01:42:38.005 --> 01:42:41.127]  And Pat Buchanan coming out and saying Gulf of Tonkin, false flag.
[01:42:42.168 --> 01:42:45.090]  And to have Rush Limbaugh come out and pretty much say that.
[01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:55.039]  I mean, when you see that, and you see Republicans now, who've been Republicans, coming out and saying, you know, what's wrong with these Republicans on this war?
[01:42:55.039 --> 01:42:55.799]  No, no, no.
[01:42:55.799 --> 01:42:57.941]  When the left's not really doing that with Obama.
[01:42:57.941 --> 01:43:00.083]  I mean, I'm seeing a major sea change.
[01:43:01.488 --> 01:43:02.269]  It's absolutely true.
[01:43:02.269 --> 01:43:03.189]  You know what it is, Alex?
[01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:08.533]  It's like, think of the government as being John Kerry or some other rich guy in a very expensive sweater.
[01:43:08.533 --> 01:43:12.576]  And there's some little guy down at the bottom and he's starting to pull on a thread.
[01:43:12.576 --> 01:43:14.878]  And Kerry thinks, well, that's entirely irrelevant.
[01:43:14.878 --> 01:43:17.860]  But it's not irrelevant because soon the whole thing is going to come off him.
[01:43:17.860 --> 01:43:20.642]  So that's what's happening.
[01:43:20.642 --> 01:43:26.526]  We're just at the very, very beginning of an historic period, not only in American history, but in world history.
[01:43:26.526 --> 01:43:29.228]  We do have to fear these people and their thermonuclear weapons.
[01:43:29.788 --> 01:43:46.177]  But I think that, you know, and you just pointed it out, I think more and more people in the military would refuse to, as my goodness they certainly should refuse, to mass murder people with atomic weapons just because some banker in Washington orders them to.
[01:43:46.177 --> 01:43:56.363]  So just like there were soldiers in this current situation who said, you know, I'm not going to go to Syria and fight on the side of Al-Qaeda and kill the Christians.
[01:43:57.063 --> 01:44:05.789]  So, when you have the military, which happened during the Vietnam War too, the military is starting to mutiny, starting to rebel against its orders.
[01:44:05.789 --> 01:44:07.210]  Very, very good thing.
[01:44:07.210 --> 01:44:17.437]  So, I think, you know, nothing is for sure, of course, and we're dealing with some of the worst people in the history of the human race, capable of anything.
[01:44:17.437 --> 01:44:18.558]  So, this is a struggle.
[01:44:19.418 --> 01:44:23.940]  But it's always been a struggle, a struggle between power and market, all throughout human history.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:30.623]  So the struggle has intensified, but now, for the first time in a very long time, the good guys have got the advantage.
[01:44:30.623 --> 01:44:32.104]  We have to push that.
[01:44:32.104 --> 01:44:33.785]  We have to take the advantage.
[01:44:33.785 --> 01:44:44.410]  We have to make sure that we show the truth about the creeps who oppose us, what their plans are, how they want to hurt regular people to enrich themselves, how they love starting wars, they love killing people.
[01:44:44.410 --> 01:44:46.051]  They're a very nasty bunch.
[01:44:47.512 --> 01:44:53.515]  But good isn't the great majority and we have to do our job.
[01:44:53.515 --> 01:44:54.495]  Nothing is automatic.
[01:44:54.495 --> 01:44:56.716]  We can't just sit back and expect it to happen.
[01:44:56.716 --> 01:45:05.581]  But if we all educate ourselves, if we all try to educate others, if we all try to spread the ideas of freedom, I think we'll win.
[01:45:05.581 --> 01:45:07.102]  Speaking of their
[01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:12.872]  They're in game strategy that they've all basically written about.
[01:45:12.872 --> 01:45:21.977]  They have decided to make the singularity in computers and robotics and manufacturing and industry an anti-human program where we're not needed.
[01:45:21.977 --> 01:45:30.561]  And so for the first time, oligarchs can use machines to get rid of the labor that they've never really wanted.
[01:45:31.812 --> 01:45:44.819]  And so they're almost buying into a Karl Marx type idea, but instead of people having to work one day a week and living like kings, they've decided to bring in agenda 21 to have government siphon off so much resources to make us poor, to make us peasants.
[01:45:44.819 --> 01:45:46.080]  They all write books about this.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:48.782]  It's how they admit their crimes.
[01:45:48.782 --> 01:45:50.763]  And then now the socialists over in France...
[01:45:51.563 --> 01:46:05.889]  He's come out, the president said, robots replacing French workers will get France going again and let the socialist class, who's exempt from taxes as they've been caught, have 100 plus percent taxes on the nouveau riche and the middle class.
[01:46:05.889 --> 01:46:11.392]  And so as all that happens, they're going to go to automation, automated factories, automated drones.
[01:46:11.392 --> 01:46:13.393]  Same thing MIT and the Pentagon say.
[01:46:14.153 --> 01:46:18.496]  Uh, is that soon it won't matter if the troops won't fire the cruise missiles.
[01:46:18.496 --> 01:46:22.338]  It'll be up to one technocrat, as they call themselves, to launch it.
[01:46:22.338 --> 01:46:32.904]  So I think it's important that the instinct of human survival takes control of the technocracy now to empower the free market, empower the individual in the market of ideas.
[01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:45.611]  Uh, through free will, rather than let these monsters get the technocracy, because they admit what you've said, that history's against them, but they believe that the holy grail of the sentient robot is going to save them.
[01:46:45.611 --> 01:46:46.912]  Uh, they're quite delusional.
[01:46:46.912 --> 01:46:51.115]  I believe, as the web was meant to control us, we're now using it to destroy them.
[01:46:51.115 --> 01:46:54.057]  I believe they will fall into their own pit, Lou Rockwell.
[01:46:54.875 --> 01:47:00.380]  Well, I think it's true, although I wouldn't mind replacing Francois Hollande with a robot.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:01.801]  That would be a step forward.
[01:47:01.801 --> 01:47:05.364]  But, you know, these are, as you say, socialists, they're fascists.
[01:47:05.364 --> 01:47:09.187]  They don't actually understand anything about human productivity.
[01:47:09.187 --> 01:47:11.409]  They're anti-human productivity.
[01:47:11.409 --> 01:47:13.751]  And they may have pipe dreams about this kind of thing.
[01:47:13.751 --> 01:47:17.394]  And, you know, I think it's always important to remember nothing is beyond them.
[01:47:17.934 --> 01:47:26.077]  I mean, you know, they would happily commit horrendous crimes against humanity if they thought it would do them good, and they certainly have in the past.
[01:47:26.077 --> 01:47:28.658]  So that's the way they are.
[01:47:28.658 --> 01:47:30.578]  I don't think they can get away with this.
[01:47:30.578 --> 01:47:34.560]  I don't think from an economic standpoint or a technological standpoint they can do it.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.401]  But, again, it requires us fighting them.
[01:47:38.281 --> 01:47:44.625]  I don't mean violently fighting them, but fighting them with ideas, telling people the truth about them.
[01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:46.406]  They can't stand the truth.
[01:47:46.406 --> 01:47:48.807]  I mean, they're like the witch and the wizard of Oz.
[01:47:48.807 --> 01:47:53.830]  The truth is sprinkling water on them, and they all go up in smoke.
[01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:54.691]  I'm melting!
[01:47:54.691 --> 01:47:55.271]  I'm melting!
[01:47:55.271 --> 01:47:56.031]  Great analogy.
[01:47:56.031 --> 01:47:57.692]  Let me ask you this, Lew Rockwell, in closing.
[01:47:57.692 --> 01:47:58.613]  We're so thankful for your time.
[01:47:58.613 --> 01:48:02.275]  I know you've been a very, very busy guy, and we're honored to have you here with us.
[01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:03.196]  LewRockwell.com.
[01:48:04.116 --> 01:48:10.927]  I now look at the body language of Obama, the Republican Senators as well, McCain, Graham, Mendez, the Democrat.
[01:48:12.222 --> 01:48:13.623]  And I've studied history.
[01:48:13.623 --> 01:48:14.763]  I'm obsessed with it.
[01:48:14.763 --> 01:48:16.304]  I've seen a lot of film reels and things.
[01:48:16.304 --> 01:48:19.226]  I've never seen a more mentally ill looking bunch.
[01:48:19.226 --> 01:48:23.268]  I think that's what concerns me most, is they look like Hitler's high command.
[01:48:23.268 --> 01:48:31.032]  And the film reels I've seen in the last six months of the war, some of the last film reels, they look very freaked out and haunted.
[01:48:31.032 --> 01:48:36.334]  And I think the special interests, like Nixon said, there's so many special interests that aren't even connected.
[01:48:36.334 --> 01:48:40.816]  They just know they get more money and power if they do A, even though B leads to nuclear war.
[01:48:42.357 --> 01:48:47.580]  But it's scary, but also makes me feel really good to see that their morale is super low.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:49.921]  But do you agree that they look completely whacked out of their mind?
[01:48:49.921 --> 01:48:51.482]  Oh, I think they are.
[01:48:51.482 --> 01:48:58.805]  You know, doing evil as a regular, as your daily bread, is not good for the human spirit.
[01:48:58.805 --> 01:49:00.646]  I mean, obviously that's correct.
[01:49:00.646 --> 01:49:02.887]  We know that from religion and from history.
[01:49:02.887 --> 01:49:05.249]  It's just, it's not good for people.
[01:49:05.249 --> 01:49:07.230]  It's not good for people to kill other people.
[01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:09.751]  So these guys have all been killing people all their lives.
[01:49:10.771 --> 01:49:14.292]  Both in the military and probably otherwise as well.
[01:49:14.292 --> 01:49:21.853]  So yeah, they're sick and they also would like to be getting hosannas rather than getting the raspberry at their town hall meetings.
[01:49:21.853 --> 01:49:22.853]  They can't stand it.
[01:49:22.853 --> 01:49:27.694]  They feel themselves to be the greatest people in the history of the world and we all better obey them.
[01:49:27.694 --> 01:49:33.175]  And when that doesn't happen, they do begin indeed to crumble just like, as you say, Hitler in the bunker.
[01:49:33.175 --> 01:49:35.576]  So let's hope we see more of that.
[01:49:36.618 --> 01:49:48.233]  Well, what Putin, who again, I don't romanticize, you're absolutely right, but our leaders are so evil, he looks good, and when in comparison, it's like jumping into a latrine that's only half full rather than overflowing.
[01:49:51.206 --> 01:49:57.608]  He did the right thing saying, you people running this are not invincible, you're not exceptional, except for being exceptionally evil.
[01:49:57.608 --> 01:49:58.769]  Stop thinking you're God.
[01:49:58.769 --> 01:50:01.410]  He is saying the Emperor's butt naked.
[01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:02.950]  He is saying you're a fraud.
[01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:04.591]  He's saying you're not invincible.
[01:50:04.591 --> 01:50:07.692]  That's exactly what they need to be hearing before they blow the planet up.
[01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:10.540]  And he's actually speaking for the people of the world.
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:21.164]  I mean, just like the government needs consent here at home, at least tacit consent from the American people to do their evil, so they need consent from the world in order to have their empire.
[01:50:21.164 --> 01:50:33.548]  But the world is withdrawing, just as Americans are withdrawing their consent, the world is withdrawing its consent, whether it's Brazil or Russia or India or China, and all sorts of small countries too, of course.
[01:50:34.168 --> 01:50:36.170]  ...are not wanting to be ruled by the U.S.
[01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:37.311]  They don't want to be invaded.
[01:50:37.311 --> 01:50:38.211]  They don't want to be bombed.
[01:50:38.211 --> 01:50:38.992]  Final question.
[01:50:38.992 --> 01:50:42.675]  How long does the empire have in your gut, Lew Rockwell?
[01:50:42.675 --> 01:50:47.439]  Well, I think it all depends at bottom on the dollar.
[01:50:47.439 --> 01:50:50.701]  If I had to take a guess, I would say it's got between 5 and 10 years left.
[01:50:50.701 --> 01:50:51.542]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:50:51.542 --> 01:50:59.208]  Let's do a final segment with you and then I promise Julio Christian, good news, President Bush owned all the callers we're going to get to you.
[01:51:01.351 --> 01:51:03.352]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[01:52:59.944 --> 01:53:04.665]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[01:53:04.665 --> 01:53:13.348]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[01:53:13.348 --> 01:53:15.269]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:53:15.269 --> 01:53:16.169]  We are what we
[01:53:16.169 --> 01:53:16.929]  We're good to go.

[01:54:07.643 --> 01:54:09.844]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:23.606]  In Colorado, multiple Democratic lawmakers were removed from the statehouse after passing gun confiscation laws.
[01:54:23.606 --> 01:54:30.730]  And now gun confiscation type individuals are facing a recall in Virginia and other states.
[01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:31.751]  That's the answer.
[01:54:31.751 --> 01:54:34.052]  Get on the offense.
[01:54:34.052 --> 01:54:35.633]  Big things have small beginnings.
[01:54:35.633 --> 01:54:38.295]  Briefly, before we finish up with Lou Rockwell, start the next hour and go to your calls.
[01:54:39.682 --> 01:54:41.783]  I am wearing a shirt, if you're watching us on TV.
[01:54:41.783 --> 01:54:43.284]  It just came in last night.
[01:54:43.284 --> 01:54:44.865]  I designed it.
[01:54:44.865 --> 01:54:52.969]  And it is the wheel of death, the wheel of failure, as the O. And it says Obamacare.
[01:54:52.969 --> 01:54:54.169]  InfoWars.com.
[01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:57.251]  On the back it says, death panels are cool.
[01:54:59.733 --> 01:55:06.957]  And so, I think it's a very important video, and in the word cool, the two O's are the Obama symbol.
[01:55:06.957 --> 01:55:09.078]  The rising sun.
[01:55:09.078 --> 01:55:09.639]  The sun of...
[01:55:11.144 --> 01:55:12.586]  Enslavement, I guess you could say it.
[01:55:12.586 --> 01:55:25.999]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, we have the great pro-pure water filters, the purifier water, key to health, with the 10% off promo code water, the great non-hybrid, non-GMO seed center with all the best products right there, the books, the videos.

[01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:37.632]  So I salute you all.
[01:55:37.632 --> 01:55:42.458]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:42.458 --> 01:55:49.506]  And the mailing address and all the details are also on the site or linked through at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:55:49.506 --> 01:55:51.148]  Lou Rockwell finishing up.
[01:55:52.577 --> 01:55:55.798]  I want to ask you about, I mean, I agree, five, ten years.
[01:55:55.798 --> 01:56:12.045]  Empires can go on a long time, they've got nuclear weapons, but at the same time, if there's a complete loss of confidence, you could have them fall like Ceausescu, but then you're going to have all the other collectivists and the hundreds of millions that are domesticated flooding back in, not knowing what to do.
[01:56:12.045 --> 01:56:14.766]  So as Ron Paul has said, it's going to be a process.
[01:56:14.766 --> 01:56:22.009]  What is your advice on the times we're going into right now and how we can have a peaceful end to the kleptocratic empire?
[01:56:23.399 --> 01:56:26.281]  Well, I think we have to first of all set an example.
[01:56:26.281 --> 01:56:35.105]  Weapons, killing, poison gas, atomic weapons, depleted uranium, all the rest, you know, starvation sanctions, all the rest of that stuff.
[01:56:35.105 --> 01:56:37.206]  Those are the tools of the bad guys.
[01:56:37.206 --> 01:56:38.387]  Those are not our tools.
[01:56:38.387 --> 01:56:39.708]  We're not violent.
[01:56:39.708 --> 01:56:41.028]  We believe in peace.
[01:56:41.028 --> 01:56:44.951]  We believe in peace in personal senses as well as international.
[01:56:44.951 --> 01:56:50.934]  Ron Paul always says the golden rule of foreign policy and the golden rule in our interpersonal relations.
[01:56:51.554 --> 01:56:53.836]  So I think that's the most important thing.
[01:56:53.836 --> 01:56:59.159]  Second most important thing is to learn about some economics and history and learn what the heck is going on.
[01:56:59.159 --> 01:57:01.701]  I think it's a great idea to have some gold.
[01:57:01.701 --> 01:57:03.802]  I think it's a great idea to have some food.
[01:57:03.802 --> 01:57:08.245]  I think it's a great idea to be prepared for anything.
[01:57:08.245 --> 01:57:11.868]  But the most important thing is be a beacon.
[01:57:12.904 --> 01:57:15.265]  For your fellow men.
[01:57:15.265 --> 01:57:23.150]  Shine forth with the ideas of freedom and liberty and all the things that have been great about America now being crushed.
[01:57:23.150 --> 01:57:25.891]  Those ideas still exist even if they're somewhat underground.
[01:57:25.891 --> 01:57:27.592]  We can fly that flag.
[01:57:27.592 --> 01:57:29.693]  We can talk about those ideas.
[01:57:29.693 --> 01:57:31.054]  We can read those books.
[01:57:31.054 --> 01:57:32.575]  We can educate our children.
[01:57:32.575 --> 01:57:34.175]  Take them out of the public schools.
[01:57:34.175 --> 01:57:34.876]  Homeschool them.
[01:57:35.737 --> 01:57:38.520]  Many, many things that we can do as individuals.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.222]  Get out of debt to the extent you can.
[01:57:40.222 --> 01:57:45.769]  We have to make a total break with the kleptocratic, crony-capitalist, anti-free market system.
[01:57:45.769 --> 01:57:47.131]  Well, they're the enemy.
[01:57:47.131 --> 01:57:48.652]  And so they only want to crush us.
[01:57:48.652 --> 01:57:51.015]  They want to be a ball and chain around our leg.
[01:57:51.015 --> 01:57:52.237]  We don't want that.
[01:57:52.237 --> 01:57:54.560]  So we should go in the opposite direction from those people.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:58.523]  And I think there are going to be some very exciting times ahead.
[01:57:58.523 --> 01:58:04.368]  The people will be telling their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren about what's going to be happening now.
[01:58:04.368 --> 01:58:06.269]  And it's going to be very exciting.
[01:58:06.269 --> 01:58:07.510]  I don't say that it's easy.
[01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:09.292]  It's going to be maybe horrible.
[01:58:09.292 --> 01:58:10.433]  But I believe we will win.
[01:58:12.185 --> 01:58:16.690]  By the way, speaking of that, the developments will lead probably to a recall of John McCain.
[01:58:16.690 --> 01:58:18.533]  It's McGahn, Breitbart reporting.
[01:58:18.533 --> 01:58:25.721]  Official Arizona GOP body has his formal rebuke of John McCain, says he's abandoned the GOP principles.
[01:58:25.721 --> 01:58:29.385]  So it looks like the GOP might be trying to find their original principles right there, Lou.
[01:58:30.185 --> 01:58:31.546]  Well, I'd love to see McCain gone.
[01:58:31.546 --> 01:58:34.129]  I don't know what the GOP principles are.
[01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:38.894]  Seems to me ever since Lincoln they've been pretty bad, but McCain ought to be definitely sent home.
[01:58:38.894 --> 01:58:40.256]  Thank you, Lou Rockwell.
[01:58:40.256 --> 01:58:42.078]  Next hour coming up.
[01:58:42.078 --> 01:58:46.783]  Infowars.com, GCNlive.com, lourockwell.com.
[01:58:46.783 --> 01:58:47.343]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.343 --> 01:58:48.124]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:48.124 --> 01:58:48.505]  Your calls.
[01:58:50.737 --> 01:58:55.460]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:58.581]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:58:58.581 --> 01:59:04.145]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:59:04.145 --> 01:59:06.086]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:59:06.086 --> 01:59:07.707]  We are what we eat.
[01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:12.389]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:59:12.389 --> 01:59:16.612]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:59:16.612 --> 01:59:18.873]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:59:19.153 --> 01:59:25.382]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:59:56.217 --> 01:59:58.980]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:10.420]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.021]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.021 --> 02:00:13.562]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.562 --> 02:00:17.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:22.065]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.065 --> 02:00:26.867]  Alright, we do first-time callers a lot, so new people can get in, but we're doing everybody today.
[02:00:26.867 --> 02:00:29.909]  One of our frequent callers usually goes up first, and I'm going to go to
[02:00:31.527 --> 02:00:33.649]  Everybody else is patiently holding Owen and others.
[02:00:33.649 --> 02:00:36.593]  I'm going to get to all of them before our next guest comes on.
[02:00:36.593 --> 02:00:39.696]  Let's talk to Julio on Syria GMO.
[02:00:39.696 --> 02:00:40.237]  You're on the air.
[02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:46.052]  First off, Alex, a quick PSA to anyone in Chicago.
[02:00:46.052 --> 02:00:47.913]  Lindsey Graham, Ms.
[02:00:47.913 --> 02:00:59.344]  Lindsey Graham, will be speaking Monday morning at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, which is the Council on Foreign Relations' sister group, or their little minion group.
[02:00:59.344 --> 02:01:02.928]  But Monday morning, he's going to give an update on Congress.
[02:01:03.368 --> 02:01:13.933]  So if anyone wants to voice or vent or do whatever they, you know, peacefully want to, Mr. Graham, I highly suggest going to see him at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
[02:01:13.933 --> 02:01:14.773]  I think Ms.
[02:01:14.773 --> 02:01:16.454]  Graham ought to marry Mr. Maddow.
[02:01:18.328 --> 02:01:22.149]  Well, they can do it at Boys Town in Chicago.
[02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:23.550]  Quickly, Alex, a couple of points.
[02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:41.976]  Number one, Executive Order 13650, a new executive order that our lovely Presidente Barry Satoro signed a couple of weeks ago, Improving Chemical Facility and Safety and Security, is the name of the executive order.
[02:01:42.436 --> 02:01:52.658]  And basically all chemical plants, nuclear plants in the United States are now under government and under the guidance of Homeland Security.
[02:01:52.658 --> 02:01:53.138]  Oh no, no.
[02:01:53.138 --> 02:01:56.459]  Homeland Security is seizing everything.
[02:01:56.459 --> 02:02:02.720]  They're telling concert venues that you can't operate unless you grab everybody's genitals.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:07.041]  So I can't go to concerts because now everywhere you go they literally grab your genitals.
[02:02:07.041 --> 02:02:08.642]  The new American handshake should be
[02:02:09.742 --> 02:02:13.264]  That you should wear your genitals on the outside to show you're not a terrorist.
[02:02:13.264 --> 02:02:19.366]  Instead of like, like in the old days, and then you would hold your hands up and wave to show I don't have weapons, I'm a friend.
[02:02:19.366 --> 02:02:22.648]  You know, at 200 yards away, and then you would shake hands to show you were a friend.
[02:02:22.648 --> 02:02:28.710]  In the new America, you present your, I'm sorry, but it's actually probably gonna be the new truth.
[02:02:28.710 --> 02:02:34.613]  You, you will actually, you will get over the hood of the car for a proctology exam by the officer.
[02:02:34.613 --> 02:02:36.254]  So, uh, I think it's a great idea.
[02:02:36.254 --> 02:02:37.534]  What do you think?
[02:02:37.534 --> 02:02:38.875]  Lindsey Graham could train the police.
[02:02:40.481 --> 02:02:41.042]  I think so.
[02:02:41.042 --> 02:02:42.323]  I think so.
[02:02:42.323 --> 02:02:44.946]  And another thing quickly, Alex, the U.S.
[02:02:44.946 --> 02:02:56.239]  versus Jokar, I saw this on Krypton.org a couple of weeks ago, but our lovely United States government has assisted a motion for a protective order.
[02:02:56.239 --> 02:03:01.024]  So basically all information regarding the trial is under a protective order, so
[02:03:02.145 --> 02:03:02.746]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[02:03:02.746 --> 02:03:08.513]  They declared national security on this trial so he doesn't go up and say, I'm innocent, that was CIA.
[02:03:08.513 --> 02:03:10.655]  I mean, he's already saying that.
[02:03:10.655 --> 02:03:13.679]  So they can't let that come out because they did the bombing and it all blew up in their face.
[02:03:13.679 --> 02:03:15.441]  Imagine how mad they are at us.
[02:03:15.441 --> 02:03:16.742]  That's really our big coup this year.
[02:03:17.443 --> 02:03:20.225]  ...was covering that, breaking it, and Badandi, and all the rest of it.
[02:03:20.225 --> 02:03:21.866]  That's like risking our lives.
[02:03:21.866 --> 02:03:23.247]  I don't like doing stuff like that.
[02:03:23.247 --> 02:03:24.107]  It's really pushing it.
[02:03:24.107 --> 02:03:25.348]  But, hey, c'est la vie.
[02:03:25.348 --> 02:03:26.849]  Somebody's gotta do it.
[02:03:26.849 --> 02:03:30.371]  And, uh, boy-vayage to Alex, maybe, if we keep doing this.
[02:03:30.371 --> 02:03:32.793]  Boy-vayage to Valhalla.
[02:03:32.793 --> 02:03:34.454]  Uh, the Valkyries gonna take me up there?
[02:03:34.454 --> 02:03:35.474]  I don't know.
[02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:37.555]  Sometimes I think I deserve it when they come after me.
[02:03:37.555 --> 02:03:42.178]  But the point is, is that all this is happening, and it's incredibly historical.
[02:03:42.178 --> 02:03:43.199]  And, yeah, I forgot.
[02:03:43.199 --> 02:03:44.540]  National security on that?
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.181]  National security on shooting?
[02:03:47.318 --> 02:03:49.721]  Their friend, remember they actually, in fact, will you print me that?
[02:03:49.721 --> 02:03:58.371]  They've declared, you know, made the FBI killing secret and declared national security.
[02:03:58.371 --> 02:04:02.275]  Because, I mean, that was in the news when it happened, but, or a few weeks after.
[02:04:02.275 --> 02:04:03.216]  I want to be able to show that.
[02:04:04.056 --> 02:04:04.916]  I feel really bad though.
[02:04:04.916 --> 02:04:08.458]  I'm sitting here talking about this and his wife's coming up with us in about 20 minutes.
[02:04:08.458 --> 02:04:10.159]  So thank you so much, Julio.
[02:04:10.159 --> 02:04:15.562]  Now when we come back, I'm going to go quickly to Owen and President Bush.
[02:04:15.562 --> 02:04:17.302]  This is getting ridiculous.
[02:04:17.302 --> 02:04:19.504]  People using whatever name they want.
[02:04:19.504 --> 02:04:20.384]  How about President Obama?
[02:04:20.384 --> 02:04:21.665]  How about President Clinton?
[02:04:21.665 --> 02:04:25.426]  I think he deserves another Peace Prize.
[02:04:25.426 --> 02:04:28.768]  And then Christian and then Rhonda.
[02:04:28.768 --> 02:04:32.470]  We're going to talk to everybody coming up after this quick break.
[02:04:34.215 --> 02:04:35.296]  I love that sound right there.
[02:04:35.296 --> 02:04:35.596]  What is it?
[02:04:35.596 --> 02:04:37.557]  It's like a big engine turning on.
[02:04:37.557 --> 02:04:39.018]  The engine of liberty.
[02:04:39.018 --> 02:04:40.059]  It's firing up.
[02:04:40.059 --> 02:04:42.881]  The gremlins are scaring in fear.
[02:04:42.881 --> 02:04:47.083]  They want to dominate us because they're so afraid of us.
[02:04:47.083 --> 02:04:48.604]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:04:48.604 --> 02:04:50.185]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.

[02:05:00.922 --> 02:05:04.785]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[02:05:04.785 --> 02:05:10.308]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:05:10.308 --> 02:05:18.033]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:05:18.033 --> 02:05:27.119]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:05:27.339 --> 02:05:34.506]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:05:34.506 --> 02:05:37.408]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:05:37.408 --> 02:05:43.334]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[02:05:44.034 --> 02:05:44.615]  War.
[02:05:44.615 --> 02:05:45.856]  Oh, there's another one!
[02:05:45.856 --> 02:05:47.198]  Another plane just hit!
[02:05:47.198 --> 02:05:48.279]  State of Mind.
[02:05:48.279 --> 02:05:49.841]  Because there's a war on.

[02:06:01.107 --> 02:06:06.631]  The world is discovering the power of medicinal silver to fight against life-threatening pathogens.
[02:06:06.631 --> 02:06:10.453]  And as a result, dozens of silver solutions have emerged.
[02:06:10.453 --> 02:06:13.855]  You can even make your own colloidal silver at home in your garage.
[02:06:13.855 --> 02:06:17.317]  How do you know which solution is the safest and most effective?
[02:06:17.317 --> 02:06:23.941]  Supernatural Silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current.
[02:06:23.941 --> 02:06:27.364]  This technology is so powerful, it must be made in a laboratory.
[02:06:28.024 --> 02:06:39.412]  Colloidal and ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current, making supernatural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses, bacteria, and fungus.
[02:06:39.412 --> 02:06:44.375]  Supernatural silver liquid can be used internally, and our silver gel can be used topically.

[02:08:17.691 --> 02:08:26.475]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:26.475 --> 02:08:37.621]  The wife of Ibram Todushev, who was executed by an FBI death squad, well, tied to a chair.
[02:08:37.621 --> 02:08:40.182]  They declared national security on it.
[02:08:40.182 --> 02:08:41.423]  I guess they'll come to my house and do that to me.
[02:08:41.423 --> 02:08:42.884]  They'll be like, well, that's what we do.
[02:08:42.884 --> 02:08:44.445]  That's the free, I'm the brave.
[02:08:44.445 --> 02:08:47.046]  I mean, if we can't secretly execute people, what can't we do, you know?
[02:08:48.507 --> 02:08:48.827]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:08:48.827 --> 02:08:51.229]  We've noticed you haven't been taking your full ride, so if you could just
[02:09:13.055 --> 02:09:17.516]  Come in and we'll give you your fluoride and maybe a little mercury, okay?
[02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.676]  Is that okay with you?
[02:09:18.676 --> 02:09:19.737]  Can we tie you down?
[02:09:19.737 --> 02:09:27.718]  You sound like the Fox Brothers that do Conrad the Constitution pieces where this turd walks up to his front door and he goes, oh, you're a turd.
[02:09:27.718 --> 02:09:30.279]  And he goes, I'm not a turd.
[02:09:30.279 --> 02:09:33.300]  I'm the Affordable Care Act.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.700]  And then Pelosi's like a dog and does something on the front lawn.
[02:09:35.700 --> 02:09:36.400]  He goes, what's that?
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:38.721]  And he goes, oh, that's the employer mandate.
[02:09:40.063 --> 02:09:44.805]  I'm going to leave that there until after the election.
[02:09:44.805 --> 02:09:45.925]  It's so funny.
[02:09:45.925 --> 02:09:47.205]  I'm a big fan of the Fox Brothers.
[02:09:47.205 --> 02:09:48.746]  Go ahead, sorry.
[02:09:48.746 --> 02:09:50.567]  Oh man, well, just typical NPR.
[02:09:50.567 --> 02:09:53.908]  Hey, first of all, I just wanted to say... Hey, what's wrong with bombing people?
[02:09:53.908 --> 02:09:55.088]  It's pre-liberal.
[02:09:55.088 --> 02:09:57.109]  Hey, why don't you like Mercury?
[02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:58.249]  It's good for you.
[02:09:58.249 --> 02:10:00.110]  Guy just taking a ride.
[02:10:01.148 --> 02:10:12.477]  Well, first, before I get to my point, I just wanted to say thank you to you and your staff and whoever your source is down in Texas for leaking that information about the nuclear transfer.
[02:10:12.477 --> 02:10:13.558]  I don't think people understand.
[02:10:13.558 --> 02:10:16.720]  I mean, that literally might have saved millions of American lives.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:18.922]  That could have been their false flag for all we know.
[02:10:18.922 --> 02:10:21.604]  So, you guys are true patriots for doing that.
[02:10:21.604 --> 02:10:25.807]  As we know, since you study history at SUI, you know, history repeats itself.
[02:10:27.129 --> 02:10:35.576]  And one thing we've noticed about all these false flag terror events in our country is that there seems to be, and you actually talked about this earlier on the broadcast, there's always a drill taking place.
[02:10:35.576 --> 02:10:37.418]  So I haven't heard you talk about this.
[02:10:37.418 --> 02:10:44.944]  Are you aware of the drill that the government is planning November 13th and 14th to shut down the entire power grid for two days and see what the response would be?
[02:10:46.064 --> 02:10:48.285]  Yes, and I've told my crew to talk more about it.
[02:10:48.285 --> 02:11:02.788]  I think they're going to selectively do it in FEMA Region 3, but then we've learned there's other drills, and they're doing basically a martial law federalization takeover drill with the Army, riot police, you name it, all over the East Coast.
[02:11:02.788 --> 02:11:11.030]  And also in West Virginia, they've taken over for like six months schools, roads, for the Boy Scout National Event, but it's like a martial law drill.
[02:11:12.168 --> 02:11:12.789]  That's what it is.
[02:11:12.789 --> 02:11:17.253]  It's all acclimation to get the troops ready for this.
[02:11:17.253 --> 02:11:18.474]  And yes, it's a big deal.
[02:11:18.474 --> 02:11:24.439]  People can type in the North American governments to run massive cyber attack drill in November.
[02:11:24.439 --> 02:11:27.722]  And they've also got one coming up in October.
[02:11:27.722 --> 02:11:28.823]  There's a whole bunch of drills.
[02:11:28.823 --> 02:11:33.227]  It's Grid X2 Grid SecCon update.
[02:11:33.227 --> 02:11:35.049]  And it's on InfoWars.com.
[02:11:35.049 --> 02:11:36.029]  Drills are notable.
[02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:39.271]  Because they're the perfect cover for false flag ops.
[02:11:39.271 --> 02:11:46.054]  But more than that, it's a drill for total federalization, so that NORTHCOM can practice how to selectively shut off the power grids and get them back on.
[02:11:46.054 --> 02:11:50.096]  Because their big dream, and they've said this, is to be able to shut your power off, but then get it back up.
[02:11:50.096 --> 02:11:51.597]  That's the big problem.
[02:11:51.597 --> 02:11:52.457]  You think it'd be easy?
[02:11:52.457 --> 02:11:55.799]  It takes decades of skill and things just to keep them up.
[02:11:55.799 --> 02:11:56.819]  It's an art.
[02:11:56.819 --> 02:11:58.540]  It's a science.
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:11:59.140]  It's amazing.
[02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:00.401]  Most countries can't do it.
[02:12:01.182 --> 02:12:05.677]  America and Switzerland and people and the French and others were real good at it.
[02:12:05.677 --> 02:12:06.901]  Taught the world how to do it.
[02:12:07.622 --> 02:12:11.183]  And that's why most third world countries have plenty of power, they just don't know how to run it.
[02:12:11.183 --> 02:12:12.564]  Because it's hard.
[02:12:12.564 --> 02:12:14.364]  And they used to do it with pads of paper.
[02:12:14.364 --> 02:12:16.285]  Like the 40s and 50s and 60s and stuff.
[02:12:16.285 --> 02:12:18.306]  I mean, it's genius level stuff.
[02:12:18.306 --> 02:12:21.787]  And it's an art form passed down by these people.
[02:12:21.787 --> 02:12:26.809]  And the power companies keep saying, we're trying to keep the power up, but they keep shutting them all down.
[02:12:26.809 --> 02:12:35.512]  And so, this is mainly a drill, testing martial law, and testing locals going under federal control, and how to turn our power off.
[02:12:35.512 --> 02:12:35.772]  Go ahead.
[02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:41.657]  Well, you've been asking your callers to come in and say, what do you think the Empire Strikes Back would be?
[02:12:41.657 --> 02:12:43.439]  For some reason, I connected those jocks.
[02:12:43.439 --> 02:12:45.121]  It, like, sent chill through my body.
[02:12:45.121 --> 02:12:47.765]  Just something surreal about that whole thing.
[02:12:47.765 --> 02:12:51.249]  And these people, these kleptocratic psychopaths,
[02:12:51.770 --> 02:12:55.572]  Yeah, I do, and I'm really freaked out because I've talked to so many high-powered people
[02:13:20.787 --> 02:13:25.451]  Uh, that the establishment really is watching our show.
[02:13:25.451 --> 02:13:27.713]  And I'm aware, I already know that, but it's like creepy.
[02:13:27.713 --> 02:13:29.714]  I mean, it's just hope folks pray for us.
[02:13:29.714 --> 02:13:31.556]  I mean, this is the opposite of an ego trip.
[02:13:31.556 --> 02:13:36.640]  I'm up there going, wow, we're kind of like in Mordor with the ring trying to climb up the side of Mount Doom here.
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:41.043]  So we need everybody's help and support and spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:13:41.043 --> 02:13:43.766]  And we need financial support because I'm maxed out trying to complete.
[02:13:44.446 --> 02:13:55.614]  All these operations, and I know I should focus mainly on my radio show, and I am, but I also kind of instinctively want to build up a larger infrastructure that understands this info, so no matter what happens to me, I can go forward.
[02:13:55.614 --> 02:13:56.615]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:13:56.615 --> 02:13:58.336]  God bless you, Owen.
[02:13:58.336 --> 02:14:04.440]  I tell you, these are the times that really are exciting in a frightening way, but also an exhilarating way.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.942]  No one should be bored right now.
[02:14:05.942 --> 02:14:07.523]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:14:07.523 --> 02:14:12.907]  You're bored if you're focused on NFL and acting cool and, you know, your wife's focused on
[02:14:14.403 --> 02:14:15.163]  I don't know what.
[02:14:15.163 --> 02:14:19.985]  I mean, we should be focused on trying to survive as a civilization and move forward.
[02:14:19.985 --> 02:14:22.305]  President Bush, thank you for holding.
[02:14:22.305 --> 02:14:23.626]  That's what you say your name is.
[02:14:23.626 --> 02:14:25.666]  I'd be a conspiracy theorist if I questioned that.
[02:14:25.666 --> 02:14:28.807]  You're supposed to mindlessly believe whatever you're told, or you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:14:28.807 --> 02:14:31.628]  So I believe you are George Bush.
[02:14:31.628 --> 02:14:34.189]  In fact, especially if Rachel Maddow told me so.
[02:14:34.189 --> 02:14:35.209]  Go ahead, President.
[02:14:36.394 --> 02:14:38.115]  Well, howdy there, Alex.
[02:14:38.115 --> 02:14:43.620]  I'm over here at my fellow bonesman and cousin's house, John Kerry, here in Boston, Massachusetts.
[02:14:43.620 --> 02:14:45.802]  And we are, you know what we like to do.
[02:14:45.802 --> 02:14:50.726]  We like to, well... Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:50.726 --> 02:14:56.151]  Yeah, we just got done sacrificing a goat to help get this war in Syria started.
[02:14:56.151 --> 02:14:58.693]  And of course, when you say that... I can't really do a good George Bush.
[02:14:58.693 --> 02:15:02.276]  Of course, when you say that, kid, kid has a double meaning.
[02:15:02.276 --> 02:15:04.478]  Did you kill a four-legged kid or a two-legged kid?
[02:15:05.751 --> 02:15:12.936]  Well, there's an old saying in Massachusetts, if you fool me once, shame on you.
[02:15:12.936 --> 02:15:15.017]  Fool me twice, you can't get fooled again.
[02:15:15.017 --> 02:15:26.444]  So, we're really concerned over here and we're just trying to do what we can to get this war started.
[02:15:26.444 --> 02:15:31.908]  John Kerry, he's doing the best he can, but Obama, he just doesn't seem to have it in him.
[02:15:32.378 --> 02:15:37.240]  John Kerry is liberal, so anything he does is alright.
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:39.961]  How dare you talk bad about him?
[02:15:39.961 --> 02:15:42.322]  What's the big deal about him in the FBI?
[02:15:42.322 --> 02:15:43.642]  What's the big deal about him in the FBI?
[02:15:43.642 --> 02:15:46.724]  That's not my cousin we're talking about here.
[02:15:46.724 --> 02:15:56.727]  You're right, George W. Bush is cousins with John Kerry and with Obama, and with Dick Cheney, and they do stand in a giant vat of feces.
[02:15:56.727 --> 02:16:00.109]  I'm not going to say it on air, we have children listening, but it's very trendy.
[02:16:02.051 --> 02:16:02.912]  I mean, you know, L.A.
[02:16:02.912 --> 02:16:04.213]  thinks they just invented all this.
[02:16:04.213 --> 02:16:07.556]  I mean, no, the Germanic death cults had it figured out a while ago.
[02:16:07.556 --> 02:16:12.560]  Because if you'll do this when you're, you know, 20 years old, you'll do anything we tell you.
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.183]  Okay, now you've bathed in this.
[02:16:15.183 --> 02:16:18.606]  Now you will be willing to start doing really hardcore stuff.
[02:16:18.606 --> 02:16:19.667]  It's kind of a gang initiation.
[02:16:19.667 --> 02:16:21.909]  Thank you for the call, extremist.
[02:16:21.909 --> 02:16:25.552]  Let's go ahead and talk to Christian in Nevada.
[02:16:25.552 --> 02:16:26.253]  Go ahead, Christian.
[02:16:27.894 --> 02:16:28.435]  Hey Alex!
[02:16:28.435 --> 02:16:29.996]  It's actually Kristen.
[02:16:29.996 --> 02:16:30.856]  How are you?
[02:16:30.856 --> 02:16:31.537]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:31.537 --> 02:16:33.118]  My eyes must be getting bad.
[02:16:33.118 --> 02:16:34.099]  It's across the room.
[02:16:34.099 --> 02:16:35.140]  It is Kristen.
[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:36.961]  I apologize, Kristen.
[02:16:36.961 --> 02:16:40.704]  That's okay.
[02:16:40.704 --> 02:16:44.947]  So today I was catching up on your show from yesterday and you had talked about
[02:16:46.670 --> 02:16:59.721]  Uh, the story about the hooker and, like, she got all beaten up and hit by a car or whatever it was and you're basically, like, saying how, um, basically America wants to, like, keep people down and dependent on them.
[02:16:59.721 --> 02:17:03.544]  Well, the criminals that run America do, they want to break our will.
[02:17:03.544 --> 02:17:05.626]  Everything they do is about training us.
[02:17:05.626 --> 02:17:06.547]  We have no dignity.
[02:17:06.547 --> 02:17:07.788]  We have no rights.
[02:17:07.788 --> 02:17:09.850]  Yes, they're running pimp game on us.
[02:17:11.033 --> 02:17:18.998]  Yeah, and, um, unfortunately I was brainwashed to be like a liberal for, you know, growing up.
[02:17:18.998 --> 02:17:20.639]  Oh, good.
[02:17:20.639 --> 02:17:21.279]  Yeah.
[02:17:21.279 --> 02:17:23.841]  So, um, but I'm a single parent.
[02:17:23.841 --> 02:17:33.667]  I work two jobs and my parents, I call them libtards, but they're always like trying to get me to get on sex and aid and get on bootstamps and all this.
[02:17:33.667 --> 02:17:38.830]  And I don't because they make it pretty much impossible for you to not do that by yourself.
[02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:39.271]  And, um,
[02:17:40.211 --> 02:17:46.654]  I would suggest going to church and finding a good, hard-working man who wants a good woman and wants to help take care of her kid.
[02:17:46.654 --> 02:17:50.955]  There are a lot of good men out there who actually want to take care of a woman who already has children.
[02:17:50.955 --> 02:17:54.056]  I mean, you could probably go find a good, loving man.
[02:17:54.056 --> 02:17:55.377]  There are some left in this country.
[02:17:56.715 --> 02:18:09.998]  I think they're in Las Vegas, but I actually, I just got my daughter into Catholic school, which is, you know, another whole thing in itself, but it was a huge fight because I don't get her vaccinated, and it was like another huge deal with that.
[02:18:09.998 --> 02:18:13.199]  But see, as more of us say no, it makes it easier.
[02:18:13.199 --> 02:18:19.461]  By law, there's the waiver, and you just show them the literature and you help them, and that's a good thing you did.
[02:18:21.129 --> 02:18:48.624]  Yeah, and I just, I admire you so much, and I started listening to you about six years ago, and you kind of just like opened my eyes, and like when I was going to college, I'm trying to get back, but it's a little hard right now, but I had done a report in my political science class about the Federal Reserve, and I based a lot of it off of In the Fed by Ron Paul, and my professor was a Democrat, and he worked on Harry Reid's campaign,
[02:18:49.504 --> 02:19:05.559]  And so I gave my report to the class and he basically tried to tell me that it was all false and like the Federal Reserve is not a private bank and like all this stuff and it's just like it's sad that you know our kids have to grow up thinking that.
[02:19:05.559 --> 02:19:07.621]  Well you're right but here's the great news Kristen.
[02:19:09.102 --> 02:19:14.603]  That doesn't work anymore when they say, oh, the Federal Reserve's not private.
[02:19:14.603 --> 02:19:16.784]  Oh, there's no mercury in the shot.
[02:19:16.784 --> 02:19:18.924]  Oh, there's no... It doesn't work anymore.
[02:19:18.924 --> 02:19:25.185]  So don't feel bad when they strike back against you with what they've been told makes them part of the winning team.
[02:19:25.185 --> 02:19:27.406]  They're part of the losing team.
[02:19:27.406 --> 02:19:30.147]  They're part of the ignorant follower team.
[02:19:30.147 --> 02:19:36.568]  And even though you're struggling and poor, you have honor and dignity that is so beautiful.
[02:19:37.208 --> 02:19:40.491]  And you have the seed of the universe in you, as Mahatma Gandhi said.
[02:19:40.491 --> 02:19:41.511]  And that's all that matters.
[02:19:41.511 --> 02:19:44.373]  And you're a loving mother taking care of your child.
[02:19:44.373 --> 02:19:47.036]  And you are the purest thing in this world.
[02:19:47.036 --> 02:19:48.236]  So don't ever forget that.
[02:19:48.236 --> 02:19:52.059]  You're God's greatest creation is a woman and her child.
[02:19:52.059 --> 02:19:58.104]  And you should be absolutely just feeling so good about what you're doing and these fights you're winning.
[02:19:58.104 --> 02:19:59.285]  God is going to help you more.
[02:20:01.661 --> 02:20:03.723]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:20:03.723 --> 02:20:11.292]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:20:13.972 --> 02:20:16.714]  50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[02:20:16.714 --> 02:20:18.895]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[02:20:18.895 --> 02:20:25.299]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[02:20:25.299 --> 02:20:33.523]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[02:20:33.523 --> 02:20:39.847]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[02:20:40.467 --> 02:20:41.788]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[02:22:53.681 --> 02:23:03.230]  Hi, this is Eric Hamburg with Midas Resources Gold and Silver.
[02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:07.335]  Ever wonder why billionaires like Warren Buffett, John Paulson are dumping their shares of U.S.
[02:23:07.335 --> 02:23:08.436]  company stocks?
[02:23:08.436 --> 02:23:09.717]  Do they know something we don't?
[02:23:09.717 --> 02:23:13.321]  No investor wants to own stocks with falling profit margins and shrinking dividends.
[02:23:13.641 --> 02:23:16.702]  Is it possible a 1987-style market crash is coming?
[02:23:16.702 --> 02:23:20.144]  Are these investors aware of a massive correction of up to 90%?
[02:23:20.144 --> 02:23:28.948]  Call me, Eric Hamburg, at 800-686-2237, extension 120, and find out why gold and silver are the only true safe haven.
[02:23:28.948 --> 02:23:36.231]  With event-driven risks, such as volatility in the financial market and conflict in Syria and the Middle East, the sky's the limit for gold and silver.
[02:23:36.231 --> 02:23:37.052]  That's Eric Hamburg, 800.
[02:23:38.312 --> 02:23:46.680]  And I'll send you a brochure explaining why gold and silver are the only way to preserve your purchasing power.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:51.985]  As a currency's value crumbles and gold being priced in dollars, metal's value will skyrocket.
[02:23:51.985 --> 02:23:54.027]  Again, that's Eric Hamburg, Midas Resources.
[02:24:13.928 --> 02:24:20.395]  Ibram Totochev knew the Tsarnaev brothers.
[02:24:20.395 --> 02:24:27.342]  He was reportedly slight friends off and on lifting weights with Tamerlan.
[02:24:27.342 --> 02:24:35.250]  We now know that the younger surviving brother has pled not guilty and they've declared national security.
[02:24:36.599 --> 02:24:40.021]  On the case, meaning no news of what's going on in the court can come out.
[02:24:40.021 --> 02:24:41.701]  Secret courts.
[02:24:41.701 --> 02:24:47.484]  Because, we already know, his brother was working for the CIA, in a CIA program.
[02:24:47.484 --> 02:24:48.965]  This came out in mainstream news in Europe.
[02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:56.492]  As part of the program run out of Georgetown University and controlled by Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[02:24:56.492 --> 02:24:58.212]  They were clearly part of a drill and set up.
[02:24:58.212 --> 02:24:59.532]  We know that drill happened.
[02:24:59.532 --> 02:25:04.314]  They had a drill yesterday, blowing something up on a tarmac to scare the public.
[02:25:04.314 --> 02:25:07.715]  They could have said that was real and set up some guy as part of a drill.
[02:25:07.715 --> 02:25:09.575]  This is very dangerous, folks.
[02:25:09.575 --> 02:25:17.037]  And you notice the media says that Zohar and Tamerlan are the bombers, even though
[02:25:18.442 --> 02:25:23.825]  They screamed at the police, we didn't do it, don't shoot, even though it turns out they didn't kill the cops.
[02:25:23.825 --> 02:25:31.549]  And then their friend, just someone they knew a bit, the FBI came and shot him in the back of the head.
[02:25:31.549 --> 02:25:34.170]  And then got caught lying about it.
[02:25:34.170 --> 02:25:37.632]  And we have his wife, we're also later going to try to get some of his family on.
[02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:48.835]  Rene Totechev and they've got a operation they're running to try to get justice for him.
[02:25:48.835 --> 02:25:50.296]  And I'm going to tell everybody something.
[02:25:50.296 --> 02:25:57.720]  The Supreme Court is hearing about the NDAA right now and how they want to secretly disappear us, secretly kill us, secretly torture us.
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:02.623]  And they've declared national security on his autopsy and what the FBI did.
[02:26:02.623 --> 02:26:05.064]  And the FBI admitted it turned out he didn't resist them.
[02:26:05.064 --> 02:26:05.845]  He didn't hurt them.
[02:26:07.072 --> 02:26:09.254]  And it looks like an execution.
[02:26:09.254 --> 02:26:09.994]  A death squad.
[02:26:09.994 --> 02:26:16.199]  And I hate to talk like that with his widow here on the line with us.
[02:26:16.199 --> 02:26:20.241]  Mrs. Totoshev, thank you so much for having the courage to come on with us.
[02:26:20.241 --> 02:26:22.043]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:26:22.043 --> 02:26:23.584]  I'll give you the floor now.
[02:26:23.584 --> 02:26:30.408]  Tell us what happened, what's developed since then, and from any information you have, why they wanted him dead.
[02:26:30.408 --> 02:26:34.191]  Hi, how are you?
[02:26:37.899 --> 02:26:40.861]  Glad to speak with you and speak on the show.
[02:26:40.861 --> 02:26:45.243]  There's really not much stuff that we know since they haven't responded to us.
[02:26:45.243 --> 02:26:48.625]  They haven't brought their own statements or anything.
[02:26:48.625 --> 02:26:54.208]  It's just pretty much only out of the press we know some statements that they have been bringing up.
[02:26:54.208 --> 02:26:56.009]  But there is nothing much going on from them.
[02:26:56.009 --> 02:26:57.629]  They're not responding to us.
[02:26:57.629 --> 02:26:58.450]  They're not talking to us.
[02:26:58.450 --> 02:27:00.231]  They do not want to bring anything up.
[02:27:01.195 --> 02:27:03.717]  And so now lawsuits are being filed.
[02:27:03.717 --> 02:27:14.146]  I mean, tell us about the move to get justice for your executed husband.
[02:27:14.146 --> 02:27:15.408]  Yes, Skype dropped.
[02:27:15.408 --> 02:27:16.669]  It was working great until we went to her.
[02:27:16.669 --> 02:27:19.411]  You haven't given us the autopsy report.
[02:27:19.411 --> 02:27:21.373]  Once again, we can't do much stuff without us.
[02:27:22.463 --> 02:27:32.907]  Yes, so we don't really have so many official papers of what really happened in there, so there's not much we can do before we do our independent investigation, which is what we are doing right now.
[02:27:32.907 --> 02:27:42.291]  And there's a lot of prosecutors from Florida who want to investigate the case, and those people are helping us to get justice for him.
[02:27:42.291 --> 02:27:45.152]  How do people find out more about justice for your husband?
[02:27:45.152 --> 02:27:48.133]  Because, again, if they can execute him, they can execute anybody.
[02:27:49.756 --> 02:27:50.716]  I'm sure they can.
[02:27:50.716 --> 02:27:56.018]  And that's what we're trying to get to people, that he was killed unfairly.
[02:27:56.018 --> 02:28:00.619]  It was just, they came to our home and they just shot him there.
[02:28:00.619 --> 02:28:03.340]  And that's what we're trying to get to people, that this is wrong.
[02:28:03.340 --> 02:28:05.141]  This cannot be happening anymore.
[02:28:05.141 --> 02:28:12.823]  And there's, we just, I don't even know how we're going to get the justice, but we're going to fight for it.
[02:28:12.823 --> 02:28:14.143]  It's going to be a hard case.
[02:28:14.143 --> 02:28:15.464]  We're going to be fighting with the FBI.
[02:28:17.878 --> 02:28:23.220]  People can follow it at Twitter, if they need to and want to, it's very important.
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:28.321]  Or on Facebook, it's at Russian underscore Miami 1.
[02:28:28.321 --> 02:28:33.883]  And also, tell us the best place to visit on Facebook.
[02:28:33.883 --> 02:28:41.946]  We, I don't know that the Russian Facebook, what were you exactly talking about, but we do have our page for the Ibrahim Justice.
[02:28:41.946 --> 02:28:44.246]  Sure, sure, tell us, because there's quite a few of them.
[02:28:44.246 --> 02:28:45.707]  Which one's the best one for people to go to?
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:49.701]  Justice for Ibrahim Tadashev.
[02:28:49.701 --> 02:28:51.062]  That's the main one.
[02:28:51.062 --> 02:28:53.343]  That's what we have and that's where I am on.
[02:28:53.343 --> 02:28:54.803]  And that's the one we've got on screen.
[02:28:54.803 --> 02:28:58.545]  Justice for Ibrahim Tadashev, correct?
[02:28:59.278 --> 02:29:00.099]  Correct.
[02:29:00.099 --> 02:29:00.799]  That's right.
[02:29:00.799 --> 02:29:01.220]  All right.
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:03.321]  Now, this is a short segment.
[02:29:03.321 --> 02:29:04.102]  We're coming back in a moment.
[02:29:04.102 --> 02:29:09.687]  But I want to get specifically into, for those that haven't followed this, they first said he attacked them.
[02:29:09.687 --> 02:29:10.568]  They were injured.
[02:29:10.568 --> 02:29:12.129]  Then they admitted they weren't hurt.
[02:29:12.129 --> 02:29:14.511]  Then it was he was in a chair and they shot him in the back of the head.
[02:29:14.511 --> 02:29:16.973]  And they're not going to discuss it.
[02:29:16.973 --> 02:29:22.097]  From what I know about their tactics, and they have hit teams in the FBI, he was scared.
[02:29:22.097 --> 02:29:23.639]  He said, they're coming to kill me.
[02:29:23.639 --> 02:29:24.580]  I want to talk about
[02:29:25.777 --> 02:29:40.402]  As best you know from what was first reported and the different stories the FBI told and why you think and what the family thinks about what his relationship really was with the brothers, the CIA patsies.
[02:29:40.402 --> 02:29:41.362]  We'll be right back, ma'am.
[02:29:41.362 --> 02:29:50.225]  We'll come right back to you with this very important, obviously, breaking news report here to get justice for this executed man.
[02:29:50.225 --> 02:29:51.625]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.625 --> 02:29:53.126]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.142 --> 02:30:02.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.386 --> 02:30:05.387]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:30:05.387 --> 02:30:11.770]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:30:11.770 --> 02:30:18.153]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[02:30:18.553 --> 02:30:20.855]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[02:30:20.855 --> 02:30:22.196]  They're the good guys.
[02:30:22.196 --> 02:30:25.258]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[02:30:25.258 --> 02:30:29.781]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer, and it's revolutionary.
[02:30:29.781 --> 02:30:33.323]  You'll get 24-hour protection for just $14.99 a month.
[02:30:33.323 --> 02:30:36.245]  There are no hidden fees and no contracts.
[02:30:36.245 --> 02:30:37.466]  You'll save thousands.
[02:30:37.466 --> 02:30:40.868]  Plus, you're protected by their 100% money-back guarantee.
[02:30:40.868 --> 02:30:44.290]  Protect yourself against home invasions and break-ins.
[02:30:44.290 --> 02:30:48.233]  Order your SimpliSafe system now and receive a wireless keychain remote.
[02:30:48.493 --> 02:30:50.835]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[02:30:50.835 --> 02:30:57.139]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[02:30:57.139 --> 02:30:58.340]  Hundreds of you help
[02:31:14.667 --> 02:31:14.947]  We're good.
[02:31:44.707 --> 02:31:45.548]  We're good to go.
[02:32:01.866 --> 02:32:15.617]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[02:32:15.617 --> 02:32:25.925]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless pure nano-silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.
[02:32:26.565 --> 02:32:31.229]  Your self-produced nano-silver solutions can be applied topically to the skin.
[02:32:31.229 --> 02:32:41.176]  For many who are new to silver, that wish to try silver for the first time, we offer a full line of consumables and cosmetics, such as our 2-ounce nano-silver nasal sprays.
[02:32:41.616 --> 02:32:42.277]  We're good to go.
[02:33:19.395 --> 02:33:23.477]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:23.477 --> 02:33:35.203]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.203 --> 02:33:42.767]  Rene Totechev and her husband executed.
[02:33:42.767 --> 02:33:45.988]  He was told that the FBI wanted to come talk to him.
[02:33:45.988 --> 02:33:48.170]  He said they're coming to kill me, the press reported.
[02:33:49.246 --> 02:33:50.967]  And then suddenly he was dead.
[02:33:50.967 --> 02:33:55.729]  Killed execution style.
[02:33:55.729 --> 02:33:57.989]  In May 22nd of 2013.
[02:33:57.989 --> 02:34:05.152]  They arrived at his apartment in Orlando, Florida.
[02:34:05.152 --> 02:34:08.673]  Interviewed him for 8 hours in the living room.
[02:34:08.673 --> 02:34:09.374]  That's... that's...
[02:34:10.802 --> 02:34:15.903]  Let me tell you what that is, and I hate to talk about this because this nice lady says she doesn't know what happened.
[02:34:15.903 --> 02:34:17.984]  I know the standard procedure.
[02:34:17.984 --> 02:34:22.885]  You know what eight hours means, right?
[02:34:22.885 --> 02:34:27.106]  They got the info they wanted and they executed him.
[02:34:27.106 --> 02:34:36.788]  My opinion from past operations studying these people is this has the hallmarks of someone tortured and then executed.
[02:34:36.788 --> 02:34:38.068]  They would have kept torturing him.
[02:34:40.310 --> 02:34:41.251]  And then executed him.
[02:34:41.251 --> 02:34:42.651]  Terence Yakey was tortured.
[02:34:42.651 --> 02:34:44.773]  It appeared for more than five hours.
[02:34:44.773 --> 02:34:45.753]  May the police have interviewed him.
[02:34:45.753 --> 02:34:49.095]  He was tortured all over his body before they shot him in the back of the head.
[02:34:49.095 --> 02:34:51.317]  Same execution style.
[02:34:51.317 --> 02:34:54.559]  He, of course, knew who the feds were that bombed Oklahoma City.
[02:34:54.559 --> 02:34:55.219]  False flags.
[02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:56.920]  They do not play games, folks.
[02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:01.383]  And undoubtedly, it did leak that Tamerlan was
[02:35:02.918 --> 02:35:09.021]  Working in a CIA program to radicalize Mujahideen to attack Russia.
[02:35:09.021 --> 02:35:10.902]  He was part of a program that's been connected to that.
[02:35:10.902 --> 02:35:12.582]  That came out in the mainstream news.
[02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:13.363]  It's not in the US.
[02:35:15.623 --> 02:35:16.324]  You can look that up.
[02:35:16.324 --> 02:35:20.748]  We wrote about articles pointing to the German and French and Russian news about it.
[02:35:20.748 --> 02:35:25.832]  That's why the Russians had blown his cover, his fake name, and said, who is this guy you allowed to fly in and out with a fake name?
[02:35:25.832 --> 02:35:26.673]  He works for you, doesn't he?
[02:35:26.673 --> 02:35:27.374]  And they're like, oh!
[02:35:27.374 --> 02:35:30.236]  And then the FBI lied so that they didn't know him.
[02:35:30.236 --> 02:35:33.119]  These guys were playboys out partying.
[02:35:33.119 --> 02:35:34.560]  Clearly weren't even Muslims.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:37.283]  Just like Muhammad Atta at the Topless Bars every night.
[02:35:37.283 --> 02:35:38.124]  They had a lot of money.
[02:35:40.027 --> 02:35:47.936]  And her husband reportedly lifted weights with him, and they seem to believe that he had been given the intel of their real identities.
[02:35:47.936 --> 02:35:49.958]  Well, we already know those are blown.
[02:35:49.958 --> 02:35:51.961]  The older brother was definitely CIA asset.
[02:35:54.266 --> 02:35:55.127]  And got set up.
[02:35:55.127 --> 02:36:00.211]  People that are being recruited to this need to understand, especially Muslims, they've done this a lot where they set you up.
[02:36:00.211 --> 02:36:00.811]  So look out.
[02:36:00.811 --> 02:36:03.934]  7-7 was the same deal in London.
[02:36:03.934 --> 02:36:05.515]  We proved those guys were patsies.
[02:36:05.515 --> 02:36:06.276]  It was part of a drill.
[02:36:06.276 --> 02:36:08.258]  They put real bombs on them and blew it up.
[02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:09.519]  Some of them escaped, figured it out.
[02:36:09.519 --> 02:36:11.600]  They machine gunned them in the street, declared national security.
[02:36:12.758 --> 02:36:13.399]  Canary Wharf.
[02:36:13.399 --> 02:36:14.761]  I'm going to be quiet now.
[02:36:14.761 --> 02:36:18.004]  It's so hard to give out this info while I know that Renny Toteshev, his widow, is here.
[02:36:18.004 --> 02:36:20.166]  We're going to talk about justice for your husband.
[02:36:20.166 --> 02:36:23.630]  You heard me just lay out what the circumstances point at.
[02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:25.071]  It's pretty much cut and dry.
[02:36:25.071 --> 02:36:26.333]  From my research.
[02:36:26.333 --> 02:36:28.175]  From what I know of how these operations work.
[02:36:28.175 --> 02:36:29.776]  I'm not saying these men did this.
[02:36:29.776 --> 02:36:30.557]  That's what it points at.
[02:36:30.557 --> 02:36:31.839]  We know they shot him in the back of the head.
[02:36:33.164 --> 02:36:40.087]  Tell us what the family thinks and how well your husband really knew them, because they want a media blackout on this.
[02:36:40.087 --> 02:36:44.228]  Because all these facts for investigators out there and myself and others need this.
[02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:47.510]  The prosecutor that's looking into this in Florida, what is he asking you?
[02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:49.771]  He'll have important questions on his trail.
[02:36:49.771 --> 02:36:52.272]  So just, even though info may not mean anything to you, ma'am...
[02:36:53.132 --> 02:36:54.234]  You heard what I just said.
[02:36:54.234 --> 02:36:57.779]  It was reported he said they're coming to get me, they're gonna kill me.
[02:36:57.779 --> 02:37:01.424]  And people said, oh you'll be fine, just get out of the house, you know, just wait for them.
[02:37:01.424 --> 02:37:03.426]  Was that accurate in the media?
[02:37:03.426 --> 02:37:04.708]  Where were you when this happened?
[02:37:04.708 --> 02:37:05.589]  Tell us the whole story.
[02:37:10.902 --> 02:37:13.264]  That night I was actually in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:37:13.264 --> 02:37:16.227]  I was about seven hours away from there.
[02:37:16.227 --> 02:37:18.388]  I was at work when it happened.
[02:37:18.388 --> 02:37:21.250]  And this is not what exactly he said.
[02:37:21.250 --> 02:37:23.792]  He felt strange about it.
[02:37:23.792 --> 02:37:26.655]  This is not the first interview that was coming over.
[02:37:26.655 --> 02:37:30.017]  And they called him, they told him that it's going to be his last interview.
[02:37:30.017 --> 02:37:32.239]  The agents from Boston, they come in to speak with him.
[02:37:32.239 --> 02:37:35.121]  And he said, you guys, I'm just tired of coming to your office.
[02:37:35.121 --> 02:37:37.683]  If you want to speak with me, you can come to my house.
[02:37:37.683 --> 02:37:40.225]  And he said that if anything happens to me, just say
[02:37:40.465 --> 02:37:40.766]  I think so.
[02:37:56.698 --> 02:37:58.699]  They have interviewed him.
[02:37:58.699 --> 02:38:00.920]  He would not respond to his cell phone or anything.
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:07.684]  And they have his friend waiting for him outside, but suddenly they let him go after four hours.
[02:38:07.684 --> 02:38:11.866]  And some of the agents were still with Ibrahim.
[02:38:11.866 --> 02:38:22.191]  And right now they've been pulling so many statements that he was armed and he was unarmed and that his body was a weapon since he's an MMA fighter.
[02:38:22.971 --> 02:38:31.224]  But he just had his knee surgery back in March, so he wasn't able to move pretty quick, pretty fast or do anything.
[02:38:31.224 --> 02:38:37.314]  And after we actually, after all that happened, when we were able to enter the house,
[02:38:38.666 --> 02:38:40.307]  He had seven shots.
[02:38:40.307 --> 02:38:42.329]  One was in the back of the head.
[02:38:42.329 --> 02:38:47.432]  And it has nothing to do with him start attacking them as they said.
[02:38:47.432 --> 02:38:52.596]  They come in with the knife, with the blade, with the broom, with the swords.
[02:38:52.596 --> 02:38:55.558]  I think they came with the five different statements.
[02:38:56.717 --> 02:38:59.019]  Yeah, for those who don't know, it's important you say that.
[02:38:59.019 --> 02:39:02.881]  They've now admitted that he didn't have a weapon, didn't attack him.
[02:39:02.881 --> 02:39:06.184]  At first, we've been showing the headlines while you've been speaking.
[02:39:06.184 --> 02:39:08.025]  That's why they've had, what, five different stories.
[02:39:08.025 --> 02:39:10.307]  So now, they just declare national security.
[02:39:10.307 --> 02:39:13.048]  Keep going through it.
[02:39:13.048 --> 02:39:16.110]  So yeah, he was shot on the floor.
[02:39:16.110 --> 02:39:19.553]  He got, there's no shots in the walls or anything.
[02:39:19.553 --> 02:39:21.034]  The bullet did not touch the wall.
[02:39:25.415 --> 02:39:29.117]  Ma'am, your Skype's breaking up.
[02:39:29.117 --> 02:39:31.138]  Please, just hold a minute.
[02:39:31.138 --> 02:39:34.759]  Ma'am, let me stop you.
[02:39:34.759 --> 02:39:39.321]  Start over with him on the floor being, and this is admitted, killed execution style.
[02:39:39.321 --> 02:39:41.822]  It was done with precision.
[02:39:41.822 --> 02:39:43.483]  Seven shots.
[02:39:43.483 --> 02:39:46.264]  Go through that again so your testimony's on record.
[02:39:46.264 --> 02:39:47.305]  Your Skype broke up.
[02:39:48.479 --> 02:39:53.801]  Um, so he was definitely on the floor because there is no blood spurting on the wall.
[02:39:53.801 --> 02:39:56.561]  Um, there is no bullets on the wall.
[02:39:56.561 --> 02:40:12.006]  And, um, he got seven shots, but he does have about 11 holes in his body, which means some of the bullets went through, and which means those bullets has to be somewhere in the wall if he was standing up, if they were trying to say that he was attacking them.
[02:40:12.896 --> 02:40:17.480]  But none of the bullets was anywhere but the floor.
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:23.184]  Most likely his face was down and he was shot near the entrance of the door.
[02:40:23.184 --> 02:40:26.907]  I can only guess of what was happening.
[02:40:26.907 --> 02:40:33.793]  Either he was trying to get away from them or to run away or anything could happen in there.
[02:40:34.453 --> 02:40:39.716]  And it's been almost four months they've not given us anything, any statements or anything.
[02:40:39.716 --> 02:40:45.519]  They blocked the autopsy report and this is so weird to me and it should be questioned by people.
[02:40:45.519 --> 02:40:59.087]  How come with the bombing situation after three days they have to choose those people, they choose Jahar and Tamerlan and say that they were the bomber, but it's not enough for them four months to give us results, to give us
[02:41:03.751 --> 02:41:23.090]  It's so many things that they did wrong either it's just a cheap show from them they were trying to make a blow a show out of it but I don't think they think that too deep for it to make a correct things so the people will not question
[02:41:24.335 --> 02:41:25.076]  Sure.
[02:41:25.076 --> 02:41:26.477]  Your Skype broke up again.
[02:41:26.477 --> 02:41:28.638]  What about the Czarnev brothers themselves?
[02:41:28.638 --> 02:41:30.019]  Did you know them?
[02:41:30.019 --> 02:41:37.165]  Did you ever see anything that they had to say about what they were doing when they would visit the caucuses?
[02:41:37.165 --> 02:41:39.867]  Why Tamerlan had multiple names?
[02:41:39.867 --> 02:41:41.928]  Did they ever brag, hey we're secret agents?
[02:41:41.928 --> 02:41:42.749]  Was there anything like that?
[02:41:44.082 --> 02:41:45.502]  I never heard that.
[02:41:45.502 --> 02:41:49.724]  I have heard before about Tamerlan when Ibrahim used to live in Boston.
[02:41:49.724 --> 02:41:51.684]  But we get married in 2010.
[02:41:51.684 --> 02:41:56.846]  And in 2010 in September, Ibrahim moved from Boston to Atlanta.
[02:41:56.846 --> 02:42:00.086]  And he had not spoke with Tamerlan for so long.
[02:42:00.086 --> 02:42:05.168]  Maybe once in a couple of months he just would call him and ask him how he's doing.
[02:42:05.168 --> 02:42:07.328]  But they were never close friends or anything.
[02:42:07.328 --> 02:42:12.510]  So it's accurate that they were just often on friends lifting weights and stuff?
[02:42:14.525 --> 02:42:17.826]  Yes, they weren't attending to the same gym in Boston.
[02:42:17.826 --> 02:42:21.187]  Because they were both boxers basically, right?
[02:42:21.187 --> 02:42:21.728]  Correct.
[02:42:21.728 --> 02:42:23.248]  They're just, well, different types.
[02:42:23.248 --> 02:42:24.669]  Tamerlane was a boxer.
[02:42:24.669 --> 02:42:27.650]  My husband was an MMA fighter, which is mixed martial arts.
[02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:27.990]  Sure.
[02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:30.871]  So it's just a different type of fight.
[02:42:31.806 --> 02:42:32.046]  Sure.
[02:42:32.046 --> 02:42:34.548]  I mean, what does your gut tell you?
[02:42:34.548 --> 02:42:43.974]  What does the family think of why they were there eight hours and then he shot in the back of the head and then shot six other times on the floor?
[02:42:43.974 --> 02:42:48.417]  I mean, what do you guys think really happened in your gut?
[02:42:48.417 --> 02:42:56.122]  The only guess we can have that they, first of all, they knew that they are going there to kill him.
[02:42:56.122 --> 02:42:59.204]  And they probably have told them
[02:43:00.146 --> 02:43:04.269]  They have told Ibrahim of what they've done to Tamerlan, what they've done to Jahar.
[02:43:04.269 --> 02:43:10.152]  They probably told him that all this set up and either you're going to admit that you were there or you were helping or whatever.
[02:43:10.152 --> 02:43:18.257]  And my husband just said that I'm not going to be signing anything and I'm not going to be committing to anything that I haven't done.
[02:43:18.257 --> 02:43:23.861]  Since they were trying to probably just commit him to something to sign and he just said no.
[02:43:25.717 --> 02:43:30.059]  So sign this or your brains, your signature or your brains will be on the contract?
[02:43:30.059 --> 02:43:36.762]  I'm sorry to quote the Godfather, but... But pretty much that's probably what was going on in there.
[02:43:36.762 --> 02:43:41.044]  So that's what all the evidence points towards.
[02:43:41.044 --> 02:43:43.745]  What about the precedent?
[02:43:43.745 --> 02:43:54.030]  Everyone, Ron Paul, myself, countless others said, if we set up Homeland Security Patriot Act, have an NDAA where they say they can kill citizens whenever they want, they're going to start doing it.
[02:43:55.072 --> 02:43:58.076]  And they're now disappearing.
[02:43:58.076 --> 02:44:00.099]  Citizens, you name it.
[02:44:00.099 --> 02:44:05.566]  They've got death squads that I know killed a CIA section chief in Houston a few years ago.
[02:44:05.566 --> 02:44:08.249]  He gets out of his car, they kill him, even on chopper video.
[02:44:08.249 --> 02:44:09.631]  He had no weapon.
[02:44:09.631 --> 02:44:12.094]  I mean, people need to understand we're getting to a point now...
[02:44:13.072 --> 02:44:28.022]  Where they have special unit killers on big police forces that work for the different agencies, defense intelligence, state department security services, CIA, NSA, private corporations, Blackwater connected groups.
[02:44:28.022 --> 02:44:29.483]  I mean, I happen to know this for a fact.
[02:44:29.483 --> 02:44:32.885]  I'm not naive because I had some family that
[02:44:34.738 --> 02:44:34.838]  Yes.
[02:45:06.578 --> 02:45:09.479]  That he was told, you either sign this or that's the end of it.
[02:45:09.479 --> 02:45:11.660]  And we know that's a classic confession technique.
[02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:18.064]  The Austin police have been caught on video multiple times saying, you'll sign this confession or we're going to blow your brains out.
[02:45:18.064 --> 02:45:20.365]  That's how they got a confession on the yogurt shop murders.
[02:45:20.365 --> 02:45:23.106]  Because they wanted to cover up who really did that here in Austin.
[02:45:23.106 --> 02:45:26.248]  But I'm kind of going off into inside baseball stuff.
[02:45:26.248 --> 02:45:28.289]  Other key points people should know about, ma'am.
[02:45:30.806 --> 02:45:36.990]  Um, it looks like the law enforcement been shutting so many people and they getting away with it.
[02:45:36.990 --> 02:45:49.679]  And people speak today just don't they should talk about law enforcement who killing people who killing people with with no, it just, I don't know how to say that.
[02:45:49.679 --> 02:45:52.341]  But they get in the way with so many things.
[02:45:52.341 --> 02:45:54.582]  And in this case, we're not going to get them.
[02:45:54.582 --> 02:45:58.064]  They're not going to get away with it because we are not going to stop fighting for it.
[02:45:58.064 --> 02:45:59.786]  We are going to be keep fighting for it.
[02:45:59.786 --> 02:46:00.466]  And people need to
[02:46:00.506 --> 02:46:03.068]  We're good to go.
[02:46:17.216 --> 02:46:27.786]  Well, you know the FBI in the last two years has killed 150 plus people in questionable circumstances and the FBI has ruled no fault in every case.
[02:46:27.786 --> 02:46:30.408]  Now, does anyone believe they're 100% innocent?
[02:46:30.408 --> 02:46:32.390]  I mean, how naive?
[02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:40.457]  I heard the Austin police chief say two weeks ago on the radio that there's not one bad cop in Austin and they're all good.
[02:46:40.457 --> 02:46:42.259]  Now that is just bull-faced bull.
[02:46:43.642 --> 02:46:43.822]  True.
[02:46:43.822 --> 02:46:45.723]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:46:45.723 --> 02:46:46.244]  No, I'm...
[02:47:03.263 --> 02:47:05.264]  I'm completely agree with that.
[02:47:05.264 --> 02:47:07.926]  Those are most people who you need to be afraid of.
[02:47:07.926 --> 02:47:10.748]  Because if they're going to kill you, they're going to get away with it.
[02:47:10.748 --> 02:47:12.149]  They are just law enforcement.
[02:47:12.149 --> 02:47:13.750]  The worst case scenario is going to happen.
[02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:15.792]  They're going to get fired from their job.
[02:47:15.792 --> 02:47:21.776]  And once again, just to cover somebody who is up higher, who actually was working on that case.
[02:47:22.483 --> 02:47:26.946]  Because my husband gets killed not from those people who actually kill him.
[02:47:26.946 --> 02:47:30.109]  It has to be something higher up of them.
[02:47:30.109 --> 02:47:31.810]  And what's going to happen now?
[02:47:31.810 --> 02:47:35.713]  They're going to fire the person who killed him and that's it?
[02:47:35.713 --> 02:47:42.398]  But to shot somebody seven times and say that this was a self-defense?
[02:47:42.398 --> 02:47:44.760]  Come on people, you gotta be kidding me.
[02:47:44.760 --> 02:47:46.121]  And back in the head?
[02:47:46.121 --> 02:47:48.523]  This is just a straight execution style.
[02:47:49.224 --> 02:47:51.571]  There's no way somebody would.
[02:47:51.571 --> 02:47:54.037]  Plus, if they said that he confessed.
[02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:57.462]  He, um, I'm assuming you need a live person.
[02:47:57.462 --> 02:48:03.565]  You need to open the murder since they're assigning him to a triple murder as well.
[02:48:03.565 --> 02:48:10.348]  If he just signed a confession, he confessed that he, um, he was in that murder, he killed somebody, you need a live person.
[02:48:10.348 --> 02:48:17.091]  And to stop a person, even if he's being aggressive to you, you can shot him once, twice, but not to kill him.
[02:48:17.091 --> 02:48:21.374]  He got three shots in the heart and one in the liver, one in the head.
[02:48:21.374 --> 02:48:24.055]  So those five shots are straight death shots.
[02:48:25.655 --> 02:48:27.696]  And two more head on his arm.
[02:48:27.696 --> 02:48:31.599]  So and none of them were to stop him.
[02:48:31.599 --> 02:48:34.421]  All the shots were to kill him.
[02:48:34.421 --> 02:48:38.124]  Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise.
[02:48:38.124 --> 02:48:40.886]  This was done to execute him.
[02:48:40.886 --> 02:48:42.006]  Triple shot in the heart.
[02:48:43.038 --> 02:48:49.603]  Liver shot, head shot, absolutely trying to make sure your husband was dead.
[02:48:49.603 --> 02:49:07.757]  I don't think they would do this unless they had NSA communiques, which we know they have, and that one of the brothers, probably Tamerlan, contacted him to tell him something, or he was told something that they didn't want out there.
[02:49:07.757 --> 02:49:11.720]  Did your husband ever say anything to you about things like that?
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:12.421]  No, never.
[02:49:14.298 --> 02:49:16.600]  You're in Moscow now.
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:17.961]  Why have you gone to Moscow?
[02:49:17.961 --> 02:49:21.824]  Do you not feel safe in the former United States?
[02:49:21.824 --> 02:49:29.971]  Since I brought my husband's buddy with my father-in-law back here to bury him at home in Chechnya, I haven't went back to the United States.
[02:49:29.971 --> 02:49:33.915]  And that's exactly why I do not feel safe anymore there.
[02:49:33.915 --> 02:49:38.338]  Plus, my mom being right now, she's working for the U.S.
[02:49:38.338 --> 02:49:38.559]  Army.
[02:49:39.831 --> 02:49:42.174]  They have took her files right now.
[02:49:42.174 --> 02:49:46.198]  She's under investigation as well from the FBI.
[02:49:46.198 --> 02:49:52.104]  And for me to go back there, I think that's probably another thing they want me to do, to go back there.
[02:49:52.104 --> 02:49:53.885]  And you never know.
[02:49:53.885 --> 02:50:01.193]  Next things you know that my plane, when I was flying, get crashed, I get in a car accident or anything like that may happen as well.
[02:50:01.913 --> 02:50:03.374]  That's why I do not want to go there.
[02:50:03.374 --> 02:50:11.979]  I don't want to feel safe in there until they're going to release statements of my husband's death and tell us what happened in there.
[02:50:11.979 --> 02:50:12.600]  Wow.
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:15.602]  We're going to come back with a final segment with you.
[02:50:15.602 --> 02:50:17.102]  You have a lot of courage, obviously.
[02:50:17.102 --> 02:50:20.444]  I want to ask you when we come back, so think about this because a lot's going on.
[02:50:20.444 --> 02:50:24.147]  I've talked to some of the family, obviously.
[02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:25.868]  The aunt, and then talked to others.
[02:50:27.686 --> 02:50:31.711]  And they're ready to come on and then they get threatened away and get scared.
[02:50:31.711 --> 02:50:35.214]  I know you've talked to some of the family as well.
[02:50:35.214 --> 02:50:47.448]  When we come back I want to ask you about the parents and aunt of Tamerlan and his little brother and what they're saying to you about any threats they've received.
[02:50:47.448 --> 02:50:48.989]  It's important to get those on record.
[02:50:50.711 --> 02:50:51.771]  This is like a spy movie.
[02:50:51.771 --> 02:50:53.312]  It's very scary.
[02:50:53.312 --> 02:50:55.254]  But it's real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:55.254 --> 02:51:00.297]  And it shows what we all had to look forward to under the FEMA system.
[02:51:02.475 --> 02:51:03.055]  Whew!
[02:51:03.055 --> 02:51:03.955]  Nice shootin'!
[02:51:03.955 --> 02:51:06.636]  Hey, that's a sweet AK-47 chest rig.
[02:51:06.636 --> 02:51:07.716]  Is that multi-cam?
[02:51:07.716 --> 02:51:08.116]  Yep!
[02:51:08.116 --> 02:51:10.417]  Got it from StrikeHardGear.com.

[02:52:00.942 --> 02:52:05.665]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:52:05.665 --> 02:52:08.767]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:52:08.767 --> 02:52:14.330]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:52:14.330 --> 02:52:16.271]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:52:16.271 --> 02:52:17.912]  We are what we eat.
[02:52:17.912 --> 02:52:22.594]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:52:22.594 --> 02:52:26.817]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:52:26.817 --> 02:52:29.058]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:52:29.358 --> 02:52:35.582]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:53:01.124 --> 02:53:05.190]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:11.098]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:53:11.098 --> 02:53:12.200]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:16.245]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:53:16.886 --> 02:53:30.692]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:53:30.692 --> 02:53:36.295]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:53:36.295 --> 02:53:42.178]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:53:48.386 --> 02:53:48.446]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:14.582 --> 02:54:19.424]  We're going to talk about Zohar and Tamerlan, Tsarnaev.
[02:54:19.424 --> 02:54:24.245]  They've declared national security and gagged the trial because he says he's not guilty.
[02:54:24.245 --> 02:54:28.047]  And you know, he's in there saying, my brother was trained by them, my brother was CIA.
[02:54:28.047 --> 02:54:29.207]  We know that.
[02:54:29.207 --> 02:54:34.109]  And the mainstream controlled media, the dead media, hopes you don't find that out.
[02:54:34.109 --> 02:54:35.749]  And it's just amazing.
[02:54:35.749 --> 02:54:39.711]  We're going to go back to our guest here in just a moment, the amazing courage he has joining us from Moscow.
[02:54:39.711 --> 02:54:41.431]  I should have pointed that out to begin with.

[02:54:49.667 --> 02:54:52.208]  You're not going to hear me here promoting Bitcoin, folks, and stuff like that.
[02:54:52.208 --> 02:54:53.468]  I'm not knocking people that are into that.
[02:54:53.468 --> 02:54:55.349]  I just do not promote something speculative.
[02:54:55.349 --> 02:54:58.649]  PRIproducts.com is amazing.
[02:54:58.649 --> 02:55:00.210]  They've got it for industrial use.
[02:55:00.210 --> 02:55:02.270]  They've got it for big engines, regular engines.
[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:04.191]  This is what the real experts use.
[02:55:04.191 --> 02:55:05.311]  Engine power will increase.
[02:55:05.311 --> 02:55:07.632]  You'll get higher performance, better gas mileage.
[02:55:07.632 --> 02:55:10.393]  Your fuel will last longer, even if degraded by age.
[02:55:10.393 --> 02:55:13.374]  They've got fuel saver systems.
[02:55:13.374 --> 02:55:15.434]  It can make your fuel last for three years.
[02:55:15.434 --> 02:55:17.555]  Fuel system and engine deposits will be prevented.
[02:55:17.555 --> 02:55:18.055]  This is

[02:56:01.384 --> 02:56:04.105]  So all that more helps support the First Amendment.
[02:56:04.105 --> 02:56:05.985]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:05.985 --> 02:56:06.946]  So, talking to the families.
[02:56:13.877 --> 02:56:14.678]  I don't know.
[02:56:29.574 --> 02:56:37.521]  Ma'am, talking to their family, I know you've talked to them some, I was told, and others, have they told you why they're pretty much silent now?
[02:56:37.521 --> 02:56:43.786]  And then what do you make of the big movement for justice for the little brother that's pled not guilty right now?
[02:56:45.779 --> 02:56:48.301]  There is no, there, we don't, nobody keeps silence.
[02:56:48.301 --> 02:56:51.343]  It just, there is nothing we can do.
[02:56:51.343 --> 02:57:00.570]  Right now we just stay, the family of the Tamerlan Jahar, we're just waiting for the court date, which is going to be September 23rd, and from there see what's going to happen.
[02:57:00.570 --> 02:57:04.833]  There's, it's really, this is just a matter of time.
[02:57:04.833 --> 02:57:12.678]  We just have to be patient and wait for it, which is the hardest thing ever, that it has to, you have, you help us.
[02:57:12.678 --> 02:57:13.199]  You can do it.
[02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:15.201]  He's right there.
[02:57:15.201 --> 02:57:16.122]  We're right here.
[02:57:16.122 --> 02:57:17.504]  We can help him anyhow.
[02:57:17.504 --> 02:57:25.373]  Well, there's movements to get justice for Joe Harb, the patsy right now, pleading not guilty, trying to get access to the courts as a U.S.
[02:57:25.373 --> 02:57:27.735]  citizen, and they've not given him that.
[02:57:27.735 --> 02:57:29.758]  I mean, they're having a court trial, but it's blacked out.
[02:57:29.758 --> 02:57:32.381]  National Security, that tells everybody right there what's going on.
[02:57:32.381 --> 02:57:34.763]  Your husband's murder is now National Security, they've declared.
[02:57:35.884 --> 02:57:43.151]  And people should donate to both causes to get justice for the court system in America against the NDAA and the rest of it.
[02:57:43.151 --> 02:57:47.274]  Again, your Facebook is private.
[02:57:47.274 --> 02:57:49.736]  How do people go there to support you then?
[02:57:49.736 --> 02:57:52.258]  Or is there any other email?
[02:57:52.258 --> 02:57:54.721]  You were telling me a prosecutor wants to help you guys.
[02:57:54.721 --> 02:57:56.102]  What's some other tidbits of info?
[02:57:57.611 --> 02:58:05.942]  Now, to anyone who wants to join the group, whoever is trying to get to the group, they're just asking to be in that group.
[02:58:05.942 --> 02:58:09.167]  And we're no problem with any people in there.
[02:58:09.167 --> 02:58:10.749]  Same with the Johara group as well.
[02:58:10.749 --> 02:58:14.034]  And that's justice for Ibrahim Todeshev?
[02:58:17.135 --> 02:58:17.675]  On Facebook.
[02:58:17.675 --> 02:58:24.341]  We've been putting it up on screen so people can go there and do that.
[02:58:24.341 --> 02:58:25.141]  Or we're next.
[02:58:25.141 --> 02:58:25.982]  We could be next.
[02:58:25.982 --> 02:58:28.444]  Ma'am, thank you so much for your courage.
[02:58:28.444 --> 02:58:30.106]  And I look forward to speaking to you in the future.
[02:58:30.106 --> 02:58:38.293]  And tell the family, not just your family but the other family of the Patsy's, if they'd like to come on this show, we have the courage to put them on to defend the Republic.
[02:58:38.293 --> 02:58:39.914]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:39.914 --> 02:58:40.154]  Great.
[02:58:40.154 --> 02:58:40.995]  Thank you.
[02:58:40.995 --> 02:58:43.297]  Thank you.
[02:58:43.297 --> 02:58:44.458]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.109 --> 02:58:47.591]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:47.591 --> 02:58:49.854]  We're going into overdrive, folks.
[02:58:49.854 --> 02:58:51.195]  Stand together, hang separate.
[02:58:51.195 --> 02:58:55.080]  Are we choosing our own destiny, or has it been preselected for us?
[02:58:55.080 --> 02:59:00.607]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[02:59:00.607 --> 02:59:02.490]  Billions of dollars have been spent
[02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:08.313]  Privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[02:59:08.313 --> 02:59:17.638]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[02:59:17.638 --> 02:59:24.822]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[02:59:24.822 --> 02:59:27.644]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[02:59:27.864 --> 02:59:34.550]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[02:59:52.085 --> 02:59:55.668]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.668 --> 02:59:58.870]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.834 --> 03:00:10.680]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.680 --> 03:00:12.242]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.242 --> 03:00:14.184]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:14.184 --> 03:00:17.989]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.989 --> 03:00:22.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.516 --> 03:00:30.099]  Well, we just had the wife of a man who was executed by the FBI at his house.
[03:00:30.099 --> 03:00:36.141]  And I was reading the New York Times and Wall Street Journal today doing research to do this interview again, refreshing my memory.
[03:00:36.141 --> 03:00:39.783]  Half the time it just clouds it with all the extra factoids.
[03:00:39.783 --> 03:00:46.406]  Over 150 people in very suspicious circumstances the last two years, where the FBI's interrogating people and they just kill you.
[03:00:47.719 --> 03:00:55.284]  So, I mean, it's kind of getting to a point where if the FBI's come and interview you, you know, it's like a death penalty.
[03:00:55.284 --> 03:00:57.205]  Like, death squads.
[03:00:57.205 --> 03:01:04.490]  And I guess our government's funded death squads worldwide against anybody that resists the Federal Reserve, so why not?
[03:01:04.490 --> 03:01:05.831]  I mean, why not have death squads here?
[03:01:05.831 --> 03:01:07.592]  That's what it is.
[03:01:07.592 --> 03:01:08.533]  But I tell you, you know,
[03:01:10.526 --> 03:01:15.350]  Historically, and I don't have some macho deal where I want to see some civil war.
[03:01:15.350 --> 03:01:16.972]  That's what we're trying to avert here.
[03:01:16.972 --> 03:01:29.403]  But they'll get to a point where people that work for this corrupt federal government need to understand that people that are doing this need to be brought to justice or collectively you'll be held accountable.
[03:01:29.403 --> 03:01:35.329]  And it won't be like Oklahoma City where you guys blow up a daycare center, you know, to get everybody to feel sorry for you.
[03:01:35.329 --> 03:01:36.290]  It's not going to be like that.
[03:01:37.379 --> 03:01:48.982]  It's just going to be people will start realizing that they can't just bend over and let you shoot them in the back of the head like you did Gary Webb and so many others.
[03:01:48.982 --> 03:01:53.523]  I mean, or Terence Yeakey, cop of the year, you tortured to death and murdered.
[03:01:53.523 --> 03:01:56.384]  Called his partner minutes before he disappeared saying the feds are behind me.
[03:01:58.456 --> 03:02:00.498]  And the word is that FBI did that to him.
[03:02:00.498 --> 03:02:02.080]  And I mean, that's who they hire.
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:04.703]  I mean, that's who they get.
[03:02:04.703 --> 03:02:07.627]  Generally, former special forces types they then put into the FBI.
[03:02:07.627 --> 03:02:10.470]  It's not the lawyer types that run the FBI.
[03:02:10.470 --> 03:02:13.654]  And then they send them out, and it's a big deal.
[03:02:13.654 --> 03:02:15.937]  Take this cop, torture him, shoot him in the head, and that's what they do.
[03:02:17.008 --> 03:02:20.071]  They think they're the winning team because they can just do that and just get away with it.
[03:02:20.071 --> 03:02:20.931]  Everybody's afraid.
[03:02:20.931 --> 03:02:22.833]  Well, at a certain point, we're not afraid anymore.
[03:02:22.833 --> 03:02:23.754]  It's like, okay, whatever.
[03:02:23.754 --> 03:02:25.315]  You can only shoot me in the head once.
[03:02:25.315 --> 03:02:29.719]  You can only torture me for five hours like Terence Yeagey wants.
[03:02:29.719 --> 03:02:32.801]  After that, you're still a sack of crap.
[03:02:32.801 --> 03:02:35.343]  After that, you're still sick.
[03:02:35.343 --> 03:02:36.945]  After that, you're still who you are.
[03:02:36.945 --> 03:02:38.206]  It's not tough.
[03:02:38.206 --> 03:02:40.348]  I'm so sick of these bully-type people.
[03:02:41.325 --> 03:02:43.507]  That like, get off on scaring you.
[03:02:43.507 --> 03:02:47.010]  Get off on like, trying to make you feel small.
[03:02:47.010 --> 03:02:48.852]  I mean, you know what?
[03:02:48.852 --> 03:02:52.676]  The world is full of the bones of these empires.
[03:02:52.676 --> 03:02:53.696]  And they all fail.
[03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:57.160]  And when this one fails, and it is failing, then it's going to fail.
[03:02:59.312 --> 03:03:02.015]  Justice demands that you be dealt with.
[03:03:02.015 --> 03:03:09.321]  I don't even have any vengeance where I... I'm beyond even wanting to see these evil people suffer.
[03:03:09.321 --> 03:03:13.545]  No, I know it has to be done for justice sake.
[03:03:13.545 --> 03:03:21.352]  Because I realize how pathetic truly evil people are who get off on evil and get off on persecuting good people and innocents.
[03:03:21.352 --> 03:03:22.834]  And who get off on playing God.
[03:03:22.834 --> 03:03:24.896]  And who get off on being Judge Dredd.
[03:03:26.758 --> 03:03:30.443]  I know that you've got to face the Creator.
[03:03:30.443 --> 03:03:32.766]  I know there's a spiritual realm.
[03:03:32.766 --> 03:03:35.290]  Mathematics and science shows it.
[03:03:35.290 --> 03:03:35.910]  I know
[03:03:37.418 --> 03:03:39.941]  That you do what you do because you're weak.
[03:03:39.941 --> 03:03:43.505]  I know and I am so sad for you.
[03:03:43.505 --> 03:03:54.998]  That you're so cowardly that you try to act tough and powerful and try to be in big invincible gangs, you think, who go around abusing people by looking at all the angles to do it in the safest possible way.
[03:03:54.998 --> 03:03:56.540]  You're the opposite of warriors.
[03:03:57.361 --> 03:03:59.282]  You're the opposite of honorable.
[03:03:59.282 --> 03:04:02.004]  A warrior takes on 10 to 1.
[03:04:02.004 --> 03:04:04.947]  A warrior wants to truly be challenged and fight evil.
[03:04:04.947 --> 03:04:07.008]  A warrior wants to defend innocence.
[03:04:07.008 --> 03:04:09.170]  And you people do the opposite.
[03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:15.194]  You blow up federal buildings and you pick them because they got a daycare center in it so you can grandstand on TV.
[03:04:15.194 --> 03:04:17.336]  And we know the names of the agents that did it.
[03:04:18.653 --> 03:04:21.035]  What hotels you checked into, it's all public.
[03:04:21.035 --> 03:04:24.537]  World Net Daily, Infowars, local TV in that area.
[03:04:24.537 --> 03:04:29.260]  We all know your names and where you planted the bombs and what you did.
[03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:35.525]  And let me tell you, you're not going to escape justice in this life or the next for all those kids you blew up.
[03:04:35.525 --> 03:04:42.069]  Or for the man you executed at his house for whatever reason.
[03:04:42.069 --> 03:04:43.250]  You're not going to get away with it.
[03:04:44.383 --> 03:04:46.764]  You will be brought to justice and you know that.
[03:04:46.764 --> 03:04:51.226]  And I know it ruins it for you that we're not afraid and don't care what happens.
[03:04:51.226 --> 03:04:54.368]  All that matters is that you be brought to justice.
[03:04:54.368 --> 03:04:58.050]  All that matters is that the New World Order be brought down.
