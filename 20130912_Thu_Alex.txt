[01:08.860 --> 01:19.500]  today we have the father of the friend that lifted weights with Tamerlin Zarnev
[01:19.500 --> 01:27.140]  who was executed by an FBI death squad at his home if he's not threatened to not
[01:27.140 --> 01:31.500]  come on by the time he's scheduled like the mother and the aunt and everybody

[01:41.860 --> 01:49.140]  show because the government's so loving and then the intel we have is that Mr.
[01:49.140 --> 01:57.660]  Todeshev's son was executed because basically Tamerlin had bragged to him
[01:57.660 --> 02:05.100]  that he was working for the CIA in super secret operations in the caucuses
[02:05.100 --> 02:09.180]  that's the intel we got early on I predicted they would hunt down their
[02:09.180 --> 02:14.340]  friends and kill them they were absolute patsies that took part in the drill
[02:14.340 --> 02:21.180]  there is uncontrovertible masses of triangulated evidence where each piece of
[02:21.180 --> 02:24.940]  the evidence doesn't prove it but you triangulate them and lay them over it's
[02:24.940 --> 02:29.420]  all there the drill the stand down the older brother working for a CIA sponsored
[02:29.420 --> 02:34.180]  program out of Georgetown University under Brzezinski the uncle being

[02:38.820 --> 02:44.060]  screaming at police we didn't do it the cops being killed turned out not by them
[02:44.060 --> 02:49.020]  they didn't rob a 7-eleven on and on them trying to kill him in the boat he's
[02:49.020 --> 02:52.900]  pled not guilty you never really hear that in the news and I've talked to the

[03:09.180 --> 03:15.820]  college and this is what they do to them and the guys were into boxing they were
[03:15.820 --> 03:21.220]  wearing sunglasses they were wearing you know designer clothes driving around in
[03:21.220 --> 03:28.500]  fancy cars where'd all the money come from the intel I've got well I'm not even
[03:28.500 --> 03:33.260]  gonna get into it we're going to find out exactly why the FBI he said they're

[04:21.940 --> 04:28.460]  establishment state-run media and basically came after me and now they've
[04:28.460 --> 04:32.340]  said on MSNBC other places that I'm actually behind the bombing see I point
[04:32.340 --> 04:37.500]  out the globalists are behind it so their answer is no you're behind it now

[05:22.620 --> 05:26.820]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when

[11:14.780 --> 11:19.980]  once with the aunt and then she calls back crying and just says I love my
[11:19.980 --> 11:25.340]  children I'm not going to sacrifice them fine evil is winning I will not let
[11:25.340 --> 11:30.340]  the evil get my you know get my son fine evil wins please don't kill me you
[11:30.340 --> 11:33.780]  know talking to the people listening on the phone I mean that's that's how
[11:33.780 --> 11:37.740]  incredible this type of stuff is and by the way they'll come to your house and
[11:37.740 --> 11:41.180]  shoot you in the back of the head and then say that they were wounded and then
[11:41.180 --> 11:44.700]  it turned out oh we weren't wounded he didn't even assault us then they just
[11:44.700 --> 11:48.180]  declare national security I mean will they come to my house shoot me in the
[11:48.180 --> 11:56.220]  back of the head I'm tied down in a chair and then that'll just be the end of
[11:56.220 --> 12:02.380]  it so so so this is the NDAA and this is what they do to people that find out
[12:02.380 --> 12:09.980]  about Tamerlan Tsarnav working for the Central Intelligence Agency they send an
[12:09.980 --> 12:15.100]  FBI hit squad to your house to tie you down in a chair and shoot you right in
[12:15.100 --> 12:19.300]  the back in the top of the head just right where the head curves back over
[12:19.300 --> 12:26.060]  towards the back boom never saw it coming did you absolutely devastatingly
[12:26.060 --> 12:33.940]  disgusting so that is the tyranny that we live under and that is the peril that
[12:33.940 --> 12:40.700]  we're all in and once evil like this gets rolling it's very hard to stop it
[12:40.700 --> 12:44.220]  the good news is people not just in America but worldwide are waking up to
[12:44.220 --> 12:50.100]  this evil and are starting to get find their courage because you should all be
[12:50.100 --> 12:58.300]  afraid of letting the tyrants get control you should all be concerned about
[12:58.300 --> 13:02.820]  them successfully intimidating everybody and taking over then the long dark
[13:02.820 --> 13:13.220]  winter comes then the great tyranny comes then the true persecution begins if
[13:13.220 --> 13:17.940]  you listen to what Alexander Schultz and Eatzen said will you guys print me the
[13:17.940 --> 13:21.300]  oh how we burn in the camps Alexander Schultz and Eatzen gulag archipelago
[13:21.300 --> 13:25.700]  quote thank you so much I I want to actually read that on air today instead
[13:25.700 --> 13:29.100]  of just paraphrasing it
[13:32.820 --> 13:41.540]  I'll be honest with you right now I am so blown away by the magnitude of what is
[13:41.540 --> 13:47.420]  historically happening worldwide the good the bad and the ugly that Chris
[13:47.420 --> 13:52.060]  Jordan rep for the show started said man you seem flustered today you seem
[13:52.060 --> 14:02.700]  upset today you seem like something's wrong and he's absolutely right the
[14:02.700 --> 14:11.820]  magnitude of how good the things are going the magnitude of how bad things
[14:11.820 --> 14:18.540]  are going the sheer scale of how serious this is and how real this all is and
[14:18.540 --> 14:24.540]  how right I've been for 18 years studying history and then overlaying it in
[14:24.540 --> 14:28.380]  human patterns with what was currently happening and then projecting into the
[14:28.380 --> 14:32.660]  future but so much of it is just put in white papers by the establishment
[14:32.660 --> 14:37.380]  themselves but to come to grips with the fact that a the plan is real and it's
[14:37.380 --> 14:41.900]  really happening and we're living in a nightmare science fiction movie but b
[14:41.900 --> 14:46.500]  and I think probably even more important the animating contest of liberty is
[14:46.500 --> 14:53.100]  igniting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and liberty is
[14:53.100 --> 14:59.540]  rising in the face of this tyranny and it's so incredible to be alive here at
[14:59.540 --> 15:07.260]  this time and this juncture and then to get advised by a lot of really high
[15:07.260 --> 15:13.260]  powered media people off record off record you know who those people are
[15:13.260 --> 15:24.300]  it's always off record that info wars.com prison planet.com this radio
[15:24.300 --> 15:30.140]  show what I do with my team and with you the listeners who are all part of the
[15:30.140 --> 15:36.340]  team all out there trying to awaken people is being viewed and listened to
[15:36.340 --> 15:42.820]  intensely from Japan to Russia to England to France to South Africa to
[15:42.820 --> 15:52.900]  Israel to Mexico to Brazil to Chile to China to Indonesia to the highest
[15:52.900 --> 15:58.300]  councils of government and this is what I get from many different high powered
[15:58.300 --> 16:02.180]  sources and we can see I should have my writers look at the IP addresses of the
[16:02.180 --> 16:07.420]  media not just the NSA not just the FBI not just the CIA I don't mean I get
[16:07.420 --> 16:11.700]  hundreds of visits from those each agencies we get thousands of visits a
[16:11.700 --> 16:21.500]  day from the NSA the CIA thousands a day from ABC NBC CBS Fox all their
[16:21.500 --> 16:28.180]  affiliates I mean it's incredible the whole world watching what we're doing
[16:28.180 --> 16:32.260]  right now and I don't mean a lot of the masses out there working 15 hours a day
[16:32.260 --> 16:36.140]  and going home and watching football I mean the media the governments the
[16:36.140 --> 16:42.500]  Pentagon and to go out on the street and walk by troops in half of them on average
[16:42.500 --> 16:46.620]  come over and shake my hand and you've heard the callers say you know that's
[16:46.620 --> 16:50.660]  about who's awake and who's listening and to learn about the highest levels of
[16:50.660 --> 16:57.340]  media focusing on what we do and governments and to now go to a rock
[16:57.340 --> 17:01.300]  and roll concert and there are people all over the place wearing info wars shirts
[17:01.300 --> 17:09.420]  a lot of them that aren't even ours and to then not have every 10th person I
[17:09.420 --> 17:13.380]  walked by come over and shake my hand but to have like you know first five
[17:13.380 --> 17:17.020]  people then 10 then 20 to where you actually get scared because I've been
[17:17.020 --> 17:20.340]  in these crowds before when 100 up and pile up and then 200 it's like rugby
[17:20.340 --> 17:24.100]  they're about to crush you and I had to literally run backstage because so many
[17:24.100 --> 17:27.940]  of my listeners were there and that's not me up here saying oh I'm a narcissist
[17:27.940 --> 17:36.620]  over so big it's a radar ping it's a radar ping or sonar ping on man wow and
[17:36.620 --> 17:42.020]  we're just one part of the resistance the responsibility of that I can hardly
[17:42.020 --> 17:45.860]  do the show I mean I'm not getting psyched out or anything but when I
[17:45.860 --> 17:51.980]  really start thinking about millions of people every hour listening and then
[17:51.980 --> 18:00.620]  who's listening and then you ask yourself why me well why why are people and
[18:00.620 --> 18:04.380]  and the answer is I did an old-fashioned thing I didn't listen to mainstream
[18:04.380 --> 18:09.500]  media I studied history and I read white papers and I watched c-span and I read
[18:09.500 --> 18:13.940]  let's not exaggerate 150 200 books I don't know on World War two alone a
[18:13.940 --> 18:17.540]  hundred on British naval history I mean I got a dick I don't even have time to
[18:17.540 --> 18:20.260]  read anymore because all this work but I used to read every night until like two
[18:20.260 --> 18:23.100]  three in the morning my wife would be like good God do you ever sleep kind of
[18:23.100 --> 18:26.580]  went through a phase of that as well and I just what humans have done in the
[18:26.580 --> 18:29.900]  past they do again and again and I didn't discover that everybody knows
[18:29.900 --> 18:34.740]  that those that don't know history or do them to repeat it I know what they're
[18:34.740 --> 18:38.060]  going to do because I've studied history and I read their own white papers and
[18:38.060 --> 18:42.940]  then you figure out most these governments and people don't most the
[18:42.940 --> 18:48.180]  media they just repeat the talking points that come down the chain and then
[18:48.180 --> 18:54.140]  you start realizing that most people even who are very intelligent they want
[18:54.140 --> 18:58.380]  to go play golf they want to go see their girlfriend they want to go to the
[18:58.380 --> 19:04.980]  art event they want to go to the opera they want to go to the NASCAR race they
[19:04.980 --> 19:10.900]  want to go fishing and I don't blame them I guess it's that I'm focused at
[19:10.900 --> 19:14.820]  least most the time so much so that then I don't even function at a good level on
[19:14.820 --> 19:19.580]  what's happening I can't do I dream about this stuff I'm in the shower

[24:15.460 --> 24:20.220]  all right here's the bottom line I'm trying to break down for you liberty is
[24:20.220 --> 24:28.140]  extremely popular and the only reason info wars is so popular and the radio
[24:28.140 --> 24:33.540]  show is that people are waking up it's not even so much that we're waking them
[24:33.540 --> 24:38.260]  up that they're already waking up and just taking their awareness to a higher
[24:38.260 --> 24:43.260]  level by finding this radio broadcast they're only hearing things here that
[24:43.260 --> 24:49.700]  they already basically already knew but it's allowing people to know that there's
[24:49.700 --> 24:56.780]  a wider resistance that's what I'm trying to get at here and now I see fleets
[24:56.780 --> 25:02.420]  of people joining the ranks of what has been called the alternative or grassroots
[25:02.420 --> 25:09.500]  media and really giving the establishment not a run for its money but
[25:09.500 --> 25:18.180]  bringing it down and we are the real media this is the born-again media
[25:18.180 --> 25:21.860]  because there hasn't been a real media for 50 60 years in this country to a
[25:21.860 --> 25:25.460]  great extent there's been people following party lines pulled out by
[25:25.460 --> 25:29.820]  think tanks put out by government put out by the major networks that are on
[25:29.820 --> 25:33.900]  record having their news packaged by psych warfare chiefs that's all
[25:33.900 --> 25:39.500]  declassified now because before it was illegal they were doing it secretly now
[25:39.500 --> 25:50.900]  it's public and so the mainstream media is dead it's not dying it's dead and they
[25:50.900 --> 25:55.900]  narcissistically have not even figured that out yet they're still to a great
[25:55.900 --> 26:01.980]  extent in their own world thinking that they're running the show they realize
[26:01.980 --> 26:05.100]  they're losing influence they realize they've got a change but they still
[26:05.100 --> 26:10.500]  instinctively because their narcissist are into the imaginary world that they
[26:10.500 --> 26:15.980]  are these you know TV movie stars these these these these news celebrities
[26:15.980 --> 26:21.340]  because they got into it to be news celebrities and so they're like a little
[26:21.340 --> 26:24.300]  local band that has a hundred people that come out to see it every Saturday
[26:24.300 --> 26:29.620]  night who think they're celebrities they think with their 400,000 viewers on
[26:29.620 --> 26:34.980]  Piers Morgan when he's to be 10 million a decade ago in that same time slot he
[26:34.980 --> 26:39.140]  really thinks he's a big star and the rest the dinosaur media sits there and
[26:39.140 --> 26:43.500]  you know props each other up in a big vanity fair emperors new clothes and
[26:43.500 --> 26:50.220]  together sharing their little bit of draining power they still have a glint
[26:50.220 --> 26:54.780]  of what they had but but but but but it's a fading spark it's burning out right
[26:54.780 --> 27:00.620]  now they're dead let me announce to you and I've talked to a lot of the top
[27:00.620 --> 27:06.980]  media people in the world folks and they concur there it is undoubted route of
[27:06.980 --> 27:12.380]  the establishment route of the New World Order route of their propaganda arms
[27:12.380 --> 27:17.100]  we are the media we are not the alternative media we're not humble
[27:17.100 --> 27:23.100]  bloggers that's what I'm always telling my crew don't be on a power trip but
[27:23.100 --> 27:29.540]  realize how historical this is and and really get dialed into the info and with
[27:29.540 --> 27:33.660]  the cutting edge of what's happening don't just think of ourselves as podunk
[27:33.660 --> 27:37.540]  because we're in Austin Texas we're here because we don't want to be influenced
[27:37.540 --> 27:42.260]  by New York or influenced by DC or influenced by Los Angeles we don't want
[27:42.260 --> 27:49.620]  to be influenced by that failing sinking Titanic we're not on that ship and the
[27:49.620 --> 27:55.620]  manifestation of all this as the real media is resurrected it's back from the
[27:55.620 --> 28:01.300]  dead back to the muckrakers of 100 years ago souped up by high-tech systems and
[28:01.300 --> 28:05.380]  if talk radio would figure that out it wouldn't be imploding and it is the
[28:05.380 --> 28:09.780]  only shows surviving now are getting hardcore our libertarian our anti-New
[28:09.780 --> 28:15.220]  World Order are talking about false flag all the shows now Beck Limbaugh every
[28:15.220 --> 28:19.420]  single one of them the first to really start doing this with Savage a decade
[28:19.420 --> 28:23.220]  ago that's why I like Savage because he's so smart the other guys it's more
[28:23.220 --> 28:27.020]  talking points more Republican more Republican bilge back is smart enough
[28:27.020 --> 28:31.900]  he's completely jumping ship out of that because the ship is sinking ladies and
[28:31.900 --> 28:36.420]  gentlemen and that's the thing about liberty people always expect we're
[28:36.420 --> 28:40.500]  just losers we're gonna fail tyranny's destined to win there's nothing we can
[28:40.500 --> 28:44.340]  do it's written in the Bible with some New World Order Rockefeller World
[28:44.340 --> 28:49.860]  Council of Churches interpretation no God helps those that helps themselves God
[28:49.860 --> 28:54.660]  gave reprieves to Israel and reprieves to Nineveh and reprieves over and over
[28:54.660 --> 28:59.100]  again in history if they turned from their wicked ways if they hit their
[28:59.100 --> 29:04.820]  knees ask for forgiveness and seek the face of God maybe you don't believe in a
[29:04.820 --> 29:10.740]  physical God what about innocence and your children if you don't see God in
[29:10.740 --> 29:16.300]  the innocence of your children as they say on the road with Vigo Mortensen then
[29:16.300 --> 29:20.580]  you don't have any discernment if you don't see God in the stars and the
[29:20.580 --> 29:25.100]  clouds every day I'm just struck down by the beauty every day driving home last
[29:25.100 --> 29:30.540]  hour the sunset and clouds and the cobalt blue sky I mean it was just
[29:30.540 --> 29:37.100]  enraptured by it that is the revolution recognizing beauty and not getting
[29:37.100 --> 29:41.700]  sucked into the ugliness of the mainstream dying media that's trying to

[33:30.820 --> 33:36.060]  Obama caught lying Wall Street Journal kind of stuff the story out last night
[33:36.060 --> 33:41.380]  lowest learner targeting tea parties they're still targeting tea parties with
[33:41.380 --> 33:46.660]  the IRS this is terrorism this is absolutely impeachable even Piers Morgan
[33:46.660 --> 33:51.620]  had to say this is tyranny and that now he understands why people think we're
[33:51.620 --> 33:56.580]  in danger absolutely tyranny isn't a joke folks giving into corruption because
[33:56.580 --> 34:01.180]  it'll just grow and grow and grow until the worst of the worst are at the center
[34:01.180 --> 34:09.100]  of it and the point I'm telling you here is the tipping point is now in sight we
[34:09.100 --> 34:15.540]  haven't gotten completely over the event horizon yet but we're now in it just
[34:15.540 --> 34:20.020]  like turbulence we start getting ready to go into a storm and a jet I mean the
[34:20.020 --> 34:25.300]  house is a rockin ladies and gentlemen and don't bother knocking Stevie Ray

[34:32.340 --> 34:37.260]  tell my crew I say listen this is a war and you're taking a job here at a place
[34:37.260 --> 34:43.580]  where if the enemy wins you better run to another country I tell people to come
[34:43.580 --> 34:46.860]  to work here this isn't it this isn't a game it isn't a joke we're not looking
[34:46.860 --> 34:52.300]  out the blinds we're not afraid we're just up front 110 percent we're in this
[34:52.300 --> 34:57.620]  fight and I have to remember that myself how real this is most of the rich
[34:57.620 --> 35:02.100]  people I know and I mean really rich people worth hundreds of millions
[35:02.100 --> 35:05.580]  billions of dollars and I know a lot of them a lot of them live here in Austin
[35:05.580 --> 35:11.180]  or dead they have left the United States and I've explained this to you the
[35:11.180 --> 35:14.580]  globalist figured out about five years ago that they'd set in motion an
[35:14.580 --> 35:19.100]  economic collapse to consolidate power but their own people got greedy and
[35:19.100 --> 35:24.420]  overdid it it's kind of like guys loading artillery and setting the
[35:24.420 --> 35:30.820]  detonators on the mortars and dropping one and blowing themselves up that's
[35:30.820 --> 35:35.420]  basically what the globalists have already done but five years in the
[35:35.420 --> 35:42.060]  political time span and in this time span of humanity is like seconds so
[35:42.060 --> 35:47.980]  they drop the mortar they didn't tell you they dropped the mortar and they're
[35:47.980 --> 35:52.100]  running they already ran out the door and that mortar is now beginning to
[35:52.100 --> 35:57.700]  touch down on the ground on the concrete and is about to explode ladies and
[35:57.700 --> 36:01.900]  gentlemen that's why they're digging in with armed guards and militarizing
[36:01.900 --> 36:05.780]  police and shutting up helicopter launch pads with nerve gas in them for the
[36:05.780 --> 36:09.420]  American people and running around and and and and you know the French
[36:09.420 --> 36:12.180]  socialists are saying we'll get our economy going we're going to launch
[36:12.180 --> 36:17.780]  robot assembly lines first and replace people see the singularity starting to
[36:17.780 --> 36:23.580]  happen basically but it's a singularity designed as anti-human by the
[36:23.580 --> 36:27.620]  globalist to checkmate all their competition and the process they've
[36:27.620 --> 36:31.940]  destroyed themselves because that's the thing you don't ever destroy your
[36:31.940 --> 36:35.780]  neighbor and in the end get away with it because the spirit of destroying your
[36:35.780 --> 36:40.380]  neighbor wrongfully when they've not done anything to you is a spirit that
[36:40.380 --> 36:43.460]  isn't going to stop with your neighbor now you're going to destroy your own
[36:43.460 --> 36:48.860]  people you're gonna destroy your own family you don't let that demon out of
[36:48.860 --> 36:54.300]  the bottle and then it just goes away it doesn't just stop having a hunger it's
[36:54.300 --> 37:05.300]  hunger gets stronger so here is the bottom line you are living in the middle
[37:05.300 --> 37:10.100]  of a historical meltdown of biblical proportions there's a lot of great
[37:10.100 --> 37:14.380]  opportunities in it there's a lot of pitfalls in it and the future destiny
[37:14.380 --> 37:19.540]  of humanity is now being decided and I can declare to you not from my own
[37:19.540 --> 37:24.900]  perspective but from many other peoples in history the establishment is a dead
[37:24.900 --> 37:31.820]  fish it's on the side of the river bloated and stinking and we can dress it
[37:31.820 --> 37:36.220]  up put perfume on it all day it's rotting it's rotting fast you know
[37:36.220 --> 37:43.340]  Putin came out and said that it's extremely dangerous to encourage people
[37:43.340 --> 37:50.140]  to see themselves as exceptional and a Democratic senator says he wants to
[37:50.140 --> 37:55.980]  vomit over it and the White House admits that Putin now owns the serious
[37:55.980 --> 38:00.540]  strategy I think he actually owned the globalist that's some of the news up on
[38:00.540 --> 38:05.140]  drudgereport.com also up on drudge report in the middle column is an
[38:05.140 --> 38:13.940]  info wars.com story where general Petraeus got basically mobbed by people
[38:13.940 --> 38:19.660]  who didn't loving everywhere he goes and others globalist go now they get mobbed
[38:19.660 --> 38:26.700]  by people that are angry at him about starting all these wars and being part
[38:26.700 --> 38:38.500]  of all the NSA spying and all the CIA domestic operations people have had
[38:38.500 --> 38:47.500]  enough and it is only going to intensify and the establishment foresaw this they
[38:47.500 --> 38:54.180]  built a marginal line like France did against the Germans that they thought
[38:54.180 --> 38:58.820]  would be able to dumb down humanity shut up paramilitary forces against
[38:58.820 --> 39:03.700]  humanity impoverished humanity is a tool of social control in a permanent
[39:03.700 --> 39:12.740]  peasant class but that has backfired at an ultra massive level because people
[39:12.740 --> 39:17.100]  are getting wise to the fact that the establishment says they want to make us
[39:17.100 --> 39:21.700]  prosperous but in truth they want to make us poor they say they want to make us
[39:21.700 --> 39:25.620]  healthy but in truth they want to make us sick they say they want to enlighten
[39:25.620 --> 39:30.300]  us but in truth they dumb us down they say they want to end racism and class
[39:30.300 --> 39:34.420]  ism and can put in all this compartmentalization when in truth all
[39:34.420 --> 39:39.820]  they do is try to segregate and divide on petty surface issues so we never come
[39:39.820 --> 39:51.220]  together and so the establishment media is dead and the big mega corporations
[39:51.220 --> 39:57.020]  that have robbed the world through monopolies through combines through
[39:57.020 --> 40:02.300]  crony systems they can continue to pay their tithe of propaganda that's the
[40:02.300 --> 40:05.900]  phase we've been in for really five years they can continue to pay their tithe
[40:05.900 --> 40:16.620]  their indulgence to NBC CBS ABC MSNBC all of it but the audience is dwindled
[40:16.620 --> 40:20.020]  down to nothing Fox's audience is beginning to dwindle even though it
[40:20.020 --> 40:24.700]  dwarfs all of them combined because they played the part of the anti-establishment
[40:24.700 --> 40:28.700]  they played the part of the other choice and the only reason they're hanging
[40:28.700 --> 40:33.220]  on to some of their viewers is because they at least are having more
[40:33.220 --> 40:37.820]  libertarian ideas on and more anti-establishment ideas on but the
[40:37.820 --> 40:41.500]  minute a Republican gets in that sells people out of us not Rand Paul or
[40:41.500 --> 40:48.180]  somebody like that Fox News will vaporize Fox News will be dead and they
[40:48.180 --> 40:56.140]  know this if they don't adopt reality and I want to say this about the mainstream
[40:56.140 --> 41:01.740]  media they are the last group to figure out they're dead they consciously know
[41:01.740 --> 41:05.860]  they're in trouble but they still are filled with hubris and and and the
[41:05.860 --> 41:13.380]  imagined tokens of success the fancy studios the the bling of security
[41:13.380 --> 41:18.460]  sycophantically treating other people like they're small to to to ingratiate
[41:18.460 --> 41:22.760]  the egos of the cloistered
[41:22.780 --> 41:33.220]  cogiters of the vomit that spews out of both ends of the dinosaur media and the
[41:33.220 --> 41:38.820]  dinosaur media is now a rotting carcass the only life in it is the insects and
[41:38.820 --> 41:48.300]  the the the mammals the the the the the shrews climbing over it picking picking
[41:48.300 --> 41:56.580]  off the leavings and we are the new media we are the media we are the new
[41:56.580 --> 42:02.900]  life form we are the born-again press the born-again muckraker where it's the
[42:02.900 --> 42:07.500]  story and reality and what's happening in the world that is is what matters
[42:07.500 --> 42:10.300]  that's that's what the renaissance was was about knowing how things worked and
[42:10.300 --> 42:15.540]  being informed and speaking five languages and discovering science and
[42:15.540 --> 42:19.820]  discovering the mysteries because the universe is so beautiful and incredible
[42:19.820 --> 42:24.300]  and amazing that you want to discover the mysteries you're not gonna find the
[42:24.300 --> 42:30.700]  mysteries at a baseball game you're not gonna find the mysteries at a basketball
[42:30.700 --> 42:38.700]  game you're not gonna find the mysteries they're following P. Diddy or chasing
[42:38.700 --> 42:43.260]  after Kim Kardashian they don't want you to ever find the mysteries because
[42:43.260 --> 42:48.460]  they're so incredible you'll never want to look at them again you'll never care
[42:48.460 --> 42:51.780]  about the fancy outfits you won't be impressed by the helicopters and the
[42:51.780 --> 42:55.340]  red carpets it's all about them being the center of the universe instead of the
[42:55.340 --> 42:59.860]  universe being all around us and and then they don't even matter anymore them
[42:59.860 --> 43:03.540]  killing you doesn't matter them coming after you them laughing at you you're
[43:03.540 --> 43:08.020]  free now you don't have any more fear it's all right there and they're all a
[43:08.020 --> 43:13.380]  joke the renaissance is coming the enlightenment is coming the empowerment
[43:13.380 --> 43:16.460]  of humanity is coming and we're gonna have to go through some hell to get
[43:16.460 --> 43:20.980]  there the great test ladies and gentlemen to prove our metal to God but
[43:20.980 --> 43:27.140]  I'm telling you this is the greatest time to ever be alive and my only fear is
[43:27.140 --> 43:33.420]  that I get imprisoned set up killed before I can develop and truly be the
[43:33.420 --> 43:38.260]  leader I should be and that's all you should hope for I don't fear death I
[43:38.260 --> 43:43.340]  don't fear imprisonment I don't fear my name being destroyed I don't fear any of
[43:43.340 --> 43:49.940]  it I only fear the fact that I have weak flesh like everybody else but I also
[43:49.940 --> 43:54.620]  have strong strong heart ladies and gentlemen in a strong spirit as you do
[43:54.620 --> 44:01.100]  and it's the discovery that you are a powerful individual when you choose
[44:01.100 --> 44:05.060]  justice what Putin was saying in his letter is it's dangerous just to say
[44:05.060 --> 44:08.980]  you're exceptional when you've not done anything exceptional in a long time
[44:08.980 --> 44:15.460]  you've been exceptional America and now instead of being exceptional you lie
[44:15.460 --> 44:20.740]  and say that you are exceptional and the media is like how dare him say we're
[44:20.740 --> 44:23.740]  not exceptional if you read what he said he's not what he said he said it's very
[44:23.740 --> 44:26.940]  dangerous to think you're invincible it's very dangerous to think you can
[44:26.940 --> 44:31.180]  push everybody around forever it's very dangerous to live on debt we've done it
[44:31.180 --> 44:36.060]  we've collapsed before it's very dangerous for Napoleon to attack Russia
[44:36.060 --> 44:40.100]  it's very dangerous for Hitler to attack Russia it's very dangerous for you
[44:40.100 --> 44:45.300]  to attack Russia don't push forever don't think you're invincible that's
[44:45.300 --> 44:49.340]  exactly what I've been saying look at the leadership of the New World Order look
[44:49.340 --> 44:53.300]  at those senators and Congress people I mean those guys all look completely
[44:53.300 --> 44:59.020]  mentally ill you look at Vladimir Putin and I'm not about to tell you he's a
[44:59.020 --> 45:03.660]  good guy but he's tied into destiny he's tied in to the larger universe you can
[45:03.660 --> 45:08.660]  see that that's why Bush said he looked into his eyes and saw his soul Vladimir
[45:08.660 --> 45:14.260]  Putin is direct Vladimir Putin is aware Vladimir Putin is is is writing his
[45:14.260 --> 45:17.020]  own letters to the American people you can tell he wrote that himself
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.900]  Vladimir Putin is a real leader even if he represents a very corrupt system that
[45:22.900 --> 45:28.340]  on record he's been trying to fix and end the corruption and paying people to
[45:28.340 --> 45:32.540]  get married and have kids saying we're under eugenics we're dying and and the
[45:32.540 --> 45:37.260]  Russian government saying don't take the guard as he'll shot it's dangerous
[45:39.220 --> 45:44.980]  Russia is a group of people trying to be good because they've just gone through
[45:44.980 --> 45:51.380]  80 plus years of pure evil they've just lost 30 40 percent of their population
[45:51.380 --> 45:54.660]  under eugenics they've had their families broken up they've had the state
[45:54.660 --> 45:59.060]  take their kids they've had the men in black uniforms come to their houses and
[45:59.060 --> 46:02.620]  shake them down and they still have that stuff going on but they're trying to
[46:02.620 --> 46:08.820]  phase it out and Putin is saying you I've been taken over by evil and you are
[46:08.820 --> 46:17.740]  in danger and the response here in the by Menendez who led that committee who
[46:17.740 --> 46:24.460]  liked I mean who came off literally like a sycophantic courtier in some
[46:24.460 --> 46:33.740]  demonic fiefdom and he came off like some evil toady in a court a royal court
[46:33.740 --> 46:37.820]  Putin op-ed made me want to vomit the chairman of the senate farm relations
[46:37.820 --> 46:42.260]  committee with all his scandals completely blackmailed so the New York
[46:42.260 --> 46:46.340]  Times op-ed on Syria pinned by Russian president Vladimir Putin made him want to
[46:46.340 --> 46:53.380]  vomit echoing a feminine sentiment being widely expressed Thursday by Capitol
[46:53.380 --> 46:56.500]  Hill yeah you know sometimes when you're really sick and they need to get some
[46:56.500 --> 47:01.540]  poison out of you they have you take salts to make you throw up and I agree
[47:01.540 --> 47:06.500]  you guys ought to be throwing up you ought to throw up all those demons that
[47:06.500 --> 47:09.900]  are inside of you because you know me let me tell you something I don't
[47:09.900 --> 47:13.820]  romanticize Vladimir Putin but I've looked into him I've watched him I've
[47:13.820 --> 47:16.740]  listened to him that guy's looking you straight in the eye and you can tell
[47:16.740 --> 47:21.420]  what's going on there that guy's actually in charge I look at you guys and
[47:21.420 --> 47:24.980]  you're all just a bunch of toadies paid off by a bunch of corrupt banks that
[47:24.980 --> 47:28.700]  can't even coordinate what they're doing you guys are involved in every evil
[47:28.700 --> 47:32.860]  there is and I can tell something to you guys are freaked out at night I bet you
[47:32.860 --> 47:36.580]  guys have nightmares I'll guarantee you Menendez has nightmares at night I
[47:36.580 --> 47:41.180]  guarantee you John Kerry has nightmares at night John Kerry would have to lay
[47:41.180 --> 47:46.660]  down his hands during the speech and was shaking when Harry Reid comes out and
[47:46.660 --> 47:49.940]  gives these evil pro-war speeches he looks completely freaked out you imagine
[47:49.940 --> 47:53.860]  how dirty it feels even if you're evil and see see these guys didn't didn't
[47:53.860 --> 47:58.580]  sell out just for pure murder and death most of them like their masters did they
[47:58.580 --> 48:02.380]  sold out for petty trinkets of power and they've already had all the petty
[48:02.380 --> 48:14.860]  trinkets of power and they didn't fulfill them and they have the symptom of
[48:14.860 --> 48:19.780]  wickedness written in their eyes but the symptom of slaves these men are
[48:19.780 --> 48:28.620]  zombies to Satan they are not actual operatives and and that's why they're
[48:28.620 --> 48:36.900]  so pathetic America is like a giant vending machine for special interest to
[48:36.900 --> 48:39.820]  get whatever they want out of it and they've whored us up one side and down
[48:39.820 --> 48:44.820]  the other and bloated us and and pumped us up in these big bubbles to just keep
[48:44.820 --> 48:49.180]  their empire going and now it's all coming to the end of the line and no
[48:49.180 --> 48:52.740]  amount of false flags are going to save them no amount of tyranny is going to
[48:52.740 --> 48:57.060]  fix things it'll give them a sugar high for a little while but it dissipates
[48:57.060 --> 49:00.860]  faster and faster and they've noticed that historically show that's what I
[49:00.860 --> 49:04.900]  wanted to get to here today then I'm gonna get it all the news and the guest
[49:04.900 --> 49:07.900]  and open the phones up and take your calls Lou Rockwell's gonna pop in for
[49:07.900 --> 49:10.780]  about 30 minutes we'll take calls first the toll-free number to join us is
[49:10.780 --> 49:16.260]  800-259-9231 and that's why I've been talking about the tipping point that
[49:16.260 --> 49:21.180]  we're now entering but things could spin out of control in that tipping point
[49:21.180 --> 49:25.060]  they could decide to try to go to hot martial law take over the media launch
[49:25.060 --> 49:32.860]  fake cyber attacks they could do anything and that's why it is absolutely
[49:32.860 --> 49:38.060]  essential that all of us be as active as we can now before we get to this point
[49:38.060 --> 49:41.940]  that Alexander Schultz and Ethan wrote in the good luck archipelago oh how we
[49:41.940 --> 49:49.140]  burned in the camps later thinking what would things have been like if every
[49:49.140 --> 49:53.180]  security operative when he went out at night to make an arrest had been
[49:53.180 --> 50:01.620]  uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say goodbye to his family or
[50:01.620 --> 50:06.340]  if during periods of mass arrest as for example in Leningrad when they arrested
[50:06.340 --> 50:09.900]  a quarter of the entire city people are not simply sat there in their layers
[50:09.900 --> 50:14.220]  hauling with terror at every bang on the downstairs door and every step on the
[50:14.220 --> 50:19.340]  staircase but it understood that they had nothing left to lose and had boldly
[50:19.340 --> 50:25.980]  set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes
[50:25.980 --> 50:31.140]  hammers pokers whatever else was in hand the organs of the state would have very
[50:31.140 --> 50:35.180]  quickly suffered a shortage of officers in transport and not withstanding all
[50:35.180 --> 50:39.660]  the Stalin's thirst the cursed machine would have ground to a halt if if we
[50:39.660 --> 50:44.700]  didn't love freedom enough and even more we had no awareness of the real
[50:44.700 --> 50:51.060]  situation we purely and simply deserved everything that happened to us afterwards
[50:51.060 --> 50:55.940]  that's what all the TSA training is it's a rest training so they finally come to
[50:55.940 --> 51:01.300]  take you to kill you you don't resist it's catch and release training you are

[1:00:33.820 --> 1:00:38.660]  ball joins us about 20 minutes and continue with calls and the wife of the
[1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:45.620]  man executed by police Todashev in the new death squads the FBI's formed under
[1:00:45.620 --> 1:00:48.980]  NDAA and they say it's legal actually just go around executing people have
[1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:51.060]  declared national security on it they said we're just gonna start killing
[1:00:51.060 --> 1:00:54.380]  whoever we want when we're talking to his wife we're also lining up the mother
[1:00:54.380 --> 1:01:00.140]  and father and folks as soon so stay with us for that I kind of went into a
[1:01:00.140 --> 1:01:05.340]  rampage last hour of preaching about the fact that it's a facade that the
[1:01:05.340 --> 1:01:08.940]  establishments and control and that illusion has worked up until now but we
[1:01:08.940 --> 1:01:13.460]  have reached the tipping point but the next few years folks is going to be full
[1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:19.500]  steam ahead into that tipping point and as drudge said of drudge report dot com
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:23.540]  that drudge that 2013 with a year of Alex Jones or is the year of Alex Jones
[1:01:23.540 --> 1:01:27.180]  you're not going to have the mainstream media come out and say that and I don't
[1:01:27.180 --> 1:01:35.460]  even think it's the year of Alex Jones it's the year of the mass awakening and
[1:01:35.460 --> 1:01:39.940]  so who can be seen as the most radical who accurately predicted a lot of what
[1:01:39.940 --> 1:01:46.540]  was happening my I have but I'm just some symbol to pick out I'm nothing
[1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:51.620]  yeah you can put it back up you just not take the bug down so people can
[1:01:51.620 --> 1:01:54.420]  actually read it that's what I was directing I'm the only radio guy
[1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:57.160]  directing the TV show at the same time you're a radio listener like what's
[1:01:57.160 --> 1:02:01.420]  this guy talking about he said privately told friends would be here of Alex
[1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:05.700]  Jones never met or talked with the man but one hell of a broadcast in such a
[1:02:05.700 --> 1:02:14.660]  marginalized media and that's basically what we're talking about here and now I
[1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:19.260]  do realize going out in public it's not every fifth or tenth person that stops
[1:02:19.260 --> 1:02:23.260]  and as a listener it's like every other person and they're not just passively oh
[1:02:23.260 --> 1:02:26.900]  I know you are you're that conspiracy guy it's I love what you're doing man oh my
[1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:30.780]  whole family's waking up and again the good news is I'm telling you people are
[1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:34.820]  awake the last few years because the numbers intensify of people that you
[1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:38.460]  tell me they're awake and it's not just where I live in Austin Texas I can go to
[1:02:38.460 --> 1:02:44.140]  England I can go to Honduras I can go to you know Serbia I've had family in
[1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:47.780]  Serbia and they're like my god there's info or stickers and people wearing
[1:02:47.780 --> 1:02:52.500]  info or shirts and you know they and they'll cook you like taxi drivers I had
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:57.580]  family in France and then and in Italy my parents go to Europe a lot and they've
[1:02:57.580 --> 1:03:02.020]  had taxi cab drivers repeatedly go Alex Jones is a great American I like
[1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:06.340]  Americans I think Alex Jones is what you know America stands for and I'm not
[1:03:06.340 --> 1:03:09.620]  saying that that's what they say in Europe it's bizarre and they go well
[1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:13.500]  we're his parents and the people for like days will drive them for free and
[1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:19.740]  take care of them and everything and and that's in Italy and in France that's
[1:03:19.740 --> 1:03:25.140]  happened to my parents cab drivers will start telling them about Alex Jones and
[1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:28.620]  they'll say well we're his parents and then the person basically valets them
[1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:33.900]  for days I mean it's bizarre folks and I don't ever tell those stories you know
[1:03:33.900 --> 1:03:38.380]  to get up there and brag it's no brag just fact who was the famous Western actor
[1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:41.460]  that said that no brag just fact but it's not about me it's actually very
[1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:45.260]  humbling I mean I don't even put makeup on it's up to you on TV all the sun
[1:03:45.260 --> 1:03:49.380]  damage hair is falling out we're in a white t-shirt on the radio TV I don't
[1:03:49.380 --> 1:03:53.860]  even care about all that I'm telling you though this show is growing
[1:03:53.860 --> 1:03:59.500]  exponentially and I don't know what to do but just keep doing what I've been
[1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:03.780]  doing and I'm trying to redesign the websites to be more serious and focused
[1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:07.460]  exactly as people told us the site should be that's even what I said two
[1:04:07.460 --> 1:04:14.300]  years ago the exact same thing I'm trying to get the TV launched I'm trying to get
[1:04:14.300 --> 1:04:17.900]  it all done and I know that the advice is good I've been given that I need to
[1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:23.440]  focus on this show and what I cover in the radio because that's what's really
[1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:27.540]  reaching everything I'm so busy literally deciding what kind of light bulbs to
[1:04:27.540 --> 1:04:32.260]  put in that but but I'm just brainstorming on air folks because because
[1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:35.340]  because I don't know what to do with the phenomenon that this broadcast has
[1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:41.620]  become and of course the establishment media the state-run dead media is not
[1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:46.340]  gonna herald that they're just gonna put subliminals in saying I'm a racist or
[1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:49.860]  I've been mean to women on Miller Riley with no evidence or or I'm behind
[1:04:49.860 --> 1:04:56.660]  terrorist bombings on MSNBC because they're scared and they should be and
[1:04:56.660 --> 1:05:02.620]  because we only represent you folks why does the United States spend the largest
[1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:06.460]  percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do we have the highest
[1:05:06.460 --> 1:05:12.140]  cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every other
[1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:18.140]  major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is

[1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:07.300]  to put al-qaeda in charge we took out our own guy in Egypt we're putting al-qaeda
[1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:12.540]  in charge now shut up then we can have al-qaeda attack the West and take all

[1:10:17.260 --> 1:10:21.180]  and available to rape women and chop heads off they're just like us they're
[1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:25.540]  after our own heart they're sorcerers of death construction and they are our
[1:10:25.540 --> 1:10:31.260]  children that's the reality the New World Order is in the New World Order
[1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:37.140]  business of killing sovereign countries and waging war against the innocent
[1:10:37.140 --> 1:10:48.140]  ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 12th day of September 2013 and we are
[1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:59.740]  crossing into the tipping point the event horizon can you feel it I know you
[1:10:59.740 --> 1:11:04.180]  can and they know you have that subconscious feeling of major change
[1:11:04.180 --> 1:11:07.740]  happening so they won't tell you that anxiety you're having it's over al-qaeda
[1:11:07.740 --> 1:11:11.620]  and we're like but you run al-qaeda you're right that's not the threat now
[1:11:11.620 --> 1:11:14.700]  it's the veterans and the gun owners and people who like George Washington I
[1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:18.060]  want to make the world a better place that's an exact quote Department of
[1:11:18.060 --> 1:11:22.340]  Defense training manual imagine being officers in the in the Army or the
[1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:25.460]  Marines and being taught George Washington wouldn't be welcome in
[1:11:25.460 --> 1:11:31.060]  today's Marine Corps boy George Washington wouldn't be welcome in today's
[1:11:31.060 --> 1:11:38.500]  Army that is the founder of the US Army the first member of the US Army the
[1:11:38.500 --> 1:11:46.100]  man that started the country with the US Army and they dared said that is
[1:11:46.100 --> 1:11:51.580]  absolute blasphemy if you love this Republic these people are infidel
[1:11:51.580 --> 1:12:02.460]  defilers of our Republic and are the enemy enemies ancient enemies how to
[1:12:02.460 --> 1:12:05.740]  try not to act like this folks I just think about these murderers and
[1:12:05.740 --> 1:12:11.860]  everything they've done and how they must be dealt with and the spirit of
[1:12:11.860 --> 1:12:19.960]  liberty ladies and gentlemen is rising can you not feel it and at the same
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:28.100]  time are you getting so upset this guy's crazy yeah I just know all over
[1:12:28.100 --> 1:12:31.500]  Austin Texas babies are being born today where I live and they're being
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:35.660]  injected on purpose with deadly vaccines that are giving them basically 20
[1:12:35.660 --> 1:12:42.260]  point or more IQ reductions on the spot I mean that's attempted murder and I
[1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:45.660]  shouldn't get upset see I can't use physical violence because they set it up
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:48.980]  in this stage of the game they can beat us if we do that right now so I'm
[1:12:48.980 --> 1:12:53.300]  savaging them with the First Amendment and that is a weapon that's why it
[1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:56.900]  comes first I am using it as it was meant to be used with the sort of truth
[1:12:56.900 --> 1:13:01.980]  viciously attacking the enemy and trying to get people out of their drug
[1:13:01.980 --> 1:13:08.260]  induced mind poisoned comas to realize that we're under attack and have the
[1:13:08.260 --> 1:13:13.660]  enemy overrunning us and if we ever woke up we outnumber them a thousand to
[1:13:13.660 --> 1:13:20.380]  one and it's over so I'm literally standing in your bedroom while you're
[1:13:20.380 --> 1:13:24.340]  in a coma and the house is on fire and the rafters are coming down and my
[1:13:24.340 --> 1:13:27.740]  shirt's on fire and I'm going I gotta get out of here we either got to put this
[1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:31.020]  house out or get out of here this is a red-level emergency you're gonna open
[1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:35.940]  in here I'll get your nightcap on you know let's see the crazy man and you're
[1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:40.020]  even coughing does the smoke of the New World Order and you're like that that's
[1:13:40.020 --> 1:13:51.580]  smoke it's far that's a conspiracy theory nothing ever bad what happened I am
[1:13:51.580 --> 1:13:57.220]  the madness of liberty responding to the madness of tyranny
[1:14:02.260 --> 1:14:08.540]  because true freedom is madness you know madness is associated with high IQ
[1:14:08.540 --> 1:14:13.260]  with with with with art with moments of clarity the globalist they they follow
[1:14:13.260 --> 1:14:18.380]  their dark flame of death and destruction that is their their madness we
[1:14:18.380 --> 1:14:23.540]  have our madness the animating contest of liberty that is so much greater and
[1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:26.660]  better if we'll only discover that I said I'd go to your calls one time right
[1:14:26.660 --> 1:14:30.820]  now the blue rock was coming up and back to your phone calls Putin has written a
[1:14:30.820 --> 1:14:34.380]  heartfelt letter to the American people to not start World War three and to take
[1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:36.700]  the chemical weapons out that were clearly a pretext and launched
[1:14:36.700 --> 1:14:41.820]  al-Qaeda and our media saying how dare you scum we will have war we will have
[1:14:41.820 --> 1:14:46.060]  murder we will have death we are trendy we are liberal peace price peace price
[1:14:46.060 --> 1:14:53.220]  peace price war is peace and meanwhile US weapons are reaching Syrian rebels
[1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:56.340]  that's in the Washington Post Paul Watson has it all written up in detail
[1:14:56.340 --> 1:15:02.780]  info wars.com black jihadist flies flag over Christian town that they
[1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:09.420]  destroyed and put the Catholics to death so there you go and the Pope is
[1:15:09.420 --> 1:15:13.100]  refusing Assad's calls and desperate pleas to save the Christian minorities
[1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:16.860]  protected well I'm not criticizing the Pope really I think that's up to
[1:15:16.860 --> 1:15:21.060]  Catholics to do that but I really think people ought to be of the your Catholic
[1:15:21.060 --> 1:15:24.620]  especially their murder and Catholics by the thousands every day over there CIA
[1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:28.860]  begins delivering weapons to al-Qaeda and Syria curtain I wrote about that in
[1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:34.540]  detail beyond the Washington Post David Petraeus ambushed branded war
[1:15:34.540 --> 1:15:38.300]  criminal by protesters that's up on info wars.com and prisonblood.com
[1:15:38.300 --> 1:15:42.580]  Putin's letter to America he actually just put it out in the New York Times
[1:15:42.580 --> 1:15:45.180]  published it with everybody's oh New York Times got it New York Times got it
[1:15:45.180 --> 1:15:49.140]  prepare for tough times if your job is anything to do with real estate and
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:53.460]  mortgages another one is this while Obama's so desperate for a nice little
[1:15:53.460 --> 1:15:58.700]  war and zero hedges reporting GLD ETF investors unable to get physical gold
[1:15:58.700 --> 1:16:01.460]  that's because the market's been manipulated gold's a lot more than what
[1:16:01.460 --> 1:16:04.340]  they actually say it is in physical reality and that manipulation is now
[1:16:04.340 --> 1:16:08.900]  coming to the surface like a cold sore 9-11 Commission chair director of
[1:16:08.900 --> 1:16:12.500]  intelligence James Clapper should be indicted for perjury yeah he publicly
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:16.700]  perjured himself US can't prove Bashar Assad provided chemical weapons to Syria
[1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:20.340]  Washington Times yeah that's to say the least well we have jihadi's loading the
[1:16:20.340 --> 1:16:24.220]  chemical weapons on all these videos let's go to your phone calls right now
[1:16:24.220 --> 1:16:31.020]  ladies and gentlemen and then Obama of vomit the demon frontman the old
[1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:38.140]  president day of El Diablo he has been caught lying oh it turns out they have
[1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:42.500]  the command orders to persecute the real tea party you know the enemy people
[1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:47.260]  that like George Washington let's talk to Ben in Missouri you're on the air sir
[1:16:47.260 --> 1:16:51.740]  go ahead hey Alex so it's a pleasure to speak with you again the second time I've
[1:16:51.740 --> 1:16:56.660]  been on the air I just want to well first of all give a quick shout out to
[1:16:56.660 --> 1:17:02.900]  the great people that I met on the overpass protest in Richmond Heights the
[1:17:02.900 --> 1:17:08.380]  terrorist thing oh oh they were gonna ban you and arrested people who went and
[1:17:08.380 --> 1:17:11.860]  did it but then the next week five times more showed up there so they backed
[1:17:11.860 --> 1:17:15.780]  off and the same thing they told the motorcyclists they couldn't go through
[1:17:15.780 --> 1:17:21.500]  DC so they just defied them see how that works I'm sorry go ahead exactly
[1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:28.940]  so I just wanted to share a quick story with you and the listeners about well
[1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:33.220]  you think he's actually he doesn't seem like such a bad guy he's a friend of mine
[1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:37.220]  I can't I don't want to say who he is but I'm sure telling this story if
[1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:41.900]  anybody who knows him the listening will know who I'm speaking about this is a
[1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:49.580]  guy who I play hockey with every Thursday night and he's a really really rich guy
[1:17:49.580 --> 1:17:53.300]  talking like hundreds of millions of dollars somebody who's bought and sold
[1:17:53.300 --> 1:18:01.380]  businesses tell me about him well I was talking to him and you know I was
[1:18:01.380 --> 1:18:04.340]  having one of these moments when I was getting getting myself worked up about
[1:18:04.340 --> 1:18:10.860]  about you know what's going on in the world today and I said said to him you
[1:18:10.860 --> 1:18:14.900]  know let me just ask you straight up because you know you've traveled you've
[1:18:14.900 --> 1:18:22.340]  been tied in with everything is there an evil cabal of you genesis who are
[1:18:22.340 --> 1:18:25.620]  trying to control the world we're trying to take over the world who want to kill
[1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:31.180]  us all and you look to me in the eye and he said yes and it was just it was a
[1:18:31.180 --> 1:18:35.220]  mind-blowing mind-blowing moment and so I took it one step further because I was
[1:18:35.220 --> 1:18:38.900]  trying to figure out if I could if I could get this guy to say no to anything
[1:18:38.900 --> 1:18:45.700]  so I said to him well that's crazy so I said have they literally sold their soul
[1:18:45.700 --> 1:18:51.260]  to the devil in order to get the to get the power that they have and he looked
[1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:57.100]  to me in the eye and he said yes and I said you know this beyond he was like
[1:18:57.100 --> 1:19:01.500]  yes I was like but you don't even believe in you know God the devil stuff
[1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:06.340]  like that so you backtracked a little bit and said well you know because they're
[1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:09.660]  willing to do things they're of the devil because they're willing to do
[1:19:09.660 --> 1:19:13.060]  things because they're willing to build their business on the destruction of
[1:19:13.060 --> 1:19:17.940]  human life and you know basically yeah that's it even if the devil isn't real
[1:19:17.940 --> 1:19:23.060]  they have become the devil exactly what they will do whatever it takes to
[1:19:23.060 --> 1:19:26.500]  enrich themselves to get the power because that's all they want they're
[1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:30.500]  they're terrible people and I it was really shocking to me you it was it's
[1:19:30.500 --> 1:19:34.660]  kind of a thing where you have to you know know I've never talked to a high
[1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:38.460]  powered person that didn't know all this stuff I mean you don't even get into an
[1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:42.820]  advanced program at MIT or the University of Texas unless you're brought in they
[1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:47.540]  tell you I mean it's like it's a cult folks there's a cult of scientific

[1:24:57.740 --> 1:25:04.260]  Mendes say they want to vomit over Putin insulting us saying we've been great
[1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.980]  friends with America to fight Hitler we want to work with you now please let's
[1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:13.380]  stop war give peace a chance John Lennon and their answer is we want to vomit on
[1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:20.260]  you so I want to get Lou Rockwell who again really has his finger on the pulse
[1:25:20.260 --> 1:25:24.540]  and has predicted so much of this in his writings at Lou Rockwell.com to give us
[1:25:24.540 --> 1:25:30.860]  his take on where we are because Dr. Paul Greg Roberts the New York Sun Conrad
[1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:34.500]  Black all these people have said what I'm saying I see this is the beginning of
[1:25:34.500 --> 1:25:42.700]  the fall of the Soviet Union 1987 if we were East Germany before 1989 1990 1989
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:47.060]  for 1991 I think it's already collapsed the numbers show that dominant media is
[1:25:47.060 --> 1:25:51.460]  no longer dominant Lou Rockwell what's your take on this point we're at in
[1:25:51.460 --> 1:25:55.620]  history sir well it certainly has been going on for a while Alex I mean I think
[1:25:55.620 --> 1:26:01.060]  we can actually trace it back to George Bush and companies invasion of Iraq
[1:26:01.060 --> 1:26:07.740]  into the the real estate bubble the Federal Reserve deliberately created
[1:26:07.740 --> 1:26:12.680]  in order to allegedly make things better and of course the bust from that so we
[1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:16.580] 've had all kinds of economic troubles all kinds of invasions of other
[1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:21.860]  countries bombings of other countries dronings of other countries and I know
[1:26:21.860 --> 1:26:26.380]  the neocons find this very hard to conceive of people don't like to be
[1:26:26.380 --> 1:26:31.020]  bombed they don't like to be drowned they don't want their countries destroyed
[1:26:31.020 --> 1:26:35.780]  in their wedding parties blown up and little children out picking up firewood
[1:26:35.780 --> 1:26:41.460]  blown up by a drone and well who cares about that that's just collateral
[1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:45.900]  damage so I think this has been going on for some time I think it's and you're
[1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:49.900]  absolutely right I think the Empire is beginning to crumble around the edges as
[1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:55.580]  all empires do because they're not economically viable operations so what's
[1:26:55.580 --> 1:27:00.980]  happening right now I think this op-ed by Putin in the New York Times was really
[1:27:00.980 --> 1:27:04.700]  pretty good I mean I'm not a big fan of Putin and everything he's ever been and
[1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:08.340]  everything is ever done but these days he certainly seems to be speaking the
[1:27:08.340 --> 1:27:11.340]  truth friend of mine the other day referred to him as the leader of the
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:15.580]  free world well I said no that's wrong Paul is the leader of the free world but
[1:27:15.580 --> 1:27:19.460]  Putin is acting much more like the leader of the free world than Barack
[1:27:19.460 --> 1:27:24.300]  Obama is well he's acting sane he doesn't want World War three no and you
[1:27:24.300 --> 1:27:26.940]  know that one of the things about the neocons of all was thought they seem to
[1:27:26.940 --> 1:27:32.340]  have a crazy gene I mean they seem to be slightly wacko sadly insane in addition
[1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:35.900]  of being warmongers like the Rockefellers and other interest groups they
[1:27:35.900 --> 1:27:39.740]  they really are nutty and and Putin is right to say look there's something
[1:27:39.740 --> 1:27:44.300]  wrong when you tell the whole world we're exceptional we're the best the
[1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:48.900]  regular rules don't apply to us however we can apply the regular rules to you we
[1:27:48.900 --> 1:27:53.020]  can bomb you we can invade your country we can use any kind of weapon on you
[1:27:53.020 --> 1:27:58.620]  white phosphorus agent orange to you napalm and depleted uranium and so forth
[1:27:58.620 --> 1:28:02.980]  and you can't say boo about it we're allowed to do it because you know we
[1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:07.460]  rule the world we can conquer anybody bomb anybody needless to say people are
[1:28:07.460 --> 1:28:11.500]  sick of that Putin is exactly right it's wrong no country should have that view
[1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:15.300]  various enterprises of course over the course of human history have had that
[1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:20.740]  view ancient Babylon a Syria Egypt a more recently ancient Rome more more
[1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:26.660]  recently still the British Empire Napoleon Empire absolutely so so at the
[1:28:26.660 --> 1:28:31.700]  point we're at my concern is how will the Empire strike back because God forbid
[1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:35.380]  peace is breaking out here I mean they ought to give Putin a peace prize or
[1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:40.180]  Ron Paul a peace prize why not have a movement to recall Obama's peace prize
[1:28:40.180 --> 1:28:44.500]  I think symbolically that would damage this warmonger well it'd be great although
[1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.420]  of course as you know Alex there've been some other creeps who've gotten the
[1:28:47.420 --> 1:28:51.940]  peace prize Henry Kissinger and other other war criminals besides Obama have
[1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:57.220]  gotten it but I'd love to see it withdrawn yes and and I think but what's
[1:28:57.220 --> 1:29:00.420]  happening is it's being withdrawn in the hearts of the American people in the
[1:29:00.420 --> 1:29:04.180]  minds of the American people and then people all around the world no
[1:29:04.180 --> 1:29:08.140]  government can stand against that well that's why they had to try to get a
[1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:12.020]  congressional vote that's why all the propaganda to try to convince us was a
[1:29:12.020 --> 1:29:17.020]  good idea to have yet another anti-Muslim war in the Middle East that
[1:29:17.020 --> 1:29:19.980]  would have resulted in the deaths of millions of Christians and other
[1:29:19.980 --> 1:29:25.340]  religious minorities in Syria so people withdrawing their consent from the
[1:29:25.340 --> 1:29:30.100]  government the government cannot stand against it I think we've got interesting
[1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:34.620]  times ahead from an economic standpoint but from a political standpoint I think
[1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:39.460]  there's much to look forward to well I want to look forward and and break down
[1:29:39.460 --> 1:29:42.380]  what you think is most important with Lou Rockwell of Lou Rockwell comm
[1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:46.500]  straight ahead we're honored to have him we'll be right back to discuss so what

[1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:24.500]  you know you're in deep trouble when your government is run by foreign banks
[1:33:24.500 --> 1:33:28.580]  that are above the law tax exempt who lobby for poor people to have their
[1:33:28.580 --> 1:33:33.860]  taxes raised to give banker bailout money to them or to be forced to buy
[1:33:33.860 --> 1:33:40.700]  overpriced insurance from offshore tax exempt mega corporations and now as
[1:33:40.700 --> 1:33:46.300]  Obamacare comes home to roost as people get laid off to part-time as all the
[1:33:46.300 --> 1:33:50.900]  nightmare unfolds the collectivization of America takes place I don't think it's
[1:33:50.900 --> 1:33:56.140]  gonna go the way Russia went and now our government openly backs al-Qaeda how
[1:33:56.140 --> 1:34:00.180]  did they think they could get away with it Lou Rockwell of the Von Mies
[1:34:00.180 --> 1:34:04.700]  Institute Ron Paul's former chief of staff after Ron Paul one of the greatest
[1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:08.060]  living libertarian icons out there honored to have him joining us video
[1:34:08.060 --> 1:34:13.420]  video Skype there's a lot to talk about the time we have left but my concern is
[1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:17.340]  how do you expect the Empire to strike back there's such a collapse in public
[1:34:17.340 --> 1:34:22.420]  confidence 91 percent in Reuters poll against this 500 to one phone calls in
[1:34:22.420 --> 1:34:28.420]  Congress against it what do you expect the kleptocrats to do face down with a
[1:34:28.420 --> 1:34:35.500]  whole world that's completely fed up well they don't know what to do I think
[1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:38.780]  they're gonna have to back down but we only have to look at their reaction to
[1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:43.540]  the fact that nobody in America and nobody in the world bought their lives
[1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:49.420]  about why there should be a new war on Syria nobody and they didn't clearly
[1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:53.460]  know what to do they kept giving us the same propaganda they kept repeating it
[1:34:53.460 --> 1:34:56.700]  and they had the whole Main Street media of course on their side thank goodness
[1:34:56.700 --> 1:35:02.620]  Alex for alternative media like you this is where people are getting their
[1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:06.740]  information but I also think more and more people are just correctly
[1:35:06.740 --> 1:35:10.500]  distrusting the government they're beginning to agree with the old
[1:35:10.500 --> 1:35:14.500]  British rule was never believe anything until it's been officially denied I
[1:35:14.500 --> 1:35:19.940]  think for example what the great Edward Snowden did in alerting us to what was
[1:35:19.940 --> 1:35:24.380]  going on with the NSA and there's still of course amazing stuff coming out from
[1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:28.860]  Edward Snowden then Glenn Greenwald and the Guardian and so forth so there's I
[1:35:28.860 --> 1:35:33.420]  think that has been a huge undermining of the government I think people don't
[1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:37.260]  trust the government they don't like the government they don't want to be felt up
[1:35:37.260 --> 1:35:41.100]  at the airport I mean they don't want to their taxes raised anybody who's
[1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:45.580]  looking at Obamacare is terrified by it I noticed they haven't they haven't kept
[1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:48.900]  to their own schedule you know was all supposed to have happened by now so I
[1:35:48.900 --> 1:35:52.020]  think even the government is slightly afraid of what the people's reaction is
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:56.740]  going to be when they see what a scam what an expensive disaster or really a
[1:35:56.740 --> 1:36:01.620]  criminal enterprise Obamacare is written by the big pharmaceutical companies and
[1:36:01.620 --> 1:36:04.660]  the big insurance companies health insurance companies wrote that
[1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:08.860]  legislation to benefit themselves certainly not to not to benefit the
[1:36:08.860 --> 1:36:13.180]  rest of us so that's coming ahead people are terrified of it their right to be
[1:36:13.180 --> 1:36:17.980]  terrified of it everything the government is doing is an attack on the
[1:36:17.980 --> 1:36:22.500]  average of Joe I mean that's that's the whole thing and also more and more people
[1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:26.980]  are realizing what you just talked about about the whole bankocracy that we
[1:36:26.980 --> 1:36:31.380]  live in we live in a under rule by big banks big international banks and
[1:36:31.380 --> 1:36:35.220]  cohorts who in cahoots with the central bank the Federal Reserve but again
[1:36:35.220 --> 1:36:39.620]  people are beginning to become wise to this it's why it's so important that we
[1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:44.300]  all try to keep them keep that process going so the people will withdraw their
[1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:49.100]  consent man because the government is only a small minority really a tiny
[1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:54.460]  minority if we consider the real bad guys I mean the average firemen or post
[1:36:54.460 --> 1:36:58.620]  post office guy not it's not our enemy but if you look at the top of the
[1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:03.420]  government the sort of 1% of the population that is part of the
[1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:08.900]  government part of the oligarchy we far outnumber them we don't have to let them
[1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:14.100]  push us around we don't have to let them terrorize us and if we refuse to have
[1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:19.660]  it happen they actually can't get away with it so maybe we'll see Bernanke
[1:37:19.660 --> 1:37:24.420]  having to go to McDonald's to get a job that's that's my that would be my ideal
[1:37:24.420 --> 1:37:28.620]  well you and Ron Paul and others have always said that when the collapse comes
[1:37:28.620 --> 1:37:32.220]  it's key that we've been there the whole time pointing out their inconsistencies
[1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:35.900]  pointing out their lies pointing out that they exempt themselves from what
[1:37:35.900 --> 1:37:40.660]  they do to us that they're the enemy so they can't pose as the savior and and
[1:37:40.660 --> 1:37:46.140]  we've done that they were arrogant for decades denying our existence while we
[1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:51.780]  basically expose them and now they are discovering that they're no longer the
[1:37:51.780 --> 1:37:56.660]  dominant media they are basically dead the establishment has lost all
[1:37:56.660 --> 1:38:01.820]  credibility it was gone for a while but now the emperors you know new clothes
[1:38:01.820 --> 1:38:07.340]  issue is is is clearer than ever how do you expect them to strike back against
[1:38:07.340 --> 1:38:12.020]  the real media and we the people what concerns you on that front Lou Rockwell
[1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:16.060]  well certainly these people are capable of anything I always think that if they
[1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:19.460]  haven't committed some crime it's either because they felt they couldn't get away
[1:38:19.460 --> 1:38:23.060]  with it or they didn't think of it or they thought it was imprudent for
[1:38:23.060 --> 1:38:27.020]  themselves but they never have the reaction oh better not do that that
[1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:31.460]  would be wrong that's that's never the reaction in foreign affairs or in
[1:38:31.460 --> 1:38:37.580]  domestic affairs but they're not all powerful the gun only takes you so far
[1:38:37.580 --> 1:38:41.460]  and there are too few of them to be putting a gun at everybody's head in
[1:38:41.460 --> 1:38:45.340]  ordering us what to do and when you start to see the regime collapse and this has
[1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:49.620]  been true in other countries they lose their own people their own government
[1:38:49.620 --> 1:38:53.780]  employees turn against them because they the decent ones do not want to be
[1:38:53.780 --> 1:39:00.060]  part of what's going on and they don't have any moral authority and they are
[1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:04.780]  very very vulnerable they're going to be become increasingly vulnerable and it's
[1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:11.260]  our job again to as you just mentioned put out the correct word teach people
[1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:15.780]  what the truth is explain how you're being ripped off explain why that does
[1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:20.820]  not have to be and where we're in an entirely new situation there's never
[1:39:20.820 --> 1:39:25.220]  been a government as big as the US government but also a bureaucracy has
[1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:30.340]  got troubles bureaucracy is we all know a very inefficient form of a human
[1:39:30.340 --> 1:39:35.660]  organization we have the biggest most complicated richest most powerful most
[1:39:35.660 --> 1:39:40.140]  rotten bureaucracy ever the US government and it stretches all over the
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:45.220]  world many different countries and it's very very powerful but it's not all
[1:39:45.220 --> 1:39:49.780]  powerful and we're already seeing the thing begin to crumble it's at least
[1:39:49.780 --> 1:39:55.220]  crumbling around the edges so we got to get our our nonviolent hammer and
[1:39:55.220 --> 1:40:00.580]  chisel and you know knock those edges a little bit let the truth in but the power
[1:40:00.580 --> 1:40:08.340]  of the truth in truth will win out the lies and the deceit and the disasters of
[1:40:08.340 --> 1:40:12.500]  these people promulgate on the rest of us to enrich themselves to empower
[1:40:12.500 --> 1:40:17.620]  themselves we don't have to let them get away with it I predict they are not
[1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:21.620]  going to get away with it the economics of the empire is going to bring it down
[1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:26.620]  as Ron Paul has been talking about for decades the this sort of economic
[1:40:26.620 --> 1:40:30.620]  organization can't last we're going to see the dollar no longer be the world
[1:40:30.620 --> 1:40:35.700]  currency so everybody ought to own some gold we ought to we're going to see all
[1:40:35.700 --> 1:40:39.140]  other kinds of things coming apart whether it's the IMF whether that's the
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:46.140]  European Union NATO all World Bank all these John Maynard Keynes organization
[1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:50.380]  set up after World War two are coming to an end exactly as exactly as Henry
[1:40:50.380 --> 1:40:54.660]  Hasslett predicted in the 1940s and showed what was going to happen and
[1:40:54.660 --> 1:40:58.620]  it's indeed happening so they don't have economics on their side they don't
[1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:02.460]  have morality on their side they don't have history on their side they do have
[1:41:02.460 --> 1:41:07.980]  a gun they have a gun but again the gun can only do so much the power of truth
[1:41:07.980 --> 1:41:13.980]  and right can defeat these people and I think people I think future historians
[1:41:13.980 --> 1:41:17.660]  will look back at this time and see this is when the real counter-revolution
[1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:25.180]  began and don't we need it so this is really 1776 I think you could say 2013
[1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:31.900]  is the year the world woke up and it may take a year it may take five years
[1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:37.500]  the the the globalist New World Order is like a rotten heart it could go another
[1:41:37.500 --> 1:41:42.420]  five years or it could blow up tomorrow I just hope that in the collapse of the
[1:41:42.420 --> 1:41:47.300]  Empire we don't have a thermal nuclear war because imagine of other empires on
[1:41:47.300 --> 1:41:51.660]  the verge of collapse would have had these planet crippling or destroying
[1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:56.620]  weapons we probably wouldn't be here that's my concern and the good news is
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:42:01.980]  the military men I talked to know it's a fraud know the systems corrupt they're
[1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:05.740]  not gonna stand by the police I talked to are starting to even wake up and
[1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:09.460]  realize what's happening the corporate people are realizing if we rob
[1:42:09.460 --> 1:42:12.700]  everything then everything collapses and the money's no good people are now
[1:42:12.700 --> 1:42:18.060]  figuring out the end game of where this leads and I hope that cooler minds
[1:42:18.060 --> 1:42:22.540]  cooler minds prevail but take Rand Paul coming out and saying you know it looks
[1:42:22.540 --> 1:42:26.580]  like the rebels are behind it and we don't want to be behind Al Qaeda and Ted
[1:42:26.580 --> 1:42:29.780]  Cruz saying we don't want to be Al Qaeda's Air Force and Ron Paul saying
[1:42:29.780 --> 1:42:33.460]  boldly he thinks that the serious situation was a false flag which has
[1:42:33.460 --> 1:42:38.300]  been pretty much proven to be 99% not just in motive but in facts and Pat
[1:42:38.300 --> 1:42:42.900]  Buchanan coming out and saying Gulf of Tonkin false flag and have all Rush
[1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:48.340]  Limbaugh come out and pretty much say that I mean when you see that and you
[1:42:48.340 --> 1:42:52.700]  see Republicans now who been Republicans coming out and saying you know
[1:42:52.700 --> 1:42:56.460]  what's wrong with these Republicans on this war no no no when the left's not
[1:42:56.460 --> 1:43:01.540]  really doing that with Obama I mean I'm seeing a major sea change it's
[1:43:01.540 --> 1:43:04.660]  absolutely true you know what it is Alex it's like think of the government as
[1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:07.620]  being over you know John Kerry or some of the rich guy in a very expensive
[1:43:07.620 --> 1:43:11.420]  sweater and there's some little guy down at the bottom and he's starting to pull
[1:43:11.420 --> 1:43:15.060]  on a thread and Kerry thinks well that's you know entirely irrelevant but it's
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:18.220]  not irrelevant because soon the whole thing is gonna come off him so that's
[1:43:18.220 --> 1:43:22.620]  that's what's happening this is we're just at the very very beginning of a
[1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:26.980]  historic period and not only in American history but in world history we do have
[1:43:26.980 --> 1:43:30.460]  to fear these people and their thermonuclear weapons but I think that
[1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:34.940]  you know and you just pointed it out I think more and more people in the
[1:43:34.940 --> 1:43:40.300]  military would refuse to as my goodness they certainly should refuse to mass
[1:43:40.300 --> 1:43:45.260]  murder people with atomic weapons just because some banker in Washington orders
[1:43:45.260 --> 1:43:49.060]  them to so just like there were soldiers in this prayer in this current
[1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:53.700]  situation has said you know I'm not going to go to Syria and fight on the
[1:43:53.700 --> 1:43:58.340]  side of Al Qaeda and kill the Christians so when you when you have the
[1:43:58.340 --> 1:44:02.620]  military which happened during the Vietnam War two the military starting
[1:44:02.620 --> 1:44:08.620]  to mutiny starting to rebel against its orders very very good thing so I think
[1:44:08.620 --> 1:44:13.460]  you know I'm nothing is for sure of course and we are we're dealing with
[1:44:13.460 --> 1:44:17.540]  some of the worst people in the history of the human race capable of anything so
[1:44:17.540 --> 1:44:21.660]  this is a struggle but it's always been a struggle a struggle between power and
[1:44:21.660 --> 1:44:26.220]  market all throughout human history so the struggle is intensified but now for
[1:44:26.220 --> 1:44:30.860]  the first time in a very long time the good guys have got the advantage we have
[1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:34.740]  to push that we have to take the advantage we have to make sure that we
[1:44:34.740 --> 1:44:39.300]  show the truth about the creeps who oppose us what their plans are how they
[1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:43.180]  want to hurt regular people to enrich themselves how they love starting wars
[1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:49.140]  they love killing people they're very nasty bunch but good is in the great
[1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:54.700]  majority and we you know we have to do our job nothing is automatic we can't
[1:44:54.700 --> 1:44:58.420]  just sit back and expect it to happen but if we all educate ourselves if we
[1:44:58.420 --> 1:45:03.820]  all try to educate others if we all try to spread the ideas of freedom I think
[1:45:03.820 --> 1:45:11.180]  we'll win speaking of their their in-game strategy that they've all
[1:45:11.180 --> 1:45:16.020]  basically written about they've decided to make the singularity in computers
[1:45:16.020 --> 1:45:20.980]  and robotics and manufacturing and industry an anti-human program where
[1:45:20.980 --> 1:45:27.180]  we're not needed and so for the first time oligarchs can can can can use
[1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:32.060]  machines to get rid of the labor that they've never really wanted and so
[1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:35.940]  they're almost buying into a Karl Marx type idea but instead of people having
[1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:39.140]  to work one day a week and living like kings they've decided to bring in a
[1:45:39.140 --> 1:45:44.380]  21 to have government siphon off so much resources to make us poor to make us
[1:45:44.380 --> 1:45:48.140]  peasants they all write books about this I it's it's how they admit their crimes
[1:45:48.140 --> 1:45:53.060]  and then now the socialist over in France he's come out the president said
[1:45:53.060 --> 1:45:57.380]  robots replacing French workers will get France going again and let the
[1:45:57.380 --> 1:46:01.220]  socialist class who's exempt from taxes as they've been caught have hundred
[1:46:01.220 --> 1:46:06.660]  plus percent taxes on the nouveau riche and the middle class and so as all that
[1:46:06.660 --> 1:46:10.420]  happens they're going to go to automation automated factories automated
[1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:16.140]  drones same thing MIT and the Pentagon say is that soon it won't matter if the
[1:46:16.140 --> 1:46:20.620]  troops won't fire the cruise missiles it'll be up to one technocrat as they
[1:46:20.620 --> 1:46:25.060]  call themselves to launch it so I think it's important that the instinct of
[1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:29.740]  human survival takes control of the technocracy now to empower the free
[1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:35.460]  market empower the individual in the market of ideas through free will rather
[1:46:35.460 --> 1:46:38.580]  than let these monsters get the technocracy because they admit what
[1:46:38.580 --> 1:46:43.260]  you've said that history's against them but they believe that the holy grail of
[1:46:43.260 --> 1:46:47.540]  the sentient robot is going to save them they're quite delusional I believe as
[1:46:47.540 --> 1:46:51.500]  the web was meant to control us we're now using it to destroy them I believe
[1:46:51.500 --> 1:46:55.580]  they will fall into their own pit Lou Rockwell well I think it's true I
[1:46:55.580 --> 1:47:00.460]  wouldn't mind replacing Francois Hollande with a robot that would be that
[1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:04.100]  would be a step forward but you know these are these as you say the socialist
[1:47:04.100 --> 1:47:08.100]  they're fascists they don't actually understand anything about human
[1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:12.420]  productivity they're anti-human productivity and they may have pipe
[1:47:12.420 --> 1:47:15.860]  dreams about this kind of thing and you know I think it's always important
[1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:21.380]  remember nothing is beyond them I mean you know they would happily commit
[1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:24.300]  horrendous crimes against humanity if they thought it would do them good and
[1:47:24.300 --> 1:47:28.980]  they certainly have in the past so that's that's the way they are I don't
[1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:32.380]  think they can get away with this I don't think from an economic standpoint or a
[1:47:32.380 --> 1:47:37.420]  technological standpoint they can do it but again it requires us fighting them
[1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:41.700]  I don't mean I don't mean violently fighting them but fighting them with
[1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:46.620]  ideas telling people the truth about them they can't stand the truth I mean
[1:47:46.620 --> 1:47:50.420]  they're like the witch in the Wizard of Oz the truth is sprinkling water on them
[1:47:50.420 --> 1:47:55.420]  and they all they all go up they can all go up it's melting I'm melting great
[1:47:55.420 --> 1:47:58.340]  analogy let me ask you this Lou Rockwell in closing and we're so thankful your
[1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:01.900]  time I know you've been a very very busy guy and we're honored to have you here
[1:48:01.900 --> 1:48:06.500]  with us Lou Rockwell.com I now look at the body language of Obama the
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  Republican senators as well McCain Graham Mendes the Democrat and I've
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:16.180]  studied history I'm obsessed with it I've seen a lot of film reels and things
[1:48:16.180 --> 1:48:19.740]  I've never seen a more mentally ill looking bunch I think that's what
[1:48:19.740 --> 1:48:25.060]  concerns me most is they look like Hitler's high command and the film reels
[1:48:25.060 --> 1:48:29.020]  I've seen in the last six months of the war some of the last film reels they
[1:48:29.020 --> 1:48:33.420]  look very freaked out and haunted and I think the special interests like Nixon
[1:48:33.420 --> 1:48:36.580]  said there's so many special interests that aren't even connected they just
[1:48:36.580 --> 1:48:40.420]  know they get more money and power if they do a even though B leads to nuclear
[1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:45.940]  war but but but it's scary but also makes me feel really good to see that
[1:48:45.940 --> 1:48:49.260]  their morale is super low but do you agree that they look completely whacked
[1:48:49.260 --> 1:48:55.180]  out of their mind oh I think they are you know doing evil as a regular as your
[1:48:55.180 --> 1:49:00.340]  daily bread is not good for the human spirit I mean obviously that's correct
[1:49:00.340 --> 1:49:04.900]  we know that from religion and and from history it's just it's not good for
[1:49:04.900 --> 1:49:08.380]  people it's not good for people to kill other people so these guys have all been
[1:49:08.380 --> 1:49:13.420]  killing people all their lives both in the military and probably otherwise as
[1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:18.460]  well so yeah they're sick and they also would like to be getting hosannas rather
[1:49:18.460 --> 1:49:22.900]  than getting the raspberry at their town hall meetings they can't stand it they
[1:49:22.900 --> 1:49:26.180]  feel themselves to be the greatest people in the history of the world and
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:30.260]  we all better obey them and when that doesn't happen they do begin indeed to
[1:49:30.260 --> 1:49:35.380]  crumble just like as you say Hitler in the bunker so let's hope we see more of
[1:49:35.380 --> 1:49:40.580]  that well what Putin who again I don't romanticize you're absolutely right but
[1:49:40.580 --> 1:49:45.580]  our our leaders are so evil he looks good and when comparison it's like jumping
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:51.300]  into a latrine that's only half full rather than overflowing but you know he
[1:49:51.300 --> 1:49:54.740]  did the right thing saying you people running this are not invincible you're
[1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:58.340]  not exceptional except for being exceptionally evil stop thinking you're
[1:49:58.340 --> 1:50:03.460]  God he is saying the emperors butt naked he is saying you're a fraud he's saying
[1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:06.900]  you're not invincible that's exactly what they need to be hearing before they
[1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:10.580]  blow the planet up and he's actually speaking for the people of the world I
[1:50:10.580 --> 1:50:14.700]  mean just like the government needs consent here at home at least tacit
[1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:18.540]  consent from the American people to do their evil so they need consent from the
[1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:23.340]  world in order to have their empire but the world is withdraw just as Americans
[1:50:23.340 --> 1:50:27.020]  withdraw on their consent the world is withdrawing its consent whether it's
[1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:33.260]  Brazil or Russia or India or China and all sorts of small countries too of
[1:50:33.260 --> 1:50:37.420]  course are not wanting to be ruled by the US they don't want to be invaded they
[1:50:37.420 --> 1:50:40.740]  don't want to be final question how long how long is the empire having your
[1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:47.620]  gutly Rockwell well I think it all depends at bottom on the dollar if I
[1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:51.260]  had to take a guess I would say it's got between five and ten years let's stay
[1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:55.300]  there let's let's do a final segment with you and then I promise Julio

[1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:56.740]  want to ask you about I mean I agree five ten years empires can go on a long
[1:55:56.740 --> 1:56:01.620]  time they've got nuclear weapons but at the same time if there's a complete loss
[1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:05.660]  of confidence you could have them fall like Chalcescu but then you're gonna
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:08.500]  have all the other collectivist and the hundreds of millions that are
[1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:12.980]  domesticated flooding back in not knowing what to do so as Ron Paul said
[1:56:12.980 --> 1:56:17.460]  it's gonna be a process what is your advice on the times we're going into
[1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:23.500]  right now and how we can have a peaceful end to the kleptocratic empire well I
[1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:29.060]  think we have to first of all set an example weapons killing poison gas
[1:56:29.060 --> 1:56:33.180]  atomic weapons a depleted uranium all the rest you know starvation sanctions
[1:56:33.180 --> 1:56:36.420]  all the rest of that stuff that's the those are the tools of the bad guys
[1:56:36.420 --> 1:56:41.460]  those are not our tools we're not violent we believe in peace we believe in
[1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:45.860]  peace in personal senses as well as international Ron Paul always says the
[1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:50.380]  golden rule foreign policy and the golden rule in our interpersonal
[1:56:50.380 --> 1:56:54.660]  relations so I think that's the most important thing second most important
[1:56:54.660 --> 1:56:58.180]  thing is to learn about some economics and history and learn what the heck is
[1:56:58.180 --> 1:57:02.700]  going on I think it's a great idea to have some gold I think it's a great
[1:57:02.700 --> 1:57:06.540]  idea to have some food I think it's a great idea to just be prepared for
[1:57:06.540 --> 1:57:13.180]  anything but you have the most important thing is be a beacon for your
[1:57:13.180 --> 1:57:19.860]  fellow men shine forth with the ideas of freedom and and and liberty and all
[1:57:19.860 --> 1:57:23.620]  the things that have been great about America now being crushed those ideas
[1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:27.940]  still exist even if they're somewhat underground we can fly that flag we can
[1:57:27.940 --> 1:57:32.700]  talk about those ideas we can read those books we can educate our children take
[1:57:32.700 --> 1:57:36.580]  them out of the public schools homeschool them many many things that we
[1:57:36.580 --> 1:57:40.620]  can do as individuals get out of debt to the extent you can we have to make a
[1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:45.300]  total break with the kleptocratic crony capitalist anti-free market system
[1:57:45.300 --> 1:57:49.340]  well they're the enemy and so they only want to crush us they want to be a ball
[1:57:49.340 --> 1:57:53.420]  and chain around our leg we don't want that so we should go in the opposite
[1:57:53.420 --> 1:57:57.580]  direction from those people and I think they're going to be some very exciting
[1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:01.140]  times ahead the people will be telling about telling their grandchildren and
[1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:04.780]  their great-grandchildren about what's going to be happening now and it's going
[1:58:04.780 --> 1:58:08.820]  to be very exciting I don't say that it's easy it's going to be maybe horrible
[1:58:08.820 --> 1:58:14.700]  but I believe we will win by the way speaking of that the developments will
[1:58:14.700 --> 1:58:18.940]  lead probably to a recall of John McCain it's begun Breitbart reporting official
[1:58:18.940 --> 1:58:23.980]  Arizona GOP body passes formal rebuke of John McCain says he's abandoned the
[1:58:23.980 --> 1:58:28.340]  GOP principles so it looks like the GOP might be trying to find their original
[1:58:28.340 --> 1:58:31.860]  principles right there Lou well I've looked to see McCain gone I don't know
[1:58:31.860 --> 1:58:35.700]  what the GOP principles are seems to me ever since Lincoln they've been pretty
[1:58:35.700 --> 1:58:40.460]  bad but McCain out of what we definitely sent home thank you Lou Rockwell next

[2:00:51.060 --> 2:00:56.020]  the Chicago Council on Global Affairs which is the Council on Foreign
[2:00:56.020 --> 2:01:00.180]  Relations his sister group are their little minion group but Monday morning

[2:01:06.580 --> 2:01:10.980]  do whatever they you know peacefully want to mr. Graham I highly suggest
[2:01:10.980 --> 2:01:14.980]  going to see him at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs I think Ms. Graham
[2:01:14.980 --> 2:01:20.260]  ought to marry mr. Maddow I'm sorry go ahead well they can do it at
[2:01:20.260 --> 2:01:25.500]  Boys Town in Chicago quickly Alex a couple of points number one executive
[2:01:25.500 --> 2:01:33.220]  order 13650 a new executive order that are lovely Presidente Barry
[2:01:33.220 --> 2:01:39.860]  Catoro signed a couple of weeks ago improving chemical facility and safety
[2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:44.260]  and security is the name of the executive order and basically all chemical
[2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:49.260]  plants nuclear plants in the United States are now under government and
[2:01:49.260 --> 2:01:54.660]  under the guidance of Homeland Security oh no no Homeland Security is seizing
[2:01:54.660 --> 2:02:00.900]  everything they're telling concert venues that you can't operate unless you
[2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:04.940]  grab everybody's genitals so I can't go to concerts because now where you go
[2:02:04.940 --> 2:02:09.780]  they literally grab your genitals at the new American handshake should be that
[2:02:09.780 --> 2:02:13.220]  you should wear your genitals on the outside to show you're not a terrorist
[2:02:13.220 --> 2:02:16.940]  instead of like like in the old days and then you would hold your hands up and
[2:02:16.940 --> 2:02:20.580]  wave a show I don't have weapons I'm a friend you know at 200 yards away and
[2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:24.460]  then you would shake hands to show you were a friend in the new America you
[2:02:24.460 --> 2:02:28.820]  present your I'm sorry but it's actually probably gonna be the new truth you
[2:02:28.820 --> 2:02:33.100]  will actually you will get over the hood of the car for a proctology exam by the
[2:02:33.100 --> 2:02:36.980]  officer so I think it's a great idea what do you think
[2:02:36.980 --> 2:02:43.260]  Lindsey Graham could train the police I think so I think so and another thing
[2:02:43.260 --> 2:02:48.700]  quickly Alex the US versus a show car I saw this on krypton.org a couple of
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:54.700]  weeks ago but our lovely United States government has assisted a motion for a
[2:02:54.700 --> 2:02:59.940]  protective order so basically all information regarding the trial is under
[2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:04.720]  protective order so oh yeah no no no they declared national security on this
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:09.340]  trial so you so he doesn't go up and say I'm innocent that was CIA they I mean
[2:03:09.340 --> 2:03:12.400]  he's already saying that so they can't let that come out because they did the
[2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:15.540]  bombing it all blow up in their face imagine how mad they are at us that's
[2:03:15.540 --> 2:03:19.220]  really our big coup this year was covering that breaking it and badandi and
[2:03:19.220 --> 2:03:22.980]  all the rest of it that's like risking our lives I don't like doing stuff like
[2:03:22.980 --> 2:03:27.620]  that it's really pushing it but hey say lovey somebody's got to do it and boy
[2:03:27.620 --> 2:03:33.500]  by ours to Alex maybe if we keep doing this boy by ours to Valhalla the Valkyrie
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:36.660]  is gonna take me up there I don't know so they got deserve it when they come
[2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:41.580]  after me but the point is is that all this is happening and it's incredibly
[2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:45.540]  historical and yeah I forgot national security on that national security on
[2:03:45.540 --> 2:03:50.340]  shooting their friend remember they ex effect will you print me that they've
[2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:57.300]  declared you know you'll made the the the FBI killing secret and declare
[2:03:57.300 --> 2:04:01.540]  national security because I mean that was in the news won't happen but a few

[2:10:01.300 --> 2:10:05.420]  first up before I get to my my point I just wanted to say thank you to you and
[2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:09.820]  your staff and whoever your source is down in Texas for leaking that
[2:10:09.820 --> 2:10:13.780]  information about the nuclear transfer I don't think people understand I mean
[2:10:13.780 --> 2:10:17.140]  that really might have saved millions of American lives that could have been
[2:10:17.140 --> 2:10:20.700]  their false flag for all we know so you guys are true patriots for doing that
[2:10:20.700 --> 2:10:26.500]  as we know since you study history as do I you know history repeats itself and
[2:10:26.500 --> 2:10:30.300]  what one thing we've noticed about all these false flag care events in our
[2:10:30.300 --> 2:10:33.060]  country is that there seems to be and you actually talked about this early on
[2:10:33.060 --> 2:10:36.540]  the broadcast there's always a drill taking place so I haven't heard you
[2:10:36.540 --> 2:10:39.340]  talk about this are you aware of the drill that the government is planning
[2:10:39.340 --> 2:10:43.300]  November 13th and 14th to shut down the entire power grid for two days and
[2:10:43.300 --> 2:10:48.220]  see what the response would be yes and I've told my crew to talk more about I
[2:10:48.220 --> 2:10:52.420]  think they're gonna selectively do it on the in FEMA region 3 but then we've
[2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:54.700]  learned there's other drills and they're doing basically a martial law
[2:10:54.700 --> 2:11:00.980]  federalization takeover drill with the Army riot police you name it all over
[2:11:00.980 --> 2:11:05.300]  the East Coast and and then also in West Virginia they've taken over for like
[2:11:05.300 --> 2:11:09.940]  six months schools roads for the Boy Scout national event but it's like a
[2:11:09.940 --> 2:11:15.460]  martial law drill that's what it is it's all acclimation to get the troops
[2:11:15.460 --> 2:11:19.580]  ready for this and and and yes it's a big deal people can type in the North
[2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:24.780]  American governments to run massive cyber attack drill in November and they've
[2:11:24.780 --> 2:11:28.900]  also got one coming up in October there's a whole bunch of drills it's
[2:11:28.900 --> 2:11:36.380]  grid x2 grid sec con update and it's on info wars calm drills are notable
[2:11:36.380 --> 2:11:40.340]  because they're the perfect cover for false flag ops but more than that it's
[2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:43.540]  a drill for total federalization so that Northcom can practice how to
[2:11:43.540 --> 2:11:46.580]  selectively shut off the power grids and get them back on because they're big
[2:11:46.580 --> 2:11:49.740]  dream and they've said this is real to shut your power off but then get it back
[2:11:49.740 --> 2:11:54.500]  up that's the big problem you think it'd be easy it takes decades of skill and
[2:11:54.500 --> 2:11:59.260]  things just to keep them up it's an art it's a science it's it's a mate most
[2:11:59.260 --> 2:12:04.580]  countries can't do it America and Switzerland and people and the French
[2:12:04.580 --> 2:12:07.980]  and others are real good at it taught the world how to do it and that's why
[2:12:07.980 --> 2:12:10.700]  most third world countries have plenty of power they just don't know how to
[2:12:10.700 --> 2:12:15.100]  run it because it's hard and they should do it pads of paper like the 40s and
[2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:19.460]  50s and 60s and stuff I mean it's genius level stuff it and it's an art form
[2:12:19.460 --> 2:12:24.140]  passed down by these people and the power companies keep saying we're trying to
[2:12:24.140 --> 2:12:28.460]  keep the power up but they keep shutting them all down and so they're this is
[2:12:28.460 --> 2:12:33.260]  mainly a drill testing martial law and testing the locals going under federal
[2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:37.940]  control and how to turn our power off go ahead well you've been asking your
[2:12:37.940 --> 2:12:41.260]  colors to come in and say what do you think the Empire strikes back would be
[2:12:41.260 --> 2:12:45.300]  for some reason I connected those shots it like that chill through my body just
[2:12:45.300 --> 2:12:49.340]  something something surreal about that whole thing and these people these
[2:12:49.340 --> 2:12:55.140]  kleptocratic psychopaths are so predictable now I mean it's it's so
[2:12:55.140 --> 2:12:58.420]  obvious now it's like a glass window like you said the curtain has been turned
[2:12:58.420 --> 2:13:01.140]  down it's burned to the ground we can all see the odd he's pranking the
[2:13:01.140 --> 2:13:05.580]  levers and I think that what we can do right now is at least start exposing
[2:13:05.580 --> 2:13:08.340]  things that they're going to do in the future because it is literally that easy
[2:13:08.340 --> 2:13:11.180]  to predict what these people are going to do that they have they are literally
[2:13:11.180 --> 2:13:16.580]  running rogue right now Alex and you know it yeah I do and then I'm really
[2:13:16.580 --> 2:13:22.180]  freaked out because I've talked to so many high-powered people that the
[2:13:22.180 --> 2:13:26.620]  establishment really is watching our show and I'm where I already know that
[2:13:26.620 --> 2:13:30.460]  but it's like creepy I mean it's just hope folks pray for us I mean this is the
[2:13:30.460 --> 2:13:33.820]  opposite of an ego trip I'm up there going wow we're kind of like in Mordor
[2:13:33.820 --> 2:13:37.340]  with the ring trying to climb up the side of Mountain Doom here so we did
[2:13:37.340 --> 2:13:41.260]  everybody's help and support and spread the word about the broadcast and we
[2:13:41.260 --> 2:13:44.700]  need financial support because I'm maxed out trying to complete all these
[2:13:44.700 --> 2:13:48.140]  operations and I know I should focus mainly on my radio show and I am but
[2:13:48.140 --> 2:13:51.460]  also kind of instinctively want to build up a larger infrastructure that
[2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:55.820]  understands this info so no matter what happens to me I can go forward all right
[2:13:55.820 --> 2:14:00.660]  thank you so much God bless you Owen I tell you these are the times that really
[2:14:00.660 --> 2:14:05.060]  are exciting in a frightening way but also an exhilarating way no one should
[2:14:05.060 --> 2:14:09.140]  be bored right now I'll tell you that right now you're bored if you're focused
[2:14:09.140 --> 2:14:15.180]  on NFL and acting cool and you know your wife's focused on I don't know what I
[2:14:15.180 --> 2:14:18.700]  mean it's we should be focused on trying to survive as a civilization and move
[2:14:18.700 --> 2:14:23.220]  forward President Bush thank you for holding that's what you say your name
[2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:25.980]  is and I'd be a conspiracy theorist if I question that you're supposed to
[2:14:25.980 --> 2:14:28.980]  mindlessly believe whatever you're told or your conspiracy theorists so I
[2:14:28.980 --> 2:14:34.260]  believe you are George Bush in fact especially Rachel Maddow told me so go
[2:14:34.260 --> 2:14:40.060]  ahead president well howdy there Alex I'm over here my fellow bonesmen in
[2:14:40.060 --> 2:14:45.060]  Cousins house John Kerry here in Boston Massachusetts and we are you know what we
[2:14:45.060 --> 2:14:50.780]  like to do and we like that well yeah yeah yeah I'm sorry go ahead yeah we
[2:14:50.780 --> 2:14:56.420]  just got done sacrifice and a go to help get this war in Syria started and of
[2:14:56.420 --> 2:14:59.460]  course when you say that I can't really do a good George Bush of course you say
[2:14:59.460 --> 2:15:03.100]  that kid kid has a double meaning I mean did you did you did you kill a four
[2:15:03.100 --> 2:15:07.760]  like a kid there are two like a kid well you know there's an old saying in
[2:15:07.760 --> 2:15:14.700]  Massachusetts you fool me once shame on you fool me twice you can't get fooled
[2:15:14.700 --> 2:15:23.140]  again yeah I hear you so you know we're really concerned over here and we're
[2:15:23.140 --> 2:15:26.900]  just trying to do what we can to get this war started and you know John Kerry
[2:15:26.900 --> 2:15:31.580]  he's doing the best he can but Obama he's just he just doesn't seem to have
[2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:37.660]  it in him John Kerry is liberal so anything he does is all right how dare
[2:15:37.660 --> 2:15:43.220]  you talk about about him what's the big deal what's the big deal but I'm the
[2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:47.540]  opposite and we're talking about here he is you know you're right George Bush
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:52.100]  George W. Bush is cousins with John Kerry and with Obama and with Dick Cheney
[2:15:52.100 --> 2:15:57.900]  and they do stand in a giant vat of feces I'm not gonna say it on air we have
[2:15:57.900 --> 2:16:03.060]  children listening but it's very it's very trendy I mean you know LA thinks
[2:16:03.060 --> 2:16:06.220]  they just invented all this I mean other the Germanic death cults had it
[2:16:06.220 --> 2:16:10.340]  figured out a while ago because if you'll do this when you're you know 20
[2:16:10.340 --> 2:16:15.620]  years old you'll do anything we tell you okay now you've bathed in this now you
[2:16:15.620 --> 2:16:19.140]  will be willing to start doing really hardcore stuff it's kind of a gang
[2:16:19.140 --> 2:16:23.060]  initiation thank you for the call extremist let's go ahead and talk to
[2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:32.620]  Christian in Nevada go ahead Christian I'm sorry my eyes must be getting bad
[2:16:32.620 --> 2:16:40.780]  it's across the room and I'm it is Kristen I apologize Kristen okay so
[2:16:40.780 --> 2:16:45.780]  today I was catching up on your show from yesterday and you had talked about
[2:16:45.780 --> 2:16:51.340]  the story about the hooker and like you got all beaten up and hit by a car or
[2:16:51.340 --> 2:16:56.540]  whatever it was and you're basically like saying how basically America wants
[2:16:56.540 --> 2:17:00.940]  to like keep people down and dependent on them well the criminals that run
[2:17:00.940 --> 2:17:05.500]  America do they want to break our will everything they do is about training us
[2:17:05.500 --> 2:17:11.140]  we have no dignity we have no rights yes they're running pimp game on us yeah
[2:17:11.140 --> 2:17:17.340]  and unfortunately I was brainwashed to be like a liberal for you know growing up
[2:17:17.340 --> 2:17:25.660]  that's all you get oh good yeah but I'm a sale parent I work two jobs and my
[2:17:25.660 --> 2:17:30.140]  parents I call them libtards but they're always like trying to get me to get on
[2:17:30.140 --> 2:17:35.140]  section 8 and get on booze dance and all this and I don't because they make it
[2:17:35.140 --> 2:17:40.820]  pretty much impossible for you to not do that by yourself and I would suggest
[2:17:40.820 --> 2:17:44.540]  going to church and finding a good hard-working man who wants a good woman
[2:17:44.540 --> 2:17:47.980]  and wants to help take care of her kid there are a lot of good men out there
[2:17:47.980 --> 2:17:51.580]  who actually want to take care of a woman who already has children I mean you
[2:17:51.580 --> 2:17:56.980]  could probably go find a good loving man there are some left in this country
[2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:01.220]  in Las Vegas but I actually I just got my daughter in the Catholic school which
[2:18:01.220 --> 2:18:06.140]  is you know another whole thing in itself but it was a huge fight because I
[2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:10.460]  don't get her vaccinated and it was like another huge deal with that and see but
[2:18:10.460 --> 2:18:14.620]  see as more of us say no it makes it easier by law there's the waiver and
[2:18:14.620 --> 2:18:18.860]  you just show them the literature and you help them and and and that's a good
[2:18:18.860 --> 2:18:25.180]  thing you did yeah and I just I admire you so much and I started listening to
[2:18:25.180 --> 2:18:30.140]  about 60 years ago and you kind of just like open my eyes and like when I was
[2:18:30.140 --> 2:18:34.300]  going to college and trying to get back but it's a little hard right now but I
[2:18:34.300 --> 2:18:39.220]  had done a report in my political science class about the Federal Reserve and I
[2:18:39.220 --> 2:18:45.500]  based a lot of it off of in the Fed by Ron Paul and my professor was a Democrat
[2:18:45.500 --> 2:18:51.700]  and he worked on Harry Reid's campaign and so I gave my report to the class and
[2:18:51.700 --> 2:18:55.860]  he basically tried to tell me that it was all false and like the Federal
[2:18:55.860 --> 2:19:00.660]  Reserve is not a private bank and like all this stuff and it's just like it's
[2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:06.260]  sad that you know our kids have to grow up thinking that well you're right but
[2:19:06.260 --> 2:19:12.100]  here's the great news Kristen that doesn't work anymore when they say oh
[2:19:12.100 --> 2:19:17.260]  the Federal Reserve is not private oh there's no mercury in the shot oh there's
[2:19:17.260 --> 2:19:21.740]  no problem it doesn't work anymore so don't feel bad when they strike back
[2:19:21.740 --> 2:19:24.740]  against you with what they've been told makes them part of the winning team
[2:19:24.740 --> 2:19:29.820]  they're part of the losing team they're part of the ignorant follower team and
[2:19:29.820 --> 2:19:35.660]  and even though you're struggling and poor you you have honor and dignity that
[2:19:35.660 --> 2:19:39.660]  is so beautiful and you have the seat of the universe in you as Mahatma Gandhi
[2:19:39.660 --> 2:19:43.180]  said and that's all that matters and you're a loving mother taking care of
[2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:48.140]  your child and you are the purest thing in this world so don't ever forget that
[2:19:48.140 --> 2:19:52.460]  your your God's greatest creation is a is a woman and her child and you should
[2:19:52.460 --> 2:19:56.980]  be absolutely just feeling so good about what you're doing and these fights
[2:19:56.980 --> 2:20:03.420]  you're winning God is gonna help you more it's hurricane and wildfire season

[2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:35.940]  surviving brother has pled not guilty and they declared national security on
[2:24:35.940 --> 2:24:40.380]  the case meaning no news of what's going on in the court can come out secret
[2:24:40.380 --> 2:24:46.740]  courts because we already know his brother was working for the CIA and a CIA
[2:24:46.740 --> 2:24:51.740]  program this came out mainstream news in Europe as part of the program run out
[2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:56.660]  of Georgetown University and controlled by Zabignan Brzezinski they were
[2:24:56.660 --> 2:25:00.020]  clearly part of a drill and set up we know that drill happened that a drill
[2:25:00.020 --> 2:25:04.620]  yesterday blowing something up on a tarmac to scare the public they could
[2:25:04.620 --> 2:25:08.420]  have said that was real and set up some guys part of a drill this is very
[2:25:08.420 --> 2:25:13.100]  dangerous folks and you notice the media says that
[2:25:13.100 --> 2:25:19.460]  Zohar and Tamerlan are the bombers even though they scream to the police we
[2:25:19.460 --> 2:25:23.420]  didn't do it don't shoot even though it turns out they didn't kill the cops and
[2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:29.700]  then their friend just to someone they they knew a bit the FBI came and shot
[2:25:29.700 --> 2:25:35.060]  him in the back of the head and then got caught lying about it and we have his
[2:25:35.060 --> 2:25:41.940]  wife we're also later going to try to get some of his family on Renny Todeshev
[2:25:41.940 --> 2:25:48.780]  and they've got a a operation they're running to try to get justice for him
[2:25:48.780 --> 2:25:52.180]  and I'm gonna tell everybody something the Supreme Court is hearing about the
[2:25:52.180 --> 2:25:56.460]  NDAA right now and how they want to secretly disappear us secretly kill us
[2:25:56.460 --> 2:26:01.420]  secretly torture us and they've declared national security on his autopsy and
[2:26:01.420 --> 2:26:05.140]  what the FBI did and the FBI admitted it turned out he didn't resist them he
[2:26:05.140 --> 2:26:10.340]  didn't hurt them and it looks like an execution a death squad and I know I
[2:26:10.340 --> 2:26:16.500]  hate to talk like that with this this widow here on the line with us Mrs.
[2:26:16.500 --> 2:26:20.260]  Todeshev thank you so much for having the courage to come on with us I want to
[2:26:20.260 --> 2:26:23.700]  this is a short segment long segment coming up on give me the floor now tell
[2:26:23.700 --> 2:26:27.460]  us what happened what's developed since then and from the any information you
[2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:32.380]  have why they wanted to him dead
[2:26:32.980 --> 2:26:41.100]  hi how are you I'm glad to speak with you and speak on the show there is
[2:26:41.100 --> 2:26:45.340]  never really not much stuff that we know since they haven't responded to us they
[2:26:45.340 --> 2:26:50.820]  haven't brought their own statements or anything they just pretty much only out
[2:26:50.820 --> 2:26:54.340]  of the press we know some statements that they have been bringing up but
[2:26:54.340 --> 2:26:57.900]  there is nothing much going on from them and I responded to us they're not
[2:26:57.900 --> 2:27:02.580]  talking to us that do not want to bring anything up and so now lawsuits are
[2:27:02.580 --> 2:27:06.860]  being filed I mean tell us tell us about the move to get justice for your
[2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:16.540]  executed husband yes skype skype dropped it was working great till we went to her
[2:27:16.540 --> 2:27:20.740]  will you haven't given us the autopsy report once again we can't do much stuff
[2:27:20.740 --> 2:27:26.420]  without us yes so we we don't really have so many official papers of what
[2:27:26.420 --> 2:27:29.540]  really happened in there so there's not much we can do before we do our
[2:27:29.540 --> 2:27:33.500]  independent investigation which is we are doing right now and there's a lot of
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:38.700]  persecutor from Florida who wants things to investigate the case and those
[2:27:38.700 --> 2:27:43.100]  people are who are helping us to get justice for him how do people find out
[2:27:43.100 --> 2:27:47.020]  more about justice for your husband because again if they can execute him
[2:27:47.020 --> 2:27:52.980]  they can execute anybody I'm sure they can and that's what we're trying to get
[2:27:52.980 --> 2:27:58.660]  to people that he was killed unfairly it was just they came to our home and they
[2:27:58.660 --> 2:28:02.540]  just had he shot him there and that's we're trying to get to people that this
[2:28:02.540 --> 2:28:08.180]  is wrong this is cannot be happening anymore and there's we just I don't
[2:28:08.180 --> 2:28:12.900]  even know how we we're gonna get the justice but we gonna fight for it it's
[2:28:12.900 --> 2:28:18.500]  gonna be hard case we're gonna be fighting with the FBI people can follow
[2:28:18.500 --> 2:28:23.980]  it at Twitter if they need to and one too it's very important or on Facebook
[2:28:23.980 --> 2:28:31.100]  it's at Russian underscore Miami one and also tell us the best place to visit on
[2:28:31.100 --> 2:28:37.500]  Facebook we I don't know that the Russian Facebook what were you exactly

[2:28:51.580 --> 2:28:56.500]  have and that's where I am on and that's when we got on screen justice for
[2:28:56.500 --> 2:29:02.860]  Ibrahim Tadashev correct correct that's right all right now now we this is
[2:29:02.860 --> 2:29:06.060]  short say we're coming back in a moment but I want to get specifically in it for

[2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:13.260]  injured then they admitted they weren't hurt then it was he was in a chair and
[2:29:13.260 --> 2:29:17.100]  they shot him in the back of the head and they're not gonna discuss it from
[2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:21.540]  what I know about their tactics and they have hit teams in the FBI he was
[2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:26.580]  scared he said they're coming to kill me I want to talk about as best you know
[2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:30.340]  from what was first reported in the different stories the FBI told and why

[2:33:44.220 --> 2:33:49.460]  talk to him he said they're coming to kill me the press reported and then
[2:33:49.460 --> 2:34:01.900]  suddenly he was dead to killed execution style in May 22nd of 2013 they
[2:34:01.900 --> 2:34:07.020]  arrived at his apartment in Orlando Florida interviewed him for eight hours
[2:34:07.020 --> 2:34:12.180]  in the living room that's that's let me tell you what that is and I hate to talk
[2:34:12.180 --> 2:34:15.420]  about this because this this this nice lady so she doesn't know what happened I
[2:34:15.420 --> 2:34:23.340]  know the standard procedure you know what eight hours means right they got the
[2:34:23.340 --> 2:34:29.180]  info they wanted and they executed him my my opinion from past operations
[2:34:29.180 --> 2:34:33.420]  studying these people is this has the hallmarks of someone tortured and then
[2:34:33.420 --> 2:34:41.580]  executed they would have kept torturing him and then executed him Terrence
[2:34:41.580 --> 2:34:45.380]  Yakey was tortured it appeared for more than five hours made the police have
[2:34:45.380 --> 2:34:47.860]  interviewed he was tortured all over his body before they shot him in the back
[2:34:47.860 --> 2:34:53.180]  of the head same execution style he of course knew who the feds were that bombed
[2:34:53.180 --> 2:34:58.860]  Oklahoma City false flags they do not play games folks and undoubtedly it did
[2:34:58.860 --> 2:35:07.100]  leak that Tamerlin was working in a CIA program to radicalize Mujahideen to
[2:35:07.100 --> 2:35:11.260]  attack Russia he was part of a program that's been connected to that that came
[2:35:11.260 --> 2:35:16.540]  out in the mainstream news it's not in the US you can look that up we wrote
[2:35:16.540 --> 2:35:20.940]  about articles pointed to the German and French and Russian news about it that's
[2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:24.140]  what the Russians had blown his cover his fake name and said who is this guy you
[2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:26.820]  allowed to fly in and out with a fake name he works for you daddy and they're
[2:35:26.820 --> 2:35:30.740]  like oh then the FBI lied so that they didn't know him these were guys were
[2:35:30.740 --> 2:35:35.540]  playboys out partying clearly weren't even Muslims just like Muhammad Atta at
[2:35:35.540 --> 2:35:41.620]  the topless bars every night they had a lot of money and her husband reportedly
[2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:46.300]  lifted weights with them and and they seemed to believe that he had been given
[2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:50.020]  the intel of their real identities well we already know those are blown the
[2:35:50.020 --> 2:35:55.780]  older brother was definitely CIA asset and got set up people that are being
[2:35:55.780 --> 2:35:58.740]  recruited this need to understand especially Muslims they've done this a
[2:35:58.740 --> 2:36:04.020]  lot where they set you up so look out of 7 7 was the same deal in London we
[2:36:04.020 --> 2:36:07.140]  proved those guys were were patsies it was part of a drill they put real bombs
[2:36:07.140 --> 2:36:10.300]  on and blew it up some of them escaped figured it out they machine gun them in
[2:36:10.300 --> 2:36:14.860]  the street declared national security a canary wharf I'm gonna be quiet now it's
[2:36:14.860 --> 2:36:17.820]  so hard to give out this info while I know that Renny Toteshev is when I was
[2:36:17.820 --> 2:36:21.260]  here we're gonna talk about justice for your husband you heard me just lay out
[2:36:21.260 --> 2:36:25.820]  what the circumstances point at it's pretty much cut and dry from my research
[2:36:25.820 --> 2:36:29.340]  from what I know how these operations work I'm not saying these men did this
[2:36:29.340 --> 2:36:33.460]  that's what it points that we know they shot him in the back of the head tell us
[2:36:33.460 --> 2:36:37.860]  what the family thinks and what your how well your husband really knew them
[2:36:37.860 --> 2:36:40.940]  because they don't they want a media blackout on this because all these facts
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:44.900]  for investigators out there and myself and others need this the prosecutor
[2:36:44.900 --> 2:36:48.260]  that's looking into this in Florida what is he asking you he'll have important
[2:36:48.260 --> 2:36:51.980]  questions on his trail so just even though info may not mean anything to you
[2:36:51.980 --> 2:36:56.340]  ma'am you heard what I just said it was reported he said they're coming to get
[2:36:56.340 --> 2:36:59.540]  me they're gonna kill me and people said oh you'll be fine just get out of the
[2:36:59.540 --> 2:37:03.940]  hell you know just wait for him is was that accurate the media where were you
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:07.500]  when this happened tell us the whole story
[2:37:09.980 --> 2:37:15.980]  um that night I was actually in Atlanta Georgia was about seven hours away from
[2:37:15.980 --> 2:37:21.900]  there wasn't work when it happened and this is not what exactly he said he he
[2:37:21.900 --> 2:37:26.300]  felt strange about it he's said this is not the first interview that was coming
[2:37:26.300 --> 2:37:29.020]  over and they called him they told him that's gonna be the sister of his last
[2:37:29.020 --> 2:37:33.100]  interview the agents from Boston they come in to speak with him and he said
[2:37:33.100 --> 2:37:36.220]  you guys I'm just tired of coming to your office you want to speak with me you
[2:37:36.220 --> 2:37:40.700]  can come to my house and he said that if anything happens to me just say say
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:44.700]  don't don't be quiet just say what happened to me if anything happens he
[2:37:44.700 --> 2:37:48.220]  wasn't scared if he would he probably would not want to speak with them at the
[2:37:48.220 --> 2:37:52.980]  first place but since he invited him to our home that means he wasn't
[2:37:52.980 --> 2:37:59.540]  scared of them and they have interviewed him he would not respond
[2:37:59.540 --> 2:38:04.540]  himself on or anything and they have his friend waiting him outside but
[2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:10.220]  suddenly they let him go after four hours and some of the agents still were
[2:38:10.220 --> 2:38:15.140]  still with the Ibrahim and as right now they've been pulling so many statements
[2:38:15.140 --> 2:38:20.660]  that he was armed and he was unarmed and that he was his body was a weapon so
[2:38:20.660 --> 2:38:26.980]  he's an MMA fighter but he just had his knee surgery back in March he wasn't
[2:38:26.980 --> 2:38:33.420]  able to move pretty quick pretty fast or do anything and after we actually after
[2:38:33.420 --> 2:38:39.420]  already all that happened we when we was able to enter the house he had seven
[2:38:39.420 --> 2:38:45.500]  shots one was in the back of the head and it has nothing to do with him start
[2:38:45.500 --> 2:38:49.140]  attacking them as they said they're coming with the knife with the blade
[2:38:49.140 --> 2:38:55.180]  with the broom with the swords I think they came with the five different
[2:38:55.180 --> 2:38:59.340]  statements for those that don't know it's important you say that they've now
[2:38:59.340 --> 2:39:03.820]  admitted that he didn't have a weapon didn't attack them at first we've been
[2:39:03.820 --> 2:39:06.900]  showing the headlines while you've been speaking that's why they've had what
[2:39:06.900 --> 2:39:10.860]  five different stories so now they just declare national security keep keep
[2:39:10.860 --> 2:39:18.460]  going through it so yeah um he was shot on the floor he got there is no shots in
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:22.900]  the walls or anything the bullet did not touch the wall
[2:39:27.020 --> 2:39:31.460]  ma'am your skype's breaking up that please just hold a minute one day we do
[2:39:31.460 --> 2:39:36.020]  not know how many just ma'am let me stop you start over with him on the floor
[2:39:36.020 --> 2:39:39.780]  being and this is admitted killed execution style they was done with
[2:39:39.780 --> 2:39:46.180]  precision of seven shots go through that again so your testimonies on record
[2:39:46.180 --> 2:39:51.580]  your skype broke up so he was definitely on the floor because there is no
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:58.420]  blood sparring on the wall there is no bullets on the wall and he got seven
[2:39:58.420 --> 2:40:03.900]  shots but he does has about 11 holes on his body which is means some of the
[2:40:03.900 --> 2:40:08.540]  bullets went through and which is means those bulls has to be somewhere in the
[2:40:08.540 --> 2:40:11.820]  wall if he was standing up if they were trying to say that he was attacking
[2:40:11.820 --> 2:40:18.460]  them but none of the bullets was anywhere but the floor most likely he was
[2:40:18.460 --> 2:40:25.380]  his face was down and he was shot near the entrance of the door I can only
[2:40:25.380 --> 2:40:30.380]  guess of what was happening either he was trying to get away from them or to
[2:40:30.380 --> 2:40:35.980]  run away or anything could happen in there and it's been almost four months
[2:40:35.980 --> 2:40:40.340]  they're not giving us anything in statements or anything they blocked the
[2:40:40.340 --> 2:40:45.300]  autopsy report and this is so weird to me and it should be questioned by people
[2:40:45.300 --> 2:40:50.140]  how come with the bombing situation after three days they have choose those
[2:40:50.140 --> 2:40:53.860]  people they choose Jahar and in Pamirland and say that they were the
[2:40:53.860 --> 2:40:59.140]  bomber but it's not enough for them four months to give us results to give us
[2:40:59.140 --> 2:41:04.060]  statements of what really happened those apartments it's just they not it's not
[2:41:04.060 --> 2:41:08.620]  not common sense to me it's so many things that they did wrong either it's
[2:41:08.620 --> 2:41:13.940]  just a cheap show from them they were trying to make a blower show out of it
[2:41:13.940 --> 2:41:21.820]  but I don't think they think that too deep for it to make a crack things so
[2:41:21.820 --> 2:41:27.100]  the people will not push sure the your sky broke up again what about these
[2:41:27.100 --> 2:41:32.500]  our Nev brothers themselves did you know them did you ever see you know
[2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:36.220]  anything that they had to say about what they were doing when they would visit
[2:41:36.220 --> 2:41:41.420]  the caucuses why Tamerlan had multiple names did they ever brag hey we're secret
[2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:46.180]  agents was there anything like that I never heard that I have heard before
[2:41:46.180 --> 2:41:50.660]  about Tamerlan when Ibrahim we used to live in Boston but we get married in
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:57.300]  2010 and in 2010 in September Ibrahim moved from Boston to Atlanta and he
[2:41:57.300 --> 2:42:02.380]  have not spoken with Tamerlan for so long maybe once in couple months as he
[2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:06.780]  just will call him and ask him how he's doing but they were never close friends
[2:42:06.780 --> 2:42:11.860]  or anything so it's accurate that they were just off and on friends lifting
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:17.820]  weights and stuff yes they were doing attention to the same gym in Boston
[2:42:17.820 --> 2:42:22.420]  because they were both boxers basically right correct they just they were all
[2:42:22.420 --> 2:42:26.340]  different type Tamerlan was a boxer my husband was the MMA fighter which is
[2:42:26.340 --> 2:42:33.300]  mixed martial arts sure so that's just a different type of fights sure I mean
[2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:37.460]  what does your gut tell you what does the family think of why they were there
[2:42:37.460 --> 2:42:41.220]  eight hours and then he's shot in the back of the head and then shot six other
[2:42:41.220 --> 2:42:46.980]  times on the floor I mean what do you guys think really happened in your gut
[2:42:46.980 --> 2:42:53.620]  the only guess we can have that they first of all they knew that they are
[2:42:53.620 --> 2:43:00.700]  going there to kill him and they probably have told them they have told
[2:43:00.700 --> 2:43:04.340]  Ibrahim of what they've done to Tamerlan what they've done to Jahar they
[2:43:04.340 --> 2:43:08.420]  probably told him that all this setup and either you're gonna admit that you
[2:43:08.420 --> 2:43:11.860]  were there or you were helping or whatever and my husband just said that
[2:43:11.860 --> 2:43:16.660]  I'm not gonna be signing anything and I'm not gonna be committed to anything that
[2:43:16.660 --> 2:43:21.980]  I haven't done since they were trying to probably just come come commit him to
[2:43:21.980 --> 2:43:28.140]  something to sign and he just said no so sign this or your brains your
[2:43:28.140 --> 2:43:31.420]  signature your brains will be on the contract I'm sorry to quote the godfather
[2:43:31.420 --> 2:43:37.180]  but but pretty much that probably what was going on in there so that's what
[2:43:37.180 --> 2:43:44.340]  you're all the evidence points towards what about the precedent everyone Ron
[2:43:44.340 --> 2:43:49.100]  Paul myself countless others said if we set up Homeland Security Patriot Act
[2:43:49.100 --> 2:43:52.820]  have an NDAA where they say they can kill citizens whenever they want they're
[2:43:52.820 --> 2:44:00.220]  going to start doing it and they're now disappearing citizens you name it they've
[2:44:00.220 --> 2:44:04.860]  got death squads that I know killed a CIA section chief in Houston a few years
[2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:09.020]  ago he gets out of his car they kill him even on chopper video he had no weapon
[2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:13.380]  I mean people need to understand we're getting to a point now where they have
[2:44:13.380 --> 2:44:17.500]  special unit killers on big police forces that work for the different
[2:44:17.500 --> 2:44:23.540]  agencies defense intelligence state department security services CIA NSA
[2:44:23.540 --> 2:44:28.780]  private corporations blackwater connected groups I mean I happen to know
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:35.340]  this for a fact I'm not naive because I had some family that was recruited out
[2:44:35.340 --> 2:44:39.340]  of the army to do things like this the point is and and it got so immoral
[2:44:39.340 --> 2:44:42.180]  refused to do it and got out of it so the big lies you will see you can't get
[2:44:42.180 --> 2:44:45.620]  out of it that's not true just America is so naive they don't know what's
[2:44:45.620 --> 2:44:50.340]  happening here I mean maybe five percent chance out of a hundred he said
[2:44:50.340 --> 2:44:53.660]  that's it I'm leaving get out of here and the FBI got mad and shot him and we
[2:44:53.660 --> 2:44:56.820]  see cops all the time now if you say no they just think they're allowed to kill
[2:44:56.820 --> 2:45:02.540]  you but just the whole way this looks in eight hours I think exactly what you're
[2:45:02.540 --> 2:45:08.100]  saying and what your family thinks that that that he was told you either sign
[2:45:08.100 --> 2:45:11.620]  this or that's the end of it and we know that's a classic confession technique
[2:45:11.620 --> 2:45:15.660]  the Austin police have been caught on video multiple times saying you'll sign
[2:45:15.660 --> 2:45:18.660]  this confession we're gonna blow your brains out that's how they got a
[2:45:18.660 --> 2:45:21.780]  confession on the yogurt shop murders because they wanted to cover up who
[2:45:21.780 --> 2:45:25.420]  really did that here in Austin but I'm kind of going off into inside baseball
[2:45:25.420 --> 2:45:32.420]  stuff other key points people should know about ma'am looks like the law
[2:45:32.420 --> 2:45:36.540]  enforcement being shot in so many people and they get in the way with it and
[2:45:36.540 --> 2:45:42.500]  people speak today just don't they should talk about law enforcement killing
[2:45:42.500 --> 2:45:49.780]  people who killing people with with no it just I don't know how to say that but
[2:45:49.780 --> 2:45:54.260]  they get in the way with so many things and in this case we're not gonna get a
[2:45:54.260 --> 2:45:57.980]  day not gonna get away with it because we are not gonna stop fighting for it
[2:45:57.980 --> 2:46:03.620]  we are gonna be keep fighting for it and people need to really look up for it and
[2:46:03.620 --> 2:46:09.500]  be more afraid of law law enforcement than to be afraid of mafia or anybody
[2:46:09.500 --> 2:46:14.580]  else even mafia get they get punishment for killing for that for the wrong death
[2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:20.540]  but law enforcement doesn't know you know the FBI in the last two years has
[2:46:20.540 --> 2:46:26.300]  killed 150 plus people in questionable circumstances and the FBI has ruled no
[2:46:26.300 --> 2:46:31.700]  fault in every case now does anyone believe they're 100% innocent I mean how
[2:46:31.700 --> 2:46:35.660]  naive I heard the Austin police chiefs say two weeks ago on the radio that
[2:46:35.660 --> 2:46:41.180]  there's not one bad cop in Austin and they're all good now that is just
[2:46:41.180 --> 2:46:47.580]  bullface bull and and and that's propaganda and when you start having
[2:46:47.580 --> 2:46:51.540]  government say we're 100% good you better start looking out that they're
[2:46:51.540 --> 2:47:07.020]  bad I'm completely agree with that those are most people who you need to be
[2:47:07.020 --> 2:47:10.860]  afraid of because if they're gonna kill you they're gonna get away with it they
[2:47:10.860 --> 2:47:14.020]  are just law enforcement the worst case scenario is gonna happen they're gonna
[2:47:14.020 --> 2:47:19.260]  get fired from their job and once again just to cover somebody who is up higher
[2:47:19.260 --> 2:47:24.900]  who is actually was working on that case because my husband get killed not from
[2:47:24.900 --> 2:47:29.500]  those people who actually kill him it has to be something higher up of them
[2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:33.540]  and what's gonna happen now they're gonna fire the person who killed him and
[2:47:33.540 --> 2:47:41.140]  that's it but to shut somebody seven times and say that this is was a self
[2:47:41.140 --> 2:47:46.420]  defense come on people you got to be kidding me and back and ahead this is
[2:47:46.420 --> 2:47:52.700]  just a straight execution style there is no way somebody would even plus if they
[2:47:52.700 --> 2:47:58.380]  said that he confessed he I'm assuming you need a live person you need to open
[2:47:58.380 --> 2:48:02.740]  that the murder of the son's day is signing him to a triple murder as well
[2:48:02.740 --> 2:48:07.900]  if he just signed a confession he confessed that he he was in that murder
[2:48:07.900 --> 2:48:12.100]  he killed somebody you need a live person and to stop a person even he being
[2:48:12.100 --> 2:48:17.740]  aggressive to you you can shot him once twice but not to kill him he got three
[2:48:17.740 --> 2:48:22.720]  shots in the heart and one in the liver one in the head so those five shots are
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:30.700]  straight death shots and two more that on his arm so and none of them were to
[2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:36.380]  stop him all the shots were to kill him only Imperial Stormtroopers are so
[2:48:36.380 --> 2:48:43.580]  precise this was done to execute him triple shot in the heart liver shot
[2:48:43.580 --> 2:48:50.300]  headshot absolutely trying to make sure your husband was dead I don't think they
[2:48:50.300 --> 2:48:54.860]  would do this unless unless they had NSA communicates which mean we know they
[2:48:54.860 --> 2:49:01.980]  have in that that one of the brothers are probably Tamerlin contacted him to
[2:49:01.980 --> 2:49:06.780]  tell him something or he was told something that they didn't want out
[2:49:06.780 --> 2:49:11.820]  there did your husband ever say anything to you about things like that no
[2:49:11.820 --> 2:49:19.300]  never you're in Moscow now why have you gone to Moscow do you not feel safe in
[2:49:19.300 --> 2:49:24.780]  the former United States sons I brought my husband's body with my father-in-law
[2:49:24.780 --> 2:49:28.980]  back here to bury him at home in Chechnya I haven't back went back to
[2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:34.500]  United States and that's exactly why I do not feel safe anymore there plus my
[2:49:34.500 --> 2:49:40.340]  mom being right now they have she's working for the US Army they have took
[2:49:40.340 --> 2:49:45.380]  her file files right now she's under investigation as well up from the FBI
[2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:50.220]  and for me to go back there I think that's probably another thing they want
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:55.460]  me to do to go back there and you never know next things you know that my plane
[2:49:55.460 --> 2:49:59.420]  where I was when I was flying it get crashed I get in a car accident or
[2:49:59.420 --> 2:50:03.380]  anything like that may happen as well that's why I do not want to go there I
[2:50:03.380 --> 2:50:07.620]  don't want to feel safe in there until they're gonna release statements of my
[2:50:07.620 --> 2:50:13.740]  husband death and tell us of what happened in there Wow we're gonna come
[2:50:13.740 --> 2:50:17.300]  back with a final segment with you you have a lot of courage obviously I want
[2:50:17.300 --> 2:50:20.420]  to ask you when we come back so think about this because lots going on I've

[2:50:31.740 --> 2:50:36.340]  know you've talked to some of the family as well when we come back I want to ask

[2:58:55.320 --> 2:58:59.220]  moved through history every great leader has had to understand the potential of
[2:58:59.220 --> 2:59:05.100]  information billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking
[2:59:05.100 --> 2:59:10.860]  at how to tap into your psyche from compulsory state education to the
[2:59:10.860 --> 2:59:15.660]  Hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the
[2:59:15.660 --> 2:59:19.660]  ideas that shape our actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop
[2:59:19.660 --> 2:59:23.500]  between you observing and testing it out and verifying if they can take total
[2:59:23.500 --> 2:59:27.220]  control of your awareness all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead
[2:59:27.220 --> 2:59:31.980]  of the game how to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would
[2:59:31.980 --> 2:59:41.460]  not only endorse but demand war because there's a war on for your mind get your
[2:59:41.460 --> 2:59:47.020]  copy of state of mind the movie at info wars dot com and remember every order at
[2:59:47.020 --> 2:59:51.580]  info wars store dot com receives a free citizen rulebook
[2:59:51.580 --> 2:59:58.380]  coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones broadcasting
[2:59:58.380 --> 3:00:01.580]  network network
[3:00:05.020 --> 3:00:12.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[3:00:12.820 --> 3:00:20.460]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[3:00:20.460 --> 3:00:28.700]  Alex Jones well we just hand to the wife of a man who was executed by the FBI at
[3:00:28.700 --> 3:00:32.860]  his house and I was reading the New York Times and Wall Street Journal today
[3:00:32.860 --> 3:00:37.220]  doing research to do this interview again refreshing my memory at the time it
[3:00:37.220 --> 3:00:41.340]  just clouds it with all the extra factoids over 150 people in very
[3:00:41.340 --> 3:00:45.300]  suspicious circumstances the last two years where the FBI is interrogating
[3:00:45.300 --> 3:00:50.260]  people they just kill you so I mean it's kind of getting to a point where if the
[3:00:50.260 --> 3:00:56.740]  FBI is coming interview you know it's like a death penalty like death squads
[3:00:56.740 --> 3:01:02.620]  and I guess our government's funded death squads worldwide against anybody that
[3:01:02.620 --> 3:01:05.780]  resists the Federal Reserve so why not I mean why not have death squads here
[3:01:05.780 --> 3:01:12.500]  that's what it is but I tell you you know historically and I don't have some
[3:01:12.500 --> 3:01:16.020]  macho deal where I want to see some civil war that's what we're trying to
[3:01:16.020 --> 3:01:21.300]  avert here but they'll get to a point where people that work for this corrupt
[3:01:21.300 --> 3:01:24.700]  federal government are need to understand that people that are doing this
[3:01:24.700 --> 3:01:28.020]  need to be brought to justice or collectively you'll be held accountable
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:33.380]  and it won't be like Oklahoma City where you guys blow up a daycare center you
[3:01:33.380 --> 3:01:37.540]  know to get everybody to feel sorry for you it's it's not gonna be like that it's
[3:01:37.540 --> 3:01:41.620]  just gonna be people will start realizing that they can't just bend over
[3:01:41.620 --> 3:01:47.620]  and let you shoot them in the back of the head like you did Gary Webb and so
[3:01:47.620 --> 3:01:52.100]  many others I mean or Terence Yakey cop of the year you tortured to death and
[3:01:52.100 --> 3:01:55.640]  murdered called his partner minutes before that he disappeared saying the
[3:01:55.640 --> 3:02:01.340]  feds are behind me and the word is that was FBI did that to him and I mean that's
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:06.420]  who they hired I mean that's who they get generally former special forces types
[3:02:06.420 --> 3:02:10.700]  they then put into the FBI it's not the lawyer types that run the FBI and then
[3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:14.740]  they they send them out and it's big deal don't take this cop torture him
[3:02:14.740 --> 3:02:18.020]  shoot him in the head that's what they do they think they're the winning team
[3:02:18.020 --> 3:02:21.060]  because they can just do that and just get away with it everybody's afraid well
[3:02:21.060 --> 3:02:24.300]  at a certain point we're not afraid anymore it's like okay whatever can only
[3:02:24.300 --> 3:02:27.980]  shoot me in the head once can only torture me for five hours like Terence
[3:02:27.980 --> 3:02:34.220]  Yakey wants after that you're still a sack of crap after that you're still sick
[3:02:34.220 --> 3:02:39.580]  after that you're still who you are it's not tough I'm so sick of these bully
[3:02:39.580 --> 3:02:45.940]  type people that like get off on scaring you get off on like trying to make you
[3:02:45.940 --> 3:02:51.420]  feel small I mean you know what the world is full of the bones of these
[3:02:51.420 --> 3:02:56.620]  empires and they all fail and when this one fails and it is failing and it's
[3:02:56.620 --> 3:03:03.260]  going to fail justice demands that you be dealt with I don't even have any
[3:03:03.260 --> 3:03:08.380]  vengeance where I I'm beyond even wanting to see these evil people suffer
[3:03:08.380 --> 3:03:14.500]  and no I know it has to be done for justice's sake because I realized how
[3:03:14.500 --> 3:03:18.980]  pathetic truly evil people are who get off on evil and get off on persecuting
[3:03:18.980 --> 3:03:23.980]  good people and innocence and who get off on playing God and who get off on
[3:03:23.980 --> 3:03:31.500]  being judge dread I know that you've got to face the Creator I know there's a
[3:03:31.500 --> 3:03:38.820]  spiritual realm mathematics and science shows it I know that you do what you do
[3:03:38.820 --> 3:03:45.220]  because you're weak I know and I am so sad for you that you're so cowardly that
[3:03:45.220 --> 3:03:48.980]  you try to act tough and powerful and try to be in big invincible gangs you
[3:03:48.980 --> 3:03:53.300]  think who go around abusing people by looking at all the angles to do it in
[3:03:53.300 --> 3:03:58.260]  the safest possible way you're the opposite of warriors you're the opposite
[3:03:58.260 --> 3:04:03.980]  of honorable a warrior takes on 10 to 1 a warrior wants to truly be challenged
[3:04:03.980 --> 3:04:08.180]  and fight evil a warrior wants to defend innocence and you people do the
[3:04:08.180 --> 3:04:12.100]  opposite you blow up federal buildings and you pick them because they got a
[3:04:12.100 --> 3:04:16.460]  daycare center in it so you can grandstand on TV and we know the names of
[3:04:16.460 --> 3:04:20.940]  the agents that did it you'd what hotels you checked into it's all public
[3:04:20.940 --> 3:04:26.220]  world net dailies info wars local TV in that area we all know your names and
[3:04:26.220 --> 3:04:30.540]  where you planted the bombs and what you did and let me tell you you're not
[3:04:30.540 --> 3:04:36.180]  gonna escape justice in this life of the next for all those kids you blew up or
[3:04:36.180 --> 3:04:42.740]  for the man you executed at his house for whatever reason you're not gonna get
[3:04:42.740 --> 3:04:46.980]  away with it you will be brought to justice and you know that and I know
[3:04:46.980 --> 3:04:51.260]  it ruins it for you that we're not afraid and don't care what happens all
[3:04:51.260 --> 3:04:56.020]  that matters is that you be brought to justice all that matters is that the new
[3:04:56.020 --> 3:05:01.740]  world order be brought down
