[00:00.000 --> 00:10.120]  It is Wednesday, May 20th, the year is 2020.
[00:10.120 --> 00:17.880]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we stand at the precipice of the end of humanity.
[00:17.880 --> 00:22.480]  Information we're about to cover in the next four hours is the most important information
[00:22.480 --> 00:28.680]  ever revealed on air in the history of human communications.
[00:28.680 --> 00:31.360]  That is not a joke.
[00:31.360 --> 00:39.080]  Engineer and researcher David Knight, coming up in 15 minutes, is going to be in studio
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.800]  several hours with Owen Schreuer, and we have investigative journalist John Rabaport
[00:42.800 --> 00:44.400]  joining us as well.
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.960]  Now, you know you get next year's news today here.
[00:47.960 --> 00:54.760]  You always think of aliens via Hollywood coming from far away star systems or coming
[00:54.760 --> 01:02.520]  from another dimension or coming out of a black hole, but what if humans made new life
[01:02.520 --> 01:05.640]  forms here on Earth that had never existed?
[01:05.640 --> 01:08.520]  Those would be by their definition alien.
[01:08.520 --> 01:15.280]  Now, this is hiding in plain view, and doing deep research on this, it hit me this morning
[01:15.280 --> 01:19.240]  about two hours ago what this really is and how to define it, and we'll put the article
[01:19.240 --> 01:25.560]  up on screen from m4wars.com, the live feed, world exclusive.
[01:25.560 --> 01:37.160]  There is a alien takeover via nanotech vaccines now happening on a planetary scale.
[01:37.160 --> 01:47.000]  Imagine if you are Bill Melinda Gates, the supposed computer geniuses that set a top
[01:47.000 --> 01:50.120]  Microsoft, it's really a global front group.
[01:50.120 --> 01:51.120]  What's the next frontier?
[01:51.120 --> 01:55.040]  They've told us it's humans merging with machines, oh, we're going to be cyborgs over
[01:55.040 --> 02:03.440]  and over forever, but really what's happening is these so-called mRNA vaccines go into every
[02:03.440 --> 02:11.720]  cell and reprogram the cell to produce a virus's protein to supposedly give you immunity instead
[02:11.720 --> 02:16.840]  of introducing a weakened virus or an attenuated virus to your body that it learns how to
[02:16.840 --> 02:17.840]  defeat.
[02:17.840 --> 02:20.680]  That still has autoimmune problems, other things, and they've been caught adding things,
[02:20.680 --> 02:24.200]  the vaccines that sterilize people, and all the history of secret experimentation.
[02:24.200 --> 02:25.360]  They just hope you forget all this.
[02:25.360 --> 02:28.840]  Well, Bill and Melinda Gates represent all that big money and the robber barons that
[02:28.840 --> 02:31.600]  Hitler was just a spin-off of.
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.560]  Mighty Oaks is Bill Gates's people.
[02:33.560 --> 02:34.560]  Hitler was a little side tree.
[02:34.560 --> 02:43.200]  They pruned the bad son, and now they have a whole class of vaccines that reprogram your
[02:43.200 --> 02:49.560]  brain, reprogram your cells, and overwrite your body, and researchers at Vanderbilt
[02:49.560 --> 02:53.600]  and others call just this one class of mRNA vaccines.
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.960]  They're rolling out worldwide against all of us saying we can't travel till we take
[02:56.960 --> 02:57.960]  these.
[02:57.960 --> 03:00.360]  Gates says this is the one he wants you to take.
[03:00.360 --> 03:07.880]  It goes into the cell and changes the cell itself, and then Gates lies and says, oh,
[03:07.880 --> 03:09.240]  but it doesn't change your genome.
[03:09.240 --> 03:11.160]  Yes, it does, and we have those studies.
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.720]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is overriding every cell in the body, just like the 1980s
[03:16.720 --> 03:17.960]  thing movie.
[03:17.960 --> 03:20.440]  That thing didn't want to be that dog.
[03:20.440 --> 03:24.560]  That thing wanted to be us, and it makes it a civilization.
[03:24.560 --> 03:29.000]  Within just 30-something days, there'll be no more original human life on earth because
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.080]  it's going to overwrite it and become all of it.
[03:31.080 --> 03:32.440]  That's a movie.
[03:32.440 --> 03:36.280]  This is the real thing.
[03:36.280 --> 03:37.280]  It's now.
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.280]  It's not coming later.
[03:38.280 --> 03:39.280]  It's now.
[03:39.280 --> 03:42.920]  And, of course, this first wave will be, oh, just rewrite yourselves to create proteins
[03:42.920 --> 03:45.720]  that quote, protect you, and then there'll be some side effects.
[03:45.720 --> 03:49.640]  This guy developing with Gates headed up the Gardasil and got that put out worldwide, even
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.400]  though it killed masses of people and sterilized women, eating their ovaries.
[03:53.400 --> 03:57.800]  So, it's all been a test to see what they get away with, and when they got away with
[03:57.800 --> 04:00.960]  sterilizing hundreds of millions of women, that's what's coming out now.
[04:00.960 --> 04:01.960]  They're sterile.
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.800]  But they're little girls, and later it turns out they can't have kids, most of them.
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.600]  Now, you see they're bringing you the next level.
[04:09.600 --> 04:16.600]  This is alien programming with lipids that are nanotech that carry the nanotech synthetics,
[04:16.600 --> 04:23.440]  as it right here, out of Bill Gates' mouth, synthetic nanotech lab-made virus that takes
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.040]  over your cells.
[04:25.040 --> 04:29.120]  It isn't putting in a virus for white blood cells to learn how to beat it, but to emphasize
[04:29.120 --> 04:30.720]  generals and then train everybody else.
[04:30.720 --> 04:31.720]  It's not that.
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.800]  This is overriding you just like that with the COVID freakout.
[04:35.800 --> 04:40.200]  The hysteria of every article, how great it is, turns out he's financing the PR, and
[04:40.200 --> 04:44.480]  it is literally the end of humanity, the overriding of humanity.
[04:44.480 --> 04:46.640]  And it's going to sound great.
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.240]  Oh, these go in and fix your eyesight.
[04:48.240 --> 04:49.480]  Oh, these go in and fix your brain.
[04:49.480 --> 04:50.480]  Oh, these make you...
[04:50.480 --> 04:51.720]  That's what they're saying.
[04:51.720 --> 04:55.040]  This is the next big tech takeover, the end of humanity.
[04:55.040 --> 05:02.040]  Stay with us.
[05:02.040 --> 05:04.680]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[05:04.680 --> 05:05.840]  in stock, like krill oil.
[05:05.840 --> 05:06.840]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[05:06.840 --> 05:09.400]  We don't have the benefits of krill oil.
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.400]  It's incredible.
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.120]  Everything in your body, for your heart, your skin, your libido, your stamina, your dreams,
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.560]  take one of these for you to sleep.
[05:15.560 --> 05:16.560]  It's well-known.
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.800]  Experience it for yourself.
[05:17.800 --> 05:18.800]  Infowarsstore.com.
[05:18.800 --> 05:20.560]  X2 sold out for much.
[05:20.560 --> 05:22.240]  Deep earth, pure crystal iodine.
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.440]  Back in stock, 50% off.
[05:23.440 --> 05:24.440]  Vaso beats.
[05:24.440 --> 05:25.440]  Back in stock, 50% off.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.440]  Vitamin refusion.
[05:26.440 --> 05:27.680]  Back in stock, 50% off.
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.600]  Real red pill, red pill plus with all the vitamins and minerals and the pregnant one
[05:30.600 --> 05:31.600]  known.
[05:31.600 --> 05:32.600]  That's close to selling out.
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.520]  Both formulas were really close to selling out real red pill plus.
[05:34.520 --> 05:36.600]  Just got some stimulant and an actual caffeine.
[05:36.600 --> 05:37.600]  That's close to selling out.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.600]  50% off still.
[05:38.600 --> 05:39.600]  Infowarsstore.com.
[05:39.600 --> 05:43.640]  And we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying, we may not take
[05:43.640 --> 05:44.640]  orders in a few months.
[05:44.640 --> 05:47.000]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.040]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[05:49.040 --> 05:50.600]  This is total depression.
[05:50.600 --> 05:52.320]  The infrastructure is going down.
[05:52.320 --> 06:08.800]  Get the products while you still can.
[06:08.800 --> 06:12.560]  Arthur C. Clarke was at the highest levels of the true Illuminati.
[06:12.560 --> 06:18.080]  He was the inventor of the telecommunication satellite, not just a best-selling author.
[06:18.080 --> 06:28.200]  But the first big book that he put out in coordination with EOSS was Childhood's End.
[06:28.200 --> 06:33.400]  The aliens come and they give us technology to fix broken backs and let the blind see
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.400]  it.
[06:34.400 --> 06:37.040]  The next generation of children are told you're never going to die.
[06:37.040 --> 06:38.040]  One problem.
[06:38.040 --> 06:45.880]  You've got to upload the cube, it shows up, and then it blows the earth up on its time.
[06:45.880 --> 06:50.840]  Now, there's another thing.
[06:50.840 --> 06:55.920]  Cubes got folks that worked for it, the 12-foot-tall red devils.
[06:55.920 --> 07:00.960]  Now, it gets into psychic imprints.
[07:00.960 --> 07:04.560]  It gets into how this is the plan for humanity.
[07:04.560 --> 07:09.520]  It's an allegory and it teaches you that Satan's really your friend.
[07:09.520 --> 07:16.080]  He's 12-foot-tall and has big, giant horns and looks just like the devil in legend.
[07:16.080 --> 07:20.640]  You pull that up with the Tom Cruise or even pull up for anybody that wants to look it
[07:20.640 --> 07:24.080]  up, the new remake of Childhood's End that came out on national television.
[07:24.080 --> 07:28.320]  Owen Schroder is about to take over.
[07:28.320 --> 07:38.320]  I wasn't even going to be here today, but I came in because studying the mRNA vaccines,
[07:38.320 --> 07:48.360]  the term vaccine you've been taught is learning immunity by being given a damaged amount of
[07:48.360 --> 07:50.000]  the bacteria or the virus.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.240]  Your body learns how to beat it and learns how to recognize it.
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.400]  It's got side effects and it's got problems and it's got fetal tissue in it and it's got
[07:56.400 --> 08:02.880]  whole human genomes and it's got cancer viruses and it's got HCG, female hormone in it so
[08:02.880 --> 08:07.760]  your body then sees that as the antigen that's also part of the virus and then attacks the
[08:07.760 --> 08:17.440]  proteins in that hormone and then attacks your ovaries, then attacks your uterus and
[08:17.440 --> 08:22.280]  you can just type into any search engine.
[08:22.280 --> 08:26.280]  Anti-fertility vaccines and the U.N. developed in the Adam's and the 80s and it's the HCG
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.480]  when they got caught giving people.
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.680]  You can go, well, we got too many Africans or we got too many folks in Pakistan or whatever.
[08:32.680 --> 08:34.000]  Well, that's the immoral thing.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.480]  I disagree with saying let's just kill them.
[08:36.480 --> 08:46.600]  Let's see, that's 50, 60, 70-year-old technology.
[08:46.600 --> 08:53.120]  Moderna and two other groups working with Bill Gates that brought you the Gardasil shot
[08:53.120 --> 08:57.960]  that just so happens to make women's ovaries where they can't grow follicles every month
[08:57.960 --> 08:58.960]  to release an egg.
[08:58.960 --> 09:02.440]  Just a little side effect that it reduces fertility massively.
[09:02.440 --> 09:09.480]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, the new mRNA class, the Vanderbilt scientists and others write
[09:09.480 --> 09:10.480]  out a mainstream news code.
[09:10.480 --> 09:11.480]  It's incredible.
[09:11.480 --> 09:19.000]  We're rewriting the cells instead of you learning immunity, the nanotech, the artificial synthetic
[09:19.000 --> 09:28.000]  nanotech-like particles go into your cell nucleus like cancer does, usually viral, and
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.640]  starts having you produce it and it can go after proteins associated with heroin or nicotine
[09:35.640 --> 09:40.320]  or alcohol, which your body has receptors for for a reason because it produced natural
[09:40.320 --> 09:41.320]  endorphins.
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.280]  When you stand up to the bully and kick his ass or you finally marry the woman of your
[09:45.280 --> 09:48.960]  dreams or you see your son or daughter become successful and do the right thing, you get
[09:48.960 --> 09:51.440]  endorphins because you're designed to feel good.
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.400]  They want to cut that off from you.
[09:53.400 --> 09:54.400]  Don't worry.
[09:54.400 --> 09:55.400]  This is a total takeover.
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.440]  There's whole classes of these, behavioral unit, but it's going to be miracle-like though.
[10:01.440 --> 10:05.320]  They can have it go in these viruses, there's nanotechs here.
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.880]  The secret is it uses nanotech to use your cells to reprogram them.
[10:09.880 --> 10:11.560]  They admit they say, we can't do this in the lab.
[10:11.560 --> 10:15.200]  We kept trying for 50 years, Gates isn't trying for 30.
[10:15.200 --> 10:17.160]  We can't produce all these things in the lab.
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.240]  We have to use your cells to produce it.
[10:20.240 --> 10:22.880]  And so your body is now a factory of these people.
[10:22.880 --> 10:26.320]  Beyond the Communist Chinese, just taking your organs.
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.040]  And it's all about the post-human world because they're all going to be gods, you see.
[10:30.040 --> 10:32.440]  And here's the other big secret.
[10:32.440 --> 10:37.120]  When Elon Musk, who I think now is a good guy, he came up with the brain-ship stuff to warn
[10:37.120 --> 10:40.120]  people.
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.800]  When Elon came out and he said, beware tech lords that dream of AI gods because that's
[10:45.800 --> 10:47.160]  what they believe they're going to be.
[10:47.160 --> 10:50.040]  He says, I don't want to be part of this cult.
[10:50.040 --> 10:53.760]  But they're on record, this is their plan, and you're the guinea pigs.
[10:53.760 --> 10:54.880]  I'm the guinea pig.
[10:54.880 --> 10:57.600]  My children are the guinea pig for their operations.
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.400]  All of this is guinea pigging on us because they know out of 7.5 billion people, every
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.080]  one of us has different proteins.
[11:06.080 --> 11:13.240]  Starting 45 years ago, a worldwide program of the UN taking everybody's blood at birth
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.400]  saying it's for a protein test for a blood disease, it all goes to the United Nations.
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.120]  We first exposed that with nurses in 1997, there were lawsuits, became national news,
[11:23.120 --> 11:24.120]  5,000.
[11:24.120 --> 11:27.360]  That's something going on 45 years, and it turned out the companies bought your blood
[11:27.360 --> 11:29.960]  sample, patented the original protein.
[11:29.960 --> 11:33.480]  When you go to get gene therapy, people are being told, that'll be a million dollars.
[11:33.480 --> 11:37.000]  We own your own body's protein.
[11:37.000 --> 11:42.960]  Every one of us is different, just like a snowflake, just like every fingerprints do.
[11:42.960 --> 11:47.240]  And they're playing God right now, and that's what COVID and the lockdown is, and you'll
[11:47.240 --> 11:51.680]  all be superstars, you'll all be wonderful people, you'll all be the coolest when you
[11:51.680 --> 11:56.880]  take the shots and you're the pioneers, and Gates admits these vaccines are gonna hurt
[11:56.880 --> 11:57.880]  a bunch of people.
[11:57.880 --> 12:02.760]  He says 700,000 people are gonna get hurt or die from just one of the vaccines, but
[12:02.760 --> 12:06.920]  it's okay because we've got to make humanity perfect.
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.160]  Okay, folks.
[12:11.160 --> 12:20.600]  I'm gonna have Owen Troyer take over, and then David Knight's gonna be coming in here,
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.720]  and he's an engineer and a smart guy to go over all this for you.
[12:23.720 --> 12:26.560]  They also have nanotech lipids.
[12:26.560 --> 12:38.640]  They admit are artificial oils that are bringing the nanotech viruses into yourselves to reprogram
[12:38.640 --> 12:39.640]  them.
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.320]  These guys were God, they know how to do this, but instead, they're globalists, think of
[12:43.320 --> 12:44.320]  the mistakes and the problems.
[12:44.320 --> 12:46.840]  Oh, and then you learn they want depopulation and they're bad people.
[12:46.840 --> 12:50.800]  This isn't gonna be mistakes, and this isn't gonna be problems.
[12:50.800 --> 12:58.320]  This is gonna be them testing all of this on us in mass, but then take our blood and
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.240]  take our tissues and create systems for them that they have purified.
[13:03.240 --> 13:11.200]  So, this is like the Skexies sucking the energy of the Gelflings archetypally, but for real.
[13:11.200 --> 13:12.600]  This is the next level of slavery.
[13:12.600 --> 13:16.080]  You think the globalists are into the royal families and taking kids' blood and having
[13:16.080 --> 13:17.080]  transfusions of it?
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.080]  That's all admitted.
[13:18.080 --> 13:21.120]  I told you about that 25 years ago, didn't believe it, now it's mainstream news.
[13:21.120 --> 13:22.120]  This is beyond that.
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.160]  This is taking over your children's bodies and turning their cells into factories with
[13:26.160 --> 13:31.480]  engineered nanoviruses, completely alien.
[13:31.480 --> 13:34.080]  This is the alien takeover, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:34.080 --> 13:36.920]  This is the new world order.
[13:36.920 --> 13:40.560]  This is the reality, and that's why they want us all fair, because they want you to get
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.280]  blindsided by this, this evolutionary takeover, just like the thing.
[13:45.280 --> 13:48.200]  The thing grabs you, takes over each one of your cells.
[13:48.200 --> 13:51.040]  But this is all done through vaccines very slowly.
[13:51.040 --> 13:52.280]  They're testing it.
[13:52.280 --> 13:54.800]  They go in with thermal populations.
[13:54.800 --> 13:58.360]  They test the really dangerous stuff, then they refine it, they bring it back here.
[13:58.360 --> 13:59.640]  It's got soft kill.
[13:59.640 --> 14:00.840]  It's got time release.
[14:00.840 --> 14:02.200]  It's got Trojan horses.
[14:02.200 --> 14:03.200]  It's everything.
[14:03.200 --> 14:10.920]  It's big pharma jumping on us with its tentacles and sucking us in and taking us over and telling
[14:10.920 --> 14:12.520]  us it's all okay.
[14:12.520 --> 14:15.240]  This is the alien takeover.
[14:15.240 --> 14:17.000]  These nanoparticles are alien.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.080]  They take over each one of your cells.
[14:19.080 --> 14:23.320]  They end who you are, but it's run by people who believe they've got to end humanity to
[14:23.320 --> 14:24.680]  become this new God.
[14:24.680 --> 14:26.240]  They believe they are aliens.
[14:26.240 --> 14:28.720]  So is there a dark force directing them?
[14:28.720 --> 14:32.320]  Yes, an alien force that fell this planet, that is not even advanced enough to get off
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.280]  of it, but is using us to build its system for escape.
[14:37.280 --> 14:41.440]  And that's why they're so pissed because we've cracked their entire code and they throw it
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.720]  to us in allegories like the thing.
[14:43.720 --> 14:46.320]  It's trying to get off.
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.960]  Now, it's not going to do that until it's absorbed us and taken everything we've got
[14:50.960 --> 14:54.240]  because we're more advanced than it, just at a baby stage.
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.560]  This is the transmission.
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.920]  We can save itself with God's help if you face the reality of the alien takeover.
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.480]  And if you financially support us, the enemy's trying to shut us down, huge mega sale will
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.720]  finally end today because we've just got to end because a bunch of stuff is selling out
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  in FullWarStore.com.
[15:08.720 --> 15:10.920]  Our destroyer is going to take over.
[15:10.920 --> 15:11.920]  Everyone call everyone you know.
[15:11.920 --> 15:14.520]  Tell them tune in now.
[15:14.520 --> 15:18.160]  The vaccines are synthetic nanotech that rewrite the body.
[15:18.160 --> 15:21.040]  This is an alien takeover of humanity.
[15:21.040 --> 15:23.600]  This is beyond Mars attacks.
[15:23.600 --> 15:29.200]  The aliens came from the psychotic satanic dreams of the Satanist with modern science
[15:29.200 --> 15:34.360]  building the systems now to use us to be the engines to create these new life forms while
[15:34.360 --> 15:37.960]  we are absorbed like a spider sucking dry.
[15:37.960 --> 15:38.960]  It's prey.
[15:38.960 --> 15:43.840]  Oh, I'm not a damn fly and I want you spiders to know that we're aware of your operation.
[15:43.840 --> 15:45.040]  We've got the jump on you.
[15:45.040 --> 15:50.640]  You go ahead and fill your hand because you're going down in full wars.com tomorrow's news
[15:50.640 --> 15:55.520]  today, Owen Schreuer, the destroyer with David Knight takes over.
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.020]  Stay with us.
[15:57.020 --> 16:00.000]  Haul and Block has really been a sleeper product for us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.600]  We got it in a few years ago.
[16:01.600 --> 16:06.080]  It's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs.
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.320]  They discovered this more than 30 years ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from
[16:10.320 --> 16:16.000]  a certain type of quail that it had an antihistamine effect and people saw their allergies and
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.440]  seasonal discomfort knocked way, way down.
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.920]  Well, now this is available in the United States, it's proprietary, it has rave reviews.
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.440]  It's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become
[16:28.440 --> 16:29.440]  a best seller.
[16:29.440 --> 16:32.560]  We're very close to selling out pollen block right now.
[16:32.560 --> 16:37.360]  It'll take eight weeks to get more in, but despite that, I'm going to sell it at 50% off
[16:37.360 --> 16:38.360]  until it sells out.
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.600]  So for those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence and have seasonal
[16:42.600 --> 16:50.160]  discomfort, experience pollen block for yourself right now at m4store.com for 50% off pollen
[16:50.160 --> 16:51.160]  block.
[16:51.160 --> 16:54.480]  I want people that haven't tried it to try it for themselves so it's the lowest price
[16:54.480 --> 16:57.480]  ever even though it's selling out.
[16:57.480 --> 17:06.960]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[17:06.960 --> 17:14.720]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality specifically
[17:14.720 --> 17:21.760]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[17:21.760 --> 17:22.760]  in males.
[17:22.760 --> 17:28.720]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.600]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[17:33.600 --> 17:34.600]  Yes.
[17:34.600 --> 17:41.040]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[17:41.040 --> 17:46.040]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb packed formula.
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.600]  So what are you waiting for?
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.640]  Go to the N4 Store.
[17:49.640 --> 17:59.800]  Never been a better time than right now, super male vitality at n4store.com.
[17:59.800 --> 18:15.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.160]  Well ladies and gentlemen, I'm not sure how you follow up that segment.
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.440]  And so we're going to have David Knight in studio coming up in the next segment to really
[18:24.440 --> 18:32.840]  get into the ins and outs of this with a much better understanding, but I'll just say this.
[18:32.840 --> 18:44.160]  The next evolutionary leap or step, but it really is a leap of mankind, of humanity is
[18:44.160 --> 18:52.920]  being planned right now, synthetically, because the people that have recognized this and seen
[18:52.920 --> 18:56.960]  where this technology goes have decided they want to be out in front of it and they want
[18:56.960 --> 19:00.480]  to build it so that they can be in control of it.
[19:00.480 --> 19:07.200]  And so imagine you got a pregnant woman and you say, well, we're going to speed up the
[19:07.200 --> 19:13.680]  biological process and we're going to pump that baby out in two weeks.
[19:13.680 --> 19:18.560]  And so you speed it up and the baby comes out, but it's not even recognizable as human
[19:18.560 --> 19:26.560]  because you didn't go through the natural biological process of making a baby.
[19:26.560 --> 19:34.360]  So that's what this is like overnight in a flash, we're taking a giant evolutionary
[19:34.360 --> 19:44.400]  leap merging with this technology, except it's going to be sold to us as a miracle cure
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.920]  as a be all end all, and it doesn't matter that they won't even be honest about any testing
[19:50.920 --> 19:57.520]  or prior rollout to this that they've had, we'll all take it because a, we're either
[19:57.520 --> 20:04.400]  afraid of a virus that the TV told us to be afraid of, or you may be blind or have some
[20:04.400 --> 20:08.360]  other degenerative disease and you may want it.
[20:08.360 --> 20:11.640]  But then what happens in the second generation or the third generation or the fourth or
[20:11.640 --> 20:14.800]  the fifth generation, well, then you're not even human anymore.
[20:14.800 --> 20:19.640]  And you see, then you don't have any rights because you're an alien, but Bill Gates and
[20:19.640 --> 20:22.480]  all the people at the top, they never took the vaccine.
[20:22.480 --> 20:23.480]  They're still human.
[20:23.480 --> 20:27.440]  Now they rule the planet.
[20:27.440 --> 20:31.320]  And so when they destroy the planet and then think they can jet off to space, you'll get
[20:31.320 --> 20:34.960]  left behind because you're no longer human.
[20:34.960 --> 20:36.960]  And so that's their plan.
[20:36.960 --> 20:38.720]  That's what they're doing.
[20:38.720 --> 20:45.880]  They've had to move it forward faster than they wanted because America, about 10 to 20
[20:45.880 --> 20:50.280]  to 30, maybe max percent of us are not totally asleep and are trying to fight back against
[20:50.280 --> 20:51.800]  this.
[20:51.800 --> 20:57.560]  And then you've got some people in Europe and some people in Australia, but I mean, everybody's
[20:57.560 --> 21:03.920]  looking at the West and the United States because the way of the West so goes the way
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.640]  of the world at this point because the Chinese people will take whatever vaccine they're
[21:08.640 --> 21:13.360]  told they won't have a choice.
[21:13.360 --> 21:18.880]  So we're going to get into this nanotech vaccine that's about to be forced upon us with David
[21:18.880 --> 21:20.920]  Knight coming up.
[21:20.920 --> 21:24.520]  And you know, I've got some pretty incredible news stories out here today.
[21:24.520 --> 21:25.960]  I hope I'll have time to get to them.
[21:25.960 --> 21:32.560]  But I mean, my goodness, the corruption of Barack Obama, unbelievable as more is coming
[21:32.560 --> 21:40.080]  out and then the lies from Comey and the rest of them just totally exposed.
[21:40.080 --> 21:46.760]  And where is the media nowhere to be found an excellent story out of the Wall Street
[21:46.760 --> 21:52.680]  Journal, which really is actually a couple weeks old or a week old, which really tells
[21:52.680 --> 21:59.400]  the main story leading into the 2020 election year politically speaking, compare Florida
[21:59.400 --> 22:08.440]  and New York on all fronts, Florida and New York, Florida mostly conservative run by Republicans
[22:08.440 --> 22:14.240]  New York, mostly liberal progressive run by Democrats.
[22:14.240 --> 22:17.600]  Look at the budgets in New York.
[22:17.600 --> 22:19.040]  The budget is unbalanced.
[22:19.040 --> 22:20.040]  They're bankrupt.
[22:20.040 --> 22:23.960]  They're billions in debt.
[22:23.960 --> 22:26.800]  They also have much higher taxes than Florida.
[22:26.800 --> 22:35.640]  So they tax their citizens more on average in New York, the quality of life is lower.
[22:35.640 --> 22:37.480]  The income is lower.
[22:37.480 --> 22:38.600]  The rent is higher.
[22:38.600 --> 22:40.440]  Your taxes are higher.
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.720]  Your balance or your budget is not balanced.
[22:42.720 --> 22:46.920]  And by the way, you have a massive outbreak of a coronavirus.
[22:46.920 --> 22:49.720]  But then you go down to Florida.
[22:49.720 --> 22:54.760]  Florida has a higher population than New York.
[22:54.760 --> 23:02.800]  No state income tax yet a balanced budget, lower taxes, balanced budget.
[23:02.800 --> 23:07.520]  No coronavirus outbreak.
[23:07.520 --> 23:16.840]  No state massive debt that they can't even run a budget on.
[23:16.840 --> 23:20.600]  Now why is this so important?
[23:20.600 --> 23:27.960]  Because going into 2020, there is no debate, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:27.960 --> 23:29.200]  I'm not a Republican.
[23:29.200 --> 23:38.720]  Quite frankly, I think there's very few real patriots, real Americans left in our Congress.
[23:38.720 --> 23:44.440]  Most of them happen to be Republican, but it's a small handful.
[23:44.440 --> 23:51.120]  But if you get the average American to see how the Democrat Party is just an abject failure
[23:51.120 --> 23:54.240]  on all fronts, they can't stop an outbreak.
[23:54.240 --> 23:56.440]  They spread it.
[23:56.440 --> 23:59.560]  They can't balance a budget.
[23:59.560 --> 24:03.880]  They can't figure out a tax system that works.
[24:03.880 --> 24:10.400]  And so their response to all of that is just to take your freedoms.
[24:10.400 --> 24:12.680]  And so there's actually an update now.
[24:12.680 --> 24:14.520]  This is from Town Hall Finance.
[24:14.520 --> 24:15.520]  I haven't seen this one.
[24:15.520 --> 24:19.080]  New York versus Florida round four.
[24:19.080 --> 24:23.880]  Now I'm wondering if this is going to play out for the rest of 2020.
[24:23.880 --> 24:27.800]  With states like California staying closed, Texas reopening.
[24:27.800 --> 24:31.800]  States like Illinois staying closed, Missouri reopening.
[24:31.800 --> 24:36.840]  States like New York staying closed, Florida reopening.
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.160]  Because the story is obviously going to go.
[24:40.160 --> 24:46.580]  The economy is going to collapse in those states drastically.
[24:46.580 --> 24:50.480]  It already has, but it'll be fully exposed now.
[24:50.480 --> 24:54.760]  You won't be able to avoid the effects.
[24:54.760 --> 24:56.960]  And then in Texas, people will be working.
[24:56.960 --> 24:57.960]  Economy will be booming.
[24:57.960 --> 24:59.600]  Florida, people will be working.
[24:59.600 --> 25:01.880]  Economy will be booming.
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.880]  Missouri, people will be working.
[25:03.880 --> 25:05.880]  Economy will be booming.
[25:05.880 --> 25:08.720]  But Illinois, California, New York.
[25:08.720 --> 25:14.800]  State economy, forced vaccinations, no freedoms.
[25:14.800 --> 25:17.480]  And this is the path that we're on.
[25:17.480 --> 25:25.280]  And so it's very important for people to understand how much of a total failure the Democrat party
[25:25.280 --> 25:26.280]  has been for this country.
[25:26.280 --> 25:32.560]  Now, you consider and talk about how that's intentional and get into that, but most people
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.560]  can't even get that, folks, quite frankly.
[25:35.560 --> 25:42.440]  I mean, if the average American can't see in a compare and contrast between the Democrats
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.760]  and Republican, and then they end up going and voting Democrat year after year after
[25:45.760 --> 25:50.160]  year, it's going to be tough to get them to understand some basic stuff.
[25:50.160 --> 25:55.600]  But the more basic you make it, the more on its face it is, the better chance they have
[25:55.600 --> 25:56.600]  of understanding.
[25:56.600 --> 25:58.280]  Again, I'm not a Republican.
[25:58.280 --> 26:05.160]  I'm not up here stumping for the Republican party, but I mean, I am for freedom.
[26:05.160 --> 26:06.680]  I am for a good economy.
[26:06.680 --> 26:09.160]  I am for the free market.
[26:09.160 --> 26:15.800]  And right now that's the side of the Republican party.
[26:15.800 --> 26:16.800]  It's not perfect.
[26:16.800 --> 26:18.800]  It's not all good.
[26:18.800 --> 26:25.240]  But you look at the Democrat party, it's all bad.
[26:25.240 --> 26:29.480]  And I've got this whole stack of news I hope I can get to as David Knight is coming up
[26:29.480 --> 26:33.640]  to talk about the nanotech vaccines that are about to force upon us.
[26:33.640 --> 26:35.760]  But folks, there is no doubt anymore.
[26:35.760 --> 26:37.160]  There is zero doubt.
[26:37.160 --> 26:43.280]  The coronavirus pandemic has been a giant hoax, and it's now being used politically
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.040]  by the Democrat party.
[26:46.040 --> 26:47.560]  And America's pissed.
[26:47.560 --> 26:50.080]  So it's time to start calling out for what it is.
[26:50.080 --> 26:54.800]  It's a giant political hoax, and the Democrats are using it to take your freedom.
[26:54.800 --> 26:57.920]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[26:57.920 --> 27:04.440]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended
[27:04.440 --> 27:10.800]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.800]  in full control.
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.920]  Many will submit through fear.
[27:14.920 --> 27:15.920]  Others will be bought off.
[27:15.920 --> 27:20.680]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[27:20.680 --> 27:27.680]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[27:27.680 --> 27:34.560]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[27:34.560 --> 27:41.120]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[27:41.120 --> 27:42.120]  this.
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.800]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[27:46.800 --> 27:52.160]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[27:52.160 --> 27:54.240]  disgusting power trip.
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.080]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[27:58.080 --> 28:02.240]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything we've
[28:02.240 --> 28:04.840]  talked about, horrible, has come true.
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.640]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.120]  It's like telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have
[28:12.120 --> 28:16.200]  little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[28:16.200 --> 28:17.200]  People don't listen.
[28:17.200 --> 28:18.760]  They go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[28:18.760 --> 28:22.160]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the
[28:22.160 --> 28:23.160]  first world.
[28:23.160 --> 28:29.400]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated
[28:29.400 --> 28:30.400]  it.
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.000]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.400]  and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human
[28:38.400 --> 28:39.400]  technocracy.
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.680]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[28:44.680 --> 28:47.120]  because it's their operations manual.
[28:47.120 --> 28:51.960]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major
[28:51.960 --> 28:54.960]  institutions and we've got to stop them.
[28:54.960 --> 28:59.960]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global, corporatist media and the chai comms
[28:59.960 --> 29:03.640]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[29:03.640 --> 29:07.640]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[29:07.640 --> 29:08.640]  world.
[29:08.640 --> 29:13.840]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's
[29:13.840 --> 29:14.840]  going to be.
[29:14.840 --> 29:20.200]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[29:20.200 --> 29:21.200]  economy.
[29:21.200 --> 29:25.240]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.520]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[29:30.520 --> 29:32.400]  They've admitted all of this.
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.480]  So remember, how does infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.400]  things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle
[29:43.400 --> 29:46.720]  plan and yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary.
[29:46.720 --> 29:50.880]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[29:50.880 --> 29:57.280]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[29:57.280 --> 30:12.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:12.160 --> 30:18.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.440]  front lines of the Infowar.
[30:23.440 --> 30:25.120]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[30:25.120 --> 30:30.880]  I'm sure David Knight in studio at the Infowars World headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[30:30.880 --> 30:38.000]  And so David for the next hour is going to be getting into the ins and outs of how viruses
[30:38.000 --> 30:43.720]  function and bacteria function and also the technology that comes along with these new
[30:43.720 --> 30:48.520]  nanotech vaccines and then we'll also get into the financial aspect of this because there's
[30:48.520 --> 30:50.120]  that involved as well.
[30:50.120 --> 30:52.720]  Hey, some people are in this straight up for money.
[30:52.720 --> 30:54.960]  Other people are in this for power.
[30:54.960 --> 30:57.000]  And so we're going to separate the two.
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.760]  And all I see here, David, is to me what's clear as day is this is a giant power grab.
[31:02.760 --> 31:03.760]  Oh yeah.
[31:03.760 --> 31:05.280]  There's zero doubt about that.
[31:05.280 --> 31:09.160]  And the fact that they've used the coronavirus is more of a confirmation.
[31:09.160 --> 31:12.200]  But you know, a lot of people would say that this is a conspiracy theory.
[31:12.200 --> 31:13.200]  They couldn't even believe it.
[31:13.200 --> 31:15.960]  This is all official Moderna text here.
[31:15.960 --> 31:17.600]  You know, there's no conspiracy here.
[31:17.600 --> 31:18.840]  They're celebrating what they're doing.
[31:18.840 --> 31:21.400]  They think this is a great feat of technology.
[31:21.400 --> 31:24.240]  And I'm sure it will be for them.
[31:24.240 --> 31:27.240]  But for the rest of us that become slaves after this, it's not going to be so much.
[31:27.240 --> 31:32.520]  So do you want to start briefly getting into the difference between a virus and a bacteria
[31:32.520 --> 31:37.640]  and then how they're going to be using viruses technology to get into our bodies?
[31:37.640 --> 31:41.160]  Let's talk a little bit about how this is a different kind of vaccine.
[31:41.160 --> 31:43.720]  This is not your grandparents' vaccine, right?
[31:43.720 --> 31:49.720]  A vaccine, as most people think about it, it's a weakened, if it's still alive, a pathogen,
[31:49.720 --> 31:53.920]  or maybe a dead one so that your body can understand how to fight it.
[31:53.920 --> 31:55.400]  This is not what this is.
[31:55.400 --> 31:58.840]  And of course, you know, the problem with that is, of course, that they've added adjuvants
[31:58.840 --> 32:01.480]  things to irritate your immune system.
[32:01.480 --> 32:05.320]  And that creates problems, also preservatives that are in it, so contaminants and toxins
[32:05.320 --> 32:07.160]  and so forth that are in the vaccines.
[32:07.160 --> 32:09.240]  All of those things have been issues.
[32:09.240 --> 32:14.480]  But now we have a new paradigm, and this is what this company Moderna is really about.
[32:14.480 --> 32:19.880]  They began by calling themselves Mode RNA, and what they were referring to was Messenger
[32:19.880 --> 32:21.160]  RNA.
[32:21.160 --> 32:27.480]  The idea behind this is that instead of manufacturing a vaccine and injecting that into you, what
[32:27.480 --> 32:32.920]  they would do is they would inject some RNA fragments, and that would make your body turn
[32:32.920 --> 32:36.720]  into a vaccine manufacturer itself.
[32:36.720 --> 32:44.560]  And so in this particular COVID-19 vaccine, the idea is that they're going to encode with
[32:44.560 --> 32:50.640]  RNA fragments the ability to reproduce the spike that is associated with the coronavirus.
[32:50.640 --> 32:54.000]  Remember, you see the coronavirus, and it's got a ball with all the, you've seen all the
[32:54.000 --> 32:55.000]  pictures.
[32:55.000 --> 32:59.800]  Everybody is celebrating it like it's some kind of, you know, holiday or something.
[32:59.800 --> 33:05.560]  Anyway, you've seen the spikes, so it would encode just that spike, and that presumably
[33:05.560 --> 33:09.400]  would cause your body to produce antibodies to fight that.
[33:09.400 --> 33:13.960]  And so we'll talk about the finances behind this because you have to understand that Moderna
[33:13.960 --> 33:16.680]  has been around for about 10 years.
[33:16.680 --> 33:21.840]  Within the pharmaceutical industry, there's a lot of concerns about the company.
[33:21.840 --> 33:23.320]  They've been highly secretive.
[33:23.320 --> 33:27.040]  They don't write papers, which is unusual because most of the pharmaceutical companies
[33:27.040 --> 33:29.360]  like to write papers.
[33:29.360 --> 33:32.480]  It's kind of a PR thing for them, so it's a very different pattern.
[33:32.480 --> 33:38.400]  You've seen this once before with a company that was very secretive, and ultimately it
[33:38.400 --> 33:41.480]  turned into a massive scam, so we'll talk about that.
[33:41.480 --> 33:46.560]  A lot of people are concerned that Moderna has been more hype than anything else, and
[33:46.560 --> 33:49.800]  they've been roundly criticized for years, four or five years.
[33:49.800 --> 33:53.680]  People have been calling them out saying, I'm not really sure that this is a legitimate
[33:53.680 --> 33:54.680]  company.
[33:54.680 --> 33:58.640]  I think it's more of an investment scam than it is a scientific operation.
[33:58.640 --> 34:06.280]  Plus, the guy who is now the White House vaccine czar, Monsef Slouy, was formerly on the board
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.480]  of Moderna.
[34:07.480 --> 34:09.280]  He left just days ago.
[34:09.280 --> 34:12.480]  He'd previously worked for decades for GlaxoSmithKline.
[34:12.480 --> 34:14.760]  He'd been head of vaccine development there.
[34:14.760 --> 34:21.120]  He'd developed an HPV vaccine and so forth, and now within the last 48 hours, he's made
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.920]  a killing in the stock market, more than $12 million exercising options there, but it's
[34:25.920 --> 34:32.560]  important to remember that no mRNA vaccine has ever been approved for use for humans,
[34:32.560 --> 34:36.880]  which makes it very, very concerning that they're going to push this thing out at operation
[34:36.880 --> 34:37.880]  warp speed.
[34:37.880 --> 34:39.440]  They're going to do it very, very quickly.
[34:39.440 --> 34:44.720]  They've accelerated it, and they have eviscerated the approval and the testing aspects of this,
[34:44.720 --> 34:45.720]  and we're going to get into that in a moment.
[34:45.720 --> 34:50.120]  By the way, just real quick, the irony of that is, of course, they're sitting here attacking
[34:50.120 --> 34:54.320]  hydroxychloroquine, which by all studies has a 90% success rate.
[34:54.320 --> 34:57.840]  That's even taking patients that shouldn't be on it to begin with, and it's just still
[34:57.840 --> 34:58.840]  90%.
[34:58.840 --> 35:00.440]  There is no success rate for this vaccine.
[35:00.440 --> 35:01.560]  They've never even tested it.
[35:01.560 --> 35:05.360]  So they attack the known preventative measure.
[35:05.360 --> 35:09.120]  Well, they're anecdotal, and yet you've got thousands of people that have been treated
[35:09.120 --> 35:12.600]  with, oh, that's just anecdotal, but they will have this particular trial where they
[35:12.600 --> 35:19.520]  had 45 people, they injected with this vaccine, eight of the 45, they say, produced antibodies,
[35:19.520 --> 35:24.360]  and on the basis of that, you saw the entire stock market go up by 1,000 points.
[35:24.360 --> 35:28.200]  They made a killing, and Montess, we made a killing on that as well.
[35:28.200 --> 35:29.480]  How convenient for him.
[35:29.480 --> 35:32.800]  And I think it's just important for people to point that out when we're addressing the
[35:32.800 --> 35:38.160]  vaccines because they see hydroxychloroquine being attacked all day long from, call it
[35:38.160 --> 35:42.200]  the hate Trump media, hate American media, communist media, Chinese media, but oh, when
[35:42.200 --> 35:46.160]  it's the vaccine, we need that vaccine, we're going to push that, even though we don't know
[35:46.160 --> 35:49.440]  if it's a 90% success rate, 100% or 0%.
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.160]  You got Piers Morgan writing a hateful op-ed piece, you probably see it on the Drudge Report,
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.880]  I think it was there, saying Trump is going to be responsible for people dying because
[35:58.880 --> 36:00.880]  he said he's taking a HCQ.
[36:00.880 --> 36:05.440]  That's like if I shoot myself in the head and then someone else commits suicide, that
[36:05.440 --> 36:06.440]  is my fault.
[36:06.440 --> 36:07.440]  That's right.
[36:07.440 --> 36:10.680]  But the thing is, you can't get this without a prescription, right?
[36:10.680 --> 36:17.080]  And the effects of this, and there are effects, every pharmaceutical drug has negative side
[36:17.080 --> 36:19.880]  effects, serious things that you should be aware of.
[36:19.880 --> 36:25.280]  It is a prescription drug, but it's been used since the 1940s, first for malaria, now for
[36:25.280 --> 36:29.960]  a variety of things, and so the negative side effects and the risks are very well known
[36:29.960 --> 36:31.280]  after 60 years.
[36:31.280 --> 36:36.240]  We're rushing off into a vaccine that hasn't been tested, and not only that, but a vaccine
[36:36.240 --> 36:40.800]  technology that has never worked and has never been cleared for humans.
[36:40.800 --> 36:45.720]  We're going to rush into that and make things like remdesivir, which has never worked.
[36:45.720 --> 36:50.600]  They've tried to push that for HIV, they tried to push it for Ebola, they never found that
[36:50.600 --> 36:51.600]  it was effective for anything.
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.120]  So they're going to rush into these other drugs, but then pretend that this thing, which
[36:55.120 --> 36:58.720]  again, has to be done with a prescription, and it was Trump's doctor who prescribed it
[36:58.720 --> 36:59.720]  for him.
[36:59.720 --> 37:00.720]  As a preventative.
[37:00.720 --> 37:01.720]  Exactly, as a preventative.
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.520]  So the first thing we ought to always look at is the safety of something.
[37:05.520 --> 37:06.520]  First, do no harm.
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.160]  And if we know that something has been used for years, and we know that it's got certain
[37:10.160 --> 37:14.400]  risk factors, and you take that into consideration, you do that with all prescription drugs.
[37:14.400 --> 37:18.520]  But you know, that's convenient for them too, is whenever something happens, just push remdesivir
[37:18.520 --> 37:19.520]  or whatever it is.
[37:19.520 --> 37:22.640]  And then I'm sure they make millions of dollars, even though it's a totally ineffective thing.
[37:22.640 --> 37:28.400]  But you know, the other big lie here too is, you know, they act like hydroxychloroquine
[37:28.400 --> 37:30.320]  is the cure, or is what you're using.
[37:30.320 --> 37:36.640]  No, that's just the channel or the gateway to get the zinc into the cell.
[37:36.640 --> 37:39.160]  And so they don't even tell you it's really the zinc that's doing it.
[37:39.160 --> 37:40.160]  That's right.
[37:40.160 --> 37:43.320]  Hydroxychloroquine is just the tool, the method.
[37:43.320 --> 37:46.600]  And so that's why it doesn't work for everybody, but it's just more lies.
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.280]  They did some quick studies without zinc and said, say it didn't help with this, right?
[37:50.280 --> 37:51.280]  Yeah.
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.400]  And then they came out too, they pushed that and said, oh yeah.
[37:53.400 --> 37:55.600]  And then the VA said, no, that wasn't even our study.
[37:55.600 --> 37:56.800]  So they lied about that study.
[37:56.800 --> 37:58.040]  It wasn't even a real study.
[37:58.040 --> 38:00.040]  But see, there's other things too that they're not talking about.
[38:00.040 --> 38:03.400]  I mean, you talk about this, and they say, look, you got thousands of people, they and
[38:03.400 --> 38:09.160]  their doctors swear by this, you know, combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc, azithromycin for
[38:09.160 --> 38:10.160]  secondary infections.
[38:10.160 --> 38:13.240]  And they swear by that and say it's really worked, they've had thousands of patients
[38:13.240 --> 38:14.240]  that they've done.
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.640]  But don't pay any attention to that.
[38:15.640 --> 38:18.360]  Don't talk about intravenous vitamin C injections.
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.200]  Don't talk about a stem cell treatment.
[38:20.200 --> 38:26.920]  Again, in China, you had, this is, remember the entire stock market moved a thousand points.
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.480]  Moderna shot up like a coronavirus spike.
[38:30.480 --> 38:34.360]  And all of this happened because they had eight people out of 45 that they said had
[38:34.360 --> 38:35.800]  some positive results for this.
[38:35.800 --> 38:37.840]  And yeah, let's get into this on the other side.
[38:37.840 --> 38:42.000]  Let's go to Alex Jones real quick before this break to weigh in on this.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.760]  Are we ready guys?
[38:44.760 --> 38:45.760]  Go ahead.
[38:45.760 --> 38:46.760]  Okay.
[38:46.760 --> 38:49.760]  You don't have them just yet.
[38:49.760 --> 38:50.760]  Okay.
[38:50.760 --> 38:51.760]  Real quickly.
[38:51.760 --> 38:52.760]  Take a break, David.
[38:52.760 --> 38:57.520]  Well, real quickly, they had nine people, elderly people who are on desk door and they
[38:57.520 --> 39:02.520]  treated them with stem cells from umbilical cords and they found they got 100% of them
[39:02.520 --> 39:03.520]  survived.
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.040]  And not only that, but it repaired the damage to their lungs.
[39:06.040 --> 39:07.760]  Nobody wants to talk about that.
[39:07.760 --> 39:08.760]  Nobody wants to talk about that.
[39:08.760 --> 39:10.920]  So it's like known effective treatment.
[39:10.920 --> 39:11.920]  No.
[39:11.920 --> 39:12.920]  Don't talk about that.
[39:12.920 --> 39:13.920]  It's all about the money.
[39:13.920 --> 39:14.920]  It's all about the money.
[39:14.920 --> 39:15.920]  It's about the money.
[39:15.920 --> 39:16.920]  Treatment that can make us billions.
[39:16.920 --> 39:17.920]  Let's do that.
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.920]  That's right.
[39:18.920 --> 39:19.920]  That's right.
[39:19.920 --> 39:20.920]  All right.
[39:20.920 --> 39:21.920]  So we got to go to break.
[39:21.920 --> 39:23.840]  We've got, and then Alex Jones is going to be joining us.
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.440]  And then we're going to talk about the mechanisms of how this works.
[39:27.440 --> 39:30.400]  You need to understand the difference between bacteria and virus, how they operate.
[39:30.400 --> 39:32.920]  You need to understand the connection between viruses and cancer.
[39:32.920 --> 39:37.880]  You need to understand the connections between virus cancers and vaccines, and that especially
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.400]  applies to this mRNA vaccine.
[39:40.400 --> 39:53.400]  We'll be right back.
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.600]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020, and within a week or so, many of the best selling
[39:59.600 --> 40:03.800]  items that we're selling at InfoWarsTour.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.920]  In fact, last year I said I can't eat 50% off anymore because our markup isn't enough.
[40:07.920 --> 40:11.360]  Press bill is enough profit to operate this operation.
[40:11.360 --> 40:14.240]  But I want you to get the ultimate Creole Oil.
[40:14.240 --> 40:16.280]  I want you to get Vasovetes.
[40:16.280 --> 40:18.400]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[40:18.400 --> 40:20.960]  I want you to experience X2.
[40:20.960 --> 40:23.880]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[40:23.880 --> 40:29.160]  They're all in stock right now, and they're 30% to 60% off.
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.800]  Over the 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on most
[40:34.800 --> 40:38.400]  items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling out
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.360]  like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Vasovetes.
[40:41.360 --> 40:42.520]  So take action.
[40:42.520 --> 40:43.520]  Be healthier.
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.440]  Boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the InfoWars.
[40:46.440 --> 40:54.920]  Get in these great products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[40:54.920 --> 40:57.520]  The United States is not communist China.
[40:57.520 --> 41:00.480]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[41:00.480 --> 41:02.360]  We don't blow up churches.
[41:02.360 --> 41:05.560]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[41:05.560 --> 41:11.800]  But all over the news, we see the UN, billable indigates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[41:11.800 --> 41:14.880]  raising communist China for their response.
[41:14.880 --> 41:19.120]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[41:19.120 --> 41:22.280]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[41:22.280 --> 41:26.400]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying, we'll arrest you if you
[41:26.400 --> 41:27.720]  say Chinese virus.
[41:27.720 --> 41:31.440]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.640]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.600]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[41:40.600 --> 41:41.720]  power grab.
[41:41.720 --> 41:45.760]  The Resistance lives at BandotVideo and InfoWars.com.
[41:45.760 --> 41:50.080]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[41:50.080 --> 41:52.320]  their operation that much quicker.
[41:52.320 --> 41:59.400]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[41:59.400 --> 42:05.120]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.640]  crash always follows.
[42:07.640 --> 42:14.080]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[42:14.080 --> 42:15.080]  Turbo Force.
[42:15.080 --> 42:21.440]  Similar to other mix and energy packets, Turbo Force from InfoWars Life utilizes vitamins,
[42:21.440 --> 42:28.520]  amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus,
[42:28.520 --> 42:31.840]  clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[42:31.840 --> 42:38.880]  Turbo Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[42:38.880 --> 42:44.560]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turbo Force for a limited time at an incredible
[42:44.560 --> 42:46.560]  40% off.
[42:46.560 --> 42:53.920]  Wait till it's out of stock again and get Turbo Force right now, only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:16.560 --> 43:20.480]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[43:20.480 --> 43:24.920]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars, and the Third World collapsing, and everything
[43:24.920 --> 43:30.360]  else is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.920]  They're in easily totable bags, it's high-quality food, and it's good to have that box checked
[43:34.920 --> 43:35.920]  off to be ready.
[43:35.920 --> 43:36.920]  And it funds the InfoWars.
[43:36.920 --> 43:41.920]  So we have storeable food available again, InfoWarsStore.com, or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139,
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.280]  but whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent
[43:46.280 --> 43:47.280]  on them.
[43:47.280 --> 43:48.280]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[43:48.280 --> 44:18.120]  Get your storeable food at InfoWarsStore.com right now while you still can.
[44:18.120 --> 44:22.080]  And Alex Jones takes a vacation, that just means he shows up to work in a t-shirt.
[44:22.080 --> 44:26.160]  And so he's here today breaking down this incredible news, which is that we're going
[44:26.160 --> 44:31.280]  to be turned into vaccine manufacturers for Moderna, and it's going to be forced upon
[44:31.280 --> 44:33.520]  us using the coronavirus.
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.960]  And so, Alex, you were explaining this during the break, how important this is for people
[44:37.960 --> 44:38.960]  to understand.
[44:38.960 --> 44:46.520]  And I am literally on my knees, figuratively, over the phone today, talking to very important
[44:46.520 --> 44:50.760]  new thought leaders, all of them household names around the United States and the world,
[44:50.760 --> 44:53.960]  that they need to understand what these new so-called vaccines are.
[44:53.960 --> 44:56.560]  And you and David are doing a superlative job.
[44:56.560 --> 45:00.480]  Next hour, David is going to lay out all the science of it and all the records of how the
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.520]  regular vaccines are causing cancer and autoimmune disorders, and, you know, they grew vaccines
[45:04.520 --> 45:09.720]  in peanuts, peanut proteins, and now people dying of peanut allergy didn't exist.
[45:09.720 --> 45:14.560]  So already, the mad scientist testing has been incredibly evil, incredibly out of control.
[45:14.560 --> 45:16.640]  All the history of secret testing.
[45:16.640 --> 45:22.360]  But I just want to impress on people, I didn't put the headline out today that Big Pharma
[45:22.360 --> 45:28.080]  pushes mandatory vaccines with nanotech alien life forms to take over your cells.
[45:28.080 --> 45:34.480]  That's what they're calling them, is new creations that go in and then turn our cells into engines
[45:34.480 --> 45:39.080]  that they, the corporations, are programming, and all of this is mass testing on us.
[45:39.080 --> 45:43.200]  This is all being done by supercomputers, and they're already 30 years ahead of what they're
[45:43.200 --> 45:44.360]  telling us.
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.160]  And so this is the globalist takeover, and notice these big Ponzi scheme companies, they
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.160]  don't get in trouble.
[45:49.160 --> 45:52.200]  Like the woman that had the company saying they could test for cancer and all these diseases.
[45:52.200 --> 45:53.200]  She got billions of dollars.
[45:53.200 --> 45:54.200]  It was all fraud.
[45:54.200 --> 45:59.480]  She didn't get in trouble because this is the authorized crime syndicate, and this is
[45:59.480 --> 46:00.480]  so criminal.
[46:00.480 --> 46:02.920]  And so when Dershowitz says, I'm going to plunge the needle in your arm, you have no
[46:02.920 --> 46:08.200]  right to get away from it, he was involved with Epstein and with the Clintons and with
[46:08.200 --> 46:11.680]  Bill Gates in the secret project with all the top biologists.
[46:11.680 --> 46:17.800]  They had to get sex co-opted so that they could blackmail them to be able to carry this
[46:17.800 --> 46:18.800]  out.
[46:18.800 --> 46:22.280]  That's the whole point of the Caribbean island and the Zorro Ranch and the secret breeding
[46:22.280 --> 46:27.440]  programs and oh, Epstein was a weirdo, he was into spreading the seeds of the elites.
[46:27.440 --> 46:29.880]  There's a cloner operation, folks.
[46:29.880 --> 46:33.280]  We're really in the year 2050 or so when it comes to technology.
[46:33.280 --> 46:34.520]  The future's here.
[46:34.520 --> 46:37.120]  It's just not evenly distributed.
[46:37.120 --> 46:40.160]  And so that's what's really going on and happening.
[46:40.160 --> 46:44.000]  And so they had to compromise the scientific establishment to get them to go along with
[46:44.000 --> 46:45.160]  this giant criminal operation.
[46:45.160 --> 46:47.840]  Now, Dershowitz himself, you know, he's a lawyer for these guys.
[46:47.840 --> 46:49.560]  I don't know if he knows all this or any of this.
[46:49.560 --> 46:51.800]  I'm not saying he had sex with these kids.
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.840]  What I'm saying is he is a lawyer for a guy that did and now he says he's going to plunge
[46:55.840 --> 46:58.600]  the needle in our arm and we have no right to say no.
[46:58.600 --> 47:00.920]  This is not even your normal horrible vaccines.
[47:00.920 --> 47:02.720]  This is an alien takeover.
[47:02.720 --> 47:03.720]  This is not a joke.
[47:03.720 --> 47:05.160]  I'm going to stop now.
[47:05.160 --> 47:09.640]  It's just this is so incredibly intense and it's all dawning on us now how serious this
[47:09.640 --> 47:14.080]  is and how they're already doing massive human trials, paying people to be guinea pigs to
[47:14.080 --> 47:17.800]  test this because they're going to test a non-harmful version.
[47:17.800 --> 47:21.040]  Then they roll out the Trojan horse version later.
[47:21.040 --> 47:22.200]  This is their same M.O.
[47:22.200 --> 47:27.040]  Gardasil did create autoimmune responses and attack the ovaries of women that take it.
[47:27.040 --> 47:30.240]  It did kill a bunch of people so they know what they're doing.
[47:30.240 --> 47:33.720]  Folks, there's nothing more insane, nothing more dangerous.
[47:33.720 --> 47:34.920]  David Nott will lay it all the science.
[47:34.920 --> 47:36.240]  Owen Stroyer here as well.
[47:36.240 --> 47:37.240]  They're doing a great job.
[47:37.240 --> 47:40.840]  They're just in there covering all the background and the fraud and the scams and the evil but
[47:40.840 --> 47:42.040]  it's not just about the money.
[47:42.040 --> 47:46.880]  It's about the power over your body to go in and reprogram what's actually going on inside
[47:46.880 --> 47:47.880]  of it.
[47:47.880 --> 47:48.880]  I'm going to shut up.
[47:48.880 --> 48:06.600]  You guys take over, but everybody has to tell everyone they know about news wars.com oils
[48:06.600 --> 48:10.120]  It's only going to get worse, it's going to get so damn intense, and it's going to get
[48:10.120 --> 48:12.840]  so horrible, many people are just going to submit to it, because you're going to be given
[48:12.840 --> 48:17.480]  a universal income when you become a guinea pig, and when you allow yourself to be sterilized.
[48:17.480 --> 48:20.880]  Then the mass death is going to get so bad, and the deformities, and all these new humanoids,
[48:20.880 --> 48:24.880]  just like they're going to program women and have designer babies that aren't really human,
[48:24.880 --> 48:29.200]  but they're going to have all these rights, and it's going to be absolute, just total
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.680]  Satanism, where humans are turned into aliens on the planet Earth.
[48:33.680 --> 48:34.680]  That's how it works.
[48:34.680 --> 48:39.160]  If you don't come to the Earth, they literally create the nanotech, overwrite your cells,
[48:39.160 --> 48:41.960]  and totally take control of your body, and you're no longer human.
[48:41.960 --> 48:44.680]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:44.680 --> 48:51.120]  And I think their biggest weakness here, David, in that it's a window for the people to know
[48:51.120 --> 48:53.240]  that this is what they're doing.
[48:53.240 --> 48:59.400]  This is them trying to turn our bodies into their own, you know, profit manufacturing centers.
[48:59.400 --> 49:01.320]  Why would they want to be pushing this vaccine?
[49:01.320 --> 49:03.720]  Why is Bill Gates so desperate to push this vaccine?
[49:03.720 --> 49:05.840]  Why are these people so desperate to push it?
[49:05.840 --> 49:08.000]  Well, the response would be, well, they care about your health.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  Well, no, they don't.
[49:09.000 --> 49:10.480]  They obviously don't care about their health.
[49:10.480 --> 49:12.240]  They've been lying about your health for forever.
[49:12.240 --> 49:15.080]  They've been hiding all these things from you forever, so it's not about that.
[49:15.080 --> 49:17.000]  So what is it really about, David?
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.720]  It's really about money.
[49:18.720 --> 49:21.720]  I mean, the bottom line is money and power for these guys.
[49:21.720 --> 49:22.720]  Yeah, some of them have a different...
[49:22.720 --> 49:23.720]  It's the population!
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.720]  Exactly.
[49:24.720 --> 49:26.000]  That's what Gates wants.
[49:26.000 --> 49:29.160]  But these guys right here, these people have been around for 10 years.
[49:29.160 --> 49:31.040]  They've never produced a product.
[49:31.040 --> 49:35.880]  They have a very dangerous approach to this that has been abandoned by the large pharmaceutical
[49:35.880 --> 49:38.200]  companies because it is so dangerous.
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.520]  And this is the thing that we are rushing at warp speed to implement and to roll out
[49:42.520 --> 49:45.120]  to every individual in the country.
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.800]  President Trump says by the end of the year he wants 300 million doses of this vaccine
[49:49.800 --> 49:55.320]  and Montsef Slaue, who is with Moderna, said, yeah, we can do that.
[49:55.320 --> 49:59.280]  And so they get half of the money for this vaccine development.
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.880]  And this is...I just want to lay out what is the basis behind this and why nobody else
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.400]  is doing this.
[50:06.400 --> 50:09.640]  Because when he had the meeting and he was talking to pharmaceutical company executives,
[50:09.640 --> 50:11.200]  they were saying, well, it might take me years.
[50:11.200 --> 50:12.720]  Another one says, it might take me months.
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.480]  Next guy says, Moderna says, well, we got it done in 45 days and Fauci's already got
[50:16.480 --> 50:17.480]  it.
[50:17.480 --> 50:18.480]  And we're going to start trials and...
[50:18.480 --> 50:19.480]  All right, you got it.
[50:19.480 --> 50:24.520]  And half of the money, about a half a billion dollars goes to these people for this.
[50:24.520 --> 50:30.960]  What is this messenger RNA, this mode RNA was the company, now they call themselves Moderna?
[50:30.960 --> 50:36.920]  Well, this is something that instead of creating a vaccine externally, then injecting it, what
[50:36.920 --> 50:44.920]  these people do is they create RNA fragments, introduce them, and then let your body start
[50:44.920 --> 50:46.120]  to manufacture this.
[50:46.120 --> 50:47.600]  Now, that sounds kind of odd, isn't it?
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.560]  But that's really kind of the way that a virus works.
[50:49.560 --> 50:52.240]  It's really kind of the way that cancer works as well.
[50:52.240 --> 50:54.060]  There's a connection between all three of these.
[50:54.060 --> 50:59.400]  First of all, they put in this mRNA that they transfected into human cells, that's their
[50:59.400 --> 51:04.320]  term, transfection, then they differentiate that, they de-differentiate that into stem
[51:04.320 --> 51:05.320]  cells.
[51:05.320 --> 51:09.240]  Now, stem cells are very important, and it's kind of interesting to me because I have family
[51:09.240 --> 51:14.040]  members who have autoimmune disease, there are promising, very promising treatments from
[51:14.040 --> 51:19.080]  stem cells using your own stem cells, they call that biologics.
[51:19.080 --> 51:22.800]  The FDA has never said that they have any authority to stop that, and yet they shut
[51:22.800 --> 51:23.800]  that down.
[51:23.800 --> 51:24.800]  Why?
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.320]  Because there are other things that are coming using stem cells from aborted babies, using
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.800]  stem cells that are patented like we see here.
[51:31.800 --> 51:37.120]  A stem cell can become any kind of cell, it can become anything essentially, so they can
[51:37.120 --> 51:40.320]  differentiate that into the desired cell types.
[51:40.320 --> 51:44.320]  So when we look at this, Owen, and we go back and we take a look at what viruses are, I
[51:44.320 --> 51:49.240]  mean, part of the absurdity about all of this mass stuff, and I've pointed this out, is
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.480]  that, you know, as I think it was Dr. Andrew Kaufman had the best analogy.
[51:53.480 --> 51:56.720]  He said, if you think that you're going to stop these virus particles because you're
[51:56.720 --> 52:00.720]  wearing a bandana, that's kind of like putting up a chain link fence and saying you're going
[52:00.720 --> 52:02.720]  to stop the mosquitoes.
[52:02.720 --> 52:06.520]  They are so small, they're very different from bacteria.
[52:06.520 --> 52:09.560]  Bacteria took a long time for scientists to find that, but even after they discovered
[52:09.560 --> 52:14.160]  bacteria, they would start to see kind of infectious diseases moving along, and they
[52:14.160 --> 52:17.400]  didn't really understand, they said, well, we're looking at this, we don't see any bacteria.
[52:17.400 --> 52:18.400]  Why?
[52:18.400 --> 52:23.460]  Because the virus particles were so tiny they couldn't see them, it took a lot of advances
[52:23.460 --> 52:26.480]  in microscope technology before they could see the viruses.
[52:26.480 --> 52:28.520]  And the viruses are not alive.
[52:28.520 --> 52:34.720]  They're typically fragments of DNA or RNA, which is exactly what they're producing here
[52:34.720 --> 52:38.120]  with this vaccine, with Moderna.
[52:38.120 --> 52:43.480]  And when a virus comes into your body, what your cell does is it takes it in, and it starts
[52:43.480 --> 52:49.240]  to replicate that RNA, and then replicates a bunch of it, it kills the cell, and then
[52:49.240 --> 52:53.720]  all of these things head out, it's kind of like a chain reaction, like a nuclear chain
[52:53.720 --> 52:54.720]  reaction.
[52:54.720 --> 52:58.520]  And that's how your body is taken down in the same way that this happens with cancer.
[52:58.520 --> 53:02.480]  I had a sister who died of renal carcinoma, kidney cancer.
[53:02.480 --> 53:07.200]  And what happened was the kidney cells, they start, they go aberrant.
[53:07.200 --> 53:11.320]  Something happens with their RNA, their DNA, they don't start, they're not operating the
[53:11.320 --> 53:16.920]  right way, but they start rapidly reproducing, and they don't die like a normal cell does
[53:16.920 --> 53:20.400]  after a certain number of reproductions, they're kind of eternal cell lines, and interestingly
[53:20.400 --> 53:26.600]  enough they have eternal cell lines that they grow a lot of these vaccines on another
[53:26.600 --> 53:27.600]  connection to cancer.
[53:27.600 --> 53:31.880]  But anyway, the cancer cells will then start to multiply, and that's essentially what a
[53:31.880 --> 53:34.720]  virus is doing as it's starting to multiply.
[53:34.720 --> 53:38.560]  So when we go back and we look at how all this stuff is tied together and how a lot
[53:38.560 --> 53:42.520]  of viruses are highly associated with particular types of cancers.
[53:42.520 --> 53:49.040]  For example, there is a virus that's associated with leukemia, the HPV virus is associated
[53:49.040 --> 53:50.720]  with multiple types of cancer.
[53:50.720 --> 53:56.240]  You've got hepatitis B, that virus is highly associated with liver cancer and so forth.
[53:56.240 --> 53:57.960]  And how do they do this?
[53:57.960 --> 54:01.400]  Well they do it in the same, and this is why it's so dangerous when we start looking at
[54:01.400 --> 54:10.080]  this mRNA, because the very things that cause viruses to turn into cancer are the things
[54:10.080 --> 54:12.880]  that we need to be worried about with this mRNA.
[54:12.880 --> 54:15.360]  For example, it can directly damage the DNA.
[54:15.360 --> 54:21.200]  We have all these CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to do editing of DNA, and what they found is
[54:21.200 --> 54:25.960]  that it's not a scalpel, it's more like a chainsaw, and when they try to do an insertion
[54:25.960 --> 54:29.880]  in a particular spot, they wind up altering things elsewhere.
[54:29.880 --> 54:31.640]  And so it's not a precise thing.
[54:31.640 --> 54:32.840]  We've got other things coming up.
[54:32.840 --> 54:37.080]  Yeah, let's go to this break, but you know, when you hear all this, it kind of reminds
[54:37.080 --> 54:42.120]  me of the Jim Jones Kool-Aid, like this is drinking the Kool-Aid, it's going to kill
[54:42.120 --> 54:44.800]  you deader than a hammer, but drink the Kool-Aid.
[54:44.800 --> 54:47.040]  This is the end, my friends.
[54:47.040 --> 54:49.160]  My only friends, the end.
[54:49.160 --> 54:51.720]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[54:51.720 --> 54:54.880]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[54:54.880 --> 54:57.480]  The safety, the delusion.
[54:57.480 --> 55:02.800]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[55:02.800 --> 55:09.440]  Movies and partying and living like children, ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.080]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[55:13.080 --> 55:16.040]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states.
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.240]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[55:20.240 --> 55:26.040]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated
[55:26.040 --> 55:29.040]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[55:29.040 --> 55:34.720]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[55:34.720 --> 55:37.200]  absolute bondage.
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.280]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom, and Info Wars has had great victory thanks
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.920]  to your support and your prayers.
[55:45.920 --> 55:52.480]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[55:52.480 --> 55:59.240]  We will not have this sale that's coming on right now in May until our Christmas sale comes up.
[55:59.240 --> 56:05.200]  All of our best selling supplements are 30 to 60% off at infowarstore.com.
[56:05.200 --> 56:08.200]  Let me just hone in on one of the products.
[56:08.200 --> 56:10.080]  DNA Force Plus.
[56:10.080 --> 56:15.240]  It's got high quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.400]  to supercharge the effects of that.
[56:17.400 --> 56:22.920]  You learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what
[56:22.920 --> 56:28.040]  color you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[56:28.040 --> 56:30.600]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[56:30.600 --> 56:33.520]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[56:33.520 --> 56:38.560]  It doesn't make them grow, it makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[56:38.560 --> 56:47.800]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[56:47.800 --> 56:53.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:53.760 --> 57:03.640]  Folks, this is why it's so key for info wars to be on air because guess what?
[57:03.640 --> 57:08.440]  We don't have any money coming in from these big pharmaceutical companies.
[57:08.440 --> 57:14.000]  I'm not going to attack individuals or personalities at Fox News that I think may be good people.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.640]  They're never going to be allowed to talk about this.
[57:16.640 --> 57:21.760]  This is like one of the things, even the best people at Fox News will never, ever be allowed
[57:21.760 --> 57:24.600]  to talk about any of this stuff that we're highlighting here today with David Knight,
[57:24.600 --> 57:25.600]  Alex Jones, and myself.
[57:25.600 --> 57:31.440]  Oh, and Shroy, we're going to get back into all this, but again, that's why we need your
[57:31.440 --> 57:33.000]  support at infowarstore.com.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.360]  The massive sales have just been extended one more day.
[57:36.360 --> 57:39.440]  Some of the top supplements, 50% off, folks, a lot selling out.
[57:39.440 --> 57:43.520]  So get to infowarstore.com to keep us on air and take advantage of these big specials.
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.480]  But I'm thinking about how all this is playing out, David, and I'm putting some of the pieces
[57:47.480 --> 57:53.320]  together listening to you, and I'm thinking, here's Bill Gates, this guy that they push
[57:53.320 --> 57:57.040]  upon us as this be all, end all.
[57:57.040 --> 58:02.240]  And yes, he does go do public forum talks where he talks about how all humans have
[58:02.240 --> 58:03.240]  to die.
[58:03.240 --> 58:04.240]  I mean, that's his own words.
[58:04.240 --> 58:07.520]  The population down to zero, and then they kind of laugh, and he giggles, and he's in
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.160]  his little pink sweater, and he's, you know, it's all fun and games to him.
[58:12.160 --> 58:17.640]  But I realized, too, with the media, how they could actually pull this off, David.
[58:17.640 --> 58:19.440]  Bill Gates will martyr you.
[58:19.440 --> 58:20.920]  Bill Gates wants to martyr you.
[58:20.920 --> 58:23.360]  You see, you're killing the planet.
[58:23.360 --> 58:24.360]  You're evil.
[58:24.360 --> 58:25.360]  You're a parasite.
[58:25.360 --> 58:30.000]  But that's okay, because you're going to now be a martyr for Gaia.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.160]  You're now going to be a martyr for Mother Earth.
[58:32.160 --> 58:35.920]  And you dying with this injection is a good thing.
[58:35.920 --> 58:39.640]  It's the Kool-Aid, but it's good because you're a parasite, and so this is your chance to
[58:39.640 --> 58:41.960]  redeem yourself and become a martyr.
[58:41.960 --> 58:45.320]  And as I was saying in the break, David, the reason why I think they're pushing it so much,
[58:45.320 --> 58:49.840]  and this is why you're talking about phase two, the fear of the coronavirus is dying
[58:49.840 --> 58:50.840]  for the most part.
[58:50.840 --> 58:53.000]  I mean, people are going out, and the spread is false.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  I mean, the hoax is out.
[58:54.000 --> 59:00.520]  I mean, so they have to push this as hard as they can now until their hoax has been 100%
[59:00.520 --> 59:01.520]  exposed.
[59:01.520 --> 59:04.400]  But the first part of the hoax was to say, we got this new disease.
[59:04.400 --> 59:05.400]  It's novel.
[59:05.400 --> 59:06.400]  It's invisible.
[59:06.400 --> 59:07.400]  You can't tell.
[59:07.400 --> 59:08.400]  You got it.
[59:08.400 --> 59:09.400]  And it's got a very high case fatality rate.
[59:09.400 --> 59:11.960]  You're all going to die, high percentage of you are going to die.
[59:11.960 --> 59:13.640]  Then when that turns out, that's not true.
[59:13.640 --> 59:18.120]  The next stage, and I said this a long time ago, they're going to hold that back once
[59:18.120 --> 59:21.880]  that lie has been exposed, they're going to go out and they're going to start testing
[59:21.880 --> 59:24.400]  people and say, look, now it's going everywhere.
[59:24.400 --> 59:27.960]  Now you've got to go back into your hobbit holes, stay there, because this is too dangerous
[59:27.960 --> 59:28.960]  to come out.
[59:28.960 --> 59:34.440]  And when you're talking about depopulation, it's kind of interesting looking at how the
[59:34.440 --> 59:38.040]  UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainability was all based on saving the environment, right?
[59:38.040 --> 59:39.720]  And saving Gaia as you referenced.
[59:39.720 --> 59:46.640]  And when they talk about Gaia, Gaia is the idea of Mother Earth, this sentient nature
[59:46.640 --> 59:47.640]  and so forth.
[59:47.640 --> 59:50.960]  And they always portray humanity as a virus.
[59:50.960 --> 59:52.680]  And we have to be eliminated.
[59:52.680 --> 59:57.280]  And so when you look at the front end of this, a justification of it, we have to save Gaia.
[59:57.280 --> 59:59.360]  We have to save the earth from this human virus.
[59:59.360 --> 1:00:02.040]  On the back end, you look at all the different things that they wanted.
[1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:03.040]  We got to eliminate meat.
[1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:04.040]  We got to eliminate travel.
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:05.040]  We got to eliminate airplanes.
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:08.160]  We got to pack everybody into the cities and control and monitor everything that they
[1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:09.160]  do.
[1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:13.280]  We eliminate, you name it, you know, freedom, put everybody in universal basic income to
[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:15.000]  eliminate the middle class.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:21.640]  So what they wanted for both saving the environment and now for saving humanity from COVID-19,
[1:00:21.640 --> 1:00:26.320]  well, we got to save Gaia and the environment and we've got to do these things.
[1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:29.000]  And so both ends of those are exactly the same.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.120]  The reason for doing it and the end result that they're going to impose on you, we're
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:34.120]  the same.
[1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:38.160]  What they've done is they've exchanged what's in the middle and they've just very rapidly
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.160]  pushed this in.
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:43.080]  And this is what's dangerous about all this stuff, how rapidly this happened.
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.720]  And let me tell you, what they're trying to do now with this operation warp speed and
[1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:50.280]  the rapid deployment of this vaccine is really what you need to fear.
[1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:54.640]  You need to fear how quickly this is being done because if it's not being done at warp
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:58.720]  speed, you're going to catch on to what's happening and we're going to try to get you
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:02.520]  up to speed here with what the real danger is of this vaccine.
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.640]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:09.520]  It's a small window of time that they have to get this fully implemented like they want.
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  That's right.
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:12.800]  And that's one of the reasons why they got to roll it out to everybody at once.
[1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:16.640]  If they start rolling this out gradually, people are going to say, oh, wait a minute,
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:18.400]  we had some adverse effects over here.
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:19.400]  Look at what's happening.
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:22.840]  This person, they got paralyzed from this or whatever the side effects are going to be.
[1:01:22.840 --> 1:01:24.400]  And then you're going to say, well, we're not going to do that.
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:27.720]  They've got to rapidly roll this out to everybody.
[1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:32.360]  The rapidity of what this is going to be, how this is going to be done and the fact
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:36.800]  that it's going to be rolled out to everybody all at once on V-Day or whatever, vaccine
[1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:37.800]  day.
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:39.680]  This is what you really have to fear.
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:44.960]  Cause the panic, cause this area, get people afraid of death and then come sweeping in
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:49.720]  with your magical vaccine that's actually going to kill you deader than the coronavirus
[1:01:49.720 --> 1:01:52.440]  ever could.
[1:01:52.440 --> 1:01:57.240]  Now it's official, the United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:03.360]  will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside
[1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:08.080]  or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:11.160]  to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:15.280]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.800]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:26.240]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:27.440]  and a prisoner.
[1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:31.000]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.560]  anti-human group.
[1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:37.840]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:40.080]  which is global depopulation.
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:43.600]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[1:02:43.600 --> 1:02:49.520]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:50.960]  mortal enemy.
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:03:02.040]  Wake up or die.
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:08.000]  David Knight and myself are talking here during the break because they've got to rule this
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.840]  vaccine out within a month or two, folks, and they're going to use the reopening of your
[1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:16.480]  favorite sports team or your favorite bar or whatever as the excuse.
[1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:19.760]  So it'll be, oh, there'll be people in fear, I want the vaccine, and then there'll be people
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:22.560]  that say, I want to go watch a movie or watch a ball game.
[1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:23.560]  I'll get the vaccine.
[1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:24.920]  So that's how they're going to mainline this.
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:28.320]  I think they have to do it in about, I mean, I think, David, I give them two months.
[1:03:28.320 --> 1:03:29.680]  I don't think they have much time after that.
[1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.000]  The coronavirus fears are dying.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:32.800]  The spread is obviously not happening.
[1:03:32.800 --> 1:03:34.360]  The whole hoax has been exposed.
[1:03:34.360 --> 1:03:35.360]  They don't care.
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:36.360]  They still got their media.
[1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:37.360]  They're getting their vaccine lined up.
[1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:41.640]  But you know, you were pointing out how Fauci acts like, oh, we can't have this vaccine.
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:45.080]  He's done it before and they've ruled it out unsuccessfully.
[1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:47.160]  Yeah, 2009, he did it in four months.
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:53.360]  And then also you've got a clip here of a Moderna spokesperson, you know, giving you
[1:03:53.360 --> 1:03:54.360]  the real plan.
[1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:55.360]  Yeah.
[1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:56.360]  Here's their PR clip.
[1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:01.920]  Let's let them explain to you what their diabolical plan is, go ahead, roll the clip.
[1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:04.800]  In many ways, it's digitalizing vaccines.
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:13.200]  We're going from external, very old fashioned approaches to using the body's own machinery
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:15.760]  to do exactly what the body does when it's infected.
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:21.440]  What mRNA gives us is real precision, which allows us to really create vaccines we want
[1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:22.440]  to create.
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.080]  We can do it very, very fast.
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:26.040]  If those pathogens change, we can change it.
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:27.560]  It's highly adaptable.
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:31.840]  And we can get to a scale, a very large scale very quickly.
[1:04:31.840 --> 1:04:39.320]  So that means that in theory, we can get to far more people more quickly with more vaccines
[1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:44.760]  and adjust if we need to adjust because we're producing these vaccines in exactly the same
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:46.200]  way each time.
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:50.240]  It means we can put together vaccines that we might not have been able to put together
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:53.880]  before simply because they weren't compatible before.
[1:04:53.880 --> 1:05:02.400]  It's a whole level, a whole new paradigm compared to existing vaccines, which are slow, unpredictable.
[1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:08.000]  There's a much greater component of art in today's vaccines than mRNA, which is much
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.520]  more engineering and science.
[1:05:09.520 --> 1:05:10.880]  It's actually testing, too.
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:14.560]  The ultimate promise is going after these unmet needs.
[1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.160]  There are so many hundreds of thousands of millions of people suffering from diseases
[1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:21.480]  that vaccines so far cannot prevent.
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:27.120]  I think mRNA vaccines, they offer a tantalizing prospect at going after some of these worldwide
[1:05:27.120 --> 1:05:29.800]  scourges that traditional vaccines haven't solved.
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:36.440]  The idea of reinventing vaccines is incredibly exciting.
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:41.640]  Any other biotech company would be thinking one product, one disease at a time.
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:46.080]  We're able to think how broad can we go, how fast can we go, how big a difference can
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:47.080]  we make.
[1:05:47.080 --> 1:05:49.600]  It's an amazing and unique opportunity.
[1:05:49.600 --> 1:05:55.480]  As a matter of fact, I played Montsef Slaue a couple of years ago talking about how they're
[1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:56.480]  going to roll this out.
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:00.280]  They said, look, we've got at least 77 different diseases, so we've got to rapidly roll things
[1:06:00.280 --> 1:06:01.280]  out.
[1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:04.960]  And then when there's something that gets modified and we have to respond to a pandemic,
[1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.640]  we need to be able to do this rapidly.
[1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.640]  And so this is our program.
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:11.800]  And as you hear these guys, it sounds like they've got, they've really done this.
[1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:13.440]  And you know, they've never have.
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:20.120]  They have never gotten an mRNA vaccine approved for human use, never.
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:21.920]  And this was years ago.
[1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:28.200]  And so this company has been rolling from one overstated promise to the next.
[1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:31.200]  And now they've been given a half billion dollars to roll something out very rapidly
[1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:32.200]  by the end of the year.
[1:06:32.200 --> 1:06:33.320]  And you need to be very concerned about this.
[1:06:33.320 --> 1:06:39.040]  Let me talk again about the, a little bit more detail about how this is all tied together,
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:45.080]  the mechanisms of viruses, of cancer, and of this mRNA vaccine.
[1:06:45.080 --> 1:06:47.200]  They are all very similar.
[1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:49.600]  And that connection should make you very concerned.
[1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:52.800]  When I talk about the different ways that a virus can cause cancer, and again, there's
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:56.560]  a lot of different viruses that are highly associated with cancer.
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:01.680]  The most well-known that many people have is HPB, but there's also hepatitis B and
[1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:07.720]  so forth, these viruses can result in particular types of cancer with a high degree of association.
[1:07:07.720 --> 1:07:09.720]  So how do they cause cancer?
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:16.840]  Again, the viruses are fragments of RNA that your cell, they'll attach themselves to your
[1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:21.160]  cell, and then your cell brings it in and starts to reproduce it in an aberrant way,
[1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:24.680]  in the same way that a cancer cell starts to reproduce.
[1:07:24.680 --> 1:07:27.240]  It kills that cell and then it creates a chain reaction.
[1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:29.880]  So you have direct damage to the DNA.
[1:07:29.880 --> 1:07:31.280]  That's one way that you can cause cancer.
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:35.920]  You can also alter the immune system so that it can't help, it's not able to fight off
[1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:36.920]  cancer cells.
[1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:40.680]  That's another reason that viruses can cause cancer.
[1:07:40.680 --> 1:07:45.360]  You can get chronic inflammation, or you can disrupt the body's normal regulation of cell
[1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:46.520]  division.
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:49.240]  And so understand, viruses are not like bacteria.
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:55.000]  They're not living organisms, they're just RNA fragments like this vaccine.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:56.680]  And viruses can cause cancer.
[1:07:56.680 --> 1:07:59.560]  So is this a risk for this?
[1:07:59.560 --> 1:08:04.960]  Most large companies, pharmaceutical companies even, they're not necessarily known for being
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.400]  that concerned about health effects.
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:08.920]  Most of them have abandoned this approach.
[1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:12.760]  But again, Moderna thinks that they can very rapidly put something out and that's all we're
[1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:16.080]  looking at right now is how fast can it be done?
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:20.320]  Because money is no object, safety is not a concern.
[1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.920]  We're just concerned about the speed at which we can deploy this, right?
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:29.720]  And so when we look at the past history of some of these vaccines, remember that one
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:32.960]  of the most famous ones, you've probably all heard of SV40.
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:37.040]  It was in the polio vaccine, 1955, 1963.
[1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:40.360]  Simeon virus number 40, it was a type of cancer.
[1:08:40.360 --> 1:08:41.480]  They said, oh, sorry about that.
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.680]  They pulled it out after that.
[1:08:43.680 --> 1:08:45.800]  1976, we had the swine flu vaccine.
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:51.640]  It produced a GBS Guillain-Barre syndrome, about one case per 100,000, estimated by the
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:52.640]  CDC.
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.160]  That's probably low.
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:08:58.320]  1998, we had a Hep B vaccine that created multiple sclerosis.
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:00.280]  We had a meningitis vaccine.
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:03.320]  2005, 2008, created Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:08.640]  The swine flu vaccine that we're talking about, Owen and I, that was rushed to market by Fauci
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:12.120]  in 2009, in just four months.
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:16.160]  That resulted in a lot of cases of narcolepsy and some of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:20.520]  So we've had this long history and then in addition to that, you've had a lot of third
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:26.440]  world countries, India, Africa, and others, have accused Bill Gates of sterilization
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:29.920]  and death from HPV, tetanus shots and so forth.
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.880]  That's pretty well documented.
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:37.440]  Hundreds of thousands of people in India that have had bad results from that.
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:42.480]  But when we look at the way that cancer, that vaccines are developed, many of them are developed
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:45.560]  along the lines of immortal cell lines.
[1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:49.040]  One of them, one of the most famous ones, they even did a movie about it.
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:51.320]  The Henrietta Lax Cell Line.
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:55.320]  This is a black woman who at John Hopkins University, they just seem to keep coming
[1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:59.400]  back into these vaccine stories, at John Hopkins University, she came in with cancer.
[1:09:59.400 --> 1:10:03.960]  They misdiagnosed that she died, but they created an immortal cell line.
[1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:08.400]  And as people like to say, if you've had a vaccine, you've probably got a little bit
[1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:11.320]  of Henrietta Lax DNA in your body.
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.360]  They call it the hella line.
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:15.840]  They put her name together there.
[1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:17.720]  And it is a biologic material.
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:23.520]  When you have biologic material grown on these immortal cell lines is grown on a bed of cancerous
[1:10:23.520 --> 1:10:27.400]  cells, because the cancerous cells can continue.
[1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:31.400]  The reason they call them immortal is because they can continue to reproduce.
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:35.840]  They're not like normal cells that stop dividing after a certain number of replications.
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.640]  And when he starts talking about how lucrative this is going to be, first of all, it's going
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.760]  to be fast, right?
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:45.440]  And then secondly, they've got a large array of diseases that they want to deploy this
[1:10:45.440 --> 1:10:47.880]  mRNA vaccine on.
[1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:52.200]  And already, you've got school kids taking over 70 doses of 16 different types of vaccines,
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:53.200]  but that's nothing.
[1:10:53.200 --> 1:10:54.200]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[1:10:54.200 --> 1:11:00.280]  Montsef Slouy, our new vaccines czar, has gone on record with global organizations,
[1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:06.280]  like I said, I've played this on the morning show, talking about how he's identified at
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:13.200]  least 77, and that's not even talking about the pandemics that arise like the novel coronavirus.
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:17.720]  And so when you look at this and you say, well, why are these coronaviruses mutating
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:20.080]  or developing new strains so rapidly?
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:22.760]  Again, it's because they are constant.
[1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:28.760]  It's the RNA that causes mutation, that causes cancer, that causes all these different things.
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:34.120]  So these very adaptations that are happening with the different coronaviruses is because
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:38.760]  when these viruses are replicated by the cells, they're not always replicated in exactly the
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  same way.
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:42.680]  So you get new RNA strains and say, well, that's a different strain.
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:44.760]  And so we have to vaccinate for that.
[1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:47.120]  These things are all tied together.
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:51.920]  This is why this is so dangerous, and it's why they have to roll this out so quickly.
[1:11:51.920 --> 1:11:58.600]  And when we look at the financial aspect of this, Owen, this is very disturbing what they
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:04.760]  have done in terms of the pump and dump in the stock market.
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:09.840]  Again, based on a short test, they said, well, we're going to test 45 people.
[1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:12.720]  They said we found antibodies in eight of them.
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.240]  This has not been peer reviewed.
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:16.040]  It's not been reviewed by anybody.
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:21.080]  Moderna is famous for being very, very close to the chest, very, very secretive about all
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:24.120]  their research, not having produced anything.
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:30.480]  And as Alex was talking about this other company, actually the name is Tharanus, that individual,
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:35.080]  they operated exactly the same way and eventually she was under criminal investigation.
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.680]  But now these people are running the Operation Warp Speed Vaccine Program.
[1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:44.680]  So just putting two and two together here, folks, they're going to roll out a vaccine
[1:12:44.680 --> 1:12:50.800]  that literally gives you cancer so that they can produce their next vaccine with your cells.
[1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:55.520]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:12:58.920]  The globalists have taken the gloves off, and they've taken the mask off, and they're
[1:12:58.920 --> 1:13:04.120]  like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips, yeah, we're into pedophilia, yeah, we're
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:09.160]  into world government, yeah, you're obsolete, you are non-essential.
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:14.160]  We are shutting your ass down, yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:17.520]  and don't work in industry anymore, you're going to be the service economy.
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:21.880]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:26.920]  obsolete so you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:28.560]  can dictate your life.
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:31.200]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:35.600]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order, and that takes you understanding you
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.840]  were right, and understanding I was right, and getting in people's faces and raising
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:42.800]  the alarm now while you still can.
[1:13:42.800 --> 1:13:44.600]  Now is the time for action.
[1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:51.560]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:56.560]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global, corporatist media and the chai comms
[1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:03.160]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression, in fact we're already into the worldwide depression
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:07.960]  and the death sentence for the third world, but it's critical to understand that the longer
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:11.680]  the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:17.240]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:21.880]  That's what we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:26.600]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:29.000]  They've admitted all of this.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:34.600]  So remember how does infall wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:39.520]  to predict things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:44.480]  their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary, but denying it and letting
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.480]  them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[1:14:47.480 --> 1:15:06.880]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:12.000]  You know, looking at this from a layman's perspective, approaching it from common sense,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:20.080]  I have to ask the question, why are these individuals from mode RNA, Moderna, sitting
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:26.800]  here talking so just openly and brazenly about this, like there's some sort of demand, there's
[1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:31.080]  no demand, there's no demand for vaccines, people aren't lining up down the block for
[1:15:31.080 --> 1:15:32.080]  vaccines.
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:35.840]  Hell Bill Gates, Melinda Gates show up in Africa, people hide in their homes because
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:40.080]  they know Bill and Melinda Gates vaccine is going to kill them and that's the only place
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:44.040]  where they're really rolling these out, which is the irony here.
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:50.120]  So they sit here and they project their vaccines onto you like you want them even though there
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.440]  is no demand and they're taking your money to make them and then they're going to take
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:57.920]  your DNA and RNA to make them and then they push them in the third world where there actually
[1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:01.880]  is some disease and outbreak but that's just an excuse that they use to test them.
[1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:06.000]  The people that know about them run and hide when the people in lab coat show up with the
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:10.360]  vaccines, it's sad but that's the truth and then they just sit here and they just do it
[1:16:10.360 --> 1:16:15.360]  all but the story is hiding in plain sight David and we already knew it.
[1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:20.680]  Vaccines cause cancer and they cause autism, period, done, end of story, quit hiding from
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:24.440]  that fact folks but now they're taking it to the next level though, they're taking it
[1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:28.040]  and they're going to say well, we already know the vaccines are causing cancer, we're
[1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:32.600]  not going to tell you that but now we're going to manipulate the new vaccines with the ability
[1:16:32.600 --> 1:16:37.960]  to cause cancer and we're going to call it an immortal cell so now you're constantly
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:42.200]  with your new cancer that they injected into you, you're constantly now producing their
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:46.920]  new proteins and whatever they want to take out of you to produce their next vaccine and
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:51.200]  they sit there and they tell you it like it's a good thing and like you want that.
[1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:55.200]  Their new vaccine is actually a virus itself is really what's happening because when you
[1:16:55.200 --> 1:17:01.560]  take a look at bacteria they are going to multiply, the cells divide and multiply and
[1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:06.520]  so forth but what happens with the virus is it's got this RNA strand, it goes in the cells
[1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:12.440]  reproduce that, that genetic material from the virus, it confuses the cell, the cell
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:17.520]  then rapidly replicates it and it gets destroyed in the process, very much like cancer and
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:21.440]  so that's exactly what they're doing, they're going to turn your body into manufacturing
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:27.000]  their virus, their synthetic virus and part of the things that are being questioned by
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:31.600]  the rest of the medical community one of the reasons why the large companies are not getting
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:37.680]  involved in this is because of the nanoparticles that they use to surround the mRNA fragments
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:42.480]  that they inject into you and those things have their own issue as well but it's very
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:48.600]  similar to the way that cancer is created by genetic mutation when you are hit with
[1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:54.120]  a virus, again it can damage your RNA, it can damage your immune system, it can and
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:58.240]  it doesn't happen in all cases, even when you've got something like HPV that's highly
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:04.160]  associated with cervical cancer and some other types of cancer, there's about 90% of the
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.440]  time they find these RNA fragments in there so it's only about 10% of the viruses that
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:14.080]  cause cancer, there's usually a delay when this happens and so that's another part of
[1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:17.680]  it, they're going to rapidly roll this out, there will be a delay for the effect for this
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:24.960]  to happen just like there is a delay when a virus itself causes cancer and so the reality
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:31.760]  is when we look at this and we look at the push, again you pointed out there's no demand
[1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:38.600]  pull from the public, this is a government push and this is not only the Trump White
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.280]  House, this is the Federal Reserve, you've got Powell saying over the weekend we've got
[1:18:43.280 --> 1:18:48.840]  to have a vaccine so we can reopen the economy, you've got DARPA partnering with Moderna and
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:52.160]  they, so the Pentagon is also pushing this out, the Pentagon is also saying we're not
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.920]  going to have a vaccine until 2021 so you're going to have to stay locked down until we
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:58.800]  get a vaccine, everybody is saying you've got to stay locked down until we get the vaccine
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:02.160]  to get people to beg them for the vaccine.
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:11.360]  And by the way that is such a dangerous precedent David because they know that we can reopen
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:16.440]  tomorrow and there's not going to be a spread and so anybody who goes along with that and
[1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:21.520]  again Trump is kind of going along with it and I get it's like oh yeah he needs the economy
[1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:26.200]  to reopen, that's his biggest election point to vote for so they're kind of like okay well
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:30.120]  we need to reopen it and they say we need the vaccine so go ahead and take the vaccine,
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:35.400]  no there is no spread, I've been to dozens of events, I've been with thousands of people,
[1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:41.440]  we've had Super Bowls, NASCAR events, WW events, sporting events, no spread David, we had,
[1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:46.880]  we had in Florida we had a Super Bowl, we had Spring Break, hundreds of millions of
[1:19:46.880 --> 1:19:53.040]  people in Florida during this deadly pandemic, no spread, there is no spread it's all a lie.
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:57.840]  That's right and so you have to push back against this psychological control and President
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:02.240]  Trump is being given this false choice, you either find a cure that's why he's talking
[1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:06.720]  about other things like HCQ, you either find a cure, well HCQ vaccine, I don't care just
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:10.440]  do it quickly so we can get the economy open, that's not the way to look at this, you got
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:16.080]  to look at this and say we have to open up the economy at warp speed, not get a treatment
[1:20:16.080 --> 1:20:21.880]  at warp speed, we got to restore the constitution at warp speed, we've got to do that quickly,
[1:20:21.880 --> 1:20:29.520]  we have to as a population from the grassroots up folks, we have to rejoin or die, go back
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:34.120]  to the meme that Franklin put together, the chopped up snake, that's what's happened to
[1:20:34.120 --> 1:20:40.000]  our society, they're trying to atomize us, chop us into fragments and we will die unless
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:46.800]  we can rejoin as a society, as a community, as an economy, we have to join together and
[1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:51.760]  we have to do that rapidly, that's what has to be done rapidly, not deploying a vaccine,
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:57.080]  not even coming up with a treatment rapidly, we have to pull this back together and the
[1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:02.840]  thing that concerns me is the fact that you have all these different groups that are pressuring
[1:21:02.840 --> 1:21:06.920]  President Trump, you have the military industrial complex, you've got DARPA, you've got Fauci
[1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:11.480]  and Birx and you've got the Federal Reserve, Chairman, all of these people are saying we've
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:17.160]  got to have a vaccine, this bogus information that came out of Moderna that caused a spike
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:21.760]  in the stock market, everybody who is investing in the stock market, all the bankers and so
[1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:25.680]  everybody that all the money is out there waiting for a vaccine, as long as they can
[1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:31.720]  get any kind of positive information about Moderna's vaccine or about Remdesivir from
[1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:37.800]  Gilead, that causes a surge, a momentary surge in the stock market but it's not real
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:43.960]  and this stuff is very dangerous and the real thing that is being killed is our society,
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:48.600]  our communities, our lives, our liberty, our constitution and that's what we've got to
[1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:54.080]  restore very rapidly, this is a false dichotomy, it's a Hegelian dialectic, it's a manipulation
[1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:59.600]  and you know, when we look at this and I look at the way this stuff is set up, my background
[1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:07.720]  is really in computers and I'm looking at the DNA and the RNA and the mRNA, the messenger
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:13.440]  RNA, it kind of reminds me of higher level code compilers and the assembler code and
[1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:17.080]  so forth, that's kind of the analogy that I look at and I'm reminded about the fact
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:22.200]  that this model that destroyed the world that came out of the Imperial College of London
[1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:29.000]  was based on perhaps the worst software that was ever produced by mankind, I mean this
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.480]  is a model that every time that they would give it the same input and it would give them
[1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:38.280]  a radically different output, now you want to be able to run randomized inputs so that
[1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:41.400]  you see what's going to happen for various scenarios, we're not talking about that,
[1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:47.320]  we're talking about software that was so messed up, so buggy that they would get a different
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:50.840]  answer with exactly the same input and the idiots when they were questioning about it
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:56.280]  by Edinburgh University, they said well run it on a slower computer, they said that shouldn't
[1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:01.720]  change it, these people are so computer illiterate and yet Fauci and Berks, the people that Trump
[1:23:01.720 --> 1:23:08.120]  referred to as two very smart people, they are the ones who shop that computer output
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:14.200]  from that garbage, it was Fortran, Fortran, 60 years ago that was written, 40 years ago
[1:23:14.200 --> 1:23:19.520]  it was outdated, I had a job that was offered to me to work on something that was a legacy
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:24.040]  program written in Fortran, I said absolutely not 40 years ago and yet that's what these
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:28.080]  people who are supposed to be the cutting edge state of the art, this is why you should
[1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:31.560]  be very concerned about this, these people who are still writing computer models and
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:37.640]  Fortran now want to manipulate the software in your body, that's what you should be very
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  afraid of.
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:43.440]  And by the way, the coronavirus models that they wrote were never meant to be accurate,
[1:23:43.440 --> 1:23:47.360]  they were meant to be hysterical to collapse the economy, the exact same thing is done
[1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:51.920]  with climate change models, it's the exact same thing.
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:56.800]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I told folks going back three months ago,
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:00.440]  I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus, I'm worried
[1:24:00.440 --> 1:24:04.680]  about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted that a chain
[1:24:04.680 --> 1:24:08.760]  reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:12.040]  ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:16.400]  So I hope Trump with his initiatives can clean this up and fix it but with the election fraud
[1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:20.760]  and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going
[1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.720]  on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years, they're
[1:24:25.720 --> 1:24:30.240]  in easily totable bags, it's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.200]  off to be ready and it funds the InfoWars.
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:37.960]  So we have storeable food available again, InfoWarsTour.com or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:41.600]  but whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:46.360]  on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient, get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:50.080]  right now while you still can.
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:56.760]  InfoWars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom but worldwide Maverick
[1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:57.760]  spirit.
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:02.840]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars or the researchers or the journalists, it's
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.840]  you the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena and it's the
[1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:13.560]  amazing guests and individuals that we interviewed that make InfoWars so special because we're
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:16.560]  not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:21.200]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment
[1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:25.360]  of talking points that are put out by the Council on Fun Relations, the Bilderberg Group,
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:27.800]  the Davos Group and other club lists.
[1:25:27.800 --> 1:25:33.960]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans,
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  poor humans, by humans.
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:40.360]  Not a world where the establishment, hate themselves, protect their hate onto us and
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:43.400]  decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:47.560]  We're excited to know that InfoWars has your support and I want to thank you all for being
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.720]  pro-human and pro-God.
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:55.400]  What InfoWars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:26:00.640]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:08.000]  This is the battle for the future of humanity and now open world government is being established
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.760]  with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:17.160]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.880]  You must decide which side you're on.
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:24.440]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:28.760]  into misery, destruction and finally death.
[1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:33.240]  This is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:35.760]  The delusions must end now.
[1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:41.320]  InfoWars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[1:26:41.320 --> 1:26:45.040]  The people that are aware of it will decide to join it out of fear.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:46.040]  They are truly fools.
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:53.000]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:27:11.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:28.480]  You know I think it's a paradox actually David because Trump's greatest strength in
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:32.600]  some ways is his patience but it's also his greatest weakness.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:38.640]  You can't have patience with an enemy of America when you're the president and I feel like
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:40.520]  that's kind of what's going on right now.
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:46.960]  I think his greatest weakness is he's never been focused on liberty.
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:50.920]  My problem with Trump when he was running was the fact that he embraced torture.
[1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:55.840]  Torture is not only an ethical, it's not only a war crime but it also is not pragmatic.
[1:27:55.840 --> 1:27:56.840]  They're very...
[1:27:56.840 --> 1:27:57.840]  Well we're all being tortured now.
[1:27:57.840 --> 1:27:58.840]  Yeah exactly.
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:05.680]  The very data that was used for the fake weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a product
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:09.600]  of torture and when people found out, people in the Pentagon White House found out about
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:13.600]  the data that said we've been had and the person who covered up for that, who pushed
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:18.880]  that through was Gina Haspel that Trump made the CIA director and so we had torture that
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:22.000]  produced the weapons of mass destruction that got us into the war with Iraq and now we've
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:28.600]  got scientists quote unquote like Fauci and Birx and these idiots at the Imperial College
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:34.840]  of London torturing the data to get the answers that they want, inflating the data, reeking
[1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:39.400]  the data, presuming that people have died from COVID when they haven't even tested them.
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:40.400]  They don't even...
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:41.400]  They're just...
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:45.120]  They're putting the numbers out and we get the counts out there that say look at this,
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:48.320]  it's going to go over 100,000 and so forth and say we told you it's going to go over
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:49.320]  100...
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:51.320]  Well of course, they're just making this stuff up.
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:54.480]  Yeah, they manipulated the data like you were talking about with just like the climate
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:55.480]  change models.
[1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:56.480]  Yeah.
[1:28:56.480 --> 1:28:57.480]  And you know...
[1:28:57.480 --> 1:29:00.040]  And here's the other thing too because this has been stuck in my crawl.
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:06.200]  We've been in the Middle East with troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and Iran but the enemies
[1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:08.280]  of America are in America folks.
[1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:12.600]  They're in the halls of Congress, they're at these academic institutions, they're at
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:18.200]  the NIAI, I mean they're here, like they're here, they're not in the Middle East in a
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:23.240]  cave, they're not the slums of Iraq, they're right here folks, they're on TV every day.
[1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:26.060]  And so it's very frustrating but you know, I think what it's going to be interesting
[1:29:26.060 --> 1:29:29.240]  to see because Trump's taking hydroxychloroquine, he said it the other day, the media said
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:30.880]  you're basically going to die now Trump.
[1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:34.280]  Well he's not going to die, he's not going to get COVID either so it'll be interesting
[1:29:34.280 --> 1:29:37.920]  to see how they do that but what we really need and here's the danger and you were getting
[1:29:37.920 --> 1:29:43.840]  into this and let's get back into this David, you know, the beauty of the free market is
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:47.200]  the danger of the free market and that's why I'm just a total free market.
[1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:50.520]  In the free market you can be a communist, you can be a communist free market, you can
[1:29:50.520 --> 1:29:53.960]  go start a little commune and have your little communist thing and guess what, that doesn't
[1:29:53.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  affect me.
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:58.080]  I can be a free market capitalist but the danger is guess what, there's going to be
[1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:01.800]  people that want to sell you a dangerous vaccine and a deadly vaccine and they're going to
[1:30:01.800 --> 1:30:06.560]  use marketing tactics to do it but if it's a free market I still have the conscious
[1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:12.080]  choice to say no and that's fine, that's the dangers and the beauties of the free market.
[1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:16.560]  They're eliminating the free market now David in the name of a fake viral outbreak.
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:21.320]  Yeah and one of the things that you has been suggested by some individuals is like look,
[1:30:21.320 --> 1:30:25.640]  if they're going to come at you with a mandatory vaccine, one of the things you might be able
[1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:30.160]  to do short term is to produce a document and there's some various forms of this out
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:37.080]  there says, you know, I want you to sign this document doctor or nurse saying that you are
[1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:41.760]  going to indemnify me against any injury that is caused by this vaccine and of course they're
[1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:42.760]  not going to do that.
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:46.880]  Yeah like can you imagine that somebody is sitting over you with a needle like Bill
[1:30:46.880 --> 1:30:52.840]  Gates like, hey, do you give me, do you sign this waiver before I inject you?
[1:30:52.840 --> 1:30:55.920]  You're sitting there like, where's the door?
[1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:00.320]  Well, you know, and this is why the key thing is it's about force, it's not really about
[1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:01.320]  authority.
[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:06.000]  There really isn't any authority in the Constitution for a mandatory vaccine, Alan Dershowitz is
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:10.560]  just blowing excrement at you.
[1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:14.880]  We've had in the past, we've had the Supreme Court with the Dred Scott decision saying
[1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:18.040]  you got to send the slave that escaped back to the master.
[1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:23.880]  We've had the Supreme Court in 1915, about five, about 10 years after that case that
[1:31:23.880 --> 1:31:27.560]  Alan Dershowitz was talking about where they told a guy, yeah, you got to get a vaccine
[1:31:27.560 --> 1:31:28.560]  in Massachusetts.
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:33.280]  I don't know what the thing was, if it was smallpox or whatever it was in 1905.
[1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:39.960]  But nevertheless, 10 years later, we had the Supreme Court sent a film producer to jail
[1:31:39.960 --> 1:31:46.080]  for 10 years and gave him a massive, massive fine because they didn't like the film that
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:47.080]  he produced.
[1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:50.840]  The film was the spirit of 76 and showed the British as bad guys and at that time you had
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:54.360]  Woodrow Wilson trying to get us into World War I on the side of the British.
[1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:58.760]  So they censored it, he put it back together and showed it again and they put him in jail
[1:31:58.760 --> 1:32:01.600]  and they gave him a fine and the Supreme Court said, no, you can do that, there's no First
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:02.600]  Amendment for movies.
[1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:04.160]  How about that, Hollywood?
[1:32:04.160 --> 1:32:06.920]  And that stood for 40 years.
[1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:09.840]  So we've had the Supreme Court be wrong about a lot of things.
[1:32:09.840 --> 1:32:13.480]  And if the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court got it wrong with the 1905 decision, there
[1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:17.040]  is no right to strap you down and to give you a vaccine.
[1:32:17.040 --> 1:32:20.440]  But what we have to understand, I spent a lot of time this morning on the program.
[1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:24.360]  Take a look at a Band-Aid video at the show because we've got a lot of clips that we put
[1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:25.360]  together.
[1:32:25.360 --> 1:32:31.640]  One of them was very powerful, a guy in California who was a Marine, he had taken an oath to
[1:32:31.640 --> 1:32:36.040]  the Constitution and he had big demonstrators in California.
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:39.880]  And at the beginning of the video, you had these guys in full riot gear, I mean body
[1:32:39.880 --> 1:32:46.200]  armor and helmets and trenches and everything and they're pushing young women with a sign
[1:32:46.200 --> 1:32:50.560]  or anything, pushing them off the edge and he gets there with a bullhorn and he says,
[1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:55.520]  I took an oath to the Constitution, you took an oath to the Constitution, let me tell you,
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:32:56.720]  you have to do the right thing.
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:33:00.120]  Are you going to go tell your kids tonight, what did you do today, Daddy?
[1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:03.800]  And you can tell them, well, we beat up this pastor over here on the side, which they had
[1:33:03.800 --> 1:33:04.800]  just done.
[1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:07.480]  He said, is that what you want for your life?
[1:33:07.480 --> 1:33:11.800]  And he talked to them about his Master Sergeant that he hadn't talked to for 10 years and
[1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:17.520]  his Master Sergeant was saying, you follow the Constitution, ethics and morality, trump
[1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:22.280]  the orders from your commanding officer if they're telling you the wrong thing to do.
[1:33:22.280 --> 1:33:28.080]  Even if that commanding officer is the governor or the president, it trumps those orders and
[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:30.380]  we have to get that message out.
[1:33:30.380 --> 1:33:35.240]  We have to have a rise of the oath keepers, we've got sheriffs here and there that are
[1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:39.400]  doing that, we've got police officers here and there that are doing that, Marines that
[1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:40.800]  are talking about that.
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:46.400]  We have to do that because they don't have the authority and they only have the force
[1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:49.320]  if people will submit to that and they still can't do that.
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:55.480]  If the mass of us will not comply, even with people in truncheons, they do not have enough
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:58.280]  people to force us to comply if we refuse.
[1:33:58.280 --> 1:33:59.280]  And that's what I was going to say.
[1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:01.360]  I was just going to add on to that.
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:02.920]  It takes every citizen at this point.
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:03.920]  That's right.
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:07.200]  I mean, because here's the other thing to join or die, join or die.
[1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:10.200]  And the police are going to eventually, I mean, you're going to have some bad cops and
[1:34:10.200 --> 1:34:14.440]  you're going to have some bad eggs and every, you know, any big industry or whatever you
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:15.440]  want to call it.
[1:34:15.440 --> 1:34:18.120]  But the cops are eventually going to come around and do the right thing if they see
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:20.120]  people standing up against this.
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:23.680]  If they see people in mass, it's kind of like they, I had the story right here.
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.920]  They still arrested over 80 people, but there was a huge party over the weekend on beaches
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:32.640]  in Texas called Topless Jeep Weekend, thousands of people down there.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:34.600]  And the cops are kind of like, yeah, we can't really stop it.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:37.200]  They still arrested 80 people, which is ridiculous.
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.680]  All those cops should be, should resign or be fired immediately.
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.200]  Still no spread, by the way.
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:48.320]  But if all of America just said, no, we're reopening, no, we're not wearing masks, no,
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:52.520]  we're not taking the vaccine, then David, that's when they would literally have to come
[1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:56.400]  to your, you know, front door with a gun and force you to do it or, or they lose.
[1:34:56.400 --> 1:34:57.400]  That's right.
[1:34:57.400 --> 1:34:58.400]  And you have to know what your rights are.
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:00.520]  If you don't know what your rights are, they can lie to you.
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:01.520]  They can intimidate you.
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:03.120]  They can gaslight you.
[1:35:03.120 --> 1:35:08.040]  And if your focus is not on the Constitution and Liberty President Trump, they can get
[1:35:08.040 --> 1:35:10.520]  you to do anything to the people.
[1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:15.200]  You have to have that as your center folk, central focus, but so do we.
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:20.200]  And I had Eddie Craig on last a couple of days ago, and he talked about what you can
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:23.800]  do if you're a business owner and they come after you with these fines, understand that
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:28.880]  if there are fines and jail terms associated with that, that they have to give you a jury
[1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:29.880]  trial.
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:34.080]  If you don't make your business license as punishment, they have to give you a hearing.
[1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:37.800]  We have to stand up for our rights or we lose them.
[1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:41.080]  It's very important right now for everybody to stand together, to stand with these business
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:47.240]  owners, to understand that these people are revolting against the Constitution.
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:49.280]  And they're revolting as in disgusting.
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:51.960]  And we cannot allow them to do this to us.
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:54.880]  We cannot sit down and allow this to happen.
[1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:56.320]  We've got to have the pastors.
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:01.720]  We've got to have the oathkeepers who stand up or we're going to wind up with a full on
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.840]  civil war because a lot of us are not going to comply.
[1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:06.840]  We have to get people on our side.
[1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:10.080]  We have to explain to them why this is in their best interest.
[1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:14.400]  And it's in the best interest of President Trump not to force a vaccine on people, just
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:18.640]  like it's in the best interest of Trump and even the Democrats to not try to force gun
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:20.760]  confiscation on people.
[1:36:20.760 --> 1:36:23.400]  And look, it's kind of a fight, fire with fire thing.
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:26.360]  I mean, I would have a real lawyer with you if you want to open your business stuff.
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:29.920]  But even if you don't, I mean, just say your sister's a lawyer.
[1:36:29.920 --> 1:36:30.920]  I'm going to sue you.
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:31.920]  My lawyer's right here.
[1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:34.920]  They don't know the difference.
[1:36:34.920 --> 1:36:35.920]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.200]  They don't have the right anyway.
[1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:41.080]  This whole thing is a giant lie that you have to shut down.
[1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:44.880]  So yeah, say your dog's a lawyer and my dog will sue you.
[1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:49.600]  They don't want to be involved in a lawsuit, but nobody fights back.
[1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:53.960]  Unblock has really been a sleeper product for us, we got it in a few years ago.
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:58.440]  It's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs.
[1:36:58.440 --> 1:37:02.680]  They discovered this more than 30 years ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from
[1:37:02.680 --> 1:37:08.320]  a certain type of quail, that it had an antihistamine effect and people saw their allergies and
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:10.680]  seasonal discomfort knocked way, way down.
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:16.280]  Well, now this is available in the United States, it's proprietary, it has rave reviews.
[1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:20.760]  It's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become
[1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:21.760]  a best seller.
[1:37:21.760 --> 1:37:24.960]  We're very close to selling out pollen block right now.

[1:38:12.240 --> 1:38:14.240]  DNA Force Plus.
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:19.360]  It's got a high quality PQQ CoQ10 and a bunch of other natural ingredients that are known
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:21.840]  to supercharge the effects of that.

[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:53.800]  The United States is not communist China.
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:56.720]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:38:58.600]  We don't blow up churches.
[1:38:58.600 --> 1:39:01.800]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:11.120]  With all of the news, we see the U.N., billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media praising communist China for their response.
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:15.840]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots
[1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:18.520]  controlling people, well then gee, we've got to do that.
[1:39:18.520 --> 1:39:23.320]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:24.320]  virus.
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:27.680]  Well now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[1:39:27.680 --> 1:39:32.840]  People are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[1:39:32.840 --> 1:39:36.800]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:37.920]  power grab.
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:41.960]  The Resistance lives at band.video and m4warstore.com.
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:46.400]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats and then we'll be able to defeat their
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:49.680]  operation that much quicker.
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:52.200]  I'm always excited about m4warstore's live products.
[1:39:52.200 --> 1:39:53.200]  They're amazing.
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.200]  They're cutting edge.
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  You love them.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:56.200]  I love them.
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.280]  It's the globalest onslaught.
[1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:04.880]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:12.640]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:14.960]  And there's another innovation.
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.960]  It's the spray cap.
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:23.160]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:24.480]  it in a really great way.
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:27.760]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:32.600]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes, but I just love it personally
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.880]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:36.680]  So, this is a real innovation.
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.760]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:44.600]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:46.520]  It's so refreshing.
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:52.520]  This is a big winner.
[1:40:52.520 --> 1:41:06.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:08.520]  Welcome back into the Alex Jones Show.
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:11.080]  Owen Schreuer, David Knight with you in studio.
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:13.960]  We've got this segment and the next with some very important news here.
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:15.280]  We're going to break down.
[1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.760]  And then we're going to have an interview with Roger Stone airing coming up in the entire
[1:41:20.760 --> 1:41:24.560]  third hour before John Rappapur takes over for the fourth hour.
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:28.840]  But you know, David, here's the reason why I think what you're about to get into is so
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:36.320]  important, not just for the information value, but sadly, most people hearing this stuff about
[1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:38.600]  vaccines either can't wrap their head around it.
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:42.720]  I mean, heck, it's hard for me to wrap my head around it and I'm in this.
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:45.960]  It's just very complex stuff, or they just can't even believe it.
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:48.560]  It's too out there for them to understand.
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:53.160]  They'll cast off as a conspiracy theory, but when you get into the money aspect, people
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:55.520]  can understand that people can relate to that.
[1:41:55.520 --> 1:41:59.320]  People have kind of seen that play out and you're going to get into that right now.
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:02.600]  But you know, the one thing I really want the audience to understand, which is this
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:04.880]  is why the money is so important.
[1:42:04.880 --> 1:42:07.440]  It's not about them getting rich.
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:11.320]  People get rich doing a bunch of things, scamming you or running a legitimate business.
[1:42:11.320 --> 1:42:16.320]  The problem is they have so much exorbitant wealth without producing anything and they
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:18.920]  use that to control the media.
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:23.320]  There aren't any, in fact, Infowars may be the only media organization that's self-sustaining.
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:27.280]  I mean, literally, it might be one only.
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:32.040]  And so they have all this money and they use it for quote unquote advertising.
[1:42:32.040 --> 1:42:36.760]  And so all these media corporations that need advertising money to run their programs will
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:41.240]  guess who their number one buyer of ads are, big pharmaceutical companies.
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:46.200]  And so talk about the massive money grab that comes along every time they're trying
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:47.200]  to push a vaccine.
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:48.200]  Yeah.
[1:42:48.200 --> 1:42:49.200]  You know what they've been able to do?
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:53.200]  They've been able to raise massive amounts of money on Wall Street with an interesting
[1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:54.200]  narrative.
[1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.800]  And now they've got an interesting narrative to multiply that out.
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:00.120]  And that is the COVID-19 situation.
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:04.480]  You know, we look at this and we look at a con game, right?
[1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:05.480]  It's based on confidence.
[1:43:05.480 --> 1:43:06.800]  That's what a con game is.
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:09.200]  But of course, there's also another kind of con.
[1:43:09.200 --> 1:43:12.240]  That's the conspiracy, criminal conspiracy is going on.
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:15.440]  I'm not saying that they're engaged in a criminal conspiracy, but there's been a lot of people
[1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:18.120]  that have been questioning this country, company for quite some time.
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  As a matter of fact, when you saw this report come out that they said, look, we've released
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:31.660]  partial results of a non peered review test, eight of 45 candidates appear to have generated
[1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:38.080]  a response to this new type of vaccine that sent the stock market soaring.
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.240]  And of course, this guy, Montsef Slouy, who is now the vaccines are picked by Fauci and
[1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:43.240]  Trump.
[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:46.680]  He sold $12 million worth of options.
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:50.040]  People were saying, hey, wait a minute, you left this company, but you still got all these
[1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:51.040]  stock options.
[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:52.040]  You've got a basic conflict of interest.
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:53.960]  And he goes, well, I'll sell it.
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:58.320]  And zero hedge was saying he might be very happy to get rid of those.
[1:43:58.320 --> 1:44:00.280]  And he did it that very day.
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:02.440]  And so he made $12 million off of that boost.
[1:44:02.440 --> 1:44:04.520]  So wait, so let me get this straight.
[1:44:04.520 --> 1:44:08.040]  Big pharmaceutical companies create a drug or a vaccine.
[1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:12.000]  They then push that information out to all the people they advertise on.
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:13.160]  The media covers it.
[1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:14.160]  And then their stocks boom.
[1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:15.160]  Yeah, their stock.
[1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:16.160]  Wow.
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:17.160]  That's amazing.
[1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:19.920]  And then they raise a ton of money, but they still haven't produced anything.
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:21.720]  That's like the Wolf of Pharma Street.
[1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:22.720]  That's right.
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:23.720]  Exactly.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:25.120]  This company's been around for 10 years.
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:30.160]  They haven't produced anything except they have raised massive amounts of cash.
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:34.000]  As the Wall Street Journal pointed out when that first report came out, said be careful
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:41.560]  handling white hot Moderna stock stat, which is a medical publication said vaccine experts
[1:44:41.560 --> 1:44:46.480]  say Moderna didn't produce data critical to assessing COVID-19 vaccine.
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:48.920]  So did they retrace today?
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:49.920]  Perhaps.
[1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:54.840]  Nevertheless, when we take a look at their history, go back and there's been a lot of
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:45:01.440]  comparisons even four years ago to the company that was called Theranos.
[1:45:01.440 --> 1:45:06.800]  And the CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, was the subject of an FBI criminal investigation.
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:11.720]  They claimed to develop a revolutionary blood testing technology.
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:16.320]  It turned out to be as Thrillist put it, total BS.
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:21.520]  And so when you look at this, I said the same types of things are happening now with Moderna.
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:23.120]  You have a lot of hype.
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:28.880]  You have absolutely no scientific papers that are published, no products that are put out.
[1:45:28.880 --> 1:45:33.960]  And you have, as Stat News pointed out, ego ambition turmoil inside one of biotech's most
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:39.320]  secretive startups, and these are the people who have a half a billion dollars that have
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:43.880]  been given to them by Operation Warp Speed to develop this vaccine.
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:45.800]  So we should be very, very concerned about this.
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:52.200]  And again, if we go back and look at this, their approach is to use RNA fragments and
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:58.480]  to have your body reproduce those RNA fragments the same way your body reproduces the RNA
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:00.480]  fragments that we call a virus.
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:03.160]  We know that viruses damage the DNA.
[1:46:03.160 --> 1:46:05.680]  We know that viruses damage the immune system.
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:12.680]  We know that in 10% of the cases, we have viruses, 10% of the viruses cause cancer.
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:14.640]  And that's one of the ways that they do this.
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:19.160]  And so this is a tactic that they admit they say, we can deploy this very quickly.
[1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:25.240]  What they have with this coronavirus vaccine is they're introducing RNA fragments surrounded
[1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:35.400]  by nanotech, essentially it's nanoparticles that are lipid to protect the RNA fragments.
[1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:40.520]  And then once your cells bring that in, your cells start producing, ideally, they start
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:45.880]  producing these spikes that look like the coronavirus, and then your immune system starts
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:51.360]  to produce a reaction to it that would stop that if it sees a real coronavirus.
[1:46:51.360 --> 1:46:56.400]  The question is, why wouldn't we support our immune system?
[1:46:56.400 --> 1:47:01.240]  God gave us a very complicated protection system called the immune system.
[1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:08.560]  And we've got scientists from NIH, from the CDC, talking about how effective things like
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.160]  vitamin C or vitamin D can be.
[1:47:11.160 --> 1:47:16.200]  If you have a deficiency in vitamin D, they said they've already associated that with
[1:47:16.200 --> 1:47:20.040]  a higher risk of negative side effects with coronavirus.
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:25.280]  So if you have a deficiency in that, they've also identified, the NIH said they've identified
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:30.800]  a deficiency in vitamin D with the onset of autoimmune disease, and they said they can
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:36.520]  correct and mitigate a lot of the symptoms of autoimmune disease if they get the levels
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:37.520]  of vitamin D up.
[1:47:37.520 --> 1:47:43.400]  So when we have a deficiency in certain natural things, or even things like zinc that we're
[1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:49.040]  talking about in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine, very natural things that are missing can cause
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:51.080]  your immune system not to operate effectively.
[1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:58.320]  So why wouldn't we try to take a different approach rather than trying to inject RNA that
[1:47:58.320 --> 1:47:59.960]  we don't know what it's going to do to the cells?
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:01.460]  We don't know what it's going to do to the body.
[1:48:01.460 --> 1:48:03.080]  We don't know what kind of damage it's going to do.
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:07.600]  We don't know if it's going to cause cancer like viruses do, because it is a virus in
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  and of itself.
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:11.200]  Instead of doing that, why don't we boost the immune system?
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.720]  But of course, Owen, they will always pull back from these remedies, even though you've
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:20.400]  got the NIH and the CDC saying, yeah, yeah, they agree with the natural health industry
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:22.080]  on these particular issues.
[1:48:22.080 --> 1:48:24.800]  And yet everybody wants to pretend that's not a thing.
[1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:26.240]  We've got to have a vaccine.
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:27.240]  No, we don't.
[1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:28.240]  No, we don't.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:29.880]  Well, I think I can answer your question.
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:33.760]  Why wouldn't we be talking about vitamin D or vitamin C or zinc?
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:38.760]  Well, the answer is obvious, because right now you can go to infowarstore.com and buy
[1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:41.040]  supplements with zinc in them or vitamin D supplements for...
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:42.040]  Pretty cheap.
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:43.040]  It's pretty cheap.
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:44.040]  They're on sale right now.
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:49.400]  One of the things people are really deficient in, iodine leads to all kinds of immune problems.
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:50.400]  Yeah.
[1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:53.600]  So you can go get iodine, nascent iodine, infowarstore.com, very cheap.
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.160]  That's why they don't want you to know about these things, because we can sell you iodine
[1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:03.240]  at a very affordable price, very high quality iodine at infowarstore.com.
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.120]  You can then get it for an affordable price.
[1:49:06.120 --> 1:49:09.520]  The person that wants to distribute that can also create their own business.
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:12.560]  But with vaccines, I mean, this is the incredible thing, David.
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:17.200]  And I'm almost not even believing this, but this is how it goes.
[1:49:17.200 --> 1:49:23.680]  The vaccine companies make billions of dollars essentially selling their vaccines, and it's...
[1:49:23.680 --> 1:49:30.560]  It all goes to the hospitals and the insurance companies, but on the outset of it though,
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.840]  they don't even have to fund their own research.
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:35.880]  They don't even have to fund their own development of these things.
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:40.640]  They get taxpayer funded grants and all these programs.
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:43.520]  So it's like, it's already a billion-dollar industry.
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:45.480]  They don't even fund themselves.
[1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:51.080]  That's like saying, you know what, Jeff Bezos, which we already do bail Bezos out, but it's
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:53.920]  like, you know what, Bezos, you're worth billions of dollars.
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:57.120]  Let's just give you some money so you can make Amazon even bigger.
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:58.920]  Screw the billions you already have.
[1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:02.760]  Just here's some government cash, make Amazon even bigger.
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:04.560]  That's what we're doing with these vaccine manufacturers.
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:07.240]  Hey, you already got billions of dollars.
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:09.920]  You know, don't even worry about manufacturing your own vaccine.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:12.920]  Here's some government money that you can use that to manufacture your vaccine.
[1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:14.360]  Well, and they don't have any liability.
[1:50:14.360 --> 1:50:21.640]  If they harm anybody, of course, if Fauci was there in 1986, he came into the NIH and
[1:50:21.640 --> 1:50:27.640]  he was head of the division that he is right now where they focus on vaccines.
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:32.000]  He was there with Reagan when they gave legal immunity to the vaccine companies.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:38.560]  So if by design or even by manufacture, they harm you with their product, they don't have
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:39.560]  any liability.
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:42.440]  I mean, nobody else has any kind of a business model like that.
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:46.040]  I mean, you can make a bicycle and you would have liability if you hurt somebody with a
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:48.400]  bicycle, but not these guys.
[1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:52.800]  And so the pharmaceutical companies, if you look at their, you know, their combined revenue,
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:56.680]  it's more than twice what the media and entertainment revenue is.
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:51:01.480]  So obviously they can own the media and look at all the commercials that you see when you
[1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:02.880]  watch mainstream media.
[1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:03.880]  They own them.
[1:51:03.880 --> 1:51:06.680]  They can buy, you know, they can buy these people.
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:11.240]  They can buy the time to push their drugs and to make sure these guys lay off of them.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:13.360]  And that's why no one in the media can ever cover it.
[1:51:13.360 --> 1:51:17.160]  And by the way, you know, this is like, if you're a weatherman, David, and let's say
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:20.400]  you're, you also own a weather shed company.
[1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:23.960]  And so you go on air every night, there's going to be a massive tornado.
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:28.480]  You need to shelter in your weather shed that's buried underground and every night, tornado,
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:31.240]  tornado, and then there's never a tornado and then they find out, wait a second, this
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:34.440]  guy's selling storm shelters, making millions of dollars.
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:38.800]  It's Fauci, that's Gates, that's what they're doing.
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:42.880]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided beetroot has been used for hundreds of years

[1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:48.320]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:51.520]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:52.520]  The safety.
[1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:53.520]  The delusion.
[1:52:53.520 --> 1:52:59.360]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety.
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:05.160]  Movies and partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other
[1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:06.160]  people.
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:09.680]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[1:53:09.680 --> 1:53:12.640]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states.
[1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:16.880]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:22.640]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interest and were infiltrated
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:25.640]  by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:31.320]  We are repeating that again today, compliance, and going along with this system leads to
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:33.800]  absolute bondage.
[1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:37.880]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom, and Info Wars has had great victory thanks
[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:43.520]  to your support and your prayers.
[1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:53.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's incredible.
[1:53:55.720 --> 1:53:58.400]  There's other developing news stories out there.
[1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:09.960]  Now they're pushing new models with Fauci, saying five million could die if we reopen.
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:12.400]  Unbelievable.
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:18.800]  You've also got Joe Biden about to be totally exposed for his corruption in Ukraine.
[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:19.800]  That's right.
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:25.680]  People in Ukraine are calling for Biden as part of the perpetrator of massive crimes
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:26.680]  that have happened.
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:33.440]  That's coming out of just the news from John Solomon, so just incredible developments there.
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:40.680]  But again, folks, the major stories, they're trying to force a vaccine right now that will
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:48.400]  literally give you cancer so that they can then reproduce without any end their next
[1:54:48.400 --> 1:54:52.680]  wave of vaccines, which you will literally become a factory for.
[1:54:52.680 --> 1:54:54.680]  This is not my words.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:55:02.360]  This is right out of the Moderna model that we've been covering here now for two hours.
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:05.720]  The spread is non-existent, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:11.520]  So when they start talking about models and spreads in the second wave, it's all fake.
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:15.440]  Or they're getting ready to actually hit you with some sort of massive radio frequency
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:21.280]  weapon that interacts with whatever heavy metals are already in you, whether it's the
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:23.480]  food or forced vaccine.
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:26.640]  Otherwise, there is no spread, and it's not the coronavirus.
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:32.280]  But of course, it would be the coronavirus, the crown virus, to crown the New World Order,
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:36.800]  the king of you, making you its slave.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:37.920]  And so that's all rolling out.
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:46.160]  The crimes of Obama, also all being exposed right now as well.
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:53.920]  The fake news media just cannot be a bigger pack of boldfaced liars than you've ever seen.
[1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:59.360]  Democrats are forcing states to remain closed while giving hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.360]  to non-citizens.
[1:56:00.360 --> 1:56:04.680]  It's incredible, folks, and I'll just leave it at this.
[1:56:04.680 --> 1:56:08.600]  The enemies of America are not in a cave in Afghanistan.
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:11.120]  They never were.
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:14.320]  The enemies of America were not in the streets of Iran.
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:16.080]  They weren't in the slums of Iraq.
[1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:19.680]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they were in the halls of Congress.
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:25.000]  They were on television, and they were at some of the biggest news publications in America.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  That's where they are.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:30.800]  That's where they've been, and that's where they will remain until they are properly removed.
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:37.360]  Now, we've got coming up a very important interview with Roger Stone that was done by
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:43.480]  the national file, the great reporters over there, Patrick Halley, Tom Pappert, and we're
[1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:48.800]  going to be airing that coming up here in about three minutes in its entirety for the
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:53.280]  remainder of this hour before John Rappaport takes over.
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:56.600]  But ladies and gentlemen, understand this.
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:01.680]  There are not many, and we were forced into this position, and it turns out being a blessing,
[1:57:01.680 --> 1:57:06.720]  but there are not many news organizations, at least with the scale and scope of Infowars,
[1:57:06.720 --> 1:57:09.160]  that are self-funded.
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:10.560]  We're self-funded.
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:12.800]  You fund us by shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:19.960]  That's a proprietary store that we've created to fund ourselves, and we had a massive sale
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:20.960]  happening last week.
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:26.280]  We were able to extend it one more day, though, just one more day.
[1:57:26.280 --> 1:57:31.440]  That includes the massive sales of 50% off the ultimate krill oil, 50% off Survival Shield
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:39.880]  X2, $100 off the Alexa Pure Breeze air filter, 35% off SuperMail Vitality, the new hand sanitizer
[1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:47.720]  combo pack with the three different fragrances, 50% off, 70% off still the eight-pack power
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:48.720]  sack.

[1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:53.360]  That's basically at cost.
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:57.600]  That's the greatest deal in supplements you'll ever find, 70% off the eight-pack power sack,
[1:57:57.600 --> 1:58:00.520]  50% off DNA Force Plus.
[1:58:00.520 --> 1:58:02.600]  Look into telomeres, very powerful.

[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:21.640]  We do have storeable food still in stock to order.
[1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:26.280]  And then some of the products that are almost sold out, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Bodies, which
[1:58:26.280 --> 1:58:34.160]  is 40% off, Vitamin B12, Ultra 12, 40% off, it's all at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:35.880]  Thank you for making all of it possible.
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:39.360]  Please keep us on air by supporting us by shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:58:39.360 --> 1:58:47.720]  All right, Tom Pappert, Patrick Cowley, Roger Stone, coming up in 60 seconds.
[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:53.920]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020, and within a week or so, many of the best-selling
[1:58:53.920 --> 1:58:57.920]  items that we're selling at InfowarsStore.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:01.800]  In fact, last year I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:05.680]  enough for us people to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:08.560]  But I want you to get the ultimate Creole Oil.
[1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:10.560]  I want you to get Vazo Beats.
[1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:12.720]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:15.280]  I want you to experience X2.
[1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:18.200]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:23.440]  They're all in stock right now, and they're 30% to 60% off.
[1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:28.680]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on
[1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:32.280]  most items in about a week because a lot of the products are getting close to selling
[1:59:32.280 --> 1:59:35.640]  out like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Vazo Beats.
[1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:36.800]  So take action.
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:40.440]  Be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the Infowar.
[1:59:40.440 --> 2:00:05.200]  Get in these great products, and at 4store.com.
[2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:17.000]  Welcome back to National File.
[2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:21.400]  I'm Tom Papert, Editor-in-Chief, here with Senior Reporter Patrick Howley, as well as
[2:00:21.400 --> 2:00:24.480]  the one, the only, the legendary Roger Stone.
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:28.920]  Now, as you know, Patrick has been busy these past few months, really doing what nobody
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:33.640]  else is willing to do, actually speak to Roger Stone and find out what happened.
[2:00:33.640 --> 2:00:38.800]  This attempted deep state takedown of one of President Donald Trump's longest and most
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:40.160]  trusted advisors.
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:42.960]  So Patrick, I'll let you take it away with Roger Stone.
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:46.120]  Roger, it's great to have you here.
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:49.960]  You're, of course, a legend in the field of saving America, and we really appreciate
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:50.960]  your time.
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:56.800]  Well, it's great to be here with National File because, in truth, you are one of a handful
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:01:03.200]  of national media organizations that has accurately covered what has happened to me, the odyssey
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:10.140]  that my family and I have been through for the last roughly two years, and I'm grateful
[2:01:10.140 --> 2:01:11.560]  to have this opportunity.
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:16.760]  As you know, Patrick, the judge in my case gagged me.
[2:01:16.760 --> 2:01:20.480]  I was not allowed to post anything whatsoever on social media.
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:26.160]  I was not permitted to speak about anything relating to my case, the Mueller investigation,
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:30.680]  the Russia investigation, in any public forum whatsoever.
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:33.600]  I doubt the constitutionality of that.
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:36.360]  I also doubted the purpose of it.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:41.080]  The judge's contention was that it would taint the D.C. jury pool.
[2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:45.600]  What could taint the D.C. jury pool more than the Washington Post, whose coverage of my
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:51.600]  trial has been completely and totally dishonest, but has urinated on me virtually every day
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:55.360]  for two years, or CNN, or MSNBC?
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:02:02.160]  So it's great to have the opportunity to tell the people the facts because of the news
[2:02:02.160 --> 2:02:07.920]  blackout and the gag. Most Americans have no idea how flimsy the charges that I was
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:15.960]  ultimately indicted on were, how politicized my trial was, how biased the judge was, how
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:25.160]  corrupted the jury was, and how much prosecutorial misconduct there was in my entire case.
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:30.320]  So I'm glad to have the opportunity to lay it out there for the American people.
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:35.080]  Well, Roger, we hope that we're not going to have to smuggle you some cigarettes in there,
[2:02:35.080 --> 2:02:39.640]  but just know that I am willing to do so if need be, because we want to see you running
[2:02:39.640 --> 2:02:40.640]  the cigarette game.
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:43.760]  We want to make sure you're protected, but it might not come to that because you might
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:46.240]  get a presidential pardon from your old friend Donald Trump.
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:48.600]  Now, let's just start at the beginning here.
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:52.680]  You are going to prison because you would not lie about the president.
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:53.680]  Is that correct?
[2:02:53.680 --> 2:03:00.000]  Yeah. I mean, essentially, after the mainstream media, particularly CNN, but also the New
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.400]  York Times and the Washington Post, said for well over a year, Roger Stone will be indicted
[2:03:06.400 --> 2:03:07.560]  for treason.
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:11.560]  Roger Stone will be indicted for conspiracy against the United States.
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:16.680]  Roger Stone will prove to be the missing link between Russia and the Trump campaign.
[2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:22.160]  Roger Stone will prove to have smuggled emails from Julian Assange and WikiLeaks to the Trump
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:24.280]  campaign.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.640]  None of those things turned out to be true.
[2:03:27.640 --> 2:03:34.320]  The prosecutors went to the number of judges and federal magistrates, charging me not only
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:40.000]  with those crimes, but also cyber crimes such as the receipt and dissemination of stolen
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:48.600]  material, aiding and abetting a felony, accessory to a felony before the fact, wire fraud, mail
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:55.280]  fraud, violation of the foreign campaign contributions ban.
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:04:02.120]  No evidence whatsoever was found of any of those crimes, despite the fact that they conducted
[2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:09.120]  an extraordinarily deep legal, proctological examination of every corner of my life, going
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:13.240]  through two years of emails, text messages, phone calls.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:14.920]  They could find no evidence.
[2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:20.200]  So they basically jerry-rigged this lying to Congress charge.
[2:04:20.200 --> 2:04:26.840]  And even that is ridiculously thin because the items that I'm accused of making misstatements
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:30.720]  about, I had neither intent nor motive.
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:37.640]  In the end, I was convicted of lying to Congress about the Trump campaign's interest in the
[2:04:37.640 --> 2:04:39.320]  WikiLeaks' disclosures.
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:41.720]  Now, that's a perfectly legal activity.
[2:04:41.720 --> 2:04:47.560]  In other words, there was no underlying crime for me to lie about.
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:52.400]  Especially in the American political game, starting in June when Assange announced on
[2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:59.040]  CNN that he had substantial information on Hillary and that it was sensational, wanted
[2:04:59.040 --> 2:05:01.440]  to know what it was he had.
[2:05:01.440 --> 2:05:03.240]  I never found out in advance.
[2:05:03.240 --> 2:05:09.760]  There was never any evidence whatsoever that I knew the source or the content of the WikiLeaks'
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:15.960]  disclosures that came in either July, when I really wasn't paying attention, or in October
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:20.760]  when I didn't want them to be swept under the carpet by the mainstream media.
[2:05:20.760 --> 2:05:27.560]  So yes, I went on my Twitter feed to tease constantly to make sure that whatever it was
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:33.800]  that WikiLeaks had and would disclose would have a devastating effect, and it did.
[2:05:33.800 --> 2:05:37.360]  So these charges were pasted together.
[2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:46.640]  And then, as you know, on January 25th, 6 a.m. in the morning, 29 heavily armed SWAT
[2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:54.840]  gear clad assault weapon-bearing FBI agents arrived in 17 armored vehicles with a government
[2:05:54.840 --> 2:06:01.920]  helicopter overhead, two amphibious units with frogmen pulled up to the canal at the
[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:09.120]  back of my house to serve a warrant for not only my arrest, for a search of the premises.
[2:06:09.120 --> 2:06:13.960]  They brought an enormous battering ram up to the front door, they had a K9 unit, these
[2:06:13.960 --> 2:06:20.600]  very scary looking dogs, and of course I opened the door and I was immediately arrested, and
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:25.240]  then I was frog-marked out in the middle of the street to make sure that the CNN cameras
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:31.640]  that were allowed to set up a tripod 25 feet from the front door were able to catch the
[2:06:31.640 --> 2:06:33.040]  entire thing.
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:39.840]  By the way, tipping a media outlet in advance to the execution of a search warrant is a
[2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:47.480]  felony, which is why to this day the FBI, under Christopher Wray, refuses to hand over
[2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:55.920]  to judicial watch all of their emails between FBI and CNN in the days and weeks before my
[2:06:55.920 --> 2:06:57.420]  arrest.
[2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:04.360]  The whole thing was a show, it was put on to not only vilify me for the American people
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:11.680]  and potentially for a jury, but also to intimidate me, and I would find out later what it was
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:16.000]  they wanted to intimidate me about.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:23.240]  The whole experience is Kafkaesque, it's really extraordinary, because they justified this
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:31.080]  over-the-top Gestapo-style raid on the fact that I was a flight risk, yet three hours
[2:07:31.080 --> 2:07:35.400]  later when I was arraigned in the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, the government
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:40.640]  asked for no cash bond, in other words I was released on my signature, which meant they
[2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:45.640]  never really thought I was a flight risk, they knew I didn't have a valid passport,
[2:07:45.640 --> 2:07:51.920]  they knew I did not own a firearm, even though I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.
[2:07:51.920 --> 2:07:58.520]  I live on a canal, but the truth is I can't really swim, and my face is instantly recognizable,
[2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:00.800]  so where was I going to go?
[2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:04.360]  Then they said, well, if Stone knew we were coming in advance, he might have destroyed
[2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:05.360]  evidence.
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:10.880]  I destroyed nothing, but the media had made it clear for two years I was under investigation,
[2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:17.440]  why would I wait till January of 2019 if I were going to destroy anything?
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:20.040]  Which I did not.
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:25.880]  The special counsel's office spoke to my lawyer on the phone the day before my arrest.
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:30.840]  All they had to do was say we're charging your client, and I would have come in voluntarily,
[2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:38.280]  and I could have saved the taxpayers $1.1 million for this over-the-top raid on my
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:39.280]  home.
[2:08:39.280 --> 2:08:43.800]  If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:47.440]  Roger, I think that's a really important takeaway.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:52.360]  Patrick, we're just getting ready to come up against a break, but when we come back,
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:57.360]  I do want to hear more about how the tainted jury might have impacted it as well as the
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:03.040]  tainted judge, who we now know, of course, is an Obama hack partisan, and I want to deeply
[2:09:03.040 --> 2:09:08.520]  explore this whole idea that the FBI and CNN, well, CNN is basically the propaganda and
[2:09:08.520 --> 2:09:13.880]  media arm of the FBI, which, of course, has been totally disgraced in recent years.
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:18.280]  I'm Tom Papert, editor-in-chief of National File, here with senior reporter Patrick Halley,
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:23.680]  interviewing Roger Stone, a deep state soon-to-be political prisoner.
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:24.680]  Don't go away.
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:25.680]  You are watching National File.
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:33.800]  We'll be right back after the short break.
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:47.320]  Now, it's official.
[2:09:47.320 --> 2:09:52.960]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years,
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:58.200]  and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[2:09:58.200 --> 2:10:02.320]  because we have to track your social distancing, and you're only allowed to have a list of
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.760]  10 people that you visit, and if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:13.360]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:19.760]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now nonessential
[2:10:19.760 --> 2:10:21.000]  and a prisoner.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:24.560]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:26.120]  anti-human group.
[2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:31.400]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their in-game,
[2:10:31.400 --> 2:10:33.600]  which is global depopulation.
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:37.120]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[2:10:37.120 --> 2:10:43.080]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:44.520]  mortal enemy.
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:45.520]  Wake up or die.
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:49.480]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and
[2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:53.760]  listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things, but you notice almost everything
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:56.520]  we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[2:10:56.520 --> 2:11:00.360]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[2:11:00.360 --> 2:11:03.840]  It's like telling somebody, if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:07.920]  little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[2:11:07.920 --> 2:11:08.920]  People don't listen.
[2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:10.360]  They go out and their kids dead in the pool.
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:14.200]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the Third World, the collapse of the First
[2:11:14.200 --> 2:11:15.200]  World.
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.240]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists, and they admit they've
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:21.500]  orchestrated it.
[2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:25.960]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth, and they're teaching us to be more frugal,
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:31.360]  and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[2:11:31.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:38.800]  because it's their operations manual.
[2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:42.840]  I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of
[2:11:42.840 --> 2:12:12.680]  most major institutions, and we've got to stop them.
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:18.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:12:18.120 --> 2:12:30.280]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:32.480]  Welcome back again to National File.
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:35.040]  We are here with Roger Stone and Patrick.
[2:12:35.040 --> 2:12:36.360]  We had to cut you off for a break.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:37.360]  I'll let you continue.
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:42.560]  Well, you know, I think Roger could end up being sort of the Nelson Mandela of saving
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:48.400]  America here, and I think the reason really is because he is possibly headed to prison
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:52.200]  simply because he would not lie about President Donald Trump.
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.480]  Is it true, Roger, that the Mueller team tried to coerce you to lie about the president and
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:12:58.080]  offered you no jail plan?
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:04.440]  Yeah, I think that's actually what this ended up being all about, because the Mueller investigation
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:10.760]  indicted me long, long after they knew there was no Russian collusion, specifically on
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:20.240]  July 24th of 2019, Jeannie Rhee, who headed the prosecution team inside the Mueller organization
[2:13:20.240 --> 2:13:21.240]  against me.
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:27.400]  By the way, Hillary Clinton's personal attorney in the Clinton missing email case representing
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:32.640]  the Clinton Foundation, she lied to the judge in that case, telling the judge that all the
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:37.640]  emails had been turned over to the court when, of course, they hadn't, she was also a maxed
[2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:45.080]  out donor to Hillary's two campaigns for president, but of course, Judge Jackson saw no conflict
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:46.880]  of interest in that.
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:55.920]  She proposed to my attorney that if I would come clean, and if I would confess about the
[2:13:55.920 --> 2:14:05.040]  content of some 29 telephone calls between candidate Donald Trump and myself in 2016,
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:10.280]  all of which were over 30 minutes long, she said there were numerous other calls, but
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:17.240]  they were much shorter, that they might be able to see their way clear to recommend no
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:18.240]  jail time.
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:24.720]  Now, this was just prior to the Mueller report being issued, and I suspect they wanted me
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:29.600]  to be the ham in their ham sandwich since they had nothing.
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.080]  It wasn't hard to decide.
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:37.960]  I said no, I should point out that they threatened to issue a superseding indictment to hit me
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:42.760]  with additional fabricated charges, and I still said no.
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:46.320]  I was not going to bear false witness against Donald Trump.
[2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:52.360]  I had said it consistently for a year, and there was no way that I was going to be flipped
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:57.640]  if they thought that I was Michael Cohen, then they had the wrong guy.
[2:14:57.640 --> 2:15:00.280]  That's why I'm looking at a very stiff sentence.
[2:15:00.280 --> 2:15:07.880]  I'm looking at 40 months in a federal prison, two and a half years on probation, supervised
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:12.280]  probation, in which I would be subject to random drug testing.
[2:15:12.280 --> 2:15:18.560]  I think it's 320 hours of community service, and a $25,000 fine.
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:25.440]  I have appealed my conviction, not only because I believe I am not guilty, but because I believe
[2:15:25.440 --> 2:15:33.840]  that my trial was corrupted, and to a certain extent, rigged from the very beginning.
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:38.240]  So you might ask, Stone, you were charged with lying to Congress.
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:48.480]  What about Comey, Clapper, Brennan, McCabe, Strach, Page, Rosenstein, Mueller himself,
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:50.480]  Hillary Clinton?
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:55.640]  All of these people lied to Congress, although they lied about substantive matters, material
[2:15:55.640 --> 2:15:58.800]  matters, but of course, they were never charged.
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:02.080]  The judge would not allow us to use that line of defense.
[2:16:02.080 --> 2:16:05.040]  It was specifically prohibited.
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:08.920]  And then there's the question of prosecutorial misconduct.
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:16.800]  Judge Jackson specifically prohibited me from raising any misconduct by the special counsel,
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:23.880]  the FBI, the Department of Justice, or any member of Congress, Adam Schiff.
[2:16:23.880 --> 2:16:31.360]  So in other words, I was unable to raise any of those things in my defense.
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:34.880]  We doubt the constitutionality of that ruling, by the way.
[2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.440]  Then additionally, I think this is probably the most important point, my entire indictment
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:46.880]  was based on the premise that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by the
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.600]  Russians and that the information had been transferred to WikiLeaks.
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:54.600]  I wanted the opportunity to disprove that.
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:17:01.320]  I wanted to bring in forensic evidence and expert testimony from former NSA officials
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:08.000]  like Bill Binney and former CIA officials like Ray McGovern to prove definitively that
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:11.160]  nobody hacked the DNC.
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:15.200]  That was the underlying premise of my indictment.
[2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:19.120]  Judge Jackson denied us that opportunity.
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:26.320]  We actually got the FBI to admit in discovery that they never inspected the servers of the
[2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:36.080]  DNC and that they relied entirely on a draft redacted report from CrowdStrike, a Democrat
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:41.040]  connected IT firm for that assertion, for that conclusion.
[2:17:41.040 --> 2:17:44.840]  Jesse Waters covered this yesterday on Fox.
[2:17:44.840 --> 2:17:52.080]  The government, specifically Jonathan Cravis, came in with a surreply saying, Stone is
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:53.440]  incorrect.
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:59.080]  We do have additional proofs that the Russians hacked the DNC, but we don't have to show
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:00.320]  it to you.
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:01.920]  That was a fraud upon the court.
[2:18:01.920 --> 2:18:05.400]  Mr. Cravis has defrauded the court in that filing.
[2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:07.600]  We'll hear more about that down the road.
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:13.440]  But again, Judge Jackson would not allow us to mount that defense.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:19.520]  So I was not allowed to talk about the misconduct of anyone in the government.
[2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:26.120]  I now believe almost definitively that the Mueller prosecutors shared the fruits of their
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:31.920]  search of my computer messages, my emails, with Adam Schiff and that Adam Schiff fashioned
[2:18:31.920 --> 2:18:39.000]  a series of gotcha questions, none of which were material, none of which masked any underlying
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:43.240]  crime in an effort to entrap me.
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:46.640]  But I was unable to raise that question at trial.
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:52.320]  And of course, Adam Schiff is immune to being summons to trial as a member of Congress.
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:55.360]  It was very, very frustrating.
[2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:02.040]  The trial was essentially set up as a Soviet-style show trial, a kangaroo court.
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:08.600]  It would be like going to a prize fight with both hands tied behind your back.
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:12.480]  And it is an experience that no American should have.
[2:19:12.480 --> 2:19:16.640]  When we get to the other side, I'm going to tell you about some of the shocking things
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:22.920]  that happened at trial because I believe that every government witness lied under oath.
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:29.480]  I believe the prosecutors suburned perjury at my trial on several occasions.
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:36.440]  And if we end up going to appeal, all of these matters are preserved and would be opened
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:37.440]  back up.
[2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:38.440]  In the meantime...
[2:19:38.440 --> 2:19:43.360]  And Roger, this man, Henry Greenberg, the Russian, was actually an informant for Robert
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:44.360]  Mueller's FBI.
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:46.760]  And this is the guy who tried to set up a meeting with you?
[2:19:46.760 --> 2:19:47.760]  Yeah.
[2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:52.480]  I was definitely, around the same time the FBI was approaching Carter Page and George
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:59.840]  Papadopoulos, they sent an undisputed FBI informant in to try to compromise me.
[2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:02.840]  Fortunately for me, I didn't take debate.
[2:20:02.840 --> 2:20:04.840]  I turned him down flat.
[2:20:04.840 --> 2:20:09.920]  The only publication in America that has covered this is the national file.
[2:20:09.920 --> 2:20:15.120]  Well, Roger, part of the reason I was so interested is because this doesn't sound like a trial
[2:20:15.120 --> 2:20:16.120]  at all.
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:18.560]  It sounds like a witch hunt from the 1600s.
[2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:20.280]  And I think you said something very important.
[2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:24.720]  If this can happen to you, who's to say this can't happen to me or Patrick or the viewers
[2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:25.720]  at home next?
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:30.560]  So when we come back, I want to hear more about just how insane this trial was.
[2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:34.080]  If you can even call it such a thing and what they were able to get away with.
[2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:35.080]  Don't go away.
[2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:44.320]  This is National File with Roger Stone.
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:49.000]  What Info Wars has been able to do thanks to your support and your prayers and your word
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:54.240]  of mouth has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[2:20:54.240 --> 2:20:58.040]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[2:20:58.040 --> 2:21:05.360]  And now open world government is being established with an end game to depopulate the planet.
[2:21:05.360 --> 2:21:10.800]  Now the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:13.400]  You must decide which side you're on.
[2:21:13.400 --> 2:21:18.280]  Living in denial, having mastoccal syndrome, Mert Elklissens will only deliver you into
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:21.720]  misery, destruction, and finally death.
[2:21:21.720 --> 2:21:26.880]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[2:21:26.880 --> 2:21:29.640]  The delusions must end now.
[2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:34.960]  Info Wars was correct about it all and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:38.080]  Most people that are aware of the new will order decide to join it out of fear.
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:40.080]  They are truly fools.
[2:21:40.080 --> 2:21:43.400]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[2:21:43.400 --> 2:21:48.280]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[2:21:48.280 --> 2:21:53.000]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:54.500]  then it finally dies.
[2:21:54.500 --> 2:21:58.720]  She said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:03.320]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[2:22:03.320 --> 2:22:08.120]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole, and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering,
[2:22:08.120 --> 2:22:12.440]  talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:15.320]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:16.840]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[2:22:16.840 --> 2:22:22.480]  This has been done by design and the UN, the Chai Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:25.560]  it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[2:22:25.560 --> 2:22:30.240]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:36.360]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[2:22:36.360 --> 2:22:37.360]  We tried to stop it.
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  We tried to fight it.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:45.360]  You guys have said you want to wreck America and the world and now you've done it.
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:46.360]  Congratulations.
[2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:50.200]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I've told folks the one back three months
[2:22:50.200 --> 2:22:53.760]  ago, I'm not buying horrible food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:57.800]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse and now it's admitted
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:01.800]  that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:05.600]  farms and ranches across the United States and it's even worse in the third world.
[2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:09.400]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[2:23:09.400 --> 2:23:13.960]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:19.280]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[2:23:19.280 --> 2:23:21.280]  They're in easily totable bags.
[2:23:21.280 --> 2:23:25.080]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready and it funds
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:26.080]  the InfoWars.
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:29.720]  So we have storeable food available again, InfoWarsTour.com or call toll-free, triple
[2:23:29.720 --> 2:23:33.400]  A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine, whatever you do, get prepared and get ready
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:35.800]  because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:37.880]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[2:23:37.880 --> 2:23:46.880]  Get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com right now while you still can.
[2:23:46.880 --> 2:24:02.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:02.840 --> 2:24:08.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:19.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:19.240 --> 2:24:20.240]  Welcome back.
[2:24:20.240 --> 2:24:21.240]  This is National File.
[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:23.000]  We are joined by Roger Stone.
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:27.800]  So Roger, in the last segment, you unpacked a bit of this show trial, this absolute kangaroo
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:33.240]  court that you were subjected to over the course of two years, and it sounds absolutely
[2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:36.360]  insane, but I understand that's not the entire story.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:42.280]  Tell us a little bit more about what the prosecution was allowed to get away with by this lovely
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:43.280]  judge.
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:49.760]  Well, we learned something really shocking last week when the House Intelligence Committee
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:57.160]  declassified the testimony of everyone who testified before that body, including my testimony,
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:00.240]  which I invite people to read.
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:05.760]  They declassified the testimony of Steve Bannon, and the problem with that is that Steve Bannon's
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:12.720]  under oath testimony to the House Intelligence Committee directly and completely contradicts
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:15.960]  his testimony on the stand at my trial.
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:19.760]  It was kind of a surprise witness for the government.
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.520]  He swept into the courtroom dressed all in black, kind of looking like a disheveled and
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:28.400]  fat Johnny Cash, and he completely lied.
[2:25:28.400 --> 2:25:33.520]  In other words, he told the House Intelligence Committee specifically that he never had any
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:41.440]  conversation with me regarding WikiLeaks or Julian Assange on any occasion whatsoever.
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:48.200]  But on the stand in my trial, he said that we talked about it numerous times on the phone,
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:55.120]  and that he considered me the campaign's access point regarding WikiLeaks, which was certainly
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:56.120]  news to me.
[2:25:56.120 --> 2:26:01.920]  Now, I didn't speak to Steve Bannon all that often during the 2016 campaign, but the few
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:09.880]  times I did, it was about the issue of getting the women victims of Bill Clinton out front.
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:14.840]  Because it wasn't just Bill Clinton's serial sexual assaults on women.
[2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:20.040]  It was more importantly, Hillary's efforts to intimidate and bully and silence those
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:23.560]  women that I thought would be important to women voters.
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:29.800]  You can't be an advocate for women if you are bullying and threatening and intimidating
[2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:30.800]  women.
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:35.960]  I had written an entire book on this subject, The Clinton's War on Women, which you can
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:41.480]  still get at StoneColdTruth.com store if you want to sign copies.
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:47.520]  You know, it shocked me because it means that either Mr. Bannon committed perjury before
[2:26:47.520 --> 2:26:52.360]  the House committee, the exact thing that I'm charged with, or he committed perjury
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:55.720]  at my trial, which would be shocking.
[2:26:55.720 --> 2:26:57.600]  Will he be held responsible?
[2:26:57.600 --> 2:26:59.560]  I have no idea.
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:02.080]  But this would happen again and again.
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:08.680]  Rick Gates, who committed the same crimes for which Paul Manafort got seven years, he
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:16.640]  testified at my trial that he overheard a conversation between Donald Trump and I in
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:24.400]  a car on the way to LaGuardia Airport, although he said he couldn't hear the actual conversation.
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:27.240]  He was certain that it regarded WikiLeaks.
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:29.360]  He claimed it was in the first week of August.
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:34.280]  That doesn't even make sense from a timeline point of view.
[2:27:34.280 --> 2:27:36.640]  He says he couldn't hear the conversation.
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:39.800]  He said there were two secret service agents in the car.
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:44.920]  The government produced neither one of them to corroborate this story.
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:52.360]  It simply never happened, but Mr. Gates got a 45-day sentence rather than the seven years
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  that Manafort was sentenced to.
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:01.680]  He was also able to skip out on the nonpayment of taxes on millions of dollars that he had
[2:28:01.680 --> 2:28:04.560]  embezzled from his partner Manafort.
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:11.080]  And then, of course, there's Randy Krediko, who we know definitively three separate witnesses
[2:28:11.080 --> 2:28:17.760]  went to the grand jury and confirmed for the grand jury that Krediko himself, the nutty
[2:28:17.760 --> 2:28:24.640]  progressive impressionist radio talk show host, who's the one who told me that whatever
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:31.960]  Assange had was big and it was coming in October, Krediko had told three witnesses to their
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:37.840]  face and in writing, which was provided to the grand jury, that he was my source, yet
[2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:41.840]  those exculpatory witnesses were entirely ignored.
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:48.160]  And the government claimed, without ever putting up any proof whatsoever, that Dr. Jerry Corsi
[2:28:48.160 --> 2:28:53.400]  was my source, which he was not and which he denies to this day.
[2:28:53.400 --> 2:29:01.080]  And of course, had I had a fair trial, had I had a fair shot, I think I might have disproved
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:02.480]  those things.
[2:29:02.480 --> 2:29:09.200]  But to be very clear, this jury was made up entirely of Democrats.
[2:29:09.200 --> 2:29:14.080]  Juan Williams on the five on Fox said, well, there were Trump supporters on Stone's jury
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:15.920]  and they voted to find him guilty.
[2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:18.960]  No, I'm not allowed to tell you who was on the jury.
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:22.520]  That information is sealed, but I can tell you the character of it.
[2:29:22.520 --> 2:29:24.680]  There were no military veterans.
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:27.480]  There were no Republicans.
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:29.440]  There were no blue collar workers.
[2:29:29.440 --> 2:29:33.240]  There was no one with less than a college education.
[2:29:33.240 --> 2:29:38.120]  There were activist Democrats on my jury.
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:40.480]  I'm not sure that Perry Mason could have gotten me off.
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:44.680]  I'm not sure Clarence Darrow could have gotten me off.
[2:29:44.680 --> 2:29:49.040]  But after the trial, it was not shocking when I was convicted.
[2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:55.560]  The media mocked me for reading from a Bible while we were waiting for a decision.
[2:29:55.560 --> 2:30:01.720]  But it was not shocking that I was found guilty on all charges, but after the trial, we would
[2:30:01.720 --> 2:30:08.040]  learn that the jury for a woman whose name is Tomika Hart, I'm not outing her, she outed
[2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:18.640]  herself on CNN, had in 2019 posted attacks on me by name starting on the day I was arrested
[2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:23.600]  and subsequently on Twitter and Facebook.
[2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:30.960]  Her MO was to place something on Facebook and then put the Facebook link up on Twitter.
[2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:35.800]  Now, that was the basis for a motion for a new trial.
[2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:40.840]  She also attacked Donald Trump throughout 2019, but the judge had already ruled that
[2:30:40.840 --> 2:30:46.120]  your political views had no bearing on your ability to be an unbiased juror.
[2:30:46.120 --> 2:30:50.360]  I don't agree with that, but that is evidently the law.
[2:30:50.360 --> 2:30:54.080]  But it was still the basis for a motion for a new trial.
[2:30:54.080 --> 2:30:58.840]  It wasn't just her attacks on the president, even though she called him a racist and said
[2:30:58.840 --> 2:31:04.520]  that all of his supporters are racist, that would presumably include me, but it was the
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:06.800]  personal attacks on me.
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:14.080]  Shockingly, Judge Jackson held in her opinion that that did not constitute bias against
[2:31:14.080 --> 2:31:19.000]  me and that I was not entitled to a new trial.
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:24.640]  Several experts from Jonathan Turley on the left to Judge Andrew Napolitano on the right,
[2:31:24.640 --> 2:31:30.160]  I would say Alan Dershowitz in the center somewhere, all said that that was ridiculous.
[2:31:30.160 --> 2:31:37.400]  The president himself said this was a tainted jury and this juror had misled the court in
[2:31:37.400 --> 2:31:39.240]  order to get on the jury.
[2:31:39.240 --> 2:31:41.000]  She knew fully who I was.
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.040]  She had an animus against me.
[2:31:43.040 --> 2:31:47.480]  She had posted it and the charge that your lawyer should have known that, there was no
[2:31:47.480 --> 2:31:53.840]  way for them to know it because her social media platforms were on private settings
[2:31:53.840 --> 2:31:56.800]  during and prior to the trial.
[2:31:56.800 --> 2:32:04.920]  After the trial, she would completely delete the Facebook page that she had had since 2008
[2:32:04.920 --> 2:32:07.320]  and open up a new one.
[2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:13.680]  The judge denied us the right to subpoena Facebook to try to retrieve that deleted information.
[2:32:13.680 --> 2:32:20.280]  Obviously, this would be the basis of a very strong appeal unless the president, as an
[2:32:20.280 --> 2:32:27.400]  act of both justice and mercy, will end this horrific nightmare for me and my family and
[2:32:27.400 --> 2:32:30.280]  either commute my sentence or pardon me.
[2:32:30.280 --> 2:32:32.520]  I don't know how much more I can take.
[2:32:32.520 --> 2:32:35.040]  They have destroyed me financially.
[2:32:35.040 --> 2:32:39.000]  They have put enormous pressure on my family.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:45.440]  I can't really make a living having trouble keeping groceries on the table.
[2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:51.280]  People who want to help me can go to StoneDefenseFund.com if they want to help finance my legal
[2:32:51.280 --> 2:33:01.760]  fight or they can go to StoneFamilySupportFund.com if they want to help support my family.
[2:33:01.760 --> 2:33:04.720]  I have not lost my spiritual faith in God.
[2:33:04.720 --> 2:33:09.680]  I have only strengthened it and I think at the end of the day, he will step in and ensure
[2:33:09.680 --> 2:33:11.840]  that the president does the right thing.
[2:33:11.840 --> 2:33:13.120]  I pray for that.
[2:33:13.120 --> 2:33:16.040]  It hasn't been promised to me or assured to me.
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:20.880]  But at this point, I think my future is in the hands of God and I believe at the end
[2:33:20.880 --> 2:33:23.360]  of the day justice will be done.
[2:33:23.360 --> 2:33:42.640]  We'll be right back.
[2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:46.600]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:53.000]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism and Obama, Hillary and the
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:57.960]  deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President Trump's election and they
[2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:01.400]  have been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:05.960]  Now they have been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression while
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:09.120]  China has already been open for business for more than a month.
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:14.680]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy and
[2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:18.400]  hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the new world order that have orchestrated
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:21.120]  this and not President Trump.
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:22.840]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:25.320]  They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:30.840]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based
[2:34:30.840 --> 2:34:33.840]  on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:40.400]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hope and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:44.040]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:49.200]  Since I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet
[2:34:49.200 --> 2:34:50.200]  of 2020.
[2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:55.960]  We will not have this sale that's going on right now in May until our Christmas sale
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:57.360]  comes up.

[2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:32.120]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:36.680]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.

[2:35:43.880 --> 2:35:49.040]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:50.640]  to where it is.
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:56.400]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[2:35:56.400 --> 2:36:01.120]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:05.320]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:09.680]  megabanks, but now I'm going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations.
[2:36:09.680 --> 2:36:16.520]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:22.920]  backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[2:36:22.920 --> 2:36:27.800]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:32.520]  moral high ground and say shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[2:36:32.520 --> 2:36:37.760]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more, so the cowards
[2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:41.240]  who went along with this with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your lives and
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:42.240]  our lives.
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:43.240]  Congratulations.
[2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:49.520]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot
[2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:54.520]  an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run
[2:36:54.520 --> 2:36:58.600]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[2:36:58.600 --> 2:37:03.240]  They got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:08.480]  of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[2:37:08.480 --> 2:37:12.240]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[2:37:12.240 --> 2:37:16.520]  Well that's what's going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic
[2:37:16.520 --> 2:37:22.520]  numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's
[2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:26.680]  going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:29.560]  Well for the third world it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead according to
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:34.360]  the UN and I believe their numbers because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:36.200]  to depopulate the third world.
[2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:39.360]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're
[2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:46.840]  a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:38:04.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:11.640]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:23.560]  the Info War.
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:25.060]  Welcome back to National Fire.
[2:38:25.060 --> 2:38:28.600]  We're in our last few minutes here with Roger Stone and by the way I just wanted to say
[2:38:28.600 --> 2:38:33.760]  that we at National Fire are big fans of Roger Stone as well as The Truth and I personally
[2:38:33.760 --> 2:38:38.280]  a big fan of his book, Stone's Rules, would highly recommend it and it is still available
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:39.680]  on his website.
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:45.240]  So I know Patrick you want to get into a little bit of just more of the misconduct that really
[2:38:45.240 --> 2:38:46.240]  happened here.
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:47.400]  It's an absolute travesty of justice.
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:50.520]  I don't know how these jurors sleep at night, Patrick.
[2:38:50.520 --> 2:38:56.440]  Well we've heard about the Russian setup agent who was actually an informant from Mueller's
[2:38:56.440 --> 2:39:00.800]  FBI according to an affidavit that we published from inside the Durham investigation by the
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:01.800]  way.
[2:39:01.800 --> 2:39:07.680]  We've heard about the politically biased jury foreperson, Tamika Hart, who was against
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:09.880]  Roger Stone against President Trump.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:14.640]  We've heard about Judge Amy Berman Jackson but now the left is actually claiming that
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:19.200]  Attorney General William Barr somehow intervened improperly in your case, Roger.
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:20.920]  How do you respond to that?
[2:39:20.920 --> 2:39:23.360]  Yeah, that's completely incorrect.
[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:27.640]  Those people obviously have not read the transcript of the sentencing hearing.
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:33.600]  First of all, let's talk about who prosecuted me because they submitted a sentencing memo
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:40.160]  which specifically accused me of involvement in foreign interference in our election.
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:44.520]  We know that I was never charged with that nor was I convicted of that.
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:49.560]  Then they included a group of other offenses that I was never charged with.
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:55.400]  For example, Stone violated the gag order when he published his book on the Mueller investigation
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:57.400]  that was critical of the investigation.
[2:39:57.400 --> 2:40:04.160]  My book came out on February 9th and the gag order was put in place February 12th.
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:06.680]  Should I get an extra six months for that?
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:12.920]  Or Alex Jones announced the mourning of the verdict that he had spoken to Stone and therefore
[2:40:12.920 --> 2:40:17.120]  Stone violated the gag order and he should get an additional six months.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.680]  Well, actually that is a total miscommunication.
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:22.080]  That never happened.
[2:40:22.080 --> 2:40:30.640]  So the fraudulent sentencing memo put forward by the prosecutors called for a stunning seven
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:37.520]  to nine-year sentence which is entirely out of whack to the actual crimes for which I
[2:40:37.520 --> 2:40:39.720]  was convicted.
[2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:47.280]  Now, the misnomer is that Attorney General Barr stepped in, withdrew that memo and replaced
[2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:48.280]  it.
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:49.280]  That's not true.
[2:40:49.280 --> 2:40:55.360]  The four prosecutors who quit in protest actually quit because they got caught lying to the
[2:40:55.360 --> 2:41:02.040]  U.S. attorney who was never expecting a seven to nine-month recommendation based on a whole
[2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:04.600]  series of falsehoods.
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:10.360]  But just the same, the new prosecutors specifically said at my sentencing hearing that they were
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:13.800]  not withdrawing the original recommendation.
[2:41:13.800 --> 2:41:20.560]  They added an additional recommendation saying the seven to nine was still valid if the judge
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:26.120]  chose to go there, but that they thought three to four years was more in line.
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:27.360]  Let's be very clear.
[2:41:27.360 --> 2:41:29.800]  The judge was not bound by any of this.
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:34.160]  These are guidelines which she had the full authority to ignore.
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:41.800]  So there was no effort by the Attorney General to fix my case.
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:45.480]  The corruption was in those four prosecutors.
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:51.880]  Now the mainstream media keeps calling them non-political, career-line prosecutors quit
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:53.880]  the stone case in protest.
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:55.560]  Really, let's go through them.
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:02.360]  Jonathan Cravis, Associate Counsel to Barack Obama in the White House, not a lying career
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:08.600]  prosecutor, certainly not political, look at his prosecution of the three aides to Congressman
[2:42:08.600 --> 2:42:15.360]  Ron Paul for campaign election violations, wow, he raided one of their homes at six o'clock
[2:42:15.360 --> 2:42:16.360]  in the morning.
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:17.360]  How about that?
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:23.360]  Again, a whole series of abuses there in that case, for which he should be disbarred, and
[2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:28.520]  he lied to the court in his surreply regarding the Russians hacking the DNC.
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:35.880]  And then there's Aaron Zelinsky, this pompous, arrogant windbag, bully, who bullied virtually
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:41.000]  every witness in front of the grand jury and who threatened witnesses.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:46.160]  This guy was Deputy Counsel to Hillary Clinton at the State Department.
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:52.120]  He had a direct interest in my case because his emails inside the State Department were
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:56.200]  among those documents that Julian Assange released.
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:02.960]  They were quite embarrassing to him, again, not a non-political career prosecutor.
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:06.640]  So this dog won't hunt.
[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:13.040]  Attorney General Barr is absolutely correct in recommending that the Flynn case be dismissed
[2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:20.720]  based on the egregious misconduct of the FBI and the DOJ in withholding exculpatory evidence
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:26.560]  that proved that General Flynn was set up, that proved that he committed no crime.
[2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:29.640]  There is no intercession in my case.
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:36.760]  The original, over-the-top, I think inappropriate sentencing memo that sought to hold me responsible
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:42.040]  for foreign interference in the election, which I was not convicted of or even charged
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:47.000]  with, was allowed to remain in place by Attorney General Barr.
[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:53.480]  So if Jonathan Cravis, who wrote a long piece for the Washington Post op-ed, were really
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:59.680]  concerned about the rule of law, then the outrageous conduct in the Flynn case would
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:04.840]  lead him to the reasonable conclusion that General Flynn's case should be over, that
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:11.600]  this American hero was set up and tortured financially and politically and legally for
[2:44:11.600 --> 2:44:12.920]  no reason.
[2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:15.520]  But he doesn't really believe in the rule of law.
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:20.720]  And to say that Attorney General Barr has politicized the Justice Department, that's
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:21.720]  laughable.
[2:44:21.720 --> 2:44:27.720]  That's precisely what Loretta Lynch did in the fixing of the Hillary Clinton email case,
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:30.880]  what could be more blatant or more egregious.
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:35.120]  So this idea that I got off easy is absurd.
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:41.040]  There are many constitutional issues on which my appeal could be based.
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:47.840]  But in all honesty, at 67 years old, being sent to a federal prison that is a hotbed
[2:44:47.840 --> 2:44:54.880]  of the coronavirus, I have a legitimate fear for my safety inside.
[2:44:54.880 --> 2:45:02.520]  And I don't expect the judge to grant, say, a stay of the execution of my sentence pending
[2:45:02.520 --> 2:45:03.520]  appeal.
[2:45:03.520 --> 2:45:10.520]  I don't expect an appeal bond, which is highly uncommon anyway, which is why I've been very,
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:16.960]  very clear about the fact that I am praying, as is every member of my family, for some
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:19.360]  executive relief from the president.
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:22.560]  As I said in the last segment, I've been promised nothing.
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:24.240]  I've been assured nothing.
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:27.520]  I have made no formal application for a pardon.
[2:45:27.520 --> 2:45:31.680]  My lawyers have not talked to the White House lawyers about a pardon.
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:38.200]  But based solely on the president's tweets, he understands that my conviction is an act
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:40.200]  that is a miscarriage of justice.
[2:45:40.200 --> 2:45:43.040]  He understands the jury was rigged.
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:48.800]  He understands juror misconduct when he sees it, even though Judge Jackson didn't.
[2:45:48.800 --> 2:45:55.440]  And when Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson and the president himself criticized the judge's
[2:45:55.440 --> 2:45:58.440]  actions, she went out of her mind at sentencing.
[2:45:58.440 --> 2:46:00.160]  Let's be very, very clear.
[2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:05.880]  The First Amendment of the United States Constitution allows any citizen whatsoever, other than me
[2:46:05.880 --> 2:46:10.880]  at the time, because I was under a gag order, to criticize the decisions of a federal court
[2:46:10.880 --> 2:46:13.200]  or the actions of a federal judge.
[2:46:13.200 --> 2:46:15.920]  That's not interference in the judicial system.
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.400]  It's an American right, but not if you're Judge Jackson.
[2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:22.560]  So this is my situation.
[2:46:22.560 --> 2:46:32.320]  I'm looking at, at this point, surrendering to the Bureau of Prisons May 30th at the earliest,
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:39.360]  subject to possible revision based on the coronavirus situation at that time.
[2:46:39.360 --> 2:46:45.320]  My appeal is filed, but that appeal is not likely to keep me out of prison.
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:54.480]  I have appeal to Americans and 65,000 of them have come through by going to stonedefensefund.com,
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:57.880]  stonedefensefund.com to finance my appeal.
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:47:03.720]  If you want to sign a petition to the president, you can go to freerogerstone.com.
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:06.360]  More than a half million Americans have signed there.
[2:47:06.360 --> 2:47:11.200]  There's another petition site where another quarter of a million Americans have signed.
[2:47:11.200 --> 2:47:19.640]  Or you can go to the stonefamiliesupportfund.com to help us keep groceries on the table, to
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:21.680]  keep gasoline in our tank.
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.320]  We're not living lavishly, folks.
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:25.800]  My wife has serious medical issues.
[2:47:25.800 --> 2:47:27.680]  We've lost most of our insurance.
[2:47:27.680 --> 2:47:29.680]  We are struggling to get by.
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:35.240]  They seek to crush you and make you plead guilty, but I have refused to do that because it is
[2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:39.240]  essential to reelect the greatest president of my lifetime.
[2:47:39.240 --> 2:47:46.240]  What bothers me more about all of this, gentlemen, is that I might be incarcerated during a presidential
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:52.160]  election, that I will not be free to do everything within my power legally to help reelect the
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:55.760]  greatest president of my lifetime, Donald Trump.
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:58.600]  That bothers me more than anything else.
[2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:01.400]  So I hope folks will rally to my side.
[2:48:01.400 --> 2:48:04.800]  I want to thank you guys at the national file.
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:07.560]  First of all, for your coverage, which has been outstanding.
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:10.560]  You've been the only guys willing to dig and get at the truth.
[2:48:10.560 --> 2:48:15.440]  And secondarily, for this opportunity to tell the American people what really happened in
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:19.880]  my case and make it clear, this can happen to you.
[2:48:19.880 --> 2:48:33.960]  Thank you, gentlemen, and God bless you.
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:40.920]  This is the end, my friends, my only friends, the end of our elaborate plans, the end of
[2:48:40.920 --> 2:48:46.720]  everything that stands the end, the safety, the delusion.
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:53.080]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen, because it was only the mirage of safety, movies and
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:58.520]  partying and living like children, never growing up, never caring about other people.
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:01.400]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:05.120]  Just like the history book show, it's just like the Bible states.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.360]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:15.120]  into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:18.120]  by spies and then they were enslaved.
[2:49:18.120 --> 2:49:23.800]  We are repeating that again today, compliance and going along with this system leads to
[2:49:23.800 --> 2:49:26.280]  absolute bondage.
[2:49:26.280 --> 2:49:28.360]  Info wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[2:49:28.360 --> 2:49:33.900]  Info wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[2:49:33.900 --> 2:49:37.040]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:43.560]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:49.920]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and the Linda Gates Foundation
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:51.920]  in full control.
[2:49:51.920 --> 2:49:57.600]  Many will submit through fear, others will be bought off, but in the end, the globalists
[2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:03.200]  admit they're building a post-human world and now that we're inside the cage, it's
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.120]  going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[2:50:08.120 --> 2:50:13.720]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[2:50:13.720 --> 2:50:20.200]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:21.200]  this.
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:25.920]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being born inside out.
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:31.320]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:36.440]  disgusting power trip.
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:51:05.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:05.160 --> 2:51:13.880]  First of all, last week, as many of you know, I had a power outage in my house 10 minutes
[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:23.000]  before ready to go on the air to do a knockdown drag out show on Vaxx2, the film, the real
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:27.960]  film about real vaccine destruction and damage.
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:35.320]  So bang, lights went out, power went off, the whole thing was dead.
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:44.160]  I was not able to contact the producer of the show, just sitting here in the dark cursing.
[2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:50.320]  Friend with a cell phone, much calmer than I was, set it up with the producer and I did
[2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:54.440]  the show via Skype on a cell.
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:52:04.720]  We got in five of the six clips from Vaxx2 and that video, that segment that I did has
[2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:08.360]  gone out all over the world.
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:11.720]  So actually it was a good thing.
[2:52:11.720 --> 2:52:13.800]  It was a good thing.
[2:52:13.800 --> 2:52:21.720]  And the stories of these parents and children, the horrific truth is now known by more and
[2:52:21.720 --> 2:52:33.640]  more and more people that cannot refute it, that cannot peddle their fake science, which
[2:52:33.640 --> 2:52:36.160]  is really murder.
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:37.160]  We have the science.
[2:52:37.160 --> 2:52:39.800]  Yeah, you have the science of murder.
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:44.760]  It's been the case since the beginning of all vaccines.
[2:52:44.760 --> 2:52:46.520]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:47.520]  It always was.
[2:52:47.520 --> 2:52:55.320]  It always will be, some people don't like me to say that, whatever, sorry.
[2:52:55.320 --> 2:52:59.480]  I'm 82 years old, I'm going to say whatever I want to say.
[2:52:59.480 --> 2:53:00.680]  The whole thing is a fraud.
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:02.320]  It was always a fraud.
[2:53:02.320 --> 2:53:05.120]  The natural immune system works okay.
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:09.360]  If it's not working okay, vaccines are not going to fix it, they're just going to make
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:12.400]  it worse.
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:17.240]  And when they say that vaccines have eliminated all kinds of illness, they're lying through
[2:53:17.240 --> 2:53:19.560]  their teeth.
[2:53:19.560 --> 2:53:27.400]  Because the only thing that vaccines can eliminate is the visible symptoms of a disease.
[2:53:27.400 --> 2:53:32.480]  So they can say, well, we don't see nearly as much measles as we used to because we don't
[2:53:32.480 --> 2:53:34.360]  see the rashes and so on.
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:42.200]  Yeah, that's right, because the immune system is no longer able, under the assault of vaccines,
[2:53:42.200 --> 2:53:50.920]  to mount an all out acute inflammatory response in the face of measles.
[2:53:50.920 --> 2:53:55.440]  And that response is what causes the rashes.
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:54:01.720]  So when the immune system is weakened by the vaccine, you don't see the symptoms anymore.
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:09.120]  And then these fake doctors and fake researchers can say, we prevented a million cases of measles.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:11.720]  They haven't prevented anything.
[2:54:11.720 --> 2:54:18.440]  They've just detoured the destruction around into other avenues.
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:25.160]  And some of those new symptoms they will call by other disease names and treat them with
[2:54:25.160 --> 2:54:29.720]  drugs and develop new destructive vaccines and so on and so forth.
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:32.880]  That's the way the game has always been played.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:40.480]  So when I get emails, and I get very few from pretend scientists, people in other words
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:45.080]  who think they're real scientists, and they, oh, how can you say this and you don't know
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:49.520]  what you're talking about and so on and so forth, they never offer any actual debate
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:53.040]  or facts or evidence, etc., etc.
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:54.800]  Never do that.
[2:54:54.800 --> 2:54:59.120]  They are the machine people that are trying to take over the planet and make all of us
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:04.760]  into bio machines because that's what they think we are.
[2:55:04.760 --> 2:55:07.160]  That's what's going on.
[2:55:07.160 --> 2:55:13.000]  It's the current brand of fascism that we're dealing with.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:19.560]  All under the guise of very reasonable science and the interpretations of the Constitution.
[2:55:19.560 --> 2:55:26.960]  And yes, the latest research shows this and that and so on and we're here to protect you
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:30.920]  and, you know, all of that.
[2:55:30.920 --> 2:55:31.920]  It's fascism.
[2:55:31.920 --> 2:55:34.280]  It's global dictatorship.
[2:55:34.280 --> 2:55:45.080]  And we're going to explore that here in this hour and we will be back after the break.
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:47.720]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:48.720]  in stock, like krill oil.
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:49.720]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:52.400]  We don't have the benefits of krill oil.
[2:55:52.400 --> 2:55:53.400]  It's incredible.
[2:55:53.400 --> 2:55:57.120]  Everything in your body, for your heart, your skin, your libido, your stamina, your dreams,
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:55:58.560]  that's where you go to sleep.
[2:55:58.560 --> 2:55:59.560]  It's well known.
[2:55:59.560 --> 2:56:00.800]  Experience it for yourself.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:05.640]  Infowarstore.com, X2 sold out for much, deep earth, pure crystal iodine, back in stock
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:10.680]  50% off, vasobites, back in stock 50% off, vitamin, and refusion, back in stock 50% off,
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:14.040]  real red pill, red pill, plus with all the vitamins and minerals and the preglonone.
[2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:15.040]  That's close to selling out.
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:18.240]  Both formulas were really close to selling out, real red pill, plus it's got some stimulant
[2:56:18.240 --> 2:56:19.640]  and an actual caffeine.
[2:56:19.640 --> 2:56:21.680]  That's close to selling out 50% off still.
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:25.840]  Infowarstore.com, and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying,
[2:56:25.840 --> 2:56:27.640]  we may not take orders in a few months.
[2:56:27.640 --> 2:56:32.080]  I may not ever be able to get products again, things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[2:56:32.080 --> 2:56:33.680]  This is total depression.
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:35.360]  The infrastructure is going down.
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:57:02.680]  Get the products while you still can.
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:12.320]  All right, so let's go into Moderna, the company that's now the leader in the clubhouse for
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:15.760]  making the COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:57:15.760 --> 2:57:25.840]  I know this has been talked about earlier today, but it bears some close announcements
[2:57:25.840 --> 2:57:28.880]  from me as opposed to Moderna.
[2:57:28.880 --> 2:57:31.000]  Oh yeah, they produced antibodies.
[2:57:31.000 --> 2:57:34.920]  Ooh, that's all great up on our hind legs to cheer.
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:44.600]  There, RNA vaccine, which is highly dangerous, causes autoimmune reactions, meaning the body
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:51.520]  attacks itself, as if this is what everybody wants, right?
[2:57:51.520 --> 2:57:54.280]  Yeah, okay.
[2:57:54.280 --> 2:58:00.000]  So this is a curious case of this company here, all right?
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:01.880]  Now they've existed for 10 years.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:06.600]  They're a biotech company out of Cambridge, Massachusetts, all right?
[2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:11.320]  So screwing your brains real tight and listen to this.
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:20.320]  They've never made a product that they brought to the public or to market, as they say, never.
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:27.680]  10 years, they've never done it, okay?
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:32.240]  Never made a product, okay?
[2:58:32.240 --> 2:58:41.920]  Now the technology that they're using to supposedly produce this COVID-19 vaccine is called RNA
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:44.120]  technology.
[2:58:44.120 --> 2:58:52.200]  That technology has never brought a product to market, not a drug, not a vaccine.
[2:58:52.200 --> 2:58:53.200]  Never.
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:59:00.480]  Unlicensed for use, complete, unlicensed for use, okay?
[2:59:00.480 --> 2:59:04.360]  All right, following me so far?
[2:59:04.360 --> 2:59:17.440]  So last year, Moderna lost $514 million, you can look it up, Forbes has the article, $514
[2:59:17.440 --> 2:59:23.160]  million they lost this year, last year, and they made, I mean, they took in $60 million.
[2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:34.080]  And most of that was, you know, government handouts and so on, right, okay?
[2:59:34.080 --> 2:59:42.040]  Now they are partnering with the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases
[2:59:42.040 --> 2:59:51.000]  headed by our good friend, Anthony Fauci, they're partnering to produce this vaccine.
[2:59:51.000 --> 2:59:54.320]  See any red flags yet?
[2:59:54.320 --> 3:00:08.200]  But back in April, they got federal handout of $500 million to produce a COVID-19 vaccine,
[3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:10.560]  this company, Moderna.
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:20.680]  Never brought a product to market in 10 years, lost $514 million last year, using an RNA
[3:00:20.680 --> 3:00:30.000]  technology, destructive technology, untested, never been licensed for use on the public
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:38.720]  for a drug or a vaccine, they made a pathetic $60 million last year, mostly in government
[3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:45.160]  handouts and money from other pharmaceutical companies, and they're partnering with Anthony
[3:00:45.160 --> 3:00:54.200]  Fauci, and this we're supposed to have faith in, this is what's being pawned off on us.
[3:00:54.200 --> 3:00:57.840]  Oh, Moderna, terrific company and so forth.
[3:00:57.840 --> 3:01:00.280]  How the hell did they get in here?
[3:01:00.280 --> 3:01:09.040]  Well, those of you watching here see how Fauci, Fauci decided, okay, I'm going to work with
[3:01:09.040 --> 3:01:10.040]  this company.
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:17.160]  I'm going to see what we can do with this company, why?
[3:01:17.160 --> 3:01:25.800]  Because Fauci and Gates and the World Health Organization and the CDC are itching, get
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:33.960]  this now, to introduce RNA technology into the marketplace for the public.
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:41.000]  This is what they are just drooling to do, why?
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:54.040]  Aside from its destructive capacity, because you can make vaccines much quicker that way.
[3:01:54.040 --> 3:01:57.640]  Manufacturing process is not nearly as long.
[3:01:57.640 --> 3:02:00.680]  You can turn them out, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:02.640]  And of course, this is what they want to do.
[3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:07.920]  They want to have a vaccine for every imaginable virus under the sun, but they shoot up everybody
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:15.720]  on the planet with and turn them into zombies, complete zombies, those that are left.
[3:02:15.720 --> 3:02:23.280]  And the RNA technology just happens to work well in the vaccine factory where they make
[3:02:23.280 --> 3:02:31.360]  the vaccines, much easier to do, and that's why they are partnering up here with Moderna.
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:37.560]  Because Moderna is this little outfit that's gotten all these investors on board.
[3:02:37.560 --> 3:02:44.640]  One ex employee of Moderna said something like, hard to tell the difference between,
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:52.560]  is this a drug company or an investment, are they raising money?
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:03:00.480]  But you see, with a company like Moderna, somebody like Fauci, he can shepherd this company.
[3:03:00.480 --> 3:03:07.360]  He can say, look, if I give the green light here to you boys, you're in clover.
[3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:09.680]  Understand that, don't you?
[3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:12.160]  And we want to bring RNA technology to the market.
[3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:13.160]  So you stick with me.
[3:03:13.160 --> 3:03:14.640]  I stick with you.
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:18.080]  We'll get this rolling here.
[3:03:18.080 --> 3:03:20.920]  You're the leader in the clubhouse.
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:29.520]  And they've got one of these hard charging, tough guy CEOs who's always, if you're not
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:34.160]  on board with what our mission is, then we get rid of you, and blah, blah, blah.
[3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:43.760]  And yes, I'm tough and intense because I'm doing this to save the world, yeah, you know.
[3:03:43.760 --> 3:03:44.760]  Right.
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:45.760]  Right.
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:51.480]  Otherwise, why in the world would you be even looking at a company like Moderna?
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:52.480]  They've got nothing.
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:54.040]  They've got no track record at all.
[3:03:54.040 --> 3:03:58.040]  They've got a minus track record.
[3:03:58.040 --> 3:03:59.920]  Because you can use them.
[3:03:59.920 --> 3:04:08.800]  And if Fauci gets his wish, which is to ram and jam this destructive RNA technology for
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:18.160]  vaccines into people's arms all over the planet, then Fauci's status as the hero in the eyes
[3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:30.040]  of the dumbed-down masses in public is elevated even to a much, much higher degree.
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:32.080]  How do you guys do this?
[3:04:32.080 --> 3:04:36.640]  I've always marveled that the Infowars crew in the studio.
[3:04:36.640 --> 3:04:41.160]  I can say mules, and within two seconds, they've got a mule on the screen.
[3:04:41.160 --> 3:04:46.040]  So there was Fauci receiving an award.
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:53.480]  His reputation will skyrocket even beyond what it is now for the dumbed-down public.
[3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:57.360]  Yeah, there's another picture of Fauci.
[3:04:57.360 --> 3:05:03.360]  So that's personal gain for him.
[3:05:03.360 --> 3:05:04.480]  Tremendous personal gain.
[3:05:04.480 --> 3:05:05.480]  Who knows?
[3:05:05.480 --> 3:05:11.200]  I mean, he's already been acting as interim president of the United States, taking charge
[3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:16.840]  of destroying the economy in the United States through the devastating, completely insane
[3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:19.520]  and unnecessary lockdowns.
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:23.080]  So maybe he has political ambitions.
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:27.200]  Maybe he wants to be Joe Biden's vice president.
[3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:28.200]  Think about that.
[3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:29.200]  Who knows?
[3:05:29.200 --> 3:05:31.200]  Who knows?
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:33.560]  Could be.
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:39.040]  Now Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made a claim, apparently.
[3:05:39.040 --> 3:05:45.400]  I see the quote delivered there on Gateway Pundit, an interview they did with him where
[3:05:45.400 --> 3:05:50.080]  he says that Fauci and Bill Gates, but in this case, we're talking about Fauci, stands
[3:05:50.080 --> 3:05:57.960]  to gain a tremendous amount of money from a coronavirus vaccine because he has patents
[3:05:57.960 --> 3:05:59.640]  in that area.
[3:05:59.640 --> 3:06:04.400]  I'm still tracking that down to see if I can find any hard evidence of that.
[3:06:04.400 --> 3:06:07.680]  I've looked at a list of Fauci's patents.
[3:06:07.680 --> 3:06:11.640]  I don't see one for vaccines in the list that I saw.
[3:06:11.640 --> 3:06:17.720]  I see other kinds of therapeutics, which, for all I know, might be able to be turned
[3:06:17.720 --> 3:06:19.360]  into vaccines.
[3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:20.880]  Not sure about that.
[3:06:20.880 --> 3:06:28.600]  But regardless, a no name company is suddenly bolted into the spotlight here to deliver
[3:06:28.600 --> 3:06:32.960]  a crushing vaccine to the global population.
[3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:39.600]  Yeah, there's the link to Kennedy.
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:40.960]  Talk to you after this break.
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:44.000]  Hollenblok has really been a sleeper product for us.
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:45.600]  We got it in a few years ago.
[3:06:45.600 --> 3:06:50.080]  It's an amazing product that comes from all natural quail eggs.
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:54.320]  They discovered this more than 30 years ago in France that if you ate quail eggs from
[3:06:54.320 --> 3:06:59.960]  a certain type of quail, that it had an anti-histamine effect and people saw their allergies and
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:02.440]  seasonal discomfort knocked way, way down.
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:05.320]  Well, now this is available in the United States.
[3:07:05.320 --> 3:07:06.320]  It's proprietary.
[3:07:06.320 --> 3:07:07.920]  It has rave reviews.
[3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:12.440]  It's a product that I never even really promote, but that people keep reordering and has become
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:13.440]  a best seller.
[3:07:13.440 --> 3:07:16.640]  We're very close to selling out Hollenblok right now.
[3:07:16.640 --> 3:07:18.440]  It'll take eight weeks to get more in.
[3:07:18.440 --> 3:07:22.600]  But despite that, I'm going to sell it at 50% off until it sells out.
[3:07:22.600 --> 3:07:26.560]  So for those of you that have never ordered it and been on the fence and have seasonal
[3:07:26.560 --> 3:07:32.400]  discomfort, experience Hollenblok for yourself right now at m4warstore.com for free.
[3:07:32.400 --> 3:07:34.640]  50% off Hollenblok.
[3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:38.520]  I want people that haven't tried it to try it for themselves, so it's the lowest price
[3:07:38.520 --> 3:07:40.720]  ever even though it's selling out.
[3:07:40.720 --> 3:07:44.920]  One of our best selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four
[3:07:44.920 --> 3:07:48.240]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:50.920]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast.
[3:07:50.920 --> 3:07:54.440]  And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[3:07:54.440 --> 3:07:55.840]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[3:07:55.840 --> 3:07:56.840]  I look.
[3:07:56.840 --> 3:07:58.640]  In January, 2016, I went in a hospital.
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:00.880]  I went in the VA hospital out here in Boystein.
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:04.760]  I was in there until June, and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal
[3:08:04.760 --> 3:08:10.040]  was listening to Info Wars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys
[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:11.520]  talking about Living Defense.
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:12.520]  Let me tell you something, man.
[3:08:12.520 --> 3:08:17.040]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I was something with it for about five or six
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:19.640]  years, and the doctors, they tried every time.
[3:08:19.640 --> 3:08:20.840]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:24.360]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[3:08:24.360 --> 3:08:25.360]  you know what?
[3:08:25.360 --> 3:08:27.000]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:30.080]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff,
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:31.080]  and I ordered it.
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:32.080]  It shipped to me.
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:33.080]  I got it.
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  I hid it from the nurses.
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:35.080]  I started taking it, man.
[3:08:35.080 --> 3:08:36.080]  That stuff changed my life.
[3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  It saved my life.
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:44.280]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[3:08:44.280 --> 3:08:50.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:08:50.280 --> 3:09:08.720]  Let's talk a little bit about Jay Inslee, the governor of the state of Washington, who
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:16.920]  has issued this fascist proclamation to one and all in his state that if a person refused
[3:09:16.920 --> 3:09:26.840]  to get tested or rebels against contact tracing, then they're isolated in their homes and they
[3:09:26.840 --> 3:09:31.640]  can't go out even to pick up groceries.
[3:09:31.640 --> 3:09:35.560]  So at a press conference, he was asked, well, how do you plan to enforce this?
[3:09:35.560 --> 3:09:42.520]  And he said, well, if the person doesn't have any friends who will go out to shop for him,
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:44.880]  then we'll have support people.
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:49.080]  Man, they're hiring, baby, in Washington.
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:54.040]  We got support people, yeah, that'll come to your house and do their grocery shopping
[3:09:54.040 --> 3:09:56.240]  for you, really.
[3:09:56.240 --> 3:09:59.520]  I mean, where do they get these fascists?
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:02.560]  Well, let me tell you where.
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:10.160]  Not many people understand this, but Jay Inslee, the governor of the state of Washington, used
[3:10:10.160 --> 3:10:16.600]  to work for Bill Clinton when Bill was the prez.
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:26.680]  And Jay was a regional director of the Department of Health and Human Services.
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:30.080]  I would assume that's the Northwest region of the United States.
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:37.960]  Now, the Department of Health and Human Services is a cabinet post that oversees the CDC, the
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:43.320]  National Institutes of Health, Fauci's agency, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:50.040]  So you see, Jay Inslee is already a public health official.
[3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:53.040]  That's what he is.
[3:10:53.040 --> 3:10:56.320]  He isn't just the governor of the state of Washington.
[3:10:56.320 --> 3:11:02.800]  He isn't just taking dictation from a public health official about the lockdowns, which
[3:11:02.800 --> 3:11:06.800]  is happening in most states of the country.
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:12.920]  No, he is a public health official.
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:22.240]  So he's there already with the boots and the hat and the orders and the commands.
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:23.240]  Yeah.
[3:11:23.240 --> 3:11:28.320]  Jay sees it clearly indeed.
[3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:34.040]  Control over the population.
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:37.600]  You're letting the strings a little bit looser.
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:44.480]  You've noticed in the lockdowns and so on and so forth.
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:47.400]  Just don't go back.
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:48.400]  Don't go back.
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:51.320]  Come out and don't go back.
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:54.960]  That would be my motto.
[3:11:54.960 --> 3:12:00.360]  Come out and don't go back.
[3:12:00.360 --> 3:12:01.960]  Never again.
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:03.720]  Never go back.
[3:12:03.720 --> 3:12:08.160]  Not happening.
[3:12:08.160 --> 3:12:11.840]  What is a patriot in the face of all of this?
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:15.840]  What's the Constitution say?
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:17.080]  What are the founding principles?
[3:12:17.080 --> 3:12:24.000]  I mean, if people don't know them by now, they're hopelessly lost as they see their freedom
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:34.360]  being screwed away, tightened, tightened, tightened, tightened under this fake guise of a fake pandemic,
[3:12:34.360 --> 3:12:40.360]  which I never tire saying, been saying it since the beginning, been investigating fake
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:49.280]  epidemics for about 30 years now, and I keep telling people, fake, fake, fake and fake.
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:59.040]  The whole thing is a fake on many, many different levels, and they're just simply using that
[3:12:59.040 --> 3:13:05.840]  with the parade of ignoramuses to destroy freedom, which is their goal, because they
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:15.800]  think that we are biomachines and they want to make us into more of a biomachine through
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:21.360]  their therapies, through their therapies.
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:23.200]  They can put whatever they want in the vaccine.
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:28.280]  I mean, come on, anything.
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:32.800]  And they say, well, you see, we have the RNA and synthetic RNA.
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:33.800]  Really?
[3:13:33.800 --> 3:13:34.800]  What does that mean?
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:35.800]  Synthetic RNA?
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:41.880]  You mean you just manufacture it from what?
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:42.880]  Snake oil?
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:48.600]  Okay, synthetic RNA, and we put it in the cells, and that turns the cells, you see, into their
[3:13:48.600 --> 3:13:54.680]  own little drug factories, and they make their own remedies, and so, oh yeah, this sounds
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:14:02.240]  absolutely fabulous, like in a science fiction story that was rejected from a pulp magazine
[3:14:02.240 --> 3:14:07.680]  as being too ridiculous, that kind of thing.
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:15.400]  But this is what they're floating, and aside from, as I say, the admitted risk, because
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:20.200]  companies have tried to bring this technology to market and failed.
[3:14:20.200 --> 3:14:24.840]  That's the other thing when you talk about Moderna.
[3:14:24.840 --> 3:14:29.360]  Not only are they trying to bring a technology to market that's never been licensed and never
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:33.880]  been used in any product before, but other companies have tried and failed.
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:38.840]  Why have they failed? because of serious adverse effects, as they say.
[3:14:38.840 --> 3:14:45.720]  Heavy problems, such as autoimmune cascades, as they like to say.
[3:14:45.720 --> 3:14:46.720]  What does that mean?
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:54.600]  It means the body begins to recognize itself as the enemy and self-destructs.
[3:14:54.600 --> 3:15:03.400]  Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good model of what they would really like to do.
[3:15:03.400 --> 3:15:04.400]  Right?
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:09.520]  The depopulation should be the highest priority foreign policy towards the third world, Henry
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:18.600]  Kissinger, except now everybody is the third world.
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:19.800]  I mean, it's pretty simple.
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:24.920]  So you've got to come out of the house, got to go back to work.
[3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:28.840]  Businesses have to reopen.
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:35.960]  They have to go back to making a living.
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:37.280]  I mean, what's the alternative?
[3:15:37.280 --> 3:15:41.320]  Well, we're not supposed to do that.
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:43.760]  What are we supposed to do?
[3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:46.840]  No, Mr. Bond, you're never in Goldfinger.
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:50.800]  You're supposed to die.
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:56.400]  That seems to be the project, don't you think?
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:57.400]  Wouldn't you say?
[3:15:57.400 --> 3:15:59.640]  Don't you know?
[3:15:59.640 --> 3:16:08.800]  Oh, but you see, it's not okay for us to go outside and just flop around and enjoy the
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:12.800]  sun and talk to other people and relax.
[3:16:12.800 --> 3:16:14.960]  No, no, no, no, no, we can't do that.
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:17.240]  We're not permitted to do that, you see.
[3:16:17.240 --> 3:16:19.920]  No, there's Goldfinger.
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:20.920]  No.
[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:26.640]  No, we're not supposed to do that.
[3:16:26.640 --> 3:16:31.320]  We're not supposed to have that freedom.
[3:16:31.320 --> 3:16:34.120]  Too dangerous, they say.
[3:16:34.120 --> 3:16:36.680]  So what if they say it?
[3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:42.000]  Got to go outside, got to come out, got to go back to work, got to have business, got
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.600]  to have the economy.
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:53.840]  Protests are great, but got to go back to work, got to earn a living, got to have an economy.
[3:16:53.840 --> 3:17:01.000]  Now I understand all about the currency reset and the destruction of the currency and how
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:05.120]  we're all being made slaves to the government because the government is saying, well, you
[3:17:05.120 --> 3:17:12.240]  know, we give you a check, even though you have no job, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3:17:12.240 --> 3:17:18.320]  Yeah, there's that level of the whole thing, but there's a basic level.
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:24.160]  Basic level is got to go back to work, got to open up businesses that can reopen, got
[3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:32.120]  to have commerce, got to have an economy, got to do it, exactly, guys standing there
[3:17:32.120 --> 3:17:37.880]  with a mask on and a sign that says, this is ridiculous, well, that's ridiculous.
[3:17:37.880 --> 3:17:40.320]  We'll be back.
[3:17:40.320 --> 3:17:42.920]  The United States is not communist China.
[3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:45.880]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:47.760]  We don't blow up churches.
[3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:50.960]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:57.200]  But all over the news, we see the UN, billable indicates, WHO, mainstream corporate media
[3:17:57.200 --> 3:18:00.280]  praising communist China for their response.
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:04.520]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has
[3:18:04.520 --> 3:18:07.720]  robots controlling people, well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[3:18:07.720 --> 3:18:12.480]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio pass laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese
[3:18:12.480 --> 3:18:13.480]  virus.
[3:18:13.480 --> 3:18:16.840]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[3:18:16.840 --> 3:18:22.040]  These people are out of control, control freaks, and they are going to lose big time because
[3:18:22.040 --> 3:18:26.000]  we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them in their
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:27.120]  power grab.
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:31.440]  The resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[3:18:31.440 --> 3:18:35.480]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats, and then we'll be able to defeat
[3:18:35.480 --> 3:18:39.000]  their operation that much quicker.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:43.720]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was
[3:18:43.720 --> 3:18:46.080]  the most common form of government.
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:50.920]  We've got a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it, and the
[3:18:50.920 --> 3:18:56.080]  rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level for control.
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:19:01.040]  In fact, in most cultures, they call the peasants the little people because they were usually
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:07.520]  a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving
[3:19:07.520 --> 3:19:08.520]  level.
[3:19:08.520 --> 3:19:12.720]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[3:19:12.720 --> 3:19:13.720]  elite.
[3:19:13.720 --> 3:19:18.480]  All the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezos is the
[3:19:18.480 --> 3:19:19.480]  world.
[3:19:19.480 --> 3:19:23.960]  They're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:29.720]  living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving
[3:19:29.720 --> 3:19:30.720]  to death.
[3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:36.320]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[3:19:36.320 --> 3:19:39.400]  We must break free from these monsters.
[3:19:39.400 --> 3:19:44.440]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[3:19:44.440 --> 3:19:48.160]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[3:19:48.160 --> 3:19:52.080]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:53.080]  world.
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:58.520]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:19:59.520]  to be.
[3:19:59.520 --> 3:20:04.680]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[3:20:04.680 --> 3:20:05.680]  economy.
[3:20:05.680 --> 3:20:09.680]  So we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[3:20:09.680 --> 3:20:14.960]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:16.840]  They've admitted all of this.
[3:20:16.840 --> 3:20:22.440]  So remember, how does M-Full Wars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able
[3:20:22.440 --> 3:20:24.880]  to predict things before they happen?
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:29.720]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes, it's dystopic
[3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:31.160]  and yes, it's scary.
[3:20:31.160 --> 3:20:35.320]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[3:20:35.320 --> 3:20:42.160]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:21:09.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:19.480]  Remember the end of On the Waterfront, Marlon Brando?
[3:21:19.480 --> 3:21:24.960]  He leads the guys on the dock, on the waterfront, back to work.
[3:21:24.960 --> 3:21:31.360]  Let's go back to work, finally, because the workers decide they're going to follow him
[3:21:31.360 --> 3:21:35.720]  rather than the mob boss, played by Lee Cobb.
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:39.280]  That's kind of the way it is.
[3:21:39.280 --> 3:21:41.720]  The mob bosses are saying, you've got to stay inside.
[3:21:41.720 --> 3:21:42.720]  There he is.
[3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:43.720]  Let's go back to work.
[3:21:43.720 --> 3:21:45.220]  Man, you guys are fantastic.
[3:21:45.220 --> 3:21:47.400]  Here's Terry Malloy, right?
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:54.600]  Leading the men back in at the end of On the Waterfront.
[3:21:54.600 --> 3:22:00.160]  Yeah, Carl Maldon, even Marie St.
[3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:07.120]  So the mob bosses are saying, no, no, no, you've got to do what we tell you to do.
[3:22:07.120 --> 3:22:09.800]  You don't work until we tell you to work.
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:13.280]  You don't make any money until we tell you you can make money.
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:17.600]  You can't go outside until we tell you, no, no, no, no, no.
[3:22:17.600 --> 3:22:21.520]  You don't tell us.
[3:22:21.520 --> 3:22:23.640]  You don't tell us.
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:34.800]  I can't use some words here, but really like to itching to look at these pathetic creatures.
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:43.080]  The machine men, rule the world as a machine.
[3:22:43.080 --> 3:22:45.440]  If you survive, you fit into a slot.
[3:22:45.440 --> 3:22:51.680]  Wall-to-wall surveillance 24 hours a day, we're selling it to protect you, and China
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:55.040]  comes to the rest of the world.
[3:22:55.040 --> 3:22:56.800]  I wrote this right at the beginning.
[3:22:56.800 --> 3:23:00.440]  I said, China is now being praised as the model.
[3:23:00.440 --> 3:23:02.600]  Oh, China's fantastic.
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:03.880]  Look what they did.
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:09.040]  They locked down 50 million people overnight in three cities, and then they raised an ante
[3:23:09.040 --> 3:23:10.800]  up to 100 million.
[3:23:10.800 --> 3:23:11.800]  That's marvelous.
[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:15.560]  And this is what we have to do, too.
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:16.560]  Really.
[3:23:16.560 --> 3:23:18.080]  Is that right?
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:23.400]  Well, it turns out that's what they wanted all along, and that's what they did at the
[3:23:23.400 --> 3:23:30.520]  CDC and the World Health Organization, and all these little scumbag public health officials
[3:23:30.520 --> 3:23:37.600]  who live inside governor's offices and yammer day and night about the virus.
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:41.480]  The virus is going to kill everybody anyway, and, sir, and you'll be responsible for the
[3:23:41.480 --> 3:23:45.760]  deaths unless you lock down everybody and so on and so on and so on.
[3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:49.320]  Off with their heads.
[3:23:49.320 --> 3:23:52.960]  Get out of my office.
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:24:00.480]  It's the sheriffs, if you want to look to public officials, who need to assert control.
[3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:05.680]  So if there's any sheriffs that are listening now, you are the basic law enforcement authority
[3:24:05.680 --> 3:24:07.840]  in your county.
[3:24:07.840 --> 3:24:13.840]  You can decide what to do and what not to do.
[3:24:13.840 --> 3:24:20.840]  Just as the sheriff, and I think it was Maricopa in Arizona, said, I'm not going to lock down.
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:22.720]  I'm not going to do it.
[3:24:22.720 --> 3:24:26.800]  This is not the America I grew up in.
[3:24:26.800 --> 3:24:31.280]  We get people coming across the border still on vacations.
[3:24:31.280 --> 3:24:34.880]  You think we're going to lock down all our businesses and just go broke and die?
[3:24:34.880 --> 3:24:36.680]  I'm not going to do that.
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:39.000]  Well, what about the governor?
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:44.200]  Well, the governor does what the governor does, but I'm not going to lock down this county.
[3:24:44.200 --> 3:24:46.960]  Where are the sheriffs?
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:49.360]  How many?
[3:24:49.360 --> 3:24:58.240]  Sheriff in Maine, Sheriff Mack, where are all the other sheriffs?
[3:24:58.240 --> 3:25:00.960]  Too many of them are just faceless bureaucrats.
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:06.240]  They're not in touch with the people who actually elect them.
[3:25:06.240 --> 3:25:08.720]  They have nothing to do with that.
[3:25:08.720 --> 3:25:15.600]  They're just career bureaucrats and politicians who are machine people.
[3:25:15.600 --> 3:25:17.560]  They are part of the machine.
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:18.840]  We are taking you over.
[3:25:18.840 --> 3:25:20.960]  We are part of the machine.
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:24.320]  There is a Michigan sheriff who won't enforce.
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:29.240]  Okay, not going to do it.
[3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:31.840]  Right.
[3:25:31.840 --> 3:25:33.400]  California sheriff.
[3:25:33.400 --> 3:25:35.600]  All right.
[3:25:35.600 --> 3:25:44.320]  So let's have, I don't know, two or 3,000 more sheriffs right away who do this.
[3:25:44.320 --> 3:25:47.840]  Not going to lock down.
[3:25:47.840 --> 3:25:48.840]  That's on one level.
[3:25:48.840 --> 3:25:56.080]  On the other level, out of the house, back to work, open the businesses, got to do it,
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:07.760]  got to earn a living, not taking the vaccine, don't try to push it down our throats.
[3:26:07.760 --> 3:26:09.080]  Let's see.
[3:26:09.080 --> 3:26:12.320]  You take it on television first.
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:17.800]  We'll have our people go in there independent to make sure you're not just injecting yourself
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:27.840]  with water and shoot all of you machine lunatics up and then we'll see, you know, does it do
[3:26:27.840 --> 3:26:28.840]  you any good?
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:30.320]  Does it do you fall over?
[3:26:30.320 --> 3:26:34.080]  Do your eyeballs suddenly roll up in the back of your head?
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:36.640]  Did you develop sores all over your body?
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:41.400]  Do you walk out into the middle of traffic, not understanding where you are?
[3:26:41.400 --> 3:26:44.080]  We need to track you.
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:45.480]  We need to track you.
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:50.840]  We're not the ones that need to be tracked like the Chinese slaves.
[3:26:50.840 --> 3:26:52.560]  You're the ones who need to be tracked.
[3:26:52.560 --> 3:26:54.480]  What do you do every day?
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:55.480]  Where do you go?
[3:26:55.480 --> 3:26:57.040]  Who do you talk to?
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:26:59.480]  Who's paying you off?
[3:26:59.480 --> 3:27:06.760]  Because look, as far as Fauci is concerned, whatever the truth is about whether he's got
[3:27:06.760 --> 3:27:12.640]  patents on this or patents on that, whether he's officially going to make money on this,
[3:27:12.640 --> 3:27:17.960]  backdoor deals are the easiest thing in the world.
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:22.880]  If you want the money, you get the money.
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:23.880]  Simple as that.
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:32.160]  This whole thing, it's an illusion backed up ultimately by force, right?
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:34.760]  That's what fascism is.
[3:27:34.760 --> 3:27:36.200]  That's what dictatorship is.
[3:27:36.200 --> 3:27:38.280]  That's what they're doing in China.
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:42.560]  They've already built all these smart cities in China and they're building more.
[3:27:42.560 --> 3:27:44.400]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[3:27:44.400 --> 3:27:48.840]  Because they're ushering the age of technocracy and they're telling their own people, hey,
[3:27:48.840 --> 3:27:50.360]  you got a cell phone.
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:53.840]  If there's a red stripe on it, you got to stay at home.
[3:27:53.840 --> 3:27:58.520]  In the smart city, everything is a computer and it's all going to be watching you on
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:04.480]  tracking you all the time and you are anybody who lives in the city, everybody who lives
[3:28:04.480 --> 3:28:09.160]  in the city all the time.
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:10.160]  It's coming.
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:11.160]  It's here.
[3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:12.800]  It's in America.
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:17.200]  The megacorporations in America are doing it as we speak.
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:22.680]  There was an audio podcast at Wall Street Journal, 11 minutes.
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:25.920]  They spelled it out.
[3:28:25.920 --> 3:28:29.280]  Megacorporations in America are reconfiguring their offices so that when the people come
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:34.480]  back, not only the social distancing, but the cell phones carry the cell phone.
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:36.040]  We track you all day long.
[3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:41.240]  At the end of the day, you get a score on your cell phone as to how you did.
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:43.360]  Well, how did you do today?
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:44.440]  Well, I got a six.
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:45.440]  What did you get?
[3:28:45.440 --> 3:28:46.440]  Well, I got a seven.
[3:28:46.440 --> 3:28:48.960]  Oh, well, I don't know.
[3:28:48.960 --> 3:28:50.040]  Why did you get a seven?
[3:28:50.040 --> 3:28:51.040]  I got a six.
[3:28:51.040 --> 3:28:52.560]  I have to go complain.
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:56.600]  I mean, really, how can they, and what did you, I got a four.
[3:28:56.600 --> 3:28:58.480]  Well, they're going to have to stay home.
[3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:00.520]  There's something wrong with you.
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:06.040]  Get on that mask and don't get near me because your grandma might have a disease.
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:07.040]  You live with her at home.
[3:29:07.040 --> 3:29:09.120]  You told the company about that, didn't you?
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:11.120]  Yes, they asked me.
[3:29:11.120 --> 3:29:12.120]  And this is happening.
[3:29:12.120 --> 3:29:14.240]  I'm not making this crap up.
[3:29:14.240 --> 3:29:15.240]  Who do you live with?
[3:29:15.240 --> 3:29:18.280]  They're going to, they ask their employees.
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:23.760]  Any old people, any people that are sick that have a history of illness and disease and
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:24.760]  so on.
[3:29:24.760 --> 3:29:25.760]  Well, okay.
[3:29:25.760 --> 3:29:31.400]  You're going to be in the caste system of the new employees, you're going to be at
[3:29:31.400 --> 3:29:37.920]  the bottom, which means hopefully the job you do can be done at home because we don't
[3:29:37.920 --> 3:29:42.320]  want you in the office, right?
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:47.360]  And then the other cast, two and three, well, they're healthier and they don't have the
[3:29:47.360 --> 3:29:49.000]  red stripes on their cell phone.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:51.680]  No, they're going to get a green stripe or whatever it is.
[3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:56.480]  Oh, you got a nine today, credit score at work.
[3:29:56.480 --> 3:29:59.000]  I think that's just wonderful.
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:05.720]  Let's take Bob out for supper because he got a nine at the office today.
[3:30:05.720 --> 3:30:07.680]  These are the robots we're dealing with, folks.
[3:30:07.680 --> 3:30:10.120]  I'm talking to you, Patriots out there.
[3:30:10.120 --> 3:30:15.600]  These are the numbskull idiots that we're dealing with out there in the world.
[3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:17.120]  Oh, we have to follow the orders.
[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:18.360]  Oh, we have to get vaccinated.
[3:30:18.360 --> 3:30:19.760]  Oh, we need antibodies.
[3:30:19.760 --> 3:30:22.160]  Oh, we've got to be afraid of the virus.
[3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:27.080]  Oh, it's the contagion, the transmission, the contact tracing, the testing.
[3:30:27.080 --> 3:30:42.880]  It's all pathetic, oh, I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020, and within a week or so,
[3:30:42.880 --> 3:30:46.960]  many of the best selling items that we're selling in FullerStore.com will no longer
[3:30:46.960 --> 3:30:47.960]  be at 50% off.
[3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:51.880]  In fact, last year, I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't
[3:30:51.880 --> 3:30:55.760]  enough for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[3:30:55.760 --> 3:30:58.640]  But I want you to get the ultimate krill oil.
[3:30:58.640 --> 3:31:00.640]  I want you to get vasovetes.
[3:31:00.640 --> 3:31:02.840]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.

[3:31:38.040 --> 3:31:39.040]  Now it's official.
[3:31:39.040 --> 3:31:45.040]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years,
[3:31:45.040 --> 3:31:50.240]  and the UK government said, you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[3:31:50.240 --> 3:31:54.360]  because we have to track your social distancing, and you're only allowed to have a list of
[3:31:54.360 --> 3:32:00.960]  10 people that you visit, and if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[3:32:00.960 --> 3:32:05.400]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals
[3:32:05.400 --> 3:32:11.840]  out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential
[3:32:11.840 --> 3:32:13.080]  and a prisoner.
[3:32:13.080 --> 3:32:16.640]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian
[3:32:16.640 --> 3:32:18.160]  anti-human group.
[3:32:18.160 --> 3:32:23.440]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their end game,
[3:32:23.440 --> 3:32:25.680]  which is global depopulation.
[3:32:25.680 --> 3:32:29.200]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[3:32:29.200 --> 3:32:35.160]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's
[3:32:35.160 --> 3:32:36.640]  mortal enemy.
[3:32:36.640 --> 3:32:40.280]  Wake up or die.
[3:32:40.280 --> 3:32:47.280]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:49.880]  about what is really in the air around us.
[3:32:49.880 --> 3:32:54.320]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[3:32:59.720 --> 3:33:02.760]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:45.440]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I've told folks going back three months
[3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:49.160]  ago, I'm not buying storeable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[3:33:49.160 --> 3:33:53.200]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse, and now it's admitted
[3:33:53.200 --> 3:33:57.200]  that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of
[3:33:57.200 --> 3:34:01.000]  farms and ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in the third world.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:04.800]  Now I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it, but with the election
[3:34:04.800 --> 3:34:09.360]  fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else
[3:34:09.360 --> 3:34:14.680]  is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods because they'll last for 25 years.
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:16.680]  They're in easily totable bags.
[3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:20.480]  It's high-quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready, and it funds
[3:34:20.480 --> 3:34:21.480]  the InfoWars.

[3:34:30.600 --> 3:34:31.600]  on them.
[3:34:31.600 --> 3:34:32.600]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.

[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:07.520]  I'm going to talk to him, talked about him on the show.
[3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:14.720]  He's the scientific fraud who made the prediction that 500,000 people were going to die in the
[3:35:14.720 --> 3:35:24.800]  UK and 2 million in the US with one of his abysmal, ridiculous, fake, absurd computer
[3:35:24.800 --> 3:35:29.440]  models.
[3:35:29.440 --> 3:35:35.560]  And supposedly, Fauci used this to turn the screws on Trump, and Trump said, well, 2
[3:35:35.560 --> 3:35:36.560]  million are going to die.
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:37.800]  Yeah, I mean, I got to do something.
[3:35:37.800 --> 3:35:40.160]  Yeah, well, Trump keeps saying this.
[3:35:40.160 --> 3:35:44.040]  Yeah, well, 2 million, they told me, so we had to do something, and we did, and it was
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:45.040]  great.
[3:35:45.040 --> 3:35:46.040]  Yeah, okay, fine.
[3:35:46.040 --> 3:35:48.560]  Except the computer model was fake.
[3:35:48.560 --> 3:35:50.180]  Everybody should have known it was fake.
[3:35:50.180 --> 3:35:52.280]  Nobody asked about it.
[3:35:52.280 --> 3:35:59.920]  Boris Johnson in the UK started out saying, we got to just let people live and develop
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:02.200]  natural immunity and so forth.
[3:36:02.200 --> 3:36:06.960]  It'll be okay, and then all of a sudden, when Ferguson's model came out from the Imperial
[3:36:06.960 --> 3:36:15.200]  College in London, oh, no, we can't do that, well, so Ferguson's total fraud.
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:21.440]  I laid this out chapter and verse, for example, in 2005, which people would not like to remember
[3:36:21.440 --> 3:36:30.600]  when it came to bird flu, he predicted, what was it, 200 million people could die.
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:36.040]  Now the final result, according to official figures, was several hundred.
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:39.360]  Not 200 million, but several hundred.
[3:36:39.360 --> 3:36:42.240]  Boy, you would think, okay, Neil, you're fired.
[3:36:42.240 --> 3:36:48.240]  I mean, you know, pack up your bags, get lost, pump gas, whatever you want, but no, no, no,
[3:36:48.240 --> 3:36:49.240]  no.
[3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:51.400]  Not only did he keep his job, but he's praised his job.
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:57.280]  The genius by his associates and colleagues are in the same fake business that he's in,
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:02.720]  which is making computer predictions and models, which everybody admits, even those in the
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:07.280]  business, that we're just basically guessing here.
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:10.200]  We don't have a crystal ball, don't blame us.
[3:37:10.200 --> 3:37:16.120]  They say the government acts however they act based on what we feed them, but we're
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:17.480]  not the ones.
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:19.000]  We take no responsibility.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:23.640]  It's like, you know, the petty bureaucrats would say, okay, so 5,000 more people have
[3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:24.640]  to die?
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:27.720]  Is that, yeah, I guess so, all right, well, I didn't do this.
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:30.560]  I'm just signing the order and passing it along.
[3:37:30.560 --> 3:37:35.280]  Yeah, sure, we understand.
[3:37:35.280 --> 3:37:45.960]  So Ferguson, his model was used to lock down UK, France, Germany, US, and then other countries
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:48.600]  followed suit.
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:51.960]  So, you know, he's an arch fraud.
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:58.920]  I mean, how can you possibly, you want, I want to say live with yourself, but obviously
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:01.520]  he's doing just fine.
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:09.240]  So all of a sudden, as you might recall, a week or two ago came out, well, guess what?
[3:38:09.240 --> 3:38:14.880]  His married girlfriend, she's married to somebody else, comes from her big house to visit him
[3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:18.080]  during the lockdown, not supposed to do that.
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:21.840]  They have their ongoing affair, blah, blah, blah.
[3:38:21.840 --> 3:38:27.160]  And oh, may a culpa, he says, yeah, I messed up, I didn't follow the right rules I should
[3:38:27.160 --> 3:38:31.640]  have and so forth, and oh, and he resigns from his position.
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:36.360]  And for a day or two, it's a big scandal in the newspapers in London and England.
[3:38:36.360 --> 3:38:43.240]  And then he's gone, everybody forgets about it, conveniently forgets about him.
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:46.840]  It's called pleading to a lesser charge.
[3:38:46.840 --> 3:38:51.760]  I'm not guilty of destroying all of these lives through lockdowns that are completely
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:39:00.640]  unnecessary and total crap based on my crap predictions using a crap model that was used
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:07.760]  to convince idiots to lock down nations, no, that's not the crime.
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:13.800]  The crime is had sex with my girlfriend, I'm resigning, I'm sorry, you won't hear from
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:22.960]  me again, bye-bye, and of course, most people, Neil Ferguson, who's he?
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:27.080]  Pleading to a lesser charge.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:32.840]  Just another thread of the fraud that we're exposing here.
[3:39:32.840 --> 3:39:37.160]  The lockdowns were based on a prediction.
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:44.840]  The prediction was insane made by somebody with an abysmal track record, I've laid this
[3:39:44.840 --> 3:39:55.160]  out chapter and verse, over the years of making stupid, idiotic, unreliable, meaningless
[3:39:55.160 --> 3:40:03.160]  predictions, Neil Ferguson, okay?
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:09.120]  You would think that when he made the prediction about, oh, 500,000 people are going to die
[3:40:09.120 --> 3:40:15.960]  in the UK and 2 million in the US unless we lock down everybody, you know, somebody would
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:20.760]  have said, well, how'd you come to that decision, Neil?
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:25.200]  Come on into my office and sit down and explain it to me in language that I can understand.
[3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:29.640]  Well, I don't know, it was where I can do that, well, you're going to have to, Neil,
[3:40:29.640 --> 3:40:36.120]  if you want to keep your job, because we in the government take this kind of thing fairly
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:41.120]  seriously as to whether we're going to lock down the entire nation or live free.
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:43.160]  You understand, Schmuck?
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:49.440]  This is what we're dealing with, Schmuck had lunatic, Neil, that's why I brought you
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:52.600]  into my office, so I want to talk to you about this.
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:57.160]  So tell me, how did you come to your number here, prediction as well?
[3:40:57.160 --> 3:41:00.360]  That's very complicated when we do this and the formula.
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:07.200]  This is the same kind of model used in 2005, right, to predict 200 million people could
[3:41:07.200 --> 3:41:10.920]  die from bird flu and official stats are only a few hundred.
[3:41:10.920 --> 3:41:13.920]  Use the same basic model, predict, right?
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:19.640]  Well, yeah, it's all over, I see, Neil.
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:23.640]  So in other words, you're a fraud, right, you're a fake, right?
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:27.120]  I mean, come on, just the two of us have a drink, you know, let's smoke a cigar.
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:31.800]  And we'll just laugh the whole thing off because, you know, you're just full of it, it's coming
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:36.160]  at your ears, oozing out of every pore, and I'm not liking down the country because,
[3:41:36.160 --> 3:41:38.160]  you know, why should I believe you?
[3:41:38.160 --> 3:41:42.120]  Because you're just an idiot, a total friggin idiot.
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:47.320]  And everybody ought to know it, and I think make sure it gets in the papers that I decided
[3:41:47.320 --> 3:41:49.280]  that you were a complete idiot, a fraud.
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:54.720]  But you'll keep your job at Imperial College, that's funded, your institute there, by the
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:42:00.280]  way, by Bill Gates, tens of millions of dollars a year, Billy likes you because you make these
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:06.680]  diet predictions that make it easier for him to sell his idea of destroying lives all around
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:08.600]  the world through vaccines.
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:12.400]  Because every time you predict a virus is dangerous, then he can say, we need a vaccine,
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:14.720]  we need a vaccine, we must have a vaccine.
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:18.400]  So we get the picture, Neil, we know what you're doing, right?
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:23.160]  I mean, come on, drink up, Neil, it's not going to be that bad for you.
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:28.160]  I mean, we're not going to put you in prison, exactly, although locking you down might be
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:29.160]  a nice idea.
[3:42:29.160 --> 3:42:35.080]  Why don't we do actually, you know, now that I think, Tony Fauci, come on in, Tony, yeah,
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:38.400]  you schmuck, sit down, listen to what I'm going to do here.
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:43.880]  Because you're the one, Tony, as I recall, that relayed what Ferguson said to me as a
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:47.440]  president to try to convince me to lock down America.
[3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:51.880]  So Neil and I have been talking here, he's a complete fraud, you know that, Tony, right?
[3:42:51.880 --> 3:42:52.880]  Yeah, come on.
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:42:55.360]  We're all men, we know what's happening, right?
[3:42:55.360 --> 3:43:02.000]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to lock down Neil, yeah, we're going to let America
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:07.440]  stay free, because that's what this country is based on in case you remember, Tony, remember?
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:13.160]  Yeah, freedom as a whole idea, that's why we had a revolution, remember that, no, no?
[3:43:13.160 --> 3:43:18.760]  Okay, well, you know, do some reading and spare time while you're in isolation and running
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:20.760]  away and so forth, you know.
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:28.400]  Go ahead, Tony, folks, meanwhile, Neil, we're going to lock you down, completely lock you
[3:43:28.400 --> 3:43:32.560]  down, you know, we're going to put you in a little apartment, a rat-fested apartment,
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:38.320]  no job, no work, you'll exist on, you know, maybe we'll give you a little money to buy
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:45.680]  food, but you can't go out, no, you can't go out, got to self-isolate, like Jay Inslee
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:51.520]  says, you've got to maybe have a friend who can come over from England and go shopping
[3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:58.600]  for you at groceries, whatever, if not, we'll send over somebody from the military, you
[3:43:58.600 --> 3:44:03.400]  know, to make sure you get your groceries, whatever, but we're going to lock you down,
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:08.400]  Neil, and we're going to put a camera on you all day, all night, and we're going to broadcast
[3:44:08.400 --> 3:44:13.040]  live on a TV channel so the rest of the world can see what a fraud really looks like and
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:17.040]  everything you do, you're sitting there, you're scratching your behind, you're doing whatever
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:21.360]  you do, you take a shower, you sit there, you stare out the window, you play with numbers,
[3:44:21.360 --> 3:44:27.640]  we'll give you a laptop, you know, you can amuse yourself, whatever, you can make up
[3:44:27.640 --> 3:44:32.240]  models till the cows come home, right, but you're not going to force us to lock down
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:36.920]  the country, that's something you're not going to do, Neil, so, and don't give me any crap
[3:44:36.920 --> 3:44:42.040]  about, you know, how you're not locking down anybody, you're just supplying numbers to
[3:44:42.040 --> 3:44:46.840]  the government, we know that that's a total sham, you know, come on, Neil, have another
[3:44:46.840 --> 3:44:54.920]  drink, yeah, before we lock you down, bring the boys in with the weapons to make sure
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:45:00.160]  that Neil doesn't get away, and we want to call Boris, get Boris on the line from London
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:05.640]  because let's tell him that we're locking down one of the, well, we've got to say it,
[3:45:05.640 --> 3:45:12.040]  he's an arch criminal, one of the arch criminals in England, in the UK, really, I mean, right,
[3:45:12.040 --> 3:45:18.400]  I mean, we're doing Boris a favor, keep the open society, Boris, keep it open, we'll
[3:45:18.400 --> 3:45:24.160]  keep it open, we'll lock down this shmuck, and keep them locked down, and that'll be
[3:45:24.160 --> 3:45:38.000]  it, but it isn't it, so we have to unlock ourselves.
