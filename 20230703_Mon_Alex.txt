[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Intro
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's News. Today.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:43.360]  It is Monday, July 3rd, 2023. I'm your host, Alex Jones. The next phase of the globalist
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:51.040]  technology civilization, the Islamic uprising, has begun. Right on time, as we predicted
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:58.960]  it would this summer. The EU is now using this to arrest prominent leaders, soccer team
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.440]  head coaches, you name it, that just mildly criticize the Islamic targeting of Christians
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.880]  and white people. They're being arrested. You will be destroyed. You will be annihilated.
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.560]  We will burn down Notre Dame. We will stab you to death and you will love it. And the
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.840]  entire Islamic world will dump its garbage on us, its criminals, its military age men,
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.640]  and we will love it because we're sadomasochistic weaklings. At least that's what they think
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.840]  we are. Are we that? Well, on this eve of July 4th, our nation's birth date, I declare
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.520]  my independence from all this tyranny. Boy, Trump, we called it back at the time as well,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.760]  had reporters actually in France covering it. The national media say, Jones is insane.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.720]  Paul Watson is in Paris and in Brussels and in other areas claiming there's no go zones.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.160]  You're white, you walk through these areas, you can go, we can go up 10 miles and every
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160]  square inch somebody threatened to kill you or attack and you're trying to run cars over
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.560]  you. Well, now nobody denies the no-go zones. So here, ladies and gentlemen, is Trump from
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.440]  the time capsule as candidate Trump, 2016. I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.000]  France because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.920]  me for saying that France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.360]  they better get very tough and very smart. Now let's move to a few of the other little
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.040]  clips we have here and we'll break more of this down when we come back after the break.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.120]  This is all part of a larger plan. We'll be laying that out in great detail. Let's now
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.960]  go to clip. Now we'll do clip 20 next segment. It's too important. Very well known Imam of
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.840]  Peace calls out Western countries for importing garbage that the Muslim countries wanted
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.000]  to imprison or isolate, which is dead on. We're going to be covering that coming up
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.600]  next segment. We're also going to get to the rest of the story. This is obviously massive,
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:18.120]  shocking race rioters chant Allah Akbar as they torch France 719 arrested. Macron wants
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.000]  platforms to delete riot content, blame social media, video games for the riot spread, not
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.600]  the globalist government, the clergy plan bringing in tens of millions of military Muslims.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.120]  It begins. France has shut down the Internet. It's already happened. I mean, widespread
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.080]  rioting France detains. That's a soccer coach for making racist and Islamophobic remarks.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.760]  He just said this is an Islamic takeover. Netflix, of course, last year had a whole
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.240]  show about the Islamic uprising and how beautiful it would be and how wonderful it would be
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.720]  all based on innocent teens killing. Yeah, just a few weeks ago, supposedly Red Square
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.000]  that was going to be in fire. Now it's at least six nations in Europe. And here's Macron
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.680]  on national television saying he's implementing the Internet kill switch. We've got all this
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.200]  and more coming up. And look at this. Thousands of illegal alien invaders, not migrants, were
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.400]  camping out in the forest of northern France, waiting to jump boats and illegally cross
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.320]  the channel. Used to be a couple thousand a month. Now it's a few thousand a day. They're
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.200]  actually kicking military veteran pensioners out of their section eight housing in the
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.120]  UK and putting the illegal aliens in it. You cannot make this up. Looks like the Texas
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.960]  border, doesn't it? All you in NGO run the guy that runs the Texas invasion for 10 years
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.960]  ran the EU invasion. Oh, and we got video coming up next segment of the Border Patrol.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.200]  When the Texas guard put up bar bar, they came and cut it down to bring the illegals
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.080]  in because it's what they do. It's their job. Help smuggle the children in. It's just
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.240]  a fact. That's why they have border patrol checkpoints like 100 miles inside the U.S.
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.160]  They try to stop me. I just laugh at them. You don't control the border. You bring in
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:10.120]  the kids. This is the biggest sale of the year so far. July 4th. Super sales just started

[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:46.680]  A lot of people wonder why five years ago we bought an MRAP armored vehicle. Well, to
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.080]  go out and cover leftist demonstrations, you've got to have them. They try to kill you. Had
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:01.600]  five times. So, ladies and gentlemen, let me just say something here very calmly on this Monday,
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:14.720]  July 3rd, 2023 transmission. We have a huge plethora, cornucopia spectrum of news to cover,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.280]  but it all ties together. World government, carbon taxes, world IDs,
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.040]  Nigel Farage and other Brexit leaders being completely debanked, no banks to let them
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:34.960]  even have a bank account. This is AP Reuters. Biden wants to block out the sun, the Bill Gates plan
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.560]  to save the earth. Sounds like Dr. Evil. It's not a joke.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.840]  More video surfacing of Bill Gates calling for depopulation. We've got that.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.560]  Climate change lockdowns being announced. We are going into permanent martial law right now. If
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:01.280]  humanity does not wake up and if humanity does not wake up quickly. But all of this ties together.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.400]  What have I been saying now the last year is the next thing they're going to do. Race riots in
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:16.480]  Europe and the United States. Power outages they blame on hackers. Quote MAGA supporters.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.880]  Expanded wars and then a new virus. That's what I expect. That's some of their main playbooks.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.400]  That's some of the main cards out of their playbook. And there's some other angles of
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:35.120]  this as well. So I want to open the phones up. We had some guests scheduled, but we've cleared
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:43.760]  the slate because I want to give you a chance to respond to one question. I don't usually screen
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.280]  calls, but today we're doing one question. But there's kind of a trick to that. This one question
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.920]  is everything. What are the globalists going to pull next and in what order and how do we stop them?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.360]  That is a giant field of discussion. And then interspersed with your calls, I'm going to
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:11.040]  methodically go over every stack. This stack right here. I've just five stories, five videos.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.960]  We do the whole show on unbelievable. We must cover this. I'm getting chills right now.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.120]  Wow. Some of the stuff we found is just I'm getting I'm as high as a kite right now. Naturally,
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:31.120]  I'm just just just just just just a chill up a spine about how dangerous these people are.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.600]  Wow. A whole. That's one of the strongest chills I ever got.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.440]  Then I've got this stack of people, prominent doctors, scientists, athletes,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:49.280]  as young as 20 dying of myocarditis. We've got statistics on Amish, how they have almost no
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.520]  cancer, no autism. The list goes on and on. They don't take the shots and they don't drink the
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:10:03.360]  fluoride water and the whole cocktail that we're given. We've got. People winning lawsuits
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.240]  all over the United States and Europe for when they say there's only two sexes and two chromosomes,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.520]  X and Y for men and women, they're winning in court. Of course, they should win in court.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.880]  You're allowed to say the sky is blue and the sun is yellow and blue birds are blue. We've got that.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.480]  We've got the Democrats knives out for Biden, and they're already admitting it's Gavin Newsom
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.200]  is who they plan. I think it's Gavin Newsom for everything I've seen. I respect Roger Stone.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.600]  He's almost always right. He says it's Big Mike. He says it's Big Mike. You know, I think they're
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.760]  delusionally getting him ready, Big Mike. But I don't I don't think they're going to go with
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.480]  Big Mike. I think it's Newsom. But I may be wrong. We've got that stack. Why Democrats should
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.520]  primary Biden Politico and the headlines go on and on. Something's wrong with his brain. Let's
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:11:00.320]  get rid of him. Well, I said that during the 2020 campaign. In twenty nineteen, that he clearly
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.600]  had another stroke because he was already out of it, but suddenly it was a lot skinnier, couldn't
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.560]  talk, couldn't get it together. I said he's had another stroke and he's had a bunch of them.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.840]  And so at least three of them. And so that was one of the reasons I got banned again. They said,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:21.120]  well, he's a new level of band. You may call for violence against him. Alex Jones is a dangerous
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.120]  person. Remember that? And eleven other people, Louis Faircon, Paul Watson.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.840]  Just just just just crazy who was on the list, Gavin McGinnis. And so that really made a man.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.480]  But now, oh, my goodness, he doesn't know who he is. We need to get rid of him right now.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.800]  That's a big deal. And so much more here today.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.520]  But the subject of what's happening in France and Belgium and Switzerland and the U.K. and
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:59.040]  there were Molotov cocktail attacks yesterday and today against corporate businesses,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.000]  Safeways and Nike's, which means it's probably Antifa. They're like funded by those groups that
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.040]  they then they go, they go firebomb their bosses, literally BlackRock controls and owns all that.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:20.800]  So we're going to be walking through all of this in great detail today. We have the whole carbon
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:29.040]  tax. A new world order. Shut down angle as well, that's a big deal. And that ties into this,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.000]  this story. And if you're a new listener, just tuned in. You're going to think this isn't true,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.040]  it just sounds insane. Or maybe you read articles or see stories about infowars the last decade or
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.160]  so that Jones is insane. He says they're adding chemicals to jet fuel to block out the sun,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.040]  part of a secret program to stop global warming. No, there was a Nobel Prize in 92 over it.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.800]  They started the program in 93 and the atmosphere has a 20 plus percent dimming effect because of
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.520]  the nuclei sprayed out from the jet engines. The jet companies aren't involved. It's the
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.160]  main kerosene producers. That's jet fuel. We have the patents. We know how it's done.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.680]  They got a bunch of other aircraft that have even more intense ways of doing it.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:14.080]  It's all over the Department of Energy and other governments have similar programs. It's all part
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.120]  of a U.N. treaty. I have the CIA director admitting they're doing it. Seven years ago,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:26.080]  I played the club about 100 times. But now. Here it is, ladies and gentlemen, Biden
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.600]  admin supports blocking out the sun to stop climate change. Just just type into Google
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:39.200]  News. Just type in block out the sun. Biden, block out the sun, Reuters, AP everywhere.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:44.960]  It's Bill Gates's, quote, plan. And now they admit they're going to have planes in the jet fuel,
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:52.080]  spray barium, salt, saline dioxide out to save us. So but but but do it for viewers.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.440]  I want the crew to go to go to Big Daddy Google. It's all it's censored. But they'll just type in
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:05.760]  Biden, block out the sun or Biden, the sun. Just Biden, T.H.E., S.U.N. And you'll see
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.640]  thousands of articles about how reasonable it is and how we need to do it immediately.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.920]  Well, it's been going on and now they're going to go fully operational with it.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.920]  There's some of your headlines. More gloomy news. Biden backs plan to block the sun.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:33.680]  Daily Mail, all of them, CNBC. White House releases report on solar geoengineering.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.120]  Print that one for me. Science Times, Biden opens door to geoengineering atmosphere.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.840]  But man, I like Joe Rogan. He was all about chemtrails till about eight years ago. He did
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.080]  that TV show debunking him. And he will not say he's wrong, kind of like Trump once he's
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.080]  one, once he says something, he knows full well this is going on. That's why I got mad at Joe
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.640]  about six years ago and blew up at him on air and said, I'm not going to put up with this because
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.800]  I know Joe's as smart as I am and knows all this is true. So good for Joe. But the point is,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.200]  it's out in the open. But the media says it's not kosher to talk about this. It doesn't exist.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.360]  Then they officially roll it out and still say, don't talk about it, though.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.680]  We'll call you anti-Semitic. I don't want you spraying aluminum dioxide that kills the crops
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.760]  and bioaccumulates in our brains and is super toxic. And who made you God? And why are you
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.040]  blocking the sun out? Shut up, anti-Semite. You're like, what's that have to do with Jews? Well,
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.840]  the ADL says it has a lot to do with it. Now, drink your fluoride and shut the hell up and die,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:44.320]  boy. Man. But listen, I'm going to come back and I'm going to spend several segments on the
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.120]  engineered collapse in Europe, where that's going, how it's all planned. Guys,
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.560]  print me the clergy plan off Wikipedia. People won't believe it. It's a hundred year plus plan
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.600]  to Islamify Europe. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.760]  Speaking of support, we have the biggest sale of the year so far, the July 4th supercell going

[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.680]  We have three original one of a kind toothpaste designed by my father, a dentist
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.560]  at infowarsstore.com that don't have fillers that are filled with high quality essential oils
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.520]  and more. We have the turmeric toothpaste. We have the ultimate tooth whitening with

[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.480]  through mother nature. So it's now back in stock and became a bestseller. The turmeric toothpaste
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.400]  is available again at infowarsstore.com. We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.240]  We've got some of that left, and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.240]  in stock, but it's running out as well. So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:04.720]  infowarsstore.com. I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had. I don't think anybody
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.800]  can deny it. And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.720]  crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.920]  the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:28.400]  engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:32.480]  the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support. I want to encourage you now to
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:38.080]  realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you spread the word,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.160]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most viewers and listeners
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:47.120]  never go to infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.280]  all at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.880]  buy products at infowarsstore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarsstore.com,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:02.400]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now. Just weeks ago, I warned the world
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.920]  that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air. People
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.920]  said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened. They've got quadrillions of stolen
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.960]  money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.960]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air. It's the same thing
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:23.760]  with Infowars. Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.360]  like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners. When you support us,
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:36.480]  we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.800]  you, which is we the people. I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.920]  listeners to understand, please don't take Infowars for granted. We're barely hanging on.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.760]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.320]  at the same time at Infowarsstore.com. So don't procrastinate. Go to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.480]  get amazing products and keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:29.540]  Thank you for joining us on the eve of the birth date of our republic, I want to declare
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.860]  independence today against the globalists and all their operations and all their plans.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:40.699]  So earlier I talked about the fact that it's in the Associated Press, NBC News, everywhere.
[00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:45.699]  The White House is signing on to Bill Gates' plan to have jets have aluminum dioxide, barium
[00:20:45.699 --> 00:20:49.939]  salts and other things added to the jet fuel, which then aerosolizes and creates nuclei
[00:20:49.939 --> 00:20:56.139]  or clouds so they can, quote, block the sun and send the radiation back out into space.
[00:20:56.139 --> 00:21:00.220]  It's been going on since the early 90s and now they're just telling you they're going
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.139]  to do it because they've already been doing it.
[00:21:02.139 --> 00:21:08.740]  It's the same thing with the Kalergi plan, it's the same thing with replacement migration.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.919]  You can go to the U.N.'s own website and type in replacement migration and there are hundreds
[00:21:12.919 --> 00:21:18.460]  of documents there saying we're going to bring in 600 plus million people to America, to
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:25.220]  the U.S., we're going to bring in 100 million to France, 100 million to Germany.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.340]  It says each country gets between 150 million people.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.659]  Places like Belgium get 50 million.
[00:21:31.659 --> 00:21:35.699]  And they said we're going to keep them as a permanent underclass, not let them even
[00:21:35.699 --> 00:21:40.179]  have jobs, and then use them to burn down cities whenever we want.
[00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:41.500]  So just let's do it.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.659]  You can also put Infowars.com prefix on a search engine and you can pull up Infowars.com
[00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:51.820]  articles from a decade ago about replacement migration with links to the United Nations
[00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.020]  website.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:22:04.220]  So this is a fact and you see the United Nations organizing these groups and running the border
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:10.699]  operations in Europe and in the Americas and bringing in these populations.
[00:22:10.699 --> 00:22:16.020]  So there on screen is a 2001 program of the U.N. on replacement migration.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:20.300]  It is a solution to declining and aging populations.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.219]  From the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, okay?
[00:22:25.219 --> 00:22:26.580]  United Nations Secretariat.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.060]  I've got another one here I'm going to get to that's brand new.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.940]  By 2030 you will not eat meat and you will be allowed only three items of clothing new
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.940]  a year.
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:46.419]  It says the report adopted by the United Nations Future for Urban Consumption in the 1.5 Sea
[00:22:46.419 --> 00:22:50.500]  World Report sets out targets for cities where there's greenhouse gases.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:56.500]  The plan to start the press release stated in which those who consume the most in consumption-based
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:02.780]  emissions must be cut by 50% by 2030, they only said they're going to cut consumption-based
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.899]  emissions food, construction, clothing, vehicles, aviation and electronics to begin with.
[00:23:08.899 --> 00:23:11.060]  They're going to take them away from you.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.300]  We'll be getting to the reports and showing them to you here today so you can go look
[00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:20.379]  on the U.N. website and you can read all about their horrible plans for you and your family.
[00:23:20.379 --> 00:23:23.540]  But you're seeing the invasion.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.219]  They say come here.
[00:23:25.219 --> 00:23:30.740]  They set up big U.N. refugee centers on the border of Europe and they pay for the Zodiac
[00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:33.659]  boats to come in from North Africa.
[00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:37.540]  And tens of millions, it's over 20 million in the last 10 years conservatively, have
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.620]  porn in.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:44.659]  Tourism is down 80%, crime everywhere, half the cities are no-go zones if you're white
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.500]  and you go even near one of these zones, you are dead.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.500]  And it is just absolutely vitriolically anti-white, totally psychotic, totally out of control.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:01.340]  But remember, the same U.N. NGOs, that's non-governmental organizations, that run the invasion in Europe
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.500]  run the invasion on the Texas, Arizona, Mexico, California border on record.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.500]  Look up.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.500]  U.N. Soros NGO that ran Europe invasion runs Texas invasion.
[00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.659]  We went down there two years ago, showed the group, showed their trucks, showed them
[00:24:14.659 --> 00:24:18.940]  in command, showed the news articles that they are in command.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:25.540]  On average, I'd say they're 30-year-old Ph.D. leftists, social engineers down there, and
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.540]  they run the show.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.060]  They run the child smuggling.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.620]  They run the programs to make sure there's not DNA testing now of the children when they're
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.020]  just handed off to random people including newborn babies.
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.500]  I mean, it's as hardcore criminal as you can get.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.620]  People say, oh, let's send the National Guard.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.980]  The National Guard's down there cutting the barbed wire.
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.300]  The Border Patrol's down there cutting the barbed wire and then trying to keep reporters
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300]  away from seeing it.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.179]  Let's show some of that footage in Texas.
[00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:57.379]  That's the Border Patrol cutting fences that the state guard had put up and letting the
[00:24:57.379 --> 00:25:02.820]  people through.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.820]  So that's how this works.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.899]  Then they're under globalist control.
[00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:10.500]  They're organized.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.020]  They are a political weapon.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.460]  You notice these Latin American people coming in, but it's also Chinese, Russians, Muslim
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.460]  record levels.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.780]  The Latin Americans, a lot of them do have children with them, but a lot of the children
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.300]  are not theirs.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.300]  That's what's so crazy.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:33.340]  Remember, the lockdowns of the last few years is what directly precipitated all of this.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:39.740]  Now, I want to play you something that is incredibly powerful right now.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.620]  That is this imam who lays it all out and breaks down what's really happening.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.460]  And we'll come back and tell you more about the imam and specifics of this on the other
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.580]  side and give the number out.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.580]  Here it is.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:00.860]  Funny enough, the IRGC cannot operate in Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.340]  Their supporters cannot have bank accounts in the UAE.
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.980]  The other extremist groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, who are friends with the IRGC
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:15.300]  and Hezbollah people, they cannot operate in Bahrain, in Oman.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]  These are Muslim countries.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.300]  Where do they operate?
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:23.399]  In London, in France, in Washington DC, in Australia, in Canada, Toronto.
[00:26:23.399 --> 00:26:24.399]  They operate here.
[00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:25.399]  They have bank accounts.
[00:26:25.399 --> 00:26:26.899]  They register charity.
[00:26:26.899 --> 00:26:27.899]  Right.
[00:26:27.899 --> 00:26:37.899]  So, Macron, the president of France, recently said, the Islamic world is in a crisis.
[00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:41.780]  In my opinion, yeah, we do have problems.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.340]  We do have Boko Haram.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.340]  We have Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:45.340]  We have Taliban.
[00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.340]  We have problems.
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.860]  But the broader picture, Islam is very successful.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:52.020]  It's growing very fast.
[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.020]  And we're doing really well.
[00:26:53.139 --> 00:26:55.139]  Dubai is not in a crisis.
[00:26:55.139 --> 00:27:00.940]  Abu Dhabi, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, there's no crisis there.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:02.659]  The Muslim countries are doing good there.
[00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:05.020]  Only some places there's a problem.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.060]  I say, no, you are in a crisis.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:17.460]  You went to the Muslim countries and you imported the garbage that the Muslim countries wanted
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.919]  to put in prison or isolate away from society.
[00:27:22.919 --> 00:27:24.879]  You went and you imported them.
[00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:25.879]  Why?
[00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:27.379]  For cheap labor.
[00:27:27.379 --> 00:27:29.840]  But these Islamist extremists, they don't want to work.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.480]  They want free welfare.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.280]  They want to marry French women, blonde hair, blue eyes.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.480]  They don't have time to work.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.719]  So look at Poland.
[00:27:39.719 --> 00:27:44.719]  They don't complain from Islamic extremism, not a single terrorist attack in Poland.
[00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:47.840]  The moment they sense there's a problem, they crack down on it.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.840]  Polish policy, beautiful.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.080]  The French, no, come.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.120]  When they come, they use the resources.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.800]  They go to Washington DC and they sit in Congress.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.399]  They support the Iranian regime.
[00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:07.080]  They go against the sanctions in Congress, right?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.760]  With their hijab.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.159]  Why?
[00:28:10.159 --> 00:28:14.960]  Because the ideology is filth to begin with.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:21.860]  When you import that or you allow it in or you amplify it or you glorify it in any way,
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.139]  you make your bed, sleep in it.
[00:28:24.139 --> 00:28:27.500]  So that is also a problem of the West.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:34.540]  The question is, Tina, did the extremists become stronger or the West become weaker?
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:37.780]  I say it's both.
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.780]  And that fellow is very famous.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.780]  We got to go to break.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.900]  I'll tell you his name and information when we come back.
[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:42.900]  But he's dead on.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.900]  That's what this is.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.780]  But the left, they weren't getting a working group.
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.620]  You don't bring military age men in for that.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.620]  Put them on welfare.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.620]  They brought in a group.
[00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.620]  They control.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.620]  They can activate.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.340]  They're the ones using it to bring in martial law and arrest the nationalists for being
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.780]  racist and kick the Muslims out.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:03.500]  Speaking of support, we have the biggest sale of the year so far, the July 4th supercell
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.500]  going right now.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.980]  And nitrate boost is so good for your heart, your brain, your lungs, your cardiovascular.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.500]  Everybody needs to clean out your blood and then take on a routine basis.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.340]  Plus, it does great things for your muscles, your stamina, your libido.
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.340]  It's amazing.
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.340]  It is in stock right now.
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.340]  Super female vitality is selling out.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.340]  We got a good shipment of it in.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.340]  The super male sold out.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:20.340]  Despite that, it's 60% off.
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.340]  Then, of course, we have super high quality, high spectrum, full spectrum CBD oil.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.340]  It's great for your neurological systems, your whole body.
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.340]  It's available.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.340]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.340]  Discounted up to 60% off.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.340]  Double patreon points at infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.340]  And we are selling out of real red pill plus.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.340]  But if you want that, you can get that.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.340]  I mean, it's going to sell out in like a week.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:30.340]  Current sales rates.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.340]  Again, we need funds.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.340]  We need people.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:34.340]  We need people.
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.340]  We need people.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:36.340]  We need people.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340]  We need people.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:38.340]  We need people.
[00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.340]  We need people.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.340]  We need people.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.340]  We need people.
[00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.340]  We need people.
[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:58.340]  I want to get way out of the hole and expand.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.340]  But we can only do that with your support.
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340]  So please take action now.

[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.420]  A lot of people have asked me, why is Infowarsstore at Infowarslife?
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.940]  Not at a pro biotic for more than three years?
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.179]  The answer is simple.
[00:30:07.179 --> 00:30:10.100]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.300]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.940]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.940]  anymore.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.980]  Finally, we've got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.940]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:59.820]  Take action now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.179]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:09.379]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:09.379 --> 00:31:14.540]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:19.340]  supplement maker that are Lister's and Patriot's that are allowing us to private label it at
[00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.739]  a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:31:21.739 --> 00:31:25.860]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:31.980]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.179]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:38.820]  inductive to pain.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.080]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:48.219]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWars MD and Nerve Renew from InfoWars MD exclusively
[00:31:48.219 --> 00:31:51.300]  at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:56.460]  Introducing them both, 25% off, you'll find them exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com and
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.900]  they fund our operation.
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.739]  book that documents the globals in their own words plan for our future that is a hellish
[00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:09.739]  future.
[00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:13.139]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[00:32:13.139 --> 00:32:17.139]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[00:32:17.139 --> 00:32:21.300]  Amazon, or InfoWarsStore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.060]  the book after the signed copies we got run out and there's about a thousand left of them
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.060]  right now.
[00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:32.580]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.500]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.340]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.020]  you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.620]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:50.580]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsStore.com
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.420]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.699]  or give them to the local school.
[00:32:56.699 --> 00:32:59.340]  This is an InfoWar, I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:08.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:15.420]  My brother died at 00.30 at night.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.420]  For the memory of Didier, the culprits will be brought to justice.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.420]  I ask you to stay calm.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:30.420]  Netflix produced a show heavily pushed in France last year of a poor little Islamic.
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.420]  He should be killed so the Muslims burn the country down.
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.420]  Lead the country, the communists have them.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.420]  They love it, the globalists love it.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.420]  They want their French Revolution.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.420]  They're going to use the Muslims to detonate it.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.420]  And when they're done, they'll brush the Muslims aside.
[00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:00.420]  They're telling the Muslims they rule.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.420]  Man, I've been in Europe and had the Muslims smart mouth me,
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.420]  so everybody's bowing down to them.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.420]  They cannot believe it when you tell them go to hell.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.420]  If they want to get in a fight, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to crack someone with their head then.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.420]  I'm tired of bowing to those folks.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.420]  Tired of being invaded and enslaved.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]  We strike back, then it's the plan of how to burn down the police stations,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.420]  how to attack the military bases, and how to destroy the country.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.420]  And that's what they teach.
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.420]  Killing police.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:36.420]  Running around burning everything.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.420]  Using fireworks as a weapon.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.420]  Breaking into the police stations.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.420]  Getting the guns.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.420]  All of it a blueprint.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.420]  Put out by the French government, wanting this.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.420]  And then, of course, Macron gets to bring in martial law.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.420]  They use COVID.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.420]  Now they use this.
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.420]  And what do they do once they've carried this out?
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.420]  They arrest the French.
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.420]  The war has started.
[00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.420]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.420]  That show was called Athena.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.420]  Now, I just played the well-known Imam Tawahidi.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:27.420]  I always pronounce it wrong.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.420]  How do you pronounce it?
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.420]  I've seen this guy for a decade.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.420]  Tawahidi.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.420]  Imam Tawahidi on France, the West, and the Islamic extremism.
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.420]  You, France, went to the Muslim countries and imported the garbage
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.420]  the Muslim countries wanted to put in prison or isolate away from society.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:45.420]  Why?
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:50.420]  Not for cheap labor, but to be a group they control.
[00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.420]  And what have they done to the black community, or tried to?
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.420]  They tried to create the same thing.
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.420]  The globalists brag about all of this.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420]  Here it is.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.420]  It doesn't exist, according to the ADL.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.420]  They want you arrested.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.420]  If you say, they say, arrest anyone that says this exists.
[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.420]  This is just one of hundreds of documents at the UN website
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.420]  calling for an end to the white population, that whites are inherently bad.
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.420]  You see it all over the news.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.420]  Whites are bad, get rid of them.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.420]  That's what the universities teach.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.420]  You see it everywhere.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.420]  You know what they're pushing, because they already control the third world.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.420]  The globalists almost have the first world.
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.420]  If they can call middle class and rights and self-defense a cracker thing,
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.420]  well, then you're not going to want your own house, and your own car,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.420]  and your own mobility, and your own medicine, and your own children,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.420]  and your own life.
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:45.420]  Yes, evil Western dignity, evil, the evil everybody wanted.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.420]  They can make it racist and unfashionable, and they can make it illegal.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.420]  And how many French statesmen, how many French leaders,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.420]  tried to put Le Pen in prison three times?
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.420]  She faced trials for saying,
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.420]  we have an Islamic caliphate taking our country over.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.420]  We need to stop these numbers of bringing these Muslims in.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:07.420]  They're going to take over.
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.420]  Well, now they're doing it again.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.420]  Amid widespread rioting, France detains, that's arrest,
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.420]  soccer coach for making racist Islamophobic remarks.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.420]  Police in France responded to widespread rioting throughout the country
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.420]  by detaining a soccer coach and his son for allegedly uttering
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:29.420]  racist Islamophobic remarks a year ago.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:36.420]  Paris Saint-Germain's coach, Christopher Gaultier,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.420]  was held for questioning along with his son as part of a probe
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:42.420]  into alleged discrimination.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.420]  Yes, someone heard them say something once, yes.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.420]  So here's an interesting meme from the Wall Street Silver on Twitter.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.420]  Russia versus France, or France versus Russia.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.420]  A week ago, everyone thought it would be Russia having a civil war.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:04.420]  But where is the civil war now, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.420]  Red Square is there, and there's Paris, and it's spread all over Europe.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.420]  I also saw some weird leftist news articles in the U.S. saying,
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.420]  Macron's not a dictator.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.420]  He's a good guy.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.420]  He's not controlling the Internet.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.420]  Well, here's video of him in French announcing it.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.420]  The Internet kill switch.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.420]  What comes out of the riot?
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.420]  Silencing you.
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.420]  Macron is pulling social media down off the air.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:29.420]  Total censorship and ban on all reporting in France.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.420]  The French people will be unable to see outside the world
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.420]  and will not be able to hear them.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:37.420]  Translation, in the coming hours, we will take several measures,
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.420]  such as the removal of most sensitive content linked to these platforms,
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.420]  social networks.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.420]  Emmanuel Macron pinpoints the role and the place of social networks
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.420]  in the spread of violence in recent days.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.420]  It's not you bringing them in.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.420]  It's not your predecessors bringing them in.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.420]  It's not you destroying the sovereignty.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.420]  The EU says, we don't want to have any nation states.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.420]  We don't want the football teams to be national named.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.420]  And they're bringing in Muslims and others to break it all up
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.420]  because then once you've got 20% Muslims in every country,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.420]  they're now the majority when you add them all up.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:12.420]  There's more of them than Germans, than French, than Dutch, than Brits,
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.420]  than Scots, than Irish.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.420]  Understand, they're only 20% or so each country now, 10% in France,
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.420]  but the level's going up.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.420]  Once they hit 15%, 20%, they say at the UN,
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:27.420]  the Muslims will be the majority in a block when you add all the countries together
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420]  because there's only so many French or so many Germans.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.420]  They already have their cultures.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.420]  But see, there's the Muslim culture when it's 20% in every country.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.420]  You add all that together, it's a super majority.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.420]  And they'll vote with the socialists.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.420]  They'll vote with the globalists that brought them in.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:45.420]  And that's what he already tried to do two years ago,
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.420]  and Europe said no because it wasn't time yet.
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:54.420]  The leader, the dictator, whatever you want to call him, of Turkey, Erdogan,
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.420]  came out and said, I'm activating the Muslim party in Europe.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.420]  We are now the biggest party in Europe.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.420]  And when they looked at it,
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.420]  it would be 12% of the population of Western Europe was Muslim at that point.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.420]  And they will vote as a block.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.420]  Sunni, Shiite, doesn't matter.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.420]  Now you understand the game plan of veto
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.420]  because the French won't work with the Germans.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.420]  The Poles won't work with the Germans.
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.420]  All those countries have their own beefs, and they have their own countries,
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.420]  and that's good.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.420]  But you bring in the Muslims, and they are now the majority
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.420]  because it's a parliamentary system.
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:34.420]  That's how Trudeau only has 30% of the vote but is still the leader of Canada
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.420]  because you've got a dozen parties.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.420]  It's whatever group gets the largest piece.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.420]  We'll also look at it as a parliamentary system
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.420]  where the Muslims are the minority,
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.420]  but they're the majority when you add all the countries together.
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.420]  They have the biggest block.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.420]  That's the Kalergi plan.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.420]  That's what the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL do not want you to look up.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.420]  Now remember Klaus Schwab.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.420]  Let's play the clip in a moment.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.420]  We have to prepare for an angrier world,
[00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.420]  and as they cut off the food and resources in the third world,
[00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.420]  more will also come.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.420]  That's why 500,000, you played the clip two weeks ago,
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.420]  are marching towards the port in Tripoli,
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.420]  and they're loading on George Soros UN-funded ships and are coming in,
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:22.420]  and there's footage in Greece, in Spain, in Italy of huge Zodiacs
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.420]  that take a hundred people per boat just slamming in
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:31.420]  like it's the Allies invading Normandy on D-Day, but it's Islam,
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.420]  and they are Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar.
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.420]  They rape, they kill, they steal, they ram over people,
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.420]  and the left just loves it because it's their battering ram, their weapon,
[00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.420]  and they're just cheering them on.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.420]  Here's Klaus Schwab on the angrier world.
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:58.420]  We will see definitely a lot of anger already now,
[00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:01.420]  and probably increase by the end of the year,
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:07.420]  because ISIS will be with us until they really have found a remedy.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.420]  So we have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.420]  He also said when we cut the power off with a cyber attack,
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.420]  which I then said they blame on Patriots, which they now officially said,
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.420]  the Trump supporters will knock out the power in the United States,
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.420]  and we have to arrest them all.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.420]  So when they turn the power off, the news will say,
[00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.420]  well, your power has been off because of Trump and this guy,
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.420]  and that's where we're at.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.420]  So we're under asymmetrical 21st century warfare.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.420]  This is it.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.420]  And if you roll over, you're destroyed.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:41.420]  Or you could just say no to the New World Order,
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.420]  declare independence against it, and warn everybody you know,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.420]  and stop complying.
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.420]  We're this close to stopping these people,
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.420]  but they're throwing everything they've got at us.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.420]  They've activated their little Muslim garbage brigades.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.420]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.420]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.420]  This is the biggest sale of the year so far.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.420]  The July 4th super sales just started yesterday,
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.420]  up to 60% off and double Patriot points.

[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:02.420]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.420]  were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.420]  and take him off the air.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:08.420]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.420]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:11.420]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.420]  because they believed they could control him.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.420]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.420]  he was taken off the air.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.420]  It's the same thing with InfoWars.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.420]  But InfoWars is not owned by Fox

[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:23.420]  Only a few hundred bottles left.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.420]  But the good news is
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.420]  we have several thousand bottles left
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]  of Superfemale Vitality.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.420]  That's the same formula.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.420]  It boosts men.
[00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.420]  It boosts women.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.420]  It works great.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.420]  But women like pink labels.
[00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.420]  Men like different color labels.
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.420]  So it works for men as well.
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.420]  It's the same formula.
[00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.420]  It's an incredible formula
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.420]  and it funds our operation.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.420]  And here's another important part
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.420]  of the overall information.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.420]  It's 50% off for a limited time.

[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.420]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:08.870]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:29.420]  I was just thinking this morning about the New World Order's public plan to reduce population
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.900]  by 80% at least by the year 2030.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.420]  Now that's less than seven years away.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.300]  They've reached most of their previous goals.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.860]  They're a little bit behind right now.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:46.460]  But when you think about how they're trying to accelerate to catch up and what it'll take
[00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:51.660]  to get that number of dead people, you'd have to have massive wars, you'd have to have the
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:59.820]  major resources cut off, you'd have to have the fertilizer cut off.
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.580]  And I saw a really important video a few days ago on Patrick Bette David's show right after
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:10.580]  I was on it with the founder, a real scientist and environmentalist, the founder of Greenpeace,
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.580]  who really cares about the environment like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and he says, listen,
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.580]  I've analyzed what they're doing.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.300]  It's a plan to kill everybody.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.140]  Just the nitrogen cuts they've made so far are going to kill billions.
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.920]  You understand that, right?
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.820]  They have already cut nitrogen production by 25% in the last few years.
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.300]  BlackRock has, where they control companies.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.300]  They just shut it down.
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.300]  You go, well, that'll hurt them.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.300]  No, it won't.
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:41.140]  They're going to collapse society and then organize it with algorithms and fractional
[00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:47.300]  reserve banking and flash trades and all the rest of the systems they have to consolidate
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.700]  control while we circle the toilet bowl.
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:54.300]  I mean, this is full-on AI assault.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.300]  It's not coming.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.300]  It's already here.
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.220]  I was told by high-level folks three years ago, AI is already in control of everything
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.020]  basically when it comes to stock market and energy, and now it's designed to shut everything
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:09.180]  down for us, only leaving power systems on for them, literally.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.620]  That's why all the government districts and elite rich people districts, when the power
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.700]  went off in Texas during the ice storms, they never went off.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.980]  Same thing around the country.
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:23.420]  They make the decision to turn your power off and tell you it's a blackout, so you're
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:24.420]  not going to have power.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:28.180]  Like in South Africa, they get power three hours a day on average.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:35.060]  The rich ruling class areas always have power, so the rest of the city's off, but the government
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.420]  districts and their facilities and the military bases all got power.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:43.180]  It's the ultimate class system, so all they have is obsessing over black and white and
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.180]  all this.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.660]  They're taking all our parental rights.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:50.140]  They're taking the autonomy over our bodies.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:51.460]  They're saying they own our bodies.
[00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:52.700]  They've dissolved our borders.
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.260]  They're making us pay to be invaded.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:50:01.380]  They're euthanizing old people and young people.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.060]  They are mutilating children by the millions.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:10.020]  They are creating a dystopia on purpose, because if you think all the craziness you're seeing
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.340]  now is bad, what's it going to take in the next six and a half years to get to that?
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.340]  Because here's the thing.
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.940]  They were a little behind in 2021.
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.820]  They're a few years behind, so they've accelerated it, but they almost did what they said they
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:32.540]  wanted by 2020 under the UN Global Agreement and Treaty, Rio de Janeiro 1992.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:34.860]  That's agenda 2021.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:39.660]  Just like with the geoengineering, we talk about it, and they go, that doesn't exist.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:48.940]  There's no agenda 2020, agenda 21, but of course there is.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:52.660]  It's official, and so I'm just here telling you the enemy battle plan.
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:57.660]  It'd be like if alien spaceships came into orbit and were zapping cities that were blowing
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:02.420]  up, and I'm in some small town still in the air saying, hey, the alien craft are there.
[00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.140]  They just blew up New York City.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.940]  You can see New York's blown up, and then the aliens pop on the television and go, don't
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:08.940]  listen to him.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:09.940]  He's a liar.
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:11.260]  No one's blowing up your cities.
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.300]  And then the next city, Dallas, blows up.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.420]  You try to call your family in Dallas.
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.420]  It's disconnected.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.760]  I mean, we're being overrun.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.640]  We're being overtaken.
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:23.840]  They're shipping in drugs.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.160]  They're demoralizing us.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:29.320]  They're not teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic in the schools.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:35.520]  Half the schools in the United States have 90% illiteracy.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:43.880]  There are major districts in Illinois and in Maryland where not one student can pass.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.480]  They're great.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:51.400]  Not one student can pass the state exam.
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:52.400]  That's brainwashing.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.160]  They're dumbing down.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.160]  That's our civilization, folks.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:52:00.040]  And you go to Manhattan, you go to Chicago, you go to San Francisco, half the office buildings
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.080]  are empty.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.440]  They're not just laying people off.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.960]  People won't even work.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:07.960]  And then what's happening?
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.320]  I'll cover this next hour.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.680]  They are shutting down a third of the farms this year in the Netherlands, and the Netherlands
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.000]  produces a third, is the third largest food producer in the world.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.320]  It's a dynamo.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.760]  It's the green thumb of the planet.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.800]  Dutch farmers are hands down the best.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.820]  No one even says we're better.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.320]  They're the best.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.720]  They reclaim the ocean for more farmland.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]  My parents love to go to the Netherlands.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:40.280]  They go there all the time, and literally, in Holland, the countryside looks like a Walt
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.280]  Disney movie.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.640]  It looks like you're going to see Snow White any minute.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.440]  And they've done incredible things.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.500]  And by 2030, 90% of the farms will be shut.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.060]  So you bring in all the migrants.
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.180]  You won't let them have jobs in the third world or IMF World Bank rules.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.420]  You just shut them down.
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:02.300]  Then you bring them in, tell them white people are evil, and then you cut off the farms.
[00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:05.660]  Folks, two plus two equals four.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:10.060]  This is equaling mass starvation and collapse.
[00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:14.740]  And the globalists are building facilities in the middle of nowhere everywhere.
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:18.460]  They're buying rural ranches hundreds of miles away from nowhere.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.000]  They're buying Arctic redoubts.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.080]  They're buying private islands.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.880]  They're gearing up to sit back and watch us all kill each other.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.440]  That's what's crazy.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:35.120]  There's 450-something nuclear reactors that if one of them melts down, it's a chain reaction.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:38.400]  When society falls apart, there's bioweapons everywhere.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.520]  There's bioweapon labs everywhere.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.560]  There's giant billions of population.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.760]  When things finally collapse, none of those islands will be safe, no matter how big their
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.920]  security force is.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:54.560]  I mean, folks, I'm just here as long as I can be on air putting the final warnings in.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.680]  It's like I'm in the underground base going, Imperial troops have entered the base.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.720]  Imperial troops have entered the base.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.320]  I mean, I'm just like, ladies and gentlemen, good luck.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.320]  We've done as much as we can.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.320]  Prepare yourselves.
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.320]  It's already irreversible.
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.320]  Goodbye.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:09.840]  And remember, I was the crazy guy 20 years ago.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840]  It's all come true.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.680]  And now I say this, oh, maybe he's a little crazy.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.480]  No, you're like, no, he's not crazy.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.760]  And people like invite me to these big parties and Hollywood stuff.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:17.760]  I'm like, no thanks.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]  Bye bye.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.600]  Good to know you.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]  Have a fun time.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]  Well, Alex, why don't you want to come?
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.600]  Hang on.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]  I'm just getting ready for a total collapse.
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]  Okay.
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.600]  Please get ready.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.600]  None of this.
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:28.600]  None of this matters.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.600]  It's all over.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.600]  Okay.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.600]  I want to explain that to you.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.640]  It's like I got these stupid plaintiff's lawyers, Democratic Party and the CIA messing with me
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.640]  and doing all this stuff.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.640]  And they don't know why.
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.040]  I don't get upset.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.920]  Because it's all over, idiots.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.160]  It's all over.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.480]  It's all collapsing.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480]  You won.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.520]  You destroyed the West and your inferiority complex.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.880]  You triggered the French Revolution.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.440]  You'll be destroyed by it.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.440]  Congratulations.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.480]  I just want to go be with my family.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.480]  Great job.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.480]  Pedophilia is all over the news.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.760]  They tell us how great it is.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.280]  Wonderful job left.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:03.280]  Wonderful job.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.280]  New World Order.
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.280]  Fabulous job.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.280]  You've really done a great job.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:10.320]  Let me give the toll free number out and take your calls.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320]  How do we stop this?
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]  Can it be stopped?
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.880]  What are the globalists going to pull next?
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:16.480]  Over 100 cities are on fire right now.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.840]  John Bowne just filed a big report that's on Infowars.com that you should definitely
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:22.160]  share that lays this all out.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.640]  Let me put that on screen for TV viewers.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.640]  Go to Bandot Video.
[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.640]  Share it.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.600]  If we don't recognize we're in a crisis, if we don't recognize everything's collapsing,
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.920]  there's no chance of fixing it.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.840]  You've got to admit how bad it is.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.480]  It's not business as usual.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.360]  I just want to give them the title, please.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.000]  We can just show them the Bandot Video title.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000]  That would be superlative.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.200]  Because I don't, from memory, know the name of the John Bowne video, and I just want to
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.960]  plug it so people go get it, so people share it.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.960]  There it is.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.760]  French riots accelerate Muslim domination in the West.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:55.880]  But like Imam said, it's the prisoners.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]  It's the gangbangers.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.160]  It's the garbage of the Muslim countries brought in.
[00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:05.160]  That's who they want to now be the new majority, which they are when you look at them on a country
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.160]  by country basis.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.160]  They're not.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.840]  When you add them all together, they're the EU coalition.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.960]  They're the unifying force the EU has to bring down any nation anytime they want.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.440]  By snapping their fingers.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:20.400]  And when the French try to even speak out and say, this isn't working, you are arrested.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.520]  It's all ADL playing, ADL's basic quarterbacking.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.640]  And it's incredible.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.360]  And so just be aware of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.440]  And we're going to go to break.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.000]  The toll free number to join us on that subject.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:46.880]  We're taking first time callers, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:52.000]  I'm here doing my job, stand at my post, warning everybody, but understand, I'm not trying
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.320]  to scare you for no reason.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.320]  This is not hyperbole.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.040]  We're all in grave danger.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:01.560]  This is the design destruction of civilization, 877-789-2539 is the number.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.560]  Please don't forget.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.640]  The biggest sales so far in the year, double Patriot points, up to 60% off.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:10.920]  Incredible products like Nitric Boost, Super Female Vitality, works great on men.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:13.360]  It's the same formula, but we're sold out of the men's.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:16.480]  Great CBD oil, full spectrum, lowest price you're going to find.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.920]  Water filtration, all the storable food, 10% off.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.000]  That's a giant discount there because it's already super low priced.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.680]  Infowarsstore.com, almost sold out of Brain Force Ultra and Brain Force Plus.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.400]  Same thing with X3 if you want them.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:32.040]  They're all there at infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.040]  You need to stock up now.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.520]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.520]  Hour number two.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.520]  Your phone calls.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.020]  A ton of news straight ahead.
[00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.430]  InfoWars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:55.430]  And so, please, go to InfoWars store and just make a donation.
[00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.430]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[00:57:57.430 --> 00:58:00.430]  You have a little profile there, cancel anytime.
[00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:05.430]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:08.430]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.430]  whenever you want, you program it, you just click it,
[00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.430]  and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:16.430]  So please do that as well, that way we get 95% of it after credit card fees,
[00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:19.430]  instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:20.430]  But these really are amazing products.
[00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.430]  The big July 4th sale is going on right now.
[00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:25.430]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:27.430]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:28.430]  People are listening more than ever.
[00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.430]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.430]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:34.430]  I know times are tough.
[00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:36.430]  So thank you for your support.
[00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:39.430]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:41.430]  That you can do for free.
[00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.430]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.430]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:46.430]  please support us now.
[00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:48.430]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:49.430]  God bless you.
[00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:54.430]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?
[00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.430]  I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.
[00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.430]  So let me get this straight.
[00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:01.430]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight a document
[00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.430]  showing that during the Obama administration,
[00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:06.430]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son Hunter
[00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:10.430]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor that was investigating corruption,
[00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:12.430]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:15.430]  enforcing the arming of Ukraine,
[00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.430]  in turn setting the stage for the current war against Russia.
[00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:20.430]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.430]  which the FBI also had,
[00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.430]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:28.430]  and infiltrated social media to censor during the 2020 campaign,
[00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.430]  all while the FBI investigated Trump for having classified documents,
[00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:36.430]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off for a similar charge in 2016,
[00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:40.430]  when they were simultaneously launching the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:44.430]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:46.430]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:57.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:12.430]  As a result of the United Nations, the WEF, IMF,
[01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:16.430]  and the EU's intentionally disastrous open border policy,
[01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:20.430]  New World Order puppet French President Emmanuel Macron
[01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:26.430]  is forging ahead with the final stages of the Illuminati takedown of Western civilization.
[01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:29.430]  Here are the key elements of a global agenda.
[01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.430]  To deliver this agenda, we need cooperation,
[01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:35.430]  and especially we need cooperation between China and the US.
[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:41.430]  This is France right now, thanks to the mass immigration policy of Europe.
[01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:54.430]  How is looting Louis Vuitton stores advances the rights of minorities in France?
[01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:59.430]  How is chanting Allah Akbar while setting vehicles on fire is advancing your cause?
[01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:03.430]  It does if your cause is anarchy and radicalism.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:08.430]  One third of all the people arrested were young, sometimes very young people, he said,
[01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.430]  urging parents to keep them in tonight.
[01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:14.430]  He also blamed social media for fanning the protests,
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:18.430]  calling on internet companies to take down sensitive footage.
[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:22.430]  Of course, it's because of this video of the shooting death of 17-year-old Nael
[01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.430]  that so many are outraged.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.430]  He was the son of North African parents,
[01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:32.430]  and many believe his race made it easier for the officer to pull the trigger.
[01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:38.430]  Over 100 French cities have been affected by looting, rioting and random gunfire.
[01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:46.430]  45,000 security forces deployed, over 2,400 arrests, 2,500 fires set.
[01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:51.430]  While in Lyon, France alone, 27 police officers were injured,
[01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:58.430]  seven of those by shotgun fire in the fifth night of New World Order-driven anarchy.
[01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:03.430]  But the United Nations has voiced its concerns about French police.
[01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:08.430]  This is a moment for the country to seriously address the deep issues of racism
[01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.430]  and racial discrimination in law enforcement.
[01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.430]  According to a CSA poll for CNews,
[01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:19.430]  70% of France is favorable of restoring order with the army,
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:25.430]  as they have witnessed a terrifying 21st century Islamic crusade into Europe
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:29.430]  that has played out exponentially since 2015.
[01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:32.430]  After the murders at the headquarters of magazine Charlie Hebdo,
[01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.430]  France became a different, more nervous country,
[01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:39.430]  facing fundamental questions about free speech and religion.
[01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:44.430]  As that unfolded, another attack was launched on a Jewish supermarket
[01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.430]  in the east of the capital by a close friend of the Kouachi brothers.
[01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:52.430]  Ahmedi Kouloubali, who had also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State,
[01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:56.430]  took several hostages and killed four people.
[01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:59.430]  And the worst fears were realized in November 2015,
[01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:04.430]  when 130 people were killed in one terrible evening in Paris
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:08.430]  at the Bataclan concert hall and in nearby bars.
[01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:13.430]  It was the worst attack in France since the Second World War.
[01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:18.430]  It is said that in 2050, Muslims in France will outnumber the French.
[01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:21.430]  But it is not these numbers that we are counting on
[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.430]  to turn France into an Islamic country.
[01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:30.430]  Thus, the rule of Islam will spread to the entire world in one of three ways.
[01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:34.430]  Conversion to Islam, payment of the Jizya poll tax,
[01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:39.430]  or we will ask for Allah's help until the entire world is subject to the rule of Islam.
[01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:47.430]  There will come a day that we will see far more radical extremists and terrorists
[01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:54.430]  coming out of Europe because of lack of decision making,
[01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.430]  trying to be politically correct,
[01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:02.430]  or assuming that they know the Middle East and they know Islam
[01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.430]  and they know the others far better than we do.
[01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:09.430]  And I'm sorry, but that's pure ignorance.
[01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:13.430]  Check out this map. It shows all the documented terror attacks since 9-11.
[01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:15.430]  And one thing really stands out.
[01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:20.430]  There is one solitary country in the heart of Europe with not a single red dot,
[01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:24.430]  not one terror attack in the last 20 odd years.
[01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:27.430]  And that country is Poland, my homeland.
[01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:30.430]  How many refugees has Poland taken?
[01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:32.430]  Zero.
[01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:35.430]  This is the new world order on the march
[01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:40.430]  as security is traded for compassionate anarchic diversity,
[01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:44.430]  steadily manifesting order out of chaos into being.
[01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:46.430]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:51.430]  That is a very important report. It's at man.video. It's at Infowars.com.
[01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.430]  Get it and share it. It's an Infowar.
[01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:55.430]  If you don't take action, we're going to fail.
[01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:57.430]  Take action now!
[01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.430]  Infowars is a one-of-a-kind operation.
[01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:05.430]  And so please, go to Infowars store and just make a donation.
[01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.430]  And you can make it one time or recurring.
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:10.430]  You have a little profile there, cancelling time.
[01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:15.430]  Every 15 days, every month, every 3 months, every 6 months, up to 9 months,
[01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:18.430]  you can go in and every month or every week,
[01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:20.430]  whenever you want, you program it.
[01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.430]  You just click it and then you decide when you want to make a donation.
[01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:24.430]  So please do that as well.
[01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.430]  That way we get 95% of it after credit card fees.
[01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:29.430]  Instead of making 20, 30, 40% like we do on the products.
[01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:31.430]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:33.430]  The big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.430]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.430]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:39.430]  People are listening more than ever.
[01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:41.430]  But in this major recession, going into depression,
[01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:44.430]  and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:45.430]  I know times are tough.
[01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:47.430]  So thank you for your support.
[01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:50.430]  But whatever you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:52.430]  That you can do for free.
[01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:54.430]  This is important.
[01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.430]  So however God leads you in your heart to support us,
[01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.430]  please support us now.
[01:05:57.430 --> 01:05:59.430]  And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:00.430]  God bless you.
[01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:31.430]  Isn't it rich?
[01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:36.430]  Isn't it queer?
[01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:45.430]  Losing my timing this late in my career.
[01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:53.430]  Where are the clowns?
[01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:59.430]  There ought to be clowns.
[01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:05.430]  Well, maybe next year.
[01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:09.430]  If you're a TV viewer, you see some excerpts from The Joker.
[01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:13.430]  And if you watch that movie, from what, four years ago now,
[01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:16.430]  the whole thing is about rioting and killing police and burning buildings
[01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:19.430]  and how sexy and cool it is.
[01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:24.430]  And then six months, a year later, we go into the summer of rage
[01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:28.430]  and billions of dollars of things burned and hundreds total killed.
[01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:32.430]  So this is the ruling megabanks, BlackRock,
[01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:37.430]  using social media and weaponized Netflix and HBO and all of it
[01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:43.430]  to practice terrorizing the general population of America
[01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:47.430]  into accepting their leftist demands.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.430]  When they say defund the police, they mean let them be leftist controlled.
[01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:53.430]  And look, I don't say this to patronize because I just say the facts here.
[01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.430]  I have no white guilt.
[01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.430]  I love everybody at the same time.
[01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:57.430]  I'm a Christian.
[01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:01.430]  The biggest recipient of this defund the police,
[01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:07.430]  and when I say recipient of crime and death, has been Black people.
[01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:10.430]  Every day you see a mass shooting where Black people kill Black people.
[01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:13.430]  There was like five of them over the weekend.
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:15.430]  Dozens dead, hundreds shot.
[01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:19.430]  Hell, a hundred shot at one event.
[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:24.430]  Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland, Miami.
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:33.430]  Hundreds shot, dozens dead.
[01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:38.430]  And now the crime just bubbles up everywhere.
[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:40.430]  So the globalists know exactly what they're doing,
[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.430]  creating their angrier world that Klaus Schwab has talked about.
[01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:52.430]  But there are shots of entire car parks with thousands of cars burning up.
[01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:58.430]  And in one case in Paris, a lot of thousands of cars stacked one on top of the other all burn up.
[01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.430]  You know what's interesting about the car I looked at?
[01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:06.430]  These are electric cars.
[01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:07.430]  Why is that important?
[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:12.430]  Well, in China, you can search engine this, there are millions of unused, unsold.
[01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:15.430]  Did I say millions?
[01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:18.430]  Last number is over five million unsold electric cars.
[01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:20.430]  They just still warehouse them and the government says they sold them
[01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:28.430]  because they get giant UN, IMF, World Bank funds and BlackRock ESG money, billions.
[01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:35.430]  The number I saw was three billion for being the number one EV car maker in the world.
[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.430]  They actually don't have the EV charging stations.
[01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.430]  The Chinese don't like them.
[01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:39.430]  They know they run out of power.
[01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:40.430]  They cost more.
[01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.430]  They don't work.
[01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:44.430]  But you just make the cars and then there's these photos and videos with drones
[01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:50.430]  of just fields full of tens of thousands of electric cars rotting.
[01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:55.430]  But in France, a big facility with thousands of them burns up.
[01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.430]  You know all the fires aren't the Muslims.
[01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.430]  And I'm not, again, defending the Muslims.
[01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:02.430]  I'm trying to be fact-based here.
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:07.430]  The globalists are going to use the crises to torch things they want to get rid of,
[01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:12.430]  just like the left goes out and burns food processing plants and slaughterhouses all the time,
[01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.430]  Animal Liberation Front and other groups.
[01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:17.430]  But then you notice suddenly all these other facilities go up in smoke.
[01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:22.430]  It's because no one from the Justice Department is investigating the arson.
[01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.430]  So there's a green light now to burn your business down and get the insurance money.
[01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.430]  Everybody's starting to check out.
[01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:30.430]  People figured out civilization's going down.
[01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.430]  So more and more people are giving up.
[01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:33.430]  They're not going to work.
[01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:34.430]  They're milking the paycheck.
[01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.430]  But they're not thinking about what happens once it goes down.
[01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:40.430]  That's why I'm still here on air.
[01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.430]  That's why I'm still fighting.
[01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:47.430]  But I am now quietly getting ready myself.
[01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:51.430]  I've always been 100% offense, no defense.
[01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:55.430]  I'm now 20% defense because I have responsibility to my family.
[01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.430]  And I try to talk to my family who are smarter than most folks,
[01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.430]  but they still have a comfort bias, a normalcy bias.
[01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:05.430]  And I'm literally going to their houses, cousins and other people.
[01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:06.430]  Most of them are veterans.
[01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:07.430]  They're not stupid.
[01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.430]  And I'm like, get ready.
[01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.430]  And they're like, no, we know.
[01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:12.430]  I'm just like, well, we've got to get ready right now.
[01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:14.430]  We've got to have more than the shotgun, the rifle, and the four-wheel drive.
[01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.430]  We've got to have solar.
[01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:16.430]  We've got to have gas.
[01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.430]  We've got to have electric bikes.
[01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:20.430]  We've got to have generators.
[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.430]  We've got to have fuel on site.
[01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:22.430]  We've got to have fuel additives.
[01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:24.430]  We've got to have to store it.
[01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:25.430]  We've got to have farms.
[01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:26.430]  We've got to have gardens.
[01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:29.430]  And we're doing it.
[01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.430]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, the system isn't going to save you
[01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:34.430]  and isn't going to be there when this goes down.
[01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:38.430]  And it's a really hard pill to swallow, and I get it.
[01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:41.430]  But I'm a guy that's 100% offense, because that's the most important thing,
[01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:42.430]  to defeat the enemy.
[01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:45.430]  But I realize now we're going to have a collapse.
[01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:48.430]  In fact, we're already in the collapse.
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:51.430]  So it's like you're driving through a green light, and you go,
[01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.430]  oh, my goodness, that guy just ran that red light.
[01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.430]  He's going 50 miles an hour.
[01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:57.430]  Oh, my Lord, please don't let me get hurt.
[01:11:57.430 --> 01:12:00.430]  Boom, you're spinning through the intersection off the side of the road.
[01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:01.430]  You've got a concussion.
[01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:02.430]  Your nose is bleeding.
[01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:04.430]  But the seatbelt, the airbags deploy.
[01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:05.430]  This happened to me once.
[01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:07.430]  And you stumble out of the car.
[01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.430]  Well, at least I'm not dead.
[01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:11.430]  So we're in the intersection.
[01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:13.430]  The car is going 50 miles an hour.
[01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.430]  We're going 20, and we're just like, oh, man.
[01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:19.430]  So, look, I don't know how bad it's going to be.
[01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:21.430]  We're getting hit, okay?
[01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:25.430]  Let's just get that 100% straight in our brains.
[01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:28.430]  There's no stopping the collapse now.
[01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:34.430]  But if we work hard, the globalists won't come out on top of this collapse
[01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:37.430]  as the bosses to bring in a tyranny a thousand times worse.
[01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:39.430]  And that's their admitted plan.
[01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:42.430]  So we better be fighting as hard as we can
[01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:46.430]  and fighting five times harder than these devils
[01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:49.430]  to be affecting the battle space psychologically with the truth,
[01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:51.430]  exposing that they did it.
[01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.430]  They're the ones behind it.
[01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:55.430]  Here's what they're going to try once the collapse accelerates
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:58.430]  so people don't comply with them during the collapse
[01:12:58.430 --> 01:13:00.430]  because they're going to release a new virus
[01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:04.430]  and be locking people up and promising to bring back the good times
[01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:07.430]  if you just take your shot or, oh, if your neighbor went away
[01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:10.430]  but Bob was causing a problem and not going along with it.
[01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:11.430]  They're the noncompliers.
[01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.430]  You'll get your electricity back once you comply.
[01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:16.430]  And, of course, down the road at the military base,
[01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.430]  they'll have electricity.
[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.430]  They'll have food.
[01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:19.430]  You won't.
[01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.430]  Two and two, put it together.
[01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:26.430]  You're being put in the process of being once free, now being a slave.
[01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:28.430]  They think you're weak.
[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:31.430]  They think you're stupid.
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.430]  The military down there is not going to be heroes.
[01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.430]  They're going to be young people following orders
[01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:40.430]  just like the ones at the border bringing the illegal aliens in and the smuggled kids.
[01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.430]  I don't hate the military.
[01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:44.430]  I don't hate the Border Patrol, but they're just like average Americans.
[01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:47.430]  They follow criminal orders.
[01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:49.430]  Nobody's coming to save you but yourself.
[01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:51.430]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:52.430]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:56.430]  Nobody's coming to save you.
[01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:59.430]  And you see most of the zombies out there
[01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:04.430]  not realizing that their instinctive move to give up.
[01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:07.430]  Because under communism, people always give up once they figure out,
[01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:10.430]  I work all day and I don't even get enough food to eat.
[01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.430]  So I'll just stop working.
[01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:13.430]  I'll just be lazy.
[01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:14.430]  That's why communism always falls.
[01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:15.430]  It takes a decade or so.
[01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.430]  But it doesn't work like that now.
[01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:19.430]  The enemy has giant stockpiles of food and weapons.
[01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:20.430]  They have drones.
[01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:21.430]  They have robots.
[01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:22.430]  They have it all planned.
[01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.430]  They want us to all die.
[01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:27.430]  So they're not going to like the communists that finally fall
[01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.430]  because they had to live off us.
[01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:33.430]  They're going to be offshore watching us all completely fall.
[01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:35.430]  So we need to let the police and military know,
[01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:37.430]  like our lives depend on it,
[01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:40.430]  that if they go along with the next phase of orders,
[01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:43.430]  it's over for everybody.
[01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:45.430]  And then I don't want violence,
[01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:49.430]  but it's going to turn into once there's no food and water even at the bases,
[01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:53.430]  they're going to have maps of who's got food, who's dug in, who's ready,
[01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:56.430]  and then they're going to be coming to get your food.
[01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.430]  And let me explain.
[01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.430]  They're not going to be coming.
[01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:02.430]  This came out in the Sunshine Project 30 years ago,
[01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:05.430]  and it got reclassified when the Marine Corps freaked out.
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:09.430]  There was a joint Army-Marine Corps plan in every major state
[01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:15.430]  with helicopters that had basically fentanyl bottles on them
[01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.430]  that could knock out the entire –
[01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.430]  I mean one helicopter could knock out 20,000 people or more,
[01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:21.430]  depending on the density of the people.
[01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:22.430]  They would fly over and spray you.
[01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.430]  They found it would cause a lot of fires, a lot of death,
[01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:27.430]  that around 10% of people they sprayed would end up dying in a car wreck
[01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.430]  or die of fire ants if you fall in your yard and there's ants,
[01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:32.430]  and stuff like that,
[01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:35.430]  that 10% when they spray fentanyl on you to knock out a city,
[01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.430]  like in the movie – skip the break, guys.
[01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:40.430]  Sorry, I didn't do this to tell you quick enough.
[01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:42.430]  Close encounters of third kind.
[01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:45.430]  Third kind, they fly around with helicopters to spray everybody
[01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:49.430]  to make sure that nobody's awake when the UFOs land.
[01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:50.430]  That's fictional.
[01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:53.430]  In the real world, they've got – this is 30 years ago.
[01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:55.430]  They've got helicopters in underground little bases
[01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:58.430]  that just the base opens up and a helicopter comes out,
[01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:01.430]  and the person flying it has been told –
[01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:05.430]  usually they're flying missions to eradicate moths or spray this or that.
[01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.430]  They're told, hey, go over to these cities and spray this.
[01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:11.430]  And they go do it, and everybody in there, if you're in your bed,
[01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.430]  you're lucky enough you just sleep for seven, eight hours,
[01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:15.430]  but in your car, in your kitchen, you're going to fall,
[01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:17.430]  hit your head, you're going to die.
[01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:19.430]  But that's just training wheels.
[01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.430]  It won't – you're just like, well, the pilots are going to say no.
[01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:27.430]  They're not going to fly the opiate gas.
[01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:29.430]  Oh, of course they're not.
[01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:33.430]  So we can extrapolate out from the enemy program, and I can tell you,
[01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:38.430]  they've got drones, large drones, and small drones everywhere,
[01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:41.430]  already pre-positioned, and they've got them loaded with different things.
[01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.430]  But in most cases, once they go red on us,
[01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:49.430]  they're not going to be spraying us with fentanyl or things even worse.
[01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:52.430]  They're going to be spraying you with the most deadly nerve gas you've ever seen.
[01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:55.430]  You're going to die within 30 seconds of getting hit.
[01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:59.430]  Convulsing so bad, you're going to break the joints in your body.
[01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:04.430]  You're going to vomit and crap everything out, and you're going to hit the ground dead.
[01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:06.430]  Now, they're going to launch these in their attack grids.
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:09.430]  They're going to come in, and they're going to hit the small towns, everything,
[01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:11.430]  and they're just going to kill you.
[01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:12.430]  So that's what's going to happen.
[01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:13.430]  Sorry to have to tell you.
[01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.430]  So here's the good news, though.
[01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.430]  All my enemies, you're dead, too.
[01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:22.430]  I am doing my best job to stop this, but I have the satisfaction
[01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:25.430]  they're going to get all the pink and purple hair people.
[01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.430]  I don't care they have pink and purple hair.
[01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:30.430]  It's that they're pedos, they're leftists, they love Satan, they love death,
[01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:31.430]  they think everything's funny.
[01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.430]  You're going to know it's funny.
[01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:35.430]  Just remember, when you're in your kitchen, you go,
[01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:37.430]  oh, nerve gas.
[01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:38.430]  Just remember, it's nerve gas.
[01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:42.430]  But you're so stupid, you won't know they've got thousands and thousands
[01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:45.430]  of drones and drone helicopters ready with the nerve gas
[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:49.430]  to kill you and your family right now.
[01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:52.430]  All this talk is you're going to shoot the U.N. troops.
[01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:55.430]  Our military is under U.N. command.
[01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:58.430]  The U.N. is setting up the treaties to be in charge of your health care
[01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.430]  in the hospital.
[01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.430]  They don't march around in blue helmets.
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:03.430]  They're already in control.
[01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.430]  They run the border patrol.
[01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.430]  They run everything.
[01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:14.430]  Just keep pretending, everybody, that we aren't overrun.
[01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:18.430]  Only admitting we're overrun is going to stop this.
[01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:20.430]  But I've looked at the numbers, and there's so much incompetence,
[01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:25.430]  even by the robots and their supply chain, that even if they do an A-plus attack,
[01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:28.430]  there'll be tens of millions of Americans that survive,
[01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.430]  and I just want you to know that you need to be getting lists
[01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:33.430]  of where the globalists are now in their armored fortresses
[01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:35.430]  because we will beat them in the end.
[01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:36.430]  Obviously, I won't be here.
[01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:40.430]  Most of us won't be here to do it, but just some of you listening now
[01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:44.430]  and some of you will be able to tell people now we will get them in the end.
[01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:45.430]  That's what matters.
[01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:47.430]  But, see, I'm having to now extrapolate out.
[01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:49.430]  That's why I keep telling you.
[01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.430]  I told you months ago I took off time to say what the future is
[01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:53.430]  and what's the next thing to come because I'm not just here to go,
[01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:54.430]  oh, look, I was right about this.
[01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:55.430]  I was right about that.
[01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:56.430]  Oh, look, I told you this.
[01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.430]  That came true.
[01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:59.430]  And just, oh, look how so.
[01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.430]  None of this means anything.
[01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:07.430]  I'm sitting there going, do I really tell people what I think is going to happen next,
[01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:12.430]  what I know?
[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:16.430]  Because that's where I am right now.
[01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:22.430]  You have a psychotic compartmentalized government that, with dose ranging,
[01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:28.430]  sent out placebos to leftist areas but still dosed 5%, 10% with poison.
[01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.430]  They'll kill a few so it wouldn't be too obvious.
[01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:35.430]  And then hit conservative populist Christian areas with poison shots
[01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:39.430]  that maimed and killed millions.
[01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:44.430]  And you think I'm wild telling you they got robot drones and helicopters ready?
[01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:48.430]  Loaded with the nerve gas right now.
[01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:51.430]  Nerve gas, nerve gas, nerve gas.
[01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:53.430]  Learn about nerve gas a little bit.
[01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:54.430]  Just a little bit.
[01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:59.430]  Learn a little bit about nerve gas because it's probably what's going to kill you.
[01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:01.430]  That's their plan.
[01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.430]  They're not going to have some bioweapon they can't control.
[01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:05.430]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:07.430]  It's nerve gas.
[01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:11.430]  And I'm not talking about Agent Orange from World War I.
[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:15.430]  That just burns your face and your lungs and kills you half the time.
[01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:19.430]  That takes a couple hours to kill you usually if you get hit directly with it.
[01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:26.430]  No, I'm talking about something far more enjoyable for all of you.
[01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:30.430]  It's going to break every muscle and tendon in your body when you can vault so hard
[01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:35.430]  and you'll be a little ball just like a dead roach with its legs and arms all in.
[01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:38.430]  You see how a roach looks when you've nerve gassed it?
[01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:39.430]  It's been nerve gassed.
[01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:41.430]  It's like this.
[01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:43.430]  Well, that's how you're going to be.
[01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:48.430]  And I say, hey, if God wants to judge us with this, then just nerve gas away.
[01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:52.430]  At least the children will die quickly instead of being chopped up in their mother's womb
[01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:54.430]  when the babies fight the scalpels and fight for their lives
[01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:58.430]  or when they keep them alive and then harvest their organs later after they're born
[01:20:58.430 --> 01:21:06.430]  or when they keep them alive with their children and cut their genitals off.
[01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:09.430]  In fact, maybe we should just create a church that worships the New World Order
[01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.430]  and just begs the AI to nerve gases.
[01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:18.430]  Oh, AI God, oh, Bill Gates, nerve gas us, you're such a genius.
[01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:23.430]  He's a psychotic demon.
[01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:24.430]  We have to roll over to him, don't we?
[01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:26.430]  Because we just can't stand up.
[01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:32.430]  We just don't have what it takes.
[01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:36.430]  I'm really upset now.
[01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:37.430]  You know what happens?
[01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:40.430]  I get in here and I research the news.
[01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:42.430]  Almost all these articles I send to the crew,
[01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:45.430]  almost all these articles I scan them or read part of them or read all of them,
[01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:48.430]  the videos I watched, and I just get so upset.
[01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:56.430]  Just shutting farms down saying farms are bad for the earth
[01:21:56.430 --> 01:22:00.430]  and now nitrogen must be banned?
[01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:05.430]  I mean, if we're that stupid, we deserve to die.
[01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:08.430]  The atmosphere is almost completely nitrogen for those that didn't know.
[01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:13.430]  What is it, 90%?
[01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:19.430]  They want to ban nitrogen.
[01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:23.430]  Oh, but they legalized it last year with no congressional approval, no debate,
[01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:29.430]  putting nitrogen in your food.
[01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:33.430]  And we're so stunned and poisoned now, we don't even know what hit us.
[01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:37.430]  And then I watch the spirit cooking videos that they've released
[01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:42.430]  where Alex Soros goes and they're doing these weird devil worshiper rituals
[01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:46.430]  and they're such nerds, they're so wimpy.
[01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:49.430]  They're so pathetic and stupid and uncool.
[01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:53.430]  And we're like, let these devil worshipers run everything?
[01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:55.430]  These weak nobodies?
[01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:59.430]  I mean, we just let them sit back and hit us with fluoride, GMO, and 5G
[01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.430]  and they're like these weird little chicken necks.
[01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:07.430]  You could break their neck with one hand.
[01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.430]  And they're just so into what they're doing to us,
[01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:11.430]  so into how they're annihilating us,
[01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:16.430]  and so into how we're blind and just take it, and take it, and take it,
[01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:21.430]  and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it,
[01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:24.430]  and take it, and take it again, and take it again.
[01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:30.430]  And we love it!
[01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:38.430]  So let me do this.
[01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:44.110]  phone calls and then I'll get into the cutting off the resources all the rest
[01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:49.269]  of that it's just so unbelievable but you know what CBS said and Leningrady
[01:23:49.269 --> 01:23:53.190]  remember there's nothing worse than organic now actually nothing worse than
[01:23:53.190 --> 01:23:58.230]  grass-fed beef nothing worse than then then totally natural tomatoes we're
[01:23:58.230 --> 01:24:02.190]  gonna pan don't worry though we've got factories that make bugs there that Bill
[01:24:02.190 --> 01:24:07.350]  Gates says is good well if it's good I'm gonna eat the bugs but let's play the
[01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:11.269]  Imam again I don't know to play a clip twice in one show but we're gonna play
[01:24:11.269 --> 01:24:13.750]  this today and then we'll play Trump right after it where he predicted this
[01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:19.389]  2016 it was already happening it wasn't really prediction you France went to the
[01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:22.750]  Muslim countries and imported the garbage that the Muslim countries wanted to put
[01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:27.150]  in prison or isolate away from society why Imam
[01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:33.309]  Tawhidi on France and the West and Islamic extremism here it is funny
[01:24:33.309 --> 01:24:40.990]  enough the IRGC cannot operate in Saudi Arabia their supporters cannot have bank
[01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:46.910]  accounts in the UAE the other extremist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood who
[01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:51.990]  are friends with IRGC and Hezbollah people they cannot operate in Bahrain
[01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:57.030]  in Oman these are Muslim countries where do they operate in London in France in
[01:24:57.030 --> 01:25:02.670]  Washington DC in Australia in Canada Toronto they operate here they
[01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:09.710]  have bank accounts they register charity right so Macron the president of
[01:25:09.710 --> 01:25:18.190]  France recently said the Islamic world is in a crisis in my opinion yeah we do
[01:25:18.190 --> 01:25:23.910]  have problems we do have Boko Haram we have Al-Qaeda we have Taliban we have
[01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:27.870]  problems but the broader picture Islam is very successful it's growing very
[01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:35.990]  fast and we're doing really well Dubai is not in a crisis Abu Dhabi the UAE
[01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:40.430]  Bahrain Oman Kuwait there's no crisis there the Muslim countries are doing
[01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:47.630]  good there only some places there's a problem I say no you are in a crisis you
[01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:55.150]  went to the Muslim countries and you imported the garbage that the Muslim
[01:25:55.150 --> 01:26:01.990]  countries wanted to put in prison or isolate away from society you went and
[01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:07.710]  you imported them why for cheap labor but these Islamist extremists they don't
[01:26:07.710 --> 01:26:12.469]  want to work they want free welfare they want to marry French women blonde hair
[01:26:12.469 --> 01:26:18.790]  blue eyes they don't have time to work so look at Poland they don't complain
[01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:23.630]  from Islamic extremism not a single terrorist attack in Poland the moment
[01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:28.430]  they sense there's a problem they crack down on it Polish policy beautiful the
[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:35.230]  French no come when they come they use the resources they go to Washington DC
[01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:41.830]  and they sit in Congress they support the Iranian regime they go against the
[01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:50.150]  sanctions in Congress right with their hijab why because the ideology is filth
[01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:57.870]  to begin with when you import that or you allow it in or you amplify it or you
[01:26:57.870 --> 01:27:04.309]  glorify it in any way you make your bed sleep in it so that is also a problem of
[01:27:04.309 --> 01:27:11.510]  the West the question is Tina did the extremists become stronger or the West
[01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:17.309]  become weaker I say I wouldn't go to France I wouldn't go to France because
[01:27:17.469 --> 01:27:24.389]  France is no longer France France is no longer France they won't like me for
[01:27:24.389 --> 01:27:30.350]  saying that France is no longer France and this world better be very careful
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:38.070]  and they better get very tough and very smart that was six years ago six and a
[01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:42.230]  half years ago almost seven years ago seems like five minutes ago also a
[01:27:42.230 --> 01:27:48.190]  lifetime ago paradoxically but you're not supposed to say France is a hellhole
[01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:54.070]  but it is now except in the countryside and France was incredible just 10-15
[01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:57.549]  years ago it is it is a joke now and I don't say that with pleasure like
[01:27:57.549 --> 01:28:03.010]  California is a joke I'm sad California was a great state Michigan used to be an
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:09.150]  amazing state it's a total joke now the left ruins everything it touches because
[01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.750]  it affiliates with crime and garbage and there's white garbage and there's
[01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:15.590]  Christian garbage and there's Muslim garbage there's brown garbage there's
[01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:19.590]  you know there's garbage of every group but it's true we have imported the

[01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:51.990]  right back with our number two
[01:31:57.469 --> 01:32:03.830]  in the early 1900s certain companies were off gassing highly toxic fluoride
[01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:07.950]  gases into the atmosphere the surrounding communities began to get
[01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:13.710]  sick laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers to
[01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:18.430]  convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid still highly toxic but
[01:32:18.430 --> 01:32:23.110]  containable now these companies had a stockpile of this poison and there was
[01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:26.790]  no affordable way to dispose of it lucky for them one of their major
[01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:31.670]  stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury who was responsible for the
[01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:36.830]  Public Health Service at the time and by 1950 the US government began buying
[01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:41.469]  this toxic untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our
[01:32:41.469 --> 01:32:46.350]  drinking water reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and
[01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:51.790]  other disease with the Alexa pure pro you can have clean drinking water and a
[01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:58.950]  remedy to this madness available now at info or store.com
[01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:07.830]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:27.830]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the frontlines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:35.830]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls right now, but I'm just going to be completely honest with you. That's my superpower.
[01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:47.830]  I don't know how I continue to do a show in a world this dangerous and insane and just act like everything's normal and just be a commentator, a spectator on the destruction of civilization.
[01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:56.830]  And I'm not criticizing myself or you or anybody else. I'm saying maybe we should do a whole show on this because my process I know is your process. We're all similar.
[01:33:56.830 --> 01:34:10.830]  How do you handle a psychotic ruling class trying to destroy civilization and even going against their own human interest and just doing insane dangerous things everywhere?
[01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:21.830]  And they've got it set up where the public is so dumbed down that even if you wiped out the top couple hundred globalists they've got ten deep minions ready to take over and some of them are worse.
[01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:31.830]  Well, you pull out of the system, you build your own thing, you get close to God. I mean I know that, but there is just a real frustration here.
[01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:39.830]  I mean you understand all over the world they're announcing plans and they're doing it from Ireland to all over Africa.
[01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:49.830]  They're telling people you can't grow your crops, your crops are bad. They're not even using fertilizer from nitrogen which is good.
[01:34:49.830 --> 01:35:01.830]  I mean that's so criminal, it's so obvious, it's so ridiculous, but it's like saying two men can have a baby and we're going to cut an eight-year-old's penis off because he got confused by the school.
[01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:07.830]  I mean it's already a ten out of ten. It's already maximum crazy town.
[01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:17.830]  And this new nitrogen thing, I mean I played it a month ago, John Kerry with his weird snake tongue thing where he sticks his tongue out every time he says something.
[01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:27.830]  He's like, I mean I'm like what the hell is this and he's up there going nitrogen is a problem, we've got to ban it and all the fertilizer and that's how we feed people.
[01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:31.830]  If we don't ban the fertilizer, people will starve. He actually said that.
[01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:37.830]  It's like if you give a man water in the desert, he'll die of thirst, he'll die of dehydration.
[01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:43.830]  If you drink plenty of water, we need to take the water away. I mean it's like boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
[01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:51.830]  I mean that's what they're doing though. They're just jamming us with just the most insane idiocy.
[01:35:52.830 --> 01:36:01.830]  And the fake statistics, I saw that all over the news yesterday. Crime dropped by 50% when we defunded the police.
[01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:09.830]  The crime shot off the charts, but the FBI two years ago stopped counting big city crime, period.
[01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:20.830]  They don't collate it now. I mean but I know that, you know that, but the average person driving along by tent cities and muggings and wherever.
[01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:26.830]  The crime just doesn't exist now. And you're like well that's not what's happening.
[01:36:26.830 --> 01:36:33.830]  It's cuckoo folks, it's cuckoo. And I'm just being how I really feel here.
[01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:40.830]  So I'm always trying to be a straight shooter, but I'll kind of control myself and sit up here as a broadcaster.
[01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:47.830]  I'm done doing that. And I'm done with everybody. I never lie. I mean I'm really good about not lying.
[01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:54.830]  I've gotten very good about it. But I do hold back, which is a form of lying. I'm not doing it anymore.
[01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:59.830]  I'm not holding back with anybody I work with, nobody in my family, nobody.
[01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:07.830]  I am removing, I'm asking God to help me do it, the filter 100%. There was still 10% of a filter left.
[01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:11.830]  The last bits of the filter are being blown out the tailpipe right now.
[01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:21.830]  You're getting Alex Jones 2.0 because I'm done. I'm going to tell you exactly what I think and that's it.
[01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:28.830]  Because watching this world burn down is not fun. I'm not one of these little Satanists that think this is all cute.
[01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:33.830]  And all the things they're doing to people, how they're treating our old people, how they're treating our children,
[01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:39.830]  how they're treating our veterans, it pisses me off because you know what, I go that's going to be me next.
[01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:43.830]  It's a very selfish thing folks. Empathy, everybody advertises it as something loving, wonderful.
[01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:47.830]  No, no. I mean I have it where I feel bad for them, that's because I'm wired upright.
[01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:51.830]  When I see somebody getting screwed over, I'm like that's me. You're doing that to me.
[01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:55.830]  These damn Satanists don't even have that connection. That's why they get destroyed.
[01:37:55.830 --> 01:38:02.830]  They aren't even connected to other people. They think it's normal to think it's funny to see somebody get hurt.
[01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:07.830]  Well, we're going to hurt you, don't you worry, once we get control of the system.
[01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:10.830]  And not because we want to step on you, you're disgusting, we don't want to touch you,
[01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:15.830]  but we're going to keep you from hurting innocent people in the future, you got a guarantee from me.
[01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:17.830]  Or I'm going to die trying.
[01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:25.830]  All right, I said what I'm going to say, I said I'd take your calls, I'm going to skip the next break so we can get the callers.
[01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:29.830]  Callers, I'm going to give you each two minutes, just make your point, I'll go to the next person.
[01:38:29.830 --> 01:38:35.830]  And I appreciate you calling today. I gave the number out 45 minutes ago or 38 minutes ago or whatever it was,
[01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:41.830]  into the last hour. And I just said, what do you think of the world? Do you see how they're setting it on fire?
[01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:46.830]  Do you see how they're cutting the energy off and dissolving the borders and bankrupting the systems
[01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:50.830]  and funding the criminals and just everything is to create crises.
[01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:54.830]  And have you figured out, they're just getting started, boys and girls.
[01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:58.830]  And they're getting us punch drunk. We're like, well, that's not normal, that's not good.
[01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:01.830]  And then it just gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:05.830]  While the globalists like Zuckerberg sit there eating popcorn in Kauai, Hawaii,
[01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:10.830]  in an armored fortress with 5,000 security people and combat robots and drones,
[01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:15.830]  an underground base with escape jets, jump jets, helicopters and submarines.
[01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:21.830]  And you're like, why? Because that's all that's left is a war with the people.
[01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:24.830]  They got all the women, all the toys, all the power, all the control.
[01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:28.830]  And they're like Hitler, they're like, Hitler's like, Hitler was just fascinating.
[01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:31.830]  He'd stay up 24 hours in a row just through his binoculars watching a war.
[01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:36.830]  He would go out to the front on his train in the Russian front and just watch tanks and bombs all day long.
[01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:39.830]  He just loved it. It was so entertaining to watch people die.
[01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:45.830]  And that's them. They love seeing their shot kill us.
[01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:47.830]  They love seeing kids getting raped and murdered.
[01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:52.830]  They just sit, oh, it's so powerful. Oh, they're so amazing.
[01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:55.830]  They get to sit around and play with us like we're little toys.
[01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:59.830]  Little pawns in their sick game.
[01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:06.830]  I just can't wait till we're going to put them on the checkerboard or on the chessboard and say,
[01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:08.830]  oh, you're now a piece on the board.
[01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:12.830]  That's such a good ending of that amazing Sam Peckinpah movie, Cross of Iron.
[01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:17.830]  It's a composite of true stories and the collapse of the Eastern Front in World War II.
[01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:23.830]  And there's this Prussian aristocrat, minor royalty guy, who's always being mean to his troops.
[01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:26.830]  He's got the best troops out there. He never actually goes out to battle with them.
[01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:31.830]  But he's all, he's jealous of the real soldiers that have like four or five iron crosses and have survived
[01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:33.830]  and all this stuff on the Eastern Front.
[01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:37.830]  And at the end, the Russians are taking over and everything's collapsing.
[01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:41.830]  And he looks at him in his full battle uniform with a stupid Kurdish helmet on.
[01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:47.830]  And the guy, Steiner, that's the big war hero, hands him a grenade launcher and starts laughing at him.
[01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:54.830]  You're finally going to have to fight, you cowardly sack of garbage.
[01:40:55.830 --> 01:41:00.830]  And that's what I can't wait for, is all you globalists, you think you're safe in your rat holes.
[01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:02.830]  And I promise you, you're not safe.
[01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:08.830]  I promise you that the people that come to fix your toaster when this all goes down
[01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:13.830]  and to fix your leaky roof, wherever that is in the future, are going to slit your throats.
[01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:19.830]  You can bet you know it. You know those underground bases of their tombs.
[01:41:20.830 --> 01:41:23.830]  And I'm not calling for violence. I'm not pushing anything on these people.
[01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:26.830]  I'm just saying, you can see death written all over these guys.
[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:32.830]  Can run on for a long time. Run on for a long time.
[01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:37.830]  God's going to cut you down. Sooner or later, God's going to cut you down.
[01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:42.830]  In fact, I'm going to take calls until the last two minutes of this hour.
[01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:47.830]  I want to go out with Johnny Cash for that song.
[01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:50.830]  All right, I'm going to shut up now, take calls in order to receive.
[01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:52.830]  I apologize, I went on a long rant.
[01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:55.830]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois, laying out the plan on how to stop it.
[01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:56.830]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:59.830]  Ooh, Mr. Jones, I got goosebumps from that.
[01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:03.830]  I need you 2.0, unfiltered. I'm like fired up.
[01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:08.830]  The reason you're getting upset and drained is because you're giving your energy to everyone else who listens.
[01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:10.830]  So don't worry, we got your back.
[01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:15.830]  Now, I did want to talk about, you know, I was going to say Gerald Salonte's comments from last week,
[01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:19.830]  or this morning's show from American Journal, the caller Simon talking about bricks.
[01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:23.830]  But your rant, I need to talk about the next step more than anything.
[01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:26.830]  And I think for you, you've accomplished your mission.
[01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:28.830]  We are all aware in spreading the word.
[01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:31.830]  I think the next step is for you to go to BibleWars.com.
[01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:36.830]  You changed my life through spirituality, and I think that's the perfect step.
[01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:39.830]  We need pastors who are aggressive, who are fighting against the evil.
[01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:41.830]  And I'm not calling you a pastor or anything.
[01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:45.830]  I mean, if you keep going, I think you're going to be a saint in the history books.
[01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:46.830]  But I think you're right.
[01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:47.830]  We need God.
[01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:49.830]  God is the answer right now.
[01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.830]  Yeah, and you are the perfect person.
[01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:53.830]  You made perfect analogies.
[01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:59.830]  You reinstalled my faith in the Bible and the word of God, just from connecting it to modern day times.
[01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:04.830]  I don't know one person that does that now and the aggression that it deserves like you're giving.
[01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:05.830]  You're aggressive.
[01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:06.830]  Well, enough about me.
[01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:08.830]  But what was the analogy that touched your heart and your mind?
[01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:09.830]  What did I say?
[01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:15.830]  Months ago, you said something about when Roe v. Wade was overturned or before it was overturned.
[01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:20.830]  You said God lifted his protection in the 1970s when we passed Roe v. Wade.
[01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:26.830]  And I promise you, ever since it got overturned, I've been seeing the awakening at an exponential level.
[01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:27.830]  Like crazy.
[01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:29.830]  That's why I think BibleWars is the great next step.
[01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:30.830]  You say you're tired of BibleWars.
[01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:33.830]  That's why I forgive Trump for even the poison shot because he got lied to.
[01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:35.830]  He helped Roe v. Wade.
[01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:36.830]  He did that.
[01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:38.830]  And so that's why they hate him.
[01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:39.830]  He's a good man.
[01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:40.830]  Yep.
[01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:41.830]  And exactly.
[01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:45.830]  That line that you said, I don't know when, it has stuck with me nonstop.
[01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:48.830]  And I always ask my religious family, just connections.
[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:50.830]  Like, what do you think is going on now?
[01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:51.830]  Is that in Revelations?
[01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:52.830]  What passage does this mean?
[01:43:52.830 --> 01:43:54.830]  Oh, that's what happened with Job.
[01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:56.830]  I need to be grateful even though I'm sick.
[01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:57.830]  Stuff like that.
[01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:58.830]  I'm 27 years old.
[01:43:58.830 --> 01:44:01.830]  I was a super liberal three years ago, four years ago.
[01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:04.830]  And the spirituality aspect is what flipped me more than anything.
[01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:07.830]  So I just think that you, when you're tired of InfoWars,
[01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:09.830]  you're still going to get on politics that's in your blood,
[01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.830]  but going to BibleWars and connecting.
[01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:12.830]  No, I agree.
[01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:15.830]  Real quick, laying out the plan on how to stop it.
[01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:16.830]  How do we stop it?
[01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:17.830]  You're saying just get back to God.
[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:19.830]  Well, keep spreading the word.
[01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:21.830]  On our end, we need to spread the word.
[01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:25.830]  We need to make the bold predictions in 2020 that we made that now came true.
[01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:26.830]  Half the people woke up.
[01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:28.830]  We're going to keep doing that as listeners.
[01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:32.830]  For you, though, I think that you have accomplished your mission on InfoWars,
[01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:33.830]  and now we turn to the spirituality.
[01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:37.830]  Like your documentary that you did right now.
[01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:38.830]  But it was amazing.
[01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:39.830]  It changed lives.
[01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:41.830]  I get goosebumps every time you play that commercial.
[01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:43.830]  So I think that's like a great message.
[01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:44.830]  All right, brother.
[01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:45.830]  I appreciate you.
[01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:46.830]  Thank you.
[01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:47.830]  Great points.
[01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:48.830]  Greg in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:49.830]  Thank you.
[01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:50.830]  RFK Globalist turning things around.
[01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:51.830]  Can we turn it around?
[01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.830]  Alex, thank you so much.
[01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:56.830]  I'm so inspired by everything you've done.
[01:44:56.830 --> 01:45:02.830]  I had the privilege of being Ron Paul's MySpace moderator during the 2008 election.
[01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:11.830]  And I remember when he was going to go on your show and had all these people writing in on the MySpace account,
[01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:12.830]  which was the biggest one.
[01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:16.830]  It was trending way over Obama and all those people at the time.
[01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:22.830]  And they were trying to keep Ron Paul from going on the show.
[01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:25.830]  And I finally realized that they were all Hillary trolls and those kind of people.
[01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:30.830]  But I really became enlightened more so.
[01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:32.830]  I mean, I was already enlightened.
[01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:34.830]  Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten that job working for Ron Paul.
[01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:40.830]  But, man, since that time, I really learned you are right about so many things.
[01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:44.830]  And I believe we're winning right now.
[01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:46.830]  But the fight is far from over.
[01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:52.830]  And not holding back is the best thing we can do.
[01:45:52.830 --> 01:46:00.830]  You know, when we were being censored on social media for months and months and months during COVID lockdowns and all that,
[01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:05.830]  I was losing my mind because I felt like I was being stymied.
[01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:13.830]  But now that Elon Musk has opened up the truth and people are starting to see it, I think we're starting to win.
[01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:17.830]  And I owe it all to him.
[01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:21.830]  Yeah, your phone's breaking up, but I appreciate your call.
[01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:26.830]  And I'm not saying Elon Musk is perfect, but we see Politico, The New York Times.
[01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:32.830]  Musk claims he's against censorship, but he's limiting tweets to 600 reads a day.
[01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:37.830]  Well, that's because they've got AI bots scanning it, tracking it, and trying to jam the site.
[01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:42.830]  We put limits on our shopping cart where when we're getting a bunch of fake traffic,
[01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:45.830]  you got to go do all those little questionnaires so we know you're a real person.
[01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:47.830]  I'm sorry you got to do that, but that's the same thing.
[01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:49.830]  That's not censorship.
[01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:51.830]  That's a system to keep it up.
[01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:55.830]  Notice The New York Times didn't attack Musk, though, for not putting me back on, which is real censorship.
[01:46:55.830 --> 01:47:02.830]  They attacked because, oh, you're blocking people from seeing more than 600 tweets a day.
[01:47:02.830 --> 01:47:05.830]  Nobody's reading 600 tweets a day, maybe 1%.
[01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:07.830]  No, it's meant to block bots.
[01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:10.830]  So when Musk does something really bad, I'll say he's bad.
[01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:12.830]  I don't trust him, but this is not censorship.
[01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:14.830]  This is trying to block the censors.
[01:47:14.830 --> 01:47:17.830]  Let's take another phone call, a bunch of more phone calls.
[01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:18.830]  We're going right down the line.
[01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:21.830]  Brad, Robert, Ryan, Jake, Ann, Richard, Brad, Samantha.
[01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:23.830]  Brad in Seattle, you're on the air.
[01:47:23.830 --> 01:47:24.830]  Go ahead.
[01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:26.830]  The answer to tyranny.
[01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:27.830]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:32.830]  You often tell us that these so-called elites, through their shivel code,
[01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:36.830]  tell us what they're going to do to us before they do it.
[01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:43.830]  I think in these movies and such, they also embed the answer to defeating them,
[01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:52.830]  and that is the common denominator seems to be infiltration and going into the nucleus and destroying it.
[01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:56.830]  Well, that's right.
[01:47:56.830 --> 01:48:00.830]  In the original Handmaid's Tale, they claim conservatives are enslaving women.
[01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:03.830]  Everybody's sterilized, so the elite has to have the few women that can have children.
[01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:09.830]  Robert De Niro's the dictator, and he gets killed by the sex slave,
[01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:12.830]  and they're telling you right there, and I'm not calling for violence,
[01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:15.830]  but that's where the point-blank range stuff's going to start happening,
[01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:17.830]  is people that are up close to these globalists.
[01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:22.830]  Well, I think we're being called out now to do our part,
[01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:29.830]  and whether that be applying for jobs, getting into these companies, news,
[01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:36.830]  the tech industries, pharmacies, and our part, whether it be documentary,
[01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:39.830]  a few key strokes here and there.
[01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:43.830]  Well, I think wherever you live, whistleblowers are incredible.
[01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:46.830]  The system always liked them with Daniel Ellsberg, the rest of it.
[01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:51.830]  So I think wherever you are, you work, you do a good job, you see criminal activity, you expose it.
[01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:52.830]  So yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:54.830]  I think that's part of the paradox.
[01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:58.830]  That's why they gave poison shots to the military, is to get the good people out of the military
[01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.830]  so they could do whatever they wanted.
[01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.830]  It was a purge device.
[01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:05.830]  And so I don't want to advise someone who's in the military to be a guinea pig,
[01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:09.830]  but it's sad that the good people are getting out of the military.
[01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:19.830]  I'm talking about going further, doing our part, whether it be destroying these shops,
[01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:25.830]  a couple key strokes here, shavings of metal here, water there.
[01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:32.830]  To give you an example, a few years ago, in this Bezos and Branson little space race,
[01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:40.830]  here in Seattle, they dropped the Blue Origin engine.
[01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:51.830]  And with that little thing there, Branson won his trip to space before Bezos.
[01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:55.830]  You know, I'm certainly not a general, and I'm not here telling people what they should do sabotage-wise,
[01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:57.830]  and I appreciate your call.
[01:49:57.830 --> 01:50:01.830]  I would not call for anybody to sabotage anything.
[01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:05.830]  But I mean, again, that's what the left does.
[01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:10.830]  They call a general, burn stuff down, and they go burn down some building full of orphans or something.
[01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:14.830]  It's idiotic.
[01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:15.830]  I'm not saying you're an idiot.
[01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:16.830]  I'm not saying you said that.
[01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:21.830]  I'm just saying some people could interpret what you said as just randomly going around and like,
[01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:28.830]  I don't know the story of somebody you're saying sabotaged Bezos' spacecraft.
[01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:30.830]  Well, why would we do that?
[01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:32.830]  Is that spacecraft hurting anybody?
[01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:37.830]  Just go to city councils and critical race theory and expose it.
[01:50:37.830 --> 01:50:40.830]  And then notice the feds wanted that shut down because it beat it.
[01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:43.830]  You don't have to kill anybody to beat this right now.
[01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:51.830]  We can beat it by standing up and saying no, and by also removing ourselves from their grasp, protecting our children.
[01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:54.830]  Everybody just is programmed by Hollywood.
[01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:57.830]  They're like Batman, bust through the window, and he meets the Joker.
[01:50:57.830 --> 01:51:00.830]  The Joker is the bureaucracy.
[01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:01.830]  It's the system.
[01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:03.830]  You have to realize the Joker is the mayor.
[01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:05.830]  The Joker is the boss.
[01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:09.830]  They sell the Joker like he's this underling, and he's this rebel, and he's this outside guy.
[01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:12.830]  No, George Soros is the Joker.
[01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.830]  David Rockefeller is the Joker.
[01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:15.830]  Obama is the Joker.
[01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:16.830]  Biden is the Joker.
[01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:21.830]  They're criminals in charge, raping us, turning us against each other.
[01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:25.830]  There's nothing cool about defunding the police.
[01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:27.830]  Yeah, we reform them.
[01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:28.830]  We make sure they're doing their job.
[01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:31.830]  But the police are just a mode.
[01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:33.830]  It's who controls them that's the issue.
[01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:36.830]  And the Joker right now is in control of the police in most cities.
[01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:40.830]  In the cities where the Joker is not in control, almost no crime.
[01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:41.830]  People are safe.
[01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:42.830]  Everything's good.
[01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:43.830]  Citizens are left alone.
[01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.830]  The sheriff says, hey, police, own guns, citizens, defend yourselves.
[01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:47.830]  They have good grand juries.
[01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:48.830]  They don't indict a citizen.
[01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:51.830]  When a criminal is breaking into their house, a citizen kills them.
[01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:54.830]  The criminals learn to go to the next town real quick.
[01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:58.830]  And most of our country still has good police chiefs and sheriffs, but it's medium and small towns.
[01:51:58.830 --> 01:52:01.830]  Almost every city is globally controlled.
[01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:05.830]  People say, well, then why are you living in a big city?
[01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:06.830]  It's where my family's from.
[01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:07.830]  It's where I put down roots.
[01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:11.830]  I don't have money to build a new infrastructure and move out of here at this point.
[01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:13.830]  But, yes, I know I've got to get out of here.
[01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:16.830]  Not that I don't like Austin and like parts of it.
[01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:23.830]  It's just that it's been captured by the enemy and it's hard to run an operation in the middle of an enemy camp.
[01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:25.830]  Does it mean the average cop's my enemy?
[01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:27.830]  No, but the city council is globalist.
[01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:28.830]  The judges are globalist.
[01:52:28.830 --> 01:52:32.830]  They put police officers in jail where a guy pulls a gun on them and a cop shoots them.
[01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:34.830]  The cop goes to jail.
[01:52:34.830 --> 01:52:36.830]  I mean, it's not safe for anybody.
[01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:38.830]  It's why half the cops resigned.
[01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:40.830]  It's not because they're cowards.
[01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:43.830]  You can't work under people that are out to get you.
[01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:44.830]  Communist.
[01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:50.830]  The district attorney in Austin literally calls his employees comrades and is a Marxist Leninist.
[01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:56.830]  You imagine risking your life every day, going to domestic violence stuff and all this crap,
[01:52:56.830 --> 01:53:01.830]  and then you've got a DA that's going to indict you if you defend yourself?
[01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:02.830]  It's just a disaster.
[01:53:02.830 --> 01:53:03.830]  It's a total disaster.
[01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:07.830]  And I'm just like the Austin cops that resigned.
[01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:09.830]  I'm just like, I have to leave this jurisdiction.
[01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:10.830]  I cannot be under this.
[01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:12.830]  I'm an idiot if I do.
[01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:13.830]  All right, let's go to another caller.
[01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:14.830]  Jake in FEMA Region 6.
[01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:17.830]  I'm in FEMA Region 6 on replacement migration.
[01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:20.830]  Now, the Southern Property Law Center and ADL say we can't say that,
[01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:22.830]  even though it's an official U.N. plan on their website.
[01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:24.830]  So you do what the ADL says now.
[01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:26.830]  Shut your mouth, Jake.
[01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:28.830]  Yes, sir, that's exactly right.
[01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:30.830]  Pleasure speaking with you, Mr. Jones.
[01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:36.830]  I'm looking at these riots happening in Europe,
[01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:41.830]  and I can't help but think that all those migrants are U.N. shock troops being sent in.
[01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:43.830]  Well, the U.N. organized them.
[01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:44.830]  The U.N. brought them in.
[01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:48.830]  The U.N. brainwashed them to hate Europe and promised them all these.
[01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:49.830]  I mean, they literally, the U.N.
[01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:50.830]  This isn't mainstream news.
[01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:51.830]  What the e-mail was saying is true.
[01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:54.830]  Germany runs ads in the Middle East and Africa saying,
[01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:58.830]  come to Germany and get a 14-year-old girl.
[01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:00.830]  Come get a hot young woman.
[01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.830]  Come get everything free.
[01:54:02.830 --> 01:54:05.830]  And then they show up and demand, where's my free woman?
[01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:07.830]  Where's my free lifestyle?
[01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:13.830]  And then you've got a bunch of liberal police that, oh, they rammed a truck into our base.
[01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:15.830]  There's like 50 cops inside.
[01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:18.830]  The cops retreat and let the Islamists have the guns.
[01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:22.830]  One cop with a full auto against unarmed people could have stopped all them,
[01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:27.830]  but they all didn't want to be filling out paperwork of why they killed a bunch of people
[01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:28.830]  and invading the police station.
[01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:33.830]  They're burning the police station with buses and Lamborghinis.
[01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:35.830]  They literally, they slammed into it.
[01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:41.830]  And then the cops run because they're afraid to go to jail because they know.
[01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:44.830]  It's the same Soros policy there.
[01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:48.830]  So why are you, it's the white flag.
[01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:50.830]  Go ahead.
[01:54:50.830 --> 01:54:53.830]  We're about to see, I'm hoping not,
[01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:57.830]  but I'm scared that we're about to see that exact sort of thing here.
[01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:01.830]  What if these hundreds of thousands of migrants that have come into our country
[01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:05.830]  are now being, having the same program done to them,
[01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:07.830]  saying like we're going to start riots here in America.
[01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:11.830]  Yeah, it's not as bad as Europe where 90% are military.
[01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:12.830]  It's like half here.
[01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:15.830]  But yes, it's the exact same thing, the exact same playbook.
[01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:18.830]  Well, we still need, we need a crackdown.
[01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:20.830]  I think this migrant, this migrant.
[01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:22.830]  Well, let's stop calling them migrants.
[01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:24.830]  They're legal aliens shipped in by the UN.
[01:55:24.830 --> 01:55:25.830]  They're invaders.
[01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:26.830]  Exactly.
[01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:30.830]  These invaders that we're seeing go and ruin Europe.
[01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:32.830]  I hope that we don't see here.
[01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:37.830]  And I've got friends in the police force, sheriff's department, state troopers
[01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:41.830]  that are giving me stories of seeing guys come over here, commit murders,
[01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:44.830]  and then we don't see them ever again.
[01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:48.830]  And I'm just worried that we're going to hopefully not get an uprising
[01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:53.830]  or at least they're all going to get it together with these leftist organizations
[01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:55.830]  that cause riots all over our streets.
[01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:57.830]  Well, it's now spread to a hundred French cities
[01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:59.830]  and hundreds of other cities around Europe.
[01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:01.830]  And I have the articles right here where they're like
[01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:05.830]  hundreds of nationalists march to defend their town.
[01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:07.830]  French police were diverted to arrest them.
[01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:10.830]  And so whether it's Dutch farmers losing their farm,
[01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.830]  they attack them, they take them to jail.
[01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:14.830]  French defending themselves, they take them to jail.
[01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:17.830]  Soccer team coaches, you know, say this is wrong, they go to jail.
[01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:22.830]  The French government is a bunch of criminals that are running this attack.
[01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:25.830]  Well, you're exactly right, Mr. Jones, as you always have been.
[01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:27.830]  It's a pleasure speaking with you. God bless.
[01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:30.830]  I'm not always right. This is just the enemy's plans out in the open.
[01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:33.830]  We're going to start the next hour at six after we'll play Johnny Cash
[01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:35.830]  since we forgot to do it here.
[01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:38.830]  And we'll go back to your phone calls.
[01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:43.830]  We'll go to Ann, Richard, Brad, Samantha, Aaron, Dino, Leo, Ian, Ryan.
[01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:45.830]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:47.830]  I got to four or five, six calls there. I did okay.
[01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:50.830]  But I'm really coming back on the other side of this break.
[01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:52.830]  I want to wrap your calls separately.
[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:54.830]  I'm not fun about George Soros. I'm fun about you.
[01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:56.830]  Plus, we've got products that are absolutely amazing.
[01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:57.830]  It will do incredible things.
[01:56:57.830 --> 01:57:00.830]  Nitric Boost is a bunch of known compounds that medical doctors
[01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:02.830]  don't know about how great it is, like Dr. Mikovits.
[01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:04.830]  It just flushes out your blood, cleans out everything.
[01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:06.830]  It's like Ivermectin 2.0.

[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.880]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.880]  And the answer is different herbal formulas, different compounds are better for different
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:11.880]  people.

[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:16.880]  Another person likes that coffee.
[01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:17.880]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:18.880]  They're all very diverse.
[01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:23.880]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller that's been sold for many years

[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:56.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:13.880]  Hi, we're back live.
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:14.880]  Hour number three.
[02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.880]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.880]  I'm going to host a little bit in the fourth hour.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:21.880]  We've got Gerald Slunzie taking over, but I've got to get to all these clips on the news.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:23.880]  But I'm taking your calls right now.
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:24.880]  Let's go to Anne in New Mexico.
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:25.880]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:26.880]  You're on the air.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:29.880]  Hi, I'm glad to be here and thank you for taking my call.
[02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:33.880]  I wanted to tell you I've only had three aha moments in my life.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:42.880]  The first aha moment was when I discovered your Bohemian Grove, what you did there.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.880]  And you were on Art Bell and we've been listening to you ever since.
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:52.880]  Then we went all organic and we dropped off the meats and we dropped off all these things.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:55.880]  And all of a sudden we felt a very good clarity.
[02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.880]  My husband and I felt very clear.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.880]  All of a sudden it was like, gee, we just feel healthier.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:11.880]  And then the last aha moment was it's my birthday and my husband got me a nitric boost and your ultimate krill oil.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:13.880]  And I thought, well, this will be fun.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.880]  We'll put this into our diet and our regimen.
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:19.880]  And I'll be darned if I don't feel absolutely amazing.
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:24.880]  Your nitric boost and that ultimate krill oil, holy cow.
[02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:30.880]  I'm a manager for a large firm and I do a lot of work with people and I care about them.
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:40.880]  And all of a sudden here I am feeling more balanced and more able to direct people and continue my good work.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.880]  And it's all because of this and you and you and I love your face.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.880]  And just thank you so much.
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.880]  The nitric boost, the ultimate krill oil for women.
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:55.880]  If you want to do this, go do this.
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:56.880]  Just take it.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:01:57.880]  You'll feel better.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:58.880]  Trust me.
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:05.880]  It is very, very good and it will enlighten you and you will just feel ready to go to work.
[02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:07.880]  And it's better than coffee.
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:09.880]  It's better than everything.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:11.880]  I just want to tell you thank you.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.880]  And the nitric boost and ultimate krill oil.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.880]  And we're going to go up and order some more today off your store.
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:24.880]  And then we're going to go get the multivitamin too because I feel so good and I just want to say thank you.
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:29.880]  And thank you for all your hard work and you're super and we love you.
[02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:31.880]  Well, Ann, I love you too and I appreciate you.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:37.880]  Yeah, the krill oil, the fish oil is great too, but this is high grade krill oil, the best they make.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:40.880]  And it just does wild things to the brain.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:41.880]  It's brain food.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  It's next level.
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:43.880]  But I'll be honest with listeners.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:50.880]  You drink or you eat krill oil or fish oil that doesn't taste fishy with fish burps, it means they've boiled it.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:51.880]  They've homogenized it.
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.880]  It isn't good.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:56.880]  This has terrible fish burps, especially the krill oil because it's so strong.
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.880]  So I take it when I go to sleep at night, drink a lot of water.
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.880]  It's usually not bad.
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:02.880]  Sometimes at 2 a.m. I wake up and burp and I'm like I don't like the fish taste.
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:08.880]  But look, it's going to have the side effect of that because it's so strong.
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.880]  There's no krill parts.
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:11.880]  There's no krill guts in this.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.880]  This is purified but not homogenized.
[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:15.880]  It comes out bright red.
[02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:20.880]  It is the essence of the krill, the first level, the building blocks in the ocean.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.880]  And there's just the studies are out there on krill oil.
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:24.880]  It is over the top.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:27.880]  We call it ultimate krill oil because it's the highest grade.
[02:03:27.880 --> 02:03:32.880]  We can get low grade krill oil that's still really good for you for a fraction of the cost.
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:35.880]  I mean like 10% of what we pay for this.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:40.880]  But we put out the highest grade krill oil there is because it does amazing things.
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:44.880]  But I got to tell you, I grimace when I remember to take it at night.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:45.880]  I have great dreams.
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:47.880]  It makes me feel great, great for your skin.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:50.880]  But I just do not like fish burps.
[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:51.880]  Now you can also take it with food.
[02:03:51.880 --> 02:03:52.880]  It's not as bad.
[02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:53.880]  But it doesn't work as well.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:58.880]  If you take it on more of an empty stomach, it's really psychotropic, I mean for me.
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.880]  It does really wild things to the brain.
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.880]  But it's got the issue with the fish burps.
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:05.880]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:06.880]  I appreciate your support.
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.880]  And again, folks, I'm not going to lie to you.
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:14.880]  The fish oils, highest grade fish oil you can get, it's not been pasteurized.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.880]  And it's not been boiled.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:20.880]  So you can get fish oil all day that says on it no fish taste, no fish burps.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.880]  It's because it's dead, folks.
[02:04:22.880 --> 02:04:23.880]  It's dead.
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.880]  So if you want the benefits, you got to deal with it.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:27.880]  And some people don't mind it.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:29.880]  I cannot stand it.
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:32.880]  That's why, I'll be honest, I don't take it as much as I should.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:33.880]  I got to be a man.
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.880]  I got to take it, man.
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:37.880]  I'm just such a wimp when it comes to weird stuff like that.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:39.880]  Like, okay, maybe I get one fish burp.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:42.880]  I'm being honest to you.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.880]  Because that's what I do.
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:45.880]  All right.
[02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:46.880]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:47.880]  Enough about fish burps.
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:48.880]  Samantha, you're up next.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.880]  We'll be right back.

[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:25.040]  Transcribed by https://otter.ai
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:57.040]  So, the UN, the Davos Group, they all a decade ago,
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:00.040]  the British government called for climate lockdowns, climate rations.
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:04.040]  If you're a new listener, just write down climate lockdowns, climate rations.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:07.040]  And they'll go to the London Guardian, or anywhere.
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.040]  And you're going to see them there promoting this.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:15.040]  And then now they say we're cutting off your pipelines, we're cutting off your energy,
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:20.040]  we're going to make it where you can't have a car, we're going to have a climate lockdown.
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:24.040]  They ran promos during the COVID lockdown saying,
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:27.040]  isn't this great, we need permanent lockdowns for the climate.
[02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.040]  They ran promos.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:32.040]  But they have an article,
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:37.040]  how climate lockdowns became the new battleground for conspiracy driven protest movement.
[02:08:38.040 --> 02:08:41.040]  Just like they say, there's no solar engineering,
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:44.040]  but now the White House is calling for it.
[02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.040]  So then it goes on.
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:49.040]  Social credit score hits the UK.
[02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:51.040]  Bank accounts of Brexit leader Nigel Farage shut down.
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:54.040]  Says many fleeing the country.
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:57.040]  As other conservatives have all banking taken away.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.040]  This is their control.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.040]  Look at this article.
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:06.040]  By 2030, you will not eat meat and you will be allowed only three items of new clothing a year,
[02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:08.040]  says UN adopted report.
[02:09:09.040 --> 02:09:10.040]  I covered this in the first hour.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:20.040]  They say we're going to cut off your consumption of food, construction, clothing, vehicles, aviation, electronics.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:24.040]  That's the future of urban consumption adopted by the UN.
[02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.040]  Netherlands, anti-nitrogen cuts.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:32.040]  Anti-government lies.
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:37.040]  Police have started manhandling the peaceful protesters using the exact same script as they did with COVID lockdowns.
[02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:38.040]  This is why they need the numbers.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:41.040]  And it goes on where they're shutting down the farms in the Netherlands.
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:49.040]  Now, here is a scientist and researcher, co-founder of Greenpeace, Dr. Patrick Moore,
[02:09:49.040 --> 02:09:50.040]  who really cares about the environment.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.040]  And we are doing bad stuff to the environment.
[02:09:52.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  We should stop.
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:55.040]  But none of the global agenda has anything to do with that.
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:58.040]  The GMO, the genetic engineering, the toxic waste dumping,
[02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:03.040]  the chemicals that are causing sterilization of amphibians and fish and us.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:05.040]  Yeah, there's plenty of problems.
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:08.040]  They make it about carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:11.040]  And now nitrogen is the majority of the atmosphere.
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:15.040]  Greenpeace co-founder, Dr. Patrick Moore, explains how unelected globalists,
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.040]  including Klaus Schwab of the United Nations,
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:21.040]  are using the climate scam as an excuse to cut off fossil fuels and nitrogen fertilizer
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:24.040]  in order to deliberately depopulate the earth.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.040]  These powerful elites, like Schwab and Down, they want control of the world.
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:30.040]  They want control of everybody.
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:33.040]  Now, what do they want?
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:34.040]  They want fewer people.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:39.040]  By the way, I don't usually have time to watch Joe Rogan's three-hour podcast.
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.040]  I watched a bunch of it yesterday.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:42.040]  Ice Cube is Alex Jones.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:43.040]  3.0.
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:45.040]  Super eloquent.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:50.040]  Just laying out the whole New World Order plan to depopulate its controls,
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:54.040]  cut everything off, bring in the New World Order, poison us, not let us know what hit us.
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.040]  He says, they're not going to censor me.
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:58.040]  I'm going on all the podcasts, even the ones I'm not supposed to go on.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.040]  Well, we're ready for you right here.
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.040]  So, I'm telling you, man, the founder of Greenpeace says it's a plan to kill you.
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.040]  Robert F. Kennedy says it's a plan to kill you.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.040]  A plan to take control of you.
[02:11:14.040 --> 02:11:15.040]  Ice Cube was talking about it.
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:21.040]  So, humanity is rising.
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:24.040]  As negative as I get, it's so you realize how bad it is.
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:30.040]  It's like somebody with liver failure and a good buddy died from drinking.
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:33.040]  He was 33 when he died.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.040]  I grew up with my best friend.
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:37.040]  He was drinking giant bottles of vodka every day.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.040]  And he went in the hospital.
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:39.040]  They said, your liver's failing.
[02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:40.040]  It's fatty.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.040]  If you keep drinking, you'll be dead.
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.040]  And he went and got more alcohol and drank and was dead three months later of organ failure.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:48.040]  And it's the same thing.
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  It's like, if we keep doing this, we're dead.
[02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:54.040]  It has to stop now.
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:56.040]  It has to end now.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.040]  We've got to say no now.
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:00.040]  There's no more, oh, our children and grandchildren will be enslaved.
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:02.040]  We're going to be enslaved.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.040]  We are being enslaved.
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:07.040]  Don't let the left intimidate you.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.040]  Don't let them dictate they're the good guys.
[02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:10.040]  Don't let them be the boss over you.
[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:11.040]  Don't let them bully you.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:14.040]  And then you have your own truthful narrative that you promote and you live by.
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.040]  And we embrace everybody.
[02:12:16.040 --> 02:12:18.040]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:21.040]  As long as they're pro-human and pro-freedom.
[02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:24.040]  People talk about, oh, Alex Jones has transgender Blair White on.
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.040]  Alex Jones is nice to Blair White.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:31.040]  I interviewed Blair White when Blair White was first going public like eight, nine years ago.
[02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:37.040]  And I said, if you're an adult and you want to live as another sex, you're not hurting somebody.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:38.040]  That's your issue.
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:39.040]  I'm not judging you.
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:41.040]  I think it's a destructive overall system.
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.040]  But don't target children and don't try to sterilize kids.
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.040]  Well, Blair White's against all that and goes around on all these big shows saying, leave the kids alone.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:52.040]  So Blair White's not our enemy.
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:55.040]  I don't sit up here on some high horse.
[02:12:56.040 --> 02:12:59.040]  And say whatever happened to Blair White growing up in California.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.040]  And the rest of it and whatever went on, that that person's a bad person.
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:04.040]  They're not hurting anybody.
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:09.040]  But the left wants to say we're hypocrites.
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:13.040]  I've never been against, quote, gay people, to use the term they want me to use.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:15.040]  But I don't like them trying to tell me to use that term.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:17.040]  It's heterosexual, it's homosexual.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:19.040]  I'm not going to use the terms you tell me anymore.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:22.040]  I don't hate you because of what you do in your bedroom.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.040]  But I do hate you trying to run my life and targeting children.
[02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:36.040]  So if the, quote, gay community wants to adopt LGBT-S, then I'm your enemy.
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:37.040]  I'm going to play this clip and go to your calls.
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:44.040]  But let me tell you, my mother's father had a whole lung full of fluid, congestive heart failure.
[02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.040]  He was in the hospital, passing out, going into a coma.
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.040]  We got on an airplane, we got there.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:55.040]  By the time we got there, they got him on medication and stuff,
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.040]  and he literally urinated out like five gallons of fluid,
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:00.040]  and was back up, walking around the hospital, doing great.
[02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:02.040]  The guy's like an ox.
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:06.040]  But I was in Omaha for four days during the pride parades.
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:11.040]  And I'm going to send this photo to a producer.
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:12.040]  I'll send it to you during the break.
[02:14:13.040 --> 02:14:14.040]  We'll add it in post, right, you know, later.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:15.040]  Give me a note, guys.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:17.040]  Add this in post for TV viewers later.
[02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.040]  We'll update it so you can see what I'm talking about.
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:26.040]  But they had like an LGBT party in the hotel Saturday, the day before we flew back yesterday.
[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:31.040]  And I walked in after being downstairs eating breakfast,
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.040]  and I was going to go shoot a video with Rob Do.
[02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:38.040]  And this guy gets on the elevator, and I could tell he's shaking.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:39.040]  I go, well, let me look at this guy.
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:43.040]  And the hotel was only eight stories tall, so I had like 20 seconds, 30 seconds.
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:47.040]  He's got a shirt that's got Satan on it in front of a rainbow.
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:51.040]  Saying pride month, but it spells demon in the middle.
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:53.040]  Pride month spells demon.
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.040]  And he's looking at me, shaking.
[02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:57.040]  And my wife's standing right beside him.
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:58.040]  I'm in front of him.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:01.040]  And she said he was just typing randomly nothing.
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:04.040]  Shaking, because I'm on the elevator.
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.040]  I don't hate that guy because he likes men.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.040]  I don't like him because he's a nut who thinks I'm out to get him,
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:14.040]  who then is wearing a shirt with a demon on it.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.040]  He can say, well, I do that to upset Christians.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.040]  No, dude.
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:19.040]  You do it because that's the agenda.
[02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.040]  And Target, it's a Target shirt.
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:22.040]  I told you.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:25.040]  Target sells shirts that say that's the shirt.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.040]  Let me show you right now.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.040]  It's in my camera roll.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:33.040]  So, I'll find it during the break.
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:43.040]  Yeah, so my point is, folks, these people are everywhere.
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:45.040]  And they're dangerous.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:51.040]  And we need to see the gays against groomers come out more and say you don't support.
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.040]  It's just like when I saw KKK marching 30 years ago and saying horrible things in black communities.
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:59.040]  I went out and protested and I said it's wrong to come march through a black community
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:01.040]  and tell them they're bad people and tell them they're scum and tell them they're bad.
[02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:05.040]  And you have your right to march, but I have my right to come out and say you're wrong.
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:10.040]  And it wasn't about patronizing or I'm an ally of the black people or I'm their white savior.
[02:16:10.040 --> 02:16:13.040]  It was like these white people do not speak for me.
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:19.040]  Well, I want black people to tell the racist black hordes because compared to the white supremacist,
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.040]  these are giant groups compared to that.
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:22.040]  Stop it.
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.040]  Stop mugging us.
[02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:24.040]  Stop killing us.
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:25.040]  Stop attacking us.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:30.040]  Stop saying we're bad because what color we are because I'm smart enough to not blame black people in general.
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:36.040]  But there's a lot of white people that are as dumb as the dumbest black people that are getting really pissed off.
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:39.040]  And getting manipulated.
[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:40.040]  And getting manipulated.
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:46.040]  And I don't want some senseless black on white, white on black war that kills a bunch of innocent people.
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:48.040]  Come on, man.
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:55.040]  We're smart enough to quote Joe Biden and just not do this.
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.040]  All right.
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.040]  I said I'd go to your calls and I will go to your calls.
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:01.040]  Great job of the proof on that shirt.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.040]  It's a Target shirt.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:07.040]  But I mean, you know, why would that guy be shaking in anger about me?
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:08.040]  He doesn't even know who I am.
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:10.040]  He doesn't even know what I stand for.
[02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:12.040]  Just leave kids alone, man.
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.040]  It's like the coming next segment with the wall.
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:23.040]  We don't need no education, no dark sarcasm in the classroom.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:26.040]  Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone.
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:29.040]  All about.
[02:17:29.040 --> 02:17:30.040]  There are a lot of great teachers.
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:33.040]  There's also weirdos that want to go mess with kids that are teachers.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:34.040]  And that song.
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:38.040]  Is about leave the kids alone, man.
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:39.040]  Leave them alone.
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.040]  Leave them alone.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:44.040]  That's the only fetish you got left.
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:48.040]  Well, it sounds like the thing you're into is not that good.
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:49.040]  Let me tell you something.
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.040]  I never get sick of sex with my wife.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:56.040]  I never get sick of eating a T-bone steak.
[02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:00.040]  I never get sick of hiking up a hillside looking at the sunset.
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:04.040]  I never get sick of taking a swim in the pool.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.040]  I never get sick of getting on my knees and praying to God.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:10.040]  You guys are not fulfilled because you're not with the program.
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:13.040]  And I'm sorry.
[02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:16.040]  That's why the gay guys run from man to man to man to man.
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:21.040]  Because you're not going to find love and you're not going to find a future with a man.
[02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.040]  You may find gratification and pleasure in one moment.
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:29.040]  But you're not going to find what there is with a man and a woman.
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:31.040]  Because look at all the other animals.
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:32.040]  That's what it is.
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:33.040]  A male and a female.
[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:35.040]  That's what we're designed to do.
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:37.040]  So nobody's trying to outlaw what you did.
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.040]  You're trying to outlaw us.
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.040]  And it's not going to work.
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:47.040]  My sex gets better, not worse.
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:49.040]  I don't need 50 partners.
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:52.040]  It gets better, not worse.
[02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:53.040]  I'm winning.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.040]  I'm succeeding.
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.040]  I don't mean that to rub it in your face.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.040]  You work for a system that wants to outlaw using the word mother and father.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:03.040]  You're attacking us by your silence.
[02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:05.040]  You're letting the system do this.
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:12.040]  You're corporately funded by the most greedy, evil corporations in the world that now want to cut off the nitrogen.
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:16.040]  Nitrogen is more important than oxygen.
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:23.040]  Without it, every plant on earth dies.
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:27.040]  It is life on this planet.
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:29.040]  Even more than H2O.
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:30.040]  Even more than oxygen.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]  Even more than carbon dioxide.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:38.040]  But because you're so ignorant, you're now going along with psychotic banks that are claiming jurisdiction over nitrogen
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:43.040]  because it gives them jurisdiction over everything with their AI systems.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.040]  So let's grow up here and admit what's going on.
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:51.040]  Shutting down farmers all over the world is going to starve billions to death.
[02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.040]  And anybody that supports that's a mass murder and I'll fight you to the death.
[02:19:56.040 --> 02:20:00.040]  Here is the report from the founder of Greenpeace.
[02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:02.040]  We'll go to your phone calls.
[02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:10.040]  It took 10 doubles only to go from 5 million people to 8 billion people in 7,000 years.
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:14.040]  That to me, I sit there and I say the following.
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:16.040]  I say Al Gore's full of shit.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.040]  I say AOC is definitely full of shit.
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:21.040]  The end of the world is in 12 years full of shit.
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:23.040]  But guess what?
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:26.040]  It is happening eventually if we don't do something about it.
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:27.040]  The end of the world?
[02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:28.040]  Not the end of the world.
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:29.040]  Or the end of human population growth?
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:32.040]  The end of the capacity.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:34.040]  What our capacity will be.
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:36.040]  So then we can think like Dr. Evil.
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:42.040]  I can tell you one thing that explains why there went from 4 billion to 8 billion for example.
[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:43.040]  Why?
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:44.040]  It's called the Haber-Bosch process.
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:47.040]  It won two Nobel Prizes in the early 1900s.
[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:55.040]  It was a formula, a technological process involving very high heat and very high pressure.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:21:04.040]  An extremely complicated process which was able to combine nitrogen from the atmosphere with natural gas to make ammonia.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:11.040]  That ammonia is the basis of all the nitrogen fertilizer being used in the world's agriculture today.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:15.040]  It results in doubling of crop production.
[02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:21.040]  And that is why we see this news today about Sri Lanka banning nitrogen fertilizer
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:26.040]  and Netherlands now basically banning much of the nitrogen fertilizer.
[02:21:27.040 --> 02:21:32.040]  And this is the biggest threat we have right now to an immediate starvation situation in the world.
[02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:33.040]  Food shortage.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:34.040]  You hear it said.
[02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:35.040]  It's where I'm going.
[02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:36.040]  The odd time.
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:37.040]  Yeah.
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:40.040]  But the reason it's self-inflicted, this food shortage.
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:45.040]  Nitrogen, the air has 70% of the air is nitrogen.
[02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:49.040]  We could take nitrogen out of the air for the next million years and make fertilizer
[02:21:49.040 --> 02:21:52.040]  because it all goes back into the air again eventually.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:54.040]  Same with the carbon dioxide.
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:58.040]  If we double two more times, we got 32 billion people here.
[02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:01.040]  We can't have 32 billion people in the world.
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:04.040]  In other words, we won't double to 32.
[02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:06.040]  If we can't have it, we won't go there.
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:07.040]  We can't get there.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:08.040]  Okay, so let's speculate.
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:09.040]  Tell me what you mean by that.
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:12.040]  What I mean is today people are getting wealthier.
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:19.040]  The number of people living in poverty as a percentage of the population is much smaller now than it was 20, 30, 50 years ago.
[02:22:20.040 --> 02:22:26.040]  When we reach a position where more and more people are going into poverty and starving to death,
[02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:28.040]  we will know we're coming close to that limit.
[02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:33.040]  How else are you going to find out unless you artificially reduce the population
[02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:38.040]  by cutting off the fossil fuels and by cutting off the nitrogen fertilizer?
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.040]  That's what the real problem is today.
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.040]  I'm saying this is a self-inflicted wound that we are dealing with right now.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:53.040]  And it's a real problem because I can see this, that these powerful elites like Schwab and on down,
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:56.040]  they want control of the world.
[02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:58.040]  They want control of everybody.
[02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:59.040]  Now, what do they want?
[02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:01.040]  They want fewer people.
[02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:03.040]  They think it's already too many, I think.
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:06.040]  That's what they've been saying in the United Nations for a long time.
[02:23:06.040 --> 02:23:10.040]  But the facts don't bear that out because less and less people are living in poverty
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:12.040]  and our knowledge of agriculture is growing.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:14.040]  Our knowledge of genetics is growing.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:17.040]  And we're able to grow way more food now than we were then.
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:20.040]  And food is the basis of how many people can.
[02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:24.040]  So that's Dr. Patrick Moore, the founder of the modern environmental movement,
[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:27.040]  saying they want to control you, enslave you, and kill you.
[02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:29.040]  And I love Patrick Ben David.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.040]  He had me on.
[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:31.040]  He let me talk for three hours.
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:32.040]  Didn't interrupt me.
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:33.040]  He's a smart guy.
[02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.040]  But he's buying into their lies.
[02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:38.040]  Everything will stabilize at $9 billion.
[02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:40.040]  All the actuaries show that.
[02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:42.040]  In fact, because of COVID, probably $8.5 billion.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:44.040]  We're at $8 billion right now.
[02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:49.040]  And then we've only got 1.5 replacement rate globally in the industrialized world.
[02:23:49.040 --> 02:23:53.040]  And it's like 3% in the third world.
[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:57.040]  And once people become middle class, they automatically only have two kids.
[02:23:57.040 --> 02:23:59.040]  Okay?
[02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:02.040]  So it stabilizes at $9 billion.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.040]  And then there's a population crash that Elon Musk has talked about,
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:08.040]  down to about $4 billion in the next 60 years.
[02:24:08.040 --> 02:24:11.040]  And we probably won't be able to sustain that, even with robots and things.
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  We may go back to the new dark age.
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:16.040]  It's very hard to get a civilization going like this.
[02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:18.040]  And if you don't have fossil fuels, you can't do it.
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:23.040]  So the globalists are strategically – he's sort of founder of the environmental movement.
[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:26.040]  This guy's the founder of the environmental movement.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:29.040]  It's not just R.O.K. Jr. saying it's a tyranny to take over.
[02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.040]  I've got his article right here.
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.040]  It came out again in a new video yesterday.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.040]  It's Dr. Patrick Moore, the oldest living king daddy of this,
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.040]  telling you exactly what I'm telling you.
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:48.040]  We have 5,000 years of coal at least discovered totally clean.
[02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:52.040]  We have – you heard him – 1,000, a million years.
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:54.040]  The atmosphere is nitrogen.
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:57.040]  We have unlimited because of that process.
[02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:00.040]  And BlackRock owns most of the fertilizer makers.
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:02.040]  They're just not producing right now.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.040]  You see food prices going up.
[02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:05.040]  You see starvation going up.
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:06.040]  That's why I said I'll eat my neighbors.
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:09.040]  They were cutting fertilizer three years ago, and I said that.
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:12.040]  And I was trying to say, like, to you liberals,
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:15.040]  you don't know how to shoot somebody at 1,000 yards.
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:16.040]  I do.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:18.040]  You don't know how to break somebody's neck.
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.040]  I do.
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:20.040]  I mean, sorry.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:21.040]  I'm not trying to act tough or anything.
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:22.040]  It's so easy.
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:23.040]  The point is you're not a killer.
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:24.040]  You're not a man.
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.040]  You were domesticated.
[02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.040]  You're a joke.
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:32.040]  And you think in this future world that you're creating
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:34.040]  that you're, like, going to be in charge of it.
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:36.040]  You're crazy.
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:37.040]  The globalists aren't liberal folks.
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:39.040]  They're satanic.
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:41.040]  And they have this weird social Darwinistic thing
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:43.040]  where they want to see this disaster happen,
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:46.040]  and they know full well I'm going to end up on top,
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.040]  and people like me aren't.
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:51.040]  And I'm just nicely here telling you you're about to be destroyed.
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:55.040]  But there's a good chance with nuclear weapons
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:56.040]  and the reactors and the rest of it,
[02:25:56.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  none of us are going to make it out of this.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:00.040]  We have to stop this.
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:02.040]  There's this old genetic need to go to war,
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.040]  and we've got to stop it.
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:05.040]  And the globalists say,
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:07.040]  oh, we're bringing in a world government to end war,
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:09.040]  but they're creating more wars.
[02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:11.040]  Every reason they give is a lie.
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.040]  Now, I said we've got loaded phone lines.
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:18.040]  Samantha, Aaron, Dino, Leo, Brian, Jordan, Sue, and Brad,
[02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:20.040]  I'm going to take every one of your calls.
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  30 minutes we have left.
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:23.040]  When we go to break, come back.
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.040]  But that's just one of the clips.
[02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:27.040]  I told you I've got incredible clips.
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:32.040]  I mean, I've got to start doing podcasts
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:34.040]  to get the commercial free to get to all these clips
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:36.040]  because they're just nuts.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:39.040]  I mean, I've got stuff here that is just so insane.
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:41.040]  It'll make your head spin.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:49.040]  But just the cutting of the nitrogen off alone is totally insane.
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:52.040]  I mean, it's like to anybody that knows chemistry,
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:58.040]  or biology, or physics, or just anything,
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:01.040]  it's like saying they know you know water's good.
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:05.040]  Nitrogen's more important than water.
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:07.040]  Or you can say it's as important.
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:12.040]  I mean, if you don't have sunlight, nitrogen, and water, there's no life.
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:17.040]  Oxygen and carbon dioxide are like important third and fourths.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.040]  Fourth and fifths.
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:24.040]  I mean, you've got to have sunlight, got to have nitrogen, got to have water.
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:26.040]  And you don't even have to have water as much.
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:28.040]  I'm like, sunlight and nitrogen.
[02:27:28.040 --> 02:27:30.040]  So they know you know the sun's good.
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:31.040]  So they're like, well, we won't do that yet,
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:33.040]  but we're going to block that out to save the Earth.
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:35.040]  So actually, they've announced that at the White House.
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:36.040]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.040]  You're right.
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:38.040]  Okay, so the sun's bad now.
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:39.040]  All right.
[02:27:39.040 --> 02:27:40.040]  Okay, good.
[02:27:40.040 --> 02:27:41.040]  I agree.
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:42.040]  White supremacist, actually.
[02:27:42.040 --> 02:27:43.040]  Get rid of it.
[02:27:43.040 --> 02:27:44.040]  In fact, if they called it white supremacist,
[02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:45.040]  people were like, block the sun.
[02:27:45.040 --> 02:27:46.040]  Get rid of it.
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:47.040]  Blow it up.
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:48.040]  It's a white supremacist.
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:50.040]  The sun's bad.
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:52.040]  Nitrogen's bad.
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:55.040]  Carbon dioxide's bad.
[02:27:55.040 --> 02:27:56.040]  And what's next?
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:27:58.040]  Oxygen?
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.040]  Yeah.
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:02.040]  So nitrogen is bad.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.040]  Sunlight's bad.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:04.040]  Carbon dioxide's bad.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:11.040]  All that's left is water and oxygen.
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:13.040]  Does that sound alien to you?
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:15.040]  That's like why aliens would operate.
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:17.040]  Your water is bad.
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:18.040]  Your sun is bad.
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:21.040]  Your nitrogen is bad.
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:23.040]  Yes, ban our nitrogen.
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:24.040]  Ban our nitrogen.
[02:28:24.040 --> 02:28:28.040]  I mean, it's like it's so idiotic, maybe we deserve to die.
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:34.040]  I mean, if we're this dumb that we think sunlight and nitrogen and carbon dioxide are bad,
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:38.040]  instead of beam me up, Scotty, blow me up, Scotty.
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:42.040]  I mean, I've got to explain this to people?
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:44.040]  In two minutes, you're going to have a baby?
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:46.040]  It's insanity.
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:47.040]  It's madness.
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:49.040]  It's cuckoo land.

[02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:01.380]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:05.080]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:08.119]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[02:30:08.119 --> 02:30:09.880]  of this essential trace element,
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:12.280]  which has caused an iodine deficiency
[02:30:12.280 --> 02:30:14.119]  in about half the population.
[02:30:14.119 --> 02:30:16.960]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:20.240]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:22.520]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:24.880]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[02:30:24.880 --> 02:30:28.760]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:30:28.760 --> 02:30:30.040]  And we need to ensure
[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:33.540]  that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day.
[02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:35.940]  Derived from ancient sea salts
[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:39.060]  found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface,

[02:31:04.520 --> 02:31:07.440]  Maybe you're watching InfoWars today

[02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:12.240]  with the problems that we face in the world today.

[02:31:57.260 --> 02:32:02.960]  ♪♪
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:04.440]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:32:04.440 --> 02:32:06.280]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:09.560]  It is, but if you took it with fish oil,
[02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:11.820]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:13.160]  The fish oil's better than it,
[02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:14.980]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:32:14.980 --> 02:32:19.119]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[02:32:19.119 --> 02:32:20.560]  the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:23.400]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:25.280]  And I'm just sorry, you want something like this,
[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:26.260]  you don't get stuff for free.
[02:32:26.260 --> 02:32:28.180]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:29.420]  It's so good, in my view.
[02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.700]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:31.540]  but let me tell you something.
[02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:34.420]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:36.280]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:42.780]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:45.300]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:47.300]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:48.420]  but you notice I just obsess,
[02:32:48.420 --> 02:32:50.140]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:51.220]  I just can't lie to you.
[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:52.500]  I just can't do it.
[02:32:52.520 --> 02:32:53.619]  Gimbal or sword.
[02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:01.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:05.540]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:25.179]  Hey, teacher, leave the kids alone All in all, it's just a metal brick in the
[02:33:25.179 --> 02:33:32.839]  wall All in all, you're just a metal brick in the
[02:33:32.839 --> 02:33:33.839]  wall
[02:33:33.839 --> 02:33:40.759]  system is the establishment. The left is the big banks. They're BlackRock. They're the
[02:33:40.759 --> 02:33:53.400]  New World Order. They're the man. They're not the rebels. Crank it up. They're the enemy.
[02:33:53.400 --> 02:34:01.759]  The guy that wrote this is on our side. Adults are cancelled in the classroom. All the left
[02:34:01.759 --> 02:34:29.960]  is bullying. Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone. All in all. All in all. All in all.
[02:34:29.960 --> 02:34:43.560]  We don't listen to a damn thing you say, left, New World Order, loveless satanists. We're not
[02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:47.279]  right-wing. We're just common sense. We want to live. We don't want war. We don't want death.
[02:34:47.279 --> 02:34:51.039]  We want prosperity. We want families, men and women, children living together in the future.
[02:34:51.039 --> 02:34:58.640]  We have big plans. You're not hijacking us. You're taking our kindness for weakness. You're
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:04.839]  about to find out. Little more than those you've taken down. In the end, your demonic clowns will
[02:35:04.839 --> 02:35:14.480]  fail. All right, Samantha in Michigan, thanks for calling. Thanks for holding. You're a trooper. We
[02:35:14.480 --> 02:35:20.519]  appreciate you. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. To defeat the New World Order, I want to talk about a very
[02:35:20.519 --> 02:35:25.759]  powerful weapon that will help make that happen. And I hope this is both encouraging and a call
[02:35:25.759 --> 02:35:31.439]  to action for all of us. And you are the one, Alex, who helped me see this. A few weeks ago,
[02:35:31.439 --> 02:35:36.839]  UFOs were all over the news, and Tucker had released one of his episodes about it. And you
[02:35:36.839 --> 02:35:44.400]  responded to that with a great 30-plus minute segment on interdimensionality, vibrations,
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:50.320]  and frequencies. And you sent me down a rabbit hole that led me to the principle of the law
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:56.599]  of attraction and the movie The Secret. And so now I believe that a major source of defeat on
[02:35:56.599 --> 02:36:03.960]  the right in elections, in the culture wars, is that so many people on the right are negative
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:10.320]  and angry, and they love to complain, and they think and feel as victims. And as a result,
[02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:19.080]  they're giving off this subconscious vibrational stink that is expediting our defeat. And so I used
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:23.400]  to think like I was black-pilled, but act like I was white-pilled, because I'm very involved
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:31.720]  locally in local politics. But now I think and act like I'm white-pilled, because that is the
[02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:38.000]  reality that I am trying to attract. So that's what I wanted to say. Well, that's beautifully
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:42.119]  said, and I appreciate your call. I don't know if you can watch this on TV right now, but this
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:49.240]  story, 1,500 drones create a Chinese dragon in the night sky. The Chinese government did this.
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:54.599]  Think of what a weapons system that is. They could put bombs on those or guns on those,
[02:36:54.599 --> 02:36:59.160]  which they've done, and then send that against an army. Think of the incredible computer program
[02:36:59.160 --> 02:37:05.880]  that launches all those drones at once to fly in perfect sync. And think of what a weapon that is.
[02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:10.359]  And now the left's announced in Europe and the U.S. they're banning fireworks, if they can,
[02:37:10.679 --> 02:37:16.439]  to replace everything with drones. So they can have a weaponized drone system in every city that
[02:37:16.439 --> 02:37:21.400]  you believe is the fireworks program, but really it's the weapons cover. And I know what I'm
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:25.160]  talking about when I say this, folks. It's not my opinion. So this is the robot takeover,
[02:37:25.160 --> 02:37:28.599]  but think of the danger of that. Think of how incredible that is.
[02:37:32.359 --> 02:37:36.039]  Thanks for the call. I appreciate you. Ryan in Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:44.839]  Alex Jones, to the first caller of the day's point, James 1-5, he who lacks wisdom,
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:52.759]  look to the Lord. I suppose that's the reason that I'm talking to you today. Quick shout out
[02:37:52.759 --> 02:38:00.359]  to my twin brother, fellow Air Force vet, got the Alex Jones 2024 t-shirt and people love it.
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:10.839]  Thank you. So what we do, I don't know why, but you know, all of a sudden AI, chat GPT
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:20.519]  is everywhere. And the way I see it, it's probably a psyop where telling us AI is going to be evil
[02:38:20.519 --> 02:38:25.640]  and take us over to distract us from what they're really going to use it for.
[02:38:26.279 --> 02:38:31.480]  No, I totally agree. Chat GPT is not the deal. The real thing is censorship and control
[02:38:32.679 --> 02:38:35.320]  and a lot of other things what they're doing with AI.
[02:38:36.359 --> 02:38:44.519]  Yes, but my goal, actually, I'm studying computer science now using my GI Bill to do that.
[02:38:44.519 --> 02:38:49.080]  Good. We need good AI that we can work with.
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:53.320]  No, I totally agree. It's like any arms race. We're going to have to have human programmed
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:58.679]  AI to battle there. I totally agree with you. Yeah. And Alex, machine learning has been in
[02:38:58.679 --> 02:39:07.000]  our phones and it's already been in there. So machine learning has been in devices for a while.
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:12.519]  I'll tell you how insane it is. You think a text message app in your phone is about your text
[02:39:12.519 --> 02:39:17.240]  message. It's machine learning. So I can tell it listens to my conversations because now when I try
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:22.519]  to type something, whatever I last talked about, it's trying to say those words. And people say,
[02:39:22.519 --> 02:39:25.960]  oh, is it really listening to me? I noticed I talked about something that suddenly was in my
[02:39:25.960 --> 02:39:30.279]  ads. Yes. For over a decade. The microphone's always open, folks. It's listening to you.
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:39.240]  Of course. One hundred percent. Just everybody look. I mean, I DoorDash and they have an automatic,
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:45.320]  you know, an AI dispatch system. And I can tell that they are using their AI to siphon money
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:50.119]  from all the DoorDash drivers. You know, I've seen it. So AI is doing, you know,
[02:39:50.119 --> 02:39:54.839]  they're using it for that. We think of flash trading as a scam that Bloomberg made 80 million
[02:39:54.839 --> 02:40:00.519]  off of. This is next level scamming. So we need lawsuits. We need exposure. We expose it's being
[02:40:00.519 --> 02:40:06.679]  used as a scam. Not that any technology is bad inherently, but from the beginning, it is shaving
[02:40:06.679 --> 02:40:14.920]  money off people. It is scamming. And Google believes in their creating the God AI. You know,
[02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:21.880]  they want to have it for their own. We've got to get patriots in control of AI.
[02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.400]  Well, for people who don't know, when Google was founded 24 years ago,
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:30.679]  they said our goal is God like AI interface with humans. And that's what it is. Its power is that
[02:40:30.679 --> 02:40:36.920]  we give it data. And so it's an interface. Its power is that we respond to it and do what it
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:42.839]  says so that it actually makes it living because it's a machine interfacing with us. It's incredible.
[02:40:42.839 --> 02:40:47.240]  Appreciate your call. Amazing points, Brian. Brad in Kentucky. Thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:56.839]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for everything you do. I want to plug CBD first. My wife has had joint pain
[02:40:58.599 --> 02:41:04.039]  for a long time. And as long as she remembers to take her CBD morning and night, half a dose,
[02:41:05.240 --> 02:41:10.679]  she is pain free. And that's one of many products we're using of yours.
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.519]  Well, please elaborate on that, because for people that don't know real full spectrum CBD
[02:41:16.519 --> 02:41:21.160]  doesn't get you high as no THC. But in neurological studies, people with serious neurological
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:25.560]  problems, it mitigates or completely knocks it out. I mean, it's a plant God gave us.
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:27.960]  Describe what was going on with your wife. People want to know about this.
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:36.359]  So she has a gluten intolerance. And once she went gluten free, most of her pain was gone.
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:42.759]  I would say 70 percent of it roughly. Once she started taking the CBD,
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:49.880]  her joint pain is completely gone. She takes 10 drops in the morning, 10 drops at night,
[02:41:50.439 --> 02:41:52.039]  and she is completely pain free.
[02:41:54.519 --> 02:41:56.840]  Well, that's amazing. You know, that's our problem.
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:01.960]  What's a good problem with supply chain breakdown starting three years ago, we lost most of our
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:05.160]  makers because they couldn't get the products. People said, well, just go with this and lower
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:09.560]  the quality. I said, well, if it's not available, we'll lower it to what's available. But then that
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:15.000]  wasn't even available. And so that's why we didn't have CBD for years and have a probiotic for years.
[02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:18.039]  Didn't have some of the problem. But now they're all back as good as ever.
[02:42:18.679 --> 02:42:23.640]  Infowarshore.com. But yes, I think people should really take advantage of a thousand milligrams
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:29.000]  CBD. There's the lower strength that's great as well. Twenty five milligram in gummies. It just
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:36.759]  does amazing things. And I mean, I've got serious hip pain and injuries and things. And when I forget
[02:42:36.759 --> 02:42:43.000]  to take CBD, I feel it when I take it. No pain. I mean, that's that's amazing. Advil Tylenol doesn't
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.880]  do that. Prescription drugs don't do that. And so God gave us this. People should really get it.
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:53.720]  And we have one of the best CBD you're going to find at around 50 percent less than leading
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:58.759]  competitors. So people go to Infowarshore.com and get their CBD oil. But separate from that,
[02:42:58.759 --> 02:43:06.679]  what else do you want to add, sir? The kill switch. Karen Kingston, I started
[02:43:06.679 --> 02:43:13.320]  doing a lot of digging when when everything kicked off with the lockdowns. I wasn't yet
[02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:17.720]  listening to you. I've only listened to you for maybe a little over a year. And that was because
[02:43:18.439 --> 02:43:26.199]  the the main the mainstream media convinced me you were crazy when you were talking about 9-11.
[02:43:26.919 --> 02:43:31.880]  As soon as it happened, I know you were predicting it. You should know exactly what
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:39.880]  it would be. But I was listening to Steve Bannon's war room. He wasn't he wasn't going
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:46.119]  deep enough for me. So about a year ago, maybe a little over that, I started listening to you.
[02:43:46.840 --> 02:43:54.919]  And I wish I'd listened to you a long time ago. But so one of the huge advantages of globalists
[02:43:54.919 --> 02:44:00.359]  having all this is that what they're doing is insane. So when we try to tell people it's insane,
[02:44:00.359 --> 02:44:08.599]  they think we're insane. But Karen Kingston, back to my point, Karen Kingston has been covering
[02:44:08.599 --> 02:44:13.320]  this. She's a she's a biomedical analyst. She worked for Pfizer previously, and she's become
[02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:20.359]  a whistleblower essentially. So what she does or she used to do in her job was interpret patents
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:26.599]  and make sure that they were they were dismissed legally, that the company she was working for
[02:44:26.599 --> 02:44:34.759]  weren't going to get in hot water from a legal perspective. And if you just look her up,
[02:44:34.759 --> 02:44:42.359]  if anyone wants to look her up, it says in the patent that these shots are going to enable
[02:44:42.359 --> 02:44:48.919]  a Bluetooth system in people. And they do that through self-assembling nanoparticles.
[02:44:49.720 --> 02:44:53.560]  No, you're absolutely right. It is in the patents. And what you just said is true.
[02:44:54.199 --> 02:44:58.759]  We're normal. Want to go to church, pick up our kids, be nice to people. They treat us nice.
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:04.359]  We're confident we have what we want because we've got God. And these other people are not
[02:45:04.359 --> 02:45:10.279]  happy. They're insane. And so we keep saying they're like us. They're not, folks. Nothing
[02:45:10.279 --> 02:45:16.119]  makes sense until you realize they are homicidal lunatics. And then it all makes complete sense.
[02:45:16.119 --> 02:45:20.919]  It's all what can they do against God? How can they go against God's program?
[02:45:20.919 --> 02:45:22.759]  And once you figure that out, then it all makes sense.
[02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:32.519]  Yeah, that's why the little evil weasel, Harari, says that the days of free will are over,
[02:45:33.240 --> 02:45:39.240]  that we are we are hackable animals. That's exactly this is exactly what he's talking about.
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:45.320]  And I've tested myself and anyone can do this for the phone and a Bluetooth scanner app. All
[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:50.279]  you've got to do is isolate someone. I typically do it in a forest where there's no other Bluetooth
[02:45:50.279 --> 02:45:56.119]  signals around. And you can see the person's Bluetooth signal. It's absolute insanity. I've
[02:45:56.119 --> 02:46:03.080]  done this with dozens of people from multiple states across all manufacturers. This is absolutely
[02:46:03.080 --> 02:46:07.240]  100 percent real. Well, I've seen the videos described. So you can go to a forest where
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.560]  people are hiking. There's not a bunch of cars, not a parking lot. There's not an office building.
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:15.720]  And you can sit there with an app that scans Bluetooth and watch this person walks by.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:20.359]  They've got it. That person. I mean, I mean, describe how you do this so we can try to
[02:46:20.359 --> 02:46:27.320]  duplicate it. Yes. So you want a Bluetooth scanner app that will show unknown devices.
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:33.480]  They all show up as unknown devices. And you want to first of all, if you have a friend,
[02:46:33.480 --> 02:46:41.720]  a family member that is that's been poisoned, that's what I call it, then you want them to
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:48.279]  go with you and preferably some kind of witness so they can see your phone and just go into a
[02:46:48.279 --> 02:46:55.800]  remote area and where there's no way there's another Bluetooth signal around. And you show
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:00.279]  them, you can have them turn their phone off, take it off, anything that may emit a signal,
[02:47:00.279 --> 02:47:04.199]  watch, whatever, and take them into a remote area.
[02:47:05.880 --> 02:47:11.320]  And show them their signal, say, this is you. Now, please walk.
[02:47:11.320 --> 02:47:15.720]  Wow. So you're taking friends and family in the woods. They have no phone and they're
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:19.880]  saying there's a signal emitted from them. Yes, absolutely.
[02:47:19.880 --> 02:47:23.560]  For folks who don't know, the reason the patent is there and works, we're electrochemical,
[02:47:24.199 --> 02:47:29.160]  just like everything else in the universe that's alive. And so we have incredible electricity in
[02:47:29.160 --> 02:47:35.000]  us. Our heart is the most electrical part of us. Super electrical. And so that's what they
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.880]  see is that it's literally putting into you this interface or this plug, basically. What
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:46.279]  do you think the larger plan is, Brad? I think it's control. And that could be
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:51.880]  control from the perspective of Karen Kingston. I really think you need to get her on to talk
[02:47:51.880 --> 02:47:57.000]  about this. She says that it says right in the patent. She's shown it in interviews.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:02.599]  No, I've seen it. It says it. It's there. It can act as a kill switch. They can just,
[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:07.640]  you know, and that's why she's a big proponent of taking down 5G,
[02:48:08.439 --> 02:48:13.320]  because they as long as the 5G is active, which is why I think there won't be
[02:48:14.119 --> 02:48:19.400]  mass power outages like across. I want to keep that weapon system in place. All right. Amazing
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:23.160]  calls. We'll look more into it. I know it's real, Brad. Thank you so much. We're definitely not in
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:27.240]  Kansas anymore. Leo in Minnesota. I've got to move quicker to get to everybody. Go ahead,
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:32.679]  Leo. You're on the air. Man, your last caller was 100 percent on target. And
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:40.919]  it was a woman. You had a doctor who was a COVID whistleblower, and she was actually showing
[02:48:41.480 --> 02:48:46.199]  videos of Chinese dudes that were actually like looking up in the air and grasping for
[02:48:46.199 --> 02:48:51.720]  something and falling out, dying. Absolutely. Yeah, it's happening everywhere. But I wanted
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.439]  to touch on the Internet shutting off in France and how if that happens here in America,
[02:48:56.439 --> 02:49:00.599]  it's going to be the perfect distraction to take out people like you, Alex Jones,
[02:49:00.599 --> 02:49:05.160]  people like me who are proud boys. Shout out to all my proud boys all around the country.
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:11.480]  This is going to be a false flag attack to go after conservatives. And there will be no coverage
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:15.960]  of it because the Internet will be off and everybody will be in the dark. So we've got
[02:49:15.960 --> 02:49:22.199]  to watch out for France 2.0 coming to America and not having Freedom General Alex Jones
[02:49:22.199 --> 02:49:29.000]  transmit live for us all to get our intel from. Well, I agree they're going to try to use racial
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:33.480]  riots for control. It seems like Americans aren't buying it, though, like the Europeans,
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:38.039]  but it's still something to look out for. But we did buy for it with George Floyd,
[02:49:38.039 --> 02:49:42.279]  and I've seen those exact riots that are going on in France happen in places like Minneapolis
[02:49:42.279 --> 02:49:47.000]  that I'm in now. So, you know, it's not exactly migrants that they're going to
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.880]  activate here. It's radical, crazy leftists. But if I can, before I get off the phone with you,
[02:49:51.880 --> 02:49:55.320]  Alex, I'd like to say a prayer for America on its birthday, please.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:02.119]  Dear Lord, we bow our heads and we come together on the greatest platform.
[02:50:02.119 --> 02:50:07.320]  Humanity is brought to humanity, led by the General Alex Jones himself. And we're here,
[02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:12.919]  Lord, to give it all up to you and ask your guidance. We are living in the greatest country
[02:50:12.919 --> 02:50:17.800]  on the planet, but it's under attack and there's a threat that this country may not exist anymore.
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:25.800]  And living to see the big 2.5.0 for America is something that, you know, is really not around
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:31.080]  the corner for us if we can't turn it around. So I just want God to watch over all my proud
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:35.320]  boys for when the internet kill switch comes here. Keep an eye over all these conservatives
[02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.880]  and these hard-fighting Americans and just pray we see it through. Amen.
[02:50:42.199 --> 02:50:47.560]  And I forget the numbers. We don't look at it from July 4th. We look at it from
[02:50:48.119 --> 02:50:53.400]  the Constitution and all that. How old is the U.S. today? It's like 240 what?
[02:50:54.359 --> 02:50:55.800]  47, I believe.
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:02.759]  Yeah. It's crazy. Well, no country's ever lived that long, so we'll see what happens. I appreciate
[02:51:02.759 --> 02:51:07.960]  your call. Amazing points, Leo. Man, great callers. Dino in Chicago, thanks for holding.
[02:51:09.160 --> 02:51:14.279]  Oh, hi, Mr. Alex. I just, you know, I'm calling in today. I just wanted to thank you for, you know,
[02:51:15.560 --> 02:51:19.560]  being here for all these hundreds of thousands of people that watch you every single day.
[02:51:20.279 --> 02:51:26.759]  You've been a true inspiration to me. My father introduced me to you. He's been watching you for
[02:51:26.759 --> 02:51:34.199]  15, 16 years. And, you know, when he turned me on to you, you know, I already had, you know,
[02:51:34.199 --> 02:51:42.039]  conservative ideas. But you just brought me to a point where I was like, wow, this guy is amazing.
[02:51:42.039 --> 02:51:45.240]  Well, Dino, I appreciate you holding for an hour to get on. How old are you?
[02:51:46.519 --> 02:51:47.720]  I'm 14, sir.
[02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:51.240]  Well, God bless you. What's your view on what's happening right now?
[02:51:52.199 --> 02:51:58.759]  I think it's just terrible. You know, in my school, there's been like, you know,
[02:51:58.759 --> 02:52:04.840]  the satanic ideologies being taught to me and other students. And I have friends that also
[02:52:04.840 --> 02:52:12.279]  disagree with the fact of what they're doing in the school. I think that it needs to be stopped.
[02:52:12.279 --> 02:52:19.960]  I think, you know, that what they're doing is absolutely demonic and bad for little kids,
[02:52:20.039 --> 02:52:26.199]  especially, you know, to see this. It's terrible. And hopefully we can change it with your help.
[02:52:26.919 --> 02:52:27.640]  And yeah.
[02:52:28.919 --> 02:52:33.640]  Well, I'm trying, brother. But yeah, the left is openly satanic now, but that at least gets
[02:52:33.640 --> 02:52:37.320]  them out in the open. You know, children even respond against parents saying, don't use drugs,
[02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:41.800]  be good, you know, take care of your family because we have that built in thing to resist.
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:45.960]  But imagine the rebellion I'm seeing against satanism and pedophilia by the young people
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:51.080]  is amazing. I see it really being rejected. They're only really getting autistic people,
[02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:55.960]  which is really sad. And mentally retarded folks, which had a member of parliament a few years ago
[02:52:55.960 --> 02:53:01.320]  from England, saying half the transgenders are mentally retarded. So they're getting the
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:05.560]  weakest of us. It's very, very sad. But the good news is, it seems like with most young people,
[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:14.119]  it's backfiring. Are you seeing that? Yeah, yeah, 100%. And, you know, I see
[02:53:15.080 --> 02:53:22.840]  they're taking advantage of children who don't know much and especially, you know,
[02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:30.840]  teaching them the thinking that it's normal, you know, to do this. And in my school,
[02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:40.119]  there are many people, you know, who I express my ideologies to. And, you know, I just get backfire
[02:53:40.439 --> 02:53:48.359]  for it and more backfire and more backfire. So it's, it's just how brainwashed society can be
[02:53:48.359 --> 02:53:55.560]  today. It's, it's terrible. Well, keep it up, brother. Just, you know, Chicago's once great
[02:53:55.560 --> 02:54:01.000]  city, like Austin is now, you know, I left this overrun system, but it's always darkest for the
[02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:04.840]  dawn. Thank you so much, Dino. Good to have you listening. And we want to thank your father for
[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:09.080]  having you tune in. Well, since I mentioned this like an hour ago, I actually remember to send the
[02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:16.679]  crew this. So an elevator in Omaha to visit my sick father-in-law. And this guy gets on the
[02:54:16.679 --> 02:54:22.439]  elevator shaking in hate. So I say, let me look at him. And he's got a shirt that says Pride Month,
[02:54:22.439 --> 02:54:27.880]  but it says Demon in the middle. Pride Month says Demon. And it's a devil in front of a rainbow
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:34.519]  letting you know, hey, the rainbow is really the devil. I thought we had that. We don't have that.
[02:54:35.240 --> 02:54:41.160]  All right. Pulling it up now. So there it is. Yeah. Now go ahead and zoom in on that.
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:45.960]  And that's sold by Target with guillotines also cutting Christian's heads off. They're going to
[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:50.519]  kill us. They're going to get us because they're so oppressed and they think we don't like the
[02:54:50.519 --> 02:54:53.240]  devil. So they wear this, but no, really they're under the control of the devil.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:55:01.160]  It's very, very sad. So it's a man in a dress with high heels on
[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:07.640]  and what devil is sterilizing children? What devil is chopping their genitals off? What
[02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:12.679]  devil's cutting little girls breast off? Where is the human sacrifice? It is the transgender movement.
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:19.240]  And what is the transgender colors? Pink and blue, neutralized to white,
[02:55:20.039 --> 02:55:24.119]  sterilizing your children. It is the modern sacrifice. They're not just
[02:55:24.119 --> 02:55:29.000]  having fun with abortion. No, no, no. They're going to get your babies now.
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:35.240]  All right. Aaron, Jordan, and Sue, I'm going to cram you all in here in the end of this segment,
[02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:41.800]  the next, and I'm going to tape a special first 30 minutes for tomorrow's July 4th. I'll be back

[02:56:18.679 --> 02:56:24.039]  holding. Go ahead. It's great to meet you, Alex. How are you doing? Fighting hard, brother. I'm
[02:56:24.039 --> 02:56:30.919]  very glad to talk to you. Being as you were just talking about the rainbow collars, there's a
[02:56:30.919 --> 02:56:37.000]  Messianic Jew. His name is Jonathan Kahn. Have you ever heard of him? It rings a bell.
[02:56:38.199 --> 02:56:46.279]  Jonathan Kahn was talking about Ishtar or Ashtaroth at the time of the Mesopotamian Empire.
[02:56:46.840 --> 02:56:58.840]  And he said that characteristics of Ishtar was rainbow eyes and also Ishtar's ability that she
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:03.640]  would exercise was turning men into women and women into men. Yes, that's in the Bible. Yes.
[02:57:04.199 --> 02:57:10.919]  Yep. And conveniently, he brought up the point that he said that the month that they
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:18.840]  had selected to celebrate and uplift Ishtar's name was June.
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:27.240]  And so this is a this is a historical entity that is seems to be arising.
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:33.480]  Again, don't hang up, Aaron. I'm going to come back to you and we're going to finish up with
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:40.199]  you and then Jordan and Sue and then I'm going to bring Gerald Cilente in and then 3 p.m. Central

[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:55.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:59.900 --> 03:00:02.900]  Take the highway to the end.
[03:00:02.900 --> 03:00:05.900]  All right, final segment before Gerald Solentik takes over.
[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:09.900]  Always informative, always hilarious, always entertaining.
[03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:12.900]  But Aaron, real quick, tell me the name of the Jewish rabbi.
[03:00:12.900 --> 03:00:16.900]  I was aware of Asheroth and that in the Bible and other cultures, saying that's what Asheroth did.
[03:00:16.900 --> 03:00:19.900]  But who was the name of the rabbi, and any other points you want to add?
[03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:23.900]  His name was Jonathan Cahn. You can find him on YouTube.
[03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:27.900]  He actually wrote a book discussing what I'm telling you.
[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:37.900]  And he also said the role of Ishtar or Asheroth, either name works, was also to deliver the children to Moloch,
[03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:46.900]  to set the stage for delivering these children to the next demon that would come or be more prominent in society.
[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:55.900]  And basically, whenever Moloch came in, he's part of a three-part stage of what you see in society.
[03:00:55.900 --> 03:01:04.900]  You have Baal come in who basically runs God out of the government entities and out of basically the social eye.
[03:01:04.900 --> 03:01:10.900]  You can basically get him prayer out of schools, Ten Commandments and things.
[03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:20.900]  And then you have Asheroth come in who starts tampering with sexual promiscuity and changing the culture into perversion.
[03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:24.900]  And then she sets the stage for delivering the children over to Moloch.
[03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:32.900]  And then when Moloch comes in, that's kind of a final stage where basically culture has just been destroyed because the children have been destroyed.
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:35.900]  Incredible. Thank you for the call. Dead-on historic fact.
[03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:38.900]  Jordan in Florida, thanks for calling.
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:41.900]  Hey, Alex. Can you hear me?
[03:01:41.900 --> 03:01:43.900]  I can. Go ahead.
[03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:54.900]  Wow. So I just first want to say real quick that you and Stephen Crowder are the two only people that are the reason why I'm actually paying attention to everything that's going on right now in the world
[03:01:54.900 --> 03:01:59.900]  and the reason why I'm awake, along with tons of other people around me.
[03:01:59.900 --> 03:02:05.900]  But I just wanted to mention about our currency system and how that's going to hell.
[03:02:05.900 --> 03:02:14.900]  So the U.S. dollar, since 2017, Stephen Mnuchin's name was on the bill, right?
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:17.900]  For the Secretary of the Treasury or something like that.
[03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:26.900]  Well, now, if you look at all of your bills, besides the coins, coins are different.
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:32.900]  They're still printing those, but I don't know where all the cash is going that they've been printing since 2017.
[03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:38.900]  But none of the bills that you look at, like if you look at your cash right now, if you have any cash.
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:40.900]  Sure. What's on it? What are you saying?
[03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:45.900]  Well, they're not printing anything later than 2017.
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:54.900]  There's no bills that are made after 2017 for some reason, and I haven't heard anybody talking about it, and nobody really seems to know why.
[03:02:54.900 --> 03:02:59.900]  So they're not putting dates on the money now because there's so much they don't want to show how much they're printing.
[03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:02.900]  I haven't thought of that. I'll look it up. Is that true? Wow, that's crazy.
[03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:11.900]  Yeah, I haven't heard a single person mentioning it, and I've been meaning to call you for a long time, for a few years now, and I'm so glad I finally got through.
[03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:15.900]  Jordan, guys, look that up right now. We'll do a report on it. Thank you. We're out of time. Thank you.
[03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:20.900]  Janet, one more. Sue in California, go ahead.
[03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:21.900]  Hello, Alex.
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:23.900]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:26.900]  Hi, long time listener, and I love your product.
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:27.900]  Thank you.
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:32.900]  And I came up with an idea and wanted to run it by you to see what you think.
[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:40.900]  I strongly believe that we need to get Biden out of the office ASAP, and impeachment takes a long time.
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:54.900]  So here's my thought. We all know he's got dementia. So what if we put pressure on the House of Representatives to force Biden to take a competency test?
[03:03:54.900 --> 03:04:06.900]  And if he is proven to be incompetent and has dementia, then wouldn't that disqualify him as being president? And wouldn't that be faster than impeachment?
[03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:12.900]  Sure, sure. But I mean, I don't know there's constitutional power to do that. Then we got Kamala Harris, but definitely they want to get rid of him.
[03:04:12.900 --> 03:04:20.900]  Politico today, why Democrats should primary Biden. Here's another one. We need a serious conversation about Biden's brain.
[03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:26.900]  They're getting ready to remove him and put Gavin Newsom in. Roger Stone thinks it's Big Mike, Michelle Obama.
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:29.900]  But thank you so much. I'm sorry out of time, Sue. Great point.
[03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  All right. Gerald Salente, a dynamo, the trends forecaster, takes over in one minute.
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:44.900]  We got a break. And then in 55 minutes from now, Owen Schroer and the war room.
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:47.900]  We're only here because of your support. Please spread the word and pray for us.
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:52.900]  I'm very thankful and very supportive of you and very humble. Thank you all for your support.
[03:04:52.900 --> 03:04:57.900]  Please go to him for our store. I come. Great job. Crew.
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:05.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic book that documents the globalist in their own words, planned for our future.
[03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:10.900]  That is a hellish future. Now, you'll always, while they still have books, I guess they're starting to ban them.
[03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:16.900]  Be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores, Amazon or Infowars.com.
[03:05:16.900 --> 03:05:21.900]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:05:21.900 --> 03:05:29.900]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowars.com.
[03:05:29.900 --> 03:05:33.900]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:39.900]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:43.900]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:05:43.900 --> 03:05:53.900]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowars.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[03:05:53.900 --> 03:05:56.900]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:05:57.900 --> 03:06:20.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:06:21.900 --> 03:06:32.900]  It's great being on The Alex Jones Show, particularly as we head toward Independence Day.
[03:06:32.900 --> 03:06:37.900]  What independence are you talking about? You got no independence.
[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:45.900]  Hey, you know, I am. I'm your politician. I'll tell you what to do.
[03:06:46.900 --> 03:06:51.900]  What independence are you talking about? Don't you know who I am?
[03:06:51.900 --> 03:07:05.900]  Hey, hey. I'm Gavin Newsom. I'm Witness Whitmer. I'm DeWine over here in Ohio.
[03:07:05.900 --> 03:07:10.900]  I'm little Andy Cuomo. My daddy was Mario.
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:15.900]  My daddy was Mario. Rename the Tappan Zee Bridge. Rename the Tappan Zee Bridge.
[03:07:15.900 --> 03:07:20.900]  It's only going to cost you plantation workers of Slavelandia $30 million.
[03:07:20.900 --> 03:07:26.900]  Close down your business. COVID's coming. COVID's coming.
[03:07:26.900 --> 03:07:29.900]  Stay home.
[03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:34.100]  Shut down your restaurant!
[03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:37.100]  Hey! Independence Day?
[03:07:37.100 --> 03:07:39.100]  Screw you!
[03:07:39.100 --> 03:07:42.100]  What independence are you talking about?
[03:07:42.100 --> 03:07:45.100]  I'm in charge!
[03:07:45.100 --> 03:07:47.100]  Hey!
[03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:51.100]  I'm Warren William Jr.
[03:07:51.100 --> 03:07:55.100]  I'm some slob from New York City.
[03:07:55.100 --> 03:07:58.100]  Changed my name to de Blasio
[03:07:58.100 --> 03:08:01.100]  to get the Italian-Americans vote.
[03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:03.100]  My mother was de Blasio.
[03:08:03.100 --> 03:08:05.100]  You're a piece of scum!
[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:09.100]  You're a phony piece of scum like the rest of them.
[03:08:09.100 --> 03:08:11.100]  Independence Day?
[03:08:11.100 --> 03:08:13.100]  Screw you!
[03:08:13.100 --> 03:08:16.100]  Shut down your businesses!
[03:08:16.100 --> 03:08:18.100]  Oh! Oh!
[03:08:18.100 --> 03:08:21.100]  Bring in the ships to New York Harbor!
[03:08:21.100 --> 03:08:23.100]  The hospital ships!
[03:08:23.100 --> 03:08:27.100]  Close down the Javits Convention Center!
[03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:29.100]  No conventions!
[03:08:29.100 --> 03:08:32.100]  People are going to be dying!
[03:08:32.100 --> 03:08:34.100]  Dying all over the place!
[03:08:34.100 --> 03:08:37.100]  And we're going to need a place for them to die.
[03:08:37.700 --> 03:08:40.700]  COVID'S GONNA GET YOU! COVID'S GONNA GET YOU!
[03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:44.700]  Killed me. Yep, not me. This isn't me.
[03:08:44.700 --> 03:08:47.700]  COVID KILLED ME!
[03:08:47.700 --> 03:08:50.700]  Yeah, I didn't get the vax.
[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:52.700]  Oh, you know what I did?
[03:08:52.700 --> 03:08:55.700]  Natural healing. Yeah.
[03:08:55.700 --> 03:08:58.700]  First book I worked on, 1988.
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:02.700]  Natural Healing by Dr. Jack Saltinoff. I won a book.
[03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:05.700]  Oh, I built up my immune system and got stronger.
[03:09:06.700 --> 03:09:11.700]  YOU ONLY HAVE TO TAKE THE DRUGS THAT WE SELL YOU!
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:14.700]  WE'RE THE DRUG LORDS IN CHARGE!
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:17.700]  Hey! Hey!
[03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:20.700]  I took out the domain name, Blimpitis.
[03:09:20.700 --> 03:09:23.700]  Because that's what America's floating into.
[03:09:23.700 --> 03:09:25.700]  Yep, the blimp world of America.
[03:09:25.700 --> 03:09:27.700]  Keep eating that crap.
[03:09:27.700 --> 03:09:29.700]  Don't raise your children.
[03:09:29.700 --> 03:09:31.700]  Send them to nursery schools.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:33.700]  Nursing homes for kids.
[03:09:33.700 --> 03:09:36.700]  Don't feed them well. Don't take care of them.
[03:09:36.700 --> 03:09:38.700]  Let them eat crap. Let them eat crap.
[03:09:38.700 --> 03:09:40.700]  And all you have to do is take this drug,
[03:09:40.700 --> 03:09:43.700]  and you'll lose 15% of the blob you put on
[03:09:43.700 --> 03:09:45.700]  from eating crap.
[03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:49.400]  What Independence Day!
[03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:55.840]  It's been robbed from us!
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:10:01.199]  We've lost it!
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:04.800]  And if we don't fight back for freedom...
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:11.600]  We are on the cusp of nuclear annihilation.
[03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:25.560]  Listen to what, week after week, this guy Medvedev from Russia is warning about a nuclear
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:30.840]  exchange, one after another, we're putting it in the Trends Journal each week.
[03:10:30.840 --> 03:10:36.320]  They're running ads, Business Insider doing columns, what foods to eat and what to do,
[03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:41.120]  another one on a nuclear Armageddon.
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:45.160]  We have lunatics in charge, they have robbed us of our freedom.
[03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:53.960]  So in celebration of July 4th, Independence Day, do you can't just support Infowars, because
[03:10:53.960 --> 03:10:55.560]  they're stealing freedom from us.
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:03.600]  And Infowars is giving you all that they can to keep it going, and they're paying the price, as I am.
[03:11:04.600 --> 03:11:08.600]  And if you want to know history before it happens, you want the Trends Journal.
[03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:15.600]  And if you want to tell politicians, hey politicians, who the F are you to tell me what to do,
[03:11:16.600 --> 03:11:18.600]  you can get these at TrendsJournal.com and you go to the shop.
[03:11:19.600 --> 03:11:22.600]  So that's independent states, it's up to you to do something.
[03:11:22.600 --> 03:11:25.600]  United we stand, divided we die.
[03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:28.600]  They've robbed us of our independence.
[03:11:29.600 --> 03:11:31.600]  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:33.600]  Screw you, what happiness?
[03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:36.600]  Misery is all we know how to sell.
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:39.600]  Hey, look at Lindsey Graham.
[03:11:40.600 --> 03:11:42.600]  Look at that slobby little arrogant clown.
[03:11:44.200 --> 03:11:48.200]  War mongering little freak.
[03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:51.200]  You want to go fight? Go fight or shut your mouth.
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:55.200]  Anybody that supports the Ukraine war, go over there and fight.
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:12:01.200]  Send your money, send your wife, send your kids, send your transgenders, send your anybody, anywhere.
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:06.200]  Go fight. If you support the war, send your money or shut your mouth.
[03:12:06.100 --> 03:12:10.100]  Shut your mouth.
[03:12:11.300 --> 03:12:14.300]  B.S. is cheap.
[03:12:14.300 --> 03:12:16.300]  Put your money where your mouth is.
[03:12:16.300 --> 03:12:18.300]  And your body.
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:22.200]  Don't take my money!
[03:12:22.500 --> 03:12:28.580]  I've given enough to the military-industrial complex.
[03:12:28.580 --> 03:12:31.380]  Happy 4th of July!
[03:12:31.380 --> 03:12:34.500]  And we're celebrating it.
[03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:38.660]  I have American flags all over my garden, all year round.
[03:12:38.660 --> 03:12:42.020]  Somebody said to me, oh, you have all those flags up for 4th of July.
[03:12:42.020 --> 03:12:44.660]  I said, no, they're here all the time.
[03:12:44.660 --> 03:12:46.420]  The seeds of democracy were sown here.
[03:12:47.500 --> 03:12:51.500]  And I had the most historic buildings in the world, in America.
[03:12:51.500 --> 03:12:55.500]  Placed on corners were pre-revolutionary war stone buildings.
[03:12:55.500 --> 03:12:57.500]  I own three of them. The others are museum.
[03:12:57.500 --> 03:13:02.500]  I bought them because they were to represent the seeds of democracy were sown here.
[03:13:02.500 --> 03:13:05.500]  Four corners of freedom. Independence Day.
[03:13:05.500 --> 03:13:09.500]  So do what you can to support Infowars, especially on this Independence Day.
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:12.500]  Because we need to stay independent.
[03:13:12.500 --> 03:13:14.500]  And they've censored us like crazy.
[03:13:14.500 --> 03:13:15.500]  Misinformation.
[03:13:15.500 --> 03:13:21.500]  If you don't swallow the crap that clowns like Rachel Levin are putting out,
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:23.500]  it's misinformation.
[03:13:23.500 --> 03:13:25.500]  Which I find sexist.
[03:13:25.500 --> 03:13:28.500]  Let's call it gender information, not misinformation.
[03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:34.540]  Can't say blacklisted anymore.
[03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:44.600]  So do what you can, because we're going into very, very treacherous times.
[03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:50.240]  And I've been at this for 43 years, and the media is just diverting it.
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:57.840]  From today's New York Times, front page, a dream voyage, a slow descent, and then debris.
[03:13:57.840 --> 03:13:59.960]  Four dollars for this.
[03:13:59.960 --> 03:14:02.040]  Four dollars for this crap.
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:03.040]  What the hell do I care?
[03:14:03.040 --> 03:14:04.320]  How many weeks am I going to hear about this?
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:06.120]  I wonder how Johnny Depp is doing now.
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:07.680]  Ever hear of Amber Heard?
[03:14:07.680 --> 03:14:09.360]  Haven't heard of him anymore.
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:12.120]  That's the crap that they're putting out.
[03:14:12.120 --> 03:14:18.040]  We give you history before it happens in the Trends Journal, and InfoWars is giving information
[03:14:18.040 --> 03:14:21.160]  you're not getting in one place anywhere else.
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:23.720]  I go there every day, look at the stories they're putting up.
[03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:26.920]  You can't find a lot of them on the media.
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:29.140]  Most of them.
[03:14:29.140 --> 03:14:31.100]  So keep the independent spirit going.
[03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:34.200]  Support Independence Day.
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:36.200]  It's up to you.
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:40.200]  Again, united we stand, divided we die.
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:50.200]  And remember, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, said Samuel Adams.
[03:14:52.100 --> 03:14:58.100]  And with that irate, tireless minority, you call these clowns out, man to man.
[03:15:00.100 --> 03:15:06.100]  They don't know whether to pee or poo. Don't you talk to me like that. Don't you. Don't you talk to me like that.
[03:15:07.100 --> 03:15:11.100]  Don't you tell me what to do. Public servant.
[03:15:12.100 --> 03:15:18.100]  Public servant. Roll out the red carpet. Here comes the president. Don't forget to salute.
[03:15:18.100 --> 03:15:21.100]  Don't forget to salute. Yeah, salute.
[03:15:22.100 --> 03:15:23.100]  Yep.
[03:15:24.100 --> 03:15:26.100]  Here's the other salute.
[03:15:26.800 --> 03:15:27.800]  Got it?
[03:15:28.800 --> 03:15:29.800]  There it is.
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:31.800]  Hey, politicians.
[03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:35.800]  It's the back of your shirt.
[03:15:40.800 --> 03:15:42.800]  We're in treacherous times.
[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:45.800]  It's up to you to change it.
[03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:51.800]  People are disgusted with what's going on.
[03:15:56.800 --> 03:15:58.800]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[03:15:59.800 --> 03:16:03.800]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies.
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:08.800]  And that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication, it takes commitment.
[03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:12.800]  That's why I ask listeners respectfully to go to InfoWarStore.com

[03:17:38.800 --> 03:17:39.800]  But in this major recession, going into depression,

[03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:50.800]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:52.800]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[03:19:21.800 --> 03:19:22.800]  But the one thing that I have really found
[03:19:23.800 --> 03:19:25.800]  that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[03:19:26.800 --> 03:19:27.800]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning,
[03:19:28.800 --> 03:19:29.800]  right before I go to my computer,

[03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:39.800]  and it helps me with my writing.

[03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:47.800]  and Turbo Force at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:19:48.800 --> 03:19:49.800]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[03:19:50.800 --> 03:19:51.800]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:25.800]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:35.840]  As I said, this is Mars Independence Day.
[03:20:35.840 --> 03:20:39.960]  These little slime balls have robbed us of our independence.
[03:20:39.960 --> 03:20:41.560]  Little jerks.
[03:20:41.560 --> 03:20:43.480]  Little boys and girls.
[03:20:43.480 --> 03:20:47.160]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[03:20:47.160 --> 03:20:48.160]  I was there.
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:55.679]  I used to run major political campaigns as the top guy in Westchester County in the 1970s.
[03:20:55.679 --> 03:20:57.199]  I've been on the other side.
[03:20:57.199 --> 03:20:59.320]  That's why I know what I know.
[03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:03.920]  I've been with presidents, prime ministers, and princes.
[03:21:03.920 --> 03:21:08.720]  This is a freak show, and they're destroying our lives in front of us.
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:11.880]  When I said I worked on books, here, this is natural healing.
[03:21:11.880 --> 03:21:13.480]  This is a Warner book.
[03:21:13.600 --> 03:21:26.120]  1986, another one of my books, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine,
[03:21:26.120 --> 03:21:27.680]  1989.
[03:21:27.680 --> 03:21:33.400]  Trends 2000, another Warner book, an international bestseller.
[03:21:33.400 --> 03:21:42.460]  So I'm angry because, as St. Thomas Aquinas says, if you're not angry when it's morally
[03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:53.820]  correct to be angry because of the injustices that we are living through, then you are immoral
[03:21:53.820 --> 03:21:56.340]  for not being angry.
[03:21:56.340 --> 03:21:59.660]  And I'm a fighter, I just don't talk.
[03:21:59.660 --> 03:22:07.820]  I have peace rallies, I put out a magazine like no other magazine in the world, no peers
[03:22:07.820 --> 03:22:10.540]  to the Trends Journal.
[03:22:10.540 --> 03:22:14.340]  If you hate, freedom is speech.
[03:22:15.400 --> 03:22:25.760]  If you're too stupid to think for yourself, you'll hate the Trends Journal
[03:22:25.760 --> 03:22:30.600]  because it's the truth in trends.
[03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:32.200]  We have no peers.
[03:22:34.200 --> 03:22:36.200]  It's history before it happens.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:44.560]  So, I'm angry because I see the future.
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:59.080]  This is from CNBC today, Russia's Medvedev says Ukraine conflict could last decades.
[03:22:59.080 --> 03:23:04.760]  Talks of odds of a nuclear threat, got it?
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:10.920]  I will note one thing that politicians of all stripes do not like to admit, he said,
[03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:16.440]  such an apocalypse is not only possible, but it's quite probable.
[03:23:17.100 --> 03:23:20.100]  Yep.
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:31.640]  He said, Moscow remains committed to preventing Ukraine from joining NATO.
[03:23:31.640 --> 03:23:37.039]  Our goal, he said, is simple, to eliminate the threat of Ukraine's membership in NATO
[03:23:37.039 --> 03:23:40.199]  and we will achieve it.
[03:23:40.199 --> 03:23:43.920]  You don't have to be a visionary to understand that the confrontation phase will be very
[03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:47.039]  long to stand off the last decades.
[03:23:47.039 --> 03:23:49.359]  Oh, great, great.
[03:23:49.359 --> 03:23:51.640]  It keeps sending money.
[03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:56.279]  NATO and the United States is up to about $140 billion, yeah.
[03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:10.080]  Oh, all you Brits over there with inflation skyrocketing and some 2 million of you about
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:15.560]  to lose your homes because of high interest rates and your adjustable rate mortgages,
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:17.800]  we have to arm Ukraine.
[03:24:17.800 --> 03:24:21.880]  Why the sun never sets in the British Empire.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:25.480]  We've slaughtered people all over the world.
[03:24:25.480 --> 03:24:28.160]  They were number one.
[03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:36.160]  France is right there, America's catching up, but nobody's better than we are.
[03:24:36.160 --> 03:24:41.320]  So we're stealing your money and we keep bloodying the killing fields.
[03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:42.800]  Peace is prohibited.
[03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:47.740]  No peace allowed.
[03:24:47.740 --> 03:24:49.380]  You know why?
[03:24:49.380 --> 03:24:59.619]  Because the people that are running our lives, the politicians, are pieces of crap.
[03:24:59.619 --> 03:25:09.180]  They are demonic, evil, warmongering pieces of crap.
[03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:11.580]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[03:25:11.580 --> 03:25:14.980]  No, no, Sylvester, you have to say it properly.
[03:25:14.980 --> 03:25:23.060]  Folks, we need to get rid of that man, that violent man, who's robbing the people of their
[03:25:23.060 --> 03:25:27.619]  freedom and rights in Libya, the richest country in the world, in Africa.
[03:25:27.619 --> 03:25:32.020]  Hey, I'm Barack Obama, I'm the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[03:25:32.020 --> 03:25:35.500]  Yeah, all you stupid people elected me, yeah.
[03:25:35.500 --> 03:25:37.220]  I said we're going to get you out of Iraq.
[03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:38.220]  Well, I kept it going.
[03:25:38.220 --> 03:25:41.779]  Oh, yeah, yeah, hey, remember the, uh...
[03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:49.000]  The Afghan war, how he ramped that up? He had a special operation? Oh, yeah.
[03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  I want that guy assault out of there.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:58.000]  Quoted in a book, I'm really good at killing people, the book Double Down.
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:02.000]  Biden, the warmongering freak.
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  Oh, boy, and what's going on there in Israel, as I say, when all sales, they take you to war,
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:15.000]  people protesting, protesting, protesting, going on, I think, 25 weeks against the judicial reforms
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  putting in by the Netanyahu government, which actually robs the politicians become the judges.
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  People protesting. Now they just shut down Ben Grieve Airport.
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.000]  Yeah. Taken to the streets, closing it down.
[03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.000]  So what is Israel doing?
[03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:45.000]  Well, according to the news, launching its largest military operation.
[03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:50.000]  In 20 years against the Palestinians in Geneva.
[03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  Yep. When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:27:02.000]  Gets the people's mind off it. Go back to the dot-com bust.
[03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  We're going to get that guy, Osama bin Laden, get her alive.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000]  I'm little Georgie Bush.
[03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  And 88% of the people swallow the crap coming out of my mouth.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:17.000]  Yeah.
[03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:21.000]  There you go. Biggest military operation.
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:27.000]  As the protests, and Netanyahu, one of the things he's trying to get rid of the judiciary
[03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  is because he's brought up on charges.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:36.000]  And if he's not prime minister anymore, they bring him up on his charges.
[03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:39.000]  It's a crime syndicate in a country near you.
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  That little cut stone, Macron, look what's going on in France.
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:48.400]  Now look at the clown show. Look at the little clowns.
[03:27:48.400 --> 03:27:52.400]  My daddy's Prince Scott Bush, you're nobody.
[03:27:52.400 --> 03:27:55.400]  It's one big club and you ain't in it.
[03:27:55.400 --> 03:27:59.400]  I'm Nancy Pelosi, don't you know who my daddy was?
[03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:04.400]  Yes. One big club and you ain't in it.
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:11.200]  Gavin Newsom. My dad, he was a big lawyer for the Getty Boys.
[03:28:11.200 --> 03:28:14.200]  Look at that little, look at the clown head he got on there.
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:16.200]  He got phony hair on there.
[03:28:17.300 --> 03:28:23.300]  Biden got implants on his head, too, and I think they went into his brain.
[03:28:23.300 --> 03:28:27.300]  They went too deep with the implant.
[03:28:27.300 --> 03:28:30.300]  They deplanted his brain.
[03:28:30.300 --> 03:28:34.300]  We got a freak show in front of us.
[03:28:34.300 --> 03:28:39.300]  And InfoWars is doing all they can to change this around, and so am I.
[03:28:39.300 --> 03:28:41.300]  So support those who support you.
[03:28:41.300 --> 03:28:46.300]  Because if you're not doing anything, it's over.

[03:28:55.300 --> 03:29:02.300]  A lot of people have asked me, why is InfoWars Store and InfoWars Life not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[03:29:02.300 --> 03:29:03.300]  And the answer is simple.

[03:29:11.300 --> 03:29:16.300]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[03:29:16.300 --> 03:29:22.300]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.

[03:30:34.300 --> 03:30:37.300]  Got to stay up until midnight working, doing a radio interview or something.
[03:30:37.300 --> 03:30:40.300]  And boom, writing an article or writing a book.
[03:30:40.300 --> 03:30:43.300]  And then I get two, three hours of energy and then you go right to bed after it.

[03:34:44.100 --> 03:34:50.100]  And you're helping to fund InfoWars, the independent media, and yourself.

[03:35:32.100 --> 03:35:37.100]  They're censoring us. Everywhere you go, you're censored. Everywhere.
[03:35:37.100 --> 03:35:43.100]  Anything that you say is not the crap spewing out of their mouths, it's misinformation.
[03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:55.100]  So support InfoWars, go to InfoWarsStores.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and get these specials today.
[03:35:55.100 --> 03:36:04.100]  Again, Alex was talking about all the things that they're doing to us and how they're killing us in so many ways.
[03:36:04.100 --> 03:36:10.100]  This is an article from the Toilet Paper Record, the New York Times, last week.
[03:36:10.100 --> 03:36:14.100]  Suicide risk of transgender people is documented.
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:30.400]  Transgender people in Denmark have a significantly higher risk of suicide than other groups according to an exhaustive analysis of health and legal records.
[03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:41.400]  Transgender people in the country had 77... I can't... I don't want to get this wrong. It's either 7.7 or 70...
[03:36:41.400 --> 03:36:56.400]  7.7, I believe, times, yeah, the rate of suicide attempts and 3.5 times the rate of suicide deaths compared with the rest of the population.
[03:36:56.400 --> 03:37:02.400]  Can't understand why. Can't figure it out.
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:12.400]  Nearly half of Americans have gained 17 pounds because of stress.
[03:37:12.400 --> 03:37:15.400]  This is a new poll that just came out.
[03:37:15.700 --> 03:37:28.620]  Yeah, there she is, Lola, look at Lola, look at that, and Lola telling me, this Rachel Levin,
[03:37:28.620 --> 03:37:35.540]  look at this, telling me about health, telling me about health, what are you talking to?
[03:37:35.540 --> 03:37:41.940]  Again, it's a clown show, and look at the guy back there doing, yeah, here we go, America,
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:42.700]  that's what it looks like.
[03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:51.500]  Yep, but don't worry about it, don't work out, don't eat good food, just take those
[03:37:51.500 --> 03:38:01.720]  very expensive drugs with all the side effects, you'll do great.
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:07.840]  Cancer rates are climbing among young people, Alex Jones was talking about this, and again
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:12.679]  a lot of the products, you try to get healthy, I mean I pray everyday the first thing I ask
[03:38:12.679 --> 03:38:20.599]  from God and my parents and relatives and all the spirits is to keep me healthy, that's
[03:38:20.599 --> 03:38:22.599]  number one.
[03:38:22.599 --> 03:38:27.279]  You think I want to work out, everyday I try to talk myself out of it, and I do it, work
[03:38:27.279 --> 03:38:31.859]  out, try to eat healthy as I can.
[03:38:31.859 --> 03:38:35.320]  Cancer rates are climbing among young people, it's not clear why, that's the beginning of
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:37.720]  the article, right?
[03:38:37.720 --> 03:38:43.359]  You keep reading, there we go, you ready?
[03:38:43.359 --> 03:38:51.140]  The main suspect researchers point to is obesity, which has climbed steadily since the 1960s
[03:38:51.140 --> 03:38:58.199]  and become more common in childhood and adolescence, you mean it wasn't always blimpitis?
[03:38:58.199 --> 03:39:00.560]  It wasn't people eating crap food?
[03:39:00.560 --> 03:39:03.160]  Oh, we used to call it junk food?
[03:39:03.200 --> 03:39:11.600]  The mothers aren't cooking for their kids anymore, they're letting strangers feed them
[03:39:11.600 --> 03:39:12.600]  crap.
[03:39:12.600 --> 03:39:16.600]  I got to go to work.
[03:39:16.600 --> 03:39:21.360]  Back in the 1960s, women were raising their kids.
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:24.440]  You look at my generation, go to the pictures of Woodstock.
[03:39:24.500 --> 03:39:33.500]  Obesity, it closed down the Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus.
[03:39:35.100 --> 03:39:41.100]  You don't have to pay to see the fat man and the tattooed lady.
[03:39:41.100 --> 03:39:44.100]  You're all over the place.
[03:39:44.100 --> 03:39:49.100]  It's the decline of this country.
[03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:55.760]  The same thing would happen with the COVID war.
[03:39:55.760 --> 03:40:01.520]  People dying of the virus had, what, 2.3 or 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[03:40:01.600 --> 03:40:10.200]  Sixty-one percent of the one-to-seventeen-year-olds
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:20.440]  that were hospitalized for COVID, according to the CDC, were obese.
[03:40:20.500 --> 03:40:29.340]  This country's gone down in front of our eyes.
[03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:39.260]  Joan Collins says Hollywood parties boring, now only four actors still have it.
[03:40:39.260 --> 03:40:44.940]  She reckons Hollywood's not what it used to be, as she reveals which actors she admires
[03:40:44.940 --> 03:40:50.480]  after working in the film industry for more than 70 years.
[03:40:50.480 --> 03:40:55.040]  Hollywood parties are dull now, it goes on and on.
[03:40:55.700 --> 03:40:57.700]  Yeah, it's a joke.
[03:40:57.700 --> 03:40:59.700]  It's one big club that runs the show.
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:01.700]  A bunch of little freaks.
[03:41:01.700 --> 03:41:03.700]  Look at the crap they put out there.
[03:41:03.700 --> 03:41:05.700]  And then this one.
[03:41:05.700 --> 03:41:07.700]  This one gave me a laugh.
[03:41:06.800 --> 03:41:20.800]  Bow Wow calls on hip-hop industry to stop releasing trash music. Bow Wow! Bow Wow! Bow Wow! Bow Wow! Rap!
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:35.340]  Hip-hop? Hey, all the jive is gone, all the jive is gone, but once upon a time you had
[03:41:35.340 --> 03:41:44.500]  these cats, white and black, playing hot and fine, bringing you real music. Now it's
[03:41:44.500 --> 03:42:00.860]  synthesized crap. Hip-hop, rap, from ragtime, to swing, to R&B, to rock and roll, to Motown,
[03:42:00.860 --> 03:42:03.140]  now it's No Town.
[03:42:03.300 --> 03:42:10.300]  Yep, hip hop, hip hop.
[03:42:10.300 --> 03:42:16.420]  The only way I see America coming back is to have a renaissance, to bring back the true
[03:42:16.420 --> 03:42:21.480]  meaning of the human spirit, and art is one of them.
[03:42:21.480 --> 03:42:22.699]  And we've lost it.
[03:42:22.699 --> 03:42:23.859]  Oh, wait a minute.
[03:42:23.859 --> 03:42:24.859]  What am I saying?
[03:42:24.859 --> 03:42:26.660]  How stupid could I be?
[03:42:26.660 --> 03:42:28.840]  How stupid could I be?
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:36.039]  You could buy Biden-Hunter's art for half a million dollars.
[03:42:36.039 --> 03:42:39.039]  That's how low it's gone.
[03:42:39.039 --> 03:42:50.439]  Yep, the drug addicts are, whoop, I better be careful, they may kill me.
[03:42:50.439 --> 03:42:57.080]  1776, bring back the spirit, InfoWars is.
[03:42:57.080 --> 03:43:03.759]  Just ended three-plus years of U.N. worldwide lockdowns and restrictions, and forced injections.
[03:43:03.759 --> 03:43:09.480]  Russia and Ukraine have been battling in a NATO-Russia proxy war for the last year and
[03:43:09.480 --> 03:43:10.480]  a half.
[03:43:10.480 --> 03:43:15.160]  Islamists have started burning down large parts of cities across Europe.
[03:43:15.160 --> 03:43:18.359]  The U.S. border has completely collapsed.
[03:43:18.359 --> 03:43:22.359]  Millions and millions are coming across here, many of them kidnapped children.
[03:43:22.359 --> 03:43:25.279]  Fentanyl deaths are over 100,000 a year.
[03:43:25.279 --> 03:43:27.679]  GMO products are being forced from the public.
[03:43:27.679 --> 03:43:31.679]  5G is being erected in every major industrialized country.
[03:43:31.679 --> 03:43:33.679]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[03:43:33.679 --> 03:43:36.679]  Heart attacks, strokes, neurological disorders.
[03:43:36.679 --> 03:43:39.679]  Now 25-year-olds are, quote, getting Alzheimer's.
[03:43:39.679 --> 03:43:46.679]  Inside the mRNA injections are the programming for spike protein of the HIV delivery system
[03:43:46.679 --> 03:43:47.679]  growing in our brains.
[03:43:47.679 --> 03:43:51.679]  And that's just the start of the new world order, the transgender cults chopping the
[03:43:51.679 --> 03:43:54.279]  penises and breasts off of millions of children.
[03:43:54.279 --> 03:43:56.279]  But we're fighting it at Infowars.com.
[03:44:25.279 --> 03:44:28.279]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[03:44:28.279 --> 03:44:31.279]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[03:44:31.279 --> 03:44:33.279]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[03:44:33.279 --> 03:44:36.279]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[03:44:36.279 --> 03:44:40.279]  We sell the very best, highest-grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[03:44:40.279 --> 03:44:41.279]  leading competitor.
[03:44:41.279 --> 03:44:46.279]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[03:44:46.279 --> 03:44:48.279]  You should also filter your shower water.
[03:44:48.279 --> 03:44:50.279]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[03:44:50.279 --> 03:44:51.279]  But I'm done talking about that.
[03:44:51.279 --> 03:44:54.279]  The point is you can get the filters at Infowars.com.
[03:44:54.279 --> 03:44:55.279]  They're discounted right now.
[03:44:55.279 --> 03:44:56.279]  Finally back in stock.
[03:44:56.279 --> 03:45:02.279]  We just ended three-plus years of U.N. worldwide lockdowns and restrictions and forced injections.
[03:45:02.279 --> 03:45:09.279]  Russia and Ukraine have been battling in a NATO-Russia proxy war the last year and a half.
[03:45:09.279 --> 03:45:14.279]  Islamists have started burning down large parts of cities across Europe.
[03:45:14.279 --> 03:45:17.279]  The U.S. border has completely collapsed.
[03:45:17.279 --> 03:45:19.279]  Millions and millions are coming across here.
[03:45:20.279 --> 03:45:22.279]  Many of them kidnap children.
[03:45:22.279 --> 03:45:24.279]  Fentanyl deaths for over 100,000 a year.
[03:45:24.279 --> 03:45:27.279]  GMO products are being forced on the public.
[03:45:27.279 --> 03:45:31.279]  5G is being erected in every major industrialized country.
[03:45:31.279 --> 03:45:33.279]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[03:45:33.279 --> 03:45:36.279]  Heart attacks, strokes, neurological disorders.
[03:45:36.279 --> 03:45:39.279]  Now 25-year-olds are, quote, getting Alzheimer's.
[03:45:39.279 --> 03:45:46.279]  Inside the mRNA injections are the programming for spike protein of the HIV delivery system
[03:45:46.279 --> 03:45:47.279]  growing in our brains.
[03:45:47.279 --> 03:45:49.279]  And that's just the start of the new war.
[03:45:49.279 --> 03:45:53.279]  The transgender cult's chopping the penises and breasts off of millions of children.
[03:45:53.279 --> 03:45:56.279]  But we're fighting it at Infowars.com.
[03:45:56.279 --> 03:46:02.279]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at Infowars.com.
[03:46:02.279 --> 03:46:05.279]  And they're both 50% off.
[03:46:05.279 --> 03:46:09.279]  We haven't offered these for 50% off since last Christmas.
[03:46:09.279 --> 03:46:11.279]  These are amazing products.
[03:46:11.279 --> 03:46:13.279]  And for those of you on the fence, I want you to try them.
[03:46:13.279 --> 03:46:18.279]  BrainForce Ultra hits in 15 minutes, only lasts 3 hours, with no hangover.
[03:46:18.279 --> 03:46:19.279]  It is a game changer.
[03:46:19.279 --> 03:46:21.279]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[03:46:21.279 --> 03:46:25.279]  Then our BrainForce Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[03:46:25.279 --> 03:46:30.279]  It gives you 4 to 6 hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[03:46:30.279 --> 03:46:34.279]  Both products back in stock, Infowars.com, for 50% off.
[03:46:34.279 --> 03:46:36.279]  And it funds the Infowar.
[03:46:36.279 --> 03:46:42.279]  So get your BrainForce Ultra, your BrainForce Plus, and your TurboForce all exclusively at Infowars.com.
[03:46:42.279 --> 03:46:47.279]  And know, you're funding the second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[03:46:47.279 --> 03:46:51.279]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:46:51.279 --> 03:46:54.279]  And the answer for energy is BrainForce.
[03:46:57.279 --> 03:47:02.279]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:02.279 --> 03:47:04.279]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:05.800 --> 03:47:21.800]  Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Celente.
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:25.800]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:31.800]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:37.800]  And again, it's Independence Day.
[03:47:37.800 --> 03:47:39.800]  It's Independence Day, coming up.
[03:47:39.800 --> 03:47:43.800]  No independence, no independence allowed.
[03:47:43.800 --> 03:47:45.800]  You gotta swallow my crap.
[03:47:45.800 --> 03:47:52.800]  I'm ABC, I'm CNN, I'm NPR, I'm FUC, you know what, yeah.
[03:47:52.800 --> 03:47:55.800]  Independence, you're getting independence from Infowars.
[03:47:55.800 --> 03:47:58.800]  So again, do what you can to support them.
[03:47:58.800 --> 03:48:03.800]  And if you want to read history before it happens, the Trends Journal.
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:07.800]  And if you want to tell the politicians how you feel, hey politicians,
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:09.800]  who the F are you to tell me what to do?
[03:48:09.800 --> 03:48:14.800]  You go to TrendsJournal.com and go to store and you get the shirt.
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:16.800]  I wear it all over.
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:19.800]  I mentioned before about the stupidity.
[03:48:20.100 --> 03:48:31.660]  Where to find food and water that's safe to eat in the event of a nuclear apocalypse?
[03:48:31.660 --> 03:48:35.260]  This is from June 16th, Business Insider.
[03:48:36.300 --> 03:48:41.300]  Whether it's from a nuclear war between nations or nuclear power plant,
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:46.300]  the risk of radiation raining from the skies is more
[03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:51.300]  real than it has been in generations. What am I, six years old? Are you writing?
[03:48:51.300 --> 03:48:56.300]  Apocalypse? You care what you're eating? Oh,
[03:48:56.300 --> 03:49:01.300]  and make sure you take the stuff out of the refrigerator. What refrigerator? There's no electricity anymore.
[03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:06.300]  Who wants to live after a nuclear apocalypse?
[03:49:06.300 --> 03:49:11.300]  Look how they sucked the Jew out of life with the COVID war. Imagine apocalypse.
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:16.300]  Anyway, this is the stupidity that they're selling. And Infowars and us are giving you
[03:49:16.300 --> 03:49:21.300]  the truth and trends. White House hails Bidenomics
[03:49:21.300 --> 03:49:26.300]  in an effort to woo skeptical voters. Yeah, there you go. Look, look at this.
[03:49:26.300 --> 03:49:29.300]  Look, I'm not making this up.
[03:49:29.900 --> 03:49:34.900]  Nuclear apocalypse? They're taking us into nuclear war.
[03:49:34.900 --> 03:49:37.900]  World War II is not ancient history.
[03:49:37.900 --> 03:49:39.900]  World War I is not ancient history.
[03:49:39.900 --> 03:49:41.900]  Europe destroyed.
[03:49:41.900 --> 03:49:47.900]  Millions and millions, 27 million, 25 million Russians killed.
[03:49:47.900 --> 03:49:55.900]  Radiation in fresh eggs can be detected up to five months after the nuclear disaster research shows.
[03:49:56.900 --> 03:50:03.900]  Food and water can be tricky to find in the aftermath of a nuclear attack or plant meltdown.
[03:50:03.900 --> 03:50:12.900]  In such an event, stick to foods stored inside fridges, cabinets, and other sealed containers.
[03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:15.900]  Look at the stupidity of this.
[03:50:15.900 --> 03:50:18.900]  They're preparing us for nuclear war.
[03:50:19.800 --> 03:50:25.800]  Again, I launched Occupy Peace. I put my money where my heart and where my mouth is.
[03:50:25.800 --> 03:50:28.800]  So do what you want to support it too.
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:33.800]  I'm trying to get a big rally going up here in Kingston in October.
[03:50:33.800 --> 03:50:38.800]  I can't tell you more about it, but, yep.
[03:50:39.000 --> 03:50:50.280]  Look at this, in a nuclear apocalyptic, securing food and water is going to be, bend over and
[03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:52.440]  kiss your butt goodbye.
[03:50:52.440 --> 03:51:05.720]  Yeah, anyway, they're talking about Bidenomics now, so to woo supporters, Bidenomics, how
[03:51:05.720 --> 03:51:12.480]  about moronics, Biden moronics, we're seeing shovels in the ground, we're seeing private
[03:51:12.480 --> 03:51:17.880]  investment come back to our country, no we're not, you know where they're bringing the jobs
[03:51:17.880 --> 03:51:18.880]  to?
[03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:23.640]  They're bringing it to Mexico, that's right, they're taking them out of China and bringing
[03:51:23.640 --> 03:51:27.880]  them to Mexico, more than the United States.
[03:51:28.900 --> 03:51:32.900]  So, I want to talk about this because I'm going to wrap up with the economy.
[03:51:32.900 --> 03:51:34.900]  We're talking about consumer spending.
[03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:41.100]  Group.
[03:51:41.700 --> 03:51:44.700]  The Fed's preferred inflation rate blah blah blah.
[03:51:44.700 --> 03:51:50.700]  Expenditure price increases rose 3.8% from a year earlier, its lowest reading in two years.
[03:51:50.700 --> 03:51:54.700]  Household spending rose 0.1% in May.
[03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:56.700]  No, it didn't.
[03:51:56.700 --> 03:51:58.700]  Yes, it did.
[03:51:58.700 --> 03:52:02.700]  But if household spending rose 0.1%
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:07.700]  and the Consumer Expenditures Index rose 3.8%,
[03:52:07.700 --> 03:52:13.700]  it's negative business opportunity.
[03:52:13.700 --> 03:52:15.700]  Look at this crap.
[03:52:15.700 --> 03:52:18.700]  I don't think Biden's going to run.
[03:52:18.700 --> 03:52:23.700]  And my forecast is RFK Jr. for president.
[03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:27.700]  And he's not a long shot at all because when you look at the polls,
[03:52:27.700 --> 03:52:29.700]  yeah, the polls show that Trump would beat Biden.
[03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:33.700]  But then when you look at other polls, the people don't want either of them.
[03:52:33.700 --> 03:52:38.700]  And young people are not going to vote for, according to the polls,
[03:52:38.700 --> 03:52:41.700]  young Democrats don't want to vote for Biden.
[03:52:41.700 --> 03:52:43.700]  I don't think he's going to be around.
[03:52:43.700 --> 03:52:47.700]  And I think try to bring that Godstone Gavin Newsom in.
[03:52:47.700 --> 03:52:51.700]  And I really think RFK Jr. has a,
[03:52:51.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  I think he's going to be the next president of the United States, minus the oil card.
[03:52:55.000 --> 03:53:03.200]  So, all this Bidenomics is moronics, it's Biden moronics, because the people, you're seeing
[03:53:03.200 --> 03:53:10.320]  the numbers coming out, 64%, you know, living, you know, paycheck to paycheck.
[03:53:10.320 --> 03:53:16.760]  People in urban areas going down really hard, crime on the rise, drug addiction, and the
[03:53:16.760 --> 03:53:18.520]  Ukraine war.
[03:53:18.520 --> 03:53:21.240]  But again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:53:21.240 --> 03:53:30.280]  I mentioned 9-11 preceded, it was the dot-com bust, which by the way, I had forecast in
[03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:40.840]  the Trends Journal back in October 1999, dot-com this, dot-com overload will short-circuit
[03:53:40.840 --> 03:53:46.560]  many high expectations for huge profits in internet commerce, when in detail, saying
[03:53:46.560 --> 03:53:51.560]  how it was going to crash out, and it did.
[03:53:51.560 --> 03:53:59.080]  But then the war on terror, whoop, here we go, 58% of Americans are living paycheck to
[03:53:59.080 --> 03:54:01.840]  paycheck, isn't that wonderful?
[03:54:01.840 --> 03:54:07.880]  But don't worry about it, when they launched the COVID war, the billionaires only got $27
[03:54:07.880 --> 03:54:12.200]  trillion richer, so shut your mouth.
[03:54:12.200 --> 03:54:14.880]  Here we are, plantation workers of slavelandia.
[03:54:15.900 --> 03:54:19.900]  So going back, what followed the great depression?
[03:54:19.900 --> 03:54:20.900]  World War II.
[03:54:20.900 --> 03:54:25.900]  And China's going down.
[03:54:25.900 --> 03:54:29.180]  China's economic recovery is still shaky.
[03:54:29.180 --> 03:54:33.260]  We're writing about it in detail in the Trends Journal.
[03:54:33.260 --> 03:54:37.220]  Their Purchasing Managers Index, which is a big one, down.
[03:54:37.220 --> 03:54:38.220]  Exports down.
[03:54:38.220 --> 03:54:40.300]  So here's the story.
[03:54:40.300 --> 03:54:42.380]  It's summertime.
[03:54:42.380 --> 03:54:48.340]  People are going to be traveling all over, all over the country, all over the world in
[03:54:48.340 --> 03:54:51.420]  the hemisphere where it's summer.
[03:54:51.420 --> 03:54:53.660]  Europe, it's going to be a big, big travel season.
[03:54:54.700 --> 03:54:56.700]  Yep.
[03:54:56.700 --> 03:54:59.700]  Look at the clowns. Look at these clowns.
[03:54:59.700 --> 03:55:01.700]  So.
[03:55:00.900 --> 03:55:08.900]  What's going to happen is the economy is going to look okay during the next couple of months.
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  And then when autumn sets in, and people get out of that summer state of mind,
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:23.000]  and you start looking at the real data, if they raise interest rates two more times like they say,
[03:55:23.800 --> 03:55:26.519]  this thing is going to collapse big.
[03:55:26.519 --> 03:55:28.119]  What they're hardly talking about,
[03:55:28.119 --> 03:55:31.119]  we forecasted this three years ago in the Trends Journal,
[03:55:31.119 --> 03:55:34.880]  an office building bust, and this is global.
[03:55:34.880 --> 03:55:41.119]  HSBC just moved out of Canary Wharf over there in the K,
[03:55:41.119 --> 03:55:43.359]  the FU something K,
[03:55:43.359 --> 03:55:47.119]  but anyway, little clowns running that show.
[03:55:47.119 --> 03:55:52.000]  Your office occupancy rate in the United States is about 50 percent.
[03:55:52.400 --> 03:55:55.400]  As interest rates go up, their floating loans go higher
[03:55:55.400 --> 03:55:58.800]  and they have less tenants, a lot less tenants.
[03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:01.599]  You have office vacancy rates with a V,
[03:56:01.599 --> 03:56:06.199]  empty, 20 percent in New York City,
[03:56:06.199 --> 03:56:10.199]  30 percent in San Francisco and L.A.
[03:56:10.199 --> 03:56:12.800]  They're going to be hitting 25 percent up here in Toronto.
[03:56:12.900 --> 03:56:22.660]  The banks are going to collapse and then you're going to hear a story like this, we interrupt
[03:56:22.660 --> 03:56:29.460]  this program to bring you a special message, the Russians hacked our banking system.
[03:56:29.460 --> 03:56:37.980]  Don't worry about it, hey, take it easy, yeah, there's America, take it easy.
[03:56:37.980 --> 03:56:40.100]  Step right up, step right up.
[03:56:40.580 --> 03:56:46.020]  Anyway, we're coming out with a digital currency, don't worry about it, it's going to replace the
[03:56:46.020 --> 03:56:51.619]  dollar, it'll be fine. Yeah, they're going to come out with digital trash.
[03:56:52.800 --> 03:56:55.800]  Get rid of that dirty cash.
[03:56:55.800 --> 03:56:59.300]  And that's why I still believe in gold.
[03:56:59.300 --> 03:57:03.800]  The lower they lower interest rates to bring a heart and more they bring
[03:57:03.800 --> 03:57:07.800]  them down the week of the dollars going to get the week of the dollar
[03:57:07.800 --> 03:57:09.800]  gets the higher gold prices go up.
[03:57:09.800 --> 03:57:15.300]  The only reason the dollar strong is because of a high interest rate.
[03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:23.300]  So, they're going to lower interest rates before the presidential reality show.
[03:57:23.300 --> 03:57:25.300]  They do it all the time.
[03:57:25.300 --> 03:57:28.300]  So, that's where we're at.
[03:57:28.300 --> 03:57:31.300]  Stay tuned to Infowars.

[03:57:59.300 --> 03:58:01.300]  that we face in the world today.
[03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:05.300]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023.

[03:58:46.300 --> 03:58:51.300]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker Carlson
[03:58:51.300 --> 03:58:52.300]  and take him off the air.
[03:58:52.300 --> 03:58:55.300]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[03:58:55.300 --> 03:58:57.300]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[03:58:57.300 --> 03:59:00.300]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[03:59:00.300 --> 03:59:03.300]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[03:59:03.300 --> 03:59:05.300]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:59:05.300 --> 03:59:12.300]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan.
[03:59:12.300 --> 03:59:15.300]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
