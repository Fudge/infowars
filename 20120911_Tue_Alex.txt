[00:00.000 --> 00:13.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.560 --> 00:36.840]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:36.840 --> 00:45.400]  we are live and here we are 11 years after the stage terror attacks of 9-11 that we're
[00:45.400 --> 00:51.440]  meant to bring a new dark age of tyranny over the western world and then the rest of
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.920]  the planet.
[00:53.920 --> 01:02.040]  Staged false flag event 110% and I'm going to be reviewing some of the smoking guns of
[01:02.040 --> 01:07.720]  9-11 today here and I'm going to open the phones up in the first hour and try to actually
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.560]  go to your calls early in the first hour specifically on 9-11.
[01:13.560 --> 01:19.000]  Now we have to define what an inside job means there is no doubt that's even the cover of
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.040]  the New York Post you know Bush knew that the government knew and ordered the FBI and others
[01:25.040 --> 01:30.200]  to stand down but then as you research it deeper you find out that they found magic
[01:30.200 --> 01:35.120]  passports that they hadn't really found there was frame-up evidence they announced building
[01:35.120 --> 01:40.760]  seven had fallen into its own footprint at freefall an hour before it fell on three different
[01:40.760 --> 01:48.080]  news channels CNN then to BBC and then BBC said that's not real footage we're like courts
[01:48.080 --> 01:53.400]  is real footage and then later they admitted that indeed it was their footage and then
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.600]  I predicted it was Reuters had sent them an internal feed because they have to get out
[01:58.600 --> 02:03.080]  ahead of a story like why is this building about to fall and it turned out two years
[02:03.080 --> 02:08.480]  after we first exposed that they're like oh yeah it was a Reuters internal feed because
[02:08.480 --> 02:15.320]  I went and researched that BBC gets internal feeds mainly from Reuters Thompson Reuters
[02:15.320 --> 02:22.360]  and so that's where it was fed you want to know who did 9-11 find out who told the people
[02:22.360 --> 02:27.160]  at Reuters that information kind of like before Lee Harvey Oswald's name was even in the news
[02:27.160 --> 02:34.600]  where he was arrested in Dallas back in 1963 Colonel Fletcher Proudy the head of Black
[02:34.600 --> 02:38.240]  Ops who'd been sent out of the country he'd been sent to Antarctica he was coming back
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.200]  through Australia in areas and sees the newspaper with Lee Harvey Oswald you know back in the
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.800]  old days newspapers came out sometimes 10 times a day in major cities it was like television
[02:47.800 --> 02:53.000]  at the time and there was a you know extra extra read all about it Lee Harvey Oswald
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.600]  kills JFK president of the United States dead and then he goes and checks time zones when
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.240]  he gets back and it wasn't even in the news yet wasn't in the US news for hours so they
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.880]  get caught screwing this stuff up just like they got caught running drills of the exact
[03:07.880 --> 03:16.120]  same bus exact same trains at the exact same time being bombed by the exact same jihadis
[03:16.120 --> 03:23.880]  on 77 in London so this stuff comes out they get caught now are we saying the whole government
[03:23.880 --> 03:28.920]  did this no compartmentalized criminal groups and we've got a pretty clear image of exactly
[03:28.920 --> 03:36.840]  what they did on 9-11 and then now 11 years hence no one can deny that this was used to
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.360]  destroy liberty shadow of a police state that they now say is not pointed at Darling al-Qaeda
[03:42.360 --> 03:47.640]  as the CFR said a month and a half ago they said quote we need al-Qaeda they're good and
[03:47.640 --> 03:53.240]  it's all over the news like I just saw one of the headlines here at info wars.com while I was
[03:53.240 --> 04:02.040]  just talking every day mainstream news LA Times Reuters you name it is like yeah they're using
[04:02.040 --> 04:08.120]  al-Qaeda to attack Syria in fact I saw a CNN report early this morning when I got about 5 a.m
[04:08.120 --> 04:18.840]  and it was al-Qaeda getting you know steam again al-Qaeda building itself up again now that it's
[04:18.840 --> 04:24.680]  got a foothold in Syria and Libya I mean the government wants to set up checkpoints of the
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.800]  highway saying there's terrorists everywhere and they gave 10,000 missiles to al-Qaeda in Libya
[04:31.080 --> 04:36.840]  2,000 of them each seeking a radar guided that means an aircrafts coming in or taking off it's
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.160]  got its radar on you fire that missile it goes right into the radar cone on that aircraft
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.120]  are you got a cruise ship coming in that's got radar right into the conning tower of it

[08:21.320 --> 08:38.920]  i'm reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time because at five o'clock they
[08:38.920 --> 08:52.920]  take me to the gallows the sands of time the sands of time for me are running
[08:55.640 --> 09:01.320]  the sands of time for all of us are running low death could come at any moment

[09:21.880 --> 09:26.840]  and slavery and domination and those who have a dream for humanity
[09:26.840 --> 09:41.240]  to travel to the stars it is 11 years after the tragic attacks of september 11th 2001
[09:42.440 --> 09:50.920]  it is september 11th 2012 and no one can deny regardless of what you think about those attacks
[09:50.920 --> 09:59.080]  that a they have been used to set up a modern east german style police state in the western world
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.240]  b that system is now being fully flipped onto domestic populations c we are being publicly
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.880]  told in every major publication including cfr.org council on foreign relations the real government
[10:15.880 --> 10:20.760]  in this country they write the reports that congress adopts that the executive adopts
[10:20.760 --> 10:29.320]  that al-qaeda is good and that we should work with al-qaeda in fact at about five a.m. this morning
[10:31.080 --> 10:39.560]  i actually i amd this cnn report at 5 11 a.m. as you can see here on my iphone
[10:40.760 --> 10:44.920]  if you guys give me a document cam shot i'll show people this looking at watching us on
[10:44.920 --> 10:53.720]  prisonplanet.tv on 9 11 al-qaeda looks to syria to revive its fortunes
[10:58.280 --> 11:00.440]  and then right in front of us
[11:03.240 --> 11:07.560]  like we're ignorant like we're stupid they tell us though
[11:07.560 --> 11:16.760]  that we have to continue to give up our liberties and give up our freedoms
[11:20.360 --> 11:27.960]  because al-qaeda is coming after us and they can only do this in a vacuum
[11:27.960 --> 11:42.200]  of reality being derelict this can only be done with a so-called informed population
[11:43.480 --> 11:51.480]  that is so disconnected from facts and common sense and logic i mean think about the magnitude of
[11:51.480 --> 12:03.720]  this 11 years after those spectacular theatrical blood-letting events that happened that was
[12:03.720 --> 12:10.680]  something out of a godzilla movie where he destroys tokyo but in living high death color
[12:10.680 --> 12:17.560]  and then replayed to us thousands of times and school children taught to hide under their desk
[12:17.560 --> 12:23.800]  because isama bin laden is coming to get them and as i pointed out at the time hey al-qaeda
[12:23.800 --> 12:29.240]  was created by the cia british intelligence israeli intelligence and pakistani intelligence
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.600]  and then i pointed out hey the times of london and even newsweek are admitting they'll admit so
[12:34.600 --> 12:42.440]  much but report it like it's no big deal that they flew tens of thousands of al-qaeda and taliban
[12:42.440 --> 12:50.040]  cream was one term they used in the news the leadership and and of course before 9 11 wouldn't
[12:50.040 --> 12:55.880]  let colonel schaefer kill bin laden when he was in drone sites not once but twice confirmed to be
[12:57.480 --> 13:03.560]  obl and then after they have the 9 11 attacks they
[13:03.560 --> 13:11.880]  send in the northern alliance and and al-al-qaeda goes and gets conscripts an average of 14 years
[13:11.880 --> 13:22.440]  of age digs them in outside kabool and other cities and then with the cia has a staged attack
[13:22.440 --> 13:28.680]  they even had a staged fake war where they then bombed all those trenches and killed all those
[13:28.680 --> 13:36.840]  teenagers killed all those kids while the real al-qaeda sat back living in hotels not even underground
[13:36.840 --> 13:43.240]  not being attacked and special forces this came out in the news at the time you can go back and
[13:43.240 --> 13:50.280]  look at late 2001 early 2002 during the quote invasion and takeover of afghanistan where generals
[13:50.280 --> 13:54.360]  even went public that's how we know people say well somebody would talk of this was going on they
[13:54.360 --> 13:59.320]  did they said look we're told to leave him alone we're told not to capture him when we did capture
[13:59.320 --> 14:04.760]  the head of the taliban their head general with al-qaeda we were told load him on c 130's fly him
[14:04.760 --> 14:11.720]  over the mountains to pakistan and give him big chest of gold there any question who these guys
[14:11.720 --> 14:19.240]  work for and i'm going times of london newsweek associated press reporting this it's not like
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.040]  it's some secret people are going to all shut up conspiracy theorist i'm like no no here it is
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.720]  it's not that the cia created al-qaeda and they got out of control they've always been
[14:31.720 --> 14:37.320]  under their control in 1979 when zabigniew brzezinski set it up you go see that movie charlie
[14:37.320 --> 14:45.240]  wilson's war whatever it's called it it says all that started in the mid 1980s no it didn't
[14:45.240 --> 14:50.840]  it didn't start in 1983 8045 it started in 79 brzezinski's written two books about it national
[14:50.840 --> 14:57.480]  security advisor the jimmy carter then they use the al-qaeda against the serbs in kosovo and when
[14:57.480 --> 15:02.040]  the serbs fought back they said all the serbs are killing civilians they went and carpet bombed it
[15:02.040 --> 15:09.720]  with du weaponry including bombing belgrade which is in the north blew up tv stations you name it
[15:09.720 --> 15:16.200]  you name it blew up their energy grid blew up their water grid and then gave the south to al-qaeda
[15:16.200 --> 15:23.320]  who are now on record this year this was rumors 10 years ago now it's in the news that whoever's left
[15:23.320 --> 15:30.040]  the christian serbs they round them up and cut them open and and have aircraft waiting un aircraft
[15:30.040 --> 15:38.120]  nearby pristina and they fly out with their organs just type in kla selling serve organs
[15:38.120 --> 15:47.640]  i mean you cannot make this stuff up you cannot make this stuff up and then they use al-qaeda
[15:47.640 --> 15:58.600]  again against russia in chechnya and other areas on record and now they've used al-qaeda against
[15:58.600 --> 16:04.040]  libya they're the main brigade the main leading force they were black uniforms with the al-qaeda
[16:04.040 --> 16:12.040]  patch it's it's on roiders it's bbc showing them brigades in black uniforms with their patches with
[16:12.040 --> 16:20.520]  their flags lining up christians in just machine gunning them and it's back of the paper oh look
[16:20.520 --> 16:26.040]  at our cute little al-qaeda what they're doing and i'm supposed to sit here and fly out of austin
[16:26.040 --> 16:31.720]  bergstrom airport and have the manager walk over go you're alex jones you're a troublemaker and
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.240]  i'm looking at some gray-haired guy a few months ago i mean i'm just grabbing ball head you know guy

[16:49.800 --> 16:54.760]  come on i mean your your bosses put the underwear bomber on the plane and he didn't want people
[16:54.760 --> 17:02.760]  here and he goes all right just just get out of here oh you don't want me to sit there and actually
[17:02.760 --> 17:08.760]  get back in your face i'm supposed to play this game that that bin laden's hiding in my underwear
[17:08.760 --> 17:18.520]  when the u.s. government on record in congressional testimony admits the undersecretary of state
[17:18.520 --> 17:28.200]  mr. kennedy testified song song youtube it's on c span dot org that the u.s. agency ordered the
[17:28.200 --> 17:33.480]  the state department to get him on the aircraft without a passport exactly what our witness lawyer
[17:34.360 --> 17:40.600]  now he's won the primary for congress in michigan what our witness shed a month and a half before it
[17:40.600 --> 17:50.040]  was admitted came out in congress okay i listen i'm not playing the game with you anymore okay
[17:51.400 --> 17:57.480]  they planted two passports on 9-11 that supposedly survived the fireball norad did stand down there
[17:57.480 --> 18:02.280]  was a drill of the same targets being hit just like 7-7 in london they had a drill the same
[18:02.280 --> 18:06.600]  targets being at the same time so that the rest of the agencies pick up the chatter they're told
[18:06.600 --> 18:12.360]  it's just a drill if your operatives get caught doing it you say it's a drill i mean you fund
[18:12.360 --> 18:20.280]  the attack through the drill this is all a playbook and i have to sit here and watch people go along
[18:20.280 --> 18:31.080]  with it so so what is what is the point of sitting here and going through the hundreds of smoking
[18:31.080 --> 18:36.920]  guns i can cover today i mean i'll go through some of the top 20 or so and get into a bunch of other
[18:36.920 --> 18:43.960]  news but the issue is i told you 11 years ago this would be used to go after libertarians
[18:43.960 --> 18:50.680]  conservatives constitutionalist anti-globalist because that was already what all the manuals
[18:50.680 --> 18:56.040]  were for we'd already broken all the ones under clinton we had the current ones bush was continuing
[18:56.040 --> 19:03.320]  it we knew then a year into the attacks by 2002 we got the manuals of what they were teaching
[19:03.320 --> 19:10.520]  infregard and all these citizens spy course and it was none of it was about al qaeda it was all
[19:11.160 --> 19:14.840]  because people were getting mad at these meetings a lot of them were anti-muslim folks that really
[19:14.840 --> 19:18.520]  wanted to buy into the narrative they go and they're learning how conservative libertarians
[19:18.520 --> 19:22.920]  are going to blow up federal buildings and how and how the founding fathers are bad and all this
[19:22.920 --> 19:28.920]  and they're like what so that's why we got leaked all that information by police federal marshals
[19:28.920 --> 19:35.320]  fbi state police you name it good people you got a room of cops in there and tell them George
[19:35.320 --> 19:41.480]  washington's bad they're like you know what planet are you from so the point is that i knew this was
[19:41.480 --> 19:47.880]  going on behind the scenes now it's public so regardless of what happened on 9 11 it's being
[19:47.880 --> 19:55.000]  used to take our freedom by who not the government the government itself has been hijacked by foreign
[19:55.000 --> 19:58.920]  banks who have announced a world government i'll give you the number when we come back
[20:00.680 --> 20:05.560]  have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant

[24:16.120 --> 24:23.640]  why zawa hearing the devil in the sky zawa hearing here's an example of the total
[24:23.640 --> 24:31.400]  twilight zone i have now entered during that break i went back into the coffee room where we
[24:31.400 --> 24:39.400]  have a big television set on either fox cnn or cnbc and there was the brother of zawa hearing
[24:40.360 --> 24:45.400]  reportedly he was number one in al qaeda at one time they claim they killed they're always killing
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.760]  the same guy over and over again again why don't they just pick new boogeymen it's the practice
[24:50.760 --> 24:56.360]  getting away with incredible lies and they were on there with the cnn reporter and just so happened
[24:56.360 --> 25:00.920]  jacob shin had a feeling and was recording it because we have a dvd recorder in there
[25:00.920 --> 25:05.560]  and randomly record the news sometimes he was recording it so he thinks we have a tape of it
[25:06.520 --> 25:12.600]  and uh yeah yeah here it is here it is here it is that they just printed it i saw this three
[25:12.600 --> 25:17.160]  minutes uh three minutes ago ran around like a chicken with my head cut off and the guys just
[25:17.160 --> 25:25.160]  found it seeing in exclusive al qaeda's leader brother offers peace plan zawa hearing's brother
[25:26.520 --> 25:32.200]  i'm in there during the break and they are breaking the news i just can't handle this anymore
[25:32.200 --> 25:37.880]  that al qaeda is going to be our friend now ladies and gentlemen al qaeda always worked for the
[25:37.880 --> 25:43.240]  globalist america has been taken over by megabanks how are they going to get our liberties and get
[25:43.240 --> 25:49.080]  us to accept a police state say that a foreign shadowy group attacked us set up a police state
[25:49.080 --> 25:54.760]  and then flip it on to us which they've now done there's still time to turn this around
[25:54.760 --> 26:00.280]  and i'll never forget larry king live a week after 9 11 he had prince bandar known as bandar
[26:00.280 --> 26:07.640]  bush he's such friends with the bushes on and larry king was running down bin laden with some of
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.160]  bin laden and bringing up the fact that his family was allowed got to get larry king credit for that
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.520]  to leave the country when all their air traffic was shut down for three days they were allowed to
[26:16.520 --> 26:22.600]  fly out on 18 flights is also a local miami news they call that a conspiracy theory when i raised
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.960]  it even though it was on the news they counted on you not knowing how to find it and he was running
[26:27.960 --> 26:34.520]  down bin laden and bandar goes you did not speak of him this way he is hero in my country and this
[26:34.520 --> 26:39.400]  is the saudi arabian ambassador to the u.s larry king knows he's not supposed to run down saudi
[26:39.400 --> 26:44.360]  arabia that's one of the biggest owners of the media in this country at least investors not
[26:44.360 --> 26:53.320]  technically controllers but but be technical owners and he goes okay all right well tell us
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.320]  about bin laden and he goes into how great bin laden this somebody's got to dig that tape up i
[26:57.320 --> 27:05.640]  saw it the point is that that's how ridiculous all this is they got to make al qaeda the hero in
[27:05.640 --> 27:11.720]  the middle east set up bases everywhere and now is being used as a globalist invasion force to
[27:11.720 --> 27:18.200]  take over so in a weird way it's true when they say obama wants to have muslims take over it's
[27:18.200 --> 27:26.280]  actually true but it's it's it's not like all muslims or or he's a muslim in doing it a certain
[27:26.280 --> 27:32.600]  group out of saudi arabia not just sunnis but a tiny minority group that dominates the 80 percent
[27:32.600 --> 27:40.120]  of muslims that are suing the globalists make deals with the most powerful the chinese billion
[27:40.120 --> 27:45.000]  several hundred million they use them and slave labor to leverage out their competition and take
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.840]  over economically militarily they build up the united states as the enemy of the russians
[27:50.840 --> 27:56.840]  while the globalists actually funded both sides have the us be the physical muscle but the shock
[27:56.840 --> 28:04.200]  force arab legion brigade model and that's what the british set up in around 1900 or so right
[28:04.200 --> 28:10.840]  through 1920 they created saudi arabia and other areas they call it the arab legion the arab brigade
[28:12.440 --> 28:17.160]  and then hitler went in in the 40s and took over these groups and then cia after that
[28:17.160 --> 28:24.760]  that's who they used to overthrow mohammed mozadek in 43 in 53 uh in iran so and again i'm moving
[28:24.760 --> 28:28.840]  quicker i don't talk to you like you're an idiot and and hold up and i'll cut up up it and go
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.520]  this is the bad man and you and you what are you going to do i'm going to give my rights up that's
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.560]  right and what are you going to do let the tsa stick their hands down my pants i mean i don't
[28:39.560 --> 28:44.040]  talk to you like you're a five-year-old ladies and gentlemen look this isn't that hard to figure
[28:44.040 --> 28:52.280]  out if you're a new listener okay the british intelligence when it was the big empire created
[28:52.280 --> 29:00.440]  radical muslim sect of highly militarized vicious brave people some of the better ones in saudi
[29:00.440 --> 29:05.560]  arabia which wasn't even saudi arabia then they let them take over they've used them ever since
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.760]  it's very simple now they're getting ready to put al qaeda to bed and say they're good guys now
[29:10.760 --> 29:16.120]  in that fake war and start the new war where they let them take over all these major countries
[29:16.120 --> 29:21.240]  including the country surrounding russia and they're now going to be the good guys attacking
[29:21.240 --> 29:26.680]  russia and i'll be called a kami russia lover if i don't support al qaeda and so will you

[33:12.680 --> 33:18.920]  extension of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every dictator who was
[33:18.920 --> 33:23.880]  ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time
[33:24.680 --> 33:30.840]  it has refinements technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[33:30.840 --> 33:37.400]  of human freedom but like every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule
[33:37.400 --> 33:44.760]  logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[33:50.520 --> 34:00.920]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show we are live
[34:00.920 --> 34:07.160]  live how do you take a once free society with the bill of rights and constitution an example
[34:07.720 --> 34:16.040]  of liberty and freedom of the world how do you take that country and make it an example of
[34:16.040 --> 34:21.160]  tyranny for others to emulate well you blow up a bunch of buildings you have one plane hit so
[34:21.160 --> 34:26.120]  all the cameras aim at it then another one comes in then you blow up those buildings the command
[34:26.120 --> 34:32.280]  center the cia command base building seven 400 yards away that's where you're running the attacks
[34:32.280 --> 34:38.360]  from you blow it up and tell people fires did it falls into its own footprint but you screw up
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.240]  you announce it's falling in its own footprint an hour before and then again 25 minutes before and
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.720]  then the police say yeah we've been told they're going to blow it up get back and i heard it on
[34:47.720 --> 34:54.440]  mpr i heard it on cbs radio i told people about that for years and finally the news began as internet
[34:54.440 --> 35:02.360]  space got cheaper by 2005 2006 dumping all those old archives on and people found archive after
[35:02.360 --> 35:12.600]  archive on cbs npr cnn bbc of exactly what i said i heard that day while driving to get a pizza
[35:13.240 --> 35:18.280]  because i've been on air from you know 9 a.m or so that morning right through to about 4 30
[35:18.280 --> 35:24.120]  central 5 30 eastern i drove down to mr gatties or was it conans right down the street from my
[35:24.120 --> 35:30.520]  house it was conans pizza and i've been driving and i'm and i'm listening to cbs and they're saying
[35:30.520 --> 35:35.400]  yeah building seven solemn's brothers uh they don't want it to fall and damage to their buildings
[35:35.400 --> 35:41.000]  they're going to control demolition and so they can control its fault and by the time i go in get
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.480]  the pizza drive home five minutes and get in there like building seven has fallen it's falling in
[35:45.480 --> 35:51.320]  its own footprint from fires by itself and i'm like and so i ran back in because i was doing
[35:51.320 --> 35:55.640]  guest hosting and and commentary on all the shows on genesis right through to like two in the morning
[35:55.640 --> 36:01.880]  that night i ran in at about five o'clock nine times six o'clock you know cali uh a new york time
[36:03.960 --> 36:07.480]  about 30 months after they've wandered up and i was like did anybody hear that did
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.440]  anybody see that and callers are like yeah it was on our local news and then the cnn footage
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.400]  and others started coming out of the cops going get back they're going to bring it down boom boom
[36:17.400 --> 36:24.360]  boom and the blast squids i mean building seven really is the smoking gun and they said
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.760]  oh it didn't fall at freefall because physicists had said it's impossible with fire to have something
[36:28.760 --> 36:33.320]  fall freefall no buildings ever fallen from fire period or all you need to demolish one's a pick
[36:33.320 --> 36:39.880]  lighter and sure enough they've made them change the insurance actuaries now nationwide to say well
[36:39.880 --> 36:45.240]  now fire can bring down buildings now they've had literally more than 50 big skyscraper fires
[36:45.240 --> 36:50.840]  since then some that burned for a week you know 500 foot red hot flame white hot flame shooting out
[36:50.840 --> 36:58.840]  in china uh shooting out in brazil not even built to us standards nothing collapses but the ceilings
[36:58.840 --> 37:06.280]  and things none of the big steel structure even melts first they said it all melted and they said
[37:06.280 --> 37:10.760]  well that's impossible so it weakened well we've got the footage from tower one and two of white
[37:10.760 --> 37:16.920]  hot metal pouring out before they collapse like lava and we have the firefighters well we have the
[37:16.920 --> 37:27.480]  nasa uh aircraft photos six weeks after the temperature in the rubble was a thousand degrees
[37:27.480 --> 37:34.200]  above what jet fuel can burn at with an oxygen tank blasting on it you can have a
[37:34.200 --> 37:42.040]  set up to basically blacksmith injecting air in and you can't get it up to that
[37:42.920 --> 37:47.080]  they use some really high tech stuff we got the firefighters saying yeah we dug down in there
[37:47.080 --> 37:53.160]  weeks later and it was like lava pouring down and we have other clips of firefighters who went in
[37:53.160 --> 37:57.720]  there after the planes had hit their way down in the bottom and they're like there was like lava
[37:57.720 --> 38:10.040]  lava lava you're your big hot oak fire in your fireplace with that iron grate that melts a lot
[38:10.040 --> 38:17.720]  easier than steel coke steel and structural steel does it even get red very rarely maybe right on
[38:17.720 --> 38:23.320]  the edge where all the coals are at and when it does get red hot or white hot does it melt no it
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.840]  doesn't and they had the whistleblower inside underwriting laboratories go public
[38:30.040 --> 38:35.240]  mr ryan and say hey we did internal studies said it was impossible they told me not to go public
[38:35.240 --> 38:42.440]  with it i'm going public boom fired and then the the media spun it mr jones is saying firefighters
[38:42.440 --> 38:48.120]  blew up the towers and police no they were just told get back i've interviewed i've gone and found

[39:24.600 --> 39:34.360]  maps that were showing on screen up up to 3000 degrees up to six weeks later in the towers
[39:34.360 --> 39:44.120]  now are you going to buy into any of that ladies and gentlemen again and i told you they were going
[39:44.120 --> 39:49.560]  to use this thing our rights and now they admit they run al-qaeda we're not saying the fbi age

[39:53.960 --> 39:57.880]  we're not saying a bureaucrats involved we're not saying the congress people on average are involved
[39:57.880 --> 40:05.400]  bush didn't want to testify to congress under oath they had to have a closed session
[40:07.800 --> 40:11.400]  something like this a lot of evidence shows bush himself probably didn't even know
[40:14.520 --> 40:19.640]  criminal mole elements at the highest levels cheney one month before 9 11
[40:20.680 --> 40:24.920]  changed the 1957 norad parameters for the first and only time
[40:24.920 --> 40:32.600]  time stating and issuing the order it's public with the with the pentagon protection seal on it
[40:32.600 --> 40:40.040]  and everything that norad was to stand down during a hijack missile attack aircraft is a missile
[40:40.600 --> 40:45.720]  and that no one in norad had the power to shoot down aircraft anymore even though they'd always
[40:45.720 --> 40:54.120]  had that power as a one star general or admiral and above or they're designated on duty aircrafts
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.400]  coming into the city aircrafts coming to the base shoot it down there's that's a default position
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.600]  they had missiles on top the pentagon they don't want you to know about that that's on record
[41:04.600 --> 41:08.760]  they did drills that day that being hit to make everybody stand down they hit the area they were
[41:08.760 --> 41:15.480]  constructing on the aircraft did maneuvers that no pilot could do and and mainline fighter pilots
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.080]  and commercial pilots have gone public had to be computerized guided
[41:19.080 --> 41:27.000]  white hot flash everyone reported smelling cordyte i've interviewed witnesses that survived inside
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.040]  where the fbi came in and told him you didn't see this you didn't see that
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.520]  all of this is going on ladies and gentlemen
[41:38.680 --> 41:45.160]  and then cheney one week after 9 11 rescinded the order and gave the shootdown power back
[41:45.160 --> 41:51.000]  to the military the military we've when they finally released the 9 11 tapes you've got the f a a you

[43:56.360 --> 44:01.480]  sister back in missouri my dad knows you know the conversation i can't not talk about this stuff
[44:01.480 --> 44:05.800]  once you learn about it you have to talk about it um and i said all you got to do is go in and
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.960]  look at three pictures the picture of the pennsylvania field the picture of the pentagon and then a
[44:09.960 --> 44:16.040]  picture of a 737 crash somewhere else in the world i can't get him to even do that but those are
[44:16.040 --> 44:21.400]  those are my big smoking guns where i get started of course in every other big jet air crash it's
[44:21.400 --> 44:27.320]  over a mile or more there's people everywhere fuselage but we have even the police were on the
[44:27.320 --> 44:31.240]  scene go yeah we couldn't find anything it was a hole in the ground and the other state police said
[44:31.240 --> 44:39.000]  no we saw f-16s chasing it and they shot it down yeah where's the debris i even know gal here in
[44:39.000 --> 44:45.800]  noxville that used to be a airline stewardess flight attendant she she says she had a former flight
[44:45.800 --> 44:49.560]  attendant go down in that field and died in that crash and they won't they won't believe anything
[44:49.560 --> 44:53.720]  to try to tell them about it well you know i remember hearing this and not believing it on
[44:53.720 --> 45:00.280]  the day of 9 11 and then it came out in the local news that they landed another flight 93 and got
[45:00.280 --> 45:04.920]  everybody off at a nasa hangar what was that in pennsylvania i mean that's what i it was actually
[45:04.920 --> 45:10.040]  in the local news i i just man we're talking twilight zone and then you read operation northwood's
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.080]  the pentagon plan to hijack jets and fly them into things but by remote control and have the
[45:15.080 --> 45:21.960]  other jet with the same tail numbers land and have cia employees get off they wanted to use deep
[45:21.960 --> 45:28.360]  cover cia civilian employees that they had embedded in society this was in 63 they wanted to do this
[45:28.360 --> 45:32.840]  to claim they'd all died then sheep dip them and give them new identities just so they could say
[45:32.840 --> 45:39.640]  hey look real people died well you notice all those aircraft had right at 22 occupancy so they
[45:39.640 --> 45:45.240]  set it all up that day so they wouldn't have to fake the deaths of that many people i mean we
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.200]  pretty much know what they did i don't like to speculate but if you look at northwood's it's
[45:48.200 --> 45:53.400]  pretty clear what do you think about the magic passports not one but two surviving out of their
[45:53.400 --> 45:57.560]  clothing out of the fireball out of the building to six feet of dust and rubble on the ground
[45:57.560 --> 46:03.560]  and being found that day by the fbi do you believe that it's just it's ridiculous it's what it is
[46:03.560 --> 46:10.280]  they also found one at uh at uh shanksville pennsylvania yes i heard that too i hadn't heard
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.920]  about the 6000 degree temperatures those six weeks after that they're at the no no no no no no no
[46:14.920 --> 46:19.800]  it was it was more like 3000 which is about uh over a thousand degrees if you heard 6000 you
[46:19.800 --> 46:25.160]  misheard or i misspoke it was 3000 i misheard probably well hey that's all i want to say uh
[46:25.160 --> 46:31.000]  god bless you man thank you so much i appreciate you calling scott in idaho scott you're on the air
[46:32.440 --> 46:36.920]  hi alex how are you doing i'm doing all right even though my republics basically been
[46:36.920 --> 46:42.200]  sacrificed on the altar of the 9 11 hoax can you say ominous parallels
[46:43.320 --> 46:49.640]  yes ominous parallels to uh germany in 1939 i understand that you read the rise and fall of
[46:49.640 --> 46:54.760]  the third right you're talking about operation glywitz which is part of operation himmler that's
[46:54.760 --> 47:01.480]  right and you asked earlier what's the point in going all uh going over over all this um
[47:02.200 --> 47:09.160]  the point is uh the the gas chambers at oxwits and the adjoining crematoria viewed from a short
[47:09.160 --> 47:15.960]  distance weren't sinister looking places it was impossible uh to tell what they were over them
[47:15.960 --> 47:24.440]  were well kept lawns with flower borders signs that the entrances that simply said bass the unsuspecting
[47:24.440 --> 47:30.200]  prisoners thought they were simply being taken to the bath for the delousing which was customary
[47:30.200 --> 47:34.840]  at all camps well it was the same thing in the soviet camps that the nazis model a lot of it off of
[47:35.640 --> 47:40.360]  they were really prisoner of war camps which were modeled off of the reservations here which were
[47:40.360 --> 47:44.840]  prisoner of war camps and uh yeah they would tell them that you know everything was fine
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.920]  we're taking you somewhere for you to be safe and now into the emergency centers establishing
[47:48.920 --> 47:55.160]  that it it says oh during the collapse we'll have these camps for you but there will be re-education
[47:55.160 --> 48:01.720]  though we will have to re-educate you and make sure you're not a trollmaker regarding the bath
[48:01.720 --> 48:08.520]  alex beautiful viennese uh peresian operetta music you know i did read that they would play
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.480]  i'm happy music when i well i mean but that means it's it's happy i mean it's you know our problem
[48:13.480 --> 48:18.760]  is alex we're just not drinking enough fluoridated water eating enough toxic foods all of which has
[48:18.760 --> 48:24.520]  been deemed to be safe by the same government that told us what happened on 911 they don't have to
[48:24.520 --> 48:30.600]  march us uh to the gas chambers alex they're bringing the gas chambers to us with the chemtrails
[48:30.600 --> 48:37.080]  with the environmental toxins nuclear radiation and telling us it's all good i appreciate your call
[48:37.800 --> 48:44.520]  last night i was exercising and then i want to get a shallot for dinner because i was already
[48:44.520 --> 48:47.640]  it was already so late uh getting out of work and then going to exercise that i wasn't going to get
[48:47.640 --> 48:53.800]  to see my children so i pulled into a restaurant and i was eating a uh blue cheese wedge salad as
[48:53.800 --> 48:59.480]  my dinner and uh everyone at the bar where i was eating was a listener there were about six people
[48:59.480 --> 49:05.400]  at the bar they were all listeners all of them which again just statistically this is happening
[49:05.400 --> 49:09.000]  all over the place now i mean it's i can't even gauge how big our audience is but i'm not bragging
[49:09.000 --> 49:13.800]  the point is it's good news the word's spreading and this fella comes over with this friend he goes
[49:13.800 --> 49:18.440]  ham along shoreman it's not really time for me to retire but i'm close enough i'm getting out
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.600]  because they're trying to force me to take an anthrax shot and he knew all about it how he'd
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.520]  they did two rounds with the military that killed a bunch of people their own doctors
[49:26.520 --> 49:32.760]  said no uh it was a experimental you can't make military take that but he said well we're under
[49:32.760 --> 49:41.000]  a navy contract so they just say you're fired if you don't so i said i quit and he was talking about
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.480]  all the health issues people that took them i mean i mean folks it doesn't even protect you
[49:45.480 --> 49:50.920]  the smallpox shot because you can't that's for a bacteria that that's going to replicate most
[49:50.920 --> 49:56.520]  vaccines but generally they're for viruses they work better with viruses uh anthrax is like a plant
[49:56.520 --> 50:02.200]  based bacteria basically it spores so there's no way to really make a vaccine for him but but the
[50:02.200 --> 50:07.000]  point is they know that bio poured up in michigan you know they got suspended and all that they've
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.640]  given it to people two separate times and it's killed a bunch of people and he knew that but it's
[50:11.640 --> 50:19.960]  come to the point now okay well you're fired well i quit i was talking to him and i saw this military
[50:19.960 --> 50:23.000]  guy with his wife listening everything we were saying to tell him he was in the military haircut
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.920]  is bearing he looked all freaked out uh and i was just thinking about all these nurses i know
[50:28.920 --> 50:33.480]  who go in now and they go out there's 15 shots you got to take or you're fired or you got to
[50:33.480 --> 50:39.320]  wear a mask like you're you know a bad person and then the flu shot makes you get a double the chance
[50:39.320 --> 50:43.640]  the next year of getting the flu does it protect you from that year's flu that's all come out in
[50:43.640 --> 50:48.440]  the news big companies have been caught adding stuff to it to make you sick i mean yeah they're
[50:48.440 --> 50:53.800]  lining us up and killing us i mean it's just so and now they're getting ready to make the police
[50:53.800 --> 50:59.240]  and first responders take all this stuff you guys said no in 2002 you better say no again

[56:47.880 --> 56:53.640]  when something happens any event we try to find a logical explanation it's our natural instinct
[56:54.280 --> 57:00.440]  you know when a meteor hits the ground we look for a crater and so on and so on and you know
[57:00.440 --> 57:06.360]  with 9-11 there is so much evidence that it's overwhelming and people most people that i try
[57:06.360 --> 57:12.040]  to speak to about it just almost shut down and they can't absorb it they just psychologically
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.560]  it's too much form and you know you got to think about it psychologically we're saying something
[57:17.560 --> 57:25.160]  that's challenging their whole entire belief system so if we can break the code of 9-11
[57:25.160 --> 57:33.160]  psychologically actually some i mean i'm no expert but you know you have to explain to people
[57:33.880 --> 57:41.160]  who had something to gain from this what powers are influential enough to pull off something like
[57:41.160 --> 57:45.960]  this who stands to gain who had the means and then look at the evidence bingo it's the number one
[57:45.960 --> 57:51.240]  suspects a military industrial complex owned by foreign banks who's been caught doing false flags
[57:51.240 --> 57:57.080]  over and over again and planning them ie uh things like operation northwoods but what you've
[57:57.080 --> 58:02.200]  said is so key we've got to take the myth of 9-11 that's been used to kill our republic
[58:02.200 --> 58:06.600]  and we've got to destroy that myth and we've really done that two years ago they the the
[58:06.600 --> 58:11.240]  media was like we don't want to cover it now we want to drop it because they can't really use it
[58:11.240 --> 58:16.680]  now they're saying oh al qaeda is friendly there are friends it's it's the it's the it's the american
[58:16.680 --> 58:21.720]  people are the terrorists that's what that's what this police states for so they're hoping we forget
[58:21.720 --> 58:27.560]  that they want to get off the narrative of 9-11 because it hurts them so bad stay there i want
[58:27.560 --> 58:32.040]  you to be able to finish your points we'll get to others back in one minute um we have the second

[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:54.920]  the 20 smoking guns of 9-11 and i'm gonna have paul repost this as one of the top stories later
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:00.200]  at info wars.com or perhaps i'll have kurt and emmo do that as well but but bottom line
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:05.320]  criminal elements are allowing terrorists to attack or in some cases staging attacks
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:10.600]  or provocaturing attacks sometimes they provocateur that's the most common just get crazy people and
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:17.880]  hype them up to do low-level asymmetrical attacks then they also let things happen which is actually
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:22.200]  a very rare type of attack most terror groups even though they don't know it or funded by western
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.920]  intelligence to have full spectrum dominance you got to have a dance to be able to dance you
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.800]  got to have a partner you got to stage something to have a war and control the economy and take
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.880]  the liberties and then there is of course which is the most devastating and highly organized
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:42.680]  that's where government purely carries it out and then burns patsies you see that in operation
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:50.760]  northwoods operation gladio you see that in many other programs and if you see that in the uss main
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.280]  blown up in 1898 to blame the spanish hitler's rise stag hitlers operation hemler at gliwitz
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.600]  staging terror attacks blame on the polish government that's been a well declassified
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:08.040]  brought out in the nuremberg trials the idea of inside job false flag is now known show who
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.760]  stands to gain corrupt interest from staging attacks or letting them happen from all the
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:20.120]  research we've done 9 11 was a purely staged manufactured event was it provocateur didn't
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:25.880]  let it happen they've tried to spend it in congress and in the new york post and say oh they knew
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.320]  and let it happen because they've been caught knowing it was happening and standing down and
[01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:34.520]  ordering the fbi who was not involved to stand down the deputy director quit over it he was
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:40.840]  killed on 9 11 and looked that up mr. o'neill this is very small groups at the top through
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.360]  compartmentalization and need to know control this entire operation and if people can't understand
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.800]  this let me give you two movie analogies and i'll go back to your calls with your smoking
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.680]  gun of your take 11 years later on how this has been used to kill our republic let me use a little
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:06.040]  more uh not as popularly known it was a big movie but not a mega hit final fantasy uh a meteor
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:10.520]  crashes into the earth carrying these entities that are from basically another dimensional
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:16.360]  shifts you can't really see them and most of the earth's population has been wiped out there's a
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:22.520]  space command in orbit there's a few cities left on the ground a few dozen new york's the biggest
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:28.040]  and this general wants to basically take over the head of the space defense because he wants to
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:32.040]  shoot the meteor core to try to get rid of it but they found every attack only makes it stronger
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:38.840]  uh and um again final fantasy it's pretty good movie it's new agey but the point is
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:45.000]  it's got a good good plot so the general wants to let in a few of the entities through the shields
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.640]  so he can say see i'm right we've got to attack them ends up destroying all of new york that's
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:55.240]  a false flag okay it's a frame up i don't know how i'm supposed to explain this they said it was a
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.880]  conspiracy theory for 40 years it was never a conspiracy theory that the gulf of concat in
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:06.680]  1964 was staged it became a rumor because people like telephone didn't have the san diego herald
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.760]  tribune about six months you can pull this up on microfilm it's online you can look it up
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:20.600]  about six months after that event happened that officially got us into the vietnam war the ships
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.320]  get back and a captain and some others were asked by the media they said morally we're not gonna lie
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:32.360]  we were not attacked in two separate events then it becomes a game of telephone where oh i heard it
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:43.400]  didn't have really happened so it becomes a big rumor okay but on the 60th anniversary 2004
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.560]  was it 50th anniversary it's 40th okay i'm gonna do my math now on the 40th teleprompter for you
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:58.920]  folks on the 40th anniversary of 1964 2004 they released the audio and i sat there we actually
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.760]  broke it and i played it on the air and then finally some media picked it up i'm not bragging we
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.280]  broke it it just shows how lazy media is i sat there one night all night my wife came down like
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:12.120]  six a.m. and she said what are you doing i said well i had to find it i'd always heard it was in
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:21.560]  these transcripts and there was lbj with mac numera and i guess it's like when you're from
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.240]  when i've heard potheads do when they're like on the phone with their buddy wanting some weed they're
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.640]  like hey can you bring the coffee by or hey can you bring the paint by or oh yeah it's really good
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:37.960]  green stuff and they're sitting there he's he's at his ranch outside austin and mac numera is up at
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:42.680]  dc he's like okay now tomorrow there's going to be an event like the other one uh the press is going
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.800]  to be there uh you just come out and you say this and this and then and then uh you kind of you
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.800]  don't know what's going on and then the next day well we played the tape everybody's heard it the
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:55.800]  point is is that then you come out and say well they got to do something we got to have a resolution
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:59.880]  and uh again coming up uh there'll be another attack it's gonna happen tomorrow
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:08.680]  and so he and then you hear the president sitting there taking his orders okay so i say this so i
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:13.160]  went and listened through hundreds of hours you know fast forwarding of these mac numera things
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:19.240]  they put on c span you know the fold 40 years later declassified and you've got to listen to it
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:25.880]  every time the tape loops over is it so old it goes boom boom boom boom boom boom and it's real
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:32.200]  bad audio but you can hear the president sitting there while all of this is being recorded okay
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:36.360]  so there you go that's what's going on that's what's happening i said i'd go to your calls let's take
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.640]  a bunch of them but but that's what we're talking about this is real this was staged and later i'll
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:46.520]  tell you we know it's staged we know the official story is a lie but we've reverse engineered as
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.640]  it's one thing to know the official story isn't true but it's hard it's hard to find out exactly
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:57.000]  what they did but i've done deep research to have a pretty good idea of the most probable of what
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.280]  really happened i'll cover that uh at the start of the next hour and go through the 20 smoking guns
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:08.680]  uh gem in california thanks for holding go ahead hey thanks man hey um i was turned on to you
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:15.080]  actually at a 9 11 roundtable that you did on coast to coast uh years ago and it was i mean
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:22.680]  it was probably one of the best radio programs that i'd heard uh on on that show and um what i
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:29.400]  what we've learned so much since then um i think that you know with jesse ventura and now even george
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:37.000]  nori uh have featuring dr judy wood i wondered when are you going to bring her on and have a
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.440]  serious discussion about her work because she's quite the academic and i just have always no no
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:47.160]  no i hear you i hear you and i appreciate your call i don't i don't really know judy and i haven't
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:55.320]  read her book um but immediately the space beam energy weapon crowd came out and was real aggressive
[01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:00.360]  not even so much her but others you better cover this so we're gonna expose you and then i saw one
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:04.680]  of the former bush administration officials just do some things that i knew was meant to discredit
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:09.320]  everything that we're really trying to i'm not saying she's like that but the whole thing when
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:14.520]  people try to ram stuff down my throat i get my hackles up you know it's like one time i was you
[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.760]  know going to a gun rally here and i showed up people said you're not welcome to speak here but
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.520]  my audience was all there and so i said i'll do whatever i want you know i mean i'm kind of the
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.960]  type of guy where if somebody tells me this is the way it is whether they're a cop out of control
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:34.040]  a bureaucrat or anybody else uh or a citizen i kind of bow up uh but there wasn't just a whole
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:41.160]  controversy of end fighting over bombs in the buildings versus space beams and all i know is
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:46.760]  explosive residue was found you can see blast quids on seven i want to discuss the police saying
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:53.080]  get back they're blowing it up you know i want to discuss the hardest info not create a whole fight
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:20:00.600]  over uh you know really complex things that can't be proven one way or the other there you go the
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.720]  worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on

[01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:16.920]  vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing

[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:11.800]  in the last 11 years since 9-11 of course i predicted the attacks 9-11 saying they blow up
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:17.080]  the world trade centers blaming on their asset bin laden and launch attacks in afghanistan i can
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:21.800]  see the preparations really about a year before 9-11 and then six months before i was saying
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:27.640]  they're going to stage terror attacks and then by july 25th 2001 i was able to break it all down
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:34.600]  on record that i saw that coming because i saw the media preparing everyone for the attack
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.320]  since then i've seen real attempts to create fissures and divide and conquer in the liberty
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:48.280]  movement or in or in the historical you know of societies about which area is most important to
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:55.880]  investigate we've looked at it all but when you have groups that from the beginning make it about
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:25:03.560]  infighting and attacking other researchers uh i run from that because in this society so many
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:09.480]  people that i've worked with built up put them on the map believe that if they could ever i'm gonna
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.720]  talk about what the caller called about earlier if they could ever bring me down that they would
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:20.120]  suddenly be big i mean it's crazy folks i have helped people in ways that are unbelievable
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:25.880]  and then the things they make up the things they do the things they say it's just shocking what goes
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:33.640]  on but that's not just in the media that is all across the board uh a a a a general sickness in
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:40.120]  society what i try to do is go hey in history governments have staged terror attacks here's
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.480]  dozens of admitted examples by our government and other governments okay so now you understand
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.320]  this is plausible to look at now let's look at the evidence and then i go to building seven i
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:57.320]  go to the norad stand down i go to 44 000 us troops 17 000 18 000 british troops
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:02.360]  massed in the tzatzika stand which biggest stand in surrounding areas in a six month buildup uh
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:10.520]  associated press uh roiders reported as well that bush signed launch order to attack afghanistan
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:17.080]  on september 10th guys type that in bush signed order to attack afghanistan on september 10th
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:22.760]  it was set for a week after that for it to go i mean this was all ships arriving troops getting off
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:26.840]  you know the media saying bin laden's about to hit what do you do you give your rights up one of
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:32.840]  the attacks i mean it was jim jones koolaid drinking drills on the news i'm not smart to know an attack
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:39.800]  was coming here's the bad man when he gets you what do you do we have our rights up so i go into
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.080]  all those areas a full spectrum but you know this happens in academia too where people fight over
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:50.120]  their different theories and ideas all i know is the official story is not true there it is
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.920]  london guardian bush team agreed plan to attack the taliban the day before september 11th yeah
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:01.880]  that's london guardian but but but again the the actual order is public now he signed the order
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:08.200]  agreeing on an attack a week hints on september 10th jeb bush ap world net daily declared
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:14.360]  preemptive martial law in florida with no hurricane on september 7th because they were
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:20.520]  and i say bush wasn't involved whoever told jeb obviously was they were planning to have
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:26.120]  the shanksville pennsylvania plane go into the capital and boy they had to take the capital
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:31.240]  how can you imagine well congress is disarrayed and things we have to you know move to this system
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:36.600]  they were planning a total takeover but the word is from the commanding generals and others
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:43.880]  they even gave them awards and uh don de grand prix big arms dealer of kernel and special ops
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.560]  got a heart attack shortly after uh he said the happy hooligans of north dakota assigned to virginia
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.760]  they refused orders and the general said aim nine and later that came out in the in the tapes
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:00.120]  they go that doesn't mean anything they put two aim nines into flight 93 that's why it spread over
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:06.280]  eight miles and they just showed an engine hole and said that was the plane then they had debunking
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:12.200]  things where well by map quest it's eight miles no no no the state police reported debris eight
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:19.240]  miles not by road or by traveling but as crow flies so they they swam two aim nines in there
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.920]  and that kind of messed up their narratives they said oh there was a let's roll thing and this woman
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:31.880]  the solicitor general's wife ulson she called her husband the fbi admits looked this up look it up
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.920]  they checked the records there was no call they were saying at 30 000 feet her phone was working
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:43.480]  the only real calls off air phones the only real calls off air phones report not one but two different
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:49.560]  aircraft and stewardesses flight attendants excuse me saying there's some type of gas can't breathe
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:54.440]  so it looks like some of the aircrafts landed and got people off
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:00.200]  others actually had people on board who were gassed we're not again all we have are these pieces
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:08.760]  and again these are real these are real pieces these are real issues they fired two aim nine
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:14.200]  sidewinder missiles into that aircraft that's what brought it down by the way though they put
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.840]  up the let's roll because everybody's like wait a minute and they say well that was pre-911 people
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.240]  didn't know let me tell you pre-911 and i'm not even the baddest guy around but you get in the

[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:05.560]  don't give money to united way they fence the money out to anti-gun groups they give the money to
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:10.920]  anti-family groups they give the money to agenda 21 groups when nobody knew what that term was to
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:16.120]  take over your towns and cities and tell you they're going to manage things and of course later it
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:21.400]  came out that both groups didn't give the majority of the money to any type of victims or even use
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.320]  it for disasters anywhere they use it for pr and for their salaries and for anti-liberty agendas and
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:33.160]  i said send them breathing apparatus we found a few local churches and we had our listeners on
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:39.400]  records september 12 13 14 15 for a week we said do not believe the government the dust is deadly
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.280]  do not go into the area those buildings are built out of asbestos there's all sorts of toxic stuff
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.200]  in there we went through the whole list of it but they wanted to open up wall street and all that
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.520]  they wanted to have it all continue so they said hey don't worry don't wear any mask everything's
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:02.600]  fine they didn't just say oh it's not that bad they said no mask needed and people would be in
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:07.400]  there for minutes without a serious respirator and have nosebleeds and of course uh the big
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.320]  universities you can look this up within just a few months did CAT scans of the lungs uh the
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.520]  mount sinai medical centers all of them all over the country they had the firefighters the police

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:31.880]  as the politicians you know poses saviors and worked on that pile and they said it's a conspiracy
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:37.960]  theory you're not sick and within two years all the police dogs die of different types of cancer
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:44.920]  lung nasal you name it and and the statistics now it's thousands of dead i mean just off the
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.880]  charts cancer i've been there with the firefighters and police uh you know who were at the speaking
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:54.280]  event six seven eight years ago where they'd be coughing blood up in the green room taking off
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.400]  the oxygen you know mass to go out and give a speech and then i'd read the new york post say
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:06.600]  they're ambulance chasing you know that they want to get covered that's just for their medication
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:12.360]  and the guy that heads up the main foundation even gave his kidney to one of the people just
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:17.880]  just amazing work that they've done and i gotta say we are change and and info warriors everybody
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:23.800]  really you'll put on benefits i put on in game for free to a packed house uh paid to go all the
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.880]  equipment my people there so i didn't just give up all the proceeds i paid to put it on and then
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.760]  the proceeds uh you know gave that to the feel good foundation john field uh i mean we've we've
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:41.240]  tried our best while being called scum in fact you notice last year first responders
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:45.880]  weren't allowed into the pile that's because they're so angry and they keep saying stuff
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.280]  when juliani walks by remember that last year people don't remember that guys type in first
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:57.240]  responders first responders uh not not welcome at nine eleven ceremony it was for politicians
[01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:05.080]  to sit there in grandstand remember that last year well now the loving government has come out
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:10.600]  federal government may finally recognize nine eleven cancer link say attorneys for survivors
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:16.520]  that's out of the new jersey news nj.com here's another one out of cbs nine one workers celebrate
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:23.080]  victory they're not heroes they're just workers over addition of cancer coverage but concern
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:29.960]  about funding yeah the the the government insurance they got from this didn't even cover cancer
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:35.080]  and it just goes over but now they're having good folks we had christina todd whitman's own
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:39.400]  reports she came out and said the dust is deadly the first day and then he was ordered lies they
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:47.800]  put out a fake report saying it wasn't let me tell you atomized asbestos and the mercury from all the
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:53.080]  switches and all the computers and all that blown sky high by those weapons they had inside
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:58.280]  you're breathing that i mean give me a break you see the people that day the cops would just blood
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:03.960]  running out their nose blood coming out their mouth let me tell you rescue were not out of tide
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:09.240]  you know side had goggles on they should have said everybody everybody drive to new york bring
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:14.680]  them goggles bring them respirators everything you know hey let's move the stock exchange you
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:19.880]  know five miles up the road to a warehouse they could have done that but no it's fine go on and
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:25.400]  open schools down the block it's fine and all these famous people have died that had apartments
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:30.280]  down there who's the big famous singer died and her doctors are telling her yeah it's the dust
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:34.600]  that just died a few weeks ago a few months ago yeah because they told her oh go right back in her
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.320]  apartment had its windows knocked out with dust in it oh that dust is just fine honey cakes
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:46.280]  there's a government just so cold-blooded that it doesn't just not care about the first responders
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:51.000]  they hate you so remember that military when they want you to take vaccines that are experimental
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.840]  it turns out they're being paid to test on you there's no law you got to take experimental
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:02.680]  shots in the military okay we've got all of that going on we've got all of this happening remember
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:06.600]  that because they're now trying to make first responders take shots again saying you'll be
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:13.560]  fired nurses organize and say no EMTs organize and say no police organize and say no like it
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:20.760]  did in 2002 with the emergency health powers act the model states health emergency powers act
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:27.480]  say no a bunch of states said no to barcodes for kids at schools 10 years ago say no again
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:34.440]  learn to say no no no because if they can make the first responders take shots
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.120]  they're gonna make us that's what this is about that's what the the model states
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.560]  health emergency powers act was about making them all take it so they'd say well we had to take it
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.280]  you're gonna take it we're all in this together i'm gonna go to some calls and then some financial

[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:15.640]  yes i'm going to do 10 hours and go over 500 smoking guns with exhibits on the money bomb and
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:19.880]  i'm supposed to announce that this week because our haters hate it you know george soros gets your

[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.840]  need your financial support not just at the money bomb but every day like i'm going to announce that
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:49.400]  in uh the the the beginning of the second third it'll be in the middle or so of october so i've
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:57.320]  got to go ahead and get that announcement out soon go ahead um jeff i wanted to talk about
[01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:04.360]  how i woke up which was the pentagon incident uh there was no plane wreckage uh they reported it
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:11.160]  was originally a 50-foot hole than a 60-foot hole the roof line was intact for 50 minutes before
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:16.760]  collapsing uh the plane couldn't even fit underneath the five-story building without
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:23.720]  selling out on the front lawn there's no well i mean it looks like according to munitions experts
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:28.040]  it looks like what a bunker buster does and then the footage they released that you know they kept
[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:34.120]  hundreds of tapes the one footage they released you know it looks like a missile trail coming in
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:40.120]  but again i i i never really harp on that because it's kind of a tar baby where you can't you know
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:46.200]  get anywhere my issue is they blew up building seven in front of everybody go ahead but there's
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.080]  there's like 10 cameras on every side of a pentagon at the top of the pentagon and they
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:57.960]  released that footage from the video surveillance cam and it looks like a white missile it it it looks
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:03.560]  like a drone with a missile trail behind it well it's a missile that's painted to look like an
[01:42:03.560 --> 01:42:08.280]  american airline's flight and then that's why they have it horizontally because there's no wing
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:18.360]  how important is it to you that we expose 9-11 i think it's the biggest hope that's
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:24.360]  ever been pulled on this earth i i try to lead some people up and they they they hear you for a
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:29.720]  little while and then you tell them that the towers were were blown up by a controlled demolition
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:36.360]  from top down and all the facts the bomb sniffing dogs removed two weeks before um marvin bush just
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:42.520]  had the security for the twin towers i mean all the things that tie in together oh i forgot about
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:48.440]  that i mean i first heard that right after 9-11 i went and looked it up his contract ended september
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.840]  10th and he literally handed the keys back that morning and then bragged he was on the subway
[01:42:52.840 --> 01:43:01.160]  when it got hit marvin bush ran security and your interview with erin russo changed my life that i
[01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:08.600]  that's how i kind of found out about all about info wars and you have changed my life and i think
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:16.840]  everybody needs to get on your station and just listen to you two hours and and and just wake up
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.800]  and it's unbelievable how many facts that you have you have really changed a lot of people's
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:27.960]  life well god bless you sir i appreciate your call listen do you know what the responsibility is like
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.280]  knowing that we really reach tens of millions a week conservatively now um
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:39.800]  um i just constantly think about points i need to make and and i need to do a better job and that
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:45.800]  because instead of making my ego bigger it's had the opposite effect where it's like wow
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.760]  i feel like i'm a brain surgeon or something working on a little kid's brain i better not
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.800]  screw this up you know what i mean it's with great power comes great responsibility and then i just
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.800]  get so mad and exhausted i kind of power through it by yelling and screaming but you know god works
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:07.240]  in mysterious ways i i i just want people to know that i'm not arrogant about the power in full
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:12.600]  wars s in fact it's the opposite i'm i'm really trying to do the best job i can and i need your
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.400]  prayers because it's not just government and corporations that engage in dirty tricks against
[01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:24.040]  us there's also a lot of people of the huge you know awakening that's happening conspiracy or
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.160]  questioning known liars as it really is the awakening movement is the hottest biggest thing
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.760]  it's only going to get bigger and i'm the biggest thing in that quote genre in the world it's it's
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:40.680]  really the end of the matrix or the triumph the conquest of the globalist it's either the end of
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:49.080]  their system or the beginning of their true reign and the amount of jealousy and envy and hatred of
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.880]  people i've tried to build up and help because my instinct is build others up my instinct is create
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:45:00.680]  new soldiers in the fight uh really upsets me for humanity and uh is just very very sad
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.680]  but that's why those of you that know your pure of heart and know you're good you've got to be the
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:12.440]  leaders because there are so many bad people the globalists in but also bad people that are
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:17.240]  opportunistic to kind of move into this awakening as people wake up it doesn't then mean everything
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:21.640]  else that people exposing the globalists it doesn't mean just because the globalists are
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:27.960]  bad it doesn't mean everybody else exposing the globalist are good you see what i'm saying you
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:33.400]  know it's not like america bad i ran good or i ran bad america good it's no people running america
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:41.960]  bad people running i ran bad you see it's not so our problem is morally we've become lazy it was a
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:51.080]  french philosopher victor hugo and statesman who said prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:58.520]  i kind of butchered it it sounds better the way he said he said adversity makes men prosperity makes
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:03.560]  monsters and it's true you've been around people that really have dangerous jobs there are people
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:09.000]  that really have to know what they're doing they're talented they're energetic they're you know they
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.040]  understand things and you kind of run the people who are like lazy and and they wear their laziness
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.680]  and they're not carrying like a suit of armor i mean i'm looking watch people and man there's
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:25.320]  like a culture of being weak there's a culture of being pathetic there's a culture where you get into
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:32.440]  being stupid you get into being jellyfish like you get into being decadent and uh those people
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:37.800]  are the problem in fact i had this weird epiphany last night that as mad as i get at police because
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:44.840]  they're charged with enforcing things in a corrupt society i admire the police because at least they
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:51.000]  go out and do do something dangerous they do go out and have the nerve to pull people over all day
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:56.360]  and and and to you know go to wrecks and see people cut up and clean up toxic waste on the
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:04.760]  road and take in stinking prisoners and go to houses where there's a uh i will tell you if i
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.560]  was a cop working in a major city i would probably turn into a monster very quickly i mean i really
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:15.320]  had this epiphany that if i was a cop i would be a monster because i would get real sick of it real
[01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:21.400]  fast i had this epiphany last night and the police do horrible things and wrong things but they are
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:28.120]  at the bottom room of a rotting society all the rotting dripping trash is just dripping down on
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.840]  them and when you dance with the devil he don't change you change let me tell you i've turned
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.320]  into a really a more aggressive person than i ever was before focusing on this news just looking at
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:46.760]  it has made me a different person i'm now really ranting aren't i max in utah max you're on the air
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:59.800]  go ahead hey how are you doing yes yeah um i had a comment about the um what happened on the uh
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:10.040]  uh inside the plane and uh my theory of it um it goes to um if you listen to that uh
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:16.440]  interview with james woods where he saw the so-called dry run yeah i'm gonna tell you at
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:22.120]  eight after next hour what really happened on 9 11 is best we know that james woods the famous actor
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:28.600]  is a key area yeah if you listen to what he says on that bill o'reilly interview he said that
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:34.040]  and he was in there and then that he noticed it and everything and then he makes a comment he said
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:42.680]  that the way they were acting it was so obvious that it would be obvious to even the most casual
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:48.600]  observer that's a quote and you know when you think about it and i think well you know if these
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:59.160]  guys were trying to carry out uh you know a covert dry run how could they be so incompetent that it
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:07.000]  would end up being so obvious that even the most casual observer well we know why and it's not just
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.160]  a theory we know they were brought into the u.s and protected we've talked to the head of the u.s
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:18.440]  embassy in jeta saudi arabia uh who was ordered to and his colleagues were ordered to let them into
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:22.680]  the country even though they were listed as terrorists they were told that's their cia cover
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.840]  newsweek and time admitted they were trained at u.s military bases the head of the defense
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:31.560]  language school uh colonel butler went public and said the government had to do this these guys
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:36.760]  were trained at my school some of them these are agents these guys on the news so then they told
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:43.240]  them you're taking part in drills to see if airport security will catch you and they do this all the
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:47.320]  time they do this with military guys try to bring this bomb on the plane for america then they say
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.680]  oh this green beret wanted to blow it up why the white al-qaeda that guy's a christian baptist see
[01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:57.560]  they're the new threat don't don't take part in these drills military and police with the feds
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:50:04.520]  don't be idiots to do not take part in that use your brain and that's what happened they got them
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.320]  on the plane they did many of these drills and they would get up and run around on the plane
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.280]  they were told to see if the sturdices the flight attendants would notice and what would happen
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:17.320]  and then one day they got on the plane and something else happened that's my point i wasn't
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:21.800]  i ran up to the break never finished my point i wasn't bragging hey i kicked the guy's butts on
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:26.920]  the airplane anybody i know i mean even guys that aren't looking for a fight will you know
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:31.080]  you know get in a fight i mean if a big guy pulled out a knife a lot of men would get up
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.800]  and fight i mean that's what men do i mean if you've got you know 30 40 men on board you're
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:39.400]  gonna find 10 of them they're gonna get up out of their seat and say you put that knife up right
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:44.520]  now and if they didn't it'd be i mean it'd be on i don't believe that on four different flights
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:48.840]  the i mean i know women that would get up and attack you you're not gonna have red blooded men

[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:32.680]  massive moves into gold purchasing what bloomberg news describes as gold hordes soros alone doubled
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:39.480]  his holdings in one day russia's latimer putin has doubled down on gold increasing the country's

[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:19.320]  i own my gold as a hedge against inflation this fiat federal reserve currency could go the way of
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:29.320]  the deutsch mark of the weimar republic anytime in these crazy times it makes sense to physically hold

[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:22.200]  the headlines paulson and soros add gold hoard billionaire soros soros paulson bet big on gold
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:28.280]  abc news i mean these are the type of reports i have here and gold is continuing to go up because
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:32.920]  now as you said yesterday they're not just talking about qe3 they're just saying we're just going to
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:38.680]  start calling it quantitative easing and just just open the floodgates up if that happens what's
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:44.280]  going to happen to gold well quantitative easing uh is a way of saying they're going to turn on the
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.640]  printing presses and what that does is it drives down the value of the currency which gold rises
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.880]  i mean every other country in the world knows this so they'll be buying gold and they'll be
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:58.600]  getting away from the u.s dollar i mean right now moody's i'm looking at a story from the street
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:04.520]  moody's is looking at uh they're warning about dropping the rating on the the triple a rating on
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:11.400]  the united states uh t bills because we're just about to fall off a fiscal cliff uh you know a
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:15.720]  lot of things that are going on right now and i i do hear the music coming but there's just so much

[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:01.240]  that there's no infraguard and that my dad was an approach by him to spy on his patients
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.640]  and my dad called in so i went and actually pulled a bunch of mainstream news articles about
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:10.600]  fbi deputized his private contractors with extraordinary powers including shoot to kill
[02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:14.680]  i'm going to be covering that some too we have news clips of them admitting it see how you like
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:19.320]  that but see that those people are counting i only get mad at shills and you can tell they're a shill
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:24.280]  you really disagree oh wow i'd love to talk to you but if it's a shill call just trying to confuse
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:27.720]  childlike minds out there better for you to tie a millstone around your neck
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:33.160]  ted finishing up here i got bloomberg just out a few minutes ago gold advances on outlook
[02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:39.960]  or further stimulus from the fed the intel i've got is they're not going to do qe3 big time until
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:46.040]  the elections are over then they're dropping the hammer ted anderson yeah well i mean that's what
[02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:51.640]  that's that's one of the obvious things to do but i can tell you this the outcome of the election
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:56.200]  isn't going to make a difference to what's going on here in the united states in our economy but
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:00.440]  uh yeah there there's going to be a lot more stimulus coming after that because the fed
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.320]  simply has to the if they want to save the base you got to realize that we're consuming almost
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:11.960]  50 percent of our gdp with the interest on the debt right now at just a hair above zero percent
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:17.240]  you increase that that percentage point to six percent and we're going to be so deep and buried
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:22.600]  it's not even funny so if they if they want the banks to fail if they want entire chaos in the
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:27.640]  united states let the interest rates rise the only way the fed can keep the interest rates down
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:32.920]  is by quantitative easing and the word is they're now admitting from what jackson hole and white
[02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:39.400]  fish and all that that they're moving towards it what's your intel on when the qe3 unlimited comes
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:43.560]  well i mean that's what they're talking about yesterday in the articles that i was reading
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:49.480]  is that rather than calling a qe3 it'll just be ongoing quantitative easing so in other words
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:53.800]  it's not one and and then something you know goes so far and it ends and then two and it goes so
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.200]  far and it ends what they're talking about rather than quantitative easing number three they're just
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.800]  saying we're going to quantitative ease and we're not going to even tell you this is going to finish
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.560]  well yeah that's like when they bought 1.4 billion bullets and it became an issue they just started
[02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:11.320]  blacking out how many they're buying so or or when it hit 27 trillion in bailouts two years in
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:15.960]  in the last two years no new numbers it's just and we finally got some it's almost 50 trill
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.200]  i mean it's just it is it is pandemonium and of course they're giving the big banks the free
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:28.120]  money interest free and then loaning it to us uh ted i know you've still got some radio specials uh
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:34.280]  uh gold's up over what 90 plus dollars the last week and a half right now you've been buying gold

[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:08.680]  i will give you my theory on what happened on 9 11 but we know the official stories of fraud
[02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:13.640]  let's go to your calls as promised frank in north carolina your take on all this 11 years later
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:20.600]  oh i don't know i think it's kind of pathetic i'm disgusted with uh my country my countrymen nobody
[02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:26.200]  standing up uh nobody's saying anything even the ones that know something about what happened uh
[02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:33.880]  just seems like everybody's very quiet to me but uh i i agree with your theory as far as the uh
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:40.520]  the uh i think the guys on the planes thought they were running drills i know that type of thing
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:47.160]  goes on i think they were used i think they were set up as patsies i don't claim to know what happened
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:51.720]  exactly where the planes um i'm pretty much on board with you there i don't know exactly what
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:12:00.520]  happened the only real phone call said we can't breathe so so they depress her to release gas go
[02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:08.840]  ahead yeah again uh where people can see the mechanics of this where they can relax and get
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:13.880]  out of the real world and then watch it in a movie would be uh the movie shooter from 2007
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:20.680]  and also a 1989 movie the package with gene hackman and tommy lee jones it shows the mechanics of
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:25.000]  actually how they go and get someone out of the military and tell them that they're going to be
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.960]  in one of these drills and how they set them up to be the fall guy the patsy the the patsy
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:35.000]  never even knows what happened they just wind up arlington road is a great example as well
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.760]  how they set patsy's up okay i'm not familiar with that one i've heard of it but uh i wanted i
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:46.920]  wanted to read a quote and get your take on it uh possibly uh this is a quote from a former director
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:52.120]  of studies with the u.s army war college uh dr allen sobrowski's a vietnam veteran united
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.400]  states marine officer a former director of studies with the u.s army war college quote
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:04.360]  this is his take on it uh all these years later uh quote it is a 100 percent certainty the 9 11
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:12.040]  attacks was a massade intelligence operation unquote now i've heard him say this myself and
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:19.000]  you want my take on that yes sir well uh i appreciate your call uh i think well i mean
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.200]  keep him there but fade him down as his phone's real bad it sounds like an electric shaver
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:30.200]  the massage c i a m i six are all completely uh integrated and undoubtedly elements of
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:37.320]  massade were casing and following the so-called hijackers um the fbi was paying for some of
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:42.280]  their houses and credit cards uh they had you know f behind formants with their landlords
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:48.440]  and that's a subgroup of the fbi not the whole fbi show i would have to say that to say it's a it's
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:59.080]  a 100 inside job i mean that's like saying one time i said well i made a film um terror storm
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:05.480]  and in it we explained from the admirals from the captain from all the survivors but i interviewed
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:09.720]  probably most the survivors interviewed admiral more the chairman of the joint chief of staff
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:14.280]  i interviewed the judge advocate general who saw the evidence uh here on the show those
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:20.600]  interviews are out there from the uss liberty and they said israel attacked the ship to blame
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:27.160]  it on egypt and that lbj was involved and ordered the carriers to turn jets back to
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:32.920]  we're going to aid it so israel could keep trying to sink the ship to blame it on egypt as a false
[02:14:32.920 --> 02:14:40.600]  flag and we and we knew years before just three four years before and 64 this was in 67 that lbj
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:48.200]  had staged gulf of tonkin so i mean there it is so i make a film saying uh this is how it happened
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:52.600]  from all the witnesses and the evidence and then the super anti-israel crowd says you're saying the
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:58.360]  u.s government did it you're saying israel isn't guilty no that's not what i'm saying it's all one
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:07.480]  big thing so to say israel 100 did it is it israel make norad stand down did israel um
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.240]  you know have the fbi find this the stage passports and all that it goes on and on but
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:21.320]  undoubtedly things that the globalist can't get the full echelon of the military to do
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:27.480]  they will use outside groups and mercs and so what i found is the united states will go and kill
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:34.120]  israelis when they want israelis killed and then israel is used to kill american citizens this
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.160]  actually come out in the news when they brag yeah we'll kill americans in america we want
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.800]  and they've got little cells in every town and so the u.s government's really the globalist
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:47.320]  government the banker government uses them to come over and kill us and its vice versa like
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:52.200]  here's a great example that's been declassified they use the british to spy on the american people
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:59.160]  for nsa and then they use the american government to spy on the brits for their system like gqa
[02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:04.840]  or whatever it's called gs gqa or whatever the term is that guys type in the name of england's
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:14.120]  england's nsa and it'll pop up i know europe's info poll nine the point is is that yes i've actually
[02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:19.000]  heard his interview heard what he goes over there's actually a washington post article a year before
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:27.080]  9 11 you can pull up where they said pentagon was and the war colleges were looking at the dangers
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:34.920]  of israel running a false flag as a pretext to get the u.s involved in the middle east more but again
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:41.240]  i don't even talking about the u.s government get into exactly the mechanics of it because
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:46.600]  all i can prove is that the official story is a lie and that they blew up building seven in front
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:50.520]  of everybody and said that we're going to blow it up and set it on tv and radio and then want us
[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:55.240]  to forget about that and if you can get them on that then you've got them on everything does that
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:17:01.000]  answer your question sir uh yes and i i pretty much agree with everything he said by the way
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:06.840]  dr allen sobrowski's not uh a neo-nazi or anything like that he has actually has jewish ancestry and
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.800]  he is a great american patriot no i wasn't saying he was uh in fact i meant to get him on guys you
[02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:18.600]  get him on i i'm not saying he's a nazi i'm saying the nazis who we know are globalists
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:23.480]  running most cases like hal turner i come out and say our government with israel tried to sink the
[02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:28.520]  liberty and they go how dare you say it was the u.s government not the israel and see how then you
[02:17:28.520 --> 02:17:33.000]  don't get the full picture do you see what i'm saying i've got a real bad line alex i'll get off
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.320]  all right i hear you i was trying to get your take on that uh let's go ahead and talk to
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:47.960]  is that michelin micheline and utah you're on the air go ahead thank you god bless you god
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:53.560]  bless america and god bless our first responders families and all those who were killed in the
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:18:01.480]  attacks our thoughts and prayers are with them today my number one smoking gun is the racion
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:09.080]  connection with the global hot program where their senior directors and control engineers were
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:17.080]  all supposedly killed in the flight flight 11 and flight 77 and the coincidence on that
[02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:23.160]  to me uh does not make any sense these men that's the that's the north woods deal where you have
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:29.080]  contractors at cia who will agree to stage their death but then that conflicts with the with the
[02:18:29.080 --> 02:18:36.840]  gas story of the gas everybody then fly it in but uh yeah those flights were all very mysterious
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:44.840]  who they had on them exactly and these men have disappeared now the men that actually ran
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:52.680]  the the large drone program for racion as well as some dod contractors and there was a heavy
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:19:00.440]  incident of flight on fight 77 of military connections and to me as i researched that was
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:09.000]  the the most important of the smoking guns as well as a 9-11 pilot organization coming up with
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.920]  serial members of two of those bowings for sale in third world countries years after 9-11
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:22.760]  i know it's and you know these aren't just theories here this is all the so-called hijackers
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:27.000]  were trained at us bases on record that's not debatable they're like i'll just never mind that
[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.800]  so they're trained at bases uh the tsa needs to take your wife in a private screening room
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:37.480]  hey but you're in the news running al-qaeda and the media says that we need to do a treaty with

[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:52.920]  know supposed to be the anniversary of of 9 11 and and what the government supposedly says you know
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:57.960]  outside forces did to us uh there's people waving flags and everything everywhere everywhere you
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:04.520]  look you see flags at half staff well i drive by fort riley kansas and i i'm looking over at the
[02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:09.960]  base housing there's huge flagpole out there no no american flag flying anywhere on that flagpole
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:17.080]  and uh i get down farther where i'm going little town called osage city kansas and there's a an
[02:25:17.080 --> 02:25:21.880]  active army reserve post there it's real small little post there's cars in the parking lot there's
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:28.280]  people around and uh again there's no flags flying on the flagpole they absolutely bear
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:36.040]  and i that just kind of struck me is you know i mean here's here's today is being forced down
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:41.080]  our throat that you know we were invaded by terrorists and and you know we we have to be
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:48.600]  protected uh because of all this and yet our own military on on bases in our own country
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:55.880]  refused to fly the flag you know i'd like to see that but there's a lot of ominous stuff last year's
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:01.320]  event they had weird illuminati eyes uh with people marching and they wouldn't let the first
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:07.720]  responders in a period uh we're under global government it's been announced i mean for all
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:13.240]  intents and purposes america doesn't exist anymore england doesn't exist uh germany doesn't exist
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:17.960]  we're under the new world order of corporate governance all over austin and the surrounding
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:25.560]  towns there they have a gina 21 department of uh uh uh hud coming in and taking over the land and
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:31.080]  saying you can't build on it and then saying only insiders can build i mean and then you go to the
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:33.880]  events they just tell you straight to your face none of it's happening even though you have all
[02:26:33.880 --> 02:26:38.360]  their own documents i mean it it is a mafia takeover i've got articles where they're using
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:44.840]  more slave labor at uh apples factories in china they have to put suicide nets up and drug the
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:51.400]  employees they make them work 18 hours a day sometimes and it's toxic and that's al gore
[02:26:52.040 --> 02:26:56.760]  i mean the more liberal it is the more evil because they're not liberals it's all a cover
[02:26:56.760 --> 02:27:02.520]  these are monster people uh they're they're a mafia that guilt you into letting them run your
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:08.360]  life i appreciate your call let's go ahead and talk to chad in texas chad you're on the air
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:16.520]  um hi all right hey buddy can you hear me all right yes sir i was just uh i guess it's it is
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:22.920]  on topic today my my smoking gun would be um i guess the original one that woke me up and that
[02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:29.960]  was 10 years ago i got a book called body of secret by john bamford who worked for the nsa
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:36.200]  yeah we worked for abc news uh nightline it as a producer it's it's about the nsa spying on us
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:41.000]  and they denied his book now it's all been proven a bamper's been on the show yeah body of secrets
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.800]  so so the nsa knew all this stuff and it turned out we did have nsa whistleblowers who said they
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:52.040]  didn't know about the attacks and stood down well and and on uh i read that book um before i'd ever
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:58.200]  heard anything about 9 11 truth or anything 10 years ago and and it really i got to pay jd2 and
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:04.680]  i just was reading it like anything else then and it just shook my my spirit my soul you know to my
[02:28:04.680 --> 02:28:09.240]  core yeah that everything's being listened to and 10 years ago they were lying about it his book
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:15.480]  did come out about about 11 years ago right before 9 11 in fact that's why six months before 9 11
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:22.760]  his book covered operation northwoods uh which which is where the government planned to bomb dc shoot
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:28.920]  up movie theaters and public places and attack military bases and blame it on the soviets to
[02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:34.840]  start world war three and have an invasion of cuba uh but eisenhower said no and so did kennedy
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:40.520]  uh and that was green lighted i mean you know that plan was green lighted but but it's bamford
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:46.280]  that exposed that well and uh when i read that i was living in norfolk virginia at the time which
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:52.040]  is the largest naval base in the world and i called uh mancow's show the next morning because like i
[02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:57.480]  said i mean i had kind of tears i had to have my wife's time read it too because i couldn't believe
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:05.160]  i was the uh a stoop kind of drone like everybody else and uh i i saw the implications of it and
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:10.280]  she read it and i figured you know she wasn't the brightest so she she could see it then i knew

[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:48.120]  of millions of people are waking up every single week humanity is beginning to come out of its
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:54.200]  slumber out of its globalist induced coma we are in the fight it does not mean we're winning but
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:58.760]  we are in the fight it's up to you whether we defeat this evil but you've got to believe in
[02:33:58.760 --> 02:34:03.800]  yourself believe in god ask god to guide you to use you as a vessel even though we're all
[02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:09.320]  imperfect and our best works are like dirty rags it is the heart that matters you start pushing the
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:15.400]  mountain god will move it but you've got to put it into action and people within the system
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:20.440]  now it's never been more out in the open that we have an evil in control of our world
[02:34:21.720 --> 02:34:25.560]  and that they're gearing up for more false flags you know that's really the important message here
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:31.960]  today let me just briefly before getting to these special reports then back to your calls go over
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:37.080]  20 smoking guns you know there's different sites that have 500 smoking guns 300
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:43.240]  and of the 500 on one side i'd say about 480 of them are really accurate but here's 20 that i
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:52.280]  compiled with paul watson last year number one in june of 2006 muck raker report investigative
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:58.200]  reporter ed has contacted the fbi to ask why 9 11 was not specifically mentioned on bin laden's
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:03.960]  wanted page on the fbi website the reason why 9 11 is not mentioned or some of bin laden's most
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:10.440]  wanted page is because the fbi has no evidence connecting bin laden to 9 11 he was told by fbi
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:17.480]  agent rex tomb we have links to fbi.gov i'm gonna have this repost at the top of info wars during
[02:35:17.480 --> 02:35:22.440]  the next break i meant to during the last one but i got busy continuing here and and again these
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:29.640]  aren't even the most important smoking guns in order they're just 20 of the most important but
[02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:35.240]  it's not like you know we count down 20 to number one it's just these are all important briefing
[02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:41.800]  point number two to you shibble edmunds or seabell edmunds was dismissed after she received
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:48.200]  you know the information while working at the nsa and fbi and that she revealed that the government
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:56.760]  had four knowledge and plans to attack american cities using planes as bombs as early as april
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:05.880]  of 2001 again she had the four knowledge told congress was told to shut up during a court case
[02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:10.680]  that arose out of the dismissal of the evidence surrounding 9 11 reporters were barred from
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:15.960]  recording any details of the case and edmunds herself was barred from even entering a courtroom
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:23.640]  when edmunds case was dismissed in 2005 no reason was provided and no opinion cited
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:28.840]  during an interview with mike malloy show in 09 shibble edmunds said to say that since the fall
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:34.120]  of the soviet union we ceased all of our intimate relationship with the live in taliban those things
[02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:40.200]  would be proven as lies very easily based on the information they classified in my case because we
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:45.320]  did carry a very intimate relationship with these people that involve central asian all the way up
[02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:50.840]  to september 11 and since then she's broken the gag order she heard the cia in command of all of
[02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:57.080]  al qaeda and basically preparing for them to take the blame for the staged event that's why uh kernel
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:02.920]  schaefer who could have killed him was told to not kill him twice because he was just a dummy
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:10.200]  to just take the blame briefing point number three again the smoking guns the following
[02:37:10.200 --> 02:37:16.840]  is a quote from mayor juliani during an interview on 9 11 with peter gennings for abc news i went
[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:23.000]  down to the scene and set up a headquarters at 75 barkley street which was right there at the police
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:27.480]  commission the fire commission the head of emergency management we were operating out of there we were
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:32.200]  told the world trade center was going to collapse and it did collapse before we could actually get
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:37.480]  out of the building so we were trapped in the building for 15 minutes and finally found an exit
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:43.640]  out walked north and took a people with us who told him this to this day the answer the question
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:48.840]  remains unanswered who told him it was going to collapse that's another important point i'm going
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:56.920]  to hurry through these number four in april of 2004 usa reported uh that the aerospace defense
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:02.680]  command conducted exercises a year before two months before and on the day of 9 11 of the same
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.320]  targets being hit but said they never heard of a plan to fly planes to the buildings now number
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:14.840]  five on september 12 2007 cnn's anderson cooper 360 reported that mysterious white planes spotted
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:19.800]  flying and restricted airspace over the white house shortly before 10 a.m the morning of 9 11
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:25.560]  was in fact air force e4b especially modified bowing 747 with the communications pod behind
[02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:31.560]  the cockpit cockpit though fully aware of the event the 9 11 commission did not deem the appearance
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:35.240]  of the military plane to be of any interest even though it was clearly the command and control
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:42.440]  aircraft uh continuing here number six three f 16's assigned to andrew's air force base 10 miles
[02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:48.520]  outside of washington dc were conducting training exercises in north carolina 207 miles away as the
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:55.080]  first plane crashed the wtc even if the planes had traveled as significantly less than their top speed
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:39:00.440]  uh 1500 miles per hour they could have been defending the skies over washington well before
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:06.200]  9 a.m more than 37 minutes before flight 77 crashed the pentagon and it just goes on with those
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:13.000]  numbers number seven compilation of videos showing wtc 7's collapse police saying get back
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.920]  they're going to blow it up the early announcement that it was going to fall before it fell
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:21.080]  falling exactly as they said it had it's the big smoking gun number eight
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:30.760]  flight 93 is fourth plane to crash on 9 11 at 10 o 3 a.m cheney only gives shootdown order
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:37.480]  at 10 10 to 10 20 a.m and is not communicated to norad until 28 minutes after flight 93
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:42.200]  has crashed and then there's the aid in congress and the and the secretary of transportation
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:50.440]  saying he basically told him stand down okay continuing uh here number nine scores of mainstream
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:56.120]  news outlets reported the fbi conducted an investigation of at least five of 9 11 hijackers
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:01.560]  being trained u.s military flight schools those investigations are now sealed need to be declassified
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:08.200]  newsweek new york times bbc we have bibliograph sources here briefing point 10
[02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:15.960]  new york firefighters mike balon and nicolas demassie went public to say they had found the
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:20.040]  black boxes the world trade center which the fbi had lied about later admitting they did happen they
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:28.760]  won't release them it just goes on and they want to say it was a cover-up number 11 hundreds of
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:33.000]  key eyewitnesses including first responders fire captains news reporters and police all describe
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.720]  multiple explosions in both the towers before and during the collapse as well as seven eyewitnesses
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:44.920]  accounts of bombs and explosions can be found the following links number 12 an astounding video
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:50.760]  uncovered from the archives of bbc news jane stanley reported on the collapse of wtc building
[02:40:50.760 --> 02:40:56.600]  seven over 20 minutes before it fell also seeing in one hour before number 13 solicitor general
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:02.120]  ted olson's claim his wife barbara olson called him twice from flight 77 described hijackers
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:07.080]  with box cutters was a central plank of the official story it goes on to show global research
[02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:13.000]  in other news where the fbi admitted in for your request that indeed they checked the phone records
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:17.320]  they did not exist and its cell phones did not work above 5 000 feet and these calls were made
[02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:25.720]  over 30 000 number 14 the size of the Boeing 757 is approximately 125 feet and yet no images of the
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:33.720]  impact zone the pentagon um show the engines or crash holes from the wings it shows a 16 foot
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:38.600]  diameter hole before it collapsed from fire um remember that was a little bit of the ceiling
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.880]  number 15 what is the meaning behind the following quote attributed dick cheney which
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:49.480]  came to lighter than 9 11 commission hearings and then that's the planes 50 miles out he orders
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:55.400]  to stand down 30 miles out he orders to stand down again that's uh from uh the uh secretary of
[02:41:55.400 --> 02:42:00.520]  transportation who's been asked five separate times and said no it was cheney was told earlier
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:07.800]  than he said and cheney ordered to stand down and then you've got all the rest of it number
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:11.560]  16 in may of oh three the miami harrell reported how the bush administration was refusing to release
[02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:16.760]  a 900 page controversial report on 9 11 because it wanted to avoid enshrining embarrassing details
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:23.160]  about the report so we need to release that number 17 newsweek twice reported the top pentagon
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:29.480]  officials got a warning not to fly september 10th and 11th to new york and we also have
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:36.360]  san francisco chronicle mary willie brown warned by patolysa rice not to fly to new york on september
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:42.520]  10th he warned or not to fly september 11th briefing 18 uh and it goes through all the numbers that
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:49.400]  cell phones don't work uh you know above just 5 000 feet that was impossible briefing number 20
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:52.760]  a few days after the attack several newspapers reported that a paper passport had been found
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:57.000]  in the ruins of wtc by the fbi that day and of course it turned out it wasn't true and that was
[02:42:57.000 --> 02:43:01.320]  impossible and i'm just abbreviating all of this ladies and gentlemen i'm gonna go to more
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:07.080]  to your calls here but first i want to go to linda west one of our info wars nightly news reporters
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:13.160]  air this here on the radio show she went out to ask americans is america still a free country
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:19.240]  out by the airport but also downtown austin and while in downtown austin we only have the
[02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:23.640]  footage as the guy walks away a guy in a business suit says i'll give you somebody to talk to
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:27.720]  because they're out there politely talking about the tsa and he starts taking photos of them and
[02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:33.640]  then calls the police on them and they were in a hurry to get back to the office uh because they
[02:43:33.640 --> 02:43:37.960]  were going to be on the show but as they're leaving the you know bicycle cops and a cop car
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:41.800]  screech up and i told him you should in hindsight you should have gone up and said oh you want to
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:46.040]  talk to us because that would have been more powerful but instead they just drove off uh but
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.600]  but i mean is america still a free country and you got a woman in a business suit and guys in
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:56.360]  suits out there asking questions professionally and the cops come in downtown austin i mean i mean
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:02.440]  it's just it's just crazy what they've trained us to live under so uh here is that report hi this is
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:08.440]  linda west reporting with info wars dot com today we're at the austin airport and we're going to
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:15.960]  be asking people about their feelings about the ever-expanding tsa in la they've passed a new
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:22.600]  policy one which makes it illegal to videotape or photograph at the airport but while it's still
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:29.880]  legal here here we are if they plan to expand the tsa which they do and to go into train stations
[02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:35.080]  and sporting events if you have to walk through a tsa and get scanned to go in the mall would you
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:42.120]  still want to do that do you still think that would be needed probably not and i recognize
[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:48.680]  terrorism can hit anywhere right but i doubt they're gonna hit me at coals um things like your um
[02:44:48.680 --> 02:44:53.480]  your card being taken and having a picture taken of your car when you go through the um the toll
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:58.440]  road having that kind of record of where somebody was at some time i think is kind of big brother
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:02.760]  starts really starts to impede our freedom at what point do you say i'd rather have my freedom
[02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:07.960]  instead of a possible terrorist attack or i mean for that point yellowstone could blow her yeah it's
[02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:12.680]  kind of like you know the taxes you know taxes keep increasing every year you know i'm a very
[02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:17.640]  successful businessman and each year more comes out of my pocket unless out of other people's
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:23.320]  pockets so so that's also freedom that's getting taken from me let's just say that i am not 100%
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:28.520]  trustful of the government what are your feelings about the tsa you know touching children's private
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:35.640]  parts that's an abomination to me and you know doing it in the name of security and with these
[02:45:35.640 --> 02:45:42.280]  fears that are you know falsely painted in the eyes of the masses in order to basically control
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:48.280]  this planet make it into a prison planet i don't know about all this tsa stuff i mean i only see
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.880]  what it's gonna do you know i mean you know i don't i mean since you asked me yeah that's why
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:59.000]  i'm asking i'm more shaky now than i was at first you know come down looking around you don't know
[02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:03.720]  what's gonna happen you know so they're more or less perpetuating fear in us right that's that's
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:10.360]  what it's done to me yeah as we were interviewing people in front of starbox a self-designated
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:18.840]  citizen spy took it upon himself to call the police on us they arrived minutes later do you feel
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:27.640]  safer now that the tsa is there patting people like you and i down no you don't know i felt like
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:32.520]  i was in like a nazi camp or something but it's just part of their plan i already know what it is
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:37.960]  it's just you know it's the new world order i went out on the street to ask everyday americans
[02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:46.440]  how they felt about our quest for protection in our country with the never-ending tsa expansion
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:55.160]  drones in our skies and even citizen spies on our streets and the local starbucks despite the fact
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:03.000]  that we all grew up in america that we proudly held as the home of the free and the brave what i
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:11.000]  found is that the america we're living in now is the home of the fearful and willingly enslaved
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:19.000]  this is linda west signing off with info wars nightly news great job linda and again she
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.800]  did a report uh text report last week because she's from la she talked to the police captain
[02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:29.000]  quoting he says we've now passed a new policy you'll be arrested if you uh film in public
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.680]  including the airport you don't pass a policy hey once you say you have a policy that i gotta come
[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:40.600]  mow your lawn every saturday morning well that's what tyranny is there is no law that you can't
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:45.400]  film at the airport anywhere there are laws they can't touch your genitals but they still do it
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:51.800]  they're exercising criminal power over us and the government runs al-qaeda that's in the news now
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:58.840]  so i don't want to hear it anymore and now they're on the streets of america now before we go
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:03.240]  back to your calls we're going to skip this network breaks we have time to do both here is erin dykes
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:08.680]  report and he recently got back a few weeks ago from germany over there visiting a nice young
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:14.520]  lady he met at bilderberger year and a half ago and uh he was over there covering the fact
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:18.040]  because they were nearby the birthplace of the illuminati that the illuminati is a real thing
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:23.160]  it's in the encyclopedia it's in the dictionary and the and the system of the illuminati has now
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:29.160]  been adopted by the globalist we're not saying they're the illuminati they're like the the the
[02:48:29.160 --> 02:48:35.480]  the offspring of the illuminati this system of secret mafias all secret societies are are basically
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:40.760]  private intelligence agencies they can be bad or they can be good but generally they become evil
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:46.360]  even if they're started as good and it's basically places for criminals to engage in in control freak
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:52.280]  behavior uh so you just heard is america still free by linda west here is illuminati origins of
[02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:56.760]  the secret society that's a good headline but i don't want erin to call it on youtube we're
[02:48:56.760 --> 02:49:01.240]  going to post it up there it's at prism planet dot tv right now i want to call it uh info wars
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:06.040]  visits birthplace the illuminati or birthplace the illuminati i think that's more of the headline
[02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:18.600]  but here is that report the illuminati does exist the secret society is so notorious that many have
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:27.560]  assumed it resides only in legend and myth but it was in fact founded on may 1st 1776 in the heart of
[02:49:27.560 --> 02:49:34.200]  bavaria germany erin dykes here for info wars dot com in bavaria germany where an engels dot in
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:41.640]  1776 professor adam weishoff founded the illuminati right here at this university and we are as a
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:48.840]  people opposed to secret societies the secret oaths and the secret proceedings but we are opposed
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:55.240]  around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on infiltration
[02:49:55.240 --> 02:50:01.000]  instead of invasion on subversion instead of election we'd like to show the historic background
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:08.120]  of the original illuminati it was here in england 1776 when adam weishoff founded the original
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:15.720]  bavarian illuminati a secret order he founded here around the university of ingolstadt and in the
[02:50:15.720 --> 02:50:23.080]  beginning it was a pure opposition against powerful jesusites they had a very strong a very important
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:30.920]  role here at the ingolstadt university of course they were trying to keep the power for the church
[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:37.080]  they were trying to avoid the modern science they didn't allow the modern science to be taught at
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:42.760]  ingolstadt university the original documents of the illuminati are preserved at the state museum
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:56.680]  adam weishoff's role in forming the illuminati inside the city of ingolstadt of bavaria germany
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:02.520]  cannot be disputed we're overlooking a model of the old city of ingolstadt professor adam weishoff
[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:08.920]  wanted to use his secret society to overthrow existing religions and all existing governments
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:14.360]  especially monarchies instead he wanted the learned men of universities using the pagan
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:20.600]  values of the old system passed down from societies like egypt and babalon to rule the world instead
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:25.880]  of the oppressive religious regimes and the oppressive monarchies that were in existence in
[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:31.720]  europe at the time it was not through armies and force and numbers that adam weishoff hoped to take
[02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:37.000]  over the existing governments and change them instead he used his illuminati secret society
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.800]  to infiltrate the existing structures of government and take them over from within
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:47.400]  his attempt to create a new world order by deception and overthrow all existing governments
[02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:54.840]  and religions behind the scenes powerful people like mayor amshel ross child were involved in
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:52:02.280]  founding the bavarian illuminati while important titled and lettered men composed its membership it
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:08.360]  claimed to work in secret only because it couldn't work out in the open the bavarian illuminati used
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:15.400]  free masonry and other competing secret society lodges as an engine to conceal its inner membership
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:21.960]  and project its agenda into already powerful circles degrees of the illuminati structure were
[02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:28.440]  adopted into many masonic traditions creating an effective venue for recruitment and control
[02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:35.080]  weishoff himself took over key lodges in neighboring munich and other parts of bavaria
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:41.400]  making the lodge saint theodore the de facto headquarters of the illuminati from that point
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:48.120]  membership swelled and the group's allies spread across europe i'm standing in the old city of munich
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:53.800]  not far from where adam weishoff's headquarters for the illuminati was found it was the lodge
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:53:00.280]  theodore also known as the lodge saint theodore albon council now that lodge is nowhere to be
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:04.280]  found on the internet although we know it's here somewhere in the old city a lot of that old city
[02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:10.520]  was destroyed in world war two but very suggestive is the church behind me that bears the all-seeing
[02:53:10.520 --> 02:53:16.760]  eye atop of it the blazing emblem of the all-seeing eye with the triangle by 1784 the bavarian
[02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:22.680]  illuminati had officially been exposed the member list and the agenda had been found on a messenger
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:27.400]  killed when he was struck by lightning and the monarchs in bavaria had the list and shared it
[02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:34.040]  with other monarchs the ruler bavaria carl theodore outlawed the secret society banished adam weishoff
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:39.880]  and the other leaders scattered weishoff himself avoided persecution under the protection to the
[02:53:39.880 --> 02:53:46.200]  end of his life by fellow illuminis duke Ernst of sax coberg gotha second in command to the
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:53.560]  illuminati add off fryhair von konighe ostensibly disbanded the group known internally as those whose
[02:53:53.560 --> 02:54:01.160]  name had been cursed by posterity the illuminati was officially over in 1785 and konighe stepped
[02:54:01.160 --> 02:54:08.120]  down from his position however historians have conclusively found that von konighe simply revived
[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:14.200]  the illuminati under the guise of numerous reading societies as weishoff had originally
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:19.880]  instructed weishoff told his initiates quote conceal the very fact of our existence from the
[02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:26.840]  profane if they discover us conceal our real objective by profession of benevolence if our
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:33.960]  real objective is perceived pretend to disband and relinquish the whole thing but assume another
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:40.760]  name and put forward new agents this plan was carried out with precision cop brass of the
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:48.440]  illuminati von konighe and Johann Joachim Christoph Bode reestablished the revolutionary organization
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:54.440]  under the guise of publishing houses that pushed for the printing of controversial enlightenment
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:55:00.760]  literature while operating behind the scenes via a clandestine inner circle that directed the agenda
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:06.520]  these reading societies and publishing houses popped up across europe and america the german
[02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:14.600]  union publishing house operated on the illuminati's home turf while the circle so shall based in paris
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:19.800]  played a critical role in the french revolution their work in france was to be the beginning
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:25.880]  of a global revolution to take over the entire world the original bavarian illuminati went
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:32.360]  underground and faded from existence but the true legacy of the illuminati continues it was the
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:38.120]  embodiment of a working model for secret government cleverly concealed within existing
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:44.600]  institutions and perpetuated by the lure of its secret mysteries and ambitious aims but those
[02:55:44.600 --> 02:55:51.000]  occultic religious trappings were just a mask for the real model of infiltration and domination
[02:55:51.720 --> 02:55:57.880]  the real illuminati continued in other secret groups working under other names at their core
[02:55:57.880 --> 02:56:03.240]  they were nothing more than private intelligence agencies who carried out their agenda through
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:12.360]  the positions of power held by their elite membership bonded by secrecy excellent job
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:15.960]  erin dikes you know i guess he should leave the headline like he has that's a great headline

[03:01:24.040 --> 03:01:29.960]  point that's one of the reasons why as soon as i woke up this morning um i actually decided to get
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:38.440]  on facebook and put some some clips from youtube uh you know about nine eleven and stuff like that
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:46.760]  just so people could see and i was amazed about how many people have already done the same thing
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:52.360]  exactly we just all need to move together with the truth and it's over for the globalist
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:02:01.080]  that's exactly my point you you my friend alex you have rung the bell and there's other people too
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:08.680]  that have rung the bell that will resonate throughout the world that's it that's it ring the bell
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:13.080]  keep ringing it we know what's going on we understand like the illuminati claim they were
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:17.800]  going to take over secretly for liberty that was how they recruited the best men the good guys
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:23.320]  to help bring them in but not to bring freedom to bring slavery was the big secret i appreciate
[03:02:23.320 --> 03:02:29.960]  your call great points uh let's talk to george in california he's a 960 fm listener kix double
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:33.480]  you one of our new affiliates have had about for about a month welcome sir what's on your mind
[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:40.760]  alex i want to thank the whole entire umpa wars team for doing a great job first of all um what
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:46.200]  i'm hearing is with the presidential election being like 56 days away that the ballots are
[03:02:46.200 --> 03:02:51.720]  going to be counted by a company a counting company in spain have you heard anything about this
[03:02:54.120 --> 03:02:59.640]  well yes they have a company doing a lot of it that's based in europe uh they have another company
[03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:05.880]  based in canada doing a lot of the counting um but i mean it's it's there's a lot of fraud
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:11.000]  it's not one company running at all but all these big voting companies their electronic
[03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.160]  have been caught you know they just they're sending a bunch of quote officials public
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:20.040]  servants in arkansas to jail who pled guilty to election fraud last week but that was like
[03:03:20.040 --> 03:03:27.400]  voter fraud voter roll fraud dead people voting they go after retail vote fraud but the real fraud
[03:03:27.400 --> 03:03:33.800]  the big fraud is electronic right and this is supposed to be electronic to spain and there's
[03:03:33.800 --> 03:03:39.080]  no accountability and there's no identifying the the people who read yeah and george soros is connected
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:44.440]  to it that's also what i heard you know what's wrong with george soros running voting in america
[03:03:44.440 --> 03:03:49.000]  having a foreign company doing i mean you do you trust george soros don't you i mean it's not like
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:53.720]  he was a nazi collaborator or anything it's not like he helped round up his fellow jews or anything
[03:03:53.720 --> 03:03:58.200]  i mean i mean if he'd done that he'd be a bad guy but he didn't do that of course he did but
[03:03:58.200 --> 03:04:04.200]  still he's a good guy i'm friendly great thank you so much all right thank you so much good to
[03:04:04.200 --> 03:04:10.120]  hear from you um i don't have time to jam in more i apologize but i did pretty good carol and joe
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:16.200]  and tim love you saw her out of time but um that's it we're going to retransmission now i don't know
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:21.000]  xm carries i used to do three hours and i did four hours and then with the nightly news i can't
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:25.240]  really do four hours every day i'd like to keep that there so choose me my first hour rears and
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:31.160]  the fourth hour so xm listeners get the second and third hour live and then they get the first
[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:35.080]  hour in the fourth hour to explain that so i'm just explaining to people out there listening
[03:04:35.080 --> 03:04:40.200]  what's going on with that but in the future now that i have six new reporters on top the others
[03:04:40.200 --> 03:04:44.600]  i'll be doing special reports and anchoring sometimes uh but i won't always be doing the
[03:04:44.600 --> 03:04:48.920]  nightly news show a lot of days we're gonna go back to four hours i just have uh you'll have
[03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:54.360]  so much to do administratively uh that it's a little bit hard to get it all done but uh our
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:59.400]  heart some prayers go out to all those killed by the globalist on 9 11 that we will avenge you
[03:04:59.400 --> 03:05:07.080]  politically
