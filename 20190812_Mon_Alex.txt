[00:00.000 --> 00:06.600]  Joe Pollock of Breitbart News confronted Joe Biden at the Iowa State Fair on the
[00:06.600 --> 00:11.680]  lie the Democrat Party won't let die. Mr. Vice President, are you aware that you're
[00:11.680 --> 00:15.600]  misquoting Donald Trump in Charlottesville? He never called neo-Nazis very fine people?
[00:15.600 --> 00:20.640]  No, he called all those folks who walked out of that, they were neo-Nazis, shouting hate,
[00:20.640 --> 00:26.880]  the veins... But he said specifically that he was condemning them. He said... No, he did not. He said he walked out and he said,
[00:26.880 --> 00:31.040]  let's get this straight. He said there were very fine people in both groups.
[00:31.040 --> 00:37.960]  They're chanting anti-Semitic slogans carrying flies. Pollock was referencing this claim Biden made yet
[00:37.960 --> 00:44.760]  again in a recent speech. When he said after Charlottesville there were, and I quote,
[00:44.760 --> 00:55.120]  very fine people on both sides. I said then it gave license and safe harbor to white
[00:55.120 --> 01:01.560]  supremacists and neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan. These wars not only stunned America,
[01:01.560 --> 01:08.880]  but they stunned the world. And in doing so, he assigned a moral equivalence, a moral
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.640]  equivalence between those spewing hate and those of the courage to stand against it.
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.600]  The nefarious go-to slanderous claim of fine people on both sides is a democratic
[01:20.600 --> 01:26.640]  hoax. It's simply not true. Here again for all to see is what President Trump said regarding
[01:26.640 --> 01:32.000]  the protesting citizens in Charlottesville, Virginia, who he had actually been referring
[01:32.000 --> 01:38.720]  to and the white nationalists who he condemned totally on that August 15, 2017 day at Trump
[01:38.720 --> 01:45.440]  Towers while dealing with a rabid propagandized media swarm just three days after the incident
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.680]  at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
[01:51.680 --> 01:58.880]  But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that
[01:58.880 --> 02:04.400]  group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that
[02:04.400 --> 02:10.960]  group that were there to protest, taking down to them a very, very important statue and
[02:10.960 --> 02:15.520]  the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. You're changing history, you're
[02:15.520 --> 02:20.260]  changing culture, and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the
[02:20.260 --> 02:24.800]  white nationalists because they should be condemned totally, but you had many people
[02:24.800 --> 02:31.800]  in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. And the press has treated them
[02:31.800 --> 02:37.800]  absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also
[02:37.800 --> 02:43.920]  had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and
[02:43.920 --> 02:49.360]  with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad, you had a lot of bad people in the other group.
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.600]  Meanwhile, Democratic front-runner Joe Biden is the one actually dangerously spreading
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.080]  hate-filled false vitriol. When Trump announced he was running for president,
[03:00.080 --> 03:09.000]  he called Mexicans rapist. Days before the midterm, he fomented fears of a caravan heading
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.600]  to the United States, creating a stereo, a stereo when he said, look, look what's marching
[03:14.600 --> 03:23.000]  up, this is an invasion, an invasion. He asserted that immigrants would quote, carve
[03:23.000 --> 03:34.200]  you up with a knife. More recently, he called a major American center, city, a disgusting
[03:34.200 --> 03:42.760]  rat-infected, rodent mess. No human being, he said, would choose to live as though the
[03:42.760 --> 03:49.280]  vibrant, diverse community around Baltimore somehow was less than human. At a rally in
[03:49.280 --> 03:56.560]  Florida, when he asked the crowd, how do we stop these people, meaning immigrants? Someone
[03:56.560 --> 04:03.760]  yelled back, shoot them, and he smiled. But lately, creepy Joe Biden has devolved into
[04:03.760 --> 04:10.400]  a gaffe machine. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. We choose
[04:10.400 --> 04:18.120]  truth over facts. Your favorite historical figure, and he's not a president, and long.
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.360]  And I'd have to start off, I know you said not a president, I have to start off with
[04:21.360 --> 04:25.600]  Jefferson, even though he didn't live up to it. He's the guy that wrote that incredible
[04:25.600 --> 04:30.560]  document. Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.
[04:30.560 --> 04:35.200]  There is a huge difference between calling things out for what they are as Donald Trump
[04:35.200 --> 04:41.320]  is done to the Washington, D.C. establishment's ire and blatantly attempting to pull the wool
[04:41.320 --> 05:00.200]  over the voters' eyes as D.C. Insider Lackey, Joe Biden, has done. John Bowne reporting.
[05:00.200 --> 05:05.560]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators. They are technocrats. They are
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.640]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[05:09.640 --> 05:14.400]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with A.I.
[05:14.400 --> 05:18.440]  Gods. Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the
[05:18.440 --> 05:22.960]  third dimension. But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[05:22.960 --> 05:27.460]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality
[05:27.460 --> 05:33.080]  supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our
[05:33.080 --> 05:37.560]  original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottle man and double the
[05:37.560 --> 05:43.840]  strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.360]  quality B12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing. Experience
[05:48.360 --> 05:53.520]  pure medical bottle man B12 for yourself and fund the second American evolution against
[05:53.520 --> 06:18.320]  the tyrants at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[06:23.520 --> 06:40.240]  It is Monday, August 12th, 2019. And yes, the Alex Jones show is still on air. Despite
[06:40.240 --> 06:47.520]  all the attempts to murder it in jail like they did to Jeffrey Epstein, here we are, all
[06:47.520 --> 06:54.480]  of us together. And on this extremely important Alex Jones show today, what an honor it is
[06:54.480 --> 06:57.640]  to be filling in for Alex. He'll be joining us shortly. We're also going to be joined
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.160]  by Robert Barnes, Patrick Cowley, and Paul Joseph Watson before Gerald Salenti takes
[07:02.160 --> 07:06.360]  over the fourth hour. And actually, I'm going to talk to Gerald when he takes over too.
[07:06.360 --> 07:12.360]  I got a couple of questions for him, but my stacks of news includes some international
[07:12.360 --> 07:17.760]  news. I have a whole stack of Epstein news that's just going to blow your mind. And then
[07:17.760 --> 07:23.240]  I've got some domestic American news that's just kind of out there, some frills on the
[07:23.240 --> 07:32.400]  whole surface, but important nonetheless. But I'm sitting thinking to myself, how do
[07:32.400 --> 07:42.760]  you begin today's Alex Jones show with this Epstein murder hanging over our heads? Because
[07:42.760 --> 07:48.760]  you want to talk about the biggest coverups of all time, the JFK assassination, September
[07:48.760 --> 07:53.800]  11th, 2001. I mean, those are probably the top of my list, but the Epstein murder might
[07:53.800 --> 08:00.160]  be the biggest one ever. Not because of its importance as far as Epstein as an individual
[08:00.160 --> 08:06.720]  is concerned and how that influences or impacts the average American's life as September 11th
[08:06.720 --> 08:15.240]  would have or the JFK assassination even. But because I always have the word they, who
[08:15.240 --> 08:25.080]  is they? Well, they got away with murdering Jeffrey Epstein. And they did it right in front
[08:25.080 --> 08:33.400]  of all of our faces. And so I'm sitting here today thinking, well, what do you do? How
[08:33.400 --> 08:42.120]  do you cover the biggest coverup of all time? And in the past info wars role is to defy
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.880]  the mainstream narrative, push the boundaries, say what people are thinking, because no one
[08:48.880 --> 08:56.800]  else will do it. But now any logical person realizes that Jeffrey Epstein was often prison
[08:56.800 --> 09:01.880]  and that it's being covered up. It's really not that hard. It's basic math. If one plus
[09:01.880 --> 09:12.000]  one equals three, even the kindergartner says no, it doesn't, it equals two. Oh, okay, then.
[09:12.000 --> 09:20.400]  So they're saying Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in jail. One plus one equals three.
[09:20.400 --> 09:25.400]  So I just want to say this before I get into all the headlines. I thought to myself, you
[09:25.400 --> 09:34.360]  know, if I was in a time capsule, which are always in time capsules of life, every experience,
[09:34.360 --> 09:42.800]  every thing that you've done is a capsule of your larger life. So what if I was just
[09:42.800 --> 09:51.800]  in a capsule for five years and I came up to the surface today? What would I think?
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.440]  What would I be feeling? What would I think of the world? How has it changed? And there
[09:56.440 --> 10:08.320]  is one thing that you cannot deny. The world has changed significantly. And I think the
[10:08.320 --> 10:16.720]  response to the Jeffrey Epstein murder encapsulates that change. So I had the crew go back and
[10:16.720 --> 10:22.040]  just print five years ago's headlines on Drudge Report. And it's got some normal stuff, nothing
[10:22.040 --> 10:28.440]  too big. But you had Obama releasing a criminal illegal immigrants into the population. That's
[10:28.440 --> 10:35.000]  still going on. And you had the Mike Brown protests going on where ironically enough,
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.120]  the same guy that did the autopsy on Mike Brown is going to be doing another autopsy on Jeffrey
[10:41.120 --> 10:46.280]  Epstein. Now we'll get into that and some conspiracy theories around that too. But just
[10:46.280 --> 10:53.120]  think about it. Think about all the false narratives the media has been able to get
[10:53.120 --> 11:00.520]  away with. Think about all the lies and all the coverups that they've been involved in.
[11:00.520 --> 11:07.960]  And now here we are today. And isn't it perfect? It's almost the Trump test 2.0. See the Trump
[11:07.960 --> 11:17.120]  test began in about 2015. And I'm not sure when you want to say it ended because a lot
[11:17.120 --> 11:22.080]  of people got off the Trump train because he's not a purist and some other reasons. But
[11:22.080 --> 11:28.680]  let's just say the Trump test started in 2015 and ended at an election night. The Trump
[11:28.680 --> 11:34.680]  test was basically look, you've got two options. Hillary Clinton, a known criminal, laughs
[11:34.680 --> 11:39.600]  about starting wars, laughs about killing sovereign leaders, is involved in so much
[11:39.600 --> 11:45.840]  crime. Her husband, the same deal, running off on Petafile Island. Everybody knows about
[11:45.840 --> 11:53.400]  the Clinton body count. So a total rat infested covered in feces wrote and vermin, Hillary
[11:53.400 --> 11:58.120]  Clinton versus Donald Trump was kind of an unknown, kind of walks into it like a lion.
[11:58.120 --> 12:01.120]  He's got some blood on him. You're not sure if that's because he was savaging someone
[12:01.120 --> 12:07.040]  or if he was just involved in protecting himself. But okay, you know, that was basically
[12:07.040 --> 12:14.120]  your option. A feces covered rat, Hillary Clinton, just gnawing and heaving or Donald
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.080]  Trump a line coming in roaring. And you're like, okay, is this guy going to eat me or
[12:18.080 --> 12:24.200]  is he going to defend me? But it's an unknown that rats going to give you rabies and kill
[12:24.200 --> 12:30.560]  you. So but that was the Trump test. Now it's the Epstein test. Now you notice America
[12:30.560 --> 12:38.160]  I mean, literally, thank God, thank this audience, thank a few other audiences out there and
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.760]  Donald Trump. We were able to pass the Trump test and it's beyond Trump. It's just common
[12:44.760 --> 12:49.320]  sense. Is there enough common sense left for us to save America? Is there enough common
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.880]  sense left for us to actually do something right as nation? So that was the Trump test.
[12:54.880 --> 13:04.200]  We passed it. Thank God. Now the Epstein test is here and the Epstein test is next level.
[13:04.200 --> 13:09.640]  When you see media publications telling you you're a conspiracy theorist, if you don't
[13:09.640 --> 13:17.360]  believe the official narrative that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, you know they are
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.840]  not your friend. How can any person in the media this was and again, this is where the
[13:23.840 --> 13:31.240]  Epstein test starts now. Any person in the media with any integrity, any self-respect,
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.160]  any conscious, any gut, any instincts not totally sold out is questioning the Jeffrey
[13:38.160 --> 13:43.760]  Epstein death at the very least. Anybody telling you shut up, believe the mainstream narrative
[13:43.760 --> 13:50.680]  is probably honestly, I hate to say this because I'm sure it's not true, but are they in on
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.920]  it? You're going to tell me, oh yeah, Jeffrey Epstein just committed suicide in jail, nothing
[13:56.920 --> 14:05.520]  to see here. Really? But they are. New York Times, Washington Post, it's all over TV,
[14:05.520 --> 14:17.000]  MSNBC over the weekend. CNN, conspiracy theories say Epstein must have been murdered. Really?
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.320]  Conspiracy theories. You mean the same conspiracy theories that said JFK was assassinated and
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.160]  there was more than one shooter and then it came out when Donald J. Trump released the
[14:28.160 --> 14:34.600]  classified JFK files? You mean the conspiracy theorists had said there was something else
[14:34.600 --> 14:43.640]  going on with September 11th and the questions still remain today? And then we launched these
[14:43.640 --> 14:50.200]  trillion-dollar wars in the Middle East that nobody won ever, nobody could win. So when
[14:50.200 --> 14:55.880]  we come back, Alex Jones is going to break it all down. But it's a new world now. It's
[14:55.880 --> 15:01.240]  a new world than it was five years ago because I don't have to come on air and tell you here,
[15:01.240 --> 15:08.280]  hosting the Alex Jones show at Infowars.com slash show that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered
[15:08.280 --> 15:12.080]  or that he didn't commit suicide. I don't know what happened, but he didn't commit
[15:12.080 --> 15:18.840]  suicide. But I don't have to be the one to tell you that today and I don't look so crazy
[15:18.840 --> 15:24.560]  telling you that today because anybody with a brain sees that. So this is the Trump test
[15:24.560 --> 15:28.120]  we passed, we got Trump in. Doesn't mean he's perfect, doesn't mean we're perfect, but we
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.040]  changed the world, we moved in the right direction. Now this Epstein case is the next test. And
[15:33.040 --> 15:36.640]  quite frankly, millions of Americans probably should have been outside that prison demanding
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.920]  answers. But we're all asleep, we're all on our cell phones. I think Kim Kardashian, you
[15:39.920 --> 15:46.240]  know, dropped a new clothing line. So, but this is the Epstein test. Now you watch, what
[15:46.240 --> 15:49.240]  is media going to say about this? Are they going to tell you to sit down, shut up and
[15:49.240 --> 15:54.640]  close your eyes or are they going to say this is a massive nuclear fire that they just tried
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.560]  to cover up? What the hell is going on? Alex Jones explains it on the other side.

[17:08.520 --> 17:12.440]  important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.280]  with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.880]  endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the historic
[17:21.880 --> 17:25.880]  flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[17:25.880 --> 17:29.880]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move
[17:29.880 --> 17:33.560]  it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.960]  unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right

[18:49.040 --> 18:53.040]  being used by God. This is Providence. So I salute you and I thank you for all you've
[18:53.040 --> 19:00.280]  done from the bottom of my heart. InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[19:00.280 --> 19:06.280]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[19:06.280 --> 19:10.680]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[19:10.680 --> 19:14.480]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today, the communist
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.160]  Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.400]  in polls, support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war. Once China put
[19:25.400 --> 19:30.120]  pressure on our farmers, that's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied and we
[19:30.120 --> 19:34.960]  aren't going to back down. So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world
[19:34.960 --> 19:39.000]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.480]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at infowars.com and
[19:44.480 --> 19:50.040]  newswars.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are
[19:50.040 --> 20:03.040]  the light, the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[20:03.040 --> 20:18.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex
[20:18.040 --> 20:25.120]  Jones show. The progenitor of all the changes in the world that we have seen to get us to
[20:25.120 --> 20:29.680]  this point started at infowars.com with this audience and Alex Jones. That's why we're
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.440]  the most censored name in news and Alex Jones is totally banned from the Internet. Alex
[20:33.440 --> 20:39.160]  Jones joins us now to cover the crazy news surrounding Epstein and everything that's
[20:39.160 --> 20:42.040]  going on in the White House. Alex Jones, take it away.
[20:42.040 --> 20:47.640]  Well, that's right, Owen. I did bring equipment so I could broadcast from the road because
[20:47.640 --> 20:53.880]  every time I tried to take even a four or five day vacation with my children, I'm unable
[20:53.880 --> 21:00.360]  to do it because giant events take place. And sure enough, this Epstein situation took
[21:00.360 --> 21:05.640]  place and then the cover-ups and the changing stories and the incredible obviousness of
[21:05.640 --> 21:10.520]  all of this has completely blown me away. And we're going to get to all of that coming
[21:10.520 --> 21:16.040]  up in the next segment and the wheels coming off the Democrats as well. But the first big
[21:16.040 --> 21:21.120]  thing and the reason I'm actually live with you today is I know you guys can handle all
[21:21.120 --> 21:26.320]  the Epstein stuff. You've got Paul Joseph Watson coming up. You've got an amazing Breitbart
[21:26.320 --> 21:31.320]  reporter coming up who's a real expert on all this. You've also got Robert Barnes who
[21:31.320 --> 21:36.480]  has been all over the Epstein situation. There was a lot of the inside baseball from DC.
[21:36.480 --> 21:41.640]  He's going to be on to a jam-packed show here today with Owen Troyer. But the real reason
[21:41.640 --> 21:45.800]  I'm on this morning is my wife yesterday is like, okay, when I did the Sunday show, she's
[21:45.800 --> 21:50.080]  like, let me guess, you're going to do tomorrow's show. And I said, no. I said, Owen and the
[21:50.080 --> 21:53.360]  crew have got a big line of guests. They're going to do a great job. The listeners will
[21:53.360 --> 21:58.520]  understand why I'm not going to be there. But then this morning I got up and I was looking
[21:58.520 --> 22:05.040]  at the news and there it was. It's a little footnote on infowars.com, Chinese troops in
[22:05.040 --> 22:09.560]  Hong Kong. And then I went online and saw the videos that people having their heads
[22:09.560 --> 22:16.280]  beat in and blood everywhere and just how huge geopolitically this is. Now it signals that
[22:16.280 --> 22:22.560]  the world is going into a hot war, just like we saw India invade the disputed region of
[22:22.560 --> 22:29.200]  Kashmir last week. This is all serious tit for tat stuff and shows that the whole existing
[22:29.200 --> 22:35.560]  world order is crumbling down around itself. And so these big developments are just amazing.
[22:35.560 --> 22:41.280]  But because there's no urgency, this morning at 7am, I'm reading that I decided to do the
[22:41.280 --> 22:47.640]  show because of it. I just could not not cover that. And then I forget about it. And I'm
[22:47.640 --> 22:52.600]  sitting here looking at the video list that the crew sent me. I'm in San Diego visiting
[22:52.600 --> 22:57.040]  my wife's family with my children and the crew sends me the clips about what's happening
[22:57.040 --> 23:02.520]  in Hong Kong. It's like a punch in the stomach that I forgot that as well because it's not
[23:02.520 --> 23:07.360]  in the consciousness. 20 people get shot to death. It's terrible. It's horrible in El
[23:07.360 --> 23:14.520]  Paso. The media acts like it is the end of the world and all of us are to blame. We've
[23:14.520 --> 23:18.400]  got to overturn the second amendment. All white people are evil, even though this guy
[23:18.400 --> 23:24.680]  was clearly a leftist Antifa. So was the other guy in Ohio. But then when you've got the
[23:24.680 --> 23:29.240]  chai comms killing 115 million of their own people, when you've got them putting millions
[23:29.240 --> 23:33.640]  a year in forced labor camps, killing hundreds of thousands, selling their organs, it's like,
[23:33.640 --> 23:39.280]  oh, big deal. That's no big deal. Or when you have hundreds of people killed very mysteriously
[23:39.280 --> 23:45.160]  in and around the Clintons and medical examiners like Fami Malik famously, who was the local
[23:45.160 --> 23:50.680]  medical examiner and Mina Arkansas, well, after kids got run over on the tracks and bullet
[23:50.680 --> 23:55.840]  wounds in their heads and after he ruled that suicide, they met in the state medical examiner
[23:55.840 --> 24:02.520]  and there would be people machine gunned off roads. Their arms and legs cut off burned
[24:02.520 --> 24:08.360]  inside plastic bags and Fami Malik would rule that a suicide. Now, obviously you can't cut
[24:08.360 --> 24:15.120]  your arms and legs and head off and put yourself in a bag. Houdini with God like powers couldn't
[24:15.120 --> 24:19.560]  do that. So this is the type of craziness. The Clinton death count is in the hundreds
[24:19.560 --> 24:23.760]  and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds. It's well over 300. There's some smaller lists
[24:23.760 --> 24:28.360]  that are like a hundred out there. No, ladies and gentlemen, Treasury Secretary, Commerce
[24:28.360 --> 24:36.000]  Secretary Ron Brown, he famously was in trouble with the Clintons and he said, if I go down,
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.960]  the Clintons go down. Well, he was found dead with a bullet hole in his head. They even
[24:39.960 --> 24:46.360]  crashed the airplane he was in. But even the Air Force medical examiner said no, he was
[24:46.360 --> 24:53.960]  shot in the head by a 45 caliber bullet. And so that segues us into the next segment. Some
[24:53.960 --> 24:57.760]  of what we're going to be covering the new Epstein developments. I called Paul Watson
[24:57.760 --> 25:02.400]  this morning. He was on later. I said, why do you think this is so obvious? And he said,
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.240]  I think it's because they want to make us totally lose confidence in the system and
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.120]  have a revolution. I said, well, we know they want to have a racial and cultural revolution
[25:12.120 --> 25:16.600]  that the left and others are funding. But I said, Paul, I don't think that's what it
[25:16.600 --> 25:22.520]  is. They are desperate. The deep state's not in full control anymore. They're so old
[25:22.520 --> 25:29.840]  school, their own panoptagonic big tech system they built is now basically exposing them
[25:29.840 --> 25:34.280]  and backfiring on them. And the complexity of the world has made it to where they can't
[25:34.280 --> 25:41.000]  kill everybody or threaten everybody or control everybody. Plus America in the world 10, 20
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.960]  years ago was asleep predominantly. And so because we were asleep predominantly, they
[25:47.960 --> 25:55.240]  thought that we were being quiet because we've been bullied. Now that the world's more awake,
[25:55.240 --> 26:01.040]  they're bullying more than ever, but the bullying is only accelerating people becoming awake
[26:01.040 --> 26:05.920]  and getting really, really angry. So the big news when we come back, we're going to elaborate
[26:05.920 --> 26:12.400]  on these surprise, surprise. They didn't just take him off suicide watch. They didn't just
[26:12.400 --> 26:18.400]  put him in a jail cell alone. You're not supposed to do. They don't have any video.
[26:18.400 --> 26:22.080]  The video camera was turned off magically. The guards were told to go home early. They
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.640]  were told, don't even check on him every 30 minutes like you do every person's cell,
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.240]  not every 10 minutes like you're supposed to do on suicide watch. And it gets worse
[26:30.240 --> 26:38.800]  than that. They have hired the JFK famous magic bullet doctor who in the congressional
[26:38.800 --> 26:45.800]  hearings found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and who signed off on the autopsies
[26:45.800 --> 26:52.400]  of JFK when JFK's brain was completely blown out. And I've had all the witnesses on the
[26:52.400 --> 26:57.640]  funeral home head on who was actually there when the FBI came in with the rifle with ink
[26:57.640 --> 27:02.960]  on it and put his fingerprint on the gun in front of them. By the way, the day after
[27:02.960 --> 27:06.800]  he was on the show, they ran him off the road and Austin tried to kill him. Side issue.
[27:06.800 --> 27:10.000]  But he's a famous, I don't even know if he's alive. It's like 90 something when he came
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  on the show and ended up having funeral homes all over Texas becoming very rich. He only
[27:15.000 --> 27:20.800]  had one funeral home in Dallas when that happened in 1963. But all of this is beyond
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.800]  Lee Harvey Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby at the Dallas police station where the cops
[27:24.800 --> 27:30.240]  walking out, hold him up so he can get shot. And they have done this in front of God, in
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.600]  front of country, in front of the whole world. But in the backdrop, they had sold us out
[27:35.600 --> 27:39.960]  of the chai comms the Clintons had. And so now the chai comms are cut off predominantly
[27:39.960 --> 27:44.160]  from the US government. They're trying to run Hollywood and their stay behind networks,
[27:44.160 --> 27:49.440]  the Democratic Party, Antifa, their Confucius institutes. But more and more, they're losing
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.720]  ground. They're losing control. So they're beginning to panic. And now you're seeing
[27:54.720 --> 28:00.160]  absolute desperation. A lot of people are looking at photos of Epstein and we're supposedly
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.200]  on the stretcher and saying, oh, that's clearly taken from another photo. It's been photo
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.760]  shopped. Who knows what's true. We've all been lied to so much that it's reasonable to say
[28:08.760 --> 28:13.840]  he's still alive. No, it is protection program. It's reasonable to say he was, you know, murdered
[28:13.840 --> 28:22.600]  a very suspicious to say he was suicided because they all stood down. And every default option,
[28:22.600 --> 28:29.000]  every standing operating procedure was turned off. All these switches were turned off to
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.480]  let this happen. I had a gut level. Oh, and I'll ask you what you think we come back.
[28:32.480 --> 28:37.040]  I think that he probably is dead because dead men tell no tales. Plus it sends a message
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.880]  to everybody else. Keep your mouth shut. Make no mistake. Wickening is here. Things are
[28:41.880 --> 28:46.000]  only to get patient from this point on. And info wars was supposed to be off the air by
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.920]  now. You're the listeners of yours. That's alive. You are the info war. You are the resistance.
[28:50.920 --> 29:01.880]  I think you all stay with us. We'll be right back. Heart disease is on the rise clogged
[29:01.880 --> 29:07.040]  arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you. The
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.720]  symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular
[29:12.720 --> 29:17.160]  heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Hear how
[29:17.160 --> 29:22.680]  heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:22.680 --> 29:27.320]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling
[29:27.320 --> 29:31.600]  me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend
[29:31.600 --> 29:36.160]  heart and body extract to everyone. Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should
[29:36.160 --> 29:41.360]  be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[30:01.120 --> 30:05.120]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I decided that we're
[30:05.120 --> 30:09.000]  gonna kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five, six years ago before
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.400]  all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how
[30:12.400 --> 30:16.000]  great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.840]  on an expert to explain why they were so good. And instead the last few years I'm like, hey,
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.840]  we need to really support us or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing people like to
[30:22.840 --> 30:25.760]  buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were. And
[30:25.760 --> 30:31.000]  the left always has headlines everywhere. Joan sells unapproved supplements. He claims
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.360]  they're supplements. No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement
[30:36.360 --> 30:39.760]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.120]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[30:44.120 --> 30:47.800]  to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things. And a lot of drugs
[30:47.800 --> 30:51.720]  work great. They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want
[30:51.720 --> 30:58.160]  you knowing about God's medicine chest. Infoorstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three,
[30:58.160 --> 31:04.160]  one, three, nine. I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[31:04.160 --> 31:08.600]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you. We run during the
[31:08.600 --> 31:14.080]  breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't
[31:14.080 --> 31:18.400]  want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line. We're barely
[31:18.400 --> 31:22.200]  paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalists not contract. I
[31:22.200 --> 31:27.680]  don't want them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We saw enough product.
[31:27.680 --> 31:31.680]  We'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run
[31:31.680 --> 31:36.280]  for their money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2.

[33:04.040 --> 33:17.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming
[33:17.680 --> 33:22.040]  to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[33:22.040 --> 33:29.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Monday edition. I'm Alex Jones,
[33:29.520 --> 33:35.880]  here with you from San Diego, California. Troyer is in the main studios in the ATX.
[33:35.880 --> 33:39.880]  And of course, again, we have Bob Barnes joining us at the start of the next hour. Then we
[33:39.880 --> 33:44.760]  have an amazing reporter from Right Bar who I was familiar with, but I heard him on the
[33:44.760 --> 33:50.400]  airing our stay on a Sunday show with Tom Papert. He knows more about this stuff than
[33:50.400 --> 33:56.000]  I do because it's his beat. And so I've learned all this stuff about Epstein, but I forget
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.640]  about a lot of it because I'm covering everything. He mainly covers this, and you could have
[34:00.640 --> 34:04.080]  a better guess than that gentleman that's coming up.
[34:04.080 --> 34:09.240]  Then we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson. And I do want to open the phones up. Watson's
[34:09.240 --> 34:12.640]  only on for two segments at the start of the third hour. We should really just open the
[34:12.640 --> 34:18.320]  phones up after that and then go into the second part of that into the fourth hour because
[34:18.320 --> 34:23.120]  Watson's not hosting the fourth hour today. He's doing that Wednesday. But regardless,
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.360]  you really do need to open the phones up and get the callers take on all of this because
[34:27.360 --> 34:32.080]  this is something that I know no one that we're talking to and no one I even see in
[34:32.080 --> 34:38.640]  the media is buying this and the attorney general is not buying it. And Al Green of Texas didn't
[34:38.640 --> 34:44.920]  buy it. As Al Green said, he said, listen, if there isn't video of this, there's supposed
[34:44.920 --> 34:49.280]  to be video on those cells, you know, there's a cover up. Well, guess what? There's no video.
[34:49.280 --> 34:56.040]  And it just goes on and on and on. So this is the big awakening. There's been lots of
[34:56.040 --> 35:03.720]  steps on this path, but this broke the back. This just went way too far. And now, now they've
[35:03.720 --> 35:08.960]  gone completely insane saying, oh, the video cameras were turned off. The jail guards were
[35:08.960 --> 35:12.720]  told don't check his room every 30 minutes, even though all jail cells are checked every
[35:12.720 --> 35:21.800]  30 minutes. It goes further than that. Now, the famous JFK coroner has been pulled out
[35:21.800 --> 35:27.300]  of monthballs that put out the ridiculous garbage that JFK had only been shot the number
[35:27.300 --> 35:31.720]  of times they said when his brain had been blown out the back of his head. And the original
[35:31.720 --> 35:40.000]  coroner reports and all of it said that I've even interviewed his mortician JFK's mortician
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.040]  of even interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald's mortician. I mean, we've just had him all on the show.
[35:47.040 --> 35:51.160]  And Jim Mars, God bless his soul, who interviewed all the experts. He was the guy that kept
[35:51.160 --> 35:55.760]  getting me all those great guests. And now they've done something. I'd say this is Kennedy
[35:55.760 --> 36:01.200]  assassination cover up to the next level. I mean, this is squared. This is like a Richter
[36:01.200 --> 36:09.480]  scale where every point on the Richter scale is an entire power of magnitude stronger. And
[36:09.480 --> 36:17.680]  so a whole point on the Richter scale is 10 times that. I mean, this is just seismic,
[36:17.680 --> 36:25.840]  insane, crazy. What are they doing? And then it gets worse after all of that all over the
[36:25.840 --> 36:31.840]  world from France to England to Germany to Israel. Criminal investigations are being opened
[36:31.840 --> 36:41.720]  because Jeffrey Epstein was an industrial level procured of young women for rich, powerful
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.480]  men. He started out doing it at a very, very young age. Didn't even have the college degree,
[36:47.480 --> 36:53.320]  but was allowed to teach an elite school where they were corrupting the children. That's
[36:53.320 --> 36:59.920]  all come out. And then he began to procure hundreds of girls a year by the 80s. Then
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.880]  thousands of girls a year reportedly, and he had, again, children being smuggled in
[37:04.880 --> 37:11.640]  even younger than 12 or 13 by smugglers to the Caribbean Island, running them up to
[37:11.640 --> 37:15.960]  the buildings, getting them in. And believe me, from our Intel, and I talked about this
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.480]  10 years ago, those about the island, nobody else would. They weren't just having sex
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.880]  for them down in those tombs and down in those dungeons. Let me tell you, that's just the
[37:24.880 --> 37:30.880]  entry level in the club is you have sex with underage people, then it's sex with children,
[37:30.880 --> 37:35.480]  and then it's kill them dead in a hammer. This is vampirism. And again, this is coming
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.540]  to you from the folks that first broken on a big scale. I was told this by high level
[37:40.540 --> 37:49.080]  retired FBI agents, by what is it, one or three star generals, major generals. The whole
[37:49.080 --> 37:57.480]  point is, is that, is that I used to hear this 25 years ago from at conferences I would
[37:57.480 --> 38:00.600]  go to, and when I had these people on the air, when I'd go, she's going to give a speech
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.520]  and I'd, then they'd call me and say, let's go get dinner. And they'd tell me, well, you
[38:04.520 --> 38:09.760]  know, the Satanists are really run the communists and, but the public can't handle it and they're
[38:09.760 --> 38:13.560]  using this to corrupt and take over. And then it's just all coming out. It's all true.
[38:13.560 --> 38:20.400]  Okay. So I understand why people can't believe this. I understand why people can't deal
[38:20.400 --> 38:27.160]  with it. I understand all of that. When I learned that Peter sacrifices dogs on the
[38:27.160 --> 38:34.680]  upper story of their building, I thought that the person that told me was crazy. But guess
[38:34.680 --> 38:39.800]  what? It wasn't crazy. It was true. Okay. And I'm not going to get into all that for
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.120]  personal reasons, but it's very, very personal. It's been in the news. What I told people
[38:44.120 --> 38:48.560]  over a decade ago has been confirmed. But I thought that this, that this person that
[38:48.560 --> 38:55.920]  I knew had gone crazy. I didn't believe it until we got called by private investigators
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.000]  and a regular republishing and others. And they said, do you know who this person is
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.720]  in your family? And I said, no, I do not know this. And they said, well, you better ask
[39:05.720 --> 39:11.840]  them. And I asked, and it was, and it was like, yeah, and it's terrible. And that's
[39:11.840 --> 39:17.080]  why they got out of it. But I mean, you hear this stuff from former head FBI agent over
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.120]  the LA sector or from a three-star general, where you hear it from these people over and
[39:21.120 --> 39:28.240]  over again. And then you find out how close it is even to you, just some weird PETA spinoff
[39:28.240 --> 39:33.640]  of it, of them making all the PETA employees go out to animal shelters and get dogs and
[39:33.640 --> 39:38.600]  cats so they can like get off on injecting them and killing them and then throwing them
[39:38.600 --> 39:43.040]  in trash cans and mass. And again, I'm just telling you this because this is how insane
[39:43.040 --> 39:50.480]  these people are. Dr. Peter Singer, that's the head of PETA, the main advisor of it over
[39:50.480 --> 39:55.600]  Ingrid Newhouse or whatever her name is. He says kill babies up to age three. He wrote
[39:55.600 --> 40:01.680]  that 30 years ago. Now the left, it says that to us on camera when we go to their events,
[40:01.680 --> 40:07.640]  people, women in business suits and clothes walk up and go, I am full wars. We're gonna
[40:07.640 --> 40:13.720]  kill babies up to age three. You have to understand folks that I understand why none of this sounds
[40:13.720 --> 40:19.200]  real. None of this sounds possible because I never get sick of iced tea and the enchiladas
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.880]  I had last night. I never get sick of, you know, my wife. I would never even want to
[40:24.880 --> 40:30.480]  hurt a child. I would never want to go do stuff that I guess the Pope's talked about
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.760]  that he thinks about all the time, eating feces and things. But you understand these
[40:35.760 --> 40:42.400]  people and the spirits that are in them want to degrade date the human spirit. These people
[40:42.400 --> 40:47.680]  want to pull down the human spirit dimensionally so that we don't go with God. It's a ritual.
[40:47.680 --> 40:52.720]  And again, I go back to this allegory, which is perfect. Eddie Murphy's good film, the
[40:52.720 --> 41:00.460]  golden child, the Satanists are in LA sacrificing children to torture them so that the blood
[41:00.460 --> 41:04.560]  is corrupt. Then they put the blood of tortured children in the oatmeal to try to get the
[41:04.560 --> 41:11.000]  golden child who symbolizes humanity's ascension in a more new agey way. It's Christ figure
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.800]  because they're unable to physically kill him until they've corrupted his body. So that's
[41:15.800 --> 41:21.680]  what the 5G and the GMO and the vaccines and all the stuff on TV and the, you know, the
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.920]  cigarette additives and all the liquor and all the drugs and all the prozac and all of
[41:26.920 --> 41:34.360]  it is meant to enslave us and bind us down and control us. So Jeffrey Epstein is key
[41:34.360 --> 41:40.160]  because he was a pimp and a procurer and a frontman, a concierge. In fact, Epstein was
[41:40.160 --> 41:47.360]  a concierge of trauma-based mind control, of Satanism and of corruption. And the Clintons
[41:47.360 --> 41:57.440]  where Renfield managers above him just look at them for the royalty, for the most powerful
[41:57.440 --> 42:03.480]  families in the world, who I will assure you, ladies and gentlemen, are not just having
[42:03.480 --> 42:08.320]  sex with underage girls. And you go to England and you find Jimmy Savelle and all the dead
[42:08.320 --> 42:12.640]  kids and the dungeons and all the murdered children. And they would walk in in front
[42:12.640 --> 42:17.600]  of certain prime ministers with little girls and put plastic on the floor, seven-year-olds
[42:17.600 --> 42:22.120]  was his favorite, slit their throat. And I'm not going to even tell you what would go on
[42:22.120 --> 42:27.680]  from that point, but you have to understand that the angel of death, Joseph Mengele wrote
[42:27.680 --> 42:31.640]  in his own diary. He was from German royalty. He would just go pick out a bunch of little
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.480]  five-year-old kids at a concentration camp. That was his favorite. He'd know a bunch of
[42:35.480 --> 42:39.520]  chocolates for whatever reason. Then he'd drive them out in the field itself and just
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.640]  shoot them in the head every morning. This has got the profit of just draining their
[42:43.640 --> 42:48.400]  energy to serve vampires. We ride back, break down, have a whole house of cards, and come
[42:48.400 --> 42:54.480]  down if you want it to, infowars.com, twoswits.com. Tomorrow's news today. I'll enjoy your ride
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.000]  shotgun. Spread the word about the transmission. The globals hope you won't.
[43:00.000 --> 43:03.960]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[43:03.960 --> 43:08.320]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[43:08.320 --> 43:12.160]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy. That's not backed
[43:12.160 --> 43:16.400]  by some billionaire. That's not being funded by a secret foreign government. It is completely
[43:16.400 --> 43:22.080]  independent of all that. It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.200]  of the freedom of press and freedom of speech. That, in fact, the founders were so concerned
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.600]  with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations
[43:30.600 --> 43:34.040]  just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted. And then ultimately we
[43:34.040 --> 43:38.120]  now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaires
[43:38.120 --> 43:42.600]  sugar daddies who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the persons
[43:42.600 --> 43:47.560]  allowed to have or express or hear. And the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[43:47.560 --> 43:51.920]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[43:51.920 --> 43:56.600]  freedom. And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation,
[43:56.600 --> 44:26.400]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.880]  And now it is a revolutionary act at the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[44:30.880 --> 44:36.520]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag. And particularly
[44:36.520 --> 44:42.400]  when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com. So
[44:42.400 --> 44:47.640]  whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.560]  over not just the U.S. but worldwide because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol
[44:51.560 --> 45:00.440]  of freedom against globalism.
[45:00.440 --> 45:06.360]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[45:06.360 --> 45:10.760]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[45:10.760 --> 45:14.560]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today, the communist
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.240]  Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[45:20.240 --> 45:25.320]  in polls to support for the president. And what he's doing in this trade war, once China
[45:25.320 --> 45:30.160]  put pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied. And
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.040]  we aren't going to back down. So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world
[45:35.040 --> 45:39.080]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[45:39.080 --> 45:44.560]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at infowars.com and
[45:44.560 --> 45:50.120]  newswords.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.120]  the light, the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.

[46:39.160 --> 46:43.120]  of your barn. Every time you stand up to leftist bullies, every time you tell the truth, every
[46:43.120 --> 46:48.720]  time you keep the symbol of free speech and pro human values alive, the enemy comes one
[46:48.720 --> 46:53.240]  step closer to their system falling. We have pushed them into overreaching and showing
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.640]  their hand. And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist.
[46:57.640 --> 47:21.240]  Stay with us. We'll be right back. But please take advantage of the sale.
[47:21.240 --> 47:24.840]  What is Jeffrey Epstein's greatest secret? It's not just that he was an international
[47:24.840 --> 47:31.000]  procurer of underage girls or children so they could blackmail world leaders for a corporate
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.600]  worldwide government system. That's all been confirmed. No, ladies and gentlemen, it's
[47:36.600 --> 47:43.960]  the ultimate taboo at every civilization in its declining, waning, twilight days engages
[47:43.960 --> 47:53.240]  in. Human sacrifice of children. No, vampires that live for thousands of years aren't real.
[47:53.240 --> 48:01.800]  But the spirits that fill these husks, these servants of evil do, they're eternal. And
[48:01.800 --> 48:06.920]  that's where you get the legend of the vampire and they are kidnapping and torturing children.
[48:06.920 --> 48:11.920]  And some they turn into minions and servants. And that's a lot of the rim field types that
[48:11.920 --> 48:16.520]  you actually see like the Hillary's and the bills. They themselves have been abused. And
[48:16.520 --> 48:20.620]  of course, you know, both of them have been abused, but they decided they love the dark
[48:20.620 --> 48:27.160]  side and drank deeply from it. So that's Jeffrey Epstein's big secret. And it could bring down
[48:27.160 --> 48:31.560]  the whole system. It could bring down the whole house of cards if it continues to roll
[48:31.560 --> 48:35.360]  up the witnesses and the individuals and all these documents that came out last week confirmed
[48:35.360 --> 48:41.000]  we have an expert on this coming up in about 40 minutes after Robert Barnes comes on. All
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.440]  of this confirms, ladies and gentlemen, that Bill Clinton was on the island and lied about
[48:46.440 --> 48:51.880]  it. And the island again has the underground temples, the dungeons, all of this is coming
[48:51.880 --> 49:00.040]  out and Epstein is only one manager of a whole network of these facilities. That's why these
[49:00.040 --> 49:06.480]  are all big compounds. And while on the islands, they have these big women's retreats and
[49:06.480 --> 49:13.160]  Disney Cruises would stop at the island, look that up. Can't make that up. And other events
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.720]  will go on at his huge New Mexico compound that's set up like a college. Just like Penn
[49:18.720 --> 49:25.960]  State had this big organization run by Sandusky and they would bring abused children who'd
[49:25.960 --> 49:33.360]  already been raped. Some as young as seven because if they did medical exams on them,
[49:33.360 --> 49:36.520]  they couldn't tell who'd raped them because they've already been raped. So they would
[49:36.520 --> 49:41.600]  bring rape victims to Sandusky by the hundreds a year. And then they would have high-powered
[49:41.600 --> 49:49.400]  donors come and mentor them and stay at good size mansions with the children sometimes
[49:49.400 --> 49:55.560]  for weeks. And so it's just the renting out of children. But everybody in the power structure
[49:55.560 --> 50:00.480]  wants to social climb. So they go and have sex with the kids to be in the club, but then
[50:00.480 --> 50:06.600]  they get recruited to the next level. And again, it's just like Eyes Wide Shut. You
[50:06.600 --> 50:13.560]  get taken to it. There's a woman in the ritual. She dies. Oh, it's an overdose. You're now
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.880]  involved in murdering somebody. Oh, don't worry. She's just a hooker. That's it's a
[50:18.880 --> 50:23.800]  15-year-old boy. And this is the, this is the, when you look in the eyes, these people,
[50:23.800 --> 50:30.400]  they look so psychotic. They look so evil. Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Jeffrey Epstein.
[50:30.400 --> 50:34.000]  When you look in the eyes of the Democratic Party and why they look so evil and why they're
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.040]  so bad because they've all taken part at least in the cover-up of the abuse. CNN, MSNBC,
[50:41.040 --> 50:46.840]  The New York Times, all of them, they are complicit in demonizing and attacking anybody
[50:46.840 --> 50:52.440]  that talks about it, in creating fake stories. That was mainstream news. Diverting us off
[50:52.440 --> 51:00.240]  to the pizza parlor in D.C. away from the spirit cooking and all the proof. And the
[51:00.240 --> 51:08.480]  brother of John Podesta, Tony Podesta in the Washington Post in 2007, saying, I've got
[51:08.480 --> 51:13.240]  child porn. I've got a dungeon I watch videos in. I'll do what I want. I'm not going to
[51:13.240 --> 51:17.400]  even show you the photos of that. It's child porn. They put in the Washington Post to throw
[51:17.400 --> 51:22.160]  it in your face to get you used to it. And you look at Tony Podesta, he looks more like
[51:22.160 --> 51:28.360]  a demon. He could be in a Ghostbusters movie as a goblin. It's all, because that's the
[51:28.360 --> 51:33.480]  spirit that's in them. When you do things like this, it turns you over to them. Images
[51:33.480 --> 51:38.280]  of children hanging off meat hooks in big shower dungeon areas where you hose their
[51:38.280 --> 51:47.040]  guts off when you're done. These are absolute savage individuals just full of pure evil.
[51:47.040 --> 51:51.000]  When they're on those stages with university professors, they're on those stages on CNN
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.920]  and the other sickos are bowing to them. They are bowing to them saying, I want to be deeper
[51:55.920 --> 52:01.600]  in the cult. I want to come. I want to have the walnut sauce. I want to be part of it.
[52:01.600 --> 52:07.080]  I want to be in the pool with the kids. I want to on and on and on. When you look at any
[52:07.080 --> 52:11.200]  of these people, they know what they're part of. So the biggest takeaway is this media
[52:11.200 --> 52:17.120]  complex aren't just liars, folks. They love it. They love saying kill millions of people
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.240]  for the new world order. They love overthrowing Libya and destabilizing all of Africa. They
[52:21.240 --> 52:26.240]  love destroying stable governments and bringing in evil. They are a legion of evil. Owen Troyer,
[52:26.240 --> 52:33.680]  I have to tell you, getting on the plane. I talked about this Sunday. People were all
[52:33.680 --> 52:36.640]  saying, Hey, you hear Epstein died. Alex is incredible. They murdered him because we just
[52:36.640 --> 52:40.440]  got in the news before we got on the plane. I shot a video before we got on the plane.
[52:40.440 --> 52:45.280]  And Democrats were going good. Hillary needs to be tough so that people fear her. Trump
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.680]  doesn't have any respect. Good. I'm glad Epstein's dead. And there were Democrats. A lot of them,
[52:49.680 --> 52:54.880]  you know, clean cut older, dressed nice husbands and wives just looking at me, just nodding,
[52:54.880 --> 53:02.480]  going like they were feeling powerful. They had taken the devil spirit, not the Holy Spirit,
[53:02.480 --> 53:07.720]  but they taken communion. You see, and I had him out here by the pool a couple of days
[53:07.720 --> 53:12.760]  ago. I'm swimming with my daughter and my security guy had just walked off. I said,
[53:12.760 --> 53:16.480]  Yeah, go tell the other security guy he can have off. I'm about to go up. And he goes,
[53:16.480 --> 53:21.800]  Okay, sure. He walks off. They're watching and five yuppies, three women, two men come
[53:21.800 --> 53:25.960]  over while I'm in the pool in front of my daughter and say, we hope you commit suicide,
[53:25.960 --> 53:31.040]  kill yourself. I hope you die. You know, just, just, just all this insane. And they were
[53:31.040 --> 53:37.960]  just going, I mean, just, just because I'm telling you, they've fully taken the spirit.
[53:37.960 --> 53:42.840]  They've converted. Anybody's got to go to a Democrat event folks. And these people literally
[53:42.840 --> 53:50.400]  walk around, yes, they have something's happened to them. Oh, and Shroyer, this is huge. What
[53:50.400 --> 53:54.680]  do you think's happening? Well, Alex, if you recall, before you took
[53:54.680 --> 53:58.200]  off or before we left here on Friday, you know, we don't have enough time to run around
[53:58.200 --> 54:02.200]  working all the time. We had kind of a personal conversation. I said, you know, Alex, every
[54:02.200 --> 54:06.200]  time you try to get away, something crazy happens. And then sure enough, right before
[54:06.200 --> 54:11.760]  your plane takes off, Jeffrey Epstein is murdered. And then, you know, as far as Epstein is concerned,
[54:11.760 --> 54:15.360]  I think there's really only two logical conclusions that we can reach right now, Alex. And that
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.640]  was that Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, very powerful forces involved, or he's alive and
[54:20.640 --> 54:24.720]  he was taken out of jail and put into witness protection because of the threats against his
[54:24.720 --> 54:28.520]  life. I think that those are the only two reasonable options right now, Alex. And anybody
[54:28.520 --> 54:32.800]  who thinks he was, or anybody who thinks he committed suicide and believes this narrative
[54:32.800 --> 54:36.920]  that they're putting out there, which I don't really see anybody except writers for the New
[54:36.920 --> 54:43.560]  York Times and the Washington Post, you know, or commentators at MSNBC or CNN or big globalist
[54:43.560 --> 54:48.400]  news organizations like ABC News and Yahoo. Other than that, it seems like the average
[54:48.400 --> 54:52.680]  American, you know, anybody in media that has any soul left at all is saying, no, this
[54:52.680 --> 54:56.600]  is, this is a cover up. They're lying about what happened. He definitely didn't commit
[54:56.600 --> 55:02.640]  suicide, but that's not going to stop the Tokyo Rose Baghdad Bob propaganda mockingbird
[55:02.640 --> 55:08.760]  media from continuing to tell us, oh, it's just a suicide, nothing to see here. So we'll
[55:08.760 --> 55:12.160]  see if there's any answer. I totally agree with you. And I'll tell you this, oh, and
[55:12.160 --> 55:15.440]  you know, I lean towards, they really killed him because dead men tell no tales. They want
[55:15.440 --> 55:19.960]  to send a message, but they're so bold and crazy hiring JFK's coroner that, you know,
[55:19.960 --> 55:25.120]  clearly put out that whole fake report and they've turned the cameras off and told the
[55:25.120 --> 55:29.080]  guards to go home early that they probably did just take him out the back of the building
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.600]  and then photoshop and image him on the stretcher. I mean, they'll do anything now. Oh, and
[55:33.600 --> 55:36.720]  why do you think they're doing that? I think it's because the wheels are coming off and
[55:36.720 --> 55:38.040]  they're losing control.
[55:38.040 --> 55:43.600]  Well, I think the reason is they see that the public is finally, I mean, the Renaissance
[55:43.600 --> 55:48.840]  is happening. That's really what this is about. And so this isn't going to work though. Trying
[55:48.840 --> 55:52.720]  to tell the world that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, the Renaissance isn't believing anymore.
[55:52.720 --> 55:56.120]  People are awake. They see that this is going on. I mean, they don't believe it because
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.320]  they turned the cameras off because he was on death watch and they took him off of it.
[56:00.320 --> 56:03.360]  Then they put him a cell alone. They weren't supposed to do that. And then now they're
[56:03.360 --> 56:08.360]  delaying the coroner's report. And then it just goes on and on and on. And it's the day
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.320]  after these bombshell documents get exclusively at first released here at info wars.com. In
[56:13.320 --> 56:17.840]  fact, let me just say that because I always forget, folks, we want to hire more reporters.
[56:17.840 --> 56:21.720]  We want to expand. We're just trusting in God and trusting in you and moving forward
[56:21.720 --> 56:29.040]  with the expansion. We're working seven days a week here, but we had to end the sale yesterday
[56:29.040 --> 56:32.400]  because a bunch of stuff is selling out. But I've been so busy with the news, we haven't
[56:32.400 --> 56:35.480]  come up with the new sale yet. This is the way you can take advantage of these sales
[56:35.480 --> 56:42.800]  when they get extended because this sale has, we've had to sell this big sense of Christmas.
[56:42.800 --> 56:48.640]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50 to 60% off. And that's how we find the
[56:48.640 --> 56:53.920]  operation. The storeable foods are still 50% off. We sold out of the Alexa pure pro. We're
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.160]  about to sell out of the Alexa pure breeze. We're about to sell out of their pitchers,
[56:58.160 --> 57:02.000]  little pitcher ones that are good as well. We're selling out of a lot of these products.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.200]  You've been sold out for three months of the strongest, best krill oil we could find at
[57:06.200 --> 57:10.840]  the cleanest krill oil. It's finally back in. People are big fans of it. It's 50% off
[57:10.840 --> 57:14.360]  despite that, but I'm going to have to end that sale and probably a week or so. That's
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.360]  going to be one of the things we're going to extend is the krill oil, but it really
[57:18.360 --> 57:23.520]  is high quality krill oil. What it does for your brain, your body's amazing. M4warstore.com.

[57:45.680 --> 57:51.960]  finish up when we come back on the other side. If you want to bet on your future, if you
[57:51.960 --> 57:56.680]  want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the chai comms with Senate
[57:56.680 --> 58:01.360]  and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats and MSM and CNN, the Chinese
[58:01.360 --> 58:04.640]  government does. It's all coming out. Democrats aren't going to stop. They're trying to cause
[58:04.640 --> 58:07.800]  a civil war right now. Like we're starting to get some purchase, trying to start a fire.
[58:07.800 --> 58:11.760]  They got some fire going. All the physical attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities
[58:11.760 --> 58:15.960]  hitting attack, dead people everywhere. It's on folks. And if you think it's bad now, if
[58:15.960 --> 58:19.240]  they really get traction, it's going to go insane. So now more than you've ever done
[58:19.240 --> 58:22.760]  for yourself, for me, for everybody, spread the word about this broadcast on your local

[59:53.520 --> 1:00:19.760]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the information war, it's
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:28.240]  Alex Jones. Here's Al Green. He's got questions. I kind of like the fact that Al Green knows
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:32.280]  that nobody's buying the official story and finally even broken clocks are right twice
[1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:35.960]  a day. Here's the Texas Congress from the once Trump impeached saying there better be
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:40.080]  video of this release it. Well, guess what, Al Green? They turned the video cameras off,
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:48.760]  buddy. Welcome to the real world to happen. Impossible. When the impossible occurs, we
[1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:55.040]  have to act with immediacy. We need to see the video immediately. And if the video doesn't
[1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:01.760]  show us what it should and there's some technology that failed, Mr. Cavuto, we cannot allow ourselves
[1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:08.520]  to believe absurdities because it will cause us to allow atrocities to be committed. We
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:14.040]  have to see what happened. What are you saying? Do you think someone killed it? I don't know
[1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:19.040]  what happened. That's why we have to find out right away. And we also need to see if
[1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:23.760]  there's a video of those who were watching him, who are monitoring him. We need to see
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:30.680]  that video. This is not supposed to happen. We have to know immediately what occurred.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:38.240]  And I thank you for giving me that. No, it is very strange. It doesn't add up. But now
[1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:44.200]  the video cameras were turned off, Owen. Now they're hiring the JFK cover-up artist that
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:48.440]  did the whole fake report on the magic bullets and all that and the autopsy. I mean, this
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:56.200]  is getting absolutely ridiculous, Owen. Well, I'm not sure how much I take into the new
[1:01:56.200 --> 1:02:00.520]  guy, the famous Dr. Michael Baden being involved in this. He's pretty much involved with every
[1:02:00.520 --> 1:02:04.840]  high-profile autopsy and there was already an autopsy done. The suspicious thing is as
[1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:10.600]  why is it being held back right now? The family requested that Baden get involved. But Alex,
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:15.280]  here's my thing. And listening to Al Green, they've cooked their own goose here because
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.600]  they tried to turn Epstein Trump into the thing and they tried to flip the Clinton body
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:25.040]  count to the Trump body count on social media. So now all of their vitriolic foaming at the
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:29.480]  mouth Trump haters are demanding answers into Epstein's death because they essentially
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:35.240]  think it's going to bring down Trump. So now you have clearly now Al Green is just sorry
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:38.760]  to say just a low IQ congressman because he goes out and says Trump is racist and all
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:42.240]  this crap and you're like, wow, you must be blackmail. There's some agent. But now he
[1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:46.240]  comes out this, he just buys it. He just genuinely buys all right, let's go further. Let's go
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:51.440]  further. You just hit something key. We've been exposing Epstein for 10 years and 20
[1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:58.280]  years before that, this whole globalist pedophile frame up blackmail network. But it was Democrats
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:02.160]  suppressing all of our real news about it, but putting out fake stuff about Trump and
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:07.560]  Epstein that kept it going, that then got all these lawsuits going, because people wanted
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:11.320]  to defend themselves that now has brought out all the proof on the Clintons. And they're
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.440]  too stupid to ever think two or three steps ahead. And so now just like you said, they
[1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:19.840]  suppressed Clinton body count so that everybody pushes Trump body count. But then all they
[1:03:19.840 --> 1:03:25.680]  find is the truth about the Clintons. This is all completely blowing up in their face.
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:31.400]  And here's what's coming next because I think Lisa Bloom and Gloria Alred are too. I'm not
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.800]  a fan of their politics, but they're pretty much, you know, they smell red meat, they
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:35.800]  smell blood in the water.
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:39.960]  So they're going to go after it for these victims. And now they're going after Giselle
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:46.160]  Maxwell and all signs point to she wants to cooperate before they suicide her. But Alex,
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:50.280]  I want to get your final comments on this because this is where it all goes. You basically
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:03:53.760]  turned into the most credible person in media overnight. You basically turned from a conspiracy
[1:03:53.760 --> 1:03:58.920]  theorist to a biblical prophet overnight. But this story is in the mirror inside Orgy Island
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:04.360]  where aristocrat sex parties eventually ended in murder. This comes out of Island by Italy.
[1:04:04.360 --> 1:04:08.200]  This is what is going on or was going on at Epstein Island. And if it all comes out, this
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:10.520]  is what people are going to find out, Alex.
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:16.000]  Well, I mean, I know they kill people on these islands. And so you're telling me it's in
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.880]  major news now that they're now talking about murdering people.
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:23.720]  Yeah, this came out August 9th over the weekend, Zanoni, which sits off the West Coast of
[1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:27.720]  Italy between Naples and Rome was owned by an aristocrat and his wife. And they had all
[1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:33.360]  these sex orgies and it documents in here how many of it ended in murder.
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:38.560]  Well, yeah, and that's what I said last segment is that they're they have these groups all
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:39.560]  over the world. They're doing it.
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:45.080]  It's Eyes Wide Shut, Alex. It's a Rosemary's baby or whatever.
[1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:49.040]  Look, I've been told by a lot of high level Hollywood people, and I'll leave it at that,
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:54.000]  as high level as you can get, that this stuff's all real and that Eyes Wide Shut is a documentary.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.520]  I basically, Cooper's daughter told me it's a documentary.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:05.040]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:10.600]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:17.960]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes
[1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:23.960]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The
[1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:30.080]  system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:36.440]  be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[1:05:36.440 --> 1:05:41.960]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:48.040]  or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity

[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:16.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:23.480]  It's Monday, August 12, 2019. I'm Alex Jones on the road. Owen Schroder is taking over
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:30.400]  right now with our great legal head counsel, Robert Barnes, who knows the inside baseball
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:37.480]  on all of this stuff. And he has privately told me about some of the lawyers and groups
[1:06:37.480 --> 1:06:44.840]  out there that get women's cases and then scuttle them claiming that they're advocates
[1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:50.640]  for women because in this whole new Epstein assassination or witness protection program
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:55.960]  or whatever really happened, saga that nobody's buying and this huge awakening for the world.
[1:06:55.960 --> 1:07:01.440]  This is one of the biggest ever. We have to ask, what's the next phase of the cover-up
[1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:06.920]  as it comes out that these orgy islands are all over the world as Owen was just covering
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:11.320]  and that they are actually killing people in rituals at these? I remember reading that
[1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:17.200]  in The London Guardian 25 years ago about they found a Rothschild Castle in France with
[1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:21.240]  all these dead women and women still alive in cages and then it all disappeared out of
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:28.760]  the news. This is the hunger folks. This is the occultism and this is international spiring,
[1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:32.520]  but how are they going to try to cover it up? I'm not going to name names. Barnes could
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:37.420]  go as far as he wants, but these women that are victims and are in these documents and
[1:07:37.420 --> 1:07:42.360]  proving the Clintons and all of this were there, how far is it going to go? How big
[1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:48.000]  is it? And historically, Robert Barnes, as I hand you and Owen the baton, a gut level,
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.920]  how would you characterize this moment in the world when the whole case is falling apart?
[1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:58.280]  They're hiring the famous JFK coroners, they're turning the cameras off, the jail guards aren't
[1:07:58.280 --> 1:08:02.520]  supposed to even do their normal job every 30 minutes. I think they probably killed him
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:06.160]  because dead men tell no tales and it's a message to others, but who knows? All we know
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:11.000]  is questioning is the American way. I'm being sued, as you know, you represent me for questioning
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.800]  events. Robert Barnes takeover, we're all eagerly listening.
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:20.360]  I mean, it's extraordinary. I mean, the way I see it currently is that what you see with
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:24.560]  the Epstein death is almost the equivalent to what happened with Lee Harvey Oswald getting
[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:30.600]  shot by Jack Ruby, that at the moment that happened for the world to see, the world awoke
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:36.040]  to a different reality. They started to understand that things were not as they had, the 1950s
[1:08:36.040 --> 1:08:40.880]  civics, a book version of America wasn't the actual America they believed it was. There
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.920]  was something clearly AWOL, there was something clearly amiss. And that is definitely the
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:49.960]  case here. For example, I do a lot of cases involving people that are in federal detention.
[1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:54.400]  I also do a lot of civil rights cases involving people who are mistreated in various state
[1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:59.320]  and federal facilities. So I have intricate knowledge of how these facilities operate.
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:03.720]  In the Bureau of Prisons, ever since the early 2000s when they imposed a wide range of protective
[1:09:03.720 --> 1:09:11.320]  procedures and protocols, it is near impossible to commit suicide. It is very, very difficult.
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:15.400]  And it's very difficult for multiple reasons. First, they design and structure the physical
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:20.440]  cell to not have the physical means for a person to commit suicide. As the New York Post
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:26.160]  published yesterday, recent inmates in the exact same cell that Epstein was in said they
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.480]  can't conceive of how he could have possibly done it, how he could have possibly committed
[1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:36.240]  suicide in the cell. So that's step one. So even if you somehow get past that, you then
[1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:41.720]  by the way, I would note that nobody has put out exactly how it is he died. They just said
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:46.240]  a parent suicide. They didn't say they found him hanging. And the reason a lot of people
[1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:49.840]  had doubts about that is there didn't appear to be any means to hang yourself inside that
[1:09:49.840 --> 1:09:54.520]  cell. They were saying, oh, he could have used his sheets. The sheets are paper. They
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:59.480]  deliberately structure every physical thing in that cell to make it almost impossible
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:05.120]  to commit suicide. In fact, nobody can remember the last time a suicide happened at MCC in
[1:10:05.120 --> 1:10:10.000]  Manhattan. The estimate is that the last time it happened was 44 years ago. To give you
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:14.640]  an idea, the Bureau of Prisons has a lower suicide rate. Despite having a much higher
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:20.800]  risk profile of an inmate for mental health issues and suicidal risk, then does the population
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:26.040]  as a whole. That's how low the suicide risk is. And the reason for that, in first part,
[1:10:26.040 --> 1:10:30.680]  and primary reason is these, the cells themselves are structured. So it's very difficult to
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:35.240]  commit suicide. But the second is all the observation that takes place. First, you have
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:40.200]  your observation by the other person who's a fellow inmate in the jail cell with you.
[1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:45.680]  The next is that you have observation by video observation on your cell with a camera on
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:51.120]  it 24 seven. The next level of observation is that the guards are either making 15 minute
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:55.520]  or 30 minute walk bys and usually they're doing it randomly. So you don't know it will
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.160]  be at least every 30 minutes, but usually it's more often than not. And then if you're
[1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:04.720]  on suicide watch, it's 15 minutes. The clothing that you wear is made difficult for you to
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:10.120]  try to utilize it for any self harm purposes. So when you add on top of that, for anybody
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:16.280]  who has shown any degree of suicidal ideation and Rod Rosenstein effectively admitted yesterday
[1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:23.680]  or two days ago, tweet that all federal prosecutors and wardens know that someone that is charged
[1:11:23.680 --> 1:11:29.160]  with what Epstein is charged with is inherently and necessarily a suicide risk. That means
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:33.960]  they have to be put on suicide watch before they can be removed from suicide watch, which
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:37.600]  in suicide watch involves making sure that their clothes are in such a way that there's
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:42.360]  no chance of any kind of self harm, monitoring them on pretty much 24 seven all the time
[1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:48.360]  with both cameras and a human person constantly looking at them all the way through at least
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:53.320]  every 15 minutes, but usually more frequently, more often. And it involves a therapeutic
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:58.320]  care by a psychologist, a trained psychologist. And on top of that, before a person can be
[1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:04.560]  removed from suicide watch, they have to have the warden has to sign off, the chief shrink
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:09.800]  has to sign off and key supervisors and guards have to sign off here. What is already being
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.160]  admitted today and published in various reports today is that his first of all, someone was
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:20.000]  removed from his cell so that he was completely alone. That's a high risk for a suicidal person
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:27.280]  to be alone. Just hours before he is found dead. So that's for the one question will
[1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:33.640]  be, do we have videotape of him alive after that person was removed from itself? Because
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:37.520]  the question would be whether or not maybe he was already dead. And they just simply
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:42.920]  didn't realize he was dead and he'd been killed by his inmate, fellow inmate, we don't know.
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:45.680]  But that would be information we would want to know right away. And having dealt with
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:49.680]  these cases in other contexts would be evidence I would want to look at. I would want to look
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:55.760]  at the camera video footage for whatever it shows, who went in and out, who walked by,
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:01.320]  who looked at it, who examined it, when was the last time you was seen alive. So the probabilities
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:05.440]  of these aggregate set of error. So I was debating various people like Scott Adams and
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:09.360]  other people yesterday on social media, who were pointing out, you know, why attribute
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:15.160]  to intentionality, what incompetence could explain. The reason here is because incompetence
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.960]  almost never produces this outcome in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. You're going to
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.880]  see a lot of data and information from the press and the lab that will be talking about
[1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:27.280]  the high rate of suicides in jails. They're going to be talking about state jails, city
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:32.960]  jail, county jail. I know this because I bring those cases on a routine and regular basis.
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:37.920]  I probably brought more inmate suicide, death, self-harm related cases than all but a very
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:42.160]  few set of lawyers in the entire nation. And if you look at those cases, what those cases
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:47.040]  are going to reveal is that the Federal system does not have this problem. And it does not
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:52.000]  have this problem because they use so, so many procedures and protocols. You have to
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:57.920]  have a collective systemic aggregate error by a wide range, cross number of people at
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:03.080]  the same time and the same place as to the same person. What's the probabilities that
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:07.880]  the shrink messed up and the warden messed up and the supervisors messed up and the guards
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:15.200]  messed up and the cameras messed up all accidentally with the just from a sort of, the sort of
[1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:20.640]  Occam's razor. If you just use that standard or methodology, what is the most likely explanation?
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:25.160]  If we decontextualize it, we put this in Russia or we put this in other countries or we put
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:29.920]  this in a different time or we remove the name of Epstein or Clinton, our natural conclusion
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:35.080]  would be to say that foul play clearly occurred here. And it came out, this happened on the
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:41.160]  same day that he gets all those records disclosed by the case brought by Mike Cernovich and
[1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:46.000]  attorney Randaza in New York, which was a motion to intervene, which was to unseal a
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:51.680]  bunch of records. And what was interesting about that was the lawyer for the victim,
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:57.080]  who had brought the suit against the, to say Maxwell. And so the suit didn't involve Epstein
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:01.880]  directly and just involved him indirectly by all the evidence that the victim had concerning
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:07.040]  Mr. Epstein. So Epstein, you could say was the real party in interest, even if he was
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:12.720]  not the legal party at interest. And the, what the record showed is a lot of extraordinary
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:17.160]  information. It exonerated Trump. What the victim said was that she'd never seen Trump
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:20.800]  there. She'd never seen him even flirt with other women, at least of all be involved with
[1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:27.760]  anyone. By contrast, the information incriminated and implicated, uh, uh, Al Gore, Bill Clinton,
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:32.000]  Senator George Mitchell, which was a complete shock to me because that was the first time
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.720]  his name had come up. Prince Andrew, some of the most powerful, privileged people in
[1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:39.760]  the world, hedge fund, wall streeters, uh, other people. So when we come back on the
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:44.760]  other side, we'll talk about what's really happening in that case. What did that disclosure
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:48.760]  do mean? What does it mean for whether there's going to be a meaningful investigation into
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:53.120]  Epstein, whether there's going to be follow up criminal cases? What does the mysterious
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:58.120]  suicide, the Harvey Oswald style of Epstein mean going forward?
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:16:03.920]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you

[1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:01.120]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:04.240]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies. And the way they did so is because
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:08.680]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[1:19:08.680 --> 1:19:12.600]  over two decades. And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:15.920]  members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the
[1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:19.840]  public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic
[1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:23.640]  consequence to their course of conduct. Otherwise, they will never change. And they will become
[1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:27.400]  the Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran
[1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:31.240]  American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:35.960]  to recover after the Great Depression. The inforce audience is the fuel that flames the
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.520]  light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech,
[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:44.960]  to make real the original promise of an independent free press. Real collusion is Big Tech and
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:49.080]  big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to
[1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:52.560]  try to shake people's thoughts. And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:56.920]  not happening. It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:01.560]  Even it is what you just saw.
[1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:30.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:40.200]  Through the third and fourth dimension, it's the Alex Jones show. I'll ensure you're filling
[1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:44.000]  in for Alex Jones. Robert Barnes on the line with me. We're going to get right back into
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:48.640]  some of this Epstein news with Bob and some of these other headlines and developments
[1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:59.680]  we have. But first, ladies and gentlemen, you know, we are the space odyssey. We are
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:09.480]  the Millennium Falcon. And they want to shut down because we covered the Epstein stuff
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:16.280]  years ago. It's almost like so old hat to us, the Epstein stuff. It's just a review
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:21.440]  almost. But there's other stories that we cover that they don't cover anywhere else
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:29.640]  either. And that's why they want us banned. But thanks to the audience going to infoorstore.com
[1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:36.160]  buying the toothpaste, buying the toothbrushes, buying the shampoo, buying the body wash, buying

[1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:56.160]  now you see why info wars is the most banned news network out there, folks. And you know,
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:22:02.440]  here's what I here's here's the challenge. How do you get people to understand how real
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:08.440]  this all is? How do you get people to really sink their teeth and their mind and their
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:13.760]  soul and their spirit and their consciousness into this to realize how real it is? Because,
[1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:19.240]  you know, you have all these Christians that read the Bible and live good lives, but they're
[1:22:19.240 --> 1:22:24.800]  missing the fight. They're missing the battle. They don't even realize that this is the fight
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:29.520]  of good and evil. This is the spiritual battle that we're in right now. And so we just come
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:35.400]  here every day, put it all on the line in this spiritual battle. And it's thanks to

[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:20.360]  Okay, we're going to get back on with Bob Barnes here shortly. And then Patrick Halley
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:27.240]  is going to be joining us to again, sink our teeth into all of this Epstein news. But I've
[1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:32.880]  got so much to get to. Let me just do this though. I'm going to go down this headline
[1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:38.400]  of Epstein, these headlines of Epstein news. And let's see if we can't read the tea leaves
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:46.680]  of what's coming next. So Attorney General Bob Barr says he has serious questions about
[1:23:46.680 --> 1:23:53.600]  the Epstein death. Well, okay, serious questions. Because I try to figure out what does that
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:59.240]  really mean? Well, if he's got serious questions, you think he'd be asking him, but he's not.
[1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:04.320]  So does he really have serious questions? This is an insult to Barnes. It's just, or
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:08.920]  excuse me, to Barr. Just maybe he already knows what happened. Maybe he was part of
[1:24:08.920 --> 1:24:13.400]  it. Again, that doesn't mean bad or good. Like FC might be out. Folks, they could have easily
[1:24:13.400 --> 1:24:17.520]  just gotten him out of jail, put him in witness protection. You see the conspiracy theories.
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:20.600]  Oh, that's not Epstein. Well, maybe it's not. I don't know. I know he didn't get
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:26.280]  suicide. Or I know he didn't commit suicide. So, so does Attorney General Bob Barr. He's
[1:24:26.280 --> 1:24:31.000]  got serious questions, he says. We'll see. They didn't check on him for hours. Apparently
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:36.840]  they ended the suicide watch. Even the Daily Beast, and it's all to try to connect it to
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:42.520]  Trump, but even the Daily Beast has the biggest bombshells from the Jeffrey Epstein documents
[1:24:42.520 --> 1:24:49.520]  directed to have sex, his sex slaves with the world's most powerful men. Epstein needed
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:56.960]  three orgasms a day, used over a hundred girls and sex toys. It's just, it's all in
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:25:04.560]  here. Swedish girl says she was held hostage at the age of 15. Yeah. And then they always
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:07.800]  try to tie it back into Trump. That's the whole point of the Daily Beast even doing
[1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:14.680]  this is try to tie it back into Trump. But it's all about sex slaves and what Epstein
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:20.960]  was doing on his island. The computers and hard drives were removed before the police
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:28.040]  raid. So, but again, they try to connect to Trump. And so now people saying, Oh, they're
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:31.480]  actually questioning the death because they think it has something to do with Trump. Seven
[1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:34.880]  unanswered questions about Epstein's death that the mainstream media is not talking about
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:40.280]  from Michael Snyder. Why are the autopsy results being delayed? What will any cameras show
[1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:45.480]  if we'll ever see it? We won't. Why was Epstein off suicide watch? Why did guards break the
[1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:54.120]  rules? Why would Epstein try to kill himself? Why would Epstein tell the guards someone was
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.800]  trying to kill him? Yeah, folks, the defense came out. They, they said Epstein was going
[1:25:57.800 --> 1:26:00.720]  to die. You can go back and read the stories. They said someone's trying to kill Epstein.
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:06.920]  They all knew how would Epstein kill himself? Mainstream media won't answer wealth of Jeffrey
[1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:13.640]  Epstein's brother. Also a mystery. That story in Wall Street Journal. Uh, yeah, is it really
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:21.640]  so much of a mystery? What happens to Jeffrey Epstein's money and homes now can feds sees
[1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:26.080]  everything? So, uh, let's get Bob Barnes back on. So we know the names, a lot of the
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:30.560]  names, probably not all of the names. We know a lot of the circumstances. People are finally
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:34.600]  realizing that this guy was part of a huge criminal network. I guess his brother was
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:40.600]  even making money off of it. Uh, so what do you think comes next as this in the legal
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:46.920]  terms, everything, the focus switches over to Maxwell and I'm hearing that she's going
[1:26:46.920 --> 1:26:51.080]  to cooperate. And I think that's cause she's afraid that she might commit suicide soon.
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:55.800]  Uh, but where do you think all of this goes next, Bob Barnes? We know Maxwell has a very
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:27:02.920]  unusual history. So her father was Robert Maxwell, who mysteriously died in under, uh,
[1:27:02.920 --> 1:27:07.600]  unusual circumstances himself. Many years ago, there was allegations of intelligence
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:13.240]  agency ties, bank fraud allegations, financial fraud allegations, goes out onto his yacht.
[1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:17.280]  Everything seemed to be cool and kosher. And then they just find him dead. Uh, they claimed
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.560]  it was suicide by drowning. That's the very unusual way to commit suicide. So if you're
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:27.160]  her, your father died under unusual circumstances. Uh, now, uh, the person you were the most
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:31.680]  connected to Mr. Epstein dies under unusual circumstances, while in federal custody, the
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:36.160]  safest place you're supposed to be. Uh, there's rumors and talk that nobody actually knows
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:41.320]  exactly where she is right now. So the, I mean, whether she's even around, whether she's
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:47.200]  disappeared, whether she can be found. So I think that the attorney general bar is serious.
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:52.040]  And today he said he acknowledged there were serious irregularities with what took place,
[1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:56.680]  serious problems with what took place at NCC. He also said that all the co-conspirators
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:01.200]  should not be, uh, thinking that this ends the case, that they are going to try to pursue
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:06.400]  it. I think it's a practical matter when the justice department in the feds and the Southern
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:11.680]  District of New York chose not to raid his properties in, uh, New Mexico, in the Virgin
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:16.360]  Islands, uh, in the, uh, in Florida, that meant they were not going to be able to gather
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.040]  the kind of evidence that they should. And it provided an opportunity for other people
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:25.560]  as info wars as reported, uh, there's unusual activity, uh, at the Virgin Islands home of
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:30.400]  Jeffrey Epstein or that's unexplained activity, uh, taking place there. So yeah, they took
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:34.280]  down the dome. There was a bunch of construction, underground construction. It looks like even
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:40.640]  um, they were exhuming things. I don't want to get too conspiratorial. Um, but if you
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:44.120]  can stay another segment, uh, maybe we'll have you on with a segment with Patrick Halley.
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:47.840]  We had a bad Skype connection. We had to get reconnected, but I kind of want to, again,
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:52.880]  uh, cause I don't, uh, Attorney General Barr says, Oh, he's got serious questions.
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:56.920]  Well, look, I mean, I want to get into that cause he knows what's going on or he wants
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:03.000]  to, he can ask fellow patriots. My name is Todd Savage, founder of black rifle, realestate.com.

[1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:36.960]  We've got Robert Barnes and we've got Patrick Halley on the air with us right now. We're
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:41.560]  discussing Jeffrey Epstein. Let me put this question out there to both of you and get
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:46.760]  both of your takes on this. Attorney General Bob Barr says he has serious questions about
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:53.280]  Epstein's death. Well, it's been, I don't know the exact hours, let's say at least 50
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:57.400]  since Epstein's death. Any questions that Barr had, he could have already had answered
[1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:05.240]  by now and he knows or he already knew the answers before he claimed to have the questions.
[1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:09.640]  Let's go first to Robert Barnes and then Patrick Halley on this. What do you take away from
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:15.040]  Attorney General Barr saying he has serious questions? So is he really insinuating that
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:20.800]  this went on right under his nose and something happened or and he's really has questions
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:25.400]  and then did he ask them? Why isn't he made a public or does he already know the answers
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:30.240]  and he's just going along for the ride? I suspect he does not know the full answers
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:34.400]  and the reason for that is there's a range of administrative procedures and protocols
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:40.680]  involved, including the BOP corrections officers are represented by unions. And so you're going
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:45.040]  to have a natural COIA effort taking place here. So the probabilities they're giving
[1:34:45.040 --> 1:34:49.040]  clear communication to him is low. They're probably saying we're investigating, we're
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:52.920]  trying to figure out there are some things that we found that did that happen that weren't
[1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:57.120]  supposed to happen, but we don't know the whole story yet and we're reviewing it. And
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:01.240]  because of the evidentiary methodologies that have to be required under the Union Contract
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:05.680]  and Internal Federal Administrative Procedures Act, that creates a situation whereby they
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:11.880]  can stall him. They can't stall him in Terminal. It can stall him for at least several days.
[1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:15.480]  So I think what he's saying is he's recognizing something happened here that wasn't supposed
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:20.280]  to give him credit. When's the last time you saw something like this happen? And immediately
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:23.360]  the Attorney General of the United States come out and say something seriously wrong.
[1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:28.280]  Right. And of course the president retweets Terrence Williams videos talking about how
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:33.440]  it's so, you know, obviously sketchy, say the least. But I'll rephrase the question
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:37.280]  and go to Patrick Halley. I guess my point here is that there's really, to me, only
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:46.480]  three legitimate possible scenarios here. One, they, and Barr being involved, snuck
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:51.520]  him out of prison so that they could put him under witness protection and he could continue
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:56.680]  to give whatever cooperation he was giving. Or two, he was killed. Someone got in and
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:02.160]  killed him. Or three, somehow he was actually snuck out of jail. Somehow they actually broke
[1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.520]  him out of jail. So the final two scenarios Barr would obviously have questions. The first
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:09.520]  one I think he would be involved in. Patrick Halley, what do you think's going on?
[1:36:09.520 --> 1:36:14.120]  Well, oh, and my general belief is that Epstein is dead and they did kill him and that the
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:18.940]  Clintons were involved. Now, regardless of which scenario actually happened, the responsibility
[1:36:18.940 --> 1:36:23.880]  is on Attorney General Barr to keep this thing going. You can tell very easily what the play
[1:36:23.880 --> 1:36:31.360]  is for the deep state by reading NBC News. Immediately after Epstein's death, NBC News
[1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:36.200]  laid out this high up very clearly and said there will probably not be any more criminal
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:40.280]  investigation stemming from this. No case against Gisela and Maxwell, but there will
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:46.000]  be civil suits. Now, the civil suits are being managed by Lisa Bloom. Lisa Bloom, who is
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:50.920]  Gloria Allred's daughter, is actually handling the civil cases. And the reason they're allowed
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:56.000]  to sue is because Andrew Cuomo in February signed a law that gives them an extra year
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.600]  in order to file this case, even though the statute of limitations ran out. So the Democrat
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:05.480]  establishment is managing this and they want these lawsuits to happen because it gives
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:08.000]  Gloria Allred's daughter the opportunity to limit this.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.600]  I'm actually glad you went there. I'm sorry to cut you off, but I actually want to focus
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:18.640]  on this because I saw this and now I'm starting to wonder because Gloria Allred, Lisa Bloom,
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:22.160]  while they definitely smell blood in the water and they're legal sharks, maybe they actually
[1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:29.200]  want to bring this fish in or are they maybe not, maybe they're not being fully honest
[1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:32.960]  with these victims and they're trying to keep the situation under control. I mean, I don't
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:36.320]  want to think the worst of Aldrin and Bloom, but I mean, we got to look at all the angles
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:37.320]  here.
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:42.240]  Oh, of course. Look, the government has seized a tremendous amount of Jeffrey Epstein's property,
[1:37:42.240 --> 1:37:46.000]  including stuff that was on that island where we know there was a satanic temple and a statue
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:52.280]  of Malik the Owl next to the satanic temple. Now, that evidence needs to come out and Attorney
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:56.280]  General Barr needs to bring it out. However, there are agents who are trying to suppress
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:00.560]  that. James Comey's daughter, Marine Comey was added by SDNY as a prosecutor on this
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:05.280]  case to try to limit the investigation. So all of this Clinton stuff wouldn't come out.
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:10.880]  But I encourage you to look at the Gisela and Maxwell civil case deposition from a few
[1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:15.080]  years ago, which was unsealed one day before Epstein's death, in which Virginia Roberts
[1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:20.800]  made it very clear that there was a party on Epstein's island thrown for Bill Clinton
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:25.520]  after he left office. I believe that took place in 2002 and there were underage girls
[1:38:25.520 --> 1:38:26.520]  present.
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:29.080]  Well, and let's be clear. The whole thing with the Clinton body count is just that the
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:34.080]  Clintons have had all these people die mysteriously around them. It's well known. The crimes of
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:38.920]  Bill Clinton in Arkansas by the locals, you know, the mainstream news covers it up. But
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:43.760]  really, there's elites all over the world that want Epstein dead. I mean, we're talking
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:47.840]  about British Royalty too. So the whole Clinton connection is just, oh, the Clinton body counts
[1:38:47.840 --> 1:38:51.040]  already a trend and oh, they're connected to the Clintons. But a lot of people had interest
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:55.800]  in Epstein being dead. But Bob Barnes, let me ask you, what do you make of Gloria Alred
[1:38:55.800 --> 1:39:02.640]  and Lisa Bloom being in charge of these civil suits right now? Do you think they have the
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:06.520]  victim's best interest in mind or as usual, perhaps their own best interest in mind or
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:09.480]  perhaps maybe a democratic party's interest in mind?
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:15.200]  Well, I think a good background on this is that the main victim's lawyer that was involved
[1:39:15.200 --> 1:39:20.280]  in the Maxwell case that who was opposing and objecting to the intervention and the
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:25.080]  unsealing of the records from Mike Cernovich, that lawyer is David Bowie's law firm. So
[1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:30.640]  people can Google David Bowie's, B-O-I-E-S, and draw their own conclusions about whether
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:35.920]  Bowie's is a conflicted attorney involved in the proceedings because here that he kept
[1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:41.360]  arguing, his firm kept arguing in federal court that the record should remain sealed
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:46.400]  because somehow they would damage the victim. But once the records were unsealed, almost
[1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:50.960]  none of the records damaged the victim. And instead, the records damaged people like Al
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:55.520]  Gore, people like Senator George Mitchell, people like, who was the Senate Majority Leader
[1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:59.040]  for a long time, the people like Prince Andrew.
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:02.840]  Well, that's what I'm saying here. That's why I want your legal expertise on this because
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:07.040]  again, I don't want to think the worst of these lawyer groups, and I don't want to,
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:13.280]  you know, become some sort of snare in the victim's mentality here. But I mean, you
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:17.240]  got to wonder, I mean, Lisa Bloom, Gloria Alred, any other situation, they're on national
[1:40:17.240 --> 1:40:21.080]  TV doing interviews 24 seven. I haven't seen one TV once, Bob.
[1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:26.280]  Not only that, I think also here's the other consequence of Epstein's death. It's not clear
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:31.400]  to me how any of those suits go forward now because the way a person is dead, the legal
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:35.360]  system generally does not allow a suit against them to go forward because they're not in
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:39.080]  a position to defend themselves. So I guess technically they're going to be suing the
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:44.560]  estate of Jeff Epstein for a personal harm claim. And I'm just not sure how that's going
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:49.680]  to work. So I think what is happening is there has been, we call it captured counsel in the
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.480]  business. So it's where a lawyer's interest is really conflicted in their goal and objective.
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:59.840]  You see often in mob cases, you see it in drug conspiracy cases, where really the lawyers
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:05.440]  involved are representing the interest of someone else other than their nominal client.
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:10.480]  And that's the concern here about David Bowie's firm is he didn't, wasn't he conflicted? David
[1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:16.440]  Bowie's famously represented Al Gore and Bush v. Gore 2000. When it came out that in fact
[1:41:16.440 --> 1:41:23.080]  his client had identified Al Gore's potentially a problematic individual connected Epstein,
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:26.080]  doesn't that create a conflict of interest that precludes him from being involved?
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:30.240]  You know, at first hand, I mean, we won't get too into details, but I mean, folks, you'll
[1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:36.400]  be high profile lawyers to try to get in control of a case will offer services, you know, just
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:40.680]  to control a case. I mean, we don't need to get into too much detail, but I mean, we've
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:45.880]  seen it. So again, I'm not saying that's what's happening. We just have to ask these questions.
[1:41:45.880 --> 1:41:50.480]  Oh, no doubt about it. There's no doubt that the David I've dealt with, I've prepared David
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:55.160]  Bowie's to Robert Mueller. He is to the deep state outside the system inside the legal
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:58.920]  system, what Robert Mueller was inside the government. And I've dealt with him in multiple
[1:41:58.920 --> 1:42:03.760]  contexts and multiple cases where his fingerprints were left on the case where he conveniently
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:09.640]  provided a scapegoat for institutional interest, often against the nominal interest of his
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:13.680]  client. So the fact that it's just weird, David Bowie's is not a personal injury lawyer.
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:17.320]  He's not a human trafficking lawyer. He's not a sexual harassment lawyer. How did he
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:23.000]  get control over key cases that implicated potential high profile Democrats? Do you the
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.880]  idea of who David Bowie says? David Bowie's was Harvey Weinstein's lawyer for a long
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:30.400]  period of time. But isn't the answer though, to your question, isn't the answer now to
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:36.400]  file civil suits against Maxwell and go that angle? I mean, actually info wars is going
[1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:41.400]  to be looking at moving to intervene in some of these cases and bringing FOIA actions so
[1:42:41.400 --> 1:42:45.760]  that we get independent sourced information so that they can't continue to hide and cover
[1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:51.920]  up this stuff. All right, Bob Barnes, great work as always, folks. Robert Barnes, LLP.com
[1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:56.040]  and he's just got the legal expertise in the inside knowledge. When I come back, Patrick

[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:45.520]  time you keep this symbol of free speech and pro human values alive, the enemy comes one
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:50.400]  step closer to their system falling. We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their

[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:03.760]  Last night I'm on infowars.com and I read Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[1:44:03.760 --> 1:44:09.120]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned. A Betsy Ross but also another just classic
[1:44:09.120 --> 1:44:14.760]  American flag all 50 stars with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it. And on the back,
[1:44:14.760 --> 1:44:18.800]  America's back infowars.com. But what's better than just an American flag about a don't
[1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:22.360]  tread on me under the flag? Don't tread on the American flag. It's a perfect combo. So
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:25.480]  great minds think alike. I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the
[1:44:25.480 --> 1:44:31.000]  exact same similar design. It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:36.040]  by the triggering of leftist of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt. But it's a battle tattered
[1:44:36.040 --> 1:44:40.160]  flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter. And again, on the back, it says America's
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:46.920]  back infowars.com. 4,000 of these babies. And that's it. So we've got the Betsy Ross
[1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:52.360]  version and the American flag version at infowars.com. Be imprinted in the USA right
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:58.880]  now infowars.com. They'll be right back. The most banned broadcast in the world.
[1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:04.360]  Before I started working at infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com,
[1:45:04.360 --> 1:45:09.800]  but also the products at infowars.com. And there's one product that's offered at infowars.com
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:14.800]  that is the elite of the supplements. And that's DNA Force Plus. Now, I remember when
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:19.280]  Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests, telomeres and
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:24.320]  telomere support with your DNA. And so I started to look into the science and what telomeres
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:30.440]  were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:35.360]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive. Why? Because it is an
[1:45:35.360 --> 1:45:40.360]  elite supplement. And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:45.840]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is
[1:45:45.840 --> 1:45:51.040]  still there. It is the elite supplement. I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:57.040]  because I know it's expensive. So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:45:58.040]  infowarsstore.com.
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:03.920]  Alex. Yes. I got a plug for the Patriot points I get. Oh, thanks. I got $180 so far this
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:08.040]  year and I feel like I'm stealing from you. I buy so much in the store because I mean,
[1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:10.400]  I don't want to give that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people
[1:46:10.400 --> 1:46:13.560]  who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in. So I'd rather give that money
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:17.120]  to you and then getting quality products. The products that I do receive have changed
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:21.400]  my life. I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:25.320]  a whole lot better. I think my kids, they use the toothpaste. My son used to get these
[1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:29.200]  little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore
[1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:30.200]  throat.
[1:46:30.200 --> 1:46:33.560]  Well, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want a good
[1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:38.280]  price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.880]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the fish
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:45.840]  oil or the turmeric or the bone broth. Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:50.160]  people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're
[1:46:50.160 --> 1:46:54.160]  already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off and then
[1:46:54.160 --> 1:46:57.840]  you do something like that. We have Patriot points. We lose money, but that's okay. Thanks
[1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:01.960]  for the support.
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:03.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:31.760]  What a time to be alive. Oh man. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Still on air. Despite
[1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:38.480]  the fake news saying we're dead. No, we're alive. You're dead. We're still here. We have
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:45.680]  an audience. We independently fund ourselves with the millions and millions of audience
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:51.360]  members, the great supplements at infowarestore.com. We get the best guests off like Patrick
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:57.920]  Howley, who's been covering this Epstein story for a long time. So Patrick, let's do this.
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:06.720]  Let's really put into perspective here who Jeffrey Epstein was and why there was so much
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:14.360]  interest amongst very high profile, public, famous, influential elite people to shut him
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.000]  up and have him dead if the case is he's actually dead, whether he's dead or not. I guess we
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:23.680]  could debate, but they wanted him dead. There's no doubt about that. All the victims knew it.
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:29.920]  The lawyers victims knew it. He knew it. Everybody knew it. And now somehow he's dead. So why
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.360]  though? What's the big Epstein story? To audience people that may not know, you've been following
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:38.280]  this for a long time. Who is Jeffrey Epstein? How did he end up here? And why do all these
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:43.680]  elite people want him dead? Well, we're still finding out who Jeffrey Epstein was because
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.000]  it's still very unclear how he made his money. He's presented as a financier and a hedge fund
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:52.880]  manager. But if you look at his finances, the money was very mysteriously put into his
[1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:57.560]  accounts. If you look at Mark Epstein, his brother, who's a real estate person, it also
[1:48:57.560 --> 1:49:02.880]  a lot of mysterious wealth. We know from the former labor secretary, Alex Acosta, when
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:07.240]  he was interviewing with the Trump transition team, he was asked about the fact that he
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:12.320]  gave Epstein a sweetheart deal the last time around when he was convicted of pedophilia.
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:16.920]  Alex Acosta identified Epstein as a member of intelligence and he was told from high
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.160]  up Robert Mueller, of course, being the FBI director at the time to lay off of the case.
[1:49:22.160 --> 1:49:27.640]  Epstein was a socialite in Palm Beach in that area. And he was taking wealthy people, including
[1:49:27.640 --> 1:49:33.520]  Hollywood celebrities like Kevin Spacey, who recently had his charges dropped against him,
[1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:38.600]  possibly in return for cooperation, like Bill Clinton at least 27 times. He was flying them
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:43.440]  on his private jet and taking them down to his island, pedophile island, a little St.
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:49.360]  John Island, where there was a temple that was stocked with a lot of surveillance cameras,
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:56.520]  footage of a lot of elites engaging in pedophilic activity. This, I believe, was used as blackmail
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:59.280]  against high level politicians as a scythe.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:03.120]  No, exactly. And let's just be clear so that people can understand better. This is like
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:09.800]  a local police officer, or let's say you're a police officer and you go bust a drug dealer
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:15.480]  and he's got a small time deal, but he's got some cocaine, whatever, selling drugs.
[1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:18.760]  And you take it to your upper, your boss, wherever you're saying, hey, I got this guy
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:23.600]  doing this and he says, okay, look, I need you to let him go. He's an informant for us.
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:26.320]  And so I just need you to sit this case down. Well, you're kind of frustrated. What does
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:31.040]  that mean? Well, that means the cops are using him to pinpoint other drug dealers. I mean,
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:35.320]  that's basically what's going on. So essentially that's what the, but it's not even that. It's
[1:50:35.320 --> 1:50:40.480]  that the FBI was using Epstein to blackmail people, to put them in positions of power
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:45.480]  and influence to then control culture, control society, control politics, control the flow
[1:50:45.480 --> 1:50:50.560]  of information. And that's what he was being used for as an informant, not like, oh, I'm
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:54.200]  going to help you get the bad guys. He never helped any bad guys. He never helped. No,
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:58.920]  he never brought anybody in. So the whole thing was a blackmail thing. The FBI was using
[1:50:58.920 --> 1:51:05.400]  the dark shadow government to keep their power structure alive and well in the West.
[1:51:05.400 --> 1:51:09.800]  Absolutely. He had Clinton and Gore in his pocket and he was obsessed with getting close
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:13.640]  to Donald Trump, which is why he was constantly hanging around Mar-a-Lago, which is why he
[1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:17.640]  was banned from Mar-a-Lago. Now, the fact that this bombshell witness Virginia Roberts
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:22.640]  was as a teenager employed at Mar-a-Lago only, only continues to confirm what I've known
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:27.560]  for years, which is that Donald Trump has been on a mission for about a decade to try
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:31.720]  to bring Jeffrey Epstein to justice and use it as a placeholder case to bring down the
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:35.200]  other big fish in human trafficking. Well, I'll hold right there because this is huge
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:38.200]  where you're saying, I really want you to get into this. You've been following this
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:42.080]  for a decade. You believe that what Donald Trump knew, let's remember, he put out a tweet
[1:51:42.080 --> 1:51:47.040]  saying pedophiles need to hang. I'm paraphrasing, but you think Trump has been following this,
[1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:50.480]  known about this, been trying to stop what Epstein is doing. Obviously, you knew the
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:55.240]  Clintons were involved. You think he's been doing this for 10 years and you say you have
[1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:58.840]  the, your research is what's led you to that belief.
[1:51:58.840 --> 1:52:04.400]  Oh, absolutely. Trump assisted the last prosecution effort against Epstein when he was busted
[1:52:04.400 --> 1:52:08.640]  for pedophilia. Unfortunately, under Robert Mueller, Epstein got a sweetheart deal and
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:13.240]  got out and continued partying with socialites like Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:18.240]  and the Clintons and big time actors. Now, in this most recent version with Trump as
[1:52:18.240 --> 1:52:22.320]  the president, you know, this was supposed to be a placeholder case to bring down all
[1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.280]  of these people who are involved in human trafficking. There are now so many links to
[1:52:26.280 --> 1:52:27.280]  human trafficking.
[1:52:27.280 --> 1:52:30.680]  I was gonna say, I mean, I'm sure you've been seeing like Operation Broken Heart, the thousands
[1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:33.160]  of pedophiles being arrested nationwide.
[1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:39.360]  Oh, yes, absolutely. This is a big Trump administration initiative. The Nexium sex cult case was also
[1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:44.040]  a placeholder case. Of course, we know Mexican children were gaming the immigration system
[1:52:44.040 --> 1:52:48.840]  and coming into this country. And that case is also very relevant because we know that
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:53.920]  the rainbow cultural gardens, which were overseen by Hillary Clinton's donor, Claire Bronfman,
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:58.960]  were actually experimenting on children and they were based in Mexico and Guatemala in
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:03.360]  addition to the United States. So you can trace the entire map of human trafficking
[1:53:03.360 --> 1:53:08.800]  into this country, including land in the Southwestern United States that is owned by the company
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:14.240]  Semex. Semex, the majority stakeholder in it is Bronfman Rothschild, a firm that is run
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:18.840]  by Claire Bronfman's brother, Matthew Bronfman. So they even own the land that the child slaves
[1:53:18.840 --> 1:53:24.280]  come up over the entire human trafficking network is being exposed and pulled apart.
[1:53:24.280 --> 1:53:29.520]  And it's all linked to satanic elites who practice the Luciferian religion. And based
[1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:34.000]  on the teachings of Aleister Crowley, and this is all true, it's not a conspiracy theory,
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:40.440]  they do sacrifice children on a pentagram. And we don't have to get too into this, but
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:44.400]  like, I mean, the audience can go down and do this. If you really want a red pill, if
[1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:49.720]  you want a rabbit, I mean, they get these ancient texts and they actually believe they're doing
[1:53:49.720 --> 1:53:54.240]  these rituals. They ingest drugs, they do all kinds of hallucinogens, they engage in
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:54:00.080]  sex stuff that can be tied with these, if they're doing stuff that the average person
[1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:05.600]  can't even conceive, but it's ancient stuff that they've just been involved with forever.
[1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:10.360]  And so where do you think it goes from here? It's all being exposed, but is enough going
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:14.520]  to come out to the average individual where they really have an awakening of the soul
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:19.840]  of the spirit, the flesh, the mind that it's like, wow, we're really in this, there really
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:22.880]  are forces of evil. I mean, I look at the average Christian that reads the Bible that
[1:54:22.880 --> 1:54:27.600]  has no idea this is going on. It's like, hey, I mean, it's time for people to get active
[1:54:27.600 --> 1:54:29.360]  in the spiritual war here.
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:34.320]  Well, it really is up to the Trump administration. The reason why we had so much success with
[1:54:34.320 --> 1:54:39.120]  the Nexium case is because there was a sensationalistic celebrity trial at Brooklyn Federal Court
[1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:42.700]  that was being waged by the Department of Justice and I got a conviction. And I think
[1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:47.920]  Claire Bronfman is going to face additional charges for visa fraud. But you know, the
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:52.600]  force of the mainstream media is still pretty potent in terms of brainwashing the average
[1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:55.880]  Ellen DeGeneres viewer into thinking that these things are not happening.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:58.920]  Do you think this is a breaking point? Because, I mean, the average individual knows one
[1:54:58.920 --> 1:55:02.680]  plus one still equals two. And they're trying to say one plus one equals three with this
[1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:06.480]  abscene deal. I mean, I see a major awakening happening here.
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:10.880]  Oh, absolutely. I think it's happening all over the world. And, you know, I think Donald
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:14.720]  Trump is definitely at the center of it. I think these things are going to continue.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:18.560]  And I think we absolutely cannot drop the ball on this opportunity because the entire
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.320]  world is looking at the situation right now and realizing that there are very corrupt
[1:55:22.320 --> 1:55:27.000]  people close to the Clintons who are now dying under mysterious circumstances. This has been
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:30.400]  going on for a long time and it's right in front of our faces now. So we need to all
[1:55:30.400 --> 1:55:34.640]  seize this opportunity because, you know, this is something that could truly change
[1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:35.640]  the world.
[1:55:35.640 --> 1:55:40.360]  No, that's exactly it. And we've got a social media team here. We do like promotional videos
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:44.000]  during the break stuff for our subscribes, our accounts and everything. And they came
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.760]  in here and they're like, Hey, just give us like 30 seconds to a minute. And that's exactly
[1:55:47.760 --> 1:55:53.880]  what I said. It's like I see a window of opportunity here where people that aren't necessarily
[1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:56.720]  politically involved. It's like the whole thing like ratings for sporting events and
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:01.000]  attendance is going down because it's not delivering anything. There's nothing. It's
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.800]  a, it's a superficial surface value, which is sad because that's where society is. I
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:09.400]  mean, really society is just so shallow now. Everything's on the surface. Everything's
[1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:12.360]  superficial. So they can't even, it's almost that they don't even have the ability to
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:17.400]  go so deep. But I think this is a huge moment because the average American citizen can see
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:23.320]  this story, look into Epstein, see the cover up and just be like, okay, wait a second.
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:28.000]  Clearly this guy was murdered. Clearly the mainstream, because that's what was my awakening
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.840]  process is I just saw an event happen that I never questioned things. I never thought
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:36.920]  TV media would lie. And I just saw an event happening and then looked into it for myself
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:40.960]  and then it was like, whoa, it was, I mean, everything clicks. When you see that there
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.960]  are people just, when you see there are people consciously lying to you, trying to deceive
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:49.960]  you on air. I mean, that's a, that's a life changing experience. It was for me. I think
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:54.080]  that's where we're at here, Patrick. Yeah, I don't think we're in a war between right
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:58.720]  or left. I think we're in a war between the 2d narrative and the 3d narrative. When Hillary
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:03.560]  Clinton finally sobered up and gave her concession speech after losing the election, both her
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:08.720]  and Bill Clinton wore purple, Bill Clinton wore a purple tie. She wore a purple dress.
[1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:12.480]  Now that's a call signal to her fellow deep state people that they're going to try to
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:16.840]  control both sides. And they have done that through the FBI, through Christopher Ray,
[1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:21.000]  James Comey. What they didn't count on was that Trump was going to clean out the Department
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:26.240]  of Justice and really go as hard as he could to try to clean out this entire system. So
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:31.160]  you know, this is going to take Donald Trump doing everything he can. It's also going to
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:36.240]  take us doing everything that we can. I don't believe that Jeffrey Epstein was truly a believer
[1:57:36.240 --> 1:57:40.880]  in this Luciferian religion. I believe that he was an asset who was simply blackmailing
[1:57:40.880 --> 1:57:44.720]  politicians. All right, let's get into the final five minutes here with Patrick Halley.
[1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:52.520]  Let's talk about that. Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our Republic
[1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:56.440]  was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close
[1:57:56.440 --> 1:58:00.920]  to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today,
[1:58:00.920 --> 1:58:07.040]  the Communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:12.120]  in polls to support for the president. And what he's doing in this trade war, once China
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:17.000]  put pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied. And we
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:21.840]  aren't going to back down. So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world
[1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:25.880]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:31.360]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at info wars.com and
[1:58:31.360 --> 1:58:36.920]  news wars.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:41.720]  the light, the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:10.000]  defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:40.840]  going to continue. We're going to keep fighting in the info war. And even if something does
[1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:45.560]  happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up
[1:59:45.560 --> 1:59:47.200]  for liberty. Thank you sir for calling.
[1:59:47.200 --> 2:00:12.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Oh,
[2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:17.120]  you're here with you. We've got one segment left with Patrick Halley at Halley reporter on
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:22.120]  Twitter. Now I did a little, I'm not much of an artist, but I did a little rendition of
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:27.880]  visual representation of what Patrick was talking about in the last segment, 2d news versus
[2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:34.120]  3d news. The 2d news says, Oh, here's the surface. Jeffrey Epstein is dead. He committed
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:41.360]  suicide. The 3d news says, Well, here's everything behind it. So here's what it is. 2d news gives
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:47.920]  you two shapes right here. And you see two shapes and you say A or B and the 2d news says B is
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:53.040]  the bigger shape. And you look at it and you say, Oh, okay, 2d news is right. Big is the
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:59.120]  better shape. Oh, but you see the 3d news tells you the truth. When you get away from the
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:07.320]  surface level view, you see that a, because of its depth is actually much bigger than
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:13.880]  B. But because the 2d news only shows you the surface angle, you never know that they're
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:18.280]  lying to you. And so we're just simply here showing you the background, putting all the
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:22.920]  pieces together, letting you know the real story while they're trying to say, Oh, no,
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:25.920]  nothing to see here. Jeffrey Epstein just committed suicide. So Patrick Halley, you've
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:30.480]  been following Epstein for decades. What do you think comes next? What is the most significant
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:33.480]  thing this audience needs to know about Epstein as we move forward?
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:40.240]  Well, look, there are at least 102 Jane Doe's. There are at least 102 known victims of this.
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:44.200]  They all don't have to be represented by Gloria Allred or Lisa Bloom. They can be represented
[2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:49.240]  by Robert or any other lawyer who wants to take these cases on. Civil litigation can
[2:01:49.240 --> 2:01:54.560]  only go so far. We really do need President Donald Trump to step in and command Attorney
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:58.720]  General Barr to get to the bottom of it. And I believe that he is going to do that. Jeffrey
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:03.560]  Epstein was a character. He was a work of fiction. This guy was not really part of the
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:09.800]  super top level of the elite. He was used by handlers as an asset to try to set people
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:14.040]  up. You know, my understanding of him was always that he was secular and he was not
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:18.360]  part of the Luciferian religion, but he was used to blackmail road scholars like Bill
[2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:21.960]  Clinton and people who had been through the system and who knew that they were supposed
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:26.920]  to engage in some kind of satanic activity. However, the satanic activity that was going
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:31.360]  on on that island was closely monitored and used for blackmail. I think that the fact
[2:02:31.360 --> 2:02:35.840]  that he was not really a member of their club made it easier to kill him. But we have to
[2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:42.640]  go at his handlers and we have to understand who the people were who were behind him because
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:47.320]  ultimately that's going to reveal the true power structure of our world. The media doesn't
[2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:51.040]  want to tell us the true power structure of the world or the fact that the right versus
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:55.320]  left paradigm is mostly false. And it was Alex Jones who when I was in high school really
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:03:00.800]  woke me up to the fact that the Iraq war was being used by Bush to play both sides and
[2:03:00.800 --> 2:03:05.400]  create a right versus left division that was not genuine in that case. It was truly the
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:07.960]  elites against the other people of the world.
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:13.920]  Well, and so all we really have here, which is it should be like the biggest news story.
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.960]  I mean, if you tune into news today, it's like barely even a breath of wind that they're
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:24.520]  breathing into this Epstein story, but it's huge. It's all coming out. Jeffrey Epstein
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:30.280]  being used as an FBI informant was involved with sex trafficking, human trafficking, who
[2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:35.320]  knows what else potentially human sacrifice. I mean, folks, just look at the other stories
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:39.600]  about quote unquote orgy islands like the stuff they had off of the islands of Italy
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:42.240]  where sometimes it ends in murder.
[2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:45.680]  So do you think though, do you mean, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think
[2:03:45.680 --> 2:03:48.480]  America is ever going to learn about this? Do you think this is ever going to come out
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:53.320]  or do you think it's going to be buried either by dark forces or buried by the good forces
[2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:57.680]  that brought this evil down, but don't think the American public can handle this?
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:01.840]  I'm determined to make sure that this stuff comes out as I have been for years. And look,
[2:04:01.840 --> 2:04:06.040]  there are a long list of placeholder cases. The Epstein has moved the ball down the field
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:09.880]  quite a bit as did next year. There's also a human trafficking civil case now against
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:14.160]  the church of Scientology, which is close to the Clintons, which is linked to the occult.
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:18.160]  There are other human trafficking cases. And if you look at Ed Buck, the Hillary Clinton
[2:04:18.160 --> 2:04:23.240]  donor now accused of human trafficking, Harvey Weinstein was accused of human trafficking.
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.200]  So there is a long list of targets. As long as Trump is the commander in chief, then we
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:31.960]  have a chance to use law enforcement to continue to prosecute these cases. And I'm going to
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:37.000]  do everything to expose child protective services and other things this week in my writings
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:43.560]  for the epic times in order to get that stuff out there. And I encourage you to follow all
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:47.320]  of my reporting because this week for me is really the go week on all this stuff.
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:52.480]  All right. At Howley Reporter on Twitter is where you can follow that work. We'll be right
[2:04:52.480 --> 2:04:59.600]  back with more of the Alex Jones show. The globalist are hyper competitive scientific
[2:04:59.600 --> 2:05:03.800]  dictators. They are technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words. And they
[2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:07.480]  believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions hits on the way
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:13.000]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. We're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:16.760]  fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. One of the biggest places that
[2:05:16.760 --> 2:05:21.920]  we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[2:05:21.920 --> 2:05:27.320]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:32.320]  we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottom
[2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:39.520]  and double the strength of it in a new formula. Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest
[2:05:39.520 --> 2:05:43.880]  highest quality B 12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere. It is amazing
[2:05:43.880 --> 2:05:49.120]  experience pure medical bottom and B 12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:56.120]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or triple A 253-3139.
[2:06:20.120 --> 2:06:25.400]  Paul Joseph Watson about to be joining us, but first we've got one day left ladies and
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:32.040]  gentlemen, one day left of the banniversary sale at infowarsstore.com, which includes

[2:06:57.480 --> 2:07:04.320]  don't have to cater to some big sponsorship corporate marketing programs agenda. We don't
[2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:11.320]  have one. We have you the audience and we have our independent shop infowarsstore.com,
[2:07:11.320 --> 2:07:18.320]  which funds everything we do here, which you've seen what Alex Jones has done with your support
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:24.720]  at infowarsstore.com. More reporters, more studios, more live shows, more breaking reports,
[2:07:24.720 --> 2:07:30.680]  more, more, more. And this is in the face of us getting less and less access. Now you
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:36.080]  are the missing link that allows infowars to get into the public spectrum. So we ask
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:41.600]  you to always share those links of info wars.com slash show. Tell people about the Alex Jones
[2:07:41.600 --> 2:07:46.400]  show and everything we're doing here at info wars because this is a major window of opportunity
[2:07:46.400 --> 2:07:52.120]  folks. Nobody's buying this Epstein thing. Nobody's buying it. It's going to be hot for
[2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:56.320]  maybe another day or two. As far as the average citizen, the public is concerned, then they're
[2:07:56.320 --> 2:08:00.480]  not going to care anymore. You need to say, Hey, look, you're not believe this Epstein
[2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:04.160]  thing because you're being lied to. Here's what's really going on. Check this out. Check
[2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:09.520]  out this broadcast at infowars.com slash show. This is how you awaken people folks. And this
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:14.560]  is a big window of opportunity. Do not let it close. Paul Joseph Watson. You've been
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:18.040]  covering this for a while. You did a video, I believe it was a week or two ago, pedophiles
[2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:23.480]  run the world boy. Uh, that seems to be even more important now that Epstein is dead than
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.960]  it was then when you put it out. But what do you make of Epstein's death? Or do you
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:34.080]  think he's still alive? What do you think is going on? Paul Joseph Watson? Well, that
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:39.240]  is one of the emerging conspiracy theories quote that's come out that they actually swapped
[2:08:39.240 --> 2:08:43.680]  him out with somebody else. So that, you know, he's been transferred back to Pido Island
[2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:48.160]  and everyone else gets off scot free. And that was the deal that he did with them as
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:52.720]  far as I've seen on that. It's just random posts on forum so far. What we do know. Oh,
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:58.480]  in today, this came out today. Top headline on info was Epstein cellmate was transferred
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:03.920]  out day before suicide. So it turns out that he did actually have a cellmate who would
[2:09:03.920 --> 2:09:10.160]  have witnessed what happened to Epstein, but just by coincidence, less than 24 hours before
[2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:15.760]  he's a parent suicide, this cellmate got transferred out. Of course, we know they didn't they claim
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:20.680]  they didn't have cameras within the jail cell itself, but they did have cameras trained on
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:25.800]  the outside on the doors. So they would have picked up whatever was happening if anyone
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:31.680]  was going in who was coming out rumors that those cameras mysteriously failed. So it's
[2:09:31.680 --> 2:09:38.000]  just faux pas on top of faux pas. Of course, the prison warden and the chief psychologist
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:44.600]  had signed off to confirm that Epstein was not suicidal. In the days before his death,
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:49.960]  prison insiders and other guards have come out and said that he was in quote good spirits.
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:55.680]  He had warned guards and this is all in mainstream media reports that others had tried to kill
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:10:00.640]  him were planning to kill him. He told guards, he told prisoners. Now we learned from Fox
[2:10:00.640 --> 2:10:06.240]  News. He was reportedly considering cooperating in naming names that had reduced his sentence.
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:11.360]  We actually had that report weeks ago where he was looking at a reduced five year sentence
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:16.000]  if he coughed up the names of some of these powerful men that are quoted in the documents
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:21.120]  that came out last week. And suddenly he turns up dead. Of course, we have a media that has
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:26.840]  spun the biggest conspiracy theory of the past two decades probably in Russian collusion
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:33.080]  now saying that talking about Epstein possibly having been killed as a result of a conspiracy
[2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:37.760]  is hate speech. They're now removing YouTube videos which talk about that. So maybe they'll
[2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:43.480]  remove mine later on today, even though it's got the most 1984 thing you could ever imagine.
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:47.240]  I mean, that's right out of 1984, two plus two equals five, but it's not even that's
[2:10:47.240 --> 2:10:52.040]  even more complex. We're dealing with one plus one equals three right now. The official
[2:10:52.040 --> 2:10:55.400]  narrative says one plus one equals three. I'm not even going to sit here and say who's
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:10:58.640]  responsible for it because at this point I'm open minded. It could be anything. Again,
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:04.640]  I could see how he cuts a deal and they basically do a body switch and say, oh, he's dead. Put
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:08.320]  him in witness protection. I could also see he could easily have been killed. There are
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:12.520]  a lot of people very powerful that want him killed too. So I'm just sitting here saying,
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:17.240]  okay, the official narrative is one plus one equals three. I know one plus one doesn't
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:22.280]  equal three. So I'm going to find out how this one plus one actually equals two. And
[2:11:22.280 --> 2:11:26.760]  don't you think this is a huge opportunity? I mean, nobody is buying this. I mean, no,
[2:11:26.760 --> 2:11:30.040]  the average person that's not even political isn't buying this. They're like, oh, okay.
[2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:35.560]  I mean, people need to see how the mainstream media is trying to cover up and how the real
[2:11:35.560 --> 2:11:39.920]  story here is much more interesting than, oh, financier commits suicide in jail.
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:45.680]  Yeah. And as he said, once they get a lockdown on the narrative, it's going to disappear
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:51.640]  after a couple of days. Now we see the emerging narrative is that the staffing was inadequate.
[2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:57.000]  So we know he was taken off suicide watch a week after allegedly trying to commit suicide.
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:12:02.200]  But even if he was not on suicide watch, which is what they claim, as per their procedure
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:08.320]  in the jail, they have to check on him every 30 minutes. Now we found out it was hours
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:13.440]  before his death that nobody checked on him. Oh, but the staff are overworked and they're
[2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:18.800]  inadequate. So now they're throwing the jail guards under the bus, even though in this
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:24.560]  same correctional facility, this jail, they've had one suicide in 21 years, which was the
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:30.120]  death of a drug kingpin in 1998. They've had a bunch of other suicide attempts, but in
[2:12:30.120 --> 2:12:34.400]  every single other attempt, obviously wasn't suicide. Unless he literally banged his head
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:39.080]  against the wall for 30 minutes until it was a pulp, which was not true because we saw
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:43.720]  the pictures. There's no way this was suicide. So Paul, let me ask you this. I mean, let's
[2:12:43.720 --> 2:12:50.440]  really try to war game this out here. I mean, to me, I think there's only three potential
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:56.200]  options here. And that's that either he cut a deal with the justice department or the
[2:12:56.200 --> 2:13:00.240]  Trump administration or whoever. And he said, look, they're going to try to kill me. They
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:04.320]  obviously knew that's true. So we cut a deal and they said, fine, we're going to do a dead
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:08.880]  man switch, pull you out of here, claim your dead, put you in witness protection, and then
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:16.480]  you can cooperate with us during this investigation to, and this is the craziest one. I mean, how
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:22.200]  many people would have to be involved in actually killing Epstein for this to go off without
[2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:25.520]  anybody getting caught? I mean, you had to have people in the jail. You have to have
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:29.160]  people in the federal government. You have to have people just in the medical. I mean,
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:32.520]  literally you have, how many people would you have to get to cooperate to actually pull
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:37.960]  this off and either have him killed in jail or sneak him out of there to get him back
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:43.480]  to whatever? I mean, so, so which one do you think is more likely to me, both are more
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:48.520]  likely than suicide? I mean, there's another option that maybe they threatened to kill
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:52.120]  his family. I don't know how close he was to his family or how exposed they were, but
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:57.000]  maybe they threatened to kill his family and got to him that way and basically forced him
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:01.480]  into a, a Gary Webb type situation where, you know, he shot himself in the head. What
[2:14:01.480 --> 2:14:06.680]  two or three times apparently, but just the basic facts of it, it's almost impossible to
[2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:12.320]  commit suicide. What did he hang himself with? You've had ex inmates of that same correctional
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:17.400]  center in New York saying literally the bedsheets are like paper. They're not strong enough
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:22.200]  to hold anything. They would just tear if anyone tried to hang themselves with the bedsheets.
[2:14:22.200 --> 2:14:26.200]  You know, he's had all the shoelaces, all the rope, whatever's in there removed. The
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:30.840]  floor and the ceiling, the ceiling is like nine feet high. There's literally nothing
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:35.560]  to hang yourself on. There's no hook. There's no anything in there. And this is from people
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:39.880]  who have been in that prison for years who have come out and told this to the media.
[2:14:39.880 --> 2:14:45.840]  So just the basic mechanics of how he possibly did it, given all this kind of override, so
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:49.840]  incompetence, they didn't check on him. Even if no one was checking on him, how did he physically
[2:14:49.840 --> 2:14:54.480]  manage it when it's impossible according to the prisoners that were in there? So I don't
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:57.680]  know. A lot more is going to come out over the next few days. But as he said, they're
[2:14:57.680 --> 2:15:01.860]  going to, they're going to put the lid on it. What they're still doing with Rubio and
[2:15:01.860 --> 2:15:07.200]  Joe Scarborough and these others is ludicrously claiming that Russian agents killed him to
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:11.600]  cover up for Trump and the Trump body count. What is the Trump body count in comparison
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:17.160]  to the Clinton body count? Trump was the only high profile guy who distanced himself from
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:22.000]  Epstein the first time he found out about this alleged sex trafficking. Nobody else
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.400]  did. Trump helped the lawyers of the victims of Epstein. So the fact they're still trying
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:32.920]  to pin this on Trump. You know, I can't even imagine. I mean, I don't get it in my personal
[2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:36.800]  life here, but it's like, like, I can't even imagine what Trump is going through. I mean,
[2:15:36.800 --> 2:15:43.600]  I triple check quadruple think anybody I even talk to or get close to, I can't even imagine
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:47.720]  Donald Trump. So he's not hopping into bed with these minors because someone's trying
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:52.160]  to, from Epstein Island, trying to get him over there. He's not, he is not even in his
[2:15:52.160 --> 2:15:58.200]  personal profile to ever do anything like that. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:04.040]  but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive. Forget bunkers. You're not a live underground

[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:04.320]  all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you. We run during the breaks

[2:19:59.560 --> 2:20:27.560]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:33.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. Owen Shroyer, Paul Joseph Watson with you. Just
[2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:38.160]  what an epic time to be alive. You almost just want Black Sabbath to tell the story,
[2:20:38.160 --> 2:20:49.400]  don't you? You can't even summarize it properly with vernacular. You need music and horns
[2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:58.160]  and passion and just noise that communicates universally with humans. No language. Can
[2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:03.800]  you describe what's going on? But Paul Joseph Watson, look at this headline from the New
[2:21:03.800 --> 2:21:09.880]  York Times. You want to talk about irony. Epstein's suicide conspiracies show how our
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:14.840]  information system is poisoned from Charlie Warrzell, one of the biggest trash journalists
[2:21:14.840 --> 2:21:19.760]  out there, as you well know. But isn't this hilarious, Paul? The Epstein suicide shows
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:24.920]  how our information system is poisoned. Oh, not the lies about 9-11 to get us into war.
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:29.320]  Not the lies about the Gulf of Tonkin. Not the lies about weapons of mass destruction.
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:33.680]  Not the lies about babies and incubators. Not the lies about Russian collusion. Oh, no,
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:38.980]  it's people that question the Epstein's suicide that don't believe one plus one equals three
[2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:44.400]  from Charlie Warrzell at the New York Times. I mean, what a pathetic puke Charlie Warrzell
[2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:48.240]  is. But again, the irony to say that our information system is poisoned because people question
[2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:52.660]  an official narrative that doesn't make sense when the New York Times spreads false information
[2:21:52.660 --> 2:21:58.240]  that leads us to war. Boy, you could cut that irony with a dull knife, Paul.
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:06.200]  Well, we have to recall that the characterization of quote conspiracy theories as a dangerous
[2:22:06.200 --> 2:22:12.440]  assault, a fake news assault on reality goes right back to George W. Bush right after 9-11
[2:22:12.440 --> 2:22:16.280]  and right before the invasion of Iraq, which of course, as we mentioned many times, is
[2:22:16.280 --> 2:22:22.280]  the biggest, most harmful fake news narrative that was pushed by the New York Times above
[2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:28.240]  many others. The most harmful, it led to the invasion of Iraq. It led to the rise of ISIS.
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:34.480]  It led to the invasion of Libya, again, based on a hoax to do with armed jihadists being
[2:22:34.480 --> 2:22:39.760]  peaceful revolutionary comrades that we had to go in there and support. The biggest, most
[2:22:39.760 --> 2:22:45.520]  harmful examples of fake news in terms of deaths, in terms of driving Christians out
[2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:51.120]  of entire countries and regions, in terms of the complete loss of faith in institutions
[2:22:51.120 --> 2:22:55.800]  in the West and in the United States, which by the way is leading the West towards a horrific
[2:22:55.800 --> 2:23:00.840]  civil war scenario that no one wants to see. But we are not responsible for that, for questioning
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:05.360]  Epstein or questioning any of the other of these highly questionable events when they
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:11.080]  literally launched the biggest fake news hoax as the most harmful, the most damaging. Whereas
[2:23:11.080 --> 2:23:17.440]  we were put in our articles like this weeks ago, economists Jeffrey Epstein will be killed
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:22.760]  in jail. Another one, Epstein in danger of being murdered by powerful people before his
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:28.560]  trial, says victim's lawyer, Ann Coulter, move Epstein to a supermax prison before he
[2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:33.560]  is suicided. She made the point that there are people on death row in that New York correctional
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:39.480]  facility that will take a deal to be involved in a potential murder of Epstein. We predicted
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:44.560]  this, numerous of the prominent people predicted it, it happened exactly as predicted. Oh no,
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:48.680]  but where dangerous simply because we got out ahead of the story when again they've
[2:23:48.680 --> 2:23:55.000]  been responsible for the most foundational, most harmful fake news stories in modern human
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:58.480]  history yet they have the nerve to point the finger at us.
[2:23:58.480 --> 2:24:05.000]  Well, this is like a weatherman or like there's a huge storm, like a huge hurricane is building
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:11.480]  out, you know, in the Atlantic Ocean. And so people are like, oh, hey, there's a huge
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:15.880]  hurricane that's about to hit the coast and the Atlantic coast, we better flee. And then
[2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:20.640]  Charlie Warzel goes on the TV and says, there's no hurricane coming, nothing to see here.
[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:24.760]  And then the hurricane literally comes through and just like levels multiple cities. And
[2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:30.720]  then Charlie Warzel goes on there and said, there was a slight windstorm, barely any wind,
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:34.200]  no rain at all. And everyone's like, what? There's a massive hurricane that just leveled
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:38.280]  10 cities. What the hell is this guy talking about? I mean, okay, Charlie Warzel one plus
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:41.960]  one equals three, doesn't it? At the New York Times, I mean, it's just unbelievable. But
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:47.600]  Paul, do you agree that this window of opportunity to wake people up so that they can see mainstream
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:50.840]  media lies, they can see the coverups that are taking place, they can see the shadow
[2:24:50.840 --> 2:24:56.200]  government and the power it has? I mean, we're talking about, I mean, if Epstein was actually
[2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:01.560]  killed, I mean, we're talking about a shadow government here that has more power than a
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:06.080]  president and attorney general and an entire correctional facility combined.
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:12.240]  We're talking about a global elite that literally is run by pedophiles Epstein, not even being
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:16.960]  at the apex of it. We have to remember, you mentioned the video pedophiles rule the world,
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:23.200]  which I made actually in 2017 over two years ago now, going through literally every major
[2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:29.680]  pedo ring boss in every major European country, some in South America to every single time
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:35.200]  it leads back to the global political elite, to judges, to police chiefs, to people in
[2:25:35.200 --> 2:25:40.520]  the entertainment industry, the people they burn people like Dutro in Belgium, who got
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:45.080]  caught running a pedophile ring for the elite in Belgium, every single time they burn the
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:49.240]  underling, the underling gets sent down or the underling gets killed. It's the same in
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:54.960]  every single country. So for to come to that realization, and the media plays these games
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:26:00.400]  where they're like, Oh, Pete's the gate disproves completely the fact that elites would be connected
[2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:05.840]  to pedophilia. No, they're connected to pedophilia in every single example in every court case
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:10.760]  in every country when any of this comes out. So it's about changing that narrative. It's
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.480]  about burning the underling Epstein Epstein was the underling, some speculation that he
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:20.920]  was working on behalf of a state actor as a blackmailing operation for them. So again,
[2:26:20.920 --> 2:26:26.240]  it's about burning the underlings. And just to get back to the nitty gritty of it, they
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:30.160]  literally put him in a straight jacket. This is what they do in this prison. They put you
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:35.080]  in a straight jacket where you can barely even move. They put you in there with a steel
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:39.360]  bed that's fixed to the floor. There's no light fixture. There are no bars. There are
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:44.480]  no instruments of death. The guy who was in there with Epstein at the same time said they
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:49.760]  give you rubber pens because they fear you may hurt yourself with the pen. They literally
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:55.040]  have no instruments of death to carry out a suicide bid, which is why they've had only
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:02.000]  one successful one in 21 years. All the others were prevented. You've got the highest profile
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:06.520]  sex trafficker billionaire pedo in there. The guy you want to watch the most, the guy
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:12.160]  who already allegedly tried to kill himself three weeks ago, they take all the surveillance
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:18.160]  off, they take all the guards off, and he suddenly winds out dead. And now the indictment,
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:22.820]  because it didn't name any individuals which came out last week, protects those individuals
[2:27:22.820 --> 2:27:27.120]  from being named. There are a lot more documents to come, but it does now look like that those
[2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:32.160]  individuals will be protected. So of course, we're going to ask questions of this without
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:37.640]  being finger wagged at and called extremists and called conspiracy theorists and literally
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:41.840]  put in the same bracket as terrorists and mass shooters, which is what the media is
[2:27:41.840 --> 2:27:47.640]  trying to do. You take Wasel, for example, Owen, he led the charge to de-platform info
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:52.920]  wars and others based on nebulous accusations of hate speech. Now they're taking it to the
[2:27:52.920 --> 2:27:58.400]  next level where they say, if you engage in fake news, if you circulate fake news, now
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:03.640]  you get de-platformed. Who decides what's fake news? The fake news media who are responsible
[2:28:03.640 --> 2:28:08.040]  for the biggest most harmful examples of fake news in modern human history. It's a good
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:11.040]  little game they've got going, isn't it?
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:17.440]  Well, I mean, look, there's zero doubt that they did a stand down order on Epstein. I
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.280]  don't know where the orders came from, but they obviously did a stand down order. Now,
[2:28:21.280 --> 2:28:24.560]  you know, just, it's like, I wonder about a guy like Warzell. Doesn't it make you wonder
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:28.320]  about a guy like Warzell that tries to stand up and cover up mass pedophile networks?
[2:28:28.320 --> 2:28:31.080]  Doesn't it make you wonder about a Warzell?
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:35.800]  Makes you wonder. And his, his friend over at CNN, Oliver Darcy, again, another loser
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:40.960]  who has basically kicked out of the conservative movement, then had his revenge, his resentment
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:44.880]  by de-platforming of the conservatives. So yeah, I mean, come on, Warzell. What is Charlie
[2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:48.600]  Warzell so afraid of? Like did Epstein have dirt on him or something? I mean, come on,
[2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:53.040]  Warzell. One plus one doesn't equal three. One plus one equals two, Warzell. One plus
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:55.320]  one is not equal three. Why are you telling us it does?
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:29:00.240]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:05.440]  me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and used to party a little
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:11.760]  too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:17.040]  fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking and
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:22.440]  drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment
[2:29:22.440 --> 2:29:27.800]  advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new
[2:29:27.800 --> 2:29:33.320]  habits and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the

[2:29:56.280 --> 2:30:02.200]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[2:30:02.200 --> 2:30:06.640]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:10.400]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation. And today, the communist
[2:30:10.400 --> 2:30:16.080]  Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:21.320]  in polls, support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war, once China put
[2:30:21.320 --> 2:30:26.040]  pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful. Americans aren't going to be bullied and we
[2:30:26.040 --> 2:30:30.880]  aren't going to back down. So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world
[2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:34.960]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:40.440]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and
[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:45.960]  NewsWars.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are
[2:30:45.960 --> 2:30:57.160]  the light and the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[2:30:57.160 --> 2:31:01.160]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[2:31:01.160 --> 2:31:05.040]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements. And that if you go back five, six years ago,
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:08.120]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:11.600]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were. And I'd have
[2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:15.240]  doctors on an expert to explain why they were so good. And instead, the last few years,
[2:31:15.240 --> 2:31:18.440]  I'm like, hey, we need to really support us. Or they'll shut us down. The biggest thing
[2:31:18.440 --> 2:31:21.040]  people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:23.440]  they were. And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:28.600]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements. No, under federal
[2:31:28.600 --> 2:31:34.080]  law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:37.680]  no jurisdiction and won't look at it. But then they say you've got to say it's not approved
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:42.120]  by them. And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate
[2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:45.640]  it and do different things. And a lot of drugs work great. They have side effects, not with
[2:31:45.640 --> 2:31:50.240]  mother nature, but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest. Info
[2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:58.000]  or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. If you want to bet
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:02.440]  on your future, if you want to bet on Americana, if you want to bet on not being run by the
[2:32:02.440 --> 2:32:06.720]  chai comms with Senate and House hearings now on how they literally fund the Democrats
[2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:10.240]  and MSM and CNN, the Chinese government does. It's all coming out.
[2:32:10.240 --> 2:32:12.840]  Democrats aren't gonna stop. They're trying to cause a civil war right now. Like we're
[2:32:12.840 --> 2:32:16.480]  starting to get some purchase, trying to start a fire. They got some fire going all the physical
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:20.720]  attacks, shootings, bombings, ice facilities, getting attacked, dead people everywhere. It's
[2:32:20.720 --> 2:32:24.800]  on folks. And if you think it's bad now, if they really get traction, it's going to go
[2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:28.480]  insane. So now more than you've ever done yourself for me, for everybody, spread the
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:32.800]  word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV, tell folks about info wars.com
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:36.960]  or slash show. But that said, I want to fight hard. And I need you to buy the products at

[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:05.360]  by the world famous Alex Jones show 11am to 3pm central weekdays. And then I normally
[2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:11.640]  host the war room from 3pm central to 6pm central weekdays with a bunch of great guests
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:18.760]  and all the fun stuff we do there. And that's all at info wars.com slash show. That's all
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:22.440]  in the midst of the censorship. I'm not allowed on YouTube. I'm not allowed to expand the
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:27.920]  work that I do and market on YouTube or Facebook or Twitter, my show, the war room. So it all
[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:32.400]  comes down to word of mouth. It all comes down to you, the audience, telling friends
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:36.040]  and family about that broadcast, telling friends and family about info wars.com slash show.
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:44.800]  And I'm telling you, I wish I wish I could do a better job at explaining this or vocalizing
[2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:58.320]  this, but I always make sports analogies. So I'll just do that. Imagine your let's say
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:05.160]  a hockey player and somebody has just passed you the puck. You get past the puck for a
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:13.160]  shot on net, say 10 times a game and somebody just passed you the puck and the goalie isn't
[2:35:13.160 --> 2:35:19.400]  even in the net. The goalie's way on the other side of his crease, not even on the net and
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:26.360]  you've just got a wide open net to shoot at. All you got to do is bury it. That's where
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:32.240]  we're at right now with the 17 story or imagine you're a football player and you're running
[2:35:32.240 --> 2:35:37.760]  down the field. Normally you've got two defenders on you tight. You're wide open down the field
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.840]  streaking down the sideline. All they got to do is pass it to you and it's a touchdown
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:48.240]  or imagine like a carnival game where you have to throw the ball through the hole to
[2:35:48.240 --> 2:35:52.360]  win the prize. The hole's normally a foot big and you got to toss the football through
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:59.200]  the hole about a foot big. Well, today the hole is 20 feet big, but you got to throw
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:06.000]  the ball through it. Nobody is believing this official FC narrative. Nobody believes the
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:12.320]  suicide narrative. A lot of people haven't heard about info wars.com. This is when we
[2:36:12.320 --> 2:36:16.800]  throw the ball through the window. You see, this is when we hit the wide open receiver.
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:25.840]  This is when we score on a wide open net, but you have to shoot the puck. You have to throw
[2:36:25.840 --> 2:36:30.800]  the ball. It's like, I believe it was, it was either Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:34.480]  said you miss all the shots you don't take. Well, whatever the point is, if you don't
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:41.160]  take this shot, we miss it. Huge window of opportunity right now. Nobody's buying the
[2:36:41.160 --> 2:36:47.840]  obscene thing and people don't know where to go to get the best coverage of it. So you
[2:36:47.840 --> 2:36:50.800]  have to tell them info wars.com slash show. You hear people talking about it. You hear
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:54.640]  them not believing it. Say, Hey, check out the Alex Jones show. Check out David Knight.
[2:36:54.640 --> 2:36:58.320]  Check out the war room throwing Troyer. They've got the best guests. They've got the most details.
[2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:02.320]  They've been covering this for years. And then people go listen to us and they say, Wow,
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:06.080]  that stuff makes some sense. And then they start looking to all the other stuff. And
[2:37:06.080 --> 2:37:09.760]  then they say, Wow, why did they lie about this group over time? Why is this news organization
[2:37:09.760 --> 2:37:20.640]  censored everywhere? You know, it is a miracle by God that we're even still on air. But we're
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:26.720]  still here. So please tell your friends and family. Tell them about info wars.com. Look,
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:31.480]  I just spent five minutes supposed to be plugging our products so that we could still exist.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:36.280]  And I'm more obsessed with the truth and information getting out there to awaken the public. I'm
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:44.400]  just saying, just share the stuff, man. It's free. It's like the story I saw today from
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:52.240]  deadline us pay TV subscriber loses more than triple to 1.5 million and quarter number two.
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:58.720]  So nobody's paying for news anymore because it's no good. People don't believe the cable
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:03.640]  news. They don't want to pay for this crap anymore. Tell them about info wars.com slash
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.680]  show. Share the links. Tell them while we're banned. Tell them, Hey, the best option coverage
[2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:17.160]  is here. It's just, I just know it. I mean, if we miss this window of opportunity, I don't
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:20.360]  know if they'll ever be a big one and there probably will be because God always provides.
[2:38:20.360 --> 2:38:25.560]  It's just, I just know the windows there and I just know all you have to do is just, it's
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:30.800]  like, I mean, all you have to do is just throw the ball. It's an empty net and hockey. Just,
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:35.520]  just push the puck into the net. It's just, it's wide open. Nobody's believing the Epstein
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:41.200]  thing and mainstream news is telling them it's, oh yeah, suicide, financier, suicide,
[2:38:41.200 --> 2:38:45.960]  financier. That's fake and suicide. That's fake and everybody knows it's fake, but they
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:52.600]  don't know where to go. So please tell them about info wars.com slash show and please
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:57.400]  always support us by shopping at info wars store.com where we have huge specials going.
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:01.680]  That's the final day. Now look, I blew it here. I was supposed to give out the phone number
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:11.880]  and take calls. It's just, let's go ahead and just open up the phone lines. 1-877-789-ALIX
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:19.880]  877-789-ALIX. We're going to squeeze in, I swear. I'm going to squeeze in as many calls.
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:23.720]  Just be ready to get your point out in 60 seconds and I'm going to just hammer calls
[2:39:23.720 --> 2:39:28.520]  in the next segment, but 60 seconds in the next segment and the one after that, maybe
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:35.200]  some calls with Jail Salanti coming up, but let me just do this because I got so much
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:39.760]  news and you can't even get through it. But let me just pile drive through news. I mean,
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:47.600]  it's all crazy. Ian Miles Chong shared this. Democrat activist David Brock share blue operation
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:51.120]  is allegedly giving number, excuse me, members of the press affiliated with share blue. They're
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:56.520]  talking points on Epstein. Here's a leaked email. They allegedly sent to share blue stalwarts.
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.360]  Rollcon refers to role playing as conservative. Now these documents are public. They were
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:08.240]  shared leaked emails. Alex Jones literally because he, look, I don't know how to say
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:13.240]  but literally like, I can't tell you how many times Alex used to talk about how Brock literally
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:19.480]  sends out the talking points to the mainstream media. We now have it in the emails. We already
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:25.680]  had it in the wiki leaks, but it's just more and more and more and more info wars has proven
[2:40:25.680 --> 2:40:32.080]  right next year's news today. So yes, David Brock is telling the media what to say about
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:39.880]  Jeffrey Epstein. Yeah, it's called fake news. How about this one? Eric Sprackland shares
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:45.600]  this on Twitter. Google trends now show Trump body count searches almost exclusively are
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:51.640]  coming from California while Clinton body count are coming from across the United States.
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:56.160]  And he highlights how this shows how we need electoral college, but the real thing is just
[2:40:56.160 --> 2:41:04.560]  shows you how controlled Google is and Twitter is when Clinton body count is like number
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:13.280]  one trend and they try to say it's Trump body count. FBI can't hack into Dayton shooter
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:19.520]  Conor Betts phone. Well, isn't that convenient? Talk about a load of crap. The FBI doesn't
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:23.760]  even need to hack into his phone. They're already in there. There's already backdoors
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:28.320]  built into every piece of technology. It's called vault seven leaks, but they think the
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:33.880]  average American is so dumb. Oh, yeah, the FBI couldn't get into Conor Betts phone. Folks,
[2:41:33.880 --> 2:41:37.120]  they're telling you that because he was such an avowed leftist and Tifa member, they don't
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:44.480]  want it to come out. Las Vegas, neo-Nazi charged with plot to bomb gay club in synagogue. Now,
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:50.480]  you may ask, wait a second. Las Vegas, this is from ABC News. Las Vegas, neo-Nazi charged
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:54.120]  with plot to bomb gay club synagogue. Why wouldn't the media be reporting this, making
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:42:02.840]  this a big deal? Why? Because he was a socialist. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Part of the nationalist socialist
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:08.040]  movement. So it almost worked. It almost works. Oh, white nationalist neo-Nazi. Let's claim
[2:42:08.040 --> 2:42:12.840]  he just tried to bomb everybody. Oh, but he's a socialist, not mainstream news. See how
[2:42:12.840 --> 2:42:19.920]  that works? Story from zero hedge. Actually, let's just do this one in the, uh, in the
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:25.520]  light of the last story from Washington Post. Federal judge awards 700,000 to former American
[2:42:25.520 --> 2:42:30.560]  university student targeted in neo-Nazi troll form. Uh, the funny thing is this guy, Anglin,
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:35.760]  it is the one who got charged here. People claim I'm actually him. They literally think
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:39.680]  I had some sort of surgery to be this guy. Okay, is this now proof I'm not? Uh, but second
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:47.680]  of all, this woman gets $700,000 from a troll storm. Excuse me. We got totally banned off
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:55.200]  the internet. How much money do we get? How about like 700 million? I mean, literally.
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:59.400]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Troyer. I love all
[2:42:59.400 --> 2:43:04.040]  the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you. We run during the breaks, a lot
[2:43:04.040 --> 2:43:09.160]  of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads show. You think you don't want to
[2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:13.560]  hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line. We're barely paying
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:17.360]  the bills here and I want to expand the face. The globalists not contract. I don't want
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:22.720]  them to win. So listen, you've got this guarantee for me. We saw enough product. We'll have
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:26.760]  less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:31.640]  money. But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2. These
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:35.440]  will change your life. Go check out the turmeric products. Check out the water filtration, air

[2:44:56.880 --> 2:45:01.480]  Without your support, we won't be here. And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:04.400]  that you've kept us in the game. I mean, I want to stay in this game. I want to take
[2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:09.320]  the globalist on. Total transparency is our whole operation. If I bring in $35 million,
[2:45:09.320 --> 2:45:12.680]  half of that's to cost the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much. I don't
[2:45:12.680 --> 2:45:16.360]  care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products. We got coffee, we got
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:21.240]  fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:25.000]  But ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months. For whatever reason, this became
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:29.680]  the most popular fish oil. It's totally full of the bottle. And it is the strongest, purest
[2:45:29.680 --> 2:45:34.280]  krill oil. And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive
[2:45:34.280 --> 2:45:39.000]  laboratory process to remove mercury. Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:42.960]  you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real. It's
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:46.760]  been boiled, it's been rillent, it's been homogenized. This is not good. This, ladies
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:51.160]  and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere. Real krill
[2:45:51.160 --> 2:45:56.320]  oil folks is red. It's not yellow. It's not milky. This is nothing but krill oil.
[2:45:56.320 --> 2:46:01.280]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:05.960]  act. And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag, because we still
[2:46:05.960 --> 2:46:09.520]  loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it. But
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:14.840]  now they're trying to take it out of schools. They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[2:46:14.840 --> 2:46:18.600]  Weird white leftist that won a virtue singular, pulling down American flags and running up
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:23.800]  Mexican flags. This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing. So now it is
[2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:28.400]  a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear
[2:46:28.400 --> 2:46:33.480]  the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag. And particularly when
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:39.400]  it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com. So whatever
[2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:44.640]  you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face, all over
[2:46:44.640 --> 2:46:48.320]  not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol
[2:46:48.320 --> 2:47:16.520]  of freedom against globalism.
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:28.800]  I hope we see the other side of this. I hope it's not just a light shining, because we
[2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:33.840]  have a huge opportunity here to really expose the shadow government, folks. I got all this
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:37.360]  other news I want to get to. Let me put a bow on the end of what I was getting into.
[2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:43.600]  Then we're going to your calls, I promise. You've got this lady awarded $700,000 because
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:49.240]  an individual told people to target her for trolling on social media. She gets $700,000
[2:47:49.240 --> 2:48:02.560]  for that. You've got people that threaten Alexandra Cortez on Facebook being investigated
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:09.040]  and arrested. And then just to highlight all the hypocrisy, you know, over a weekend in
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:14.320]  Chicago, 46 were shot, including an eight-year-old girl. You had a fire in Pennsylvania that
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:18.920]  killed four kids or five kids, and it could have been prevented with a smoke detector.
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:22.480]  But you notice the media doesn't talk about that. I thought the media cared about stopping
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.520]  gun violence. Why don't they cover Chicago? I thought the media cared about unnecessary
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:31.080]  child death. Well, why don't they report on putting fire detectors and smoke detectors
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:35.440]  in your home? Because the media doesn't care. They only report on something when it's advantageous.
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:40.480]  But talk about a double standard here where if you threaten AOC on Facebook, you get arrested.
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:45.680]  And if you have a troll farm that targets an individual, you pay $700,000 in fines. Infowars
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:52.200]  got freaking removed. Alex Jones got kicked off of social media. Where's our fine for
[2:48:52.200 --> 2:48:57.920]  targeted harassment? People go flag our stuff to get kicked off. Where's our fines for targeted
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:03.640]  harassment? People threaten us all the time. How come they don't get arrested? Sick of
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:07.400]  the double standards. And then they say, finance seer Jeffrey Epstein. So the mainstream media
[2:49:07.400 --> 2:49:13.600]  literally covers up for industrial level pedophilia. All right. Let's go to your phone calls. Let's
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:21.000]  go to George in New Mexico. Go ahead, George. Hey, what's up, Owen? Yeah, man. This is truly
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:26.320]  a tragic event, man. You know, there's so many questions unanswered that need to be
[2:49:26.320 --> 2:49:32.760]  answered around this mysterious depth, you know, of Epstein. And it's just, it comes
[2:49:32.760 --> 2:49:40.760]  as no coincidence just a day before, you know, the documents being unsealed. And, and, you
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:45.560]  know, all of a sudden we get this, this, you know, all the events leading up to it is just
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:51.600]  there's like why put on suicide watch was he, you know, he had made reports that he, you
[2:49:51.600 --> 2:49:57.640]  know, was actually attempted murder on his life, you know, not to mention the blackout
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:05.320]  that same exact night in Manhattan that occurred, you know, it's, it, it's just like, it's,
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:09.960]  it's totally like in city is just, you know, the, the whole where, where's the footage
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:13.600]  of the cameras? Well, exactly. That's the thing. This is the most one plus one equals
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:18.160]  three narrative we've ever been sold ever, ever. And again, it's not two plus two equals
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:21.200]  five. That's a little more advanced. This is one plus one equals two. Thanks for the
[2:50:21.200 --> 2:50:26.680]  call, George. So yeah, I don't see anybody buying this. Look, the more, the more I think
[2:50:26.680 --> 2:50:30.960]  the more I look into it, it's clear there was a stand down order given to stand down
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:36.040]  on Jeffrey Epstein. Now, whether that was given by good forces or bad forces, I don't
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:43.560]  know, but clearly there was a stand down order. Let's go now to William in Alaska. Go ahead,
[2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:47.920]  William. How's it going, Owen? Good. Thank you.
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:53.480]  So yeah, dude, get back on this Epstein thing. It nobody's going to buy this at all. This
[2:50:53.480 --> 2:50:58.600]  is, this is definitely a smelly pig. And, and again, we're not going to take this week.
[2:50:58.600 --> 2:51:02.760]  We're tired of being told the same 2D narrative like you were talking about earlier. And like
[2:51:02.760 --> 2:51:07.360]  you just said, one plus, this is, this is, we're not going to take it. And number two,
[2:51:07.360 --> 2:51:12.840]  the opportunity that we have right now is that nobody is buying this. Nobody, nobody
[2:51:12.840 --> 2:51:19.480]  I know, even my wife was like, are you kidding me? Yes, here it is. And right after again,
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:25.160]  that's we go to his documents being released. And even if he was or not killed or taken out
[2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:31.520]  or put under a protection, why, why, why is there a two tier justice system for the equals
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:36.080]  or the elites and the elitist for the people that are well connected? If I, you know, like
[2:51:36.080 --> 2:51:40.520]  Anthony Wiener, if I sex with a 15 year old right now, I'd have been arrested immediately.
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:44.160]  I don't get to go to some sex therapy camp in somewhere for a couple months.
[2:51:44.160 --> 2:51:48.080]  Well, here's what I don't understand too. Thanks for the call again, folks. I 60 seconds.
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:54.440]  I'm jumping, but it's like, it just shows how the average American and maybe it's worldwide.
[2:51:54.440 --> 2:51:58.880]  It's just the average person is just in such a trance. And literally people are crying
[2:51:58.880 --> 2:52:07.800]  over Miley Cyrus's relationship right now. And it's like, how brainwashed have you been?
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:12.400]  People are more, I mean, it's just, I just can't have imagined being that lost as a human
[2:52:12.400 --> 2:52:17.680]  because I'll just leave it there. Let's go to Frank calling in from California. Go ahead,
[2:52:17.680 --> 2:52:29.240]  Alex Jones. He's our hero. Gonna reduce plastic bottle waste down to zero with Alexa pure
[2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:38.800]  command. See just how great the conspiracy of clean water can be. Wow. Combined. You are
[2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:49.520]  the info wars. We salute you. Oh, ensure Alex Jones and info wars crew info wars next year's
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:56.760]  news today action hero coming for Epstein getting the pedophile network shut down. New York
[2:52:56.760 --> 2:53:04.360]  Times says that's bad. So I guess Charlie Warsell likes pedophiles, huh? Pretty much.
[2:53:04.360 --> 2:53:08.760]  I guess something like that. Well, Frank, that was a beautiful rendition. Is there anything
[2:53:08.760 --> 2:53:13.160]  else you want to add? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I just know how you like those memeable moments.
[2:53:13.160 --> 2:53:18.280]  So I thought, you know, do a little plug for info war store. Alex Jones is now the most
[2:53:18.280 --> 2:53:25.200]  credible man in news. But yeah, I would like to just, you know, AG Barr in my personal
[2:53:25.200 --> 2:53:30.320]  opinion, he's a joke. I think it's been discussed a number of times. He's just kind of the cleanup
[2:53:30.320 --> 2:53:37.720]  man. They're kind of like you were talking about earlier about, you know, all rights
[2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:43.960]  daughter being there with the whole Russia gate deal. I mean, he really showed his cards
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:51.200]  appointing Durham. I mean, he was he was there. Durham was there with Mueller for the whole
[2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:55.840]  the whole whitey boulder deal. Well, and here's the thing about that, Frank, a great
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:02.080]  call, good points. This thing is so epic and so high up that you're going to have people
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:10.400]  flipping essentially. I don't even know if we can fully understand that yet. To be honest,
[2:54:10.400 --> 2:54:14.400]  I don't know if we ever will. But I mean, I really believe the things are that epic.
[2:54:14.400 --> 2:54:22.040]  I mean, there is a civil war happening, but it's at a very high shadowy political power
[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:28.360]  structure shadow government level that that most people couldn't even comprehend. And
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:32.360]  then that we'll probably never see or hear about. But but I really believe that's going
[2:54:32.360 --> 2:54:35.360]  on. So some of these names like a costa and bar people are like, Oh, deep state, deep
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:41.040]  state. Well, maybe maybe they're operating in good faith now. But it's it's just so epic.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:44.080]  How can you even measure any of it other than Hey, look at what's happening with Epstein.
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:49.760]  All right, let's take a call from who do we have next Jake in California. Go ahead, Jake.
[2:54:49.760 --> 2:54:56.680]  Hey, Owen, this is a little off the Epstein subject, but kind of dovetails into it. My
[2:54:56.680 --> 2:55:02.280]  brother is extremely well educated. He was a Army Ranger, and you worked at the State
[2:55:02.280 --> 2:55:10.440]  Department and then the FBI. And now he's ironically at a management position in Google.
[2:55:10.440 --> 2:55:16.640]  And my I don't know what is up with him or how to go about this, but he's so intelligent
[2:55:16.640 --> 2:55:23.520]  and has degree from Harvard and Chicago University, Booth University. But he still believes that
[2:55:23.520 --> 2:55:27.640]  mainstream media is just has a bias here. Well, let me ask you this about your brother.
[2:55:27.640 --> 2:55:32.120]  I mean, I don't want to insult him, but I've just from my experience, what that normally
[2:55:32.120 --> 2:55:39.000]  is is this elitism mentality, like, Oh, nobody could fool me. Oh, I was at Harvard. I'm the
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.040]  elite. I know everything. And so it's really a pride thing. More than anything, again,
[2:55:44.040 --> 2:55:48.200]  I don't know about your brother. It's just that's what I've noticed in kind of prideful
[2:55:48.200 --> 2:55:52.480]  elitists. I don't know if your brother's a liberal, but but liberals like, Oh, I'm that
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:57.240]  I nobody can fool me. I'm part of the Astute. I mean, it's all just a big it's all just
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:03.720]  a big facade. Yeah, I mean, and part of it is, is when everybody really started waking
[2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:09.760]  up. And I mean, I accepted Christ a long time ago, and I credit that to my initial awakening.
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:17.560]  But but in 16, I started really, you know, 15 or 2014, actually. And when I watched Hating
[2:56:17.560 --> 2:56:24.320]  Breitbart, and then I watched Endgame on that Alex made. And then it just, you know, the
[2:56:24.320 --> 2:56:29.680]  whole world just opened up to me from there. And the veil was completely torn from my eyes.
[2:56:29.680 --> 2:56:36.800]  And and I try to get my and his wife is extremely liberal and just hates my guts. And so every
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.920]  time I try to say, Hey, look at this, I'm not that I'm dissing. And he comes up with
[2:56:40.920 --> 2:56:45.400]  all these different. Well, exactly. And like I said, it's just a facade to maintain this
[2:56:45.400 --> 2:56:49.640]  elitism mentality. Like you're in the know when you're not. Thanks for the call. Let's
[2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:53.560]  take one more quick call from Kim in Maine. Go ahead, Kim.
[2:56:53.560 --> 2:56:59.840]  Yeah, on that original thing, where it's supposedly tried to commit suicide, there were scratches.
[2:56:59.840 --> 2:57:04.680]  You only get scratches if you try to remove a person's hands from your neck. Number two,
[2:57:04.680 --> 2:57:10.200]  you cannot choke yourself to death. You can choke yourself into unconsciousness, but not
[2:57:10.200 --> 2:57:13.440]  to death, right? You can't you can't try to stop breathing. Like I said, the only thing
[2:57:13.440 --> 2:57:17.760]  you can do it. And I don't know what the situation if there was like a metal or a wall, he could
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:21.960]  bang his head against or something like that. But there was no signs of that. That proves
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:25.200]  that he was not suicidal because he was trying to keep himself alive.
[2:57:25.200 --> 2:57:31.680]  Is it in me? No, no, no, I totally agree. There was clearly a stand down given the question
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:37.400]  is, was the stand down from forces of good or forces of evil? I mean, that there's no
[2:57:37.400 --> 2:57:42.080]  other way. One plus one does not equal three. We know that quit lying to us MSM, quit lying
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:45.680]  to us New York Times.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:50.600]  There are thousands of ideologies out there. Hundreds of different political systems. And
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:55.600]  most of them are funded by the globalist. Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of
[2:57:55.600 --> 2:57:59.680]  the zeitgeist. That's what a globalist are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:05.120]  I didn't invent all this. I went and researched the Renaissance Americana and what really works
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:09.800]  for humanity. And I'm simply trying to bring it back. And lo and behold, it's super popular
[2:58:09.800 --> 2:58:15.080]  like it's always been. That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:19.880]  because we have the light in the dark of the night. That's since chills up my spine. So
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:24.360]  whatever you do, continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products
[2:58:24.360 --> 2:58:28.800]  and info or store.com by spreading the articles by spreading the videos and by praying for
[2:58:28.800 --> 2:58:33.400]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment for
[2:58:33.400 --> 2:58:38.720]  myself and the whole info wars family. I want to thank all of you for what you've done because
[2:58:38.720 --> 2:58:46.640]  without you info wars is nothing. You are the info war and I salute you.
[2:58:46.640 --> 2:58:53.160]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[2:58:53.160 --> 2:58:58.720]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war. Borders are being
[2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:06.080]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged. The world is going to change and how it changes
[2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:12.080]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails. The
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:18.240]  system is vulnerable. Electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[2:59:18.240 --> 2:59:24.560]  be empty in three days. Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give
[2:59:24.560 --> 2:59:30.120]  you a fighting chance in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:36.560]  or makes you a slave to a dying system. Buy storable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water
[2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:44.240]  filter today. Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from info wars
[2:59:44.240 --> 2:59:55.320]  store.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:55.320 --> 3:00:03.200]  We now take you live to the central Texas commence every and the heart of the resistance
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:10.840]  and now your host, Owen Troyer. You know we got a lot of names from the documents and
[3:00:10.840 --> 3:00:16.880]  the victim testimony people involved with Epstein. Order. What were they up to the day
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:36.880]  that Epstein died?
[3:00:36.880 --> 3:00:43.400]  Less than 24 hours after unsealed court documents revealed that several politicians, including
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:49.760]  Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the Royal Family were implicated in the pedophile scandal
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:59.120]  of Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein dies in his jail cell while on 24 hours suicide watch. There
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:05.600]  was a camera malfunction during his alleged suicide and a pathologist connected to the
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:13.600]  JFK investigation was chosen to conduct the autopsy. For most of the world, the death
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:20.280]  of Jeffrey Epstein was a grave injustice. But for many of those implicated in the recently
[3:01:20.280 --> 3:01:27.520]  unsealed documents, it was a cause for celebration. Several Democrats and Republicans partied
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:34.680]  in Israel, home of the Mossad, which seems to be at the heart of the Epstein scandal.
[3:01:34.680 --> 3:01:43.280]  Bill and Hillary Clinton were out smiling for the cameras in Illinois. While kisses
[3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:51.880]  and hugs, Hillary and Bill was scrawled outside of Epstein's Manhattan estate. And the Queen
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:02:00.440]  of England had a lovely day with jubilant Prince Andrew. Nothing to see here, folks.
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:08.640]  Go back to sleep. There is no conspiracy. Let old acquaintances be forgotten and never
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:10.640]  brought to mind.
[3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:25.120]  Really gotta wonder why anybody in media wouldn't be questioning the official narrative. We
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:33.120]  can make assumptions, but we won't. We'll just ask why. For infowars.com, this is Greg
[3:02:33.120 --> 3:02:34.120]  Rees.
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:39.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go back to the phone lines and go to Grant in
[3:02:39.920 --> 3:02:41.920]  Iowa. Go ahead, Grant.
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:43.920]  Hey, Owen.
[3:02:43.920 --> 3:02:44.920]  Hi.
[3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:49.840]  Just wanted to point out kind of the coincidence of, you know, them doing the state and switch
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:57.840]  or whatever on early Saturday morning, which gives the lying mainstream media two days
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:03.320]  to run their BS narrative. And it'll be interesting to see what, like Tucker says tonight about
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:08.040]  it, if he's even allowed to.
[3:03:08.040 --> 3:03:10.920]  My friend sent me this thing off Reddit, too. It's a quick little text. I wanted you to
[3:03:10.920 --> 3:03:18.360]  read. It's one of the workers from the facility where he's being kept. So he says, quote,
[3:03:18.360 --> 3:03:22.480]  I'm not saying anything after this. Please do not try to dox me. But last night after
[3:03:22.480 --> 3:03:25.640]  4.15 count, they took him medical in a wheelchair.
[3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:29.080]  Yeah, right. I saw that as an anonymous post. I really don't want to put too much credence
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:32.360]  into that because it's anonymous post and who has any idea. But basically it's the same
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:39.120]  thing. It's common sense. There was clearly a stand down given to get FC now or kill him.
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:42.800]  Was it from forces of good or forces of evil? Thanks for the call, Grant. Let's squeeze one
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:47.760]  more call in here before Gerald Slenty takes over. Let's go to David calling in from Massachusetts.
[3:03:47.760 --> 3:03:52.960]  Let's go ahead, David. How are you doing? Oh, I got something that nobody's thinking
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:57.920]  about right now. Another Democrat. They don't like when school kids go on summer vacation
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:04:02.160]  because they can't stay school shooting. Now my kids are going back to school in about
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:06.720]  two weeks. And I believe that they're warming up some school shootings and they're going
[3:04:06.720 --> 3:04:10.120]  to blame it on info wars and they're going to blame it on President Trump. What do you
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:14.720]  think about that? Well, they're already doing it. I mean, they literally are already doing
[3:04:14.720 --> 3:04:19.240]  that. I mean, they tried to scrub the whole El Paso shooters history and make them out
[3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:27.880]  to be conservative. So they are literally engaging in this as we speak. I haven't heard anything
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:32.000]  about. I mean, I heard about, you know, what you're talking about, but I didn't know that
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  we're doing it great now as the FBI. David, listen to this, the FBI won't even go in to
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:46.200]  the Dayton, Ohio shooters phone or anything because they know he was a total leftist and
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:51.040]  Tifa member. Like they don't, the narrative is supposed to be Trump bad. They're the bad
[3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:57.480]  guys and Tifa is the bad guys. It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public
[3:04:57.480 --> 3:05:01.480]  arena in the public square. The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the
[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:06.680]  only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[3:05:06.680 --> 3:05:10.800]  It's not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[3:05:10.800 --> 3:05:16.400]  It is completely independent of all that. It is an old school, American 1776 style experiment
[3:05:16.400 --> 3:05:20.360]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders
[3:05:20.360 --> 3:05:24.000]  were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:28.280]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[3:05:28.280 --> 3:05:31.800]  and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:35.800]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[3:05:35.800 --> 3:05:40.360]  what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[3:05:40.360 --> 3:05:45.180]  audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[3:05:45.180 --> 3:05:49.080]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:06:14.560]  onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare and libel targeting you.
[3:06:14.560 --> 3:06:19.520]  I'm about to hand it over to Gerald Sollenti from the Trends Research Journal who is in
[3:06:19.520 --> 3:06:23.840]  his best boogie suit today. So that means he's on supermail vitality and he's going
[3:06:23.840 --> 3:06:28.200]  to be boogie in with you for the final hour of the Alex Jones show. But first I'm going
[3:06:28.200 --> 3:06:31.880]  to throw a bunch of bouncing balls into his ring. Obviously the Epstein ball is still
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:39.320]  bouncing around. But you've got Monsanto right now trying to bully people out of telling
[3:06:39.320 --> 3:06:43.560]  the truth about them and what their products have done causing people cancer and all the
[3:06:43.560 --> 3:06:49.720]  lawsuits they've covered up. CNN profiled an illegal immigrant claiming he's the best,
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:52.960]  how dare it's so sympathetic and then that guy ended up killing a man driving without
[3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:58.800]  a license. Hillary Clinton is fundraising for illegal immigrants. Now this stuff is
[3:06:58.800 --> 3:07:03.620]  more right in the Gerald's wheelhouse. Yet Bank of America raising the chance of recession
[3:07:03.620 --> 3:07:10.280]  to one in three in the next 12 months. Gerald says it's 100%. Bankruptcy filings rising across
[3:07:10.280 --> 3:07:13.920]  the country could get worse. Most of these are in democratic cities, big cities where
[3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:18.720]  people, because here's the thing, the business goes bankrupt. No individual suffers except
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:27.680]  the workers that don't get paid. And then you've got a couple developments happening
[3:07:27.680 --> 3:07:31.080]  across the nation that are very important that I think Gerald may be able to highlight
[3:07:31.080 --> 3:07:34.480]  here. But again, I'm just throwing these bouncing balls in his arena. He'll take and take them
[3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:39.880]  wherever they want. You just had a changing of the guard in Guatemala. Guatemala an election
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:45.080]  winner sets sights on changing Trump migration deal. This is huge. The new presidential
[3:07:45.080 --> 3:07:51.440]  elector elect Alejandro Guillemate is not going to work with Trump like the old leadership
[3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:55.640]  has been where they're flying, they're deporting people back to Guatemala. They're stopping
[3:07:55.640 --> 3:08:00.080]  people on this caravan in Guatemala. That's why the immigration numbers were going down
[3:08:00.080 --> 3:08:03.080]  and we were finally deporting. New president looks like he's not going to do that. And
[3:08:03.080 --> 3:08:11.200]  then Argentine election surprise triggers crash in peso and bond sell off. So I really
[3:08:11.200 --> 3:08:23.320]  wanted to get Gerald's take on Mauricio Macri, the new president of Argentina. And what this
[3:08:23.320 --> 3:08:26.400]  election means, Gerald Salenti, take it over.
[3:08:26.400 --> 3:08:36.200]  Thank you, Owen. I want to pick up first where we left off with Epstein. And this is the
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:48.960]  story in today's Wall Street Journal. Conspiracy theories fly online over Epstein's death.
[3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:55.960]  The death of Jeffrey Epstein set off a wave of conspiracy theories online that demonstrate
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:09:04.320]  both how social media fuels misinformation and threatens to erode public acceptance of
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:11.560]  the results of any investigation. I can't use the word, but it's BS, what they're saying
[3:09:11.560 --> 3:09:19.840]  here. Conspiracy theory, how about a conspiracy theory that the cat killed himself? Could that
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:29.600]  be a conspiracy theory? I'd like you to play a clip that we did on two weeks ago at the
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:37.560]  end of July talking about what would happen with Epstein and the people that would hire
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:46.280]  the mob to get them out. So if you could play that right now, like this guy, Jeffrey Epstein
[3:09:46.280 --> 3:09:54.520]  built a fortune of more than a half billion dollars leveraging unusually close relationships
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:04.080]  with a powerful small group of rich individuals over four decades, hanging out in the club
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:16.680]  with all the other sickos in that kind of club. Yeah, his room is that they're gonna kill
[3:10:16.680 --> 3:10:22.000]  this guy. You know, all the stuff. There you got it. The room is that they're gonna kill
[3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  this guy.
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:25.680]  Gerald, Gerald, you're taking over here. It's just so funny because I almost want to go
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:30.160]  grab the clip. The crew, the crew may be able to find it of Joe Biggs and I on Friday
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:36.720]  saying the exact same thing. Everybody knew it was coming, Gerald. This is two weeks ago.
[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:42.480]  Conspiracy theory. How about this, your little slimmers out there that are telling us, quote,
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:47.960]  that we have to accept we're eroding public acceptance of the BS they're shoving down
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:52.960]  our throat. To me, it's conspiracy theory that the cat killed himself. I mean, this
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:11:01.200]  is such BS. They slaughtered the guy. You don't screw with the Clintons in the mob.
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:04.400]  This thing was going to turn. You know what's going to happen? They were going to give him
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:10.720]  a deal. That was going to happen. And he was going to spill the beans. And before he spilled
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:16.800]  the beans, they, they got rid of him. It's a conspiracy theory to believe this guy killed
[3:11:16.800 --> 3:11:23.960]  himself to me. But here's the deal. They should be banning the mainstream news for selling
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:29.720]  the conspiracy theory that he killed himself. We're supposed to swallow the crap that they
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:35.360]  keep shoving down our throat. Let me tell you something, Owen. That guy said I'm Hussein.
[3:11:35.360 --> 3:11:41.120]  He has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Kader. You don't believe me? You don't
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:48.400]  believe I'm a lion, little piece of low life crap named George W. Bush and Wolfish shits
[3:11:48.400 --> 3:11:56.680]  and penis Cheney and all the rest of them. No, you swallow that crap that if you don't,
[3:11:56.680 --> 3:12:06.400]  then you are guilty of eroding public acceptance of the BS they're shoving down our throat.
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:12.880]  This guy was wiped out. And I resent the people that call it a mafia. That's a hit on the
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:20.920]  Italians. This is bigger than a mafia. This is the Washington murderers. The Barack Obama's
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:25.800]  that slaughtered people. Yeah, I don't like that guy, Gaddafi. I want him out of there.
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:31.040]  I don't like that guy. His son. I don't care who you kill. I want him out of there. Bill
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:39.320]  Clinton, Bush, one murder after another. They wiped this guy out because all the dirt. Oh,
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:47.360]  the Duke of Windsor. Yeah, you got it. The mob took him out. The mob of the elite that
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:53.080]  steal all our money. There's not even a term for this. This is so big. Again, the victims
[3:12:53.080 --> 3:12:56.640]  knew they were going to kill him. The lawyers knew they were going to kill him. Gerald Salenti
[3:12:56.640 --> 3:12:58.920]  knew they were going to kill him. I'm going to play the clip of me and Joe Big saying
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:02.880]  they're going to kill everyone in the world knew clearly a stand down order. Who gave
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:06.320]  the stand down order? That's what we need to know. Here's Joe Big. You just played the
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:10.240]  clip. We should do this more often because we're all you just heard Gerald Salenti predicting
[3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:16.160]  they would kill him. Here's Joe Big and I last Friday hours before he that he died predicting
[3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:26.920]  it. Huge treasure trove of Jeffrey Epstein documents come out all the names of the people.
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:32.920]  It was just incredible. It was basically one or two degrees of separation from either the
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:38.560]  Clintons or directly the Democrat Party or huge donors of the Democrat Party or a big
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:44.200]  part of the media. I mean, every single one. So I mean, Joe, what do you make of all of
[3:13:44.200 --> 3:13:48.320]  this? I mean, we talked about, you know, you said Epstein probably going to shoot himself
[3:13:48.320 --> 3:13:51.920]  three times in the head and jail. Yeah. I mean, we've been talking about Epstein for
[3:13:51.920 --> 3:13:56.920]  years, connections with the Clintons and all that. But I never thought, you know, in a
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:01.440]  million years, we would see him be arrested and get to this point. But I think they've
[3:14:01.440 --> 3:14:05.840]  gotten so scared of him because of the information he has, what better way to control him than
[3:14:05.840 --> 3:14:09.720]  have him in that prison where they can sit there and scare the living crap out of him
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:13.720]  all the time. And it's only going to be a matter of time. Like I said, you know, jokeling
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:18.640]  that he shoots himself three times in the head, you know, while he's in prison, you
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:21.720]  know, they don't want that kind of information. Now that's that's going to bring down the
[3:14:21.720 --> 3:14:26.240]  whole that's brings down the Titanic. That's well iceberg right there. He needs to be out
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:30.520]  of prison. Like Trump needs to get him moved somewhere else. You need that bird singing.
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:34.520]  Well, that was a crazy thing too. How do you not have New York, you know, not where he's
[3:14:34.520 --> 3:14:39.920]  in jail at New York? How do you not have him so under surveillance that he could even
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:43.360]  be coming close to death like that? I mean, we still don't know what really happened.
[3:14:43.360 --> 3:14:47.680]  Well, I'm saying though, he's in New York, though. I mean, he's in there with the dirty
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:53.760]  cop who is obviously running probably Big Co Kang ring. I don't know. I think if Trump
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:57.320]  wants to really expose these people, that's what he needs to do. He needs to move him.
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:00.560]  He doesn't need to. We don't need to wake up one day in here that Epstein was killed.
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:03.600]  That can happen after he sings. He tried to kill himself, right?
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:06.560]  That was literally right. Oh, yeah, they wanted to keep him in his house.
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  So let me predicting Epstein would die on info wars. You just heard me and Joe Big predicting
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:15.280]  he would die less than 24 hours before he did it. And then what do they do, Gerald?
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:20.280]  They ban us off everything and they say we're fake news. I know.
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:24.360]  All right, I'm handing over the baton. I'm going to get out of the seat. I'm a loud mouth.
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:27.280]  I'm yelling. Gerald Salenty is the expert. He's got a lot to say, but Gerald, this is
[3:15:27.280 --> 3:15:31.640]  just, this is only, we have such an opportunity to awaken America right now. The window of

[3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:48.280]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com. And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night. We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[3:20:03.280 --> 3:20:31.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:31.280 --> 3:20:49.280]  Hey, great being here. Thanks for having me on. Oh, and you asked me a couple of questions. One of them was about Argentina. They had a called primary election, but what this is, it indicates who's going to win in October.
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:21:11.280]  And here's the Monday today, the Wall Street Journal before the story came out. You see all these underlines, by the way. This is what I do every day. I read newspapers, online stuff, and I underline the salient points of the story.
[3:21:11.280 --> 3:21:27.280]  You see, I had to read the whole thing. You just can't get it from the headlines, a little soundbites. And that's all people are doing now. They just have everything on their hand. And so everything's handheld and that's all you're getting is a handful rather than the entire story.
[3:21:27.280 --> 3:21:44.280]  So just a couple of things out here about a win for Mr. Fernandez is the guy that he was running against of more than five percentage points would raise fears among investors about the return to the power of Miss Kershner.
[3:21:44.280 --> 3:22:02.280]  She was running before she was running the show before him and her husband was running it before that during her eight year term that ended in 2015. Miss Kershner nationalized businesses implemented price controls and defaulted on Argentinian debt.
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:19.280]  As Mr. McCree grapples with anger over his in economic recession and double digit inflation. They all love this guy, McCree. He was one of the white shoe boys. That's right.
[3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:38.280]  He was brainwashed into the club. He was going to fix everything and boy did he fix it for the Argentinians. That's right. Borrowed $57 billion from the IMF, the International Mafia Federation.
[3:22:38.280 --> 3:22:58.280]  You know, the ones they call it austerity measures. We're going to raise your taxes. We're going to take your benefits. We're going to increase the every time it is until after you die because we made bad loans without our banks and we don't like making bad loans.
[3:22:58.280 --> 3:23:08.280]  So we're going to take the money from you and we got a little clown over here that's just one of the boys that's going to do what we tell them to do.
[3:23:08.280 --> 3:23:16.280]  That's what they did in Argentina as they did in Greece and other places. Shifting into the people.
[3:23:16.280 --> 3:23:30.280]  So what else do they have to say in this article in the Wall Street Journal? Double digit inflation. Economic turmoil would undercut his efforts to persuade voters to give them another four year term.
[3:23:30.280 --> 3:23:48.280]  So persuade voters so he could shaft them for another four years. Mr. McCree was elected in 2015 with 51% of the vote on promises to slash inflation and jumpstart economic growth.
[3:23:48.280 --> 3:24:05.280]  In June, you know what their inflation rate was? 56%. He did a great job. He's terrific. One of the white shoe boys. So here's the vote.
[3:24:05.280 --> 3:24:25.280]  McCree got 47%. Excuse me. He was defeated by Fernandez who got 47%. He got the grand total of 32%. They said 5% would really change the direction of this.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:31.280]  So there you go. That's what's going on in Argentina.
[3:24:31.280 --> 3:24:43.280]  The importance of this is bigger, of course, than what's going on in Argentina with their, I think it's about a 23% unemployment rate.
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:54.280]  Owen mentioned how the peso took a big hit. The Argentinian pesos down over 50% already this year.
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:25:08.280]  And it's going on all over the world. Not at one time, but at different levels all over.
[3:25:08.280 --> 3:25:20.280]  Risk of recession grows for Asian commercial hub. Of course, they're talking now a lot about what's going on in Hong Kong, what's throughout the area.
[3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:36.280]  Several researchers are expecting quarter on quarter contraction, the second such decline in a row, and a technical definition of recession for Hong Kong.
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:45.280]  It's not only there you're looking at slowdowns in Indonesia, India. You saw what they did in India. You know one of my sayings.
[3:25:45.280 --> 3:25:52.280]  When all else fails, they take you to war. The Indian equity markets are plummeting.
[3:25:52.280 --> 3:26:01.280]  They had an election recently, Modi, the prime minister got reelected. The economy's going south.
[3:26:01.280 --> 3:26:22.280]  So now they just repealed the law that they did in 1947, giving Kashmir the right to have their own government. That's gone now.
[3:26:22.280 --> 3:26:38.280]  So it's one place after another where we're seeing the loss of rights and a buildup to war. You name the country and you can see the problems.
[3:26:38.280 --> 3:26:53.280]  Khan steps up Kashmir rhetoric with India. Khan, of course, is the prime minister of Pakistan. He said about what India did, amounted to an impending genocide,
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:27:10.280]  attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. He questioned if, quote, will the world watch and appease as they did hitlers at Munich.
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:24.280]  He continued, it will lead to suppression of Muslims in India and eventually lead to the targeting of Pakistan.
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:31.280]  These are two nuclear enemies.
[3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:48.280]  This is from the Financial Times. The heavily militarized line of division between the two nuclear arms states in Kashmir is considered one of the most dangerous fault lines in the world.
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:28:03.280]  So, hardly anything's coming out of Kashmir now. India's imposed strict limits on social media, anything coming out of them. When all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:28:03.280 --> 3:28:06.280]  And that's what we're concerned about.
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:18.280]  I said this about two months ago. First person I mentioned it on the show, I believe, was David Knight. We are entering into the greatest depression.
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:29.280]  I'll go through more than numbers when we come back. They're real and they're not so good. People already know there's a depression.
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:41.280]  They feel it in their bones and they feel it in their pocket. It's going to hurt, it's going to be deep, and it's going to be long.
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:29:00.280]  We'll tell you what to do and how to prepare. And we come back.

[3:34:45.280 --> 3:35:07.280]  So do what you can. Again, I began this by talking about how the mainstream media, the prostitutes, use the language and call anybody that questions how this guy Epstein was wiped out a conspiracy conspiracy theorist believer.
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:17.280]  To me, it's a conspiracy theory to believe this guy hung himself. So anybody is saving for yourself. I don't want to hear it.
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:37.280]  This came down from the top, as I see it. And again, we played the clip. We did it on our trends in the news broadcast on July 29. Two weeks before the hang it.
[3:35:37.280 --> 3:35:57.280]  So do what you can to support InfoWars and keep the truth alive. They should be banning the New York Times in a Wall Street Journal and ABC NBC CBS, the selling these conspiracy theories that he hung himself.
[3:35:57.280 --> 3:36:10.280]  So I was talking before about the greatest depression. This is a time to prepare so you can prevail and prosper.
[3:36:10.280 --> 3:36:19.280]  Now, I've been on Alex Jones show a long time in the major media. The decades.
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:29.280]  I'm not bragging, but if you go to our trendsresearch.com site and hit the forecast list, you'll see the things I forecast.
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:40.280]  And I made my name back in 1987 as a trend forecaster, forecasting the 1987 stock market crash, the first in the world to do it.
[3:36:40.280 --> 3:36:54.280]  And the stock market stock market.com bus. And clean foods. Coin that term. New York Times. It's a big story on it. Bottled water trend back in the 80s.
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:37:07.280]  Panic of our weight. I took out the domain name in 2007. One after another. The gold bull run. The first one I did in the 2000s.
[3:37:07.280 --> 3:37:17.280]  It was in the 300 ring. On June 6 of this year, we sent a trend alert out to all our subscribers of the trends journal.
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:25.280]  Of course, you could subscribe to by going to trendsjournal.com. The only magazine in the world where you will read history before it happens.
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:32.280]  You tune into the major media. You get what happened. You get.
[3:37:32.280 --> 3:37:38.280]  Yesterday's news today. The trends journal. We get tomorrow's news today.
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:44.280]  And of course, there's a discount request page there as well. If you can't afford the full price, only 129.
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:54.280]  But anyway, we sent out a trend alert. And again, I've been on Alex's show and many shows. I've been negative on gold.
[3:37:54.280 --> 3:38:03.280]  For over five years. I call the bottom of gold was only $50 off.
[3:38:03.280 --> 3:38:09.280]  I said gold had a break over the 1450 mark to gain strength.
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:21.280]  So on June 6 when gold was selling at $1,332 an ounce and as we speak, it's about $1,500.
[3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:27.280]  And $10 an ounce. I said the gold bull run has begun.
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:34.280]  Because gold solidified over 1,325. That was the first point I was looking for.
[3:38:34.280 --> 3:38:41.280]  Point number two is 1,385. Went right by that one quick.
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:48.280]  And then the next one was 1,450. I've been saying this now for the better part.
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:55.280]  For six years. And now it's well over the 1,450 mark.
[3:38:55.280 --> 3:39:01.280]  I see a very small downside risk of gold. I do not give financial advice. I am a trend forecaster.
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:07.280]  I don't tell you what to do with your money. I'm not an investment strategist.
[3:39:07.280 --> 3:39:12.280]  I'm not licensed to be one. I don't want to be one. I'm a trend forecaster.
[3:39:12.280 --> 3:39:23.280]  The downside risk of gold for me right now is I see it 1,430. Maybe 1,400.
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:29.280]  That's a very small downside risk in the futures markets.
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:34.280]  The upside I believe is going to crash through 2000.
[3:39:34.280 --> 3:39:38.280]  And now I'm going to start telling you why more and more.
[3:39:38.280 --> 3:39:47.280]  And again, but before I do, I'm telling you to consider becoming very serious about planning for the future.
[3:39:47.280 --> 3:39:52.280]  Remember, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[3:39:52.280 --> 3:39:59.280]  And my other saying is when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:09.280]  You're going to see violence, demonstrations, robberies, murder in the first degree.
[3:40:09.280 --> 3:40:22.280]  People are going to be out of their minds, do anything they want to get what they want, because they have nothing to lose.
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:26.280]  When people have nothing to lose, they lose it.
[3:40:26.280 --> 3:40:34.280]  So consider buying up enough provisions.
[3:40:34.280 --> 3:40:43.280]  Consider guns, gold, and a getaway plan of things to get really ugly.
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:55.280]  One of the first sectors that's going to lose their jobs is the real estate sector, the hospitality sector.
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:01.280]  That's where you're going to start seeing the first hits.
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:08.280]  It doesn't mean everything's going down. A lot is going to go up.
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:16.280]  And those are the opportunities you're going to want to see. The game changes. That's all.
[3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:25.280]  If you're stuck in what you have and where you were, you're not going to be ready to move forward when the big change comes.
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:33.280]  And when I talk about the products, of course, I promote them because I believe in them.
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:42:02.280]  Number one, the ones that I've had that Alex Jones has on his info wars stores. And number two, the first thing to consider when the greatest depression hits is you to be in the best shape you can physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[3:42:02.280 --> 3:42:08.280]  I'm not talking religiously. Everybody has their own trip.
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:17.280]  But being the best person you could be. And I want to make this clear. I'm not the same guy was when you grow up. Everybody has their crap that you do.
[3:42:17.280 --> 3:42:20.280]  You try to learn and be better.
[3:42:20.280 --> 3:42:30.280]  So this is really a time to consider doing the best you can to be in the best shape you can.
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:41.280]  Games over. Fights on. The people are going to be fighting for their life when the greatest depression hits.
[3:42:41.280 --> 3:42:49.280]  And if you don't believe me, it's going to hit. I have some evidence here that's going to make it really clear.
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:53.280]  When we come back, we talk more about it.
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:43:03.280]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[3:43:03.280 --> 3:43:24.280]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:33.280]  It's almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression. The InfoWars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[3:43:33.280 --> 3:43:38.280]  To make real the actions of independent free speech. To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:45.280]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:48.280]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:53.280]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw. Even it is what you just saw.
[3:43:53.280 --> 3:44:00.280]  I got a plug for the Patriot points. I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:07.280]  I buy so much in the store because I don't want to give that money to Walmart. I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[3:44:07.280 --> 3:44:12.280]  So I'd rather give that money to you and then get in quality product. The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[3:44:12.280 --> 3:44:18.280]  The X2 has really done a lot for me. I've lost weight. My brain works a whole lot better. My kid, they use the toothpaste.
[3:44:18.280 --> 3:44:24.280]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat.
[3:44:24.280 --> 3:44:28.280]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you. I want high quality stuff in there. I want a good price.
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:32.280]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:38.280]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off. And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[3:44:38.280 --> 3:44:43.280]  Thank you so much for the plugs. But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[3:44:43.280 --> 3:44:49.280]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off and then you do something like that.
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:54.280]  We have Patriot points, we lose money, but that's okay. Thanks for the support.
[3:44:54.280 --> 3:45:00.280]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future,
[3:45:00.280 --> 3:45:07.280]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[3:45:07.280 --> 3:45:16.280]  And today the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago. And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president
[3:45:16.280 --> 3:45:22.280]  and what he's doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers. That's beautiful.
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:25.280]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[3:45:25.280 --> 3:45:31.280]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down,
[3:45:31.280 --> 3:45:39.280]  we're never going to give up. And all you've done is awaken the human spirit. The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:45.280]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[3:45:45.280 --> 3:46:01.280]  We are the resistance. We are 1776 worldwide.
[3:46:16.280 --> 3:46:21.280]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the site and you can find all the great products there and try them for yourself.
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:27.280]  And again, sign up for auto-ship and an additional 10% off. It is such a revolutionary act to keep this broadcast on air.
[3:46:27.280 --> 3:46:33.280]  It is such a revolutionary act every time you put a bumper sticker on your car or paintinfowars.com on the side of your barn.
[3:46:33.280 --> 3:46:41.280]  Every time you stand up to leftist police, every time you tell the truth, every time you keep the symbol of free speech and pro-human values alive,
[3:46:41.280 --> 3:46:47.280]  the enemy comes one step closer to their system falling. We have pushed them into overreaching and showing their hand.
[3:46:47.280 --> 3:46:52.280]  And now we've got a fighting chance if we all take action of defeating the globalist. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[3:46:52.280 --> 3:47:16.280]  But please take advantage of the sale.
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:31.280]  Hey, great being here, great being here on the Alex Jones show. I want to follow up on the questions.
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:34.280]  You know, they don't want to ask me. I wrote them down over here.
[3:47:34.280 --> 3:47:41.280]  I talked about Guatemala, no more deal to work with Trump with the new president being elected.
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:50.280]  I'm talking about the Greatest Depression. The system of trend forecasting is called global-nomic, meaning all things are connected.
[3:47:50.280 --> 3:47:56.280]  Or as Chief Seattle is alleged to have said, all things are connected like the blood which unites us all.
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:48:01.280]  So going back to the immigration problem, this is global.
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:07.280]  As the Greatest Depression hits, you haven't seen anything.
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:11.280]  Do you know why they don't want to do the Trump deal with Guatemala?
[3:48:11.280 --> 3:48:17.280]  They want to get the people out of there because they have their own problems.
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:23.280]  They don't have enough jobs. They can't feed them. They can't house them.
[3:48:23.280 --> 3:48:26.280]  They want them out.
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:41.280]  Human waves out of Africa, out of South America, out of poor places in Asia, it's not going to stop.
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:47.280]  The first shape the global economy gets into, more human waves.
[3:48:47.280 --> 3:48:57.280]  Owen also mentioned that Hillary Clinton was doing a gig pro-immigration.
[3:48:57.280 --> 3:49:02.280]  I want to have a referendum on each state ballot.
[3:49:02.280 --> 3:49:04.280]  Very simple.
[3:49:04.280 --> 3:49:15.280]  And we, the people, will decide whether or not to allow illegal immigrants to come into the nation.
[3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:18.280]  And it's a very simple ballot.
[3:49:18.280 --> 3:49:31.280]  Yes, I would like more illegal and non-legal, illegal and legal immigrants to come into America.
[3:49:31.280 --> 3:49:48.280]  I am willing to pay X amount of dollars in taxes to feed them, to house them, to clothe them,
[3:49:48.280 --> 3:49:53.280]  educate them, and for medical benefits.
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:55.280]  Very simple.
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:50:07.280]  Or no, I do not want any more immigrants, illegal or legal.
[3:50:07.280 --> 3:50:15.280]  And I'm willing to pay X amount of dollars to protect our borders.
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:18.280]  And by the way, I'm not in favor of a wall.
[3:50:18.280 --> 3:50:21.280]  This is the 21st century. You don't need a wall.
[3:50:21.280 --> 3:50:29.280]  I want to bring home all the troops from the over 800 bases we have in some, what?
[3:50:29.280 --> 3:50:37.280]  How many countries, 90 countries around the world, and have them protect the borders?
[3:50:37.280 --> 3:50:42.280]  And with the new technology that we have, it could be done in a much more effective,
[3:50:42.280 --> 3:50:46.280]  without destroying so much of the economy or wasting so much money.
[3:50:46.280 --> 3:50:49.280]  So it's a very simple referendum.
[3:50:49.280 --> 3:50:50.280]  Yes or no?
[3:50:50.280 --> 3:50:54.280]  Let we the people decide.
[3:50:54.280 --> 3:51:02.280]  But they won't do that because you got the mafia running the group, the Washington gang.
[3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:07.280]  Now, going back to the economy and talking about what's going to happen with the Greatest Depression,
[3:51:07.280 --> 3:51:10.280]  the jobs it'll be lost.
[3:51:10.280 --> 3:51:15.280]  Again, save your money. Start saving it now.
[3:51:15.280 --> 3:51:17.280]  Bottled water?
[3:51:17.280 --> 3:51:23.280]  You buy one of the water filters that you have over there that you get from info stores.
[3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:27.280]  You get a nice stainless steel container.
[3:51:27.280 --> 3:51:30.280]  So when you're traveling, you're in the car, you fill it up.
[3:51:30.280 --> 3:51:33.280]  That's what I do. I don't drink bottled water.
[3:51:33.280 --> 3:51:36.280]  It's the same crap you're getting mostly everywhere else.
[3:51:36.280 --> 3:51:39.280]  What do you think? This is clean stuff?
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:49.280]  And I'm a believer that the water and plastic bottles as it heats up in your car, sends out more and more chemicals than the plastic.
[3:51:49.280 --> 3:51:52.280]  And it's not good for your health.
[3:51:52.280 --> 3:51:56.280]  So start thinking in those terms.
[3:51:56.280 --> 3:51:58.280]  It's summertime.
[3:51:58.280 --> 3:52:01.280]  The living is easy.
[3:52:01.280 --> 3:52:03.280]  Start going to the farmers markets.
[3:52:03.280 --> 3:52:06.280]  Buying the best that you could get.
[3:52:06.280 --> 3:52:11.280]  Remember to survive and thrive in the Greatest Depression.
[3:52:11.280 --> 3:52:20.280]  Number one, you're going to have to be in the best health you can possibly be in physically, emotionally and spiritually.
[3:52:20.280 --> 3:52:24.280]  So those are some things to consider.
[3:52:24.280 --> 3:52:34.280]  And I want to say when you look at the data talking before about gold,
[3:52:34.280 --> 3:52:47.280]  investors way specter of subzero rates is more than $15 trillion in government debt around the world with negative yields.
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:57.280]  That means essentially that savers are holding those bonds which are paying the government to store their money.
[3:52:57.280 --> 3:53:00.280]  You can't make this crap up.
[3:53:00.280 --> 3:53:08.280]  Germany, Netherlands, France.
[3:53:08.280 --> 3:53:14.280]  Countries have negative bond yields. Japan.
[3:53:14.280 --> 3:53:24.280]  You buy a 10 year or 30 year German bond and you get back less than what you're boarded for when you cash it in after it matures.
[3:53:24.280 --> 3:53:30.280]  And now you have a 30 day bond that's paying you a higher rate.
[3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:39.280]  That's called an inversion, a yield inversion, inverted yield curve.
[3:53:39.280 --> 3:53:52.280]  Inverted yield curves preceded every recession in the last 50 years.
[3:53:52.280 --> 3:53:58.280]  This is not going to be a recession.
[3:53:58.280 --> 3:54:01.280]  It's going to be a depression.
[3:54:01.280 --> 3:54:05.280]  The negative yields, they can't lower them anymore.
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:10.280]  The interest rates, the Federal Reserve could only lower interest rates.
[3:54:10.280 --> 3:54:26.280]  And now everyone out there that the business media is covering are saying what I've been saying now, the eight months that they're going to bring yields back down to near zero.
[3:54:26.280 --> 3:54:35.280]  And by the way, this is hurting the banks big time because they can't make money loaning money out with these kind of rates.
[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:37.280]  They don't have a lot of room to go down.
[3:54:37.280 --> 3:54:45.280]  The last time they did it, the last recession, they lowered interest rates five percentage points.
[3:54:45.280 --> 3:54:49.280]  Now you got about two left.
[3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:51.280]  And it's global.
[3:54:51.280 --> 3:54:57.280]  In Europe, they got negative interest rates.
[3:54:57.280 --> 3:55:03.280]  Yeah, one after another.
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:08.280]  British economy shrinks the first time in seven years.
[3:55:08.280 --> 3:55:13.280]  UK pound, it's multi-year lows.
[3:55:13.280 --> 3:55:24.280]  Italian banks still hold more than double the proportion of bad loans of the whole Eurozone.
[3:55:24.280 --> 3:55:27.280]  Global banks, you ready for this?
[3:55:27.280 --> 3:55:42.280]  This today's news, Financial Times cuts 30,000 jobs as investment climate darkens.
[3:55:42.280 --> 3:55:43.280]  Why?
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:44.280]  That's racist.
[3:55:44.280 --> 3:55:45.280]  They say darkens.
[3:55:45.280 --> 3:55:46.280]  Why?
[3:55:46.280 --> 3:55:48.280]  I think they should do something about that.
[3:55:48.280 --> 3:55:50.280]  Can't call it blacklist anymore.
[3:55:50.280 --> 3:55:52.280]  You can't get blacklisted.
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:56.280]  This garbage is identity politics.
[3:55:56.280 --> 3:56:01.280]  Can't say amen anymore without saying amen.
[3:56:01.280 --> 3:56:05.280]  Almost 30,000 layoffs have been announced since April.
[3:56:05.280 --> 3:56:16.280]  Since April at banks, including HSBC, Barclays, Society General, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and others.
[3:56:16.280 --> 3:56:19.280]  European bank woes deep in.
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:25.280]  All right, I'm staying on the banks because if the banks go down, it's a bust.
[3:56:25.280 --> 3:56:31.280]  And David Knight is very much on top of what's going on with Deutsche Bank.
[3:56:31.280 --> 3:56:33.280]  And I said, bad, this isn't.
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:37.280]  I don't see them being bringing down the crash, but it's certainly part of it.
[3:56:37.280 --> 3:56:39.280]  But I may be wrong on that.
[3:56:39.280 --> 3:56:46.280]  And he may be correct on that because this thing's coming down.
[3:56:46.280 --> 3:56:51.280]  Rise and jobless fuels rate cut talk.
[3:56:51.280 --> 3:56:54.280]  Canada's unemployment rate rose in July.
[3:56:54.280 --> 3:56:56.280]  Okay.
[3:56:56.280 --> 3:56:58.280]  Philippines cut rates last week.
[3:56:58.280 --> 3:57:00.280]  Thailand cut rates last week.
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:05.280]  India cut rates last week.
[3:57:05.280 --> 3:57:12.280]  New Zealand cut rates 50 basis points last week.
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:15.280]  One after another.
[3:57:15.280 --> 3:57:17.280]  The thing is coming down.
[3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:20.280]  They're going to do everything they can.
[3:57:20.280 --> 3:57:26.280]  Everything they can to keep juicing the markets up with cheap money.
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:31.280]  But there's not a lot left and not a lot left to do.
[3:57:31.280 --> 3:57:37.280]  So we're suggesting you prepare, prevail and prosper.
[3:57:37.280 --> 3:57:41.280]  Get ready for the greatest depression.
[3:57:41.280 --> 3:57:51.280]  It's closer than you think.
[3:58:12.280 --> 3:58:15.280]  So now more than you've ever done for yourself, for me, for everybody.
[3:58:15.280 --> 3:58:18.280]  Spread the word about this broadcast on your local station, radio, TV.
[3:58:18.280 --> 3:58:20.280]  Tell folks about infoworks.com.
[3:58:20.280 --> 3:58:22.280]  But that said, I want to fight hard.
[3:58:22.280 --> 3:58:25.280]  And I need you to buy the products at infoworksstore.com.
[3:58:25.280 --> 3:58:29.280]  Huge sale, the one-year anniversary, banning sale, the banniversary sale.

[3:58:32.280 --> 3:58:35.280]  Get all the great products you need and know you are funding,
[3:58:35.280 --> 3:58:37.280]  not just the Second American Revolution,
[3:58:37.280 --> 3:58:40.280]  but a pro-human future against the devil-worshipping,
[3:58:40.280 --> 3:58:45.280]  against the communist and their off-world controllers.
[3:58:45.280 --> 3:58:50.280]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech
[3:58:50.280 --> 3:58:53.280]  in the western world's history.
[3:58:53.280 --> 3:58:57.280]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[3:58:57.280 --> 3:59:06.280]  Not to say the name Alex Jones, or infoworks.com.
[3:59:06.280 --> 3:59:08.280]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[3:59:08.280 --> 3:59:10.280]  This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[3:59:10.280 --> 3:59:14.280]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now.
[3:59:14.280 --> 3:59:16.280]  You can take on Big Tech.
[3:59:16.280 --> 3:59:21.280]  They saw infoworks as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human,
[3:59:21.280 --> 3:59:25.280]  pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[3:59:25.280 --> 3:59:28.280]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones,
[3:59:28.280 --> 3:59:31.280]  then when people say, OK, take him off the air,
[3:59:31.280 --> 3:59:33.280]  everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[3:59:33.280 --> 3:59:37.280]  The way to fight back is to support infoworks now more than ever
[3:59:37.280 --> 3:59:40.280]  and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[3:59:40.280 --> 3:59:42.280]  Understand that they believe they can take us down.
[3:59:42.280 --> 4:00:11.280]  They'll take everybody else down.
