[00:00.000 --> 00:11.240]  This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication, so you've got a thing on
[00:11.240 --> 00:15.920]  the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero, and that's going to be based on the number
[00:15.920 --> 00:22.760]  of people, the services, each person's using on average, the energy on average for each
[00:22.760 --> 00:27.960]  service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:27.960 --> 00:33.720]  So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:33.720 --> 00:37.720]  Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:37.720 --> 00:42.440]  That's back from a high school algebra, but let's take a look.
[00:42.440 --> 00:44.480]  First we've got population.
[00:44.480 --> 00:49.480]  The world today has 6.8 billion people, that's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:49.480 --> 00:56.000]  Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services,
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.640]  we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:59.640 --> 01:06.840]  Many believed that Bill Gates somehow misspoke when he attributed successful depopulation
[01:06.840 --> 01:11.200]  to the vaccines, but it's now evident that he didn't.
[01:11.200 --> 01:19.120]  He was being very clear about the intentions of the globalist agenda, kill 99.99 percent
[01:19.120 --> 01:21.400]  of all humans.
[01:21.400 --> 01:26.760]  According to these psychopaths, this is how we will save the planet, and they have convinced
[01:26.760 --> 01:32.720]  an overwhelming amount of the world's population into accepting their agenda and pushing for
[01:32.720 --> 01:33.720]  it.
[01:33.720 --> 01:38.440]  People who believe that humans need to be aborted, and believe the human race needs to
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.120]  be called into a small, compliant herd.
[01:42.120 --> 01:47.280]  People that are okay with billions of people starving, so long as the screens on their
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.320]  devices tell them it's the right thing to do.
[01:51.320 --> 01:54.680]  But not everyone has gone insane.
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.920]  Some still have a survival instinct.
[01:57.920 --> 02:03.200]  When the Dutch government voted in a scheme that will force farmers to cut their livestock
[02:03.200 --> 02:09.760]  down to unsustainable levels, thereby forcing them out of work and shutting down the second
[02:09.760 --> 02:17.840]  biggest food exporter in the world, the farmers did the right thing and said no, and protests
[02:17.840 --> 02:21.800]  have broken out all throughout the Netherlands.
[02:21.800 --> 02:27.600]  Shutting down the world's second biggest food exporter is all part of the anti-human zero
[02:27.600 --> 02:34.600]  emissions plan, and so the Dutch farmers aren't just protesting losing their jobs, they're
[02:34.600 --> 02:39.720]  protesting the mass murder of the world's population.
[02:39.720 --> 02:45.200]  Just like the Canadian truckers and farmers did last winter, and just like the Canadian
[02:45.200 --> 02:51.920]  police sided with the tyrants, the Dutch cops are doing the same, police drawing their
[02:51.920 --> 03:06.000]  sidearms on peaceful protesters, and opening fire on them.
[03:06.000 --> 03:24.040]  Then undercover agents and provoking violence to shut down peaceful gatherings.
[03:24.040 --> 03:28.320]  Because the globalists are not taking no for an answer.
[03:28.320 --> 03:35.040]  And while you may back the blue, chances are that they won't back you when it comes to
[03:35.040 --> 03:41.880]  the globalist agenda, which has now enlisted A-list celebrities to convince us all to eat
[03:41.880 --> 03:42.880]  bugs.
[03:42.880 --> 03:48.360]  I'm Nicole Kidman, and I am going to eat a four-cost meal of bugs.
[03:48.360 --> 03:54.920]  They're trying to persuade us into dying peacefully, like good, obedient slaves.
[03:54.920 --> 04:01.440]  But soon the food will start to run out, and worse, more signs of kinetic world war on
[04:01.440 --> 04:08.560]  the horizon as Japan's longest standing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is assassinated.
[04:08.560 --> 04:14.640]  And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joins President Putin in threatening nuclear
[04:14.640 --> 04:19.880]  annihilation if the United States continues their provocations.
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.520]  Which is exactly what the Extinction Rebellion wants.
[04:23.520 --> 04:26.560]  And it's what the Biden administration wants.
[04:26.560 --> 04:29.160]  It's what everyone in charge wants.
[04:29.160 --> 04:33.840]  The only way out of this is a worldwide people's revolution.
[04:33.840 --> 04:39.440]  The Dutch farmers have begun, and they have been joined by people from other nations.
[04:39.440 --> 04:42.560]  The revolution will not be televised.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.480]  And if you want to stand up against evil, then now is the time.
[04:47.480 --> 04:50.600]  While you are still alive.
[04:50.600 --> 04:54.400]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:54.400 --> 05:01.400]  Sunday Live, stay with us, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[05:01.400 --> 05:10.200]  The July 4, 2022 Super Sale is live and only running for one week exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[05:10.200 --> 05:14.480]  Double Patriot points, and 40 to 75% off.

[05:20.600 --> 05:23.280]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year.
[05:23.280 --> 05:26.160]  Some of these products were selling at below cost, but you've got to move them out of the
[05:26.160 --> 05:29.120]  warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.360]  So please take action and declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip
[05:33.360 --> 05:39.280]  of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[05:39.280 --> 05:43.560]  I want to thank you all this July 4 for your continued fight for America, and I would encourage
[05:43.560 --> 05:47.120]  you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[05:47.120 --> 05:54.880]  InfowarsStore.com and celebrate July 4, 1776, Part 2 against the New World Order, because
[05:54.880 --> 05:59.880]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[05:59.880 --> 06:16.880]  Sunday, July 10, 2022, Greg Rees set us here, Infowars, Tomorrow's News.
[06:16.880 --> 06:41.140]  The
[06:41.140 --> 07:00.100]  Sri Lanka, India, the Netherlands, Albania, the U.S., the U.K., South Africa, and countries
[07:00.100 --> 07:05.660]  in Latin America, over a hundred nations having massive riots, government buildings being
[07:05.660 --> 07:12.740]  stormed. Sunday live, the global collapse that we have predicted this year is the organized
[07:12.740 --> 07:18.220]  great reset being carried out by design. We're going to lay out what comes next.
[07:18.220 --> 07:25.420]  Now, a lot of people, including a lot of nationalists and populists and conservatives, are celebrating
[07:25.420 --> 07:32.420]  the riots and takeover of government buildings around the world. And they're saying, look,
[07:32.420 --> 07:38.540]  the people are awake, they're angry, they're going after these corrupt systems, they know
[07:38.540 --> 07:44.540]  what's going on. And this is an equation. This is political math, basically, is what
[07:44.540 --> 07:49.260]  it boils down to. Yes, the public's angry because they've been under two and a half
[07:49.260 --> 07:52.940]  years in many areas of the world of lockdown that destroyed the economy and the supply
[07:52.940 --> 07:58.460]  chain. And yes, many of these governments have been clients of the globalist, and so
[07:58.460 --> 08:04.820]  they are bad people. But if you go back to the IMF and World Bank documents that Greg
[08:04.820 --> 08:14.860]  Pallas got in 2002 that we covered at Nausium, they said that in the next 20 years they would
[08:14.860 --> 08:22.180]  implement the same formulas they had used in third world countries to collapse them
[08:22.180 --> 08:29.780]  by design in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. And so
[08:29.780 --> 08:35.580]  people ask why I've been harping on the coming collapse. Well, that's because the globalists
[08:35.580 --> 08:41.500]  have said they would do it, not just in those documents, but in thousands of other statements
[08:41.500 --> 08:46.420]  and documents we've covered here. So it wasn't like I was predicting this, I knew they were
[08:46.420 --> 08:52.060]  going to try to do it, and so we were trying to expose them and stop them from getting
[08:52.060 --> 08:57.340]  to this point. We weren't just trying to predict it to be proven right, we were trying to stop
[08:57.340 --> 09:05.100]  it. So are they bad to storm government buildings in Sri Lanka? No. Are they bad to storm government
[09:05.100 --> 09:11.500]  buildings in India? No. Are they bad to surround police stations in the airports in the Netherlands
[09:11.500 --> 09:18.500]  and block all the major roads in the country? No. Are they wrong in Albania? Do the same
[09:18.500 --> 09:26.780]  thing? No. But the corporate media is spinning it like they're just mad at their governments
[09:26.780 --> 09:36.620]  and this is going to cause a worldwide collapse. No, the lockdowns of the last 30 months is
[09:36.620 --> 09:44.340]  what was on record to destroy the supply chain and destroy food supplies and energy supplies
[09:44.340 --> 09:51.100]  and then mathematically they know that when you're spending more than 50% on food and energy,
[09:51.100 --> 09:58.180]  you will have a violent revolution. It's guaranteed black people act the same, brown people act
[09:58.180 --> 10:07.700]  the same, white people act the same. At the end of the day, folks, we're the same. And
[10:07.700 --> 10:11.980]  that's why Klaus Schwab talks about an angrier world and how we're going through a transition
[10:11.980 --> 10:21.740]  and that's why Bill Gates and Joe Biden and Bill Clinton and Angela Merkel and McCron
[10:21.740 --> 10:28.140]  and Johnson and all of them say, Trudeau, all of them say we're cutting off the energy
[10:28.140 --> 10:34.660]  and the food to bring in the new system, but there is no new system to even bring in. So
[10:34.660 --> 10:43.660]  I've been sitting here looking at my watch, hoping we could stop it, knowing it was coming,
[10:43.660 --> 10:47.620]  not knowing exactly when, but these are the big central banks, these are the people who
[10:47.620 --> 10:52.460]  took over the world by fiat currency, these are the folks that run the Eugenics systems
[10:52.460 --> 10:56.580]  and the depopulation operations and the drag queen pedophile time and the devalued currencies,
[10:56.580 --> 11:04.260]  the open borders and the whole thing. And so we've been sitting here battling their
[11:04.260 --> 11:10.500]  agenda warning people they'll ban your cows, which holds up and is the only profit in most
[11:10.500 --> 11:14.780]  farms in the world. And now they're banning those in Europe. And now it's coming here.
[11:14.780 --> 11:18.960]  Bill Gates doesn't get up and say we're going to ban beef, we're going to make you eat bugs
[11:18.960 --> 11:24.020]  because he's pulling out of his rear end. They mean that. And folks are going to figure
[11:24.020 --> 11:30.380]  that out that we're not up here imagining fantastical stuff. And then it just comes
[11:30.380 --> 11:36.020]  true. Like a very popular thing I see everywhere is Alex Jones gives them ideas. Boy, I wish
[11:36.020 --> 11:43.660]  that was the case. No, I am reading their battle plan for a controlled worldwide economic
[11:43.660 --> 11:48.740]  demolition that will starve the third world to death. Who survives will flood us bring
[11:48.740 --> 11:54.580]  us down. Mass war famine collapse and then out of it a worldwide authoritarian government
[11:54.580 --> 12:00.380]  to stabilize the planet with a planetary currency, carbon taxes, universal credit score built
[12:00.380 --> 12:06.020]  in the back of the vaccine passport. And all of it's been announced and all of it's here.
[12:06.020 --> 12:12.060]  So my job is about to get a lot easier. I'm not here telling you what I'm trying to stop
[12:12.060 --> 12:23.540]  anymore. Baby, baby, baby, we're in it now. The only question is, how far do you want
[12:23.540 --> 12:31.740]  this to go? How bad do you want it to get until you identify the new world order? Let
[12:31.740 --> 12:39.860]  me give you the good news. In Australia, in New Zealand, in Albania, in Sri Lanka, and
[12:39.860 --> 12:49.340]  in the Netherlands, particularly in the UK. You go read the signs. We've translated them.
[12:49.340 --> 12:58.140]  In the Dutch, in the German, in the French, in the Sri Lankan, all of it. They are saying
[12:58.140 --> 13:03.260]  we want the central banks. We want Klaus Schwab. We want Bill Gates. We don't want our governments
[13:03.260 --> 13:07.380]  to be run by them. We know you cut the fuel off. We know you cut the food off. We know
[13:07.380 --> 13:16.380]  you did the lockdowns to do this. We're going to kill you. That's per se. So let me give
[13:16.380 --> 13:20.140]  the new world order a little announcement here. Because I don't just tell the general
[13:20.140 --> 13:24.500]  public what's coming next. I tell the enemy, and they know it's true. Because I don't say
[13:24.500 --> 13:30.980]  something unless I believe it. You screwed up big time, you doubled down, and now you're
[13:30.980 --> 13:36.660]  in deep trouble. Maybe not this year, maybe not five years, but in the end, you will all
[13:36.660 --> 13:40.620]  be in prison for the rest of your lives if you're lucky when this is all over. You're
[13:40.620 --> 13:44.860]  not going to have your robot takeover. Your rate reset is going to fail. Your agenda 2030
[13:44.860 --> 13:50.300]  is not going to work. People know you're doing it, and they know who you are. And there's
[13:50.300 --> 13:54.340]  seven and a half billion of us. And we know when you release the next bio weapon that's
[13:54.340 --> 13:59.180]  10 times more deadly that you did it. And there won't be anywhere on earth that's safe
[13:59.180 --> 14:07.580]  for you and your Georgia guide stones. So I'm here to thank God for this. As bad as
[14:07.580 --> 14:10.820]  things are, at least we're in a fighting stance, at least we know what's going on. Warmer
[14:10.820 --> 14:19.660]  people know and it's a chain reaction. We're winning. But I want to thank God number one.
[14:19.660 --> 14:25.740]  I want to thank the crew and the audience of activists and my family and those that have
[14:25.740 --> 14:29.460]  supported us. And I want to make this announcement not as a boast or an attack because the enemy
[14:29.460 --> 14:33.740]  knows it's true. But I want to say this, this operation blew the New World Order down the
[14:33.740 --> 14:39.060]  road. It's like force 10 from Navarone. They plant the bombs on the dam, they explode, and
[14:39.060 --> 14:45.940]  they go, it failed. And the demolition expert goes, give it a couple minutes. Give it a
[14:45.940 --> 14:51.380]  couple minutes. You think you blew us? You think you took down our civilization? You
[14:51.380 --> 14:57.340]  just destroyed yourselves. You psycho demons led around by your nose by Satan, thinking
[14:57.340 --> 15:04.460]  you were about to inherit the earth and pull this off. 80% of my mission is now complete.
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.300]  I will complete the rest of the 20%. And if I'm still around after that, that's all gravy.
[15:09.300 --> 15:12.860]  But it's all in God's hands. I just want to complete the mission. And I want the crew
[15:12.860 --> 15:17.940]  to understand that. But I have done the numbers on the U.S. economy, the world economy. And
[15:17.940 --> 15:23.420]  I will tell you, barring a miracle, we won't be on the air in one year. These Democrat
[15:23.420 --> 15:27.340]  lawsuits don't matter. None of this stuff matters. Folks, let me explain something.
[15:27.340 --> 15:34.900]  It's going down. So get ready with your family and prepare yourselves. Because civilization
[15:34.900 --> 15:41.820]  as you know it is over. But at the end of this, the globalist and their master that
[15:41.820 --> 15:48.460]  have launched this attack will be in chains and the new civilization, not their build
[15:48.460 --> 15:54.700]  back better, but God's civilization will be built on their ashes, not ours. Stay with

[18:46.500 --> 18:53.580]  survival items right now at preparewithalex.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com.
[18:53.580 --> 18:56.540]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[18:56.540 --> 19:06.260]  is get ahead of inflation now because inflation is just beginning. I want to say brain force
[19:06.260 --> 19:12.180]  is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's
[19:12.180 --> 19:16.540]  like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm
[19:16.540 --> 19:22.260]  talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best
[19:22.260 --> 19:26.700]  out there. Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry, you
[19:26.700 --> 19:30.540]  want something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's
[19:30.540 --> 19:34.220]  so good. It might be. I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat
[19:34.220 --> 19:40.500]  five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night. So
[19:40.500 --> 19:49.220]  your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off
[19:49.220 --> 19:52.940]  of it. But you know, as I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't
[19:52.940 --> 19:54.700]  lie to you. I just can't do it.
[19:54.700 --> 20:24.580]  I have stated this point probably 5,000 times in the last 20 years. I've been on there
[20:24.580 --> 20:30.340]  28, but things really came into focus 20 years ago as evidenced by the thousands of clubs
[20:30.340 --> 20:34.060]  out there making the rounds the Internet before we predicted all of this from the enemy's
[20:34.060 --> 20:40.060]  own documents. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show Sunday edition. I'm going to put it to
[20:40.060 --> 20:46.380]  you this way. We have all the globalist battle plans. We have all their operational manuals.
[20:46.380 --> 20:53.220]  We know their system up one side down the other and they wanted to have a worldwide collapse
[20:53.220 --> 20:59.620]  where you believe, oh, viruses came out of a jungle. Global warming is your fault. Oh,
[20:59.620 --> 21:05.380]  all these Kim trailing. Oh, no, that that's humans causing all the bad weather. Oh, yeah,
[21:05.380 --> 21:08.780]  humans with geoengineering and oh, the collapse of the border and the currency. That's all
[21:08.780 --> 21:16.380]  by accident. We didn't know printing quadrillions and currency would do this. They wanted a
[21:16.380 --> 21:21.940]  worldwide collapse where the big mega corporations could collapse all the governments, blame
[21:21.940 --> 21:28.300]  the governments. They said this at the Davos group on television and then have the people
[21:28.300 --> 21:32.700]  all destroy their governments, bring down the civilization and then have the new world
[21:32.700 --> 21:39.620]  order rolling as the saviors. But if they're exposed for how they orchestrated it and now
[21:39.620 --> 21:46.140]  everybody knows they have to block the comments on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and
[21:46.140 --> 21:52.260]  everywhere on the Davos group and for Pfizer and for Bill and Melinda Gates, because you'll
[21:52.260 --> 21:58.820]  have 10,000 comments to one literally quoting them, talking about how people know they're
[21:58.820 --> 22:04.740]  the enemy, how they're depopulationist, how they planned it all. They'll never put the
[22:04.740 --> 22:10.220]  genie back in the bottle unless they have a huge nuclear war and all the powers off
[22:10.220 --> 22:15.420]  for years and billions of us die right away. And then they think they can reorganize because
[22:15.420 --> 22:19.900]  their emergency governmental systems are still in place.
[22:19.900 --> 22:25.020]  But the bureaucracy and the police and the social contract serves the people with its
[22:25.020 --> 22:34.700]  problems is being dismantled in front of us. A controlled demolition. And so we're not
[22:34.700 --> 22:40.300]  in beta of the great reset, the new world order. We're not in agenda 21 anymore. That
[22:40.300 --> 22:44.540]  was just the setup of this. When they launched it officially with the treaty in the UN in
[22:44.540 --> 22:53.020]  1992 at Rio de Janeiro, we are now in operations. And it's not going well for the new world
[22:53.020 --> 22:58.060]  order, but they don't care. Just like Hitler getting his ass kicked at two years into World
[22:58.060 --> 23:07.700]  War II, doubled down and invaded Russia. And the new world orders on the same thing here.
[23:07.700 --> 23:14.500]  They've doubled down and they've got anthropologists and sociologists in every country using
[23:14.500 --> 23:19.140]  cultural data and information to turn the people against each other so we fight with
[23:19.140 --> 23:27.860]  each other. And that may get a certain percentage of the population to be rabbit trailed off,
[23:27.860 --> 23:33.140]  but it's not affecting a large minority of people of every race, color, and creed that
[23:33.140 --> 23:39.820]  understand what's happening. And so if the blame for the global meltdown goes to Bill
[23:39.820 --> 23:44.740]  Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds and the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller
[23:44.740 --> 23:56.700]  Endowment and the whole neoliberal world, it's over for them. It's still gonna be rough.
[23:56.700 --> 24:02.700]  It's still gonna be bad. But under their plan, the collapse goes on forever and ever until
[24:02.700 --> 24:11.100]  at least 80% of us are dead. Both their actuaries show 90 plus percent. And so the only chance
[24:11.100 --> 24:15.380]  we've got, the only card we've got to play, which by the way is total victory, is to expose
[24:15.380 --> 24:21.580]  these people like our lives depend on it because they do and tell everybody what's coming next
[24:21.580 --> 24:26.500]  so they know. How'd I tell you three years ago, next they'll do climate lockdowns and
[24:26.500 --> 24:34.140]  power outages and cut off the food because it's the damn plan. And there's nothing more
[24:34.140 --> 24:38.620]  frustrating than having the enemy playbook and telling people they're about to run this
[24:38.620 --> 24:42.100]  play and they run it. They're about to run this play. They're about to run that play
[24:42.100 --> 24:52.620]  over and over again. And people slowly start to listen, but not fast enough. So it's a
[24:52.620 --> 25:00.300]  mixed bag, as they say. There are riots in over a hundred countries. Major governments
[25:00.300 --> 25:05.380]  have fallen. The Japanese real prime minister has party still in power. Abe was still running
[25:05.380 --> 25:15.100]  things. Assassinated. Boris Johnson resigns. The head of OPEC mysteriously dies. Georgia
[25:15.100 --> 25:22.820]  guide stones are destroyed. Stock market crashes. And all over the world. People because there's
[25:22.820 --> 25:30.380]  no food on the store shelves. There's no money. There's no fuel. All done by design.
[25:30.380 --> 25:36.220]  The central banks, the big AI systems deliberately doing this to bring in a global crisis, to
[25:36.220 --> 25:42.940]  bring in their one world currency, their cashless society, their social credit score, their carbon
[25:42.940 --> 25:50.500]  tax, their vaccine passport. And they're all announcing it as a solution. And they said
[25:50.500 --> 26:01.700]  they would use a solution. But the public knows it's them in Europe, in Western Europe,
[26:01.700 --> 26:12.060]  in Eastern Europe, in Sri Lanka, in India, in Greece, in Mexico, everywhere. It's the
[26:12.060 --> 26:20.340]  same thing by design, a complex system, computer run that the globalists know they can manipulate
[26:20.340 --> 26:25.780]  and shut down whenever they want. And they'll continue to do that to consolidate power, to
[26:25.780 --> 26:32.860]  double, triple their profits every year, until we grow up and learn how the scam works and
[26:32.860 --> 26:42.860]  say no to it. And the good news is I've been monitoring Australia. I've been monitoring
[26:42.860 --> 26:49.620]  New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Albania. I've been monitoring the Netherlands and Germany
[26:49.620 --> 26:55.900]  and France, the UK, the US. I've been monitoring it all. And the leaders of the movements are
[26:55.900 --> 27:01.420]  anti-New World Order. The signs are against Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab. The demands are
[27:01.420 --> 27:04.660]  against the central banks and those turning off the economies and saying they're going
[27:04.660 --> 27:08.940]  to shut down one-third of the farming in the countries this year as they announce all the
[27:08.940 --> 27:17.540]  new bug factories being created to feed you bugs. And crops, given nutrients from human
[27:17.540 --> 27:23.660]  dead bodies being rendered down, I mean, it's a dystopia that the New World Order is building
[27:23.660 --> 27:29.700]  and bringing forward against us. And all we got to do is recognize them and say no to
[27:29.700 --> 27:38.300]  them and reject the Hollywood scum and reject the corporate media trash, who are truly mercenaries
[27:38.300 --> 27:44.700]  bought and paid for up on their pedestals, telling us to go against our instincts, to
[27:44.700 --> 27:49.820]  turn our children over to them, to turn our lives over to them and to submit to their
[27:49.820 --> 28:03.380]  lies. Literal perverts, literal scumbags. In Austin, Texas, on the last days of school
[28:03.380 --> 28:08.980]  this year, we're showing you footage dancing with the elementary students, who men dressed
[28:08.980 --> 28:14.540]  as women coming to visit the school, then spend their time with them as part of pedophile
[28:14.540 --> 28:22.940]  pride. That's going on miles from where our studio is right now. If you're a radio
[28:22.940 --> 28:29.500]  listener, you're blessed, you don't have to look at this. This is unbelievable. All right,

[33:01.120 --> 33:09.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:09.640 --> 33:25.600]  It's never going to get any better, don't look for it, be happy with what you got.
[33:25.600 --> 33:28.880]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[33:28.880 --> 33:33.840]  I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business and
[33:33.840 --> 33:39.120]  just to control things and make all the important decisions, forget the politicians, the politicians
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.400]  are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[33:43.400 --> 33:51.160]  You don't, you have no choice, you have owners, they own you, they own everything, they own
[33:51.160 --> 33:55.560]  all the important land, they own and control the corporations, they've long since bought
[33:55.560 --> 33:58.480]  and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the
[33:58.480 --> 34:02.600]  judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies so they control
[34:02.600 --> 34:05.160]  just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[34:05.160 --> 34:08.280]  They got you by the balls.
[34:08.280 --> 34:14.280]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the
[34:14.280 --> 34:19.080]  machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with a lower
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.640]  pay, the longer hours to reduce benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension
[34:23.640 --> 34:27.600]  that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they're coming for your social
[34:27.600 --> 34:33.240]  security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[34:33.240 --> 34:36.160]  It's a big club and you ain't in it.
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.800]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[34:41.800 --> 34:42.800]  You better believe it.
[34:42.800 --> 34:45.080]  So what specifically did they do?
[34:45.080 --> 34:48.880]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given
[34:48.880 --> 34:50.360]  to just so you understand.
[34:50.360 --> 34:51.360]  A lot of money.
[34:51.360 --> 34:54.760]  You and I are not in the big club.
[34:54.760 --> 34:57.360]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[34:57.360 --> 35:02.520]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[35:02.520 --> 35:04.360]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want.
[35:04.360 --> 35:07.840]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[35:07.840 --> 35:11.720]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[35:11.720 --> 35:13.720]  They're not interested in that.
[35:13.720 --> 35:15.720]  That doesn't help them.
[35:15.720 --> 35:16.720]  That's against their interest.
[35:16.720 --> 35:17.720]  That's right.
[35:17.720 --> 35:22.560]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[35:22.560 --> 35:30.920]  We are now inside the Great Reset Global Collapse New World Order.
[35:30.920 --> 35:35.120]  Every day we're on air as a blessing to be warning the planet, we've built stiff resistance
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.080]  to them worldwide.
[35:37.080 --> 35:38.440]  Their plan will not work now.
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.200]  It will fail, but they've already committed to us, which is going to be very explosive
[35:43.200 --> 35:44.200]  and destructive.
[35:44.200 --> 35:47.400]  We're showing you footage in Sri Lanka.
[35:47.400 --> 35:52.120]  Yesterday, as millions of people broke through the police lines and stormed the government
[35:52.120 --> 35:58.920]  capital complex, burning down the president's house, government officials fled by helicopter
[35:58.920 --> 36:07.240]  to Navy ships and have evacuated.
[36:07.240 --> 36:13.800]  Our media, our control media is calling this a protest.
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.120]  Here's folks inside the government palace on the government treadmills in the government
[36:20.120 --> 36:24.560]  swimming pools.
[36:24.560 --> 36:29.160]  And if they don't identify it as the New World Order and globalism, it will just be used
[36:29.160 --> 36:33.280]  to destabilize the country and the globalists will come in and buy it up and put it in the
[36:33.280 --> 36:34.880]  dollar and lower the standard of living.
[36:34.880 --> 36:39.240]  But if they identify it as the New World Order and put in a new government that's against
[36:39.240 --> 36:42.120]  the globalist, then they can dig out of it.
[36:42.120 --> 36:50.040]  But in South Africa and up in North, Eastern Africa and Kenya and in Europe, Eastern, Western,
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.880]  all over the world, people are rioting because the food supply has been cut off.
[36:54.880 --> 36:57.760]  The energy prices are too high.
[36:57.760 --> 37:04.200]  From Italy to Albania, from Canada to Mexico, the people are awake and are identifying what's
[37:04.200 --> 37:09.320]  happening, particularly the Dutch farmers who were told one third of their cows must
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.200]  be slaughtered and they cannot do basic farming anymore because it's, quote, bad for the planet,
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.000]  which it's not, it's part of the planned destabilization, which the globalists believe will take you
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.480]  to your knees.
[37:20.480 --> 37:26.120]  But if you know it's them, it will take them to prison.
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.560]  Same thing in Panama.
[37:27.560 --> 37:33.960]  It's over 100 countries right now have mass demonstrations against the supply chain breakdowns
[37:33.960 --> 37:39.320]  and against the starvation and energy cost, which we told you 30 months ago, 30 plus months
[37:39.320 --> 37:40.320]  ago.
[37:40.320 --> 37:42.920]  How many months ago is January and February of 2020?
[37:42.920 --> 37:43.920]  I keep saying 30 months.
[37:43.920 --> 37:54.360]  So a few weeks ago I did the math, yeah, 30 months ago, 30 months ago, we told you exactly
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.480]  what would happen and showed you the economic numbers and now we're here and we're telling
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.880]  you what's coming next and what is the corporate answer, censor people, shut people down and
[38:03.880 --> 38:07.640]  the fools that work for Silicon Valley and all of them think they'll be protected being
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.600]  part of something so monstrous as a global destabilization plan to collapse fossil fuels
[38:13.600 --> 38:18.080]  and regular agriculture and bring in their replacement when they don't have one because
[38:18.080 --> 38:21.560]  they're replacing you, you're non-essential.
[38:21.560 --> 38:25.800]  That 30-year-old George Carlin saying they just want you dumb enough to do the paperwork
[38:25.800 --> 38:27.000]  and run the machines.
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.320]  They don't need you to do the paperwork and run the machines anymore because it's artificial
[38:31.320 --> 38:37.120]  intelligence, it's robots and they've announced it in every damn establishment publication
[38:37.120 --> 38:45.080]  from the Economist to the Sunday Times of London to the Washington Post and the New
[38:45.080 --> 38:48.360]  York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
[38:48.360 --> 38:55.040]  They're announcing that we're collapsing this on purpose as part of a great new transition.
[38:55.040 --> 39:03.320]  Joe Biden, the puppet president, the placeholder for Obama's Third Administration, said on
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.280]  Friday I played the clip on the Saturday show, he said, yeah, it's not Putin and that's
[39:08.280 --> 39:17.840]  not the gas stations, he got off the teleprompter, he said it's a great transition that we're
[39:17.840 --> 39:21.720]  part of and so has the head of the energy department, the head of the Department of
[39:21.720 --> 39:26.560]  Commerce and Transportation and all of them.
[39:26.560 --> 39:42.000]  So when you see the footage from Sri Lanka and Peru and Albania and the Netherlands,
[39:42.000 --> 39:51.200]  they call it protests when they burn down buildings because they want the destabilization
[39:51.200 --> 39:56.600]  worldwide but here in the heart of the empire they don't, not yet, they want to bring down
[39:56.600 --> 40:04.200]  the cities, bring down the police, to bring in their control but they don't want the
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.560]  actual revolution they control yet.
[40:08.560 --> 40:13.600]  So we've got to educate the public about the main players and we've got to do it right
[40:13.600 --> 40:19.280]  now but it's a very simple economic equation that's well known.
[40:19.280 --> 40:25.680]  If you go above 50%, the average family for food costs and energy and in many of these
[40:25.680 --> 40:34.480]  countries it's 60%, 70%, you get total, absolute, bad luck.
[40:34.480 --> 40:43.360]  Which further destroys infrastructure, further destroys supply chain, further destroys confidence
[40:43.360 --> 40:49.640]  and then there's the new world order ready to swoop in with all the answers to all the
[40:49.640 --> 40:59.840]  problems and then we have the paradox, the paradox of people that go along with this,
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.760]  the university professors, the bureaucrats, the talk show host, all of them just believing
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.320]  if you know, well I'll take care of myself, I'll follow the talking points and then I'll
[41:09.320 --> 41:15.640]  be protected down the road when you're destroying the infrastructure and the economy and the
[41:15.640 --> 41:21.880]  due process and the chivalry that is protected everyone.
[41:21.880 --> 41:25.400]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back with the depopulation announcements
[41:25.400 --> 41:31.680]  that have been made, big Trump news, big economy news, big COVID-19, new lockdown news, new
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.480]  you will eat bug news, new abortion fight news and so much more but I just want listeners
[41:36.480 --> 41:43.320]  to understand something, we have great products everybody needs and if you buy those products

[41:51.160 --> 41:57.760]  able to change this that things are so bad that minus big donors keeping us on the air
[41:57.760 --> 42:02.000]  I don't know how we're going to do it because believe me, you see the numbers, the takedown
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.440]  of the factories, the takedown of the infrastructure is insane so get high quality supplements,

[46:11.840 --> 46:16.440]  all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.640]  I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.840]  your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[46:26.840 --> 46:30.160]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[46:30.160 --> 46:34.200]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[46:34.200 --> 46:38.520]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[46:38.520 --> 46:43.480]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started
[46:43.480 --> 46:48.520]  noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[46:48.520 --> 46:54.880]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[46:54.880 --> 47:18.880]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[47:18.880 --> 47:24.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, we now take you live to the Central Texas
[47:24.960 --> 47:34.440]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance, it's Alex Jones.
[47:34.440 --> 47:41.680]  I am here to reveal my hidden talent, eating, micro livestock, cornworms, they're still
[47:41.680 --> 47:57.960]  alive, very moist, chewy, can't quite describe the flavor, but need a little water.
[47:57.960 --> 48:01.760]  Let's try the second glass, shall we?
[48:01.760 --> 48:07.720]  Just a little side note, two billion people in the world eat bugs, and I'm one of them,
[48:07.720 --> 48:20.080]  because here we go, we have some me worms, I'm telling you, I'd win survivor, that is
[48:20.080 --> 48:32.440]  a fruity taste, I'd recommend it, here we have, oh, crickets, oh, nothing, oh, awesome,
[48:32.440 --> 48:46.880]  like nothing you've ever tasted, like a hairy nut, don't, oh my gosh, a nut from the shell.
[48:46.880 --> 49:02.000]  And now, for dessert, the fried grasshopper, these are amazing, these are exquisite, they
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.800]  are grasshoppers, I recommend them, but only one.
[49:07.800 --> 49:11.680]  Thank you for spending so much time with me and watching me eat bugs.
[49:11.680 --> 49:19.560]  These are grasshopper kebabs, teriyaki marinated, quite delicious, I hardly encourage that
[49:19.560 --> 49:32.520]  you try one, okay, on it, you want to try it, you want to try one, I'll try it, you
[49:32.520 --> 49:55.400]  know, I wouldn't serve it if it wasn't good, that's my model.
[49:55.400 --> 49:59.360]  So you know, also right here, if you have kids, you're always serving them ants on
[49:59.360 --> 50:07.080]  a log with raisins, come on, really, these are ants on a log with ants.
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.720]  So these are actual ants.
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.120]  These are black ants from China, and you know, in China, they say that ants are medicinal,
[50:14.120 --> 50:15.120]  they sell...
[50:15.120 --> 50:18.200]  And in China, they're executed by this race of the government, and in China, they're
[50:18.200 --> 50:24.560]  still in lockdown, and in China, they're communist, and in China, they have a one-child policy.
[50:24.560 --> 50:32.000]  You can say, oh, this is just fear factor Joe Rogan 2.0, no, it's official UN, Klaus Schwab
[50:32.000 --> 50:39.600]  dogma, you eat some bugs, you will own nothing, you will have nothing, you will like it.
[50:39.600 --> 50:44.160]  They are teaching you that pedophilia is good, they're teaching you that euthanasia is good,
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.080]  they're teaching you that killing born babies is good, they're teaching you to put up with
[50:49.080 --> 50:55.480]  being run over and giving up your life force and your survival instinct.
[50:55.480 --> 51:02.240]  And everything we do here is about getting you to rediscover that life force and getting
[51:02.240 --> 51:07.040]  you to help others rediscover it and realizing we're being set up, we're being attacked,
[51:07.040 --> 51:10.960]  these are obviously the bad guys.
[51:10.960 --> 51:18.160]  You read further into their official battle plans, they talk about the post-human world,
[51:18.160 --> 51:22.560]  how they're ending civilization, and yeah, we're lazy, we're dumbed down many others,
[51:22.560 --> 51:30.880]  but the people running it help do it and are the worst people on earth.
[51:30.880 --> 51:35.720]  So the global meltdown is here, the global collapse is here, and the globalists thought
[51:35.720 --> 51:40.680]  they could do this and pose as savers to bring in their system, but around the world, and
[51:40.680 --> 51:47.680]  I salute people fighting back peacefully, they're losing, and the population knows what they're
[51:47.680 --> 51:53.200]  facing, they want to have governments, they control, do bad policies, have us destroy
[51:53.200 --> 51:59.000]  our own governments, everything collapses, and then they come in with their new policies
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.800]  as the saviors that make things a hundred times worse.
[52:05.800 --> 52:10.520]  And remember, when they overthrow governments around the world and storm government buildings
[52:10.520 --> 52:16.760]  and attack politicians, our media says it's a peaceful protest, but when a million people
[52:16.760 --> 52:21.960]  show up in DC and 600, 700 go in the capital, most of them peaceful, waved them by police,
[52:21.960 --> 52:30.120]  it's worse than Pearl Harbor, it's worse than 9-11, they said that.
[52:30.120 --> 52:36.560]  That ladies and gentlemen is called brainwashing, that's called saying don't believe your lying
[52:36.560 --> 52:40.600]  eyes, don't believe your smell, your taste, your touch, don't believe your five senses
[52:40.600 --> 52:47.400]  or your six senses, go along with our fraud.
[52:47.400 --> 53:00.440]  Now I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 stacks of news here, and
[53:00.440 --> 53:05.840]  I intend when we start the next hour to cover quite a bit of this, and what we know is going
[53:05.840 --> 53:12.720]  to come next, and we're going to do it. But at the end of the day, if we do not expose
[53:12.720 --> 53:18.360]  the fact that this is a world government, corporate ideology to destroy all their cultures,
[53:18.360 --> 53:24.160]  all their systems of unity, and to make us absolutely dependent and pathetic so they
[53:24.160 --> 53:29.840]  can have their way with us, if you don't realize that, nothing else matters, because all the
[53:29.840 --> 53:35.800]  pedophilia, and all the chemical infertility, and all the endocrine disruptors, and all the
[53:35.800 --> 53:43.560]  attacks, and everything else that flows from this thing are symptoms of the larger problem
[53:43.560 --> 53:50.920]  and the larger globalist disease. And so we're going to expose that in the next hour, and
[53:50.920 --> 53:55.240]  then I'll show you what it takes over with Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m., and then we come
[53:55.240 --> 53:59.920]  back weekday mornings at infowars.com, and on many radio and TV stations across the country
[53:59.920 --> 54:05.160]  at 8 a.m. central, with the wonderful, informative dynamic, and all those amazing guests, Harrison
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.920]  Smith, 8 to 11 a.m., and then Alex Jones, who's truly for four hours, and I'll destroy
[54:09.920 --> 54:18.040]  her for three hours, and we are embattled, and we are so victorious, and we are, thanks
[54:18.040 --> 54:26.120]  to you and our guests, this whole organization is legendary, and really is the most dynamic,
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.800]  most effective, most over-the-target organization there is, and that all glory goes to God,
[54:32.800 --> 54:38.280]  and of course, God working through you. But I cannot stress enough to you understand that,
[54:38.280 --> 54:45.640]  but let that sink in, because my greatest frustration is watching the collapse of civilization,
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.920]  and knowing that day's coming, if the enemy continues to push their operation, and we
[54:49.920 --> 54:55.760]  don't stop them, to where they start turning the power off on a routine basis, they have
[54:55.760 --> 55:00.480]  fake cyber attacks they launch, they use for total expanded citizenship control, where
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.720]  they arrest their political opposition, and then you will look back on these days of very
[55:06.720 --> 55:21.040]  hard turmoil, and of death, and suicide, and bankruptcy, and collapse as the good old days,
[55:21.040 --> 55:28.280]  and so that's where we are right now, and I am extremely honored, and extremely blessed
[55:28.280 --> 55:36.520]  to be here with you on this Sunday night, July 10th, 2022, talking about this, but there's
[55:36.520 --> 55:42.680]  just such a sense of urgency, and I want all of you, from the listeners and viewers, from
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.120]  our affiliates and sponsors, with this great crew, I'm looking at right now, to just let
[55:47.120 --> 55:52.680]  it burn into your brains that this is real. There's thousands of fake political movements,
[55:52.680 --> 55:57.760]  and millions of different choices of entertainment, and all these false corporate controlled cultures,
[55:57.760 --> 56:03.880]  but we're here really looking at State Department of Random 200. We're really here looking at
[56:03.880 --> 56:09.200]  the Club of Rome plans in 1967, we're really here with the Lake Bilderberg Group documents,
[56:09.200 --> 56:16.600]  we're really here looking at Operation Lockstep, we're really here listening and watching to
[56:16.600 --> 56:20.560]  what Klaus Schwab and the Bilderberg Group do, that's what the Bilderberg Group, that's
[56:20.560 --> 56:30.120]  what runs Davos, and we're in the real world. That's why there's such a hubbub, that's why
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.080]  everybody's so upset in the power structure. That's why, because they know this is all
[56:34.080 --> 56:39.080]  real, and they don't even want their own henchmen, and their own minions listening to this, because
[56:39.080 --> 56:42.720]  they already see what's going on, they know I'm telling the truth, and it completely blows
[56:42.720 --> 56:50.320]  them away, and let me give you the rest of the good news. Because we're in a bad situation,
[56:50.320 --> 57:01.160]  a kettle of fish, as they say. Many people that made billions of dollars in the system
[57:01.160 --> 57:05.080]  now know it's predatory and periodable, and now can look down the road and see they'll
[57:05.080 --> 57:10.520]  be destroyed as well, and they understand that due process and chivalry and civilization
[57:10.520 --> 57:17.320]  is good, because what is it to have $100 billion, or $20 billion, or $190 billion, if it's
[57:17.320 --> 57:23.640]  fiat and it's a lie, and if you're not going to have a civilization to spend it in, and
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.000]  you can look at what's happening, and no, there's not going to be globalist reservations
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.440]  and break off civilizations that succeed. You can see the whole thing is a trick of
[57:32.440 --> 57:36.960]  Satan and is bringing all of civilization and the world down, and you decide to not
[57:36.960 --> 57:44.080]  be part of it. That's the real do-sex in this whole situation. That's the real wild card.
[57:44.080 --> 57:50.640]  For number two, live, straight ahead. I think I'll open the phones up as well.

[1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:20.120]  In April of 2022, Biden's energy department led by the great reset minion Jennifer Granholm
[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:28.080]  announced the sale of 950,000 strategic petroleum reserve barrels to Unipek or Sinopek, which
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:33.680]  is wholly owned by the Chinese government. As of last month, more than 5 million barrels
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:39.440]  of oil were released from the US emergency reserves. At least one of those shipments
[1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:45.200]  of American crude went to China, according to Reuters. In 2015, a private equity firm
[1:00:45.200 --> 1:00:52.400]  co-founded by Hunter Biden, Bohai Harvest RST, previously owned a stake in the Sinopek
[1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:59.200]  marketing, valued at $1.7 million. While Americans plummet headlong into a recession
[1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:05.480]  and gas prices double, the Biden family is selling off our assets. This is high treason.
[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:10.320]  Today, President Biden announced a plan to release 1 million barrels of oil a day for
[1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:16.360]  the next 180 days from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It is the largest release since its
[1:01:16.360 --> 1:01:20.280]  creation. How long is it fair to expect American drivers
[1:01:20.280 --> 1:01:24.400]  and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:30.040]  As long as it takes. And in addition to getting other nations to move forward a total of 240
[1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:34.960]  million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:40.760]  1 million barrels per day, that is the largest release in US history. And it amounts to roughly
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:45.920]  a third of the reserve's current supply. We are living in a present when the enormity
[1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:52.240]  of Joe Biden's treason is finally coming to light even to those who refuse to see his
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.240]  central role in Klaus Schwab's great reset. But the greatest threat on this front springs
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:03.960]  from the distinct and liberal and external actors who equate their success with fracturing
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:09.840]  the liberal international order. To limit global warming, you are demanding
[1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:19.120]  to help to coal, oil and gas exploration. To the development and to the financing of
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:25.480]  this exploration. As well, you are asking firms to replace any
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:33.680]  corporate board directors who is unwilling to transition to cleaner energy sources.
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:40.800]  And when it comes to the gas prices, we are going through an incredible transition that
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:44.600]  is taking place that God willing when it is over, we will be stronger and the world will
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:48.800]  be stronger unless we rely on fossil fuels when this is over.
[1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.560]  And as food and energy are systematically dismantled, and as China and India siphon
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.920]  off American fuel reserves, while American inflation is at a historic high, Biden has
[1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:07.520]  already signed off $54 billion in taxpayer dollars to his corrupt partners in Ukraine,
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:12.720]  along with a laundry list of military aid. Based on our investigative units reporting,
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:19.000]  the US Attorney in Delaware has been probing a number of issues. They include tax fraud,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.200]  tax evasion, money laundering, as well as whether Hunter James Biden and their business
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:30.160]  associates complied with foreign lobbying laws. The sooner Americans comprehend that
[1:03:30.160 --> 1:03:36.000]  heavily compromised, Joe Biden is merely the puppet of New World Order globalist sabotage
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.880]  to destroy the United States, the sooner we can salvage what is left of our borders,
[1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:47.840]  our military, our elections, our economy, our energy, our schools, our farmland and
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:04:15.520]  our future, John Bowne reporting.
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:32.320]  We

[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:44.200]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me

[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:18.760]  Transition that's not debatable. You can call in and say I'm wrong, but I think it's easy to say
[1:07:18.760 --> 1:07:20.240]  I think it's crucial to say
[1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:25.880]  What is it like to live in a corporate private fascist world government that's above the law?
[1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:31.920]  And are you going to just submit to it or where do you think this is going next and how do we peacefully stand up?

[1:13:03.280 --> 1:13:05.280]  all these libtard articles
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:13.400]  Dr. James Smith of York you wearing his bane. Oh about my not fit
[1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:19.920]  In a bakery yesterday big male maskless customer using cash. That's even dirtier
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.560]  Turns around and sees me and for older women all wearing masks sheepishly. He says okay
[1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:29.720]  I guess I should be wearing a mask, you know, that's a made-up story
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:35.560]  But it's all about shaming you into the mental psychology of your dirty your bad
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:42.800]  So these high-precision control can brainwash you Los Angeles set to reinstate the vast the mask mandates
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:48.680]  But more and more people
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:54.120]  Are saying no
[1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:58.480]  To the fraud and it's all about the population. It's all about humans being dirty
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:04.240]  It's all about humans being bad. Look at this economist publication. Oh mother Rothschild headline
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.160]  Low fertility is here to stay
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:10.280]  We should embrace it
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:13.800]  Yeah, don't ask why sperm counts are down 90%
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.640]  Don't ask why autism is up 10,000%
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.480]  Don't ask just embrace your death
[1:14:22.200 --> 1:14:23.080]  and
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:30.040]  If you can't kill a baby in the one where after they're born get them as little kids to have their testicles cut off
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:34.320]  Or their ovaries or breasts cut off and I went to the doctor and said cut my finger off
[1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:39.160]  They call the patty wagon to the mental institution, but oh if I want to cut my son's balls off
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:42.720]  It's a good thing. It's a liberal
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:51.600]  From safe and legal and rare to we love killing babies a new incredible clip
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:56.440]  Pro abortion protesters creams. We love killing babies. We have hours of this
[1:14:56.440 --> 1:14:59.960]  But it's a new clip will air coming back next segment
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:12.000]  And it goes on and on oh and all the churches now have the rainbow flags and protect trans kids
[1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:19.960]  Progressivism will hollow out your religion and wear its skin like a trophy boy. That is
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  perfectly
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:24.120]  said
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.200]  Then we have Austin, Texas
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:33.480]  I can't homeschool my kids because they need to be properly socialized with pedophiles coming to visit them at the schools
[1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:36.440]  Democrat judge blocks Texas for investigating two families
[1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:38.800]  Cutting their children's testicles off
[1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:42.000]  Yeah, don't you know he spank your kid. They'll take him away
[1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:47.880]  But if you want to cut their balls off well then my goodness, why didn't you just say so?
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:53.120]  Or cut your daughter's breast off. That's even more liberal some of them and have their uterus is cut out
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.120]  That's even more liberal

[1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:25.360]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger
[1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:30.360]  Already now that probably increase by the end of the year
[1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:36.360]  Because this crisis will be with us until we really have found remedy
[1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:43.360]  So we have to prepare for a more angry world and how to prepare
[1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:48.360]  It means to take the necessary action to create the fair world
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:57.360]  To see that we provide everybody with decent access to the health system
[1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:04.360]  That we make sure that those people who are really left behind
[1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:09.360]  And I'm not speaking only on national level so I'm speaking also internationally
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:32.360]  If I see now, it's a tragedy
[1:21:32.360 --> 1:21:38.360]  We love killing babies. Klaus Schwab wants to make it a fair world after he locked down the world economy
[1:21:38.360 --> 1:21:41.360]  Release the deadly virus, push the poison shot
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:46.360]  It's Sunday July 10th, we're well into the second hour here
[1:21:46.360 --> 1:21:53.360]  We're taking your phone calls right now, Sabrina Mark, Vinny, Betty, Larkin, Don, Brian and others
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:57.360]  Let's talk to Larkin first in FEMA Region A
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:03.360]  What is it like to be in the middle of the New World Order? Because Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Joe Biden
[1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:06.360]  They all admit we're in the liberal New World Order right now
[1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:09.360]  What's it like for you to be living in the New World Order?
[1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:15.360]  It's incredible. I've got Bill Gates taking over farmland just down the road
[1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:20.360]  The Attorney General here in North Dakota is perfectly fine with that
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:28.360]  And I don't know, as a meat packer, I'm seeing farmers come in, making no money, farms going under
[1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:37.360]  It's crazy, we're watching the implementation of quality piven, the devaluation of our dollar
[1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:45.360]  You can hardly fill your gas tank for less than a hundred bucks and it's wild time to be alive
[1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  Larkin, are folks waking up in North Dakota?
[1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:52.360]  They are. Stickers all over, depend on the First Amendment
[1:22:53.360 --> 1:22:57.360]  Stop signs with the Reds, Bill Gates, stickers, they're popping up everywhere
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:03.360]  People are talking in the diners, they're talking in the gas stations, they have had it
[1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:07.360]  And it's wonderful to see this movement across the world of people
[1:23:09.360 --> 1:23:13.360]  Waking up to who the puppet masters really are
[1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:20.360]  People aren't aware of BlackRock and who these corporate rulers really are
[1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.360]  They need to watch Monopoly, who owns the world
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:28.360]  I agree, let me say this Larkin, I want to give you the credit
[1:23:28.360 --> 1:23:31.360]  It's not just me that gets it, it's all of us together
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:37.360]  You understand that what you've done, you called in, you're obviously a listener and you spread the word
[1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:41.360]  But we've done together, brother, it's so positive, I'm getting chills right now
[1:23:41.360 --> 1:23:46.360]  We've not been caught flat-footed, so they're executing this, counting on us not knowing it's them
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:48.360]  They're screwed, how do you see that unfolding?
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:54.360]  Because when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, that is explosive
[1:23:55.360 --> 1:24:01.360]  Exactly, exactly, and people are, I mean we've got the whole show trial with
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  January 6th and you see how the propaganda machine can definitely be used against the people
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:12.360]  But I think they kind of shot themselves in the foot with that because people are starting to see
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:18.360]  What the mainstream lying media really is and that's just a megaphone for the New World Order
[1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:22.360]  Absolutely, we love you brother, keep spreading the word North Dakota and we love you
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:27.360]  Let's talk to Sabrina in California, go ahead Sabrina
[1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:30.360]  Hi Alec, hi, how are you?
[1:24:30.360 --> 1:24:34.360]  I'm great talking to you, we're still on air and that's a big deal, it's all thanks to you and God
[1:24:34.360 --> 1:24:39.360]  I'm so grateful for that because I don't, when you were gone for that week and a half, it was just
[1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:42.360]  I just thought the worst, so I'm so glad you're back
[1:24:42.360 --> 1:24:50.360]  I just want to say that we would not have a ruling class if people simply just did not obey these unlawful
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:57.360]  unethical and unconstitutional orders and I don't know how to reach out to the law enforcement community
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:06.360]  Because those are the ones that need to really listen to you more because they're the ones that are going to turn their backs on us
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:15.360]  And I know that because I was married to somebody who 20 years ago used to talk about the New World Order all the time
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:21.360]  And then he rose up in his department, I'm not going to name which one, very well known cases
[1:25:21.360 --> 1:25:26.360]  And he won't even discuss it now, it's all, so he's been brainwashed
[1:25:26.360 --> 1:25:31.360]  Well they adapt to surviving, they believe going along with it will make them okay
[1:25:31.360 --> 1:25:35.360]  But they're going to find out in the end it will destroy them, I'm so sorry to hear that
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:41.360]  But thank God and Sabrina that you've kept your soul intact and it's obviously we're not mad at your ex for this
[1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:43.360]  We just feel very sorry for him right now
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:50.360]  Yeah, I mean I can tell you firsthand that just the stuff that I know that he has to watch and see
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:57.360]  And I think that really affects these law enforcement officers, they're just desensitized to everything
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.360]  Well they do, but I'm not going to tell any personal stories, but I've not talked about the things they've done to me
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:14.360]  And I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer, but I have been to the point where the system has said that we'll stop this
[1:26:14.360 --> 1:26:20.360]  I'm not talking about lawsuits, that's nothing, but things with my family if you'll just won't do this
[1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:26.360]  And then they don't kill you, they kill members of your family
[1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:31.360]  And some people know that we've definitely stayed the course and they know that
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:34.360]  So that's why they're really scared, they're scared of you
[1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:36.360]  And I appreciate you and I love you and I appreciate you
[1:26:36.360 --> 1:26:38.360]  Thank you Sabrina
[1:26:38.360 --> 1:26:42.360]  Let's go ahead and take another call, let's talk to a caller in Arizona
[1:26:42.360 --> 1:26:45.360]  Betty you're on the air, go ahead you're on the air
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:52.360]  Hey Alex, you're big on talking about the straw man and teaching people about false flags and how they misidentify
[1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:59.360]  But as a history buff, kind of like yourself, it's important to go back to the original straw man
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:02.360]  Which in our country became the birth certificate
[1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  And we were all bonded and insured and sold into slavery unbeknownst with these birth certificates
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:18.360]  And unless we claim dominion with these banksters who keep their secret off-book accounts on our bodies and sell us
[1:27:18.360 --> 1:27:22.360]  And wheel and deal us in Wall Street under the form of treasury bonds
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:28.360]  We can't take dominion back over those who seek to destroy us
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:36.360]  And the way to do something positive is to study this, check out the different, change your status
[1:27:36.360 --> 1:27:43.360]  We have different statuses under the State Department that have immunity against a lot of these strange things
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:49.360]  Statutes, mandates, and people are not aware of it because they haven't studied the history
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.360]  And they don't really give you information you need to make the proper choice
[1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:59.360]  Well Betty, there's no doubt that we're going under admiralty law and administrative law
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:01.360]  And the system just does whatever the hell it wants
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:07.360]  And I've experienced that in battling these people, they've already removed the law
[1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:10.360]  They've already brought us to an absolute tyranny
[1:28:10.360 --> 1:28:14.360]  And now they're preparing to execute that tyranny, thank you Betty
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:18.360]  Alright, we're going to go to break
[1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:24.360]  We're going to come back with Mark and Don and Mike and Brian and Coco
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:28.360]  And Vinnie and many other callers in the order they receive
[1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  And I love these calls, but I'm giving each caller a minute and a half so we can get to everybody
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  And I think everybody likes that fact I've been doing that, so no disrespect when I hang up on you
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:39.360]  You've got to get to everybody
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:42.360]  We'll be right back doing the verboten forbidden thing
[1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:46.360]  Humans that love God and justice and freedom in a good future
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:49.360]  Speaking together, it's beautiful
[1:28:49.360 --> 1:28:59.360]  We'll be right back, stay with us
[1:29:19.360 --> 1:29:21.360]  We'll be right back
[1:29:49.360 --> 1:30:04.360]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:09.360]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles, you see it every year
[1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:11.360]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:14.360]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:19.360]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:24.360]  Because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:29.360]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:30:29.360 --> 1:30:35.360]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money
[1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:40.360]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:46.360]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:51.360]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285
[1:30:51.360 --> 1:31:11.360]  833-904-285
[1:31:21.360 --> 1:31:26.360]  InfowarsStore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, InfowarsStore.com is where to get them folks
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:32.360]  And we do have the best supplements, I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information
[1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:36.360]  We do the best with our supplements as well
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:40.360]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke
[1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:43.360]  I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75% off
[1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:46.360]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed
[1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:49.360]  The hair and beard formula is working for me
[1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:52.360]  Quite well, I might add
[1:31:52.360 --> 1:31:57.360]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see them quite often now
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:01.360]  The globalists are making their move, their great reset is here
[1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:05.360]  They're coming for your children, they're coming for the value of your currency
[1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:12.360]  They're coming for your national sovereignty, they're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical tyranny
[1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:16.360]  They're coming for your free speech, they're coming for your privacy
[1:32:16.360 --> 1:32:20.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote
[1:32:20.360 --> 1:32:24.360]  And have your representative in government that you and your fellow Americans choose
[1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:29.360]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view
[1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:37.360]  2000 Mules is now available on DVD with expanded extras at infowarsstore.com
[1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:42.360]  You can also get the powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarsstore.com
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:46.360]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know
[1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:49.360]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice
[1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:53.360]  If they're planning to run the same scams again, this film can stop them if you take action
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:33:20.360]  infowarsstore.com, 2000 Mules
[1:33:20.360 --> 1:33:23.360]  You say you want to go to a place
[1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:31.360]  You say that you want to go to a land that's far away
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:40.360]  How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today
[1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:53.360]  You talk lots about God, freedom comes from the call, but that's not what this bitch wants
[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:57.360]  Not what I want, at all I want
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:10.360]  And now they're injecting six month old babies with their poison and have a stack of mainstream news
[1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:17.360]  They're betting it erases your men's system and causes blood clots and doesn't protect you
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:21.360]  And national polls show the vast majority of Americans know that
[1:34:21.360 --> 1:34:27.360]  So we're winning the fight, but they've already killed millions of people
[1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:32.360]  They're preparing new bio weapon releases that are far worse than what we just saw
[1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  We just lived the beta test
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:44.360]  Now our enemies are going operational
[1:34:44.360 --> 1:34:48.360]  But God is in control and God is holding our hand
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:51.360]  God has his hand on our shoulder with guardian angels
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:55.360]  And it's so real and I've been through so much and experienced so much
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:34:59.360]  I can't even tell you all about it because we don't give the enemy any operational information
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:04.360]  But just explain something, this is 100% real and you don't need me to tell you that anymore
[1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:06.360]  You've seen it for yourself
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:09.360]  So thank you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:17.360]  That is literally in defiance to everything these parasites and these psychopaths and these demons are doing
[1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:19.360]  It's a real blessing
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:22.360]  I'm exactly where I want to be
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:26.360]  I've just got to turn it loose and give it to God and stop getting so upset to see their operations
[1:35:26.360 --> 1:35:29.360]  Because in the end they will fail
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:38.360]  I give it to God here on here and ask God to bring me to the high place that King David talked about
[1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:42.360]  Quiet place the most high
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  And the lead got to direct me so that I can continue this operation because we have been given nothing but success
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:52.360]  Nothing but victory, it has been spectacular
[1:35:52.360 --> 1:36:02.360]  And you, the viewers and listeners, you did this and that's why when I salute you
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:09.360]  I'm not into self-harming but I just are typally want to take this dagger
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:14.360]  And just cut a finger off right on there to show you how much I appreciate you and what you've done
[1:36:14.360 --> 1:36:21.360]  Because giving up a finger to beat these people is nothing
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:25.360]  You have changed the world
[1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.360]  You have stood up against evil
[1:36:28.360 --> 1:36:30.360]  You have turned the tide
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:33.360]  And I salute you and I thank you
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  And you've got that from the very bottom of my heart
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  You've got my full commitment because you need to know in the universe they're real people
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.360]  You need to know in the universe there's people like you who aren't evil, who don't serve Satan
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:49.360]  That's why they all day say I'm an actor
[1:36:49.360 --> 1:36:51.360]  All day say I'm a fake
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:53.360]  All day say I'm a fraud with no evidence
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:56.360]  Because they know I didn't sell out to them
[1:36:56.360 --> 1:36:59.360]  They know you didn't sell out to them
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:02.360]  They know
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:05.360]  But I'm not going to cut my finger off to prove that
[1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.360]  You don't want me to
[1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:11.360]  But I will cut down the enemy
[1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:14.360]  I will resist the globalist and I will continue to do it
[1:37:14.360 --> 1:37:20.360]  And I just pray for providence
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:22.360]  And manifest destiny of God's plan
[1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:27.360]  And I pray you join me in that prayer
[1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:29.360]  Let's go to your phone calls
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:33.360]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:36.360]  Who has been holding the longest?
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:38.360]  Let's talk to Don in New York State
[1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:40.360]  You're on the air, welcome
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:42.360]  Yes, are you there?
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:44.360]  I am, brother, welcome
[1:37:44.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  Yes, sir, and it's a pleasure and a privilege to talk to you
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  I've been listening for years
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:52.360]  I didn't used to know if you were right, but now I do sadly
[1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.360]  Listen, for one reason I called the New World Order
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:37:58.360]  And the Great Reset and all of that
[1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:01.360]  I don't know if it's possible, but I'm a very country person
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:03.360]  I'm in the northern part of the state
[1:38:03.360 --> 1:38:06.360]  Great Adirondack Mountains, biggest wilderness
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:08.360]  The east of the Mississippi
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.360]  What a gorgeous place you live in
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:13.360]  Thank you, sir, I think so too
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:16.360]  I want to try to leave these people behind
[1:38:16.360 --> 1:38:19.360]  My buddies and I were planning to make our own ammo
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:21.360]  We'll mold our own lead for bullets
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:23.360]  And we're going to make our own black powder
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  That's great you're doing that
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:27.360]  But your real problem is going to be food
[1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:30.360]  Yes, sir, well, cotton fish
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360]  And heirloom crops if we can get them
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  And if hope that they leave us alone, we'll be all right
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:37.360]  And I don't know, but I wanted to throw that in
[1:38:37.360 --> 1:38:40.360]  Also to say that I have vacuum tube radio equipment
[1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.360]  Hoping that we'll stand and eat an EMS attack
[1:38:44.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  No, I think that's great, and I just think
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:48.360]  It's been half your time getting ready
[1:38:48.360 --> 1:38:50.360]  The other halfway can be pulled up, which I'm sure you're doing
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:52.360]  You're calling to talk radio right now, brother
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:53.360]  We love that
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:54.360]  Yes, sir
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.360]  And not only that, I got a diesel generator
[1:38:56.360 --> 1:38:58.360]  That's got old-time injection
[1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:01.360]  It's non-electronic, and I'm hoping that that keeps running
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:03.360]  Then we may be able to do a little listening
[1:39:03.360 --> 1:39:06.360]  And also some talking to him, operator
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.360]  Beautiful, Don, we love you
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:10.360]  Let's go to Coco in Michigan
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.360]  Coco, you're on the air, welcome
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  Hi, thank you for everything
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:16.360]  Thank you for being on the air
[1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:19.360]  Thank you for being so strong and so courageous
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:20.360]  Thank you
[1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:21.360]  Family, thank you
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:24.360]  So I did want to mention two things
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:28.360]  So my new response when anyone asked me to wear a mask
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  Which I obviously will not
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:32.360]  Is, what do you mean?
[1:39:32.360 --> 1:39:34.360]  I am a mask
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.360]  I identify as a mask
[1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.360]  And I find you to be highly offensive
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  Exactly, they risk people all the time
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:41.360]  As posing as cops
[1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:43.360]  Why they identify as a cop?
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  There you go, I identify as a mask
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:47.360]  There you go
[1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:50.360]  Second, I want to say you asked specifically
[1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:53.360]  How does it feel to be alive during this?
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  And I will say that thanks to you and Dr. Zelenko
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:59.360]  It feels absolutely amazing
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:01.360]  The gift and a blessing
[1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:03.360]  So thank you for that
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:05.360]  You're right Coco, as bad as this is
[1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  It's a blessing to know the truth
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:09.360]  And know where you are in history
[1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.360]  And couldn't find a better hill to die on
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:13.360]  Than the freedoms of this country
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:16.360]  There's a reason we're here now
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.360]  And it's beautiful
[1:40:18.360 --> 1:40:20.360]  What do you think is coming Coco?
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:23.360]  I think, well, everything you guys say
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:25.360]  I mean, I've done my own research
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:27.360]  I've done quite a bit of research
[1:40:27.360 --> 1:40:31.360]  And I do believe the famine
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:35.360]  I honestly don't think that
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:38.360]  I think that I am so fortunate
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:41.360]  That this is my, you know, my hill to die on
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:43.360]  I feel that, that is
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:46.360]  Oh yeah, we're going to die on it one way or the other
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:48.360]  They're coming to kill us, exactly
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:50.360]  I'll introduce fight back, God bless you Coco
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:53.360]  Let's take a caller now from Washington State
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  Brian on the west coast, thank you for calling
[1:40:56.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  Hey Alex
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:00.360]  Good to talk to you
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  So, can you hear me okay?
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  Yes sir, thanks for calling
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  Okay Alex, I want to tell
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360]  I've told all of this too
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.360]  And I just want to say man
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  Being able to listen to your show
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  And some of your guests that you have on
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:16.360]  And some of these people that are so influential
[1:41:16.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  And educating people on
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  mRNA vaccines
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  And understanding our immune system
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:24.360]  I mean, it's so powerful
[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:26.360]  I like to liken you to
[1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  Like a modern age on the Baptist, right?
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:31.360]  I mean, our society is totally collapsing
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  And you and your guests
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  Are putting up such powerful information
[1:41:36.360 --> 1:41:38.360]  On how to protect ourselves and protect our families
[1:41:38.360 --> 1:41:40.360]  That it's Sunday
[1:41:40.360 --> 1:41:42.360]  Sunday shows for me
[1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:44.360]  It really helps me ground myself
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:46.360]  Me too, the listeners
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:48.360]  The callers, the guests
[1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360]  We're in the same boat brother
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.360]  And the thing is they want us to think we're alone
[1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:54.360]  We're not alone
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.360]  Actually almost a majority of people
[1:41:56.360 --> 1:41:58.360]  Are with us, we just don't have a way to connect
[1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.360]  Right, right, exactly
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:02.360]  You know, you asked this question
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:04.360]  Last week or so
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:06.360]  About what's the next
[1:42:06.360 --> 1:42:08.360]  What's the next steps that these
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  This transgender with the
[1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:12.360]  The sex, basically the sex offenders
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:14.360]  What direction do they want to go with
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:16.360]  Our kids like put, you know, run around
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:18.360]  Naked in front of kids at these parades and things
[1:42:18.360 --> 1:42:20.360]  I think the next step is actually
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:22.360]  You look at other of these other countries
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:24.360]  That the globalist corporate global
[1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:26.360]  Operations have taken control of
[1:42:26.360 --> 1:42:28.360]  I think they're going to push it to
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.360]  I mean, as far as all the chaos that we already see
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:32.360]  I think the next step with kids
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:34.360]  Is pushing them into child prostitution
[1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:36.360]  And having that be open and normalized
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:38.360]  Right
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:40.360]  No, I think you're right
[1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:42.360]  I mean, I mean, I mean, that's it
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.360]  They teach in the public schools
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:46.360]  In fifth grade and sixth grade
[1:42:46.360 --> 1:42:48.360]  That the sex worker is what you should be
[1:42:48.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  We're not the second sex workers
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:52.360]  We're trying to put them into that highly abusive situation
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.360]  Ryan, I love you
[1:42:54.360 --> 1:42:56.360]  Mike, Lee, Gilbert, Vinnie, Mark
[1:42:56.360 --> 1:43:18.360]  To all your calls
[1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:28.360]  So please take action to declare independence
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:30.360]  From the New World Order
[1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  By keeping the tip of the spear on air

[1:43:50.360 --> 1:43:52.360]  Against the New World Order
[1:43:52.360 --> 1:43:54.360]  Because the answer to 1984
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:56.360]  1776
[1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.360]  What are champions made of?

[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:33.760]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:37.560]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where
[1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:42.240]  they belong and dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  Well I think...
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:47.040]  NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:49.360]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health scare.
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:51.760]  A new disease.
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:52.760]  No one's immune.
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:56.480]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic and instead
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:47:59.520]  of summer, it's all the time.
[1:47:59.520 --> 1:48:02.680]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:04.560]  He loves being that guy.
[1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:07.120]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:09.080]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:13.600]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:17.400]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:19.400]  Get over here NBC.
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:23.840]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I...
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:24.840]  Oh.
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:25.840]  Wow.
[1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:26.840]  Wow.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:27.840]  Oh yeah.
[1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:30.240]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:35.480]  No, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:38.200]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[1:48:38.200 --> 1:48:40.520]  House cat flu is coming, people.
[1:48:40.520 --> 1:48:44.040]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house
[1:48:44.040 --> 1:48:48.640]  cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:54.840]  So, better beware, that warm body on your left just might be ready to destroy your tender
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:55.840]  fiddles.
[1:48:55.840 --> 1:49:01.960]  Well, we sit here.
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:05.480]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:06.640]  the following symptoms.
[1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:10.920]  Mild, thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[1:49:10.920 --> 1:49:13.640]  So we sit here calmly talking about this.
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.120]  Millions of six-month-olds are being injected by their brainwashed parents with something
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:24.800]  that erases their immune system and plants, cancer-causing prions in their body.
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:26.600]  That's the year 2022.
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:27.720]  That's just where we are.
[1:49:27.720 --> 1:49:30.600]  They think you're too weak-minded or I'm too weak-minded to face it.
[1:49:30.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  No, we're not.
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:32.600]  They'll be brought to justice.
[1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  All right.
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  We're taking your phone calls right now, and the caller I was about to go to, Dustin in
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:42.240]  Florida, is there.
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.240]  Dustin in Florida, truck driver, says people don't understand what's going on, but you
[1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:47.240]  see it.
[1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.240]  There's a supply chain.
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:49.240]  Tell us what you're saying.
[1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:55.440]  Yeah, I just wanted to say I believe you will go down as one of the most important people
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:50:01.320]  in history, and people just don't understand the caliber of what's happening right now
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:03.480]  until it's right in our face.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:07.360]  And it's just so important you try to get the word out there.
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:08.840]  I drive truck.
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:10.480]  I ride it on the side of my truck.
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:11.800]  I got a flag.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:14.280]  You know, we have to wait as many people up.
[1:50:14.280 --> 1:50:20.600]  I got a Bluetooth speaker, I go into the truck stops with an episode of you playing.
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:24.080]  Every time I go into the truck stop trying to wake people up, all I can do is put the
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:25.080]  information out there.
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:29.440]  Hopefully they listen, and I give out the website everywhere I go.
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:32.160]  By the way, Dustin, it's not all you're doing.
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:36.440]  Grassroots communication is the most powerful form.
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:40.320]  If small people, you're not small, but that's how they see you, activate and spread the
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:41.320]  word.
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:42.320]  It's a chain reaction.
[1:50:42.320 --> 1:50:43.320]  Nothing can stop you.
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  Absolutely.
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:48.800]  And all the humans have ingrained in them, hey, hey, pass it on.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:49.800]  We haven't ingrained.
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:51.120]  You got to say, hey, it's forbidden.
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:52.120]  Here it is.
[1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:53.920]  And then tell others, and then they do it.
[1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:58.360]  And people innately already know that, even if they're unconscious, it activates something.
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:50:59.360]  You understand?
[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:00.360]  Absolutely.
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:01.360]  Yes.
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:05.840]  And people really do, when they hear your voice, they go, hey, isn't that?
[1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:10.280]  And I go, yeah, Alex Jones listens to him, and he is on point, knows what he's talking
[1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:11.280]  about.
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:13.800]  He doesn't want to be protected at all costs.
[1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:16.560]  He will go down as one of the most important people in America.
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:20.280]  Well, brother, I appreciate that, but protect this transmission at all costs.
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:23.880]  I don't care what happens to me, but I am wracked with trying to keep us on air.
[1:51:23.880 --> 1:51:25.640]  We are so close to being shut down.
[1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:28.320]  So thank you for your word of mouth, and we God bless you, Dustin.
[1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:29.520]  Call me back again this week.
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:30.520]  I love you.
[1:51:30.520 --> 1:51:31.520]  All right.
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:32.520]  Get to everybody here.
[1:51:32.520 --> 1:51:34.320]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:37.200]  Mark in Illinois on the Georgia Guidestones, they got blown up Monday.
[1:51:37.200 --> 1:51:38.200]  Go ahead.
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:39.840]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[1:51:39.840 --> 1:51:40.840]  It's a real honor.
[1:51:40.840 --> 1:51:42.160]  I want to go real fast.
[1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:47.280]  First thing, if you watch the video of the Georgia Guidestones exploding, they say 4AM,
[1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:48.800]  but it's more specific.
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:52.800]  The clock on the camera says 4033.
[1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:54.600]  And I don't think that's a mistake.
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:55.800]  I don't think that's a mistake.
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:58.760]  I think they're taking down the first B system to install the next.
[1:51:58.760 --> 1:52:00.840]  I don't leave that right there.
[1:52:00.840 --> 1:52:05.440]  What I want to really want to say was this is, could be the most important message from
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:07.800]  a caller you've ever had.
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:13.960]  Every single listener right now needs to stop spending money at big tech, streaming services,
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:16.960]  entertainment, and especially their cable bills.
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:17.960]  Cancel them.
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:18.960]  Now.
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:22.600]  Take 20% of the money you just saved and make a recurring donation.
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:23.760]  We're past buying products.
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:24.760]  Buy the products.
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:25.760]  Absolutely.
[1:52:25.760 --> 1:52:26.760]  I have every single one of them.
[1:52:26.760 --> 1:52:29.080]  Everybody needs to make a donation right now.
[1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:34.440]  You once said, that's the real power attack, followed by one of your infamous battle cries.
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:37.120]  Well, I'm going to change it a little bit.
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:39.800]  According to the info war, that's the real power.
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:44.440]  Brother, I totally agree with you and you got to go to infowarstore.com and do the support
[1:52:44.440 --> 1:52:45.440]  thing and find the link.
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:49.720]  We're going to start adding the donate link under every live show feed because I swear
[1:52:49.720 --> 1:52:50.720]  on my children.
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:54.440]  We're totally maxed out and we are so close to being shut down or imploding.
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:58.600]  So God bless you and I appreciate you, brother, anything else, Mark?
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:52:59.600]  That's it, Alex.
[1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:00.600]  Thanks so much for what you're doing.
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:01.600]  Keep up the great work.
[1:53:01.600 --> 1:53:03.400]  You are the tip of the spear.
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:04.400]  Thank you, sir.
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:06.160]  I'll just say this.
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:13.600]  I think God strike me down if I'm not absolutely totally maxed out and have not spent almost
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:14.920]  all the funds I've got.
[1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:17.160]  I barely have any backup funds and I'm not bitching.
[1:53:17.160 --> 1:53:18.160]  I believe in God.
[1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:21.000]  I know God's real and maybe I'm supposed to be taking out of the fight right now, but
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.360]  I need support infowarstore.com.
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:24.360]  You need support.
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:25.360]  We love you.
[1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  We appreciate you.
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:29.400]  Let's go to Lee in Pennsylvania's next up.
[1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:30.400]  Lee.
[1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:31.400]  Thanks for holding.
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:32.400]  Go ahead, Lee.
[1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:33.400]  Hi, Alex.
[1:53:33.400 --> 1:53:36.400]  It's a pleasure to finally talk to you.
[1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:37.400]  Yes, sir.
[1:53:37.400 --> 1:53:38.400]  Thank you.
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:42.200]  I wanted to talk to you about on whatever you were on Blair White's podcast.
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:47.320]  I remember you saying you felt really white-pilled about the future, but on your show on July
[1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:53.360]  7th, you seemed rather, you know, not so happy, not so looking forward to what's coming.
[1:53:53.360 --> 1:53:57.760]  You're saying that sometimes we may not have 10 more years even.
[1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:02.920]  So I was just wondering, like right now, how, how what's your overall feelings towards
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:03.920]  this?
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:04.920]  That's a great question.
[1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:09.000]  You know, I don't get orders from anybody except God and I, and I, I feel optimistic
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  some days.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.120]  I don't other days because we're winning overall.
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:13.280]  People are waking up.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:15.920]  And so in the end, I feel white-pilled.
[1:54:15.920 --> 1:54:18.040]  Currently I feel black-pilled, very desperate.
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:21.600]  So I think, I think currently the flesh feels black-pilled.
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:22.920]  The spirit feels white-pilled.
[1:54:22.920 --> 1:54:23.920]  Does that make sense?
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:25.920]  Oh, it makes total sense.
[1:54:25.920 --> 1:54:27.920]  I mean, that's, I always go back and forth.
[1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:29.920]  I mean, it's, I always try to stay white-pilled.
[1:54:29.920 --> 1:54:32.000]  I always try to, you know, listen to you.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.600]  I really thought about God a lot more and stuff like that.
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:38.880]  Um, the only thing I wanted to ask you about was, you know, I'm in my early 20s.
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:42.040]  I have a girlfriend I want to get married to in a couple of years, but hearing about
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:46.680]  all of this control and how the globalists come out to keep what you love, I'm just curious
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:51.160]  like, what do you think for someone in my shoes right now is the best course of action?
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:54.680]  Brother keep loving, get a wife, have children, bet on life.
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:55:00.160]  That's the biggest double down there is and, and, and, and just don't give up.
[1:55:00.160 --> 1:55:01.760]  Don't let them shut you down.
[1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:02.760]  Don't make them.
[1:55:02.760 --> 1:55:03.760]  Let you become depressed.
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:07.880]  When I tell you that, I'm giving myself that advice when I point my finger at you, Lee,
[1:55:07.880 --> 1:55:09.360]  it's back at me three fingers, man.
[1:55:09.360 --> 1:55:12.120]  I have just got to realize it's God's plan.
[1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:13.120]  It's a larger operation.
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:15.840]  I've just got to be a good person by as hard as I can.
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:16.840]  I appreciate you.
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:17.840]  God bless you.
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:18.840]  Incredible calls.
[1:55:18.840 --> 1:55:19.840]  These are incredible calls.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:20.840]  It's very incredible.
[1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:21.840]  And I feel so bad.
[1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:26.440]  We got three minutes left and we got like a bunch of calls left, but I'll go to the
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:27.440]  order they're received.
[1:55:27.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  Mike in Colorado.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:29.440]  Go ahead, Mike.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.000]  Yeah, hey, Alex, a pleasure to speak with you.
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  This is great.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:39.720]  I am my legal immigrant from 1970s Poland and I know exactly what it means to have one
[1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:44.720]  tank of gas a month when you're given a coupon from the government.
[1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:51.360]  And in fact, I remember my uncle siphoning gas out of his car to get us out.
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:52.520]  And again, you're from Poland.
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:53.520]  It's on record.
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:54.920]  They used it to control you.
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:58.720]  Well, how great the Polish people are, how much they love freedom.
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:55:59.720]  Exactly.
[1:55:59.720 --> 1:56:00.720]  Exactly.
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:05.360]  And I first heard you on 9-11 and a buddy of mine was like, listen to this guy.
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:09.040]  He's got a different point of view and it's very, very interesting that I've been listening
[1:56:09.040 --> 1:56:10.040]  ever since.
[1:56:10.040 --> 1:56:16.520]  This is my first call and, you know, fast forward a few decades and I'm in a global
[1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:23.920]  fuel logistics company and it's amazing to see the shortages that are coming with distribution
[1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:27.080]  of jet fuel and fuel for ships.
[1:56:27.080 --> 1:56:32.440]  We used to get some messages that, you know, there would be restrictions, you know, after
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:37.720]  hurricanes and now it's like, it's coming in weekly and if you think there's delays
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:46.000]  bad right now with airlines and other logistics, I think it's going to get a lot worse, unfortunately.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.640]  Mike, I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:49.640]  And I said I'd do it.
[1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:50.640]  We've been busy.
[1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:51.640]  I haven't done it.
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:57.000]  We're going to start three nights a week doing nothing but calls with no breaks.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.040]  And by the way, we're going to give the number out.
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:02.680]  Owen's about to take over for two hours and he's going to take your calls.
[1:57:02.680 --> 1:57:06.880]  So Vinny and Gilbert and Mike, he wants to talk to you.
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:08.360]  Don't hang up Mike in Colorado.
[1:57:08.360 --> 1:57:12.080]  Owen Schreuer is going to go right to you when he starts the next two hours, only six
[1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:14.360]  minutes an hour in Sunday Live.
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:15.360]  We've cut the network ads.
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:17.400]  They're only local ads for local stations.
[1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:18.680]  So don't hang up.
[1:57:18.680 --> 1:57:32.360]  Goal free number to join us, 877-789-2539, the Cavalry's coming.
[1:57:32.360 --> 1:57:36.600]  Next broadcast coming up, Straight Ahead, it's going to get a lot worse folks, there may
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.600]  be nuclear war.
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:39.960]  Get right with God now before it's too late.
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:48.120]  Owen Schreuer and Sunday Live, Straight Ahead, your call, Straight Ahead, stay with us.

[1:58:41.600 --> 1:58:48.360]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:49.720]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:58:49.720 --> 1:58:51.680]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:58:51.680 --> 1:58:52.680]  Welcome.
[1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:53.680]  Hello, Alex.
[1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:54.680]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:58:54.680 --> 1:58:55.680]  All right.
[1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:57.680]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:02.640]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMail
[1:59:02.640 --> 1:59:05.400]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:06.400]  Mix those two together.
[1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:08.040]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:09.960]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:16.120]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:21.320]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as
[1:59:21.320 --> 1:59:22.320]  strong.
[1:59:22.320 --> 1:59:23.320]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:25.880]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:59:25.880 --> 1:59:27.880]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:59:27.880 --> 1:59:31.360]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[1:59:31.360 --> 1:59:32.360]  That's just how it is.
[1:59:32.360 --> 1:59:33.880]  It's how it works.
[1:59:33.880 --> 1:59:35.520]  So it's always good.
[1:59:35.520 --> 1:59:37.640]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:55.400]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
