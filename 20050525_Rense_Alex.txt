[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:05.900]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's liquid quell. Doctor recommend
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:25.900]  Okay, right back with Alex Jones. There was so much in the production, Alex. So much of it ugly. It's, it just, it was appalling to me. I just, and the size of the demonstration that was completely obliterated, obscured, ignored by the audience.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:55.900]  Well, Jeff, I went up in the Empire State Building at one time on that first day, that Sunday when it kicked off. And there were, as I described on your program, about five streets wide, some of the trails going back over a mile. Local news said 400 plus thousand at one time. Easily that amount.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:15.900]  National news said 100,000, and would only focus on the freaks who were few and far between. They weren't the, I mean, even the minority of people, but, but that's what the media did. They would focus on right wing and left wing kooks and idiots to try to marginalize the people that were there. There were a lot of families there, a lot of really angry people. And also, they were trying to get the attention of the media.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:51.900]  So national news kept saying how much New Yorkers loved it. Literally 95% of New Yorkers we talked to, even who were Republicans, thought it was horrible to bring it there and to use 9-11 as a poster child for more of a police state. But talking to taxi drivers, and we interview them in the film, briefly at the first, we go, how many people were in the city? And they say between 80 and 90% had left. And I've been to New York a few times and never seen it that empty.
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:59.900]  I mean, you'd have 5, 10 cabs, no exaggeration, pulling up at once, trying to pick you up.
[00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.900]  Well, the point was made quite clear. It was amazing.
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:31.900]  But the majority of the film, again, the heart of the film is 9-11, as you saw. And we lay it out. I mean, we go A to Z, the evidence of prior knowledge, the evidence of involvement, the evidence of the cover up. We go right through it, and then we start talking to locals, and all the people who heard it on the radio when they said they were going to blow up Building 7, all the firefighters that were told to get out of the building, all the police, people who were told don't go to work that day.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:41.900]  I mean, it's not just the Zogby poll showing people think the government's involved. It's not just the CNN poll. It's not just all that. Then we show the people on the street saying the same thing.
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.900]  Total, total corroboration.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:16:04.900]  Well, I really appreciate your kind words about the film. It is my best film. It dwarfs my other videos. I spent more time on it. I spent a month before I left. I spent 5, 6 months when I got back making the film, and I really do hope that people will get a copy of it. I hope they will make copies of it, because all I want to do is get this out to people.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:22.900]  Well, again, I would urge you to address it as three documentaries in one. The panorama of it is enormous, and folks, for those of you who really like Alex Jones, and there are millions of you, if you haven't seen him in video before, you're going to love it.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:51.900]  You get to spend two and a half, three hours with Alex Jones. I'm serious. It's like you're right in the house, in the room, because your ability to project your passion, your sincerity, your spontaneity, and your enormous intellectual grasp of what's happening, and to put it into simple terms, not simple-minded, but simple terms, to show people, and then you back it up with what's in the documentary. I've not seen anything like it. It's just an enormous achievement, and I really commend you.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:17:17.900]  Well, I appreciate it, Jeff. Since you started the broadcast with a plug, people can go to infowars.com or prismplanet.com via the SafeSecure shopping cart, and order a VHS or DVD, and they can also call toll-free to get one at 1-888-253-3139, or they go to prismplanet.tv.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:34.900]  15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, all 12 of my films in high bandwidth and low bandwidth, my book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of my weekly TV shows, every week they're posted, all my best audio interviews, interview with you. We're kind enough to come on last Wednesday for an hour and a half.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.900]  You're welcome. I'm the world's worst guest, but you put up with it.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:42.900]  No, that's ridiculous. People are begging for you to come back, and it's all there at prismplanet.tv.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:18:09.900]  Well, please, for what it's worth, all of you, I think, listening, I can say safely, are repulsed by talking heads. You get these phony pretty boys, pretty girls out in the field, whatever, anchorman, anchorwomen, and they've got their little notes, or they've got their little traveling teleprompter, and they're looking right in the camera, right at you, but they're reading on a screen you can't see, and they're just reading a script that they've written, or that has been written for them by a producer.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:19.900]  Alex Jones speaks to you from his mind and his heart. It is all extemporaneous, it is not rehearsed, it is off the top of his head, just like you hear it now.
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:47.900]  And for me, a 12-year veteran of television news and television production, as an anchorman news director, to see somebody that gifted, and that caring about what he is doing, or she may be doing, to deliver it like that was enormously, it gave me a great deal of hope that there's still honest people out there who will sit down and talk to you, man to man, man to woman, straight to your face, without rehearsal, without notes, without any of the other crap.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.900]  Alex knows his stuff.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.900]  Wow, well please, you've got to stop, Jeff, but, I mean, all I did basically...
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.900]  I'm telling you the truth, Alex, listen, I'm not BSing anybody.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:03.900]  Oh, no, no, no, I mean, it's very nice of you. I mean, all I did was, as I said earlier, organically go show people what was happening...
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900]  You did.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:13.900]  ...talk to the people, and that's what I don't think they get, Jeff, is that, you know, being a talk radio, we really are, you know, going with what we believe and the evidence we have.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:18.900]  With TV, if you watch 60 seconds, it might be an hour of crafting.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900]  Correct.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.900]  And it looks like it's so sincere and so real, and they practice and go to school.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.900]  That's why I walked away from it. It's a fraud.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:33.900]  They did so much work to project this genuineness, but, frankly, the people are seeing through it.
[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:39.900]  That's why Rents.com gets millions and millions and millions of visitors each month, because they want that sincerity.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.900]  And, sincerely, folks, it's not just our sincerity. Then we back it up with all the facts.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.900]  It's all there.
[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:54.900]  And, yes, it's a very dark film. It's a very scary film. It's a very painful film, but it's better to know the facts than to not know them, and so, in a way, it's healing.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:00.900]  Always said the same thing. I'd rather know than not to know, no matter how bad the news is. Thank you.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:08.900]  And for those of you who don't want to know, that's fine, too, but we're here to tell you that it's a different world than the mainstream hacks and liars and phonies would have you believe.
[00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.900]  Back in just a minute with Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:24.900]  I've got to tell you, there's something that just came across my desk. Scientific American. You know, it's a legendary magazine.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.900]  It's got a pretty good reputation, a staunch supporter of good science, reasonable science, sometimes excellent articles.
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:39.900]  Well, there's a guy who's written an article on Scientific American, Michael Shermer. Remember that name?
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:51.900]  If I'm not mistaken, he was on this program once, and right in the middle of his presentation, completely dissed Roswell and said it was a fraud and nothing ever happened there, and I was rather speechless.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:58.900]  But anyway, he's got an article on Scientific American. Here's a quote from it. You're going to like this one.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:20.900]  The mistaken belief that a handful, a handful, you know, two or three, of unexplained anomalies can undermine a well-established theory lies at the heart of all conspiratorial thinking, as well as creationism, Holocaust denial, and the various crank theories of physics.
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:29.900]  All the evidence for a 9-11 conspiracy falls under the rubric of this fallacy.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:37.900]  This is an article on Scientific American, the June issue. Let me just read a little bit more here, see if this rings a bell, Alex.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:46.900]  Noted French left-wing activist Thierry Meissand's 9-11 Conspiracy Book, a bestseller in 2002.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:23:13.900]  But I never imagined such an appalling deception would ever find a voice in America. At a recent public lecture, I was button-holed by a Michael Moore wannabe filmmaker who breathlessly explained that 9-11 was orchestrated by Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the Central Intelligence Agency as part of their plan for global domination and a new world order.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:22.900]  Sound familiar? It wasn't you, but somebody else apparently trying to make a dent in this guy and explain to him that, hey, you're wrong.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.900]  Well...
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:31.900]  But Scientific American, like Popular Mechanics and so forth, coming out foursquare as basically hardcore mainstream government...
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.900]  Well, I don't hear any science there, Jeff. I don't hear any facts there.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:43.900]  I'm wondering what it's doing in this magazine, but I don't wonder for long because they're all used as a platform for government disinformation.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:55.900]  Well, look, they've tried to ignore us for three and a half years. Now they're panicking because, again, you have a CNN poll, 90% of Americans believe the government had prior knowledge and allowed it to happen, Zogby poll, 50%.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:09.900]  They're panicking. They know that the rabbit's out of the bag, the trick has been exposed, and I would just say to him, okay, sir, we have 600 pieces of evidence. Let's go over them.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:22.900]  Did you know that NORAD was ordered to stand down by Dick Cheney? Here's the admission. Did you know three months before they took the power from the generals to shoot down planes that they'd had since NORAD was set up and gave it over to only Dick Cheney?
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900]  Yep.
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.900]  Did you know that public officials were warned not to fly the night before?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:31.900]  Many, by the way, many of them, not just Willie Brown, many others.
[00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.900]  Colin Rush, Dee Ashcroft, the list goes on and on.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900]  That's right, that's right.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:46.900]  The Joint Chiefs of Staff, I would say, did you know that there were CIA drills of flying hijacked jets to the World Trade Center and Pentagon at the exact same time that morning? Now, use your science. What is the probability...
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.900]  He didn't want to hear it.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:25:02.900]  That there'd be a drill of the exact same thing happening at the exact same time on the exact same day. What about the CIA insider training? What about PNAC? Dick Cheney's saying we need helpful Pearl Harbor events to mobilize the people behind a war for global domination.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:13.900]  That Saddam isn't a threat, but he's got the oil that will tell the people he's a threat. Dick Cheney wrote this in September of 2000, rebuilding America's defenses, a published white paper by PNAC.
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:28.900]  And I would go on over the rest of the 590-something points. Listen, I was on the radio last night on a syndicated show for two hours with this counterterrorism expert from the Pentagon.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:48.900]  And by the end of it, he was basically crying. All he had was emotion. I had totally cleaned his clock. Every caller but one agreed with me. He was totally panicking. I would go over facts and evidence. I would say, what about Operation Northwoods, the official U.S. government plan to carry out 9-11?
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900]  Did he even admit that he ever heard of it?
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:26:10.900]  No, he didn't know anything. That's the point is that, look, folks, we are using science. We are using the facts. I wish this wasn't true. But look, all the evidence aside, motive, they would always ask in Roman times, and I cover this in the films, kimono.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:20.900]  Or who stands? Who profits? Who gains? Who has a motive? Who gets trillions in oil? Who gets hundreds of billions in weapons sales? Who gets to invade all these countries for their oil?
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:29.900]  Who gets to be politically popular as a savior here in America? Who gets to set up a police state? Who gets to set up an empire? And it's not just that we know that's the motive.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:42.900]  These bastards say it in PNAC. They say it in other white papers. They say it in Naval War College documents. They say it all over the place because they have to communicate with each other.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:52.900]  And then he tried to say this, Jeff, the classic statement. Well, Mr. Jones, they couldn't keep something this big, that secret. Are you saying the whole government's involved?
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:27:13.900]  And I said, no, a tiny cell group is involved. And then he said, well, they still couldn't keep it secret. And I said, like they kept secret for 60 years, starting in the 30s, going through the 1980s, of sterilizing 400,000 plus women and men, 33,000 of them, that's even ABC News, in secret.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:28.900]  You're going to have a baby and they sterilize you. Now, black men and just taking with syphilis, 13 plus 100, high altitude, chemical, biological, radiological tests, projects shared for 30 years, killing U.S. groups, spraying stuff on them.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:35.900]  It's ridiculous, of course. That's what the national security apparatus and national security state is all about.
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:48.900]  It's about keeping everything secret and controlling information. And then all these people go public, all these FBI agents, all these agents in government, all these prominent people, David Shippers, Larry Klayman, Robert Wright, they all go public.
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:59.900]  W199I gets released where Bush ordered the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda. Bush lies and says we never heard of plans to fly planes into buildings. And it turns out they have a specific memo saying the exact thing.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:11.900]  Two days before 9-11, he signs the launch order to invade Afghanistan with our troops massing to invade. On and on, flying 8,000 Taliban and Al Qaeda out to safety in the middle of the war.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:23.900]  Lying to us about private lunch, lying to us about Pat Tillman, lying to us about weapons of mass destruction, lying to us about everything. I'm sorry.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:36.900]  No, it's true. If that guy ever dares go on the radio again, I'll be surprised, especially with anybody who wants to argue with him. He just cleaned his clock. I mean, you reduced him to a quivering jello bowl and that was it.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.900]  After the first 30 minutes, he stopped talking.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:47.900]  No, I wouldn't be surprised. Surprised he didn't excuse himself and leave. Hold on. We'll be right back.
