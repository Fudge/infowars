[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:35.480]  Texas Alex Jones I am from the world I'm gonna have a live update throughout the
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.260]  broadcast day we have been staying a bunch of other powerful interviews we've
[00:40.260 --> 00:44.580]  done in the last few weeks coming up today but I'll also be popping in some
[00:44.580 --> 00:50.580]  live today I have been gone out of town so much working so much finishing fall
[00:50.580 --> 00:54.180]  the Republic I was intending to spend a little bit of time with my family I've
[00:54.180 --> 00:58.820]  been having to stay up on the news and the plunging of the dollar and gold in
[00:58.820 --> 01:03.180]  an all-time record high so I wanted people right here at the start of the
[01:03.180 --> 01:08.580]  show to have an opportunity because these opportunities don't grow on trees
[01:08.580 --> 01:13.100]  and he's come along every once in a while to be locked in to be guaranteed
[01:13.100 --> 01:17.660]  to have immediate profit we're dead bought gold at the 994 level and now
[01:17.660 --> 01:25.980]  it's at $1,057 today and climbing that's 20 something almost 30 something
[01:25.980 --> 01:33.140]  dollars over the previous record of $1,030 and 80 cents I wanted to bring
[01:33.140 --> 01:37.660]  kind of briefly here right at the top of the show because I did ran out of gold
[01:37.660 --> 01:41.580]  at the 991 level now he's the 994 level he's gonna ride on that very very soon
[01:41.580 --> 01:46.340]  same with silver he's got an even lower level and you know Ted's basically
[01:46.340 --> 01:49.820]  losing money at this price but we only do this when this stuff is super hot
[01:49.820 --> 01:53.380]  because people only pay attention when it's super hot but the point is you can
[01:53.380 --> 01:57.500]  go back in a time machine and buy gold and silver at a price you can't buy
[01:57.500 --> 02:01.460]  anywhere else I mean I dare you to try to find it anywhere else this is
[02:01.460 --> 02:06.060]  insanely low tell us what you got today what's happening with gold yeah I'll be
[02:06.060 --> 02:09.540]  happy to tell you what's going on the market is just crazily hot I mean I
[02:09.540 --> 02:14.820]  haven't had time to adjust prices yet and right now gold right now was sitting
[02:14.820 --> 02:24.380]  at 1,057.60 has seen a high day of 1,059.60 silver is almost $18
[02:24.380 --> 02:30.260]  an ounce now 1788 the dollar right now is dropping I mean dropping hard it's not
[02:30.260 --> 02:35.180]  dropping just a small amount there was a lot of news that came out to try to try
[02:35.180 --> 02:38.180]  to counter what happened in the Middle East when they said that they were
[02:38.180 --> 02:42.900]  getting together with Russia and China to change the way that they price oil
[02:42.900 --> 02:47.180]  the dollar is under attack right now it's being under its attack being
[02:47.180 --> 02:51.460]  attacked by foreigners they're you know basically they're trying to win back
[02:51.460 --> 02:57.420]  control and and have the United States lose its its its power grab here with
[02:57.420 --> 03:04.460]  the with the with the currency being the the world currency regardless of what
[03:04.460 --> 03:09.140]  happens here and we hope the dollars stay strong unfortunately they've issued
[03:09.140 --> 03:13.140]  hundreds and hundreds of trillions of dollars of fiat currency over the last
[03:13.140 --> 03:17.700]  20 years they're accelerating that it's well over 28 trillion last number we
[03:17.700 --> 03:25.940]  got was 20 24.7 or 23.7 the point is is that all of this is happening that the
[03:25.940 --> 03:29.340]  globalists are devaluing the dollar the media is trying to blame us with Chinese
[03:29.340 --> 03:32.820]  and the Russians and they're certainly not angels the point is they see the
[03:32.820 --> 03:36.980]  globalists killing the dollar themselves so they're saying okay with this new
[03:36.980 --> 03:40.860]  world order being born how do we position ourselves the citizens of
[03:40.860 --> 03:44.940]  America and Canada the listeners of this show and listeners worldwide should be
[03:44.940 --> 03:49.220]  asking how do they position themselves and the safe haven is gold and silver
[03:49.220 --> 03:53.300]  and everywhere else they've got huge premiums on it because of the gold rush
[03:53.300 --> 03:57.540]  the deal here it's like everybody else is selling cabbage batch dolls at 200 bucks
[03:57.540 --> 04:03.660]  right now it's got them at 50 give Ted Anderson and the brokers a call 800 686
[04:03.660 --> 04:11.220]  2237 800 686 2237 the brokers are there Ted am I right to say you still have gold
[04:11.220 --> 04:16.500]  in the market you bought the 994 level I'm offering the same prices as I did
[04:16.500 --> 04:20.980]  yesterday yet gold went up another $10 so yes indeed if you're interested in
[04:20.980 --> 04:24.900]  buying gold and silver at this particular time at this moment you can take
[04:24.900 --> 04:29.660]  advantage of a great offer from Midas resources but I mean just take a look at
[04:29.660 --> 04:33.540]  what's going on in the economy you should be buying gold we do have a great
[04:33.540 --> 04:36.860]  buy here but at least get into the marketplace whether if you're gonna buy
[04:36.860 --> 04:44.340]  it from us or not I don't care 800 800 686 2237 give them a call don't be stupid
[04:44.340 --> 04:55.620]  folks Bernadette live I think throughout the transmission on the fate of the dollar

[08:19.380 --> 08:30.220]  Austin Texas Alex Jones world government is openly being announced and
[08:30.220 --> 08:34.460]  formed in front of our very eyes Barack Obama has engaged in high treason and
[08:34.460 --> 08:38.940]  become the first US president the chair of the UN Security Council the UN
[08:38.940 --> 08:42.300]  Security Council is the most powerful body the only body with real power in
[08:42.300 --> 08:49.500]  the UN the Secretary General chairs the General Assembly of all the different
[08:49.500 --> 08:56.060]  third-world countries that have no power only the G20 finance ministers have
[08:56.060 --> 09:00.980]  the real power in the governmental systems of the nation states but the
[09:00.980 --> 09:06.620]  Security Council and its rotating 15 member board is the true power in the
[09:06.620 --> 09:15.060]  United Nations and President Obama has violated article one section 9 of the
[09:15.060 --> 09:21.580]  US Constitution taking his seat on the rotating board every 15 months he is
[09:21.580 --> 09:26.300]  now saying he will chair it for the month-long duration of the month-long
[09:26.300 --> 09:31.060]  term and he has to swear an oath to the UN Charter to do that that is in
[09:31.060 --> 09:35.140]  complete contravention to our bill of rights our Constitution the Declaration
[09:35.140 --> 09:39.580]  of Independence and his oath of office we're going to be discussing that I
[09:39.580 --> 09:49.260]  have a huge stack of news here today where they are openly announcing world
[09:49.260 --> 09:57.740]  government the new world order just absolutely amazing we have Israel saying
[09:57.740 --> 10:01.140]  they're getting ready to hit Iran we see media hype and propaganda about how they
[10:01.140 --> 10:06.700]  have hidden nukes and hidden facilities we're seeing a complete replay of 2002
[10:06.700 --> 10:13.340]  into 2003 with a strike six and a half years ago on Iraq we have military
[10:13.340 --> 10:18.060]  police kidnapping G20 protesters not just one but one on video but other
[10:18.060 --> 10:22.100]  confirmed reports anyone that even spoke out against it or videotaped it was
[10:22.100 --> 10:27.780]  then arrested by riot police and drug away this is right out of malice china or
[10:27.780 --> 10:36.180]  soviet Russia and then we have the newspaper revitalization act with the
[10:36.180 --> 10:39.940]  rock Obama saying he wants it to pass to federalize the major newspapers
[10:39.940 --> 10:43.660]  openly a violation of the First Amendment they're taking over the
[10:43.660 --> 10:46.580]  churches to the faith-based initiatives and the clergy response teams are taking
[10:46.580 --> 10:49.660]  over the newspapers they're taking over the auto industry they're taking over
[10:49.660 --> 10:53.980]  the banking industry there they want to take over health care 20% of what's
[10:53.980 --> 10:58.020]  left of the economy you think the insurance companies and hospitals do a
[10:58.020 --> 11:03.180]  sorry job sometimes there they're angels compared to the government that's why
[11:03.180 --> 11:06.100]  the insurance companies are actually lobbying in many cases for this
[11:06.100 --> 11:10.180]  government takeover because then they're gonna have liability protection so
[11:10.180 --> 11:28.780]  that is all coming up today as well I also want to get into the fact that
[11:28.780 --> 11:35.300]  these bomb plots in Dallas and in Illinois are classically staged to
[11:35.300 --> 11:45.140]  hype all this Iran fear we are also going to get into this piece of
[11:45.140 --> 11:51.740]  propaganda spanking lowers the child's IQ researchers say and we have caught
[11:51.740 --> 11:55.220]  these different government researchers and university researchers will remember
[11:55.220 --> 12:04.580]  the five years ago a big Illinois Chicago study came out saying that the
[12:04.580 --> 12:11.060]  founding fathers didn't like guns and only 10% of the colonists own guns and
[12:11.060 --> 12:17.180]  then other researchers like John Lott the professor went and researched it and
[12:17.180 --> 12:23.100]  found it was all a lie and the professor was disbarred there needs to be an
[12:23.100 --> 12:29.340]  investigation of this study because I'll guarantee you that the higher IQ
[12:29.340 --> 12:34.460]  families lied when they were asked in the survey and the study if they spank
[12:34.460 --> 12:37.820]  their children knowing that it's not illegal to spank your children it's
[12:37.820 --> 12:43.940]  just illegal to hurt them physically and that they would have their children
[12:43.940 --> 12:48.580]  taken and I've seen this in polling science studies when when the media
[12:48.580 --> 12:52.540]  calls up a household and ask a controversial question they found that
[12:52.540 --> 12:57.620]  depending on the question around half of people will lie and go with what they
[12:57.620 --> 13:03.580]  believe the politically correct answer is and the margin of error in the study
[13:03.580 --> 13:08.580]  is more than five percent and so the whole thing is a fraud but it's in the
[13:08.580 --> 13:13.660]  Los Angeles Times spanking lowers the child's IQ researchers say being spanked
[13:13.660 --> 13:18.180]  as a child is linked to having a lower IQ according to a study presented today
[13:18.180 --> 13:23.100]  at the International Conference on Violence Abuse and Trauma in San
[13:23.100 --> 13:28.060]  Diego that's a UN NGO sponsored event and again the UN has openly stated
[13:28.060 --> 13:31.940]  hundreds of times they want to end the family they want no authority of the
[13:31.940 --> 13:34.980]  parents over the children and even if you don't spank your children they
[13:34.980 --> 13:39.620]  routinely take them for bruises on their knees of playing in the playground I
[13:39.620 --> 13:43.620]  know parents here in Austin whose children at school fall off a jungle
[13:43.620 --> 13:48.900]  gym and break their finger or arm CPS goes ahead and takes them it just goes
[13:48.900 --> 13:52.780]  children fall off the front porch knock a tooth out something that happened to
[13:52.780 --> 13:57.660]  me they try to take your children your child is it playing in a tree falls out
[13:57.660 --> 14:02.100]  this locates their shoulder they take them they are hunting your children
[14:02.100 --> 14:05.260]  they're doing everything they can to set the precedent to take them as John
[14:05.260 --> 14:10.380]  P. Holder and White House science are his own government policy textbook states
[14:10.380 --> 14:17.540]  states openly that they want to take basically all children globally and
[14:17.540 --> 14:21.220]  raise them government dormitories China is the model the first country in the
[14:21.220 --> 14:26.780]  last 30 years to attempt this of course they started with 2,000 families now it's
[14:26.780 --> 14:32.300]  20 plus thousand in England at birth or if you're on welfare or in the
[14:32.300 --> 14:35.660]  government system involved in their secure start they don't call it head
[14:35.660 --> 14:40.380]  start over there that 20,000 homes and growing they want to double it again by
[14:40.380 --> 14:45.860]  next year it'll be 40,000 have cameras in every room in the house in the kitchen
[14:45.860 --> 14:49.700]  in the bedrooms in the bathrooms government bureaucrats watch you 24
[14:49.700 --> 14:55.420]  7 making you quote eat proper meals go to sleep on time and that you don't raise
[14:55.420 --> 14:58.580]  your voice to your children now of course the government can lock them up in
[14:58.580 --> 15:02.180]  little prison cells the government can abuse them can rape them five times
[15:02.180 --> 15:06.540]  more likely in US average is even higher in England for the government to
[15:06.540 --> 15:10.660]  abuse children than any other group but they're all above the law and held to a
[15:10.660 --> 15:14.780]  different lower standard parents are whole held to a bizarre standard of no
[15:14.780 --> 15:19.660]  yelling no spanking no nothing and so the cameras will be going in your homes
[15:19.660 --> 15:23.260]  Houston police chief two years ago called for cameras and everyone's homes in
[15:23.260 --> 15:28.460]  Houston they are now taking warrantless checkpoints taking blood at checkpoints
[15:28.460 --> 15:38.980]  it just goes on and on and on and on everywhere with the different things that
[15:38.980 --> 15:49.420]  they are doing I sound a bit distracted here I had a giant stack on my desk with
[15:49.420 --> 15:56.460]  about 15 articles or so that I printed up where the mainstream media is calling
[15:56.460 --> 16:05.420]  for world government I also had a print up here of all of my YouTube clips that
[16:05.420 --> 16:18.820]  I was going to be playing no that's not it that's the YouTube stack oh doesn't
[16:18.820 --> 16:22.100]  matter we go to Google and type in New World Order and they're all print up I
[16:22.100 --> 16:27.340]  have two of them here USA today Obama set stage for New World Order Obama now
[16:27.340 --> 16:33.540]  president of the world I've got all of that the producers have begged me to
[16:33.540 --> 16:36.460]  clean the desk off every day but end up doing it about every week there's
[16:36.460 --> 16:40.900]  literally probably a thousand or more articles sitting here on my stack
[16:40.900 --> 16:45.340]  Sarkozy's called for a new world order basically every world leader we know of
[16:45.340 --> 16:49.140]  Gordon Brown Sarkozy the Brazilian president they've all called for a new
[16:49.140 --> 16:56.740]  world order and they described what that new world order is and they say it's a
[16:56.740 --> 17:05.980]  banking dictatorship over the planet the only person the only world leader to
[17:05.980 --> 17:14.140]  slam it was the president of the Czech Republic Vakhov Klaus and he slammed
[17:14.140 --> 17:18.580]  global government and said we don't want global governance but it will ruin our
[17:18.580 --> 17:28.580]  society and I've got that in my stack from Wednesday this is very bizarre but
[17:28.580 --> 17:34.140]  I will no doubt find it during the break I had it when I started the show but
[17:34.140 --> 17:41.620]  we're gonna go over all of this today one of the other huge huge huge huge huge
[17:41.620 --> 17:47.340]  issues that we're going to be covering today is military police kidnapped G20
[17:47.340 --> 17:56.980]  protester shove him into unmarked car and this is on video now we've got scores
[17:56.980 --> 18:01.460]  I mean scores of videos of police coming up to women doing nothing and Billy
[18:01.460 --> 18:04.940]  clubbing them in the head or tackling them for some reason they love to attack
[18:04.940 --> 18:09.020]  women we've got video of the sound cannons firing at people that is right
[18:09.020 --> 18:15.500]  out of a sci-fi nightmare sci-fi dystopic movie black armored vehicles police and
[18:15.500 --> 18:19.820]  military police in black uniforms broadcasting this is an unlawful
[18:19.820 --> 18:24.460]  assembly you must disperse and then firing rubber bullets and beanbags at
[18:24.460 --> 18:29.580]  people in tear gas and sound cannons and then military just pulling up in
[18:29.580 --> 18:34.460]  unmarked cars jumping out in military uniforms and grabbing peaceful protesters
[18:34.460 --> 18:38.780]  and slamming them into cars and dragging them away but I see the officers the
[18:38.780 --> 18:45.620]  military men smiling and we saw this in Ottawa in 2008 at the SPP security
[18:45.620 --> 18:50.060]  prosperity partnership summit and it did and I said that's fake that is a
[18:50.060 --> 18:56.020]  provocateur staging stuff for the media and then the police stage arrest of them
[18:56.020 --> 19:00.020]  and well it will probably not be in contacted by the person and some of
[19:00.020 --> 19:04.980]  us in the show if they're not a fed but preliminarily I will give you the
[19:04.980 --> 19:10.900]  preliminary judgment this is staged now why would they be staging the arrest
[19:10.900 --> 19:20.100]  again unmarked champagne crown Vic pulls up three military MPs pile out they grab
[19:20.100 --> 19:23.620]  the guy and it looks like the urban warfare drills I've been to where they
[19:23.620 --> 19:28.180]  hire actors to scream and yell and say oh no not the camp why would they be
[19:28.180 --> 19:34.660]  staging snatching grabs now it may be real either way it's bad they're either
[19:34.660 --> 19:38.340]  training everybody to accept snatching grabs of military or it really happened
[19:38.340 --> 19:41.660]  and the reports are pouring in that know the military is arresting people for no
[19:41.660 --> 19:46.740]  reason but this looks stage now I can't play the audios love to go to it once we

[34:43.460 --> 34:50.860]  Rockefeller the big patriarch of the Rockefeller family 150 something years
[34:50.860 --> 34:55.500]  ago when he got going his father talk about a devilish looking guy with his
[34:55.500 --> 34:59.100]  big beard you can pull up the Rockefeller family history online look at
[34:59.100 --> 35:03.420]  him he was a snake oil salesman that made a whole bunch of money selling
[35:03.420 --> 35:09.260]  opium as a cure all in bottles and then he was the first snake oil salesman to
[35:09.260 --> 35:13.700]  not just send out a wagon himself and go town to town he thought I'll
[35:13.700 --> 35:17.940]  franchise this I'll have warehouses all over the east and the west as the
[35:17.940 --> 35:24.220]  railroads expanded and he thought of branding and banners and the name of
[35:24.220 --> 35:29.900]  his company and he sent out thousands of wagons on the trains to go to even the
[35:29.900 --> 35:36.300]  smallest town selling snake oil and they made tens of millions of dollars in
[35:36.300 --> 35:42.820]  1840s 50s and 60s money and then when he died he gave John D every centella of
[35:42.820 --> 35:47.540]  it and John D struck oil and created a monopoly over that with standard oil and
[35:47.540 --> 35:53.260]  John D then hired Pakerton security to go out to small towns where people set up
[35:53.260 --> 35:57.180]  gold mines and they would walk in blow the sheriff's head off kill the mayor
[35:57.180 --> 36:02.660]  burn the town down and bring in different mercenary forces now that's who
[36:02.660 --> 36:08.420]  set up the new world order they sent out wagons with opium and they got
[36:08.420 --> 36:13.060]  everybody addicted to drugs and they got filthy rich off that and then they went
[36:13.060 --> 36:16.980]  out and took the gold mines and took the coal mines and they went out at gunpoint
[36:16.980 --> 36:21.060]  and took the silver mines and they went out and took over the oil fields and
[36:21.060 --> 36:27.900]  they rule this planet with the Queen of England and the Rothschilds period because
[36:27.900 --> 36:33.780]  John D's daddy I forget his name me a favorite pull up John D Rockefeller the
[36:33.780 --> 36:41.180]  first father it'll pull up I forget his name John D Rockefeller's father I
[36:41.180 --> 36:44.380]  forget his name we go live at prison planet on TV next hour we'll have that
[36:44.380 --> 36:47.460]  and have his name for after the name escapes me at the time but that's the
[36:47.460 --> 36:50.260]  history of it I've studied it read several books on it and it's on the
[36:50.260 --> 36:55.300]  Rockefeller's own family website I've got a PBS documentary about the Rockefellers
[36:55.300 --> 37:00.260]  made 15 years ago or so I guess early 90s more than that now and they just
[37:00.260 --> 37:07.260]  brag about the whole thing and all the famous cases you ever seen that Clint
[37:07.260 --> 37:13.180]  Eastwood movie it's not High Plains Drifter but it's a similar one it's the
[37:13.180 --> 37:18.940]  one where he goes into little town and the local gold mining company brings in
[37:18.940 --> 37:22.700]  the regulators who start killing all the gold miners who won't hand over their
[37:22.700 --> 37:27.340]  land that is based on a whole bunch of true stories they did that in Oklahoma
[37:27.340 --> 37:32.340]  and Colorado they did that in Texas they did that in California and they just
[37:32.340 --> 37:35.540]  walk right up the little kids and put a gun right to their head in a famous case
[37:35.540 --> 37:39.700]  in Colorado that happened in the last century they came into a gold mining town
[37:39.700 --> 37:43.860]  wrote down the families burned it down shot little kids in the back killed
[37:43.860 --> 37:50.980]  hundreds there's just too many cases of this and that's all they are they're
[37:50.980 --> 37:56.740]  there they're snake oil salesman that took that money and learned how to
[37:56.740 --> 38:00.540]  create monopolies and learned how to hire mercenaries and what are they doing
[38:00.540 --> 38:03.420]  today with the mercenaries with black water and all the rest of these
[38:03.420 --> 38:07.700]  companies what are they doing to our nation what have they turned us into they
[38:07.700 --> 38:11.500]  own the private prisons they own the banks that launder the drug money they
[38:11.500 --> 38:16.820]  control the conduits that ship the drugs in they own it and run it and dominate
[38:16.820 --> 38:22.940]  it all and if you look at David Rockefeller he has funded hundreds of
[38:22.940 --> 38:30.860]  groups calling for world government he makes George Soros look like a small
[38:30.860 --> 38:35.500]  time amateur at running groups and Soros funds hundreds of groups on record
[38:35.500 --> 38:43.380]  billions and billions a year and this is how they dominate our planet this is
[38:43.380 --> 38:48.500]  how they operate this is how they get their job done and now they've come in
[38:48.500 --> 38:52.060]  to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and they're openly announcing that in the next two
[38:52.060 --> 38:55.660]  years they're going to go ahead and scrap the dollar and when we lose the
[38:55.660 --> 38:59.140]  dollars the World Reserve currency that's all we've got left that's our
[38:59.140 --> 39:02.660]  export is dollars that we don't really make anything we don't really do
[39:02.660 --> 39:06.500]  anything except military and propaganda and now we're going to lose the dollar
[39:06.500 --> 39:10.380]  and on it they're going to have a new global system that regulates all the
[39:10.380 --> 39:14.340]  sub-currencies and sets the interest rates and the currency rates and they're
[39:14.340 --> 39:18.980]  openly announcing in the news in thousands of articles thousands of
[39:18.980 --> 39:27.140]  articles today not hundreds thousands today and thousands yesterday and
[39:27.140 --> 39:32.220]  thousands the day before and thousands of articles a day before that they say
[39:32.220 --> 39:38.740]  we're setting up a new order and what is that and they brag Obama says at the UN
[39:38.740 --> 39:42.940]  that a unipolar world is over but the American Empire is over that's right we
[39:42.940 --> 39:47.340]  have served our purpose to empower the world government Empire now we received
[39:47.340 --> 39:51.300]  into history we are looted we become a third world police state that just
[39:51.300 --> 39:57.380]  supplies military hardware and troops and Europe and China become the center of
[39:57.380 --> 40:01.460]  the new world order along with Russia and the global taxation system with the
[40:01.460 --> 40:08.180]  carbon tax is now being erected and set up and they explained that that is what
[40:08.180 --> 40:11.620]  it means the group of 20 rich and developing countries is to take on a
[40:11.620 --> 40:16.260]  new role as caretaker of the global economy oh they'll be the caretaker the
[40:16.260 --> 40:20.220]  London Telegraph says giving rising stars such as China and India more say in
[40:20.220 --> 40:27.300]  world affairs and Obama now chairs you see the 15 member rotating Security
[40:27.300 --> 40:32.740]  Council has always had the US ambassador to the UN sharing it when it falls to
[40:32.740 --> 40:38.100]  the United States every 15 months because article one section nine states the
[40:38.100 --> 40:40.780]  president can't serve a foreign government or corporation or swear and
[40:40.780 --> 40:46.700]  oath any other group or take a title of nobility can't take a job as the
[40:46.700 --> 40:50.700]  chairman of the East India Company can't take a job can't become knighted by the
[40:50.700 --> 40:54.380]  throne and all of its duties can't be part of another government can't be a
[40:54.380 --> 40:58.180]  minister in the Austrian or the Chinese government and you certainly can't be a
[40:58.180 --> 41:06.380]  minister in the G 20 you certainly that and again that's the governmental chairs
[41:06.380 --> 41:10.300]  of the banking system of the nation states and you certainly can't as a
[41:10.300 --> 41:16.620]  president be seated as the chairman of the UN Security Council and its 15
[41:16.620 --> 41:23.180]  members but President Obama did it and he's now being called the president of
[41:23.180 --> 41:32.900]  the world that's what they're doing and he's setting the precedent and that's
[41:32.900 --> 41:35.420]  why and later we're going to play the video of this when we're live at
[41:35.420 --> 41:41.540]  prisonplanet.tv but play the audio for radio listeners that's why whenever
[41:41.540 --> 41:47.780]  Obama two days ago gaveled in the UN Security Council Henry Kissinger that
[41:47.780 --> 41:53.300]  was there and Obama thanked him with his mouth hanging open Susan Rice US
[41:53.300 --> 41:58.420]  ambassador the UN was in ecstasy behind him Rahm Emanuel was in ecstasy some of
[41:58.420 --> 42:02.540]  them general James L Jones the head of the National Security Council the
[42:02.540 --> 42:10.660]  North com dictatorship rice was shaking rice was in ecstasy they in fact they
[42:10.660 --> 42:14.460]  admitted on CNN and Fox that everyone was twittering in the chamber and
[42:14.460 --> 42:19.940]  freaking out over him quote becoming president of the world and then a new
[42:19.940 --> 42:23.940]  world order had been born and Obama didn't look too excited when he was
[42:23.940 --> 42:30.580]  sworn in or gave a speech to be US president January 21st of 2009 but
[42:30.580 --> 42:38.340]  when Obama gavel his voice was shaking he radiated a hitlerian type energy that
[42:38.340 --> 42:43.420]  dictator energy I've seen out of Mao Stalin and Hitler and he truly blazed
[42:43.420 --> 42:49.060]  with the demoniac glow go watch it for yourself I mean this was at every
[42:49.060 --> 42:52.180]  instinctive and political and intellectual level in my soul and heart
[42:52.180 --> 42:58.380]  and mind intellect this really shook me in the last two days to watch this he is
[42:58.380 --> 43:02.860]  the prototype of things to come but they're openly announcing world taxes
[43:02.860 --> 43:06.220]  world regulation shutting down our economy kids
[43:06.220 --> 43:09.940]  tabling on their parents' climate cops writing their parents tickets from the
[43:09.940 --> 43:13.740]  public school the public schools becoming the spy bases to take over the
[43:13.740 --> 43:21.740]  communities it is all happening what you're seeing is the complete destruction
[43:21.740 --> 43:25.660]  and fall the Republic now we can use this against them though like judo
[43:25.660 --> 43:28.980]  they're openly announcing world government openly announcing world
[43:28.980 --> 43:33.540]  taxation openly announcing no free speech in major US cities when any big
[43:33.540 --> 43:38.500]  event happens sound canning nine-year-old children in their front yards in
[43:38.500 --> 43:41.780]  neighborhoods driving down empty streets announcing no one's allowed to be on
[43:41.780 --> 43:46.660]  the streets that is classical martial law invoking the Patriot Act of
[43:46.660 --> 43:49.660]  Pennsylvania that's the code they're invoking Pennsylvania was chosen for
[43:49.660 --> 43:54.180]  this meeting because it has the most draconian state laws remember back in
[43:54.180 --> 43:57.860]  2003 they passed the Pennsylvania Patriot Act that has the sneak and peeks the
[43:57.860 --> 44:02.060]  secret arrest the snatching grabs and the military is now snatching and grabbing
[44:02.060 --> 44:06.620]  just pulling up and randomly it appears grabbing peaceful protesters off the
[44:06.620 --> 44:11.500]  streets but the police and the military are laughing and it looks completely
[44:11.500 --> 44:15.940]  staged but just setting that precedent of snatching grabs they pull up in a
[44:15.940 --> 44:21.340]  van or a car grab you by your shoulders and drag you screaming into the vehicle
[44:21.340 --> 44:27.660]  it is unspeakably evil and they're setting these beta test precedent just
[44:27.660 --> 44:31.460]  like they did in 99 with Seattle saying no free speech allowed in the city after
[44:31.460 --> 44:34.740]  they had 50 hired anarchist stage attacks on police and that was all
[44:34.740 --> 44:40.300]  declassified run by the Delta Force the FBI the Secret Service the G20 admits and
[44:40.300 --> 44:42.980]  Pittsburgh admits that the Secret Service and Army are running this
[44:42.980 --> 44:48.700]  operation look at my reporters defense link puts out a press release says that
[44:48.700 --> 44:51.580]  media can come talk to them where they're massing at the National Guard
[44:51.580 --> 44:54.860]  Armory they pull up the front gate say hi we're from info wars were from

[45:04.020 --> 45:06.820]  talk to your boss then they got me on the phone then they laughed at us and get
[45:06.820 --> 45:10.860]  out of here maybe come back tomorrow then they call the police and say people
[45:10.860 --> 45:14.180]  are at our perimeter sneaking around they ran from us we got their plate
[45:14.180 --> 45:18.020]  number the police call us up on the cell phone they got from the rent car company
[45:18.020 --> 45:23.340]  posing as an Alamo rental car person and say we know you're terrorist you're
[45:23.340 --> 45:27.660]  never gonna get off the terrorist watch list in your life laughing about it this
[45:27.660 --> 45:31.740]  is the new secret police America nine-year-olds being hit with sound
[45:31.740 --> 45:39.540]  cannons by police in black uniforms in the army here seeing in crowing and but
[45:39.540 --> 45:44.220]  at the same time whitewashing like oh for a day no he's not head of the United
[45:44.220 --> 45:48.300]  Nations for a day and if you study the UN power structure the secretary general
[45:48.300 --> 45:53.700]  is the head of the General Assembly but 180 plus nations in it only 15 have
[45:53.700 --> 45:59.900]  voting power the real government it's not the shadow government but it is you
[45:59.900 --> 46:03.900]  don't really hear about it in the media much but you notice one veto of one
[46:03.900 --> 46:09.580]  Security Council member can override the entire General Assembly it's the real
[46:09.580 --> 46:13.060]  power and Barack Obama is now the president of the UN he's now the
[46:13.060 --> 46:19.420]  chairman of the UN Security Council here is singing in celebrating Barack Obama
[46:19.420 --> 46:23.700]  calls some usually dull diplomats to come to life in the historic United
[46:23.700 --> 46:29.300]  Nations Security Council Obama's UN debut created a star even in a room packed
[46:29.300 --> 46:35.540]  with heads of state and government and for a couple of hours you could say
[46:35.540 --> 46:40.100]  mr. Obama was president of the world flanked by Secretary of State Hillary
[46:40.100 --> 46:44.900]  Clinton and UN Ambassador Susan Rice mr. Obama used the United States one
[46:44.900 --> 46:49.420]  month council presidency to drive approval of a resolution aimed at putting
[46:49.420 --> 46:53.900]  more teeth into curbing the spread of nuclear weapons prior to now there have
[46:53.900 --> 46:57.900]  been only four such a Security Council summits I called for this one so that we
[46:57.900 --> 47:01.620]  may address at the highest level a fundamental threat to the security of
[47:01.620 --> 47:07.020]  all peoples and all nations the spread and use of nuclear weapons the
[47:07.020 --> 47:11.300]  resolution calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent military
[47:11.300 --> 47:15.660]  usage or theft the US wants the resolution to provide momentum for
[47:15.660 --> 47:20.300]  action on nukes oh yeah let's stop right there of his diplomat how did they sell
[47:20.300 --> 47:23.140]  the League of Nations after the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and others
[47:23.140 --> 47:27.820]  British intelligence on record stage the assassination of the arts duke start
[47:27.820 --> 47:33.820]  World War one they said we have to have this to end war then they got their
[47:33.820 --> 47:37.380]  League of Nations and they staged World War two telling Hitler to go ahead and
[47:37.380 --> 47:41.900]  invade that's now been declassified and setting him up I'm saying he's good it's
[47:41.900 --> 47:45.940]  just a fact they set him up that's why the deputy furor Rudolph has flew into
[47:45.940 --> 47:49.740]  England with the treaty saying look we signed a secret treaty the king of
[47:49.740 --> 47:55.300]  England had to advocate he'd been a Nazi but now they've always pushed the UN
[47:55.300 --> 47:58.340]  oh we got to have a world government global governance to stop a nuclear war
[47:58.340 --> 48:02.620]  all the globalists give nukes out to everybody they gave it to Russia they
[48:02.620 --> 48:05.700]  gave it to China on record they gave it to Pakistan they gave it to South
[48:05.700 --> 48:10.900]  Africa they gave it to Israel and now we got to have a world government to stop
[48:10.900 --> 48:14.420]  nukes spreading so that's just the front but the real power they want is
[48:14.420 --> 48:18.460]  financial now here is Obama this is directly from the UN
[48:18.460 --> 48:27.300]  gabbling in the Security Council as the president of the world here it is
[48:27.300 --> 48:30.940]  that's the UN intro

[49:56.180 --> 50:02.220]  directly from the United Nations what we just played now he is the president of
[50:02.220 --> 50:06.380]  the world and that's how this six system works with the 15 members they each get
[50:06.380 --> 50:09.220]  to be president of the world and that's how they consider themselves as what
[50:09.220 --> 50:14.820]  they are openly announced as and coming up in 15 months again he will be the
[50:14.820 --> 50:19.020]  president of the world one more time and in all the financial times of London
[50:19.020 --> 50:22.740]  headlines and a whole bunch of others they say this is cementing world
[50:22.740 --> 50:25.860]  government that Obama is bringing the US into world government that he is
[50:25.860 --> 50:30.380]  relinquishing US control over the world government it's well known the US runs
[50:30.380 --> 50:36.140]  the world government right now and it was the Pentagon in 1946 that created the
[50:36.140 --> 50:40.100]  United Nations at the Presidio Naval Base in San Francisco the Rockefellers
[50:40.100 --> 50:48.660]  put the money up for it there to lease the base and in New York and so this is
[50:48.660 --> 50:54.220]  a horrible day for our nation our military our government our traders
[50:54.220 --> 50:57.380]  they've totally sold us out and they're gonna steal everything that's even
[50:57.380 --> 51:03.660]  nailed down you got that cigarettes national comm would like to introduce
[51:03.660 --> 51:07.900]  an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners it's
[51:07.900 --> 51:12.740]  called the e-cigarette it looks feels tastes and delivers nicotine like a

[55:04.340 --> 55:07.620]  completely normal that everybody has cancer everybody's dying and the
[55:07.620 --> 55:12.140]  globalists are just laughing and giggling and snickering about it yeah that
[55:12.140 --> 55:15.260]  sounds like a nightmare well it is Hitler was a nightmare Stalin was a
[55:15.260 --> 55:19.740]  nightmare Mao was a nightmare they were all funded by these people Pol Pot all
[55:19.740 --> 55:24.260]  of them we have the government documents we have the proof it isn't just a
[55:24.260 --> 55:28.020]  world government that's gonna tax you and run your life with Tobin taxes and
[55:28.020 --> 55:33.340]  money transfer taxes and carbon taxes world government is only the tool as
[55:33.340 --> 55:37.660]  John P. Holder and White House science are says the planetary regime is the tool
[55:37.660 --> 55:47.500]  to kill you and the reason they may succeed is because it's so bold it's so
[55:47.500 --> 55:54.820]  off the charts it's so outrageous it's so criminal it's so corrupt that they
[55:54.820 --> 55:59.940]  would openly in the last year still over 50 trillion worldwide 23.7 trillion
[55:59.940 --> 56:03.860]  again that's a two month old number it'll be 28 trillion following the trend
[56:03.860 --> 56:09.540]  next 28 trail plus I was underestimated what it's gonna be next time they
[56:09.540 --> 56:13.980]  announce it every two months we're due to hear 23.7 trillion almost two months
[56:13.980 --> 56:18.980]  ago we're due to hear the new number and I cringe and they just are openly
[56:18.980 --> 56:22.620]  stealing every treasury blind openly deploying police and military on the
[56:22.620 --> 56:28.020]  streets everywhere openly coming in with tyranny now if we speak out and point
[56:28.020 --> 56:32.020]  out that it's just a group of private bankers doing this we could start
[56:32.020 --> 56:35.540]  reversing it that's why one of our biggest hopes is Ron Paul's resolution
[56:35.540 --> 56:38.660]  to audit these people because we're starting the process and beginning to
[56:38.660 --> 56:43.380]  really draw blood in the fight really beginning to land some strong punches on
[56:43.380 --> 56:47.340]  the enemy that people are now going to wait banks run the country private banks
[56:47.340 --> 56:51.380]  control the government all over the world people are finding out as the in
[56:51.380 --> 56:54.900]  the Fed movement goes global and they're starting to get scared that's why
[56:54.900 --> 56:58.820]  they're accelerating their program right now they were trying incremental but
[56:58.820 --> 57:02.500]  they were starting to fail they realized they're now behind the eight ball this
[57:02.500 --> 57:09.300]  is red level emergency this is real gut up and get educated about this stuff I
[57:09.300 --> 57:13.660]  know that you want to rationalize and tell yourself this isn't true because
[57:13.660 --> 57:18.460]  it's scary but listen it is real we've proven it's real in in-game and terror
[57:18.460 --> 57:22.300]  storm and the Obama deception and all the mainstream news is now confirming
[57:22.300 --> 57:29.780]  everything we told you but they put their own sick spin on it and support us
[57:29.980 --> 57:34.540]  that's why the establishment with the mainstream media and alternative media
[57:34.540 --> 57:38.900]  attacks Ron Paul attacks me attacks anybody that they know is effectively
[57:38.900 --> 57:44.420]  countering them to try to get everybody fighting with each other with divide and
[57:44.420 --> 57:47.740]  conquer instead of identifying the new old order Ron Paul isn't the one raising
[57:47.740 --> 57:51.100]  your taxes Ron Paul isn't the one bringing in a world carbon tax Ron Paul
[57:51.100 --> 57:58.220]  isn't the one taking over our economy Alex Jones and that's me I'm not the one
[57:58.220 --> 58:01.100]  that runs your life I'm not the one that's putting cancer viruses in the
[58:01.100 --> 58:04.500]  vaccine to try to make you take them and so when the feds try to get us all in
[58:04.500 --> 58:08.900]  fighting realize that that's their attempt with Co and tell pro and they
[58:08.900 --> 58:12.700]  also use just the general public's jealousy of anybody successful to play
[58:12.700 --> 58:16.540]  us off against each other you ever seen crabs in a bucket of your crab fishing
[58:16.540 --> 58:19.300]  at the beach put three or four in the bucket they could climb out if they
[58:19.300 --> 58:22.460]  worked with each other but any crab that tries to climb out they all run over and
[58:22.460 --> 58:28.900]  pinch him and dragging down if we don't get over the crab in the bucket syndrome
[58:30.340 --> 58:34.220]  well you're gonna see what's gonna happen but we are mounting a successful

[1:00:44.340 --> 1:00:48.780]  president Obama has been announced as president of the world at the UN and
[1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:53.340]  illegally taken the chairmanship of the UN Security Council the only true
[1:00:53.340 --> 1:00:56.940]  governing body in the UN that has power the General Assembly is a puppet
[1:00:56.940 --> 1:01:02.300]  powerless assembly and assembly admits that he's now more powerful in the UN
[1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:06.300]  secretary general he's now more powerful in the US president he holds the dual
[1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:13.940]  post Jason Douglass is with us live from protest in day two of the opening
[1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:19.980]  announcement for world government and the end of the dollar Jason Bermas is
[1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:23.860]  at another location we'll go to both of them after the break when we go live at
[1:01:23.860 --> 1:01:28.420]  prisonplanet.tv with a complete report Jason Douglass what are you
[1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:32.860]  witnessing right now right now I'm in the middle of the United Field Workers
[1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:39.660]  Union and there are so many groups here all very distrustful that what's
[1:01:39.660 --> 1:01:43.260]  happening with us the current state of the world we are just marching off the
[1:01:43.260 --> 1:01:50.220]  UPenn campus I would estimate there's about 2,000 plus people in here it's
[1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:54.820]  still very peaceful you know people just speaking their minds and marching
[1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:59.300]  forward he used the sound cannons on us again
[1:01:59.300 --> 1:02:04.340]  well just to be clear how this works the city has said no protest allowed no
[1:02:04.340 --> 1:02:08.940]  permits being issued no First Amendment and so right at the time the police are
[1:02:08.940 --> 1:02:14.540]  about to engage the peaceful people 10 to 15 hired federal agents dressed as
[1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:19.900]  anarchists will tump over a few trash cans for a stage CNN Fox News photo op
[1:02:19.900 --> 1:02:23.820]  they will then attack the peaceful crowd the police will with beanbags
[1:02:23.820 --> 1:02:32.380]  rubber bullets pepper spray CS and the sound weapons this is the MO it's key
[1:02:32.380 --> 1:02:37.740]  Jason that you show people on video how right when the police arrive and try to
[1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:42.620]  block you and announce that it's an unawful assembly the public would see
[1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:47.620]  that on the news is abusive unless the staged anarchists give them the pretext
[1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:54.340]  to attack that will happen exactly they are definitely looking for any sort of
[1:02:54.340 --> 1:02:59.980]  excuse I mean they're all bad already and you know most of every people are
[1:02:59.980 --> 1:03:03.900]  just walking walking around speaking their mind you do have these small on
[1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:08.820]  plays of people that are you know they're pretending that they're really
[1:03:08.820 --> 1:03:14.100]  dissatisfied but it's just obvious that they're hired where is everybody
[1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:18.660]  marching to we're trying to make it to the convention center they wouldn't
[1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:24.020]  even let the permitted protest go that direction you know they're just
[1:03:24.020 --> 1:03:28.060]  ostriches with their heads on the news is they're not allowing any protest you're
[1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:32.060]  saying there is a permitted March there was one on the 20th and they wouldn't
[1:03:32.060 --> 1:03:35.220]  even let that one go there wasn't even anyone down at the convention center
[1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:40.180]  but they still didn't let it go down there we've seen photos and videos of the
[1:03:40.180 --> 1:03:44.940]  sound weapon trucks armored vehicles even in neighborhoods Jason where there's
[1:03:44.940 --> 1:03:48.220]  literally one or two people on the street like a nine-year-old kid with a
[1:03:48.220 --> 1:03:55.540]  ball in his front yard and they still drive by and blast him yeah yeah I was
[1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:59.380]  standing by one home it had you know several family members out on the suit

[1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:26.300]  and blocked it in and came up and sprayed babies and baby carriages and the
[1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:29.980]  mother said why are you spraying my baby and the policeman said listening you
[1:04:29.980 --> 1:04:33.460]  you effing bleeper you shouldn't bring a kid to a protest so they love
[1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:41.700]  targeting children especially well what else do you expect from Satanist they

[1:08:06.740 --> 1:08:13.340]  war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:16.740 --> 1:08:22.580]  that is the sounds of the mark we estimate to be more than 2,000 people in
[1:08:22.580 --> 1:08:26.900]  Pittsburgh marching from the university to the convention center where the G20
[1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:32.220]  is meeting jason bermas is there at the head of the march at the end of the
[1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:37.300]  march is rob do and jason douglas will be going to all of them I'll be
[1:08:37.300 --> 1:08:42.300]  recapping all the big developments that have happened they are using sound
[1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:45.500]  cannons even in neighborhoods on children and people on their front
[1:08:45.500 --> 1:08:49.660]  porches they go into even small side streets and announced no one allowed on
[1:08:49.660 --> 1:08:54.060]  the streets basically a Pittsburgh they invoke the state's patriot act that they
[1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:59.020]  have it's very draconian it has been confirmed they're using sound cannons
[1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:04.540]  even CNN admits that but neocon sites are denying it exist because they're
[1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:08.020]  basically pentagon run that's a military tactic they're still saying there's no
[1:09:08.020 --> 1:09:10.940]  new world order they're still saying there's no bank of the world they're
[1:09:10.940 --> 1:09:14.740]  still saying there's no global carbon tax in the media as they simultaneously
[1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:19.740]  announce it that's a psychological warfare tactic to say we're not assaulting
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:23.940]  you while they're assaulting mindless neocons claim g20 abduction video is fake
[1:09:23.940 --> 1:09:28.340]  it is clearly not fake these are real military officers and a real police
[1:09:28.340 --> 1:09:33.340]  crown Vic jumping out and grabbing a protester and dragging him away I'm
[1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:38.660]  saying that it could be staged in that it's real military we know that but that
[1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:43.580]  they could be staging snatch and grabs as we know they did in Ottawa the royal
[1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:48.340]  mounted police have admitted last year that they staged a attack on their own
[1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:53.660]  police then had to fake arrest the anarchist put them into police cars
[1:09:53.660 --> 1:10:00.700]  that's admitted Toronto's son but of course the neocon websites are not
[1:10:00.700 --> 1:10:04.700]  going to admit that they're just gonna keep saying nothing's happening there's
[1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:08.380]  no sound cannons none of this is going on stand down this is not an assault
[1:10:08.380 --> 1:10:13.980]  classic pentagon operation they're also of course saying that the video of sound
[1:10:13.980 --> 1:10:17.900]  cannons and police in black uniforms in the army sound cannoning people
[1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:21.900]  including children is fake it's all admitted but they're gonna make it about
[1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:26.140]  a debate of whether it's real or not so we never psychologically have a debate
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:29.340]  on whether it's good to have the military sound cannoning children and
[1:10:29.340 --> 1:10:34.020]  saying no protest allowed they may even say Pittsburgh doesn't exist they may
[1:10:34.020 --> 1:10:37.980]  even say Pennsylvania doesn't exist so you will then debate with them that
[1:10:37.980 --> 1:10:44.460]  Pennsylvania exist there over 8,000 news articles today on Google news if you put
[1:10:44.460 --> 1:10:48.620]  the term new world order in over 8,000 openly announcing it's a global
[1:10:48.620 --> 1:10:52.660]  government global tax that the US is going down that Obama is great for
[1:10:52.660 --> 1:10:57.140]  being the new president of the world chairing the UN Security Council the UN
[1:10:57.140 --> 1:11:02.740]  Security Council exist Obama exist all of this exist and but if they can just
[1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:06.900]  keep saying it doesn't exist while they say it exists and it's good then when
[1:11:06.900 --> 1:11:11.220]  you say I don't like it they then say it doesn't exist Burma's that is classical
[1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:15.020]  psychological warfare Jason Burma's reporting from the head of the march and
[1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:21.940]  Pittsburgh Pennsylvania right now it looks like a little over 2,000 people
[1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:27.140]  they are condensed into one street there seems to be much less of a police
[1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:31.460]  presence at this march at least at the moment we're not really anywhere near
[1:11:31.460 --> 1:11:36.220]  downtown Pittsburgh yet so we'll see what happens as we approach it if they
[1:11:36.220 --> 1:11:41.540]  let us go over into the downtown area I highly doubt it the downtown area is
[1:11:41.540 --> 1:11:46.860]  where you see the heaviest concentration of military right now I'm taping and
[1:11:46.860 --> 1:11:49.940]  this is more of an eclectic group yesterday I didn't see any of the
[1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:55.420]  Iraqi war veterans against the war here I'm seeing dozens if not hundreds I'm
[1:11:55.420 --> 1:11:59.700]  seeing around a hundred hundred and fifty pre-depraved protesters it seems
[1:11:59.700 --> 1:12:03.140]  like you know although there is an anarchist element here there's somewhere
[1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:06.420]  towards the middle of the crowd and we can only hope that they won't be able
[1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:10.380]  to provide for the event today as they did yesterday well what they're gonna do
[1:12:10.380 --> 1:12:14.260]  is they're gonna wait till you get to the place where the police are masked in
[1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:21.700]  front and to the sides then once you get into the trap police will come from
[1:12:21.700 --> 1:12:26.300]  behind then the anarchist for the news media will then come out of the middle
[1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:31.500]  go to the front they'll probably stage it with the police on a hill so they can
[1:12:31.500 --> 1:12:35.100]  roll a garbage dumpster at them for dramatic effect like I did yesterday
[1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:38.660]  they'll then open fire with rubber bullets pepper spray and sound cannons
[1:12:38.660 --> 1:12:43.340]  on the 2000 so the media can replay yesterday and every other big event
[1:12:43.340 --> 1:12:48.220]  we've seen here's the key Burmese Jason Burmese reporting from Pittsburgh
[1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:52.540]  we're gonna play this video which the neocons are saying is fake they're
[1:12:52.540 --> 1:12:56.140]  saying it's not real military it's clearly real military they're clearly
[1:12:56.140 --> 1:13:01.460]  wearing the real badge it's a plastic clear badge with a white badge for the
[1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:06.660]  police to recognize in the arm it's clearly an unmarked crown Vic you can
[1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:10.260]  look it's military they're well conditioned they're in good shape
[1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:15.460]  they're big military police cops you see the classic hired informant types
[1:13:15.460 --> 1:13:20.580]  giving hand signals when you watch the video they're giving hand signals to the
[1:13:20.580 --> 1:13:26.340]  police and and they the guy is smiling and laughing and the cops are just like
[1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:29.900]  the urban warfare drills they do they then do the drills live-action but don't
[1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:33.780]  tell people their drills I'm almost sure watching this video as they throw him
[1:13:33.780 --> 1:13:38.380]  in he's laughing and the guy with them gives a hand signal to police they drive
[1:13:38.380 --> 1:13:43.780]  off into tear gas this is a psi op to sell people on the idea that the
[1:13:43.780 --> 1:13:47.980]  military pulls up and grabs you into a car and that's how they protect their
[1:13:47.980 --> 1:13:52.100]  people that have just engaged in some type of violence we didn't see that on
[1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:56.140]  the video but the video is very short that may have happened earlier for the
[1:13:56.140 --> 1:14:08.860]  police to have a pretext to crack down on people jason berness you got 12
[1:14:08.860 --> 1:14:14.340]  trillion dollars in counting of course we know it's over 12 27 trillion at this
[1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:20.580]  point I would really hate to see this be ruined of course we saw the chaos
[1:14:20.580 --> 1:14:24.580]  yesterday and you know I'm prepared for anything hopefully I'm gonna get to be
[1:14:24.580 --> 1:14:27.820]  able to talk to some of these protesters when we get down to the downtown
[1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:32.900]  area but I am seeing a lot of signs that are really busting through the left
[1:14:32.900 --> 1:14:38.060]  right paradigm a few people are a amalgamation of both Barack Obama and
[1:14:38.060 --> 1:14:42.860]  George Bush as one being they get it they understand this war is not over this
[1:14:42.860 --> 1:14:47.300]  war is not ending the economy is only getting worse we are moving towards
[1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:50.660]  global governance of course you have a lot of well-meaning idiots out here as
[1:14:50.660 --> 1:14:55.900]  well but we can only hope to reach them Alex well I'm we're playing video right
[1:14:55.900 --> 1:15:01.740]  now of last night at the university with police and military and military and
[1:15:01.740 --> 1:15:06.700]  riot here with shotguns we rubber bullets that will kill you if they shoot
[1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:09.980]  you from 5 10 feet away in many cases there's been a lot of that and they
[1:15:09.980 --> 1:15:13.660]  come up with a billy club and attack an innocent woman and tackle her for
[1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:17.980]  absolutely no reason well you know yesterday when I was able to check the
[1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:22.980]  local news all after everything has died down and basically we have been loaded
[1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:26.980]  into a corner where we couldn't go anywhere for about an hour they wouldn't
[1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:32.220]  let us over a bridge even on foot I saw this one girl she must have been you
[1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:36.660]  know a hundred pounds I had interviewed her earlier in the day because she had
[1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:40.540]  a very provocative sign she had a sign that said smack an anarchist and when
[1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:43.820]  I went and talked to her about it she said look I'm all about three speech
[1:15:43.820 --> 1:15:47.500]  I'm all about protesting but when you get dressed up in black and you put a
[1:15:47.500 --> 1:15:50.980]  black mask on and you're here to destroy property what is that going to
[1:15:50.980 --> 1:15:54.700]  accomplish and I was like right on you know you're you're dead right you know
[1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:57.980]  we have our freedom of speech but those people aren't helping and that's the
[1:15:57.980 --> 1:16:01.660]  girl they are at this girl with a sign who is out there on her own trying to
[1:16:01.660 --> 1:16:06.060]  exercise a free speech and enlighten people to the fact that listen you don't
[1:16:06.060 --> 1:16:10.300]  need to you know dress in all black and think you're a tough guy and follow along
[1:16:10.300 --> 1:16:15.580]  with the tour first and pretty she had actually went to the anarchist meeting
[1:16:15.580 --> 1:16:19.460]  the night before last before yesterday's protest and was kicked out they
[1:16:19.460 --> 1:16:23.380]  didn't water there they don't want legitimate voices amongst them because
[1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:29.740]  they know they control the idiot masses well I'm watching the video of the guy
[1:16:29.740 --> 1:16:35.340]  that was arrested by the police after the military grabbed the one guy and this
[1:16:35.340 --> 1:16:42.500]  looks fake to me clearly the other guy it is fake but this person isn't an
[1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:47.780]  operative he's the later contact us and explain to us what happened but talking
[1:16:47.780 --> 1:16:53.140]  to Douglas talking to you Burmese do well Douglas has said it clearly looks
[1:16:53.140 --> 1:16:58.700]  staged with what he's seen what what do you think of these anarchists you know
[1:16:58.700 --> 1:17:01.940]  I think a lot of them are just well-meaning idiots however the
[1:17:01.940 --> 1:17:06.420]  people in charge the people that are directing them obviously have an agenda
[1:17:06.420 --> 1:17:11.660]  you know I got an interview with about 20 of the anarchists yesterday prior to
[1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:16.300]  the march and I mean they were just it was idiocy I'm like well what your
[1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:20.060]  group is called what and they were like team space bag and I'm like what is
[1:17:20.060 --> 1:17:24.380]  team space bag even mean and no one could tell me they all just gave me a
[1:17:24.380 --> 1:17:31.540]  dumb look just like okay and they said some other bolder things but the issues
[1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:35.180]  will be discussed they have no other objective other than to be there and
[1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:39.980]  try to rebel against something they know nothing about well that's how it works
[1:17:39.980 --> 1:17:44.740]  is it is that we've been at in the Fed protests and other places and these
[1:17:44.740 --> 1:17:47.980]  anarchists will come in who are well spoken in good shape and they'll say
[1:17:47.980 --> 1:17:51.740]  come on let's cause trouble let's do something bad and then in the Fed
[1:17:51.740 --> 1:17:54.460]  protesters have caught them later going yeah we can't get these people to do
[1:17:54.460 --> 1:17:58.540]  even jaywalk what are we gonna do and over and over again the feds have been
[1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:01.940]  caught provocaturing state police have been caught going into meetings and
[1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:05.420]  getting maybe one out of a thousand people in a warehouse to say they'll do
[1:18:05.420 --> 1:18:11.060]  something violent and then they raid the whole facility
[1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:15.980]  we hope that doesn't happen again I am seeing about a presence of about a
[1:18:15.980 --> 1:18:21.300]  hundred or so anarchists in the middle of the march in a concentrated area you
[1:18:21.300 --> 1:18:26.060]  know again Alex we'll see when we get down there right now the police presence is
[1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:31.460]  very very slim the guards are not arched the teeth as they were yesterday I have
[1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:36.180]  yet to see any military really the biggest concentration of all riot police
[1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:41.900]  was at the university on the way in with this protest took place started right
[1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:45.140]  around the corner but barman's this is how it always works they want the March
[1:18:45.140 --> 1:18:49.980]  concentrated because it's easier to block in once you near your destination
[1:18:49.980 --> 1:18:54.340]  that's when watch they're gonna come out and block the street then come in on the
[1:18:54.340 --> 1:18:59.340]  sides let you fill up the the pincer movement and then they're gonna close
[1:18:59.340 --> 1:19:04.180]  the gate on the back of you well let's just pray and hope that they don't start
[1:19:04.180 --> 1:19:08.140]  shooting tear gas like yesterday because I've got two two-year-olds passing me
[1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:12.340]  with their father right now and I would hate to see these toddlers get into any
[1:19:12.340 --> 1:19:18.540]  kind of situation where they would be subject to abuse from riot police and
[1:19:18.540 --> 1:19:22.340]  there's been a lot of tear gassing going on a lot of microwave gunning going on
[1:19:22.340 --> 1:19:27.420]  I mean a lot of sound cannoning going on and meanwhile the neocons are denying
[1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:31.100]  on their websites that any of this is even happening
[1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:34.780]  well it's just incredible Alex I mean I don't know how the mainstream media is
[1:19:34.780 --> 1:19:39.260]  going to cover this but this is at least 2,000 people this may be on the brink of
[1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:45.260]  3,000 you know just moving my way to the front of the line to be about 15 20
[1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:48.700]  minutes merma's do we know why they attacked I'm gonna ask this when we come
[1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:52.260]  back and ask Douglas as well stay there Jason Douglas also in another area of
[1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:55.700]  the March why did they attack the university last night I mean I've got
[1:19:55.700 --> 1:19:59.180]  any other attacking frat kids

[1:21:18.900 --> 1:21:23.060]  not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:26.900]  wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your
[1:21:26.900 --> 1:21:31.380]  retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to
[1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:34.780]  buy gold for the realist there have never been more sobering reasons to

[1:24:08.820 --> 1:24:13.700]  all right we're now going to Jason Douglas who's Rob with Rob do in Pittsburgh
[1:24:13.700 --> 1:24:17.460]  Pennsylvania and another area of the 2000 plus people that we estimate are
[1:24:17.460 --> 1:24:22.780]  marching right now from Pitt there in Pittsburgh into another area of the city
[1:24:22.780 --> 1:24:27.260]  where again are you guys marching Jason Douglas
[1:24:27.260 --> 1:24:32.500]  right now we are at Seneca Street in Fifth Avenue we're in between the
[1:24:32.500 --> 1:24:37.460]  convention center and UPenn and we're still formed in one group they haven't
[1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:42.060]  squinted us off yet and there's really been minimal police in comparison to
[1:24:42.060 --> 1:24:48.700]  yesterday. Usually they attack on the first official day because they want
[1:24:48.700 --> 1:24:53.140]  to set the precedent that protesting is bad and you're violent and bad but I
[1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:58.900]  think you're going to see even more tonight coming up continue. Basically I
[1:24:58.900 --> 1:25:02.140]  have a feeling that they're funneling us into someplace so then they'll start
[1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:04.860]  to splinter us off and then they'll close the gate just like they did
[1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:08.460]  yesterday. Yeah that's the standard operating procedure they may do
[1:25:08.460 --> 1:25:12.380]  something else you you've said on air but can you elaborate that these people
[1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:18.900]  these anarchists act and behave like feds the few engage in violence. Right well
[1:25:18.900 --> 1:25:22.460]  basically you have a large group of people dressed in black with black masks
[1:25:22.460 --> 1:25:26.900]  and you know all thing anarchist type stuff you can tell that the larger group
[1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:30.780]  you know it's people that just want something else besides what we have
[1:25:30.780 --> 1:25:36.500]  right now and are looking to anything but then you have these popos that are
[1:25:36.500 --> 1:25:41.580]  basically in control of the larger group and they're doing paramilitary stuff
[1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:47.700]  where you know they're basically funneling people and obviously working in
[1:25:47.700 --> 1:25:53.340]  coordination and then then they do these bursts of violence it's just
[1:25:53.340 --> 1:25:58.860]  provocation. I'm watching video from Pitt last night with the sound cannons
[1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:05.060]  hitting people it's just unbelievably hardcore for the radio listeners you can
[1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:09.380]  go to MFullWars.com and PrismPlanet.com and watch all these scores of videos we
[1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:12.380]  have posted to give you different snapshots of what happened we're also
[1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:17.740]  streaming this live at PrismPlanet.tv right now the video but it's just
[1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:23.020]  Jason I want these night time shots the Darth Vader element of it is
[1:26:23.020 --> 1:26:27.100]  incredibly cinematic to get the point across in the next film the Darth Vader
[1:26:27.100 --> 1:26:31.940]  we were actually out last night we drove right by the area that they said all
[1:26:31.940 --> 1:26:38.700]  the violence took place and you know we were thinking we were just there so if
[1:26:38.700 --> 1:26:43.260]  an event happened it was a coordinated event with the police and with the
[1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:48.180]  military because it happened in 15 minutes. Here they are attacking some girl
[1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:53.500]  that's got away 95 pounds she seems disoriented the sound cannons are going
[1:26:53.500 --> 1:26:57.580]  off she's asking please don't hurt me and then they just absolutely attack her
[1:26:57.580 --> 1:27:02.940]  boom Billy Club to the head boom they pull her to the ground giant 250 pound
[1:27:02.940 --> 1:27:11.100]  man piles on top of her the Darth Vader's continues stomping past unbelievable
[1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:19.380]  and the cops love bugging their eyes out at everybody with pure hatred I mean
[1:27:19.380 --> 1:27:23.460]  they've really been trained to hate the citizenry of this nation you better get
[1:27:23.460 --> 1:27:26.860]  that camera out of my face people it's like they're two different people when
[1:27:26.860 --> 1:27:30.740]  they're in the line they have a completely think they're you know you can
[1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:35.860]  tell they're combat hard but I've actually caught behind the lines that
[1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:39.340]  just the guys once they become guys and they just start talking to each other
[1:27:39.340 --> 1:27:43.580]  they're questioning their order they're actually I heard some people saying
[1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:48.220]  something like you know these people are just you know want to be heard why
[1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:55.700]  can't why can't they just let them speak so there is dissension in the race we
[1:27:55.700 --> 1:28:02.340]  are having an effect out here well the cops usually figure out later that
[1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:05.780]  there were provocateurs hired by the feds in there yet it's happened all over
[1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:09.660]  the nation people that don't aren't aware of that latest incident was Denver
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:15.900]  Post reported on what happened last year at the DNC in Denver the police were
[1:28:15.900 --> 1:28:20.180]  posing as anarchists attacking other police they also hire informants federal
[1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:26.020]  informants state informants we've got Bob Chapman coming up for 30 minutes to
[1:28:26.020 --> 1:28:29.460]  break down what's happening with the economy and what the G20s announcing

[1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:30.460]  family and that's always what massive news happens so most the time I end up
[1:33:30.460 --> 1:33:34.180]  being live here regardless we've got Dave Mustaine coming up people really
[1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:36.940]  requested to hear that interview again a lot of people missed it when it was
[1:33:36.940 --> 1:33:41.380]  live that's coming up we have a lot of other news coming up in the final hour
[1:33:41.380 --> 1:33:50.060]  today but it really doesn't matter I was listening via my iPhone over fly cast
[1:33:50.060 --> 1:33:54.620]  to the radio show today and it didn't matter if it was a show from two and a
[1:33:54.620 --> 1:33:59.380]  half weeks ago or two weeks ago because it was just as pertinent I was talking
[1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:03.300]  about how the G20 is meeting now they're having private meetings are having
[1:34:03.300 --> 1:34:08.180]  public meetings for our consumption and when they're in public meetings saying
[1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:12.820]  we want world government we want to get rid of the dollar we want to have a new
[1:34:12.820 --> 1:34:17.100]  bank of the world that controls the currency taxes and the Tobin taxes and
[1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:21.860]  the oil taxes and the carbon taxes when they're publicly saying that and
[1:34:21.860 --> 1:34:25.420]  talking about getting rid of the dollar you better believe in the private
[1:34:25.420 --> 1:34:29.860]  meetings they're figuring out how to deep sex it and so there have been three G20
[1:34:29.860 --> 1:34:34.180]  meetings in the last year and these have all been more important than Bretton
[1:34:34.180 --> 1:34:40.420]  Woods that put us on the dollar system so this is a seismic shift because first
[1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:44.460]  the fiat money masters got us deep in debt got us on the fiat system got us
[1:34:44.460 --> 1:34:50.780]  addicted to credit they created more debt between 500 and a thousand times
[1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:56.740]  more fiat debt that there was real assets in the world and that's fine the
[1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:01.300]  first phases because it allows the private banks a select few to buy up
[1:35:01.300 --> 1:35:05.660]  the roads the infrastructure the ports the ships the factory the military the
[1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:11.380]  media and then they get us deep in debt with our own fiat currency now as you
[1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:15.180]  know we've loaned 23.7 trillion and that's a two month old number it's
[1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:19.500]  probably over 28 trillion right now since October 3rd we've now passed the
[1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:26.540]  anniversary of the banker takeover last week and so now they are preparing to
[1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:31.140]  set up the private new world order it's already set up but they're unveiling it
[1:35:31.140 --> 1:35:34.980]  like when they unveil the new ship and chop the blocks and launch it into the
[1:35:34.980 --> 1:35:39.580]  ocean if you've ever seen a huge ship being built in dry dock and then the
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:42.820]  old-fashioned way they'd hack out the big blocks under and it would slide down a
[1:35:42.820 --> 1:35:48.180]  ramp into the into the channel to enter the open ocean and they've done that
[1:35:48.180 --> 1:35:51.860]  they've unveiled their world government a lot of us went behind the curtain
[1:35:51.860 --> 1:35:55.900]  peaked at it read their own documents their own blueprints old-timers 50
[1:35:55.900 --> 1:36:00.140]  years ago have all been proven exactly right and we told you what was going to
[1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.620]  happen we were behind the curtain now they've taken the curtain back they
[1:36:03.620 --> 1:36:07.900]  admit what it is it's an absolute nightmare citizen spying on everybody
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:13.260]  children being taken for absolutely no reason the state raising everyone
[1:36:13.260 --> 1:36:18.900]  cameras in all the homes watching everyone it is now here and they mean
[1:36:18.900 --> 1:36:23.220]  bloody business they're not playing games and here's the key though is Ron
[1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:26.740]  Paul and many others have said for a long time like he says in my film
[1:36:26.740 --> 1:36:32.660]  Matrix of Evil from 2004 Cicero Ron Paul makes the point that when they
[1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:36.860]  implode the global economy they're going to try to offer the solution of a
[1:36:36.860 --> 1:36:41.740]  total world government openly run by private banks is the solution and here
[1:36:41.740 --> 1:36:46.900]  we are five six years later shot in 2003 put out in 2004 the point is he said in
[1:36:46.900 --> 1:36:52.940]  2003 here we are five years later and exactly that is now coming to fruition
[1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:57.100]  not because we're psychic or have crystal balls but because the enemy has
[1:36:57.100 --> 1:37:01.220]  been quite public in their memorandums and white papers to each other just not
[1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:08.220]  to the general public so now they're unveiling their monstrosity but instead
[1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:12.540]  of letting them create the crisis and then offer the solution if we like the
[1:37:12.540 --> 1:37:16.580]  little boy pointing out that the emperors butt naked and they isn't wearing
[1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:21.420]  fine clothes the parable of the emperors new clothes if we all simply point out
[1:37:21.420 --> 1:37:24.660]  the Federal Reserve is the real governorship of this regional North
[1:37:24.660 --> 1:37:29.180]  American system if we point out the private bankers are the source of our
[1:37:29.180 --> 1:37:34.060]  misery if we point out that they are the social engineers who create the trillions
[1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:37.260]  and fiat currency to take over the planet through fraud that they're all a
[1:37:37.260 --> 1:37:43.260]  bunch of made-off slash can lay types made-offs started the the Nasdaq the
[1:37:43.260 --> 1:37:47.180]  second biggest stock exchange in the world that's who these people are just
[1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:51.060]  because they wear fancy suits and have Ivy League educations the police the
[1:37:51.060 --> 1:37:54.980]  military fall down and worship them so here's the choice the republic falls
[1:37:54.980 --> 1:38:02.340]  our liberties are completely destroyed total tyranny comes in or we stand up
[1:38:02.340 --> 1:38:07.220]  to the criminals rebuke them expose them with pamphlets you know posted around
[1:38:07.220 --> 1:38:11.940]  town with calls to talk radio with websites with going to your congressman
[1:38:11.940 --> 1:38:15.860]  everywhere they go every time they have a town hall going to their office
[1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:20.060]  beating the drum going to city council going to county commissioners never
[1:38:20.060 --> 1:38:25.100]  shutting up just hammering and hammering and hammering and saying I'm not gonna
[1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:29.340]  be distracted by Obama your puppet I'm not gonna be distracted by Mitt Romney
[1:38:29.340 --> 1:38:32.820]  when he runs probably the next president coming up at three years I'm not
[1:38:32.820 --> 1:38:37.020]  gonna be distracted by your left wing right wing fake fight sure there's a
[1:38:37.020 --> 1:38:41.580]  real fight going on there over who gets the power structure but on the issues
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:45.720]  of who's financing both sides it doesn't matter we want the fellow reserve
[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:50.260]  audited and abolished we want the fiat money masters that created this broad
[1:38:50.260 --> 1:38:54.260]  brought to justice as Ron Paul and others have said on this show there's
[1:38:54.260 --> 1:38:57.940]  plenty of evidence for criminal indictments against all of them so the
[1:38:57.940 --> 1:39:01.420]  police and the military I know a lot of you are good men and women there's no
[1:39:01.420 --> 1:39:04.980]  more time to sit here and suck your thumbs and support this it larian system
[1:39:04.980 --> 1:39:10.300]  is like German soldiers in 1940 supporting Hitler we're at the cusp of
[1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:14.180]  this happening you've got to stand up and say no and get past the peer pressure
[1:39:14.180 --> 1:39:19.260]  and speak out and not bow down to the power structure you have got to count
[1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:22.980]  the cost and realize that the supposed conspiracy theorists have been right all
[1:39:22.980 --> 1:39:27.100]  along that that that we have told the truth that we have stayed the course
[1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:31.300]  that that that those men and women out there that have been speaking out and
[1:39:31.300 --> 1:39:35.460]  standing up many of them individuals being ridiculed in their towns and
[1:39:35.460 --> 1:39:40.180]  cities are the only hope we've got and thank God for all the people that have
[1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:43.940]  been there blowing the whistle because now people are listening because we
[1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:48.500]  warned people before all of this unfolded so here's the bottom line two
[1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:52.380]  weeks ago they have their G 20 they have private breakaway groups then they
[1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:56.340]  start the process of testing the plunge of the dollar they'll probably pump the
[1:39:56.340 --> 1:40:01.500]  dollar back up one more time in the next year before they fully drop it but
[1:40:01.500 --> 1:40:09.900]  understand the media spinning this that Russia China India and others are
[1:40:09.900 --> 1:40:13.900]  implementing the destruction of the dollar ladies and gentlemen the reason
[1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:18.540]  the real power at the UN is not the secret is is not the General Assembly
[1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:23.940]  it has no power the Security Council the 15 members has all the power 100% of it
[1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:29.460]  okay and Obama is notice he's the head of that right now while this critical key
[1:40:29.460 --> 1:40:34.460]  change is happening notice this last week they handed the you the UN control of
[1:40:34.460 --> 1:40:40.220]  the internet the systems ICANN the private corporation was given full
[1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:44.140]  control and they say they'll follow UN orders notice Obama is now the head of
[1:40:44.140 --> 1:40:49.060]  the UN Security Council notice how they're now announcing the devaluation of
[1:40:49.060 --> 1:40:54.380]  the dollar they're just testing it with a long slide downward it's all happening
[1:40:54.380 --> 1:40:58.260]  right now we are now inside the new world order we are now witnessing the
[1:40:58.260 --> 1:41:03.620]  beginning phases of being inside a planetary dehumanizing world government
[1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:07.740]  so a we've got to expose the globalist and that they're the real criminals that
[1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:10.540]  they're the shadow government and quit being distracted by their puppets in
[1:41:10.540 --> 1:41:17.220]  frontmen but B we've also got to protect ourselves and again I'm not
[1:41:17.220 --> 1:41:21.500]  tooting my horn it's symbionic I believe in win-win-win-win-win I believe
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:26.180]  you can you reap what you sow that's why I've been blessed anything I promote
[1:41:26.180 --> 1:41:30.820]  anything I push I deeply believe in that's why I turned down more than half
[1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:35.540]  the sponsors that come to us when other people will accept anything and I'm not
[1:41:35.540 --> 1:41:38.380]  bashing folks I know we've got an important message to get out a lot of
[1:41:38.380 --> 1:41:42.780]  people I'm not here judging the point is we have high moral standards and that's
[1:41:42.780 --> 1:41:47.580]  why I wanted to come back online today and just point out that we've been right
[1:41:47.580 --> 1:41:51.500]  about everything unfortunately I wish I was wrong but it's not tooting my horn
[1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:54.900]  the globalists admitted this in all their own documents but we had the courage
[1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:58.460]  to stand up and say things that were unpopular because our children and our
[1:41:58.460 --> 1:42:02.060]  grandchildren mattered and because the truth is what matters and standing in
[1:42:02.060 --> 1:42:07.700]  tyranny is what matters now I told you my goal when it was 280 bucks when it was
[1:42:07.700 --> 1:42:11.260]  300 when it was 400 when it was 500 when it was 600 when it was 700 when it was
[1:42:11.260 --> 1:42:16.900]  800 when it was 900 when it was a thousand now it's a thousand sixty and
[1:42:16.900 --> 1:42:20.300]  climbing in fact I was talking to Teddy said it's going up even more it's
[1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:24.620]  getting insane now I'm sure they'll try to drive it back down but the new law
[1:42:24.620 --> 1:42:28.180]  will be a thousand twenty and then we'll go to a thousand two hundred then
[1:42:28.180 --> 1:42:30.820]  they'll drive it down to a thousand one hundred then it'll be a thousand three
[1:42:30.820 --> 1:42:34.240]  hundred then they'll drive it down to a thousand 200 it'll be a thousand four
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:37.440]  hundred then will drive it down to a thousand three hundred back and forth
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:42.520]  But if you look at the seven-year trend, the eight-year trend, it's going straight up.
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:44.720]  It's more than tripled.
[1:42:44.720 --> 1:42:45.720]  It's almost quadrupled.
[1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:50.280]  If it continues in a month, it would have quadrupled in eight years.
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:52.520]  No other investment is doing that.
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:43:00.120]  And the reason we told you to get gold earlier was because we're not idiots, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:05.880]  It's not the Russians and the Chinese and all these people that are devaluing the dollar.
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:10.680]  The Russians and the Chinese and the Indians have been allowed into the G-15 into the UN
[1:43:10.680 --> 1:43:15.600]  Security Council because they've been fully taken over by the New World Order.
[1:43:15.600 --> 1:43:18.040]  Decades ago, there was only six members and then eight members.
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:21.760]  They only allowed countries that are fully controlled by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers
[1:43:21.760 --> 1:43:26.200]  and Saxe-Coburg-Gothas to be in there.
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:27.200]  Okay?
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.200]  This is key.
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:33.880]  And so when you hear China and that the Arabs are doing this, no, they've been begging
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:40.400]  for five years for the West to stop issuing tens of trillions of the M3 money supply every
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.520]  year and devaluing their investments when their number one investment is US dollars.
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:49.680]  And they've begged and they've pleaded and they've been told, no, we're going to devalue
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:51.160]  the dollar incrementally.
[1:43:51.160 --> 1:43:55.640]  So they're publicly saying that they all write this in their newspapers.
[1:43:55.640 --> 1:43:59.400]  They're saying, look, your private banks are swindling you and swindling us.
[1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:01.000]  This is the New World Order.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.360]  And if you're going to go ahead and destroy the US, we're not going down with you.
[1:44:05.360 --> 1:44:06.520]  So understand that.
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:09.240]  In the end, they're going to bomb the Arabs and say they did it.
[1:44:09.240 --> 1:44:11.000]  In the end, they're going to say the Chinese did it.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:15.680]  They've got a new red dawn coming out where the Chinese do economic warfare and people
[1:44:15.680 --> 1:44:16.680]  will believe that.
[1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:18.680]  And the media is going to blame the Chinese.
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:20.280]  You want to blame the New World Order.
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:21.880]  You want to blame Bernanke.
[1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:23.720]  You want to blame the Rockefellers.
[1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:25.080]  You want to blame Geithner.
[1:44:25.080 --> 1:44:26.960]  You want to blame Larry Summers.
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:32.680]  We want to blame the people we document in the Obama deception and fall the Republic.
[1:44:32.680 --> 1:44:39.240]  Our lives depend on it because if they are able to stage events and pose as saviors again,
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:41.640]  they're going to bring us into an even greater tyranny.
[1:44:41.640 --> 1:44:43.280]  They want to lower our standard of living.
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:45.840]  They want to destroy our industrial society.
[1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:50.960]  And as bad a situation we're in, as good a job they've done of wrecking our society,
[1:44:50.960 --> 1:44:52.480]  they haven't even gotten started yet.
[1:44:52.480 --> 1:44:57.760]  So look, in a few minutes we've got left here before Dave Mustaine comes up, I want to bring
[1:44:57.760 --> 1:44:58.760]  Ted Anderson up.
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:01.480]  I'm going to bring him into the next segment too and then Dave Mustaine.
[1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:04.320]  I'm going to go ahead and go to just the end of this hour with him.
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:05.320]  Ted Anderson is there waiting.
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:08.840]  He's got a bunch of news articles and a bunch of documentation, but I want to be very clear
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:09.840]  about this.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:13.560]  This is a sad day that we're right about gold.
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:17.720]  But Ted still has the offer from yesterday at $9.94.
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:19.640]  He had it at $9.90, but that's sold out.
[1:45:19.640 --> 1:45:20.640]  He has $9.94.
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:23.840]  That's when he bought this gold and silver in the market.
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:27.880]  It's now skyrocketed and this is going to run out again tonight.
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:31.280]  And Ted is here to tell us tomorrow, he's still going to have another great deal, but
[1:45:31.280 --> 1:45:35.080]  it'll probably be about $1,000 in the market from what he's bought because Ted's been
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:39.400]  buying as it goes down and then he sells it cheap when the market goes up.
[1:45:39.400 --> 1:45:41.920]  Ted Anderson, what is gold doing right now?
[1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:48.840]  Well, like you said, Alex, gold has gone over 1,060, it's at 1,062 at its peak today, currently
[1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:51.960]  right now at 1,054.70.
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:57.160]  So we're seeing new highs that we've never seen before in gold and the market is hot.
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:46:01.040]  And like you said, I mean, I was just looking through, you know, all the different news
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:07.320]  services out there that I could find, Bloomberg right now is talking about going up, Dan Burroughs
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:10.360]  right now is talking about gold at 2,225.
[1:46:10.360 --> 1:46:13.280]  Yeah, CNBC is saying 2,000.
[1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:14.280]  Yeah.
[1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:18.120]  Richard Russell, I'm looking at Gary North right now, Gary North is talking about gold
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:19.120]  going up.
[1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:23.720]  There's been a divorce between Arab oil and the United States dollar.
[1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:27.360]  And that's one of the few things that supported the United States dollar like it has.
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:31.560]  You've covered that issue how many times on your show over the last year, year and a half,
[1:46:31.560 --> 1:46:32.560]  two years.
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:37.760]  And that separation from the Arab oil and the dollar is going to be devastating to the
[1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:43.400]  United States dollar that it's like one of the last few footholds that foreigners have
[1:46:43.400 --> 1:46:46.880]  to hold on to US American currency is reserve.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:49.760]  And that stuff is going to be sold into the marketplace.
[1:46:49.760 --> 1:46:53.680]  And I wish I could tell you that again, that you're wrong about this banking thing, but
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:55.520]  you're dead on right.
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:01.560]  There is a national, there's a worldwide banking cartel that is really trying to take
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:05.200]  over what was value in the United States.
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.440]  We'd be standing on our own right now if we had constitutional money, but we haven't.
[1:47:09.440 --> 1:47:13.040]  We turned it over to this Federal Reserve system and now they're turning it over to
[1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:17.840]  this world banking system, and the United States is losing a war that they don't even
[1:47:17.840 --> 1:47:19.720]  know that they're engaged in.
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:21.240]  Absolutely, Ted.
[1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:25.040]  And just like these private banks write books about how they go in and buy off third-world
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:30.760]  countries, pay the dictators or corrupt political legislatures to not pay the money back, they're
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:36.480]  now going into the States, putting more federal mandates on them, and then the private banks
[1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:43.280]  are loaning US stimulus funds to the States, so they take the money from the States, give
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:46.200]  it to private banks, and then they loan it.
[1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:52.760]  Some states are paying as high as 20% compounding interest, loan, sharking levels, and this
[1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:53.760]  is it.
[1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:58.800]  They're finally totally bankrupting us, tapping us out, while at the same time deploying troops
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:05.000]  inside the US, they plan on absolutely gutting us.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.200]  And folks, all I can say is, I hope you get into gold right now.
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:18.000]  I hope you call 1-800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237, because at least we grab a little bit of
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:20.000]  victory from the jaws of defeat.
[1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.320]  The bankers are taking over, they're raping everything, they're kidnapping our kids, they're
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:27.800]  poisoning the vaccines, they're enjoying themselves, they're having their world government, but
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:34.160]  at least patriots and people that know about the New World Order have seen triple profits,
[1:48:34.160 --> 1:48:38.240]  and at least people can protect themselves by getting into gold and silver, and at least
[1:48:38.240 --> 1:48:45.240]  the listeners here can get gold factored into the market at a market that was $994 versus
[1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:48.240]  $1,059-56.
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:55.280]  The point here is, Ted has got the sovereigns, the gold sovereigns, the gorgeous gold sovereigns,
[1:48:55.280 --> 1:49:01.240]  he's got the Franks, the Swiss, the French Franks, some other Franks, it's a European
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:02.240]  unit.
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:06.800]  He's got the silver half dollars, Ted, tell them about the coins, tell them about the
[1:49:06.800 --> 1:49:07.800]  offer.
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:08.800]  Yeah, sure.
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:12.400]  I mean, the British sovereign we're carrying right now is at $291, the Franks currently
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:22.440]  are at $236, the walking Liberty halves right now are $8.69, Franks, you can go in and take
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:27.800]  a look at the, go to infowars.com, they haven't changed the price on the Lakota Nation coin,
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:34.160]  it's still at $22.30, I mean, we're almost looking at $18 silver now, we're looking
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:45.360]  at gold at $1,050 plus, Alex, that's a run, gold is going to shoot through $1,060 and
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:46.360]  then $1,070.
[1:49:46.360 --> 1:49:51.240]  Well, Ted, let's just be clear on this, let's be clear on this, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:57.120]  but you told me this yesterday off here, you are paying yourself wholesale, a huge wholesaler,
[1:49:57.120 --> 1:50:01.440]  a huge buyer, you are paying more for these gold and silver coins now when you're buying
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:04.200]  them than for what you're selling them to people.
[1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:11.680]  Yeah, right now we are paying less, we're paying more than what I can sell them for
[1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:16.200]  at this particular time because the market has gone up that particular, the market has
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:17.200]  gone up that much.
[1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:21.480]  I understand, Ted is a wholesaler, cannot get the deal, he's about to offer you, how
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:22.480]  is he doing that?
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.800]  Because he bought it when it was low and he's keeping the tiny markup he had from when gold
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:33.320]  was $60 something less than it is now, that's how he's passing this on, that's how you're
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:42.440]  getting this deal, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, Ted, I want to come back with one more second
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:47.200]  before Dave Mustaine on this October 8th live Thursday edition and talk about what it will
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:51:01.840]  look like as the dollar dies.

[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:02.440]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:03.440]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:09.440]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:11.440]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:14.440]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:19.440]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR.
[1:52:19.440 --> 1:52:25.440]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.440]  to grow at our own door.
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:33.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:36.440]  An inside job?
[1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:40.440]  How dare you?
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.440]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.440 --> 1:52:46.440]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:52.440]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:52:52.440 --> 1:52:58.440]  Please rise and download the film at www.prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.

[1:54:08.440 --> 1:54:10.440]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:17.440]  It is October 8, 2009 on this Thursday edition.
[1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:21.440]  And just to be clear here, we are seeing the fall of republic.
[1:54:21.440 --> 1:54:28.440]  First, they had to take the greatest industrial nation, the greatest manufacturing nation, the greatest saving nation.
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:31.440]  And now look, the man and woman both got to work two jobs.
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:33.440]  The average person is at deep, deep debt.
[1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:37.440]  We have the greatest debt ratio of any society in history, even greater than the Great Depression.
[1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:41.440]  The bankers are now making their move with the paramilitary forces on us.
[1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:43.440]  They're now locking everything down.
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:45.440]  They're now making announcements to spy on your neighbors.
[1:54:45.440 --> 1:54:49.440]  They're going to pay people to be spies, to be thugs.
[1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:51.440]  The whole economy is going to be present.
[1:54:51.440 --> 1:54:53.440]  It's going to be really, really rough, folks.
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:56.440]  I just want you to know this is real tyranny we're facing.
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:55:00.440]  And if we don't bring the bankers to justice, they're not going to give us quarter.
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:02.440]  They're not going to back off. They're not going to quit.
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:07.440]  The bare minimum we can do is get out of their fiat currency and the stock markets before they hammer us too bad.
[1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:09.440]  The dollar is plunging right now.
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:11.440]  And again, this is inexperable.
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:13.440]  The bankers made the decision to do this.
[1:55:13.440 --> 1:55:16.440]  They make the profits while everybody else are suckers.
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:18.440]  Well, now the world is getting out of it.
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:20.440]  Ted, what will it look like as the dollar dies?
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:24.440]  Incremental versus a climactic plunge?
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  Well, I would say it's going to be incremental, but it already has been incremental.
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:31.440]  We only have about two cents of the value left in the dollar.
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:33.440]  You know what it's going to be like?
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:35.440]  It's going to be like what I've seen in Argentina,
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:41.440]  where I saw a mom and dad and a couple of kids huddled up in a blanket in a store shop door
[1:55:41.440 --> 1:55:46.440]  while it's freezing rain, not freezing rain, but sleeting outside,
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:50.440]  you know, misting, and they're trying to stay warm.
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:53.440]  That's the kind of thing that we're looking at here in the United States.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:54.440]  Unfortunately...
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:57.440]  They were a first world nation before the bankers did the exact same thing.
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:55:59.440]  I've been on their TV and radio. They all know it as well.
[1:55:59.440 --> 1:56:02.440]  They did exactly what we were doing.
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:04.440]  We allowed ourselves to get in way too much debt.
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:06.440]  We lived on economic times.
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:08.440]  Our prosperity was handed to us.
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:10.440]  And it all made up by these bankers.
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:12.440]  These bankers just suckered us in.
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.440]  That's exactly right.
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:19.440]  We got suckered into a system that forces us to take on debt in order to have commerce.
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:24.440]  And that has just been compounding against us since 1913.
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:28.440]  And now the solution to the problem is to put us into a fiat currency system
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:32.440]  where we now have to serve us interest on debt to a world bank
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:34.440]  rather than our own national bank.
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:35.440]  Absolutely.
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:37.440]  And in closing, Ted, I wanted to add this point.
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  I never got to it yesterday.
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:40.440]  But Sunday or Monday, I'm going to play the video.
[1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:45.440]  It's up on PrismPlanet.com. John Elway has put out a Homeland Security training video
[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:51.440]  where he says if somebody owns gold or they have guns, call Homeland Security on them.
[1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:53.440]  They say that's a sign of terror.
[1:56:53.440 --> 1:56:59.440]  I mean, this government, they say in the MYAC report, if you support Ron Paul,
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:02.440]  folks, the government's rogue. It's criminal.
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:05.440]  And they're going to have celebrities tell you, Terran, he's good.
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:07.440]  Remember, the bankers did this to you.
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:12.440]  I'm telling you, folks, I feel so good pushing this deal that Ted's offering and supporting him
[1:57:12.440 --> 1:57:15.440]  after all he's done for this network and this country.
[1:57:15.440 --> 1:57:17.440]  Ted is giving you such an incredible deal.
[1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:19.440]  People really ought to be thinking him.
[1:57:19.440 --> 1:57:23.440]  And you've got to tell him, Alex Jones sent you, that's the Ted Anderson, Alex Jones special,
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:28.440]  where you're going to be paying the $1,000, $50-something price per ounce of gold.
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:34.440]  Ted has it right now, ladies and gentlemen, at the 94 level.
[1:57:34.440 --> 1:57:38.440]  Give him a call, 800-686-2237.
[1:57:38.440 --> 1:57:41.440]  800-686-2237.
[1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:43.440]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:45.440]  I mean, this is yesterday's deal.
[1:57:45.440 --> 1:57:49.440]  Well, you know, we keep on talking about this every time we come to the end of our interview,
[1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:53.440]  but I'm going to hold it until midnight tonight just because I've given you my word.
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:55.440]  I'm going to sell it to you at this price.
[1:57:55.440 --> 1:58:00.440]  And I know people like to pick up your show on the podcast and they'll be listening later on.
[1:58:00.440 --> 1:58:04.440]  So call us, if you're calling us on October 8th, you'll get this deal.
[1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:08.440]  Gold just ran over $1,060 an ounce.
[1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:11.440]  Obviously, it's not going to hold for very long because I can't do it.
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:13.440]  I'm not, you know, prices are going to go up on me.
[1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:15.440]  I have to raise my prices.
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:17.440]  800-686-2237.
[1:58:17.440 --> 1:58:19.440]  800-686-2237.
[1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:21.440]  You ought to be kissing Ted.
[1:58:21.440 --> 1:58:29.440]  Imagine kissing him, you know, inside your mind's eye right now because this is a great deal.
[1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:31.440]  Check out other deals while you can.
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:33.440]  Most people are running out of gold.
[1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:34.440]  Dave Mustaine's coming up.
[1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:35.440]  Thank you so much, Ted.
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:37.440]  Even though they're taking over our country, at least you're doing something good.
[1:58:37.440 --> 1:58:39.440]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[1:58:43.440 --> 1:58:45.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:45.440 --> 1:59:10.440]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:25.440]  Welcome to GCNLive.com.
[1:59:45.440 --> 1:59:54.440]  Welcome to GCNLive.com.
[1:59:54.440 --> 2:00:06.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:06.440 --> 2:00:11.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:11.440 --> 2:00:13.440]  You want answers?
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:18.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:26.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:31.440]  We are going to continue to cover the G20 Open World Government being announced.
[2:00:31.440 --> 2:00:39.440]  Barack Obama is the first U.S. president to sit as the chairman of the United Nations Security Council, the 15 member.
[2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:43.440]  That's the only group that can really vote and has power.
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:45.440]  The General Assembly has no power.
[2:00:45.440 --> 2:00:50.440]  CNN called him president of the world, and he was shaking when he gabbled it in two days ago.
[2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:52.440]  Shaking with pleasure.
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:56.440]  U.S. Ambassador Rice behind him was shaking.
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:00:59.440]  Henry Kissinger was shaking in the audience.
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:05.440]  This is the New World Order, the eugenics world government now coming into fruition.
[2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:10.440]  We are joined by Dave Mustaine, the founder and lead guitarist and lead singer of Megadeth.
[2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.440]  Guitarist, lead singer of Megadeth, megadeth.com.
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:26.440]  The new album is in-game, and I just want to say that growing up, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 today, I have always loved Megadeth because the lyrics.
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:31.440]  I didn't even really understand them when I was 12, 14, 15 years old, 20 years old.
[2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:35.440]  Because I learned about the New World Order, the eugenics, the master plan.
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:38.440]  It really did influence me, and I didn't even realize how much it did.
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  A man way before his time understanding what was coming, most of their covers are about the UN and world government.
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:48.440]  And now it's all happening. Dave Mustaine joining us. Thank you so much, sir.
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:50.440]  You're welcome, Alex.
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:54.440]  What do you think about what's happening, world government being announced?
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:59.440]  It's pretty frightening. I have to be really careful when I do my interviews and talk about a lot of stuff.
[2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:05.440]  Because you have to be objective, and you have to give people the right to think out of the box.
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.440]  But I think you and I agree on a lot of things.
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  And especially, I want to tell you thanks for inspiring me to look into the whole end-game film.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:22.440]  And I actually had discovered this document through watching an inspirational video.
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:29.440]  And I know we've spoken before, and that was a privilege for me, because I believe you're a patriot.
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:33.440]  And I think our country needs more people like you.
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:46.440]  And as far as having our record called end-game, I think it's the best way to thank somebody used to bring credit where credit's due.
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:47.440]  So thanks.
[2:02:47.440 --> 2:02:54.440]  Well, thank you, Dave. Listen, that's just amazing that you influenced me.
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:59.440]  And then now with my research, I've influenced you. It's kind of the circle is complete.
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:03.440]  Almost. Now we just need one big boom.
[2:03:03.440 --> 2:03:09.440]  Well, I tell you, I mean, my wife is freaked out because she researches all this, and she says it's happening.
[2:03:09.440 --> 2:03:13.440]  It's world government, world taxes, world carbon taxes.
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.440]  We're going to go to break in a moment and some stations join us.
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:26.440]  But Dave, tell us about the new record that's already, from what I've seen in the news, exploding up the charts end-game.
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:32.440]  Well, the new record we have recorded in a studio that I own in San Marcos, California.
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:36.440]  I moved back to San Diego after the lawsuit with Ellison.
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:39.440]  I just didn't want to be in the same city with them, so we moved.
[2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:48.440]  And then when I started doing this record, of course, I have a real free world kind of thinking with my lyrics and stuff.
[2:03:48.440 --> 2:03:56.440]  So it was just going to be more of the same with this record, just continuing my idea to raise awareness and to help people think.
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:04:01.440]  I may not be right, but I'm certainly right to inspire people to question.
[2:04:01.440 --> 2:04:07.440]  And this record has a lot of topics, and it talks about the collapse of the financial institutions.
[2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:13.440]  You know, I went to school and I got licensed by the state and federal government to work on Wall Street as a stockbroker.
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:19.440]  And I figured, you know, being in the music business, most people in the music business aren't very smart when it comes to their money.
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:22.440]  So I wanted to be smart and educate myself about that.
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  And along the way, you learn so much, the more that you're willing to exercise your brain, the more that you discover that it's just frightening.
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:37.440]  You know, watching the zeitgeist quits and then, you know, knowing all the stuff that's going on with the marrow and so on and so forth.
[2:04:37.440 --> 2:04:43.440]  You know, these are all things that are pretty, you know, pretty atypical conspiracy theories and stuff.
[2:04:43.440 --> 2:04:48.440]  But I mean, if you really think that just one second you say, OK, maybe this isn't a conspiracy.
[2:04:48.440 --> 2:04:53.440]  Dave, we've got a break. We've got a break. The satellite makes us break. Stay right there.
[2:04:53.440 --> 2:05:00.440]  Right back with Dave Mustaine, the founder of Megadeth. Stay with us.
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:26.440]  I like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home.
[2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:31.440]  Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling.
[2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:38.440]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:40.440]  When the power goes out, you'll be ready.
[2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:48.440]  With a solar power generator from Solution from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today.
[2:05:48.440 --> 2:06:00.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[2:06:18.440 --> 2:06:24.440]  What you do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times.

[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:33.440]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well.
[2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:37.440]  You know the government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself.
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:40.440]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:06:40.440 --> 2:06:44.440]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[2:06:44.440 --> 2:06:51.440]  Go to here'swhatyoudo.net and start today. Again, it is here's what you do.net.

[2:07:01.440 --> 2:07:04.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:09.440]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:14.440]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[2:07:14.440 --> 2:07:18.440]  Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[2:07:18.440 --> 2:07:21.440]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:26.440]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:31.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:35.440]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:39.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[2:07:39.440 --> 2:07:43.440]  How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get.
[2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:47.440]  I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[2:07:47.440 --> 2:07:55.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:08:06.440]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:30.440]  In control.
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:37.440]  Watch him become a guy.
[2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:43.440]  Watch people's heads roll.
[2:08:43.440 --> 2:08:46.440]  Roll.
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:54.440]  Roll.
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:58.440]  Just like the viper.
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:01.440]  Then rats through the streets.
[2:09:01.440 --> 2:09:04.440]  Dancing like a marionette.
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:09.440]  Swaying to the symphony of destruction.
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  I'm gonna start a head banging here in a minute.
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:16.440]  Wackin' like a robot.
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:21.440]  Dave, I listened to that song. What did that come out in the early 1990s?
[2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:25.440]  Yeah, that was on countdown to extinction.
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:32.440]  And now you watch as the president is the head of the UN Security Council and the president,
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:39.440]  and they're openly announcing world government. How did you know all of this 15 years ago?
[2:09:39.440 --> 2:09:44.440]  I don't know. I did lucky guess maybe.
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:51.440]  You're paying attention to the news, listening to people like yourself, other people who are thinking for themselves,
[2:09:51.440 --> 2:09:57.440]  and they're not being led off the slaughter like mindless sheep.
[2:09:57.440 --> 2:10:04.440]  Amazing. Some stations just joined us. Dave Mustaine, the founder and guitarist and lead singer of megadeth.com,
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:07.440]  is the website. A lot about the band, what's happening, what's going on.
[2:10:07.440 --> 2:10:12.440]  But you got interrupted by the break. Let's get back into what influenced your new, very popular,
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:18.440]  Out of the Gates just released album in-game, and you were getting into how they try to call us conspiracy theorists,
[2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:21.440]  but it's all now being announced. Dave Mustaine.
[2:10:21.440 --> 2:10:27.440]  It's really easy for people whenever you talk about things that are controversial in nature for people to sit on the sidelines
[2:10:27.440 --> 2:10:31.440]  and point their fingers. So when anybody says anything that's controversial in nature,
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:35.440]  especially stuff that has to do with our government or any of the administration,
[2:10:35.440 --> 2:10:43.440]  what do they say? It's anti-patriotic, or they say that you're just a nut job and to be even more insulting.
[2:10:43.440 --> 2:10:49.440]  Our nation was founded on people who think outside of the box, people who question the word,
[2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:54.440]  people who looked at things and said, you know what, I don't agree with this.
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.440]  Well, it certainly was. The cover of in-game, a lot of people email me saying, what is it?
[2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:05.440]  And I go, well, it's totally clear. It's a bunch of, tell me if I'm wrong, like zombie slaves and concentration camp uniforms
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:11.440]  being marched off towards a pyramidal light and their stacks of the FEMA coffins
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:16.440]  that have been deployed all over the country at depots.
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:21.440]  And there's a bunch of flies basically feeding on the death surrounding it.
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:23.440]  Is that an accurate breakdown of the cover?
[2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:27.440]  That's really, really, really close. Everything that you said is accurate.
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:31.440]  There's a little bit more symbology there that you might not have noticed.
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:38.440]  A lot of the biblical stuff, like with the parting of the Red Sea and the people going through,
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:41.440]  there's also the barcode that's on their heads.
[2:11:41.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  If you look closely inside of the album cover, it has a larger picture,
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:51.440]  but if you look closely on the cover, there's what appears to be a mohawk going up the back of these guys head.
[2:11:51.440 --> 2:11:55.440]  That's not what it is. When you get inside of the cover and you look at it, it's the barcode,
[2:11:55.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  because they say nothing can be bought or sold without the mark,
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:03.440]  and it's going to be on your hand in your forehead, but nobody said it's going to go left to right.
[2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:05.440]  How about if it's fashionable like a mohawk?
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:11.440]  And then the thing with the flies on the outside and the way that they're just waiting,
[2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:16.440]  that was one of the plagues that happened to Egypt.
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:21.440]  One of the biblical plagues, and I see it, they've got barcodes on the backs of their heads.
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:27.440]  They're in Gitmo orange jumpsuits marching in what looks like a mass grave.
[2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:31.440]  And they're going through the Red Sea of those black FEMA costumes,
[2:12:31.440 --> 2:12:37.440]  but those are the walls of the black sleeping hell back.
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:39.440]  Well, there you have it from Dave Mustaine.
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:44.440]  And am I right to say that it kind of nexuses at a paramount point,
[2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:52.440]  like the eye of Lucifer or the eye of Satan that is energizing this scene?
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:54.440]  Wow, that's pretty heavy.
[2:12:54.440 --> 2:12:59.440]  No, we didn't, I didn't go that deep with that particular part of it.
[2:12:59.440 --> 2:13:03.440]  There is a light that they're heading to at the end, but it was more kind of like a,
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:09.440]  I don't know, if the eye of Oris or whatever, that kind of whole stargate kind of thing
[2:13:09.440 --> 2:13:13.440]  where they live in the light, you know what I mean?
[2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:15.440]  It was just something that they were walking to.
[2:13:15.440 --> 2:13:19.440]  And it was just something that we had, in blind faith, they're walking to,
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:23.440]  and we don't even realize what we're walking through.
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:26.440]  Absolutely. Wow, what a heavy cover.
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:29.440]  And I've seen, you know, doing some research for this interview,
[2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:33.440]  and also checking the album out, all these people speculating what it is,
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:37.440]  and I looked at it immediately and said, yeah, those are people marching to their death,
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:41.440]  but amazing.
[2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:45.440]  Tell us about some of the songs in the album.
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:49.440]  Okay, the album starts off with the classic guitar duel.
[2:13:49.440 --> 2:13:53.440]  I think a lot of your listeners will really dig the lyrics on this record,
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:55.440]  but there's also a lot of great guitar work.
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:13:59.440]  Guitar players have become very satisfied because heavy metal in America,
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:05.440]  it peaked in the 90s when all the hair bands came out and it lost its integrity to a lot of people,
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:08.440]  and it went underground, and now it's making a resurgence.
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:11.440]  They came through a period where they wouldn't even do a guitar solo.
[2:14:11.440 --> 2:14:15.440]  This record is full of guitar solos.
[2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:18.440]  And we start off with an instrumental that's just, you know,
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:21.440]  the lobby of guitar solos back and forth to each other,
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:24.440]  or volleying the back and forth with me and the other guitar player.
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:27.440]  And the next song is called This Day We Fight,
[2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:32.440]  which is influenced by the war speech that Aragon gave,
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:36.440]  or whatever his name is, and Lord of the Rings.
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:39.440]  You know, saying that, hey, man, we may die tomorrow,
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:41.440]  but we're not going to die today because this day we're going to fight,
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:43.440]  and we're going to kick butt, and we're going to take down names,
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:45.440]  and that's how it's been for us.
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:47.440]  You know, we've really had to fight an uphill battle,
[2:14:47.440 --> 2:14:49.440]  but it really seems like the warms turn.
[2:14:49.440 --> 2:14:53.440]  Websites like Glabbermouth that have hated me since the day that they started
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:55.440]  gave us some A.5 on our new record,
[2:14:55.440 --> 2:15:00.440]  and they said that it's time for them to pay attention to Professor Dave,
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:02.440]  and I'm thinking, what?
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:05.440]  You know, this is a website that whenever I would say anything,
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:09.440]  they would post a story about it and slam me.
[2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:13.440]  So, you know, it's amazing the way that everything has turned around right now for us,
[2:15:13.440 --> 2:15:15.440]  for me, just sticking to my guns, too,
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:19.440]  because there was a period where a lot of heavy metal bands reinvented themselves.
[2:15:19.440 --> 2:15:22.440]  So, then we go into different songs, like 1320's,
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:26.440]  the song about drag racing and the National Hot Rod Association loves the song.
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:28.440]  We've got a song called Forty-Four Minutes,
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:32.440]  which is about the North Hollywood bank robbery that happened back in the 90s,
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:36.440]  and, you know, of course, the title track,
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:41.440]  which is about the document that I discovered that our former president had signed,
[2:15:41.440 --> 2:15:47.440]  that, you know, it was brought to my attention by searching the web, knowing who you are,
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:51.440]  and also seeing the part that you'd posted about Lou Dobbs,
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:53.440]  because I really respect that guy,
[2:15:53.440 --> 2:15:56.440]  and I thought, you know, there's just something really wrong about this,
[2:15:56.440 --> 2:15:58.440]  and I looked into it, and I thought, that's it.
[2:15:58.440 --> 2:16:03.440]  I'm going to sing a song about this, because it's perfect, it completely predicts,
[2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:05.440]  because I read 1984 when I was just a kid,
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:09.440]  and I've got so many songs about this, like, what could bounce us about that.
[2:16:09.440 --> 2:16:12.440]  There was a whole bunch of stuff that talks about this future world
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  that we're just blindly marching into.
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:19.440]  Well, we certainly are blindly marching in.
[2:16:19.440 --> 2:16:24.440]  We have video and photos of neighborhoods with no one even protesting,
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:27.440]  with the Pittsburgh police in Pennsylvania saying for the G20,
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:30.440]  no one's allowed to congregate, no one's allowed to be on the street.
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:34.440]  They say, flee, flee, and then they turn on the sound cannons.
[2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440]  They hit my employees with it.
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:40.440]  We've got video of them walking up to women and Billy clubbing them in the head.
[2:16:40.440 --> 2:16:42.440]  Video, pardon me?
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:44.440]  I said, oh my God.
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:45.440]  Oh, no, it's incredible.
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:47.440]  We've got video, in fact, we'll play some of it in the background
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:50.440]  for people watching at prisonplanet.tv, not just on the radio,
[2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:54.440]  of the military pulling up and grabbing peaceful protesters,
[2:16:54.440 --> 2:16:59.440]  snatching and grabbing and cramming them into unmarked police cars, the military.
[2:16:59.440 --> 2:17:02.440]  I mean, so they're not only announcing the world government and the world tax
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:07.440]  and Obama is now a dual president in the U.N. and the U.S.
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:11.440]  as the chairman of the Security Council, but now the military's,
[2:17:11.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  I mean, it's like they want us to know that they're in control.
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.440]  Yeah, I think so, huh?
[2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:21.440]  Wow.
[2:17:21.440 --> 2:17:23.440]  That's so sad.
[2:17:23.440 --> 2:17:28.440]  I guess you take a mortal man, you put him in control, watch him become a God.
[2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:29.440]  That's right.
[2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:32.440]  And these things, you know, I've been talking about them forever.
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:35.440]  As long as I can write music, I've been talking about stuff like this.
[2:17:35.440 --> 2:17:38.440]  It didn't really get to a point where people would, you know,
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:40.440]  really take anything that I said seriously.
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  I mean, imagine what it's like for these poor guys that sing songs about dragons.
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:47.440]  Well, exactly.
[2:17:47.440 --> 2:17:51.440]  But I mean, again, I've gone over the years and read your lyrics again,
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:55.440]  and it just rung true when I was 20 years ago.
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:59.440]  I mean, I've been listening to Megadeth since it started when I was about 12
[2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:01.440]  and when you started it.
[2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:04.440]  And I was like, I don't know.
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:08.440]  It was always probably my favorite, if not my favorite heavy metal bag.
[2:18:08.440 --> 2:18:11.440]  I like the speed metal and everything in the mix and the different.
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:13.440]  And I like the fact that you're not fake.
[2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:14.440]  You've never changed.
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:18.440]  I mean, you've expanded and grown, but it's never changed.
[2:18:18.440 --> 2:18:23.440]  You're not changing your hairstyle or acting silly or or trying, you know,
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  I mean, you're doing what you want to do being authentic.
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:31.440]  And I think that really underlines what what you've done with Megadeth.
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:35.440]  Well, I think that's a very American way to, you know, just to be true to yourself
[2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:38.440]  and, you know, stand up for what you believe in.
[2:18:38.440 --> 2:18:42.440]  You know, it's hard for people to really stand up for what they believe in anymore,
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:47.440]  because, you know, if you do something like that, they'll they'll vilify you.
[2:18:47.440 --> 2:18:51.440]  If you're doing anything that isn't status quo, you know.
[2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:55.440]  Yeah, it was hard to in the very beginning to be open about my life,
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:00.440]  the problems I had and to be open about, you know, the band and problems we had.
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  And, you know, people were were not responding to that very well.
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:09.440]  But now at this point, I can always say that, you know, I've been serious at the beginning.
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:14.440]  You see these other guys that do these image makeovers and go from one band where they're dressed like,
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:18.440]  you know, they find man for change addiction and then the next band they're in there,
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:21.440]  you know, in some biker band.
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:25.440]  And it's like, how can you, how can you convince, how can you spell that?
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:31.440]  How can you convince that, you know, your fans are the following that one day you can be an androgynous space queen
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:37.440]  and the next day you can be, you know, the spawn of the big red machine, you know.
[2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:43.440]  Well, again, you have been anti-New World Order, anti-global government.
[2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:46.440]  How long has Megadeth been around 21 years longer?
[2:19:46.440 --> 2:19:50.440]  Yeah, it's been a little close to 25 years.
[2:19:50.440 --> 2:19:56.440]  When we started, it took a little time until we got the first lineup and went into the studio to record that happen.
[2:19:56.440 --> 2:20:00.440]  Stay there, Dave. Got to break again. Sorry to cut you off. We'll be right back. Amazing. Dave Mustaine.
[2:20:00.440 --> 2:20:05.440]  For thousands of years, Native American healing has been practiced in North America.
[2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:09.440]  The Native Americans discovered an astonishing healing plant called Siaga.
[2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.440]  This pesticide-free, wild-crafted, all-natural wonder is hand-picked by a medicine man
[2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:20.440]  and effectively combined with other all-natural and sacred ingredients into a product called defense.

[2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:04.440]  Gold isn't for you? Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources.
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:08.440]  One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it.
[2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:12.440]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:16.440]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy
[2:21:16.440 --> 2:21:19.440]  that social security would be there for you. That's not what's happening.
[2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:24.440]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[2:21:24.440 --> 2:21:28.440]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure.
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:31.440]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:35.440]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:41.440]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:46.440]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should, too.
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:50.440]  Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:56.440]  800-686-2237.
[2:21:56.440 --> 2:22:01.440]  That's 800-686-2237.
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:05.440]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:22:05.440 --> 2:22:10.440]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:13.440]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:16.440]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:22:16.440 --> 2:22:19.440]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:22.440]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:22:22.440 --> 2:22:27.440]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:35.440]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:39.440]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:42.440]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:45.440]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:47.440]  They're after power. That's their after-easy.

[2:22:56.440 --> 2:23:18.440]  We've had more bank failures this year than the previous 10 years combined.

[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:09.720]  Hey!
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:26.760]  Hey!
[2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:28.760]  Wake up people!
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:02.760]  Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Here the whole song, the whole album at Megadeth.com.
[2:26:02.760 --> 2:26:13.760]  M-E-G-A-D-E-T-H.com. Or just Google Megadeth. The term end game. Get it at iTunes. Get the CD. Get it all at Megadeth.com.
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:19.760]  We need to support this type of message. Megadeth is up there at the very top of heavy metal, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:22.760]  And these folks at PAX stadiums across the planet.
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:27.760]  We need this anti-New World Order message now more than ever to warn people.
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  Whatever is going to happen with the New World Order, whatever this global system is going to do, we have to stand and resist it.
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:37.760]  And the clergy response teams have been hired by the feds to tell their flocks to not stand up and not resist.
[2:26:37.760 --> 2:26:42.760]  They're going to be raptured out. Ladies and gentlemen, that is unbelievable.
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:48.760]  Dave Mustaine, I tell you, every time I hear that song since it came out last week, it just blows me away and the lyrics just get even more hard hitting.
[2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:59.760]  The RFID, the New World Order, the President. And then we played in the first hour audio of armored vehicles with sound cannons saying almost the same thing you've got in that intro.
[2:26:59.760 --> 2:27:01.760]  I mean, talk about unbelievable.
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:05.760]  Well, I'm the real American.
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:12.760]  Hell yeah, you are. And let me tell you, tens of millions of Megadeth fans worldwide are now going to finally understand.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:19.760]  They're always, why does he have the UN on the cover of his, I mean, you say my film Endgame influenced your album Endgame.
[2:27:19.760 --> 2:27:26.760]  This cover that I designed, I told the graphics person what to make was influenced by a Megadeth cover.
[2:27:26.760 --> 2:27:33.760]  Did you notice that when you saw the Endgame DVD cover that it was similar to that one where you have the UN and the flagless flagpulse?
[2:27:33.760 --> 2:27:38.760]  You know what? I know exactly what you're talking about. I never saw the correlation. That's amazing.
[2:27:38.760 --> 2:27:42.760]  But it's just crazy that you influenced me and I'm influencing you.
[2:27:42.760 --> 2:27:48.760]  Well, that's what I believe good ideas when people share stuff like that.
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:56.760]  It's a grassroots kind of thing and people, they benefit from it in a huge way when they share the truth.
[2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:59.760]  Because the truth is undeniable.
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:07.760]  In fact, that was from Peacells. Peacells, but who's buying? That's awesome.
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:14.760]  That was actually something that I saw. I got that song title from a Reader's Digest magazine.
[2:28:14.760 --> 2:28:24.760]  I was living with this girl and she went to work and I was a lazy musician, so I stayed back at her place and there was a Reader's Digest there.
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:30.760]  That's why I make fun of the magazine and the song, Sweating Bullets, why I say nice story, tell us a Reader's Digest.
[2:28:30.760 --> 2:28:38.760]  Well, yeah, because I actually read that magazine for a little while after I got the lyric, I mean the title for Peacells out of it.
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:43.760]  Interesting little book, but that's something that's really modern anymore, I guess.
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:46.760]  What did you think of my film, Endgame itself, specifically?
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:51.760]  I loved it. I thought it was great. I mean, you're very brave to go and get in the face of people like this.
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:53.760]  I guess we all have our calling.
[2:28:53.760 --> 2:28:59.760]  Dave, we're about to break in a minute long segment coming up. In fact, we will probably pull up Peacells and play some of that, but some of the new album as well.
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:05.760]  What's the best way? Where's the best place to get your new album, Endgame, and to support what you're doing?
[2:29:05.760 --> 2:29:14.760]  Well, I would say through Amazon or through iTunes, you can listen to the music in many, many places right now.
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:20.760]  MySpace and iTunes really supported us. AOLmusic.com has supported us too with this record.
[2:29:20.760 --> 2:29:26.760]  And Amazon, it's the number one record at Amazon right now and it's been that way for quite a few days.
[2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:31.760]  Number one. Endgame was number one for a few days on DVD.
[2:29:31.760 --> 2:29:36.760]  I tell you, that is incredible. Dave, we're going to break again. I want to come back and talk more about the album.
[2:29:36.760 --> 2:29:42.760]  I should have mentioned that. Endgame from Megadeth, number one in the USA, number one.
[2:29:42.760 --> 2:29:50.760]  And they're going on tour. We'll tell you about that. We'll talk more about the new order as well with Dave Mustaine, the founders, guitarist, and lead.
[2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:54.760]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.760 --> 2:30:00.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.760 --> 2:30:06.760]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[2:30:06.760 --> 2:30:15.760]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:20.760]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[2:30:20.760 --> 2:30:29.760]  Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.

[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:21.760]  Music
[2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:24.760]  Dialectic chaos. Mega death.
[2:33:24.760 --> 2:33:43.760]  Music
[2:33:43.760 --> 2:33:46.760]  Gotta control myself not to do air guitar.
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:55.760]  Break it up.
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:24.760]  Music
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:53.760]  Music
[2:34:53.760 --> 2:34:58.760]  So that's dialectic chaos from men game.
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:06.760]  That sounds like old school but with a somewhat of a new edge to it. That sounds like old school heavy metal, speed metal almost.
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:12.760]  Yeah, well that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to stick with our roots and do what we know is what we do best.
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:21.760]  There was a period during the beginning of the millennium where bands were really forced to go and change themselves.
[2:35:21.760 --> 2:35:25.760]  Not only change their image, change the way they look and stuff like that.
[2:35:25.760 --> 2:35:29.760]  But also change the way that they make their living, their music.
[2:35:29.760 --> 2:35:34.760]  They had to all get everybody needed to be like Nirvana.
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:38.760]  And I'm sorry, that was not my cup of tea.
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:44.760]  We struggled through a lot of stuff and right now it's probably the most liberated that we've been with our careers and our music.
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:48.760]  So keeping it pure, you got a new book coming out. Tell us about that.
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:53.760]  Right, it's called Hello Me, Meet the Real Me which is a lyric from Sweating Pullets.
[2:35:53.760 --> 2:35:55.760]  It had to be called that, you know that.
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:36:06.760]  And it's basically me the person, it's not just me a musician because they've written everything that could be written about me as a musician from their point of view.
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:14.760]  And some of it's true, some of it's not, some of it's folklore, some of it makes me a lot cooler than I really am so I just let him continue to think that way.
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:34.760]  With the book itself, when I got to the last page and I closed the book, I looked up, I actually was so, I was so satiated, I was so content that they finally have got my life into a book so far and that I read it and I went, you know what, I get it.
[2:36:34.760 --> 2:36:40.760]  This is it, this is it, this is it, this is how, who I am, I explained everything perfectly.
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:46.760]  And the best part about it, I think at the end of every chapter, it's like, God, you know, he did a lot of really rotten things.
[2:36:46.760 --> 2:36:58.760]  But at the end of every chapter, it tells how, you know, all those things have been made amends for, if possible, and the people that we had all these hardships with, we've gone back and worked on things.
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:07.760]  Some people were in the band that I'm friends with still, some people were in the band in the past and I'm not friends with them.
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:15.760]  Well, I tell you, I'm excited to read the new book when it comes out. Tell us about your new radio show you're launching. You're really going wild here.
[2:37:15.760 --> 2:37:32.760]  Well, you know, I mean, you've got a great platform here for you to be able to share your heart with the American people and to educate them, which is, I think, one of the highest honors in our country here is to be able to teach our children, the teachers that were there.
[2:37:32.760 --> 2:37:40.760]  Somebody's always asked me, well, what would I do if I wasn't a musician? I'd like to be a teacher. I mean, I know the page is crap and I know that you don't get any respect, but, you know, I love teaching kids.
[2:37:40.760 --> 2:37:48.760]  I used to teach martial art at this one school in Scottsdale to kids because the other teachers there weren't really good with the kids, and I loved it.
[2:37:48.760 --> 2:38:00.760]  So that's one of the things that I really enjoy doing. And watching the way that the whole music industry's kind of eaten itself and changed it, you know, with the whole digital download thing now, you've got to be really clever.
[2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:08.760]  So I really try my very best right now to participate with our fans as much as possible. Listen to what they're talking about.
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:15.760]  What affects them? You know, it's hard for me to really know what it's like to have food stamps now, but you know what? I did.
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:25.760]  I lived in a car when I was a teenager and I was homeless. My mom was made, so I know all of these things that you have to go through to get by in life.
[2:38:25.760 --> 2:38:30.760]  I think that's one of the things that most rock stars, they try and forget.
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:38.760]  Well, I agree. I see people's arrogance and their haughtiness, and I've been arrogant in my life at certain points, but I kind of flash back and forth.
[2:38:38.760 --> 2:38:46.760]  But I realize you get so much more strength and discernment when you are humble and realize how transitory this life is.
[2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:52.760]  Right. And you know, the best thing about it at the end of the day is that you feel good about yourself when you've done something cool for somebody else,
[2:38:52.760 --> 2:39:00.760]  even if it's just enlightening them and educating them. You know, right now my son's almost 18, so we're going through a lot of life lessons right now.
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:08.760]  And yeah, he's making a lot of really costly mistakes, but there's nothing he hasn't been dismembered or disfigured yet, so everything's okay.
[2:39:08.760 --> 2:39:14.760]  But you know, I see this and I'm thinking like, God, I want to interrupt and I want to rescue him and I want to, I want to, I want to.
[2:39:14.760 --> 2:39:22.760]  But that's why most of the kids in America right now are having so many problems because all this false praise these kids are getting.
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:27.760]  You know what? Little Johnny ain't perfect. You know, he's such a great kid.
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:33.760]  Well, the establishment, the controllers know that. They tell us we've got to be perfect. Madison Avenue tells us we've got to be perfect.
[2:39:33.760 --> 2:39:39.760]  So we all feel inadequate. So we've got to buy this death culture the New World Order is selling.
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:44.760]  And so, oh yeah, your kid got in a fight. Oh, your kid's depressed because they're going into puberty.
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:47.760]  Oh, they bet they need a bunch of mind-altering government-issued drugs.
[2:39:47.760 --> 2:39:49.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:39:49.760 --> 2:39:53.760]  Yeah, or isolate them or single amount in front of everybody.
[2:39:53.760 --> 2:40:05.760]  Or give them electroshock therapy. Now, you were telling me during a break. I don't know if you want to say this on air, but you're going on tour and you were telling me there's some disinfo going on out there about the tour.
[2:40:05.760 --> 2:40:19.760]  Which part? Oh, the big four. Yeah, you know, there's rumors going around. In the beginning of heavy metal in the United States, there were four bands known as the Big Four.
[2:40:19.760 --> 2:40:34.760]  And that was Megadeth, Slayer, Metallica and Anthrax. And, you know, it's funny, whenever I have a new record coming out or anything like that, there's always something like this that perks up to kind of distract the interviews away from my interviews.
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:45.760]  Something other than that. So this is nothing more than a rumor. People are saying that the four bands are going to get together and tour. We haven't heard anything about this other than just rumor and conjecture.
[2:40:45.760 --> 2:41:01.760]  So we are out with Slayer, which is fantastic. And, you know, we're trying really, really hard right now to mend broken fences and just, you know, do the right thing with these guys because the fans love Megadeth and Slayer.
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:14.760]  And the idea of us playing together, they just, they're losing their minds. We went to the Canada. It was all, it was just over the top metal euphoria for these kids. We're going down to Australia.
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:23.760]  I'm leaving on the second down there to New Zealand, Australia, and Japan. And we're coming back. We're going to the Canada. And God willing, you know, we'll be bringing this package into the state someday.
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:32.760]  And people can find out the tour dates around the globe at Megadeth.com death with an E. Ladies and gentlemen, Megadeth.com Dave Mustain joins us.
[2:41:32.760 --> 2:41:45.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're very honored to have him. Dave, getting back into the whole global system, the whole new world order in a nutshell, if you feel like it, give us your world view on the power structure.
[2:41:45.760 --> 2:41:53.760]  You seem to do a lot of research on it and where you believe the planet is going and what the end game really is.
[2:41:53.760 --> 2:42:05.760]  Well, that's a heavy question there to do all that. I'll try my best. Okay, I was brought up the little kid I got baptized that for the Lutheran and I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness.
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:26.760]  And then I revolted and got into witchcraft and black magic and then spent subsequent almost dozen years or, you know, the following 12 years or so trying to get rid of the demonic oppression I got by putting hexes on people.
[2:42:26.760 --> 2:42:33.760]  And then I became a Christian. So, I mean, I've been brought up around so much different religiosity. I'm kind of like civil, you know what I mean?
[2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:47.760]  And when it comes down to me thinking about how things are going towards the end, I have a very distorted view of it because I've been just brainwashed by the Jehovah's Witnesses.
[2:42:47.760 --> 2:42:53.760]  So, you know, when Christmas time comes around, I'm thinking, well, jeez, what's the tree? What's all this crap?
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:43:03.760]  So, anyways, when it comes down to what my understanding is, is that there's going to be a final war at the end and the whole way that the Antichrist plays out, this may alienate some of your listeners and stuff.
[2:43:03.760 --> 2:43:05.760]  I don't mean to make anybody feel bad or alienated.
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:07.760]  You're allowed to have your view. Tell us.
[2:43:07.760 --> 2:43:18.760]  Right, right. The problem is that I just am cautious about the psalms because there's so many people that say they're Christians and they come off telling people that they're not doing stuff right.
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:21.760]  And I don't want to do that because I'm a different kind of person.
[2:43:21.760 --> 2:43:23.760]  So, we want to know your view. You're not preaching. Tell us.
[2:43:23.760 --> 2:43:27.760]  Right. Okay, good. I just need to say that because I just don't want to miss out on it.
[2:43:27.760 --> 2:43:28.760]  No, it's an important preface.
[2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:35.760]  So, what I think right now, I'm watching the president, what you just said about him becoming the president of the U.N.
[2:43:35.760 --> 2:43:44.760]  And I'm watching all these other things happen, like to say that one of the prophecies that came true in the Bible came from when Israel became a country again.
[2:43:44.760 --> 2:43:51.760]  That was a prophecy that said that Israel would become a nation again. Well, it's a nation again. That happened back in the 60s, but it happened.
[2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:58.760]  So, my belief is that there's going to be a new world order. There's going to be one guy that's going to run the world.
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.760]  There's going to be one currency that's around everywhere. They're going to try and get you to take the RFID chip.
[2:44:03.760 --> 2:44:06.760]  That's the mark of the beast that they're going to use to buy and sell things.
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:15.760]  And it's like you had brought up so brilliantly in your movie about Rockefeller saying that if they don't like you, they're just going to turn your chip off.
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:16.760]  Absolutely.
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:22.760]  So, I mean, all of this stuff is mind boggling because you don't really hear about all the technology and stuff like that in the Bible.
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:31.760]  But the Bible is the basic text that I'm trying to live my life by. And I still have a dirty mouth and I still look at women and have kind of terrible thoughts sometimes.
[2:44:31.760 --> 2:44:38.760]  You're not a Pharisee. I mean, look how Jesus hung out with. He didn't hang out with a Pharisee saying how great they were.
[2:44:38.760 --> 2:44:43.760]  He hung out with people who were trying to have a pure heart. I mean, look at David. Look at David.
[2:44:43.760 --> 2:44:50.760]  Had people killed so he could have their women, but he were penned. And so God said, that is a man after my own heart.
[2:44:50.760 --> 2:44:57.760]  Right. Well, I just don't want people to try and find holes in what I'm saying because they've heard me say something in the past that was terrible.
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:05.760]  And I know I've done that. That's one of the things that I'm working on with the whole slayer tours that, you know, 19 years ago, 19 years ago, Alex, I said something,
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:12.760]  but people are still holding on to it and they keep bringing it up and it keeps causing problems with me and with the guys that fire.
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:20.760]  Bottom line is I don't feel that way anymore. And I think that this is going to be a great opportunity for me to go into an area where, you know,
[2:45:20.760 --> 2:45:26.760]  there's a lot of people that cast aspersions and say all kinds of terrible stuff about heavy metal and the people went in.
[2:45:26.760 --> 2:45:31.760]  Yeah, there are people that are terrible, but I'm not. And I think that.
[2:45:31.760 --> 2:45:36.760]  Well, it's very diverse, but Dave, Dave, I interrupted you when you were getting into your worldview.
[2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:44.760]  What do you think about the rapture? Because I've read the Old Testament and it clearly says the beast will wage war against the saints and overcome them.
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:52.760]  How overall raptured out beforehand can the beast wage war? How can he force people to take chips if everybody's submitting?
[2:45:52.760 --> 2:45:57.760]  This is only a 150-year-old, 140-year-old doctrine of the pre-rapture.
[2:45:57.760 --> 2:46:02.760]  And so because everybody believes, I talk to these phony Christians, they won't fight any evil.
[2:46:02.760 --> 2:46:06.760]  They say, praise God, it's getting more evil. That means I'll be teleported out.
[2:46:06.760 --> 2:46:10.760]  I don't think Captain Kirk is going to teleport them off the surface.
[2:46:10.760 --> 2:46:19.760]  Well, I don't believe in the rapture. I don't know enough about it to even know what it is and the fact that, you know, all of a sudden I'm going to be here and then I'm going to be someplace else.
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:24.760]  My understanding is that I'm going to be witness to, you know, the great Armageddon.
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:35.760]  So, you know, I don't know this particular part because that's a little bit more cerebral than I've gotten into it because I've only been a Christian for a little while, but it's certainly good fodder.
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:42.760]  Well, that's amazing. You know, I will tell you, I grew up in Dallas and saw a lot of occult stuff and it was like an occult empire.
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:52.760]  I never really got into it, but, you know, I'd date this super good looking girl who was a couple years older than me and, you know, and go to her parents' house giant mansion and find out they were Satanists.
[2:46:52.760 --> 2:47:01.760]  And I would go out, I would go out with this, you know, super hot chick and find out they were Satanists and I'd be taken to a party and there'd be police there.
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:11.760]  And I would get my car and leave and then they all got mad at me. The cops started pulling me over, you know, because I was wild and mean and beat the hell out of people and I guess came off as Satanic.
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:26.760]  But I wasn't because I have love in my heart, but I think seeing evil and not being perfect and then changing allows you to understand things and have discernment that people that have had a sheltered life or never experienced the power of the Satanic empire,
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:33.760]  I believe that once you've been a little bit on the other side of it, it almost gives you an advantage because now I've been on both sides of the coin.
[2:47:33.760 --> 2:47:43.760]  Right. And that's basically what I was saying in the beginning about being able to have the credentials to talk to these fans, to be able to, you know, to meet them where they're at.
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:48:01.760]  You know, there's nothing worse than being lectured to. If someone wants to know something, you know, as human beings, we have most of us when we're curious about something, you know, they can take it to, they can get unhuman strength and be able to sit up for hours studying things.
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:07.760]  You know, if they're interested in it, you know, for me, if I'm not interested, I can be asleep within 30 seconds.
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:17.760]  But because you've been into the occult, you can actually, people ask you, explain, this wasn't fun for me and they wouldn't listen to some preacher, but they'd listen to Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:25.760]  Yeah, they would. And that's the great thing about all of this because I'm not misusing my celebrity to tell people what to do.
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:34.760]  We've always been really supportive of encouraging people to read. That's why I've tried to use words more than baby baby in my songs.
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:44.760]  And that's why we've had stuff that's been really provocative, stuff that really encourages our listeners to stay in school and to do something good and become great.
[2:48:44.760 --> 2:48:55.760]  Well, Dave, I mean, this is incredibly powerful. What's your, what's your saying here today? And I know you're going to be a really great vessel for waking people up.
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:49:08.760]  But you say you've just now recently become a Christian. I think God's seal, the creator of the universe's seal was on your heart from the beginning because the fruits, you were the only heavy metal band that really didn't have that Satanism running through it.
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:15.760]  And everything you've done really was speaking against that system. And you said you didn't even understand what you were writing at the time.
[2:49:15.760 --> 2:49:24.760]  I think you were one of the lost sheep or the prodigal son. I think you've just come back home where you were always meant to be, but not in the false church, but in the real church that's in your heart.
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:39.760]  Well, thanks. I'll accept that. I've always felt that there was something cool that there was a much deeper meaning to what I was doing playing on stage because I don't practice Alex.
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:46.760]  I picked the guitar about three days before we go on tour and I have to learn the songs again. And then we go out on stage and play.
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:56.760]  And I don't know how that happened. It just happened. I know that my sister played piano when I was a kid and she asked me to play guitar with her and I thought absolutely anything to drown out that noise.
[2:49:56.760 --> 2:50:06.760]  And I started learning how to play guitar and I would put it down and I wouldn't even look at it. I've lived in this new apartment here since my wife and I are separated.
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:10.760]  I've been here for almost a month. There's a guitar here. I haven't touched it.
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:20.760]  And it's really weird because you would think that it would be something that would be an extension of my body.
[2:50:20.760 --> 2:50:29.760]  Well, I mean, I think you're such a natural and that it's something that you pick up when you go out there to perform and just let it flow through you.
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:37.760]  We've got a final segment with Dave Mustaine. I know he's got some other stuff coming up. We'll see if I can twist his arm into five, ten minutes more because I want to be able to play a few more clips of his songs.
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:44.760]  But he's got to leave us in about ten minutes. I would imagine, Dave, that you'll join us again when you get back from Australia.
[2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:46.760]  I would love to do that.
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:53.760]  Amazing. Again, megadeth.com. Dave Mustaine. We have links to it up on infowars.com. The album is out.
[2:50:53.760 --> 2:50:58.760]  Number one record in the country out of the gates right now at amazon.com.

[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:09.760]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[2:52:09.760 --> 2:52:17.760]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[2:52:17.760 --> 2:52:25.760]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:37.760]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[2:52:37.760 --> 2:52:43.760]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:47.760]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:33.760]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom, and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter, sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[2:53:33.760 --> 2:53:36.760]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:44.760]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high-quality health supplements.

[2:54:15.760 --> 2:54:19.760]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?
[2:54:19.760 --> 2:54:22.760]  Talk to him every day.
[2:54:22.760 --> 2:54:26.760]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:29.760]  I go to court when I have to.
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:31.760]  By the way, the site is almost done.
[2:54:31.760 --> 2:54:33.760]  I'm going to go ahead and launch it today.
[2:54:33.760 --> 2:54:36.760]  It is falloftherepublic.com.
[2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:43.760]  We're building some of the sub pages right now, but the new film is coming out October 21st, Fall of the Republic.
[2:54:43.760 --> 2:54:51.760]  On Sunday's show, I'm going to show you the cover of the film, but the website is similar, falloftherepublic.com.
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:54.760]  Megadeth.com is Dave Mustaine's band site.
[2:54:54.760 --> 2:54:56.760]  He's the founder, guitarist, and lead singer.
[2:54:56.760 --> 2:55:00.760]  The album is number one on many charts, and number one on Amazon right now.
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:01.760]  They're going on tour.
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:02.760]  His new book is coming out.
[2:55:02.760 --> 2:55:05.760]  Find out about it all at megadeth.com.
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:09.760]  And you just heard the intro to Peace Cells there.
[2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:11.760]  Dave, we've got about five minutes left.
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:13.760]  I've asked a lot of questions.
[2:55:13.760 --> 2:55:15.760]  What's on Dave Mustaine's mind?
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:20.760]  Right now, I've got just preparing for the new tour coming up.
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:29.760]  I have something that was wrong with my neck and my back, so I've been doing a lot of physical therapy for that from all the head banging over all the years.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:44.760]  And just working on myself, I'm trying to work out things with my kids and my marriage and stuff, and just looking at my life in general, and what do I do? What's my role? How can I help people?
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:51.760]  You've got another interview coming up, but Dave's going to be back on with us in November when his next tour gets ready to kick off.
[2:55:51.760 --> 2:55:53.760]  We'll have a lot more to talk about.
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:56:00.760]  But let me just tell you from my perspective, we're getting calls, emails, huge comments on our message board in the comment sections.
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:05.760]  People love, and I'm talking about serious death fans, serious megadeth fans.
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:08.760]  They love the new album, and I think it's going to be one of your biggest and greatest.
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:12.760]  I guess it, I mean, out of the gates, it's already happening.
[2:56:12.760 --> 2:56:15.760]  And I just think this is a really exciting direction you're going in.
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:19.760]  I mean, you're still going in the same direction, but you've kind of kicked it up a notch in intensity.
[2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:21.760]  Are you getting the same feedback?
[2:56:21.760 --> 2:56:23.760]  Well, we've got a lot of great reviews.
[2:56:23.760 --> 2:56:34.760]  By no means does anything over get, and this band would be really blessed if we were able to gain some of your following.
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:37.760]  And basically, you and I are speaking the same language.
[2:56:37.760 --> 2:56:46.760]  We're singing from the same hymnal, but with what we're trying to do, get these tours out of the way,
[2:56:46.760 --> 2:56:53.760]  Yeah, you can plan on us being back in the studio or me visiting you out there for some barbecue in November.
[2:56:53.760 --> 2:56:54.760]  Man, that is awesome.
[2:56:54.760 --> 2:56:57.760]  Or I'll come out whenever I'm out in your neck of the woods.
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:56:59.760]  Maybe we can hook up for some barbecue, but it is better.
[2:56:59.760 --> 2:57:00.760]  It is better here.
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:01.760]  You're out in California.
[2:57:01.760 --> 2:57:03.760]  I guess they got good sushi there.
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:06.760]  You would say everybody says they got good sushi out here.
[2:57:06.760 --> 2:57:07.760]  And you know what?
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:11.760]  You go into one of these places and it's like, I didn't know it was green.
[2:57:11.760 --> 2:57:14.760]  So, anyway, back to what we were talking about before.
[2:57:14.760 --> 2:57:19.760]  It would be really great to invite you and your crew down to our concert, too,
[2:57:19.760 --> 2:57:21.760]  if you want to bring a film crew down there.
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:24.760]  And we can talk some more there and show you a little bit about what I do.
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:26.760]  Absolutely killer.
[2:57:26.760 --> 2:57:29.760]  Well, Dave, we'll stay in touch with you and your management.
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:33.760]  And you are really trailblazing with your record label.
[2:57:33.760 --> 2:57:34.760]  People should support it.
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:35.760]  It is independent.
[2:57:35.760 --> 2:57:36.760]  It is Maverick.
[2:57:36.760 --> 2:57:38.760]  It is original and authentic.
[2:57:38.760 --> 2:57:41.760]  Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth.
[2:57:41.760 --> 2:57:43.760]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:45.760]  The film is in-game.
[2:57:45.760 --> 2:57:47.760]  Dave, thank you so much.
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:48.760]  You're welcome, Alex.
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  Take care.
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:50.760]  All right.
[2:57:50.760 --> 2:57:51.760]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[2:57:51.760 --> 2:57:52.760]  Well, that is exciting.
[2:57:52.760 --> 2:57:53.760]  There goes Dave.
[2:57:53.760 --> 2:57:58.760]  Man, again, ladies and gentlemen, and Muse is doing interviews,
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:57:59.760]  saying 9-11 is an inside job.
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:00.760]  They've been on the show.
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:01.760]  Bellamy.
[2:58:01.760 --> 2:58:03.760]  It's one of the number one bands right now.
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.760]  If I told you some of the other music icons I've talked to or that I know,
[2:58:07.760 --> 2:58:10.760]  or that I know through other people that are aware of the New World Order,
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:12.760]  you wouldn't believe it.
[2:58:12.760 --> 2:58:15.760]  The Hollywood people, you wouldn't believe it.
[2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:16.760]  There is an awakening.
[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:19.760]  The general public doesn't want world government world tyranny.
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:22.760]  That's why at the G20, they've got to have the police come out.
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:26.760]  In fact, I meant when Dave was on to play that armored vehicle audio and video
[2:58:26.760 --> 2:58:29.760]  where they're saying, you are not allowed to assemble.
[2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:33.760]  In fact, we'll come back with that after this break.
[2:58:33.760 --> 2:58:35.760]  And then we'll come in with the music after that, John.
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:38.760]  And then we're going to get a report from the G20 from our reporters on the ground.
[2:58:38.760 --> 2:58:40.760]  And then Bob Chapman pops back in.
[2:58:40.760 --> 2:58:43.760]  Get with us.
[2:58:43.760 --> 2:58:45.760]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:19.760]  What do you mean I don't believe in God?

[3:00:23.760 --> 3:00:26.760]  What do you mean I don't support your system?
[3:00:26.760 --> 3:00:30.760]  I go to court when I have to?
[3:00:30.760 --> 3:00:33.760]  What do you mean I can't get to work on time?
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:37.760]  I've got nothing better to do.
[3:00:37.760 --> 3:00:40.760]  What do you mean I don't pay my bills?
[3:00:40.760 --> 3:00:45.760]  What do you think I broke?
[3:00:45.760 --> 3:00:48.760]  There's a new way.
[3:00:48.760 --> 3:00:52.760]  I'll be the first in line.
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:01:01.760]  But it better work this time.
[3:01:01.760 --> 3:01:04.760]  What do you mean I've hurt your feelings?
[3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:08.760]  I didn't know you had any feelings.
[3:01:08.760 --> 3:01:11.760]  What do you mean I ain't kind?
[3:01:11.760 --> 3:01:15.760]  I'm just not your kind.
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:18.760]  What do you mean I couldn't be the president
[3:01:18.760 --> 3:01:22.760]  or the United States of America?
[3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:24.760]  There's only something.
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:31.760]  It's still we, the people, right?
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:34.760]  There's never a new way.
[3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:38.760]  I'll be the first in line.
[3:01:38.760 --> 3:01:41.760]  But it better work this time.
[3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:44.760]  This time.
[3:01:44.760 --> 3:01:46.760]  Peace sells.
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:48.760]  Peace sells.
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:49.760]  I love that end part.
[3:01:49.760 --> 3:01:50.760]  It's coming up.
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:51.760]  Break it up, baby!
[3:01:51.760 --> 3:01:52.760]  Yeah!
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:54.760]  We're taking on the New World Order!
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:58.760]  Yeah!
[3:01:58.760 --> 3:01:59.760]  Yeah!
[3:01:59.760 --> 3:02:01.760]  Let them see your war face!
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:07.760]  Yeah!
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:17.760]  Yeah!
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:21.760]  We used to go to meet people from school.
[3:02:21.760 --> 3:02:23.760]  That high school that wanted to get in the fight.
[3:02:23.760 --> 3:02:25.760]  We'd pull into a field, this cranking up,
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:28.760]  slide out of the car and just start going wild.
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:29.760]  But you know what?
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:31.760]  I'd put all that energy into fighting the New World Order now.
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:37.760]  Break it up!
[3:02:37.760 --> 3:02:38.760]  Peace.
[3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  Peace.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:40.760]  There it is.
[3:02:40.760 --> 3:02:43.760]  Peace sells.
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:46.760]  Peace.
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:50.760]  Peace sells.
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:51.760]  Peace sells.
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:53.760]  I'm fun to fire.
[3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:54.760]  Peace sells.
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:56.760]  I'm fun to fire.
[3:02:56.760 --> 3:02:57.760]  Peace sells.
[3:02:57.760 --> 3:02:59.760]  I'm fun to fire.

[3:03:01.760 --> 3:03:03.760]  Peace sells.
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:08.760]  I'm fun to fire.
[3:03:08.760 --> 3:03:11.760]  Man, that is right, baby!
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:15.760]  Yeah!
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:20.760]  Dave Mustaine joining the fight against the New World Order.
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:23.760]  He was always there, but now he's 100%.
[3:03:23.760 --> 3:03:25.760]  Very exciting.
[3:03:25.760 --> 3:03:30.760]  Let's end this segment with the thugs of the New World Order broadcasting
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:34.760]  almost the same intro from his new title track, Endgame.

[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:39.360]  It's going to go on pre-sale tomorrow at infowars.com. When you order first, that means that in the
[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:43.280]  orders, it ships out first. And we're probably going to, just like with Camp FEMA,
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:48.160]  probably going to start shipping this a few days before October 21st on that Wednesday. We're going
[3:08:48.160 --> 3:08:53.520]  to shoot to start shipping Monday with UPS. Everybody gets it within three days. Most people in the
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:08:58.960]  U.S. depending on where you live within two days. So a lot of you will get it on the 21st of October.
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:09:04.640]  Pre-order today at infowars.com. In fact, I meant to get in this morning and tell them to go ahead
[3:09:04.640 --> 3:09:09.520]  and get it up on the shopping cart. We haven't done that. Kurt Nemo is finishing up the fall,
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:14.480]  the republic sub pages because we've all been racing with other work. In fact, can we put fall,
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:20.400]  the republic.com up on screen for folks. Now, this isn't the video cover, but we'll show you
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:25.760]  the video cover coming up this weekend. It'll be posted on infowars.com. We'll probably even this
[3:09:25.760 --> 3:09:33.120]  afternoon get it up for pre-sale Friday afternoon, Friday evening. Now, almost every new film I
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:38.480]  make, I say this is my greatest film ever because each film gets better. I mean, you saw what we
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:46.800]  went from American destroyed by design to police state 2000 to police state to the takeover,
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:53.680]  right through police state three, matrix of evil, road to tyranny, martial law,
[3:09:55.440 --> 3:10:00.480]  and all the other documentaries like terror storm and the order of death and dark secrets inside
[3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:07.760]  Bohemian Grove and American dictators. And end game was a whole nother level information wise.
[3:10:07.760 --> 3:10:13.280]  It's the total combo that really gives you a good view on everything. The Obama deception,
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:18.400]  the biggest film we've ever released, the most viral, the most successful, the most DVDs handed
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:21.920]  out people have made copies of and given it to people. The biggest film we've had,
[3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:27.440]  conservatively over a hundred million people have seen my films free online. I mean, it's got to be
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:32.960]  over 25 million now just with Obama deception. And of course, I executive produced loose change
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:39.600]  trial cut seen by millions. The point is, is that when I tell you that fall the Republic blows
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:48.400]  everything we've ever made away, believe me, my most expensive film was about $120,000 to make.
[3:10:49.360 --> 3:10:55.040]  That was end game. Obama deception because we rushed the making of it and it's really good.
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:11:00.080]  It was only about 80 grand. This film, for me, it sounds like nothing to people that are, you know,
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:06.560]  big, huge movie makers, $200,000 budget to give you an idea. And six months making it,
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:13.360]  I mean, I'm up here till one, two at night, six, seven days a week. This thing is unbelievable.
[3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:18.880]  I mean, and oh, here's another big announcement about it. It's fall the Republic volume one.
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:26.240]  We ended up about a month ago with a four hour film, all this new info coming in. And I said,
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:30.240]  there's no way I can't make it now that the film is two hours, 22 minutes long, no 20,
[3:11:30.240 --> 3:11:35.040]  24 minutes. I added, I made everybody shoot some more stuff last night on some other issues. We
[3:11:35.040 --> 3:11:40.240]  just added it, but that was what I was finally done this morning. So Aaron's not here. He was up all
[3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:51.440]  night. Fall of the Republic is 224 minutes long. It has 19 interviews, but also footage on the ground,
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:56.720]  voiceover documents, I mean, video clips, the research that went into it. No film I've ever
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:12:03.040]  made has as much research. And it's part one. It covers how the banks did the takeover, the
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:09.440]  derivatives, the scam, their world government plan. It gets into the eugenics, TV, mind control,
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:15.360]  how they control society, the citizen spy networks, just ladies and gentlemen, it's
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:23.520]  got Jesse Ventura, Max Kaiser, Bob Bowman, Webster Tarpoli, George Humphrey. I mean,
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:29.040]  the list just goes on and on. In fact, I've got to get a full list of that. 19 interviews. I put
[3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:37.600]  people on 17 airplanes to fly to Canada and California and Florida, John Perkins, Confessions
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:47.280]  of an Economic Hitman, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny. I mean, the list goes on and on and on Oathkeepers.
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:54.080]  We went to 10 cities in California. 17 missions. We flew two groups of people here to be interviewed.
[3:12:55.360 --> 3:13:02.720]  I'm in the film and the voiceover is the best boil down script of key information.
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:09.040]  The analysis, again, it's going on sale this afternoon tomorrow. In the next few weeks,
[3:13:09.040 --> 3:13:13.840]  we've got two big trailers coming out that'll give you a sneak peek at it. Start pre-ordering
[3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:21.360]  tonight or tomorrow when it goes up, falloftherepublic.com. That says infowars.com, fall of
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:27.120]  the Republic. The main site's not up. So people can just go to falloftherepublic.com and get it.
[3:13:27.680 --> 3:13:30.800]  Okay, good. Yeah. So the actual URL is falloftherepublic.com.
[3:13:30.800 --> 3:13:40.240]  I'm just looking at infowars, URL subpage version of it. They're on screen. But the point is,
[3:13:40.240 --> 3:13:44.480]  they've denied world government was here. They've denied world government was happening.
[3:13:44.480 --> 3:13:48.800]  They've denied world government was a reality. And then now they've had to admit it's all real,
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:53.760]  and we go back over their history, everything I'm telling you. I was watching this film last night
[3:13:54.560 --> 3:13:58.800]  at about 1.30 in the morning after I got off coast to coast AM, been working on it before and then
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:06.960]  after. And I said to Aaron and to Rob Jacobson, who really deserve as much credit as myself or
[3:14:06.960 --> 3:14:11.680]  anybody else in this film. I couldn't do it without these two men and their dedication.
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:14.640]  Because you have to get more people on it, but you have something like this. It has to be a small
[3:14:14.640 --> 3:14:19.600]  number so that, I'm not comparing myself to Stanley Kubrick, but people said you'd go to his sets,
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:23.360]  there'd be 10 people on them. You go to a regular Hollywood set, there'd be hundreds or thousands.
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:29.360]  It's the same thing here. It's just a very small knit group. Bermas has worked on it. Rob Duh, Jason
[3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:39.920]  Douglas, Mike McWhorter, Mr. Dill, everybody who was involved in this, Glenn Dill, the guys that
[3:14:39.920 --> 3:14:47.120]  did the music, Derek Einkopf, Craig, Will Jones, all the guys are such great musicians, because
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:51.440]  we got three guys at work here that have, are in the same band here in Austin, that the music
[3:14:51.440 --> 3:15:00.640]  is title track and a major motion picture good. And I love Mr. Reynolds, who we've used in other
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:04.560]  films, and he's great. And he's gotten orchestras together for it. We shouldn't have the time to
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:11.200]  do that, but this turned out just as good and different. So Rob Jacobson made some of the
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:17.920]  music. I mean, it is just, it is a out of the park success. This is going to be devastating
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:24.480]  to the New World Order and all the glory goes to God. I tell you, to bust your butt like this,
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:28.720]  to get black circles around your eyes, to accelerate your aging, you know, working so hard
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:34.720]  to your hair falling out. I don't care. I love just spending myself on a worthy cause to know those
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:40.560]  dedications, those passions to, to be able to make something like fall the republic. It's volume
[3:15:40.560 --> 3:15:47.040]  one, volume two is going to be eugenics, mind control, the concentration camps and how to defeat
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:53.200]  them. There's a lot of solutions in this film as well. Gerald Salente's in it. I mean, the list
[3:15:53.200 --> 3:16:00.160]  goes on and on. The point is, this is heads above before the films were a little better than the
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:05.520]  before before. This is a whole quantum leap and we have better computers and more research and
[3:16:05.520 --> 3:16:14.320]  we're better at what we do now. It is a quantum leap, a whole nother level about any film I have
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:22.160]  ever produced. It is a quantum leap. The IT guys helping us with the systems to get it done everybody
[3:16:22.160 --> 3:16:26.000]  and you, the listeners that have supported us, you especially need credit for your financial
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:29.920]  support, buying the other books and videos and t-shirts and materials and supporting our sponsors.
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:35.920]  You have made this possible where we have the financing to send 17 crews out
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:44.080]  at around $5,000 for trip. I don't know what 17 times 5,000. I've done the math in the total
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:50.880]  budget of this thing. The graphics, everything. It's just so fulfilling to be on the right
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:55.120]  side of history. It's so fulfilling to know the truth. It's so fulfilling to be proven right.
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:59.360]  It's so fulfilling when we get the death threats and the COINTELPRO and the lies and the attacks,
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:03.920]  each one worse than the next, to know they're attacking us because we are doing good, because
[3:17:03.920 --> 3:17:08.800]  we are having an effect in history. We do matter with this species and the way the film ends,
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:15.600]  I'm going to leave that as a surprise. Follow the Republic. I'm going to quit waxing here,
[3:17:16.320 --> 3:17:21.440]  eloquent about it, but it is just follow the Republic goes on pre-sale tonight or tomorrow.
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:25.680]  I'm not sure when we got to get it up all properly at infowars.com. You can start writing to us.
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:34.000]  It's 1995. You start writing to us at 3,001 South Lamar, sweet 100 Austin, Texas 787-04.
[3:17:34.000 --> 3:17:37.040]  Of course, we're not really using the address anymore. It's better to send it to infowars,
[3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:46.800]  PO Box 1-9-549, Austin, Texas 787-60, PO Box 1-9-549, Austin, Texas 787-60 or infowars.com.
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:50.720]  And of course, October 21st, it will debut in super high quality. We're even trying to put it
[3:17:50.720 --> 3:17:54.880]  out on the web in actual high death. I think we're going to be able to do that. It's close to high
[3:17:54.880 --> 3:17:59.520]  death right now in the highest quality, but we're having a bunch of versions at prismplanet.tv.
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:03.200]  Okay. I got my guys holding. Let's go to Jason Bermas and then Jason Douglas,
[3:18:03.200 --> 3:18:06.400]  also on the phone from the middle of the crowd. What's happened since an hour and a
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:11.440]  half ago when I talked to you? Well, now we're on Mobile Alex. The police force
[3:18:11.440 --> 3:18:15.920]  has a much greater presence as we reach downtown. I told you,
[3:18:15.920 --> 3:18:20.560]  you're going to march in. They're going to surround you. It's very possible. I'm not sure
[3:18:20.560 --> 3:18:27.040]  where this is ending right now, but I've got video of hundreds of police officers now massed
[3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:32.080]  at the block. Many of them in riot gear. Many of them are overzealous. Some people are throwing
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:37.920]  a peace sign up, but it's, you know, a young lady, again, not weighing more than 105 pounds,
[3:18:37.920 --> 3:18:42.480]  dared to put one of her feet on the sidewalk next to me and she was threatened with a batoning.
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:48.080]  I got it on video. I mean, come on. You know, she just, you know, I just keep running into Cindy
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:52.880]  Sheehan and as fast as a thousand people and Cindy was standing next to her. She couldn't
[3:18:52.880 --> 3:18:58.480]  believe that he even made the baton. I couldn't believe it. It's a little bit of controlled madness
[3:18:58.480 --> 3:19:04.960]  right now. It's pretty crazy. We are mobile yet again. I stopped at the Capitol for a while
[3:19:04.960 --> 3:19:11.760]  while there was some sort of a concert going on. And right now I can see, I believe it's the 7th
[3:19:11.760 --> 3:19:18.880]  Street or Clemente Bridge. I'm not sure which one. I can tell you I'm at the corner of 6th Avenue
[3:19:18.880 --> 3:19:25.840]  and maybe 6th and 7th Street where they converge. And there are thousands of people
[3:19:25.840 --> 3:19:30.560]  and hundreds of police officers courting off side streets right now. I'm filming them. Yeah,
[3:19:30.560 --> 3:19:34.080]  that's it. They're getting ready to lock down the main protest. You guys need to split up.
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:38.960]  Somebody at the front, somebody at the back with a plan to get out of there quick if they
[3:19:38.960 --> 3:19:42.880]  start closing it down. Stay there, Jason. I want more from you and Jason Douglas as well.
[3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:48.560]  Jason Douglas, Jason Burmese, Rob Doodoo doing a great job. Pray for him on the ground at the
[3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:54.000]  G20, open world government being announced. What an insane show today. Dave Mustain on the

[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:27.280]  By order of the City of Pittsburgh Chief Police, I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:38.880]  This is yesterday in Pittsburgh. Same things going on now. This is not a flashback to police
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:44.080]  state 2000 shot in 1999 with the Marines drilling to take over U.S. cities saying the same thing.
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:50.320]  This is what the military Northcom Homeland Security is for. It is for you. Mainstream news
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.640]  announcing Obama's president of the world bringing us into the New World Order. Those are the
[3:24:54.640 --> 3:25:00.080]  headlines. Eight thousand plus articles in Google News with the term New World Order in them.
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:12.960]  Jason Burmes, what is it like to see this actually unfolding?
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:36.080]  As I said, as we approach this, the riot killer police and the military presence
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:43.120]  became much, much greater. Jason, you're going to be live Sunday, six to nine p.m. But I want to
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:49.680]  have you, Rob do and Jason Douglas in studio in the first hour Sunday when you're back. And if you
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:55.360]  guys can come in and get a few of the key video clips like them, what Douglas says he has of them,
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:59.680]  sound canoning people on their front porch and little kids will play some clips of that
[3:25:59.680 --> 3:26:03.760]  on the radio and at prisonplanet.tv and Sunday ahead of your show. I know they've got to get
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:07.520]  back to their families. They've been gone all week, but make sure the guys know that I want
[3:26:07.520 --> 3:26:13.360]  them here Sunday if they can do it. If not, you can come in and have them. As soon as I get off
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:18.640]  that plane, I will start capturing video. This is just too important not to get out to the masses
[3:26:18.640 --> 3:26:23.440]  as soon as possible. Yeah, we should have probably said another just a web person. You could hand
[3:26:23.440 --> 3:26:28.960]  the stuff off too to do it, but then we didn't send the right equipment, but that's okay. We're
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:33.920]  not professional soldiers in the info war here. We're professional amateurs doing the best we
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:38.080]  can to fight the new world order. Let's go to Jason Douglas. Stay there.
[3:26:39.920 --> 3:26:44.080]  Burmese, but I want to go back to Jason Douglas to Jason's here. Douglas, what have you been
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:50.160]  seeing happening? Well, right now I'm at 6th Avenue and Wood Street. And basically what they're
[3:26:50.160 --> 3:26:57.600]  doing is as we move block by block, they collapse, you know, the group of police officers. And right
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:03.840]  now it's about a hundred foot deep of police officers basically pushing the marchers to some
[3:27:03.840 --> 3:27:08.400]  undisclosed location, I guess. So as I said, as I said, they've now gotten behind you. They're
[3:27:08.400 --> 3:27:13.920]  going to be waiting in front and block you off all at one spot. Right. That is exactly what
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:19.360]  they're doing. Every time I get to a new block, there's another collapse of soldiers. And, um,
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:24.400]  yeah, trying to... Yeah, Burmese, Burmese said that there are army there. Have you,
[3:27:24.400 --> 3:27:28.160]  obviously we haven't seen it. Have you seen the video of snatch and grab teams
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:32.560]  grabbing peaceful demonstrators and shoving them in police cars with the army driving them and
[3:27:32.560 --> 3:27:38.160]  driving them away? Um, I haven't seen any video of it. I've seen patty wagons. I've seen them,
[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:42.000]  you know, zoom away through the crowd. Well, obviously you're on the ground so you can't
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:46.080]  see the video. What I'm telling you is we're here seeing it all. That's why I stayed here at the
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:50.000]  command center so we can kind of coordinate. You know, there's got to be a general here in our
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:55.120]  little operation. I wish I was there with you. Like I said, I've seen the patty wagons come in
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:28:00.560]  and then zoom away, but I haven't seen, you know, with my own eyes and been able to capture it on
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:07.280]  video. Burmese is saying he has seen them billy club people threaten the billy club people.
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:13.360]  Yep. Well, I was standing in front of the line in between the anarchist or supposed anarchist
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:18.800]  and the, uh, the military line and they all had rifles. And then for some reason I can't figure
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:23.680]  out what it was. Um, they just started pointing the rifles right in our face. I had a tear gas
[3:28:24.720 --> 3:28:31.280]  you know, two inches from my face. You're telling me that they were pointing rifles.
[3:28:31.280 --> 3:28:37.120]  Were they, they look like shotguns? Yeah. You know, it looked bigger than a shotgun.
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:41.280]  It looked like a grenade launcher is what it looked like. That's why probably a big tear gas
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:47.680]  launcher or those can kill you up close. Remember the Red Sox, they, they killed some girl walked
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:51.280]  out of a bar and they shot her at 10 feet in the eye and it pushed her eye back in her brain.
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:54.560]  You have video of them just for no reason, aiming the weapons at you.
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:59.360]  You know, I don't know what I got exactly because I was right in the middle of changing tapes when
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:04.560]  that happened. And, um, I slammed the tape in and I pressed report as fast as I could,
[3:29:04.560 --> 3:29:11.920]  but I also wet myself a little bit. So it was pretty intense. Did you, did you really
[3:29:11.920 --> 3:29:18.880]  bite yourself? No, not really, but you know, all of a sudden they got very aggressive and
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:22.800]  started moving towards this and pointing weapons. And I personally have never had anything that
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:27.600]  big. Well, that's what, that's what Burma said. He said, just some woman stepped up on the sidewalk
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.080]  and the guy took a billy club and said, I'll smash your teeth in whore. You know, basically,
[3:29:32.480 --> 3:29:36.560]  and we've seen videos of that, but we can't play it here. We're playing them without audio
[3:29:36.560 --> 3:29:41.280]  because it's cops cussing, citizens cussing. People just are videotaping a cop and you see
[3:29:41.280 --> 3:29:46.640]  him. The cop goes, I'm about to beat the hell out of you, bitch. You know, it is. And he adds
[3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:52.400]  a few things we can't say on air. Stay there. Final report from you straight ahead. We're on the
[3:29:52.400 --> 3:30:02.320]  March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, friends. This is

[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:17.280]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are
[3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:22.320]  directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental system diseases. Now, what are
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:27.760]  you going to do about it? The Acola blue atmospheric water generator is a low cost way to take back

[3:33:18.640 --> 3:33:24.560]  coming back tomorrow. Full report for UN Studio Sunday with exclusive video as well that our
[3:33:24.560 --> 3:33:30.240]  team has shot. We've never had due on these days except for when the military tried to set you
[3:33:30.240 --> 3:33:35.760]  guys up Wednesday night but he was saying he was up on a rooftop while Luke Radowski was bullhorning
[3:33:35.760 --> 3:33:40.480]  him. Then they hit the crowd yesterday with the sound weapon and Luke tried to hold his ground for
[3:33:40.480 --> 3:33:44.960]  a while did a great job and everybody dispersed. I mean this is like out of a science fiction
[3:33:44.960 --> 3:34:02.640]  dystopic novel. Douglas, this is like something out of a science fiction movie.
[3:34:02.640 --> 3:34:08.000]  That's exactly what this is. I mean there was a band playing the imperial song, the imperial
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  story trooper song and it was so apropos. That's exactly what this is. The only thing that's
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:19.600]  not the same is that they're all in different uniforms. It's people from all over the country,
[3:34:19.600 --> 3:34:25.520]  police from all over the country and National Guard but you know they all look like stormtroopers.
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:31.600]  And border patrol? And border patrol, homeland security. I mean too many to even name.
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.960]  Well it's incredible. Any closing thoughts?
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:44.880]  You know I just can't believe that this is happening. They give us five seconds to talk
[3:34:44.880 --> 3:34:51.840]  and then they push us and then they corral us onto this bridge right now. I'm just not sure
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:57.360]  about the state of this country anymore. Was it you or Bermas that said that they had one
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:35:02.400]  permitted march yesterday and they wouldn't even allow them to march? The permitted march was on
[3:35:02.400 --> 3:35:08.080]  the 20th and they didn't allow it to go all the way down to the convention center. This is the
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:12.640]  closest we've gotten to the convention center. I can see it right now. It's about a block and a half
[3:35:12.640 --> 3:35:20.800]  away. Of course there's about six metal fences and about 502 in between us and the convention center.
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:25.680]  Okay I'm going to be here all day. If anything happens call us. We'll go live on the video
[3:35:25.680 --> 3:35:31.040]  audio streams at infowars.com. I'm the Full Radio Show. Wish we could but we can't. Stations, affiliates
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:35.760]  only have us at set times obviously to the way radio programming works. But we'll go live.
[3:35:35.760 --> 3:35:41.040]  People just watch infowars for that. If that happens we may even put the prisonplanet.tv
[3:35:41.040 --> 3:35:45.120]  stream out for free. We can't afford that for more than a day or so but we'll put the video
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:50.480]  stream out if things continue to develop. Thank you so much Jason Douglas for the great job you're
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:55.360]  doing. Keep it up. Be careful. Get out of there if they start attacking everybody. The mission is
[3:35:55.360 --> 3:36:02.480]  get the video out and stay safe. God bless you. Thank you. Let's go to a final comment
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:06.720]  that we're going to Bob Chapman for the balance of the hour with more economic news on the global
[3:36:06.720 --> 3:36:11.520]  government announcing world tax and the end of the dollar. Burma's any closing comments?
[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:16.960]  You know I'm really just fully in the thick of it. We were able to get over the bridge again.
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:23.760]  Thousands of people still protesting here. The police presence is not so much larger.
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:28.880]  I have a couple of dogs. I've got them on tape going nuts. A few of them have the muscles on.
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:34.560]  Some of them do not have the muscles on. It really goes to the nothing right now to my left
[3:36:35.280 --> 3:36:40.000]  that they are ready to move the crowd along to wherever they're trying to gather us into.
[3:36:40.560 --> 3:36:45.920]  It does not look like I am going to be able to get on a sidewalk in about a block or two.
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:50.320]  It's just incredible Alex. I really can't wait to get back and give a full report
[3:36:50.320 --> 3:36:54.240]  when we're able to capture some of this tape and show people the footage that we... Well Jason,
[3:36:54.240 --> 3:36:59.120]  you know they're using those dogs like in South Africa or Nazi Germany for intimidation. They
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:04.320]  bring them into schools and have them snap at kids and bite at them as they did in Goose Creek,
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:10.000]  North Carolina famously. Look for an exit out of there. Why don't you get out of the crowd before
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:13.920]  they lock down and rubber bullet and sound count on everybody because they have a bloodlust for
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:19.840]  the American people. We've got, as you said, photos and videos. We just sent Rob to get Aaron
[3:37:19.840 --> 3:37:23.920]  out of bed. He worked too late last night. Aaron has it last night. I saw it so we can try to get
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:29.120]  it at the end of the show. But if they're rolling around, well you said you saw this too yesterday.
[3:37:29.120 --> 3:37:33.600]  Them just going through empty neighborhoods sound canoning. Rob casting that nobody's allowed to
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:39.120]  be on the streets. Well yeah, you know, they were, again, they did such a great job of dispersing
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:44.480]  people. There would literally be 15 or 20 people coming down the street, you know, and then there'd
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:50.080]  be 10 or 15 people just out on their churches who want nothing to do with this protest. And that
[3:37:50.080 --> 3:37:55.680]  doesn't stop them from using the LRAP. It's unbelievable. It's inconceivable. Yet it's true.
[3:37:57.120 --> 3:38:01.520]  It's really starting to get loud now, Alex. They're consoling us three times. I'm sure you can hear it.
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:07.840]  Mermis, I'm going to keep you on hold and come back to you in five minutes as this develops. Okay?
[3:38:08.560 --> 3:38:10.960]  You got it. Just put your phone in your pocket.
[3:38:10.960 --> 3:38:16.960]  Or, well, I don't want to hang up and lose you. Just keep it with you and I'll come back to you
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:23.600]  in five minutes. Okay? All right, stop it. Boy, that is crazy. Maybe from time to time,
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:27.040]  you just fade up the background while Bob Chapman's talking so people can hear this.
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:33.040]  Bob Chapman, you fought the communist in Europe in military intelligence in Berlin.
[3:38:34.160 --> 3:38:38.800]  We have a video that we broke a month ago that's finally made national news. It's all over Fox,
[3:38:38.800 --> 3:38:44.320]  CNN. In fact, cue that up in the little kids worshiping Obama. And they say this line about,
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:49.760]  instead of Jesus loves all the little children, they say this poem and then they sing another song
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:54.080]  about red, yellow, black and white. They are all equal in his sight. Well, they say they're all
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:59.040]  equal in Obama's sight and they sing the song. This is directly out of North Korea. This is worse
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:06.560]  than Hitler, worse than Stalin, worse than Mao, Paul Watson's girlfriend who was born in China.
[3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:10.720]  She got really freaked out when she saw this because she's a patriot. And she said, that's
[3:39:10.720 --> 3:39:16.080]  what we had to do to Mao when I was a little girl was worship him and sing songs about him.
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:22.160]  I mean, this is getting really sick, Bob Chapman. Well, I think the program is accelerating and
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:29.280]  the reason it is, is because we've accelerated and we have informed the public and more and
[3:39:29.280 --> 3:39:34.080]  more people are catching on. And so that's why they're doing what they're doing. I think what's
[3:39:34.080 --> 3:39:40.000]  going to come out of this G20 meeting more than anything else is things that they're not talking
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:49.360]  about. And that is setting the government and the financial system up for a fall. It's hard to tell
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:53.680]  what date they're going to pick. It could be in three months. It could be in a year and a half.
[3:39:54.800 --> 3:39:59.360]  You know, they have their own schedule. Yeah, their meetings scheming to engineer an even bigger
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:04.400]  implosion as they've admitted in the past to then poses the saviors saying, give us even more power
[3:40:04.400 --> 3:40:09.440]  or we'll have martial law. You know, if they have martial law, I don't know who's going to do it
[3:40:09.440 --> 3:40:15.520]  because the lower and the middle echelons of the military all know what's going on. And they,
[3:40:15.520 --> 3:40:19.040]  Bob, I don't know though. I know a lot of them are awake, evidenced by Ron Paul getting more
[3:40:19.040 --> 3:40:25.200]  contributions than any other political candidate in 2008. But these cops and military seem to enjoy
[3:40:25.200 --> 3:40:30.720]  beating the hell out of women, especially for no reason in L ratting small children. I mean,
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:36.720]  it seems like they want to destroy their country. Well, I'm sure there's always some who will and
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:42.400]  perhaps they were chosen to do the work that they're doing because of their viciousness. I don't
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:48.320]  know. I know that the average military person does not want to go around beating people up,
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:55.760]  particularly women and doing things which are unlawful. And I think we're going to get a lot
[3:40:55.760 --> 3:41:00.160]  of support from the military. And I think this may end up as a military coup.
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:08.400]  Well, Bob, let's, and then I'm going to play this children worshiping Obama clip. I played it a
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:11.840]  month ago. But again, now it's national news. People are emailing saying, why aren't you covering
[3:41:11.840 --> 3:41:16.160]  it? Because we broke it. Like I get emails saying, why haven't you covered my act? We broke it.
[3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:21.120]  Not bragging. It's just that that's an example of how this radio show pretty much more than any
[3:41:21.120 --> 3:41:26.320]  other outlet now, but with a lot of other great folks as well is now driving the news. What we
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:31.760]  break and cover weeks later, months later is then covered by the mainstream media that shows the
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:40.320]  power of this audience. It certainly does. And it is a powerful audience. And it's up to them to
[3:41:40.320 --> 3:41:45.760]  keep on doing what they're doing and getting to everybody in America and informing them who
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:52.560]  the enemy of all the people is, not some political party. We ought to, we have to all come together.
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:41:57.280]  And that's in every country because everybody is experiencing the same thing in countries
[3:41:57.280 --> 3:42:02.960]  throughout the world. And so we got to make this thing stick. And the more people who know who the
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:10.800]  enemy is, the least chance that they have of being successful. Believe me, I do not believe
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:16.800]  that the military are going to work against the American people. But we saw these two staged
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:22.000]  terror stings where the FBI cooked the bomb, the fake bombs in both cases and found one
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:25.520]  lone nut idiot. It's probably informants. They're probably setting them up. We know they've done
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:29.680]  that in the past. Or it could just be a mental patient. In the case of 93, World Trade Center
[3:42:29.680 --> 3:42:32.960]  where the FBI cooking the bomb, trading the drivers and ordering their informants to stand
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:37.840]  down and let it happen. I think if they staged terror attacks and things, though it might help.
[3:42:37.840 --> 3:42:44.480]  Well, you're always going to find people who applyable for that. I mean, when they did the
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:55.600]  tests and the surveys some 20 years ago, they found that there were 10 to 15% of the military
[3:42:55.600 --> 3:43:00.720]  who would do heinous things. And you're always going to find just like we have criminals in
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:07.360]  society. I mean, if you have 15 hired anarchists run up and throw some bottles at the cops,
[3:43:07.360 --> 3:43:09.840]  then the cops will go ahead and open up with rubber bullets.
[3:43:10.800 --> 3:43:16.560]  Well, I have a question about that, Alex. And the question is, do you believe that the anarchists,
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:22.640]  the supposed anarchists are being trained and put into the positions they are by
[3:43:22.640 --> 3:43:28.800]  the people who control our government? Here's the answer. In hindsight, in every case, it's been
[3:43:28.800 --> 3:43:38.000]  proven mainstream Toronto Star, National Post, Denver Post, Seattle Times, Genoa, England,
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:45.040]  G20 this year, killing the paper delivery guy. In every case, it's come out confirmed the police,
[3:43:45.040 --> 3:43:54.000]  the FBI or hired foundation people are doing it. And so we don't know yet. We rarely catch
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:59.040]  him right at the time, but it always comes out later. In Canada, people followed the police car
[3:43:59.600 --> 3:44:03.360]  saw him let him out a block away and were taking their outfits off and they had police boots on
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:08.000]  and the royal amount of police had to admit it. But yes, I've watched the video and you'll have
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:12.560]  a bunch of idiot meth head kids who are with them, maybe one 10th to 1% of the total crowd,
[3:44:12.560 --> 3:44:17.200]  a few morons because the feds go and recruit patsies. But you see it, these are cops and
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:22.240]  informants and state police officers that are doing this. And their argument is we neutralize
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:27.120]  a dangerous crowd by creating the pretext. It's kind of like you put out an oil well fire with
[3:44:27.120 --> 3:44:31.040]  a stick of dynamite. They say, well, we're knocking this out. These protests are dangerous.
[3:44:31.040 --> 3:44:35.280]  The terror threat is real. Men, we got to go out and stage an event to keep everybody safe.
[3:44:35.920 --> 3:44:41.360]  And that's what they do. And there are those elements that will always do that.
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:48.960]  We have elements in society will always do those kind of things. And so we have to expect it.
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:55.040]  And I, you know, I've listened to you talk about this before, but I wanted to bring that fact out
[3:44:55.040 --> 3:44:58.960]  to put it in people's minds up front. If you hadn't mentioned it earlier, and I don't know whether
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:04.080]  you had. The point is, we got to know that this, the public is going to know that this
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:09.440]  anarchist reaction that you see all over the media right now, they're not calling in terrorists
[3:45:09.440 --> 3:45:14.880]  anymore. They're anarchist. It's all planned that way. It's all propaganda.
[3:45:14.880 --> 3:45:22.880]  Well, the police heard everybody to a certain spot. Then the anarchists come out then turn over a
[3:45:22.880 --> 3:45:27.840]  trash can, throw a rock, and then they had, and then the anarchists always pull back the police
[3:45:27.840 --> 3:45:32.800]  weight. They'll even see anarchists and we've caught this on tape. They'll do a hand signal
[3:45:32.800 --> 3:45:38.960]  and then they move back and the cops open fire. That's right. So we want the public to know
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:44.000]  that, that this is all planned. It's planned by the power behind our government.
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:48.720]  Well, they want to delegitimize all these tens of thousands of peaceful people. They do it with a
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:54.880]  handful of scum. And it's just, but what would the police and the corrupt system do without the
[3:45:54.880 --> 3:46:00.000]  anarchist thugs? They would have to attack people that had done nothing. And then Hitler staged an
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:04.960]  attack on his own base to attack Poland. It's Operation Northwoods, the same deal, Operation
[3:46:04.960 --> 3:46:10.880]  Gliwitz, Operation Ajax. It's declassified. I want to play this worship piece of Obama. Then I want
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:14.560]  to come back and get into a little bit on the economy, what you see happening the next few
[3:46:14.560 --> 3:46:19.680]  months in the year with the G20 and why they're announcing their world government. But here is
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:24.720]  one of many videos, the kids are in uniforms in some videos, chanting city year and military
[3:46:24.720 --> 3:46:30.320]  outfits, red and black uniforms, climate cops, Boy Scouts trained to spy on their parents and
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:34.880]  to quote, take on disgruntled veterans, New York times. It's all happening. But here are the
[3:46:34.880 --> 3:46:42.880]  children literally worshiping Obama like we're North Korea.
[3:47:04.880 --> 3:47:33.680]  Did you hear that hit pause? Did you hear that quote from Jesus loves all little children,
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:39.760]  then they do battle him or the Republic. But then it now it's Obama comes marching on. See when
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  Obama said he wants to start speaking to the kids and on telescreens, on big TV screens,
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:49.040]  the original curriculum said to teach them to serve him and work with him. Then he backed off
[3:47:49.040 --> 3:47:53.440]  and said, Oh, just be an anti-drug speech. This is the Sovietization of America. Bob,
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:48:02.960]  German. Absolutely. It's mind boggling and it's mind washing. What do we do about this?
[3:48:04.160 --> 3:48:11.040]  All we can do is expose it. Congress won't do anything. The Senate won't do anything.
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:17.600]  And we'll have to do the best we can until the die is cast. And when that happens, the whole
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:22.800]  thing's going to blow sky high. And it won't be only be in America. It's going to happen all over
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:27.600]  the world. Well, I mean, this is classical tyranny. They're hitting on all cylinders,
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:32.720]  secret police, militarized police saying you can't march or demonstrate attacking people,
[3:48:32.720 --> 3:48:38.560]  provocateurs, open world government, foreign banks looting us. Bob Chapman, I mean, they're
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:45.600]  openly 8,000 plus articles today in Google News. Today, 8,000 newspapers are reporting world
[3:48:45.600 --> 3:48:49.440]  government is here and how wonderful it is. And the Obama is now president of the planet.
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:57.120]  And that will continue because they own the media and we're fighting them from the other side.
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:49:04.720]  And it's not going to stop. And, you know, it's just like with the financial thing.
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:07.360]  We don't know when they're going to pull the plug, but they're going to pull it.
[3:49:07.360 --> 3:49:15.680]  We also know that they're going to use biological warfare to, what would I call it,
[3:49:15.680 --> 3:49:20.640]  classify the people so they won't run and get the gun to defend themselves,
[3:49:20.640 --> 3:49:24.800]  that they'll just sit around and wait for somebody to collect them because they're ill.
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:29.280]  That's right. It's a perfect soft kill operation to make everybody stand down.
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:32.720]  For the police and military that don't know what the new order means for them,
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:36.720]  they are always the most preyed upon group once the takeover has happened.
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:43.200]  Well, just to go back to what Henry Kissinger said, generally paraphrasing him,
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:47.920]  they're dumb animals, you know, they're cannon fodder.
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:51.920]  Yeah, he said military men are dumb animals and published it.
[3:49:53.520 --> 3:49:56.480]  Well, I just showed you the disdain and arrogance that they have.
[3:49:57.920 --> 3:50:03.360]  You know, let me tell you something, no matter what happens to people, they're not going to make it.
[3:50:04.160 --> 3:50:06.640]  The people behind the scenes who are causing this.
[3:50:07.440 --> 3:50:12.720]  It's just that we're going to pay a terrible price as humanity because we wouldn't listen.
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:19.360]  Generally speaking, and they're going to lose because people will, there are certain people
[3:50:19.920 --> 3:50:24.480]  and all we need is five to 10 percent of the population who refuse to live in their knees.
[3:50:26.640 --> 3:50:30.160]  We're going to go out with a battle, him and the Republic with the children worshiping Obama
[3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:43.280]  with his name and place of the Republic will come back with Bob Chapman on the economy.
[3:51:01.120 --> 3:51:05.200]  Have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power?
[3:51:05.200 --> 3:51:08.880]  If so, this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear.
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:13.520]  Solar power generators are now available from Solutions from Science in Thompson, Illinois.
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:18.080]  These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you need it most.
[3:51:18.080 --> 3:51:23.520]  Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes and produces electricity
[3:51:23.520 --> 3:51:28.080]  for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home. Run
[3:51:28.080 --> 3:51:32.880]  some pumps, shortwave radios, computers and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's
[3:51:32.880 --> 3:51:37.520]  hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:42.800]  power outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator
[3:51:42.800 --> 3:51:51.440]  from Solutions from Science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com
[3:51:51.440 --> 3:52:00.960]  or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[3:52:02.160 --> 3:52:07.520]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:13.120]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:18.560]  like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[3:52:18.560 --> 3:52:23.200]  the best interest of the American people. Well, Obama's already fudging. Yeah, fudged
[3:52:23.200 --> 3:52:27.920]  since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of
[3:52:27.920 --> 3:52:35.200]  personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs,
[3:52:35.200 --> 3:52:42.400]  that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government. This film
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:49.680]  documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda. Get your copy of the
[3:52:49.680 --> 3:52:56.880]  Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[3:55:17.680 --> 3:55:23.040]  Bob Chapman, In Closing, The Economy. Things aren't going well. They're starting to drop.
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:28.160]  They're takeover of healthcare. A lot of their entire agenda is stalling. Do you think they're
[3:55:28.160 --> 3:55:31.840]  going to stage terror attacks? What is the establishment going to do? And what do you
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:37.360]  see happening in the economy? Well, they have the problems, as you just mentioned,
[3:55:37.360 --> 3:55:41.840]  cap and trade as well, which they're pushing very hard now with the President's speech,
[3:55:41.840 --> 3:55:48.960]  as well as Clinton getting up there and running around in his hind legs. And next, we've got
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:55.760]  the turmoil that's going to occur during the month of October from this wine flu situation.
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:56:03.120]  I hope you got my email. And also, we're going to have the dollar down at around 7118 in the
[3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:12.720]  USDX. It's currently around 77. And what's going to happen is that they're going to tell you,
[3:56:12.720 --> 3:56:19.680]  and they are in the process of doing so, that they're going to start removing all of this money
[3:56:19.680 --> 3:56:26.720]  and credit that they have injected into the system. And that cannot happen without the entire
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:33.520]  economy collapsing. And so, I don't think they're ready yet to go for it. It's going to happen
[3:56:33.520 --> 3:56:37.360]  in probably in the next year and a half. I don't know when, but I don't think...
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:40.880]  So, it's kind of like the hesitation at the edge of a 200-foot cliff
[3:56:40.880 --> 3:56:45.120]  about to jump into the water. They're kind of hesitating, getting everybody ready,
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:49.840]  sending up trial balloons. Tell people what it will look like if the dollar is dumped.
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:57.600]  There will be an official devaluation, probably one new one for three old ones.
[3:56:58.560 --> 3:57:05.200]  There will be a default on debt that will be coordinated entirely by a meeting such as the
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:12.000]  Smithsonian, and then later in the 80s, the Plaza Records. And they will revalue and devalue
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:17.440]  all currencies against one another, and they will probably chop off two-thirds of the debt,
[3:57:17.440 --> 3:57:22.720]  and the debtors will pay back one-third. How that will affect individuals within
[3:57:22.720 --> 3:57:27.040]  individual economies, I don't know. I know what the logical thing to do is,
[3:57:27.040 --> 3:57:33.440]  but goodness knows they may not use the logical thing, which is to reduce debt by the same amount,
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:39.760]  domestically. And that's what we get coming as far as money and credit is concerned.
[3:57:39.760 --> 3:57:44.480]  How do you protect yourself? You got to be in gold. It's the only place, gold and silver.
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:48.240]  But what you said is key for laymen that don't understand.
[3:57:48.240 --> 3:57:51.520]  Institutions and big globalist groups are going to have their debt forgiven
[3:57:51.520 --> 3:57:55.600]  and a devaluation of currency, but they're probably going to keep all the maximum debts on
[3:57:55.600 --> 3:58:00.960]  us, keep increasing taxes, and just billy club it out of us like the sheriff of Nottingham
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:05.760]  in the days of Robin Hood. Absolutely. That's probably the way they'll go.
[3:58:07.280 --> 3:58:12.080]  And the people are in for it, and the police are being brainwashed like attack dogs against us
[3:58:12.080 --> 3:58:15.520]  right now, theinternationalforecaster.com. We'll link to this big breaking news
[3:58:15.520 --> 3:58:19.680]  at prisonplanet.com on the flu that Bob was just telling you about. Bob Chapman,
[3:58:19.680 --> 3:58:25.040]  thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me, and thank everybody for listening.
[3:58:25.040 --> 3:58:29.040]  You bet. You can go to theinternationalforecaster.com and get a free copy of this newsletter.
[3:58:29.040 --> 3:58:33.760]  It's excellent. Please go preorder follow the republic. It's going up in the next hour at
[3:58:33.760 --> 3:58:38.480]  infowars.com, follow the republic.com. See you back live this Sunday. Retransmission with Dave
[3:58:38.480 --> 3:58:44.160]  Mustaine and a lot more coming up right now at infowars.com. America's number one stories for
[3:58:44.160 --> 3:58:52.480]  independent talk radio for over a decade. We are the GCN radio network. Have you ever wanted to
[3:58:52.480 --> 3:58:57.280]  generate your own supply of electrical power? If so, this is going to be the most important message
[3:58:57.280 --> 3:59:02.080]  you will ever hear. Solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in
[3:59:02.080 --> 3:59:06.640]  Thompson Illinois. These emergency backup systems provide life saving electrical power when you
[3:59:06.640 --> 3:59:11.840]  need it most. Unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no fumes, and
[3:59:11.840 --> 3:59:16.480]  produces electricity for free. It's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own
[3:59:16.480 --> 3:59:22.480]  home. Run some pumps, shortwave radios, computers, and even keep food from spoiling. Whether it's
[3:59:22.480 --> 3:59:27.600]  hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or blackouts, you'll never have to suffer through painful power
[3:59:27.600 --> 3:59:32.720]  outages again. When the power goes out, you'll be ready. With a solar power generator from
[3:59:32.720 --> 3:59:41.280]  solution from science, go to mysolarbackup.com and get off the grid today. That's mysolarbackup.com
[3:59:41.280 --> 3:59:50.960]  or call 877-327-0365. 877-327-0365. Don't wait. Call today.
[3:59:50.960 --> 3:59:59.680]  Coast to coast and in your face. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
