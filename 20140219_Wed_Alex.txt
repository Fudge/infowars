[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:33.240]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:33.240 --> 00:38.920]  the scenes were something out of Dante's Inferno and it's still ongoing more than
[00:38.920 --> 00:46.240]  10 miles of flame in downtown Kiev the capital city of the Ukraine the battle
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.600]  ground between the Anglo-American New World Order and the collapsed former
[00:50.600 --> 00:58.440]  Soviet attempted world order and you have the George Soros CIA globalist
[00:58.440 --> 01:03.920]  funded groups many of which have real beefs with the government absolutely
[01:03.920 --> 01:09.680]  going wild absolutely attacking and shooting police they've stolen
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.400]  thousands of quote firearms from the military and police calling for the
[01:15.400 --> 01:19.960]  country to join the EU they're mad that the government a few months ago there
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.400]  was also a vote in their parliament did not enter the EU listen I don't want to
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.080]  join Russia or the EU how about we have sovereign countries again that aren't
[01:29.080 --> 01:33.160]  dominated by corrupt kleptocratic empires the bottom line here is just
[01:33.160 --> 01:40.400]  like the Syria civil war it is the West quarterbacking and running this entire
[01:40.400 --> 01:48.400]  operation and it is absolutely incredible under law folks when you start the
[01:48.400 --> 01:58.760]  preemptive war you're the bad guy aka Hitler aka Mussolini aka so many other
[01:58.760 --> 02:04.120]  examples that we know of historically like Napoleon the list goes on and on the
[02:04.120 --> 02:08.000]  British Redcoats coming to confiscate the guns and shooting people this is the
[02:08.000 --> 02:21.240]  real issue that we're dealing with and it is so frustrating to see neocon
[02:21.240 --> 02:25.600]  organizations and the so-called left in this country as well calling them freedom
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.040]  fighters ladies and gentlemen when in most cities in the US if you peacefully
[02:30.040 --> 02:33.200]  go out and demonstrate you'll get arrested or beat up and that's all
[02:33.200 --> 02:36.520]  wonderful but when these people are throwing mall off cocktails on police
[02:36.520 --> 02:41.640]  that have been very restrained in the last month of this and shooting them and
[02:41.640 --> 02:47.120]  then the police fire back and by the way it's an elected government that's not
[02:47.120 --> 02:53.480]  even pro-russia I should add but did not join the EU to be absolutely imploded
[02:53.480 --> 03:03.320]  and now the EU is calling for sanctions on Ukraine just like they did on Serbia
[03:03.320 --> 03:07.000]  to then further depress it and break it up and break the country into multiple
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.520]  pieces this is incredible balkanization European Union told they're gonna hold
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.200]  emergency meetings of foreign ministers as leaders warned sanctions are likely
[03:16.200 --> 03:19.800]  following latest clashes that's right just like there'd be sanctions in Egypt
[03:19.800 --> 03:22.520]  if they didn't let the Muslim Brotherhood take over and then start
[03:22.520 --> 03:26.440]  crucifying them Christians and blowing up their churches and again it's not that
[03:26.440 --> 03:32.840]  I back the military junta in Egypt it's a lot better than al-Qaeda and again why
[03:32.840 --> 03:37.640]  is our government involved why are they backing it why do they start the war in
[03:37.640 --> 03:43.160]  Libya start the war in Syria and put people conservatively more than 10
[03:43.160 --> 03:47.680]  times worse in who then destabilize the whole region pour out of Syria now into
[03:47.680 --> 03:54.720]  Iraq retook Fallujah and are killing the Iraqi military and US advisors I mean
[03:54.720 --> 04:00.400]  this is a policy of chaos and George Soros and Brazilian Ski and all these
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.600]  anti-russian types are right at the middle of it folks starting wars on the
[04:05.600 --> 04:11.200]  steps of Russia just like Napoleon and Hitler and it is wrong wrong wrong
[04:11.200 --> 04:16.720]  wrong wrong and the British Empire has been trying to bring down Russia for
[04:16.720 --> 04:23.240]  300 years they've been allied with them back and forth world war one you name it
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.840]  but this is a total double-cross in 1917 putting the both fix in we should
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.680]  apologize to the Russians do you know where the commies came from our
[04:33.680 --> 04:39.720]  government look it up 50,000 brigade level multi brigade how many brigades of
[04:39.720 --> 04:44.960]  50,000 that's that's a whole bunch like ten of them sent out of New York
[04:44.960 --> 04:50.480]  communist paramilitary money out of London to overthrow Moscow folks and
[04:50.480 --> 04:55.440]  then kill tens of millions of people our criminal elite did that they created
[04:55.440 --> 04:59.320]  the stinking cesspit that is Russia
[04:59.960 --> 05:04.200]  the globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda they

[08:26.760 --> 08:38.200]  all over the world governments are falling all over the planet populations
[08:38.200 --> 08:42.600]  are rising up and burning down large parts of their cities burning down
[08:42.600 --> 08:47.280]  government buildings and then killing ethnic minorities as soon as the
[08:47.280 --> 08:54.120]  government's been removed and in every case whether it was Libya or Tunisia or
[08:54.120 --> 09:02.760]  Egypt or Syria or what we're seeing unfold in other parts of the world it is
[09:02.760 --> 09:10.320]  the globalist it is the Ford Foundation Google and others who later brag and it
[09:10.320 --> 09:17.280]  comes out that they are the ones who are out there funding the organizations to
[09:17.280 --> 09:24.320]  start the rioting to begin with and the big think tanks admit in the last few
[09:24.320 --> 09:27.720]  years and we've covered it here on air and even traveled to England to cover
[09:27.720 --> 09:33.200]  it at the very same hotel where Google met secretly with MI6 and others to plan
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.600]  the Arab Spring the Banksters are devaluing currencies worldwide that
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.280]  only hurts you if you live in America or live in say England but if you live in a
[09:44.280 --> 09:51.240]  place like Egypt and 55% of your disposable income that might be six
[09:51.240 --> 09:59.120]  hundred seven hundred dollars a year is food and food prices double what happens
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.760]  if 55% of your money in 2010 in Egypt we can look up the numbers this is one
[10:05.760 --> 10:12.880]  example they're spending 55% of your money on food and then suddenly over the
[10:12.880 --> 10:17.440]  next few years it doubles do the math that's a hundred and ten percent of your
[10:17.440 --> 10:24.280]  money you begin to starve ladies and gentlemen look at the Egyptians they're
[10:24.280 --> 10:32.840]  very skinny now they weren't just a few years ago they are starving the globalist
[10:32.840 --> 10:39.560]  have actuaries on record they know with these computer programs wargamed on
[10:39.560 --> 10:41.960]  record they know when you're gonna order it Amazon before you order it and
[10:41.960 --> 10:45.040]  already ship it okay and tell me about this for a long time now it's mainstream
[10:45.040 --> 10:49.720]  this not because I'm smart it's been all in all the MIT papers for decades but
[10:49.720 --> 10:53.120]  that was their holy grail that they've attained it in the last decade and now
[10:53.120 --> 10:57.120]  they can game everything they know how to manipulate oil prices food prices you
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.840]  name it to make a country blow up and they know when it's gonna blow up so
[11:01.840 --> 11:05.640]  they show up a month before it's gonna blow up and they know how it's gonna
[11:05.640 --> 11:13.320]  blow up with a pro-liberty egalitarian awakening movement in Egypt that is
[11:13.320 --> 11:17.040]  gonna put down the Muslim Brotherhood and even put down the government
[11:17.040 --> 11:20.760]  control and create a golden age in Egypt there was a lot of stuff lining up for
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.280]  that with a lot of youth that had you know gotten into freedom and things and
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.280]  the system said we're not gonna let that happen just like they didn't in 53 and
[11:28.280 --> 11:34.200]  Iran when pro-america mozadek was in there they put in the radical jihad
[11:34.200 --> 11:40.240]  he's overthrowing then they doubled cross them and put the shawl in just like
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.120]  they put al-qaeda into Libya because they were helping Africa Libya was
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.480]  building up all of Africa like a real IMF would do and and working with the
[11:48.480 --> 11:51.360]  West and Gaddafi bought into all of it was meeting with all the European
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.080]  presidents and had apologized for stuff and invested most his money with big
[11:55.080 --> 12:00.000]  US banks they set him up folks he opened up everything built big hotels was
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.160]  giving money to all of Africa he'd live in a tent but I'm not romanticizing
[12:07.160 --> 12:10.000]  Muammar Gaddafi but compared to our leaders you know he's the real deal
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.760]  self-made ladies and gentlemen and actually spent 99% of the dictator
[12:14.760 --> 12:19.800]  wealth on the people not allowed ladies and gentlemen not allowed they put
[12:19.800 --> 12:23.680]  al-qaeda in there they put burkas back on the women's heads and they killed all
[12:23.680 --> 12:29.400]  the minority Muslims and the blacks in the country on record 40,000 blacks
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.480]  lined up and shot or chopped up with machetes by the al-qaeda people out of
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.320]  Saudi Arabia are extremely anti-black that's why I never get why a lot of
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.200]  blacks are big Wahhabist and follow up chicken part of Islam in those groups
[12:43.200 --> 12:47.400]  because man I've read their writings on black people it makes the Ku Klux Klan
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.200]  sound pro-black you want to go read it yourself if you want to I'm not gonna
[12:52.200 --> 12:57.640]  repeat it on air but though I guess I'm racist I'm not I don't want to kill the
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.920]  black people but anyways the whole point here ladies and gentlemen is that
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.840]  that's what's going on in Kiev right now and I saw on Fox News last night with
[13:07.840 --> 13:10.840]  Shepard Smith when I got off the show in the afternoon I knew there was fires
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.880]  going on for weeks this river of flame we found one from the air but that's
[13:14.880 --> 13:19.600]  small it was at nighttime and it went for 10 miles with us with the buildings
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.600]  and the skyscrapers and just went on and on hundreds of feet of flame going
[13:24.600 --> 13:28.560]  for miles like a Dante's Inferno we're trying to find at the cruise doing a
[13:28.560 --> 13:33.400]  great job or digging around for it and we can just go Tevo Shepard Smith show
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.240]  from yesterday they had it up on that big jumbo tron and it was incredible where
[13:38.240 --> 13:43.600]  he was pointing it all out and they're calling them protesters and freedom
[13:43.600 --> 13:49.720]  fighters in our news and ladies and gentlemen these people are shooting the
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.360]  police preemptively they've been given weapons obviously and I'm a pro-second
[13:53.360 --> 13:56.060]  amendment guy if they were overthrowing a communist government I'd say hooray
[13:56.060 --> 13:59.720]  hooray if they were overthrowing an unelected government I'd say good good
[13:59.720 --> 14:05.480]  for you they're not it's an elected government that didn't vote to join the
[14:05.480 --> 14:11.360]  EU a month ago and all hell broke loose and the EU on record is to come in take
[14:11.360 --> 14:15.240]  over your country hand over all the infrastructure and bankrupt it on record
[14:15.240 --> 14:20.920]  I mean who wants to join the EU that's like joining a sinking ship but it's all
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.480]  about taking down Russia people go well good we need to take down Russia folks
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.680]  the globalists are taking us down with agenda 21 our farms our ranches our
[14:29.680 --> 14:34.760]  businesses our power plants we don't want to be part of the criminal elements
[14:34.760 --> 14:38.400]  of Wall Street and the Bank of England and others that are wrecking all these
[14:38.400 --> 14:44.040]  different countries this is very evil this is economic warfare and believe me
[14:44.040 --> 14:48.920]  folks if the police in this country are ordered to go out and confiscate guns
[14:48.920 --> 14:53.680]  civil war like this times let's not exaggerate we're a lot bigger country a
[14:53.680 --> 14:59.680]  lot bigger population let me be conservative civil war of this I'd say
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.680]  50 times this is by the people aren't just gonna start burning trash cans and
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.360]  stuff patriots libertarians conservatives don't ever protest you
[15:08.360 --> 15:15.560]  notice because when they do they protest like 1776 and it's it's not gonna be
[15:15.560 --> 15:18.680]  pretty and the globalist actually want to maneuver this and this is what I want
[15:18.680 --> 15:22.880]  to explain to you today what we're seeing in Kiev and what we see going on
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.640]  there and what we see happening there is a microcosm of how the globalist
[15:27.640 --> 15:37.040]  operate they don't usually invade your country they don't usually come in with
[15:37.040 --> 15:41.720]  an overwhelming force openly the bushes did that and that was against the main
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.560]  globalist policy but the establishment let them do it as a test they do it by
[15:46.560 --> 15:50.240]  fomenting opposition and overthrow groups and Balkanization and
[15:50.240 --> 15:54.000]  destabilization programs then they take over that country and use it the next
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.080]  phase to exploit to the next country try to infiltrate and overthrow it that's
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.960]  how the globalist operate through subversion it's on record and they
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.480]  have already created the last 60 years through the different foundations the
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.800]  Carnegie the Ford Foundation mainly on that case teaching that the Southwest
[16:13.800 --> 16:17.200]  belongs to Mexico teaching that whites are inherently racist in all the high
[16:17.200 --> 16:20.320]  schools all the colleges I went to college I went to high school I was
[16:20.320 --> 16:22.960]  taught that in Dallas I was taught that in Austin in high school I was taught
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.240]  that at community college and so I didn't go to main college every class it
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.480]  could be math it could be US history it could be psychology I was taking a bunch
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.560]  of courses see what I liked it was white people are bad America's bad the
[16:34.560 --> 16:37.880]  Southwest belongs to Mexico and we're gonna have a communist takeover and
[16:37.880 --> 16:41.080]  we're gonna take the guns and all of you white people should be ashamed of
[16:41.080 --> 16:46.240]  yourselves this was all coming out of white people's mouths and when I wrote
[16:46.240 --> 16:50.800]  papers against it they would give me F's and I would write misspelled as a test
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.640]  screwed up ones worshiping communism and stuff as a sick joke I did a few times
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.200]  they'll give me a pluses and invite me for coffee afterwards and I said that's
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.200]  it I'm out of here I'm going to go do an access TV show the only place I can get
[17:04.200 --> 17:09.880]  on air I'm gonna fight these people and now you see the universities you see it
[17:09.880 --> 17:18.280]  everywhere I mean it is just incredible what is going on so that they can then
[17:18.280 --> 17:21.880]  have the riot start up whenever they want in this country you don't just
[17:21.880 --> 17:24.640]  think they're going to come for the guns then leave it at that and have a
[17:24.640 --> 17:27.720]  civil war over that no no they're gonna stage some race stuff and get the
[17:27.720 --> 17:32.960]  Southwest burning and then it'll be oh there'll be sanctions on the US if they
[17:32.960 --> 17:36.320]  don't let this become its own autonomous zone where they put us into a
[17:36.320 --> 17:40.600]  North American Union when Obama's going to Mexico right now to do and then they
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.600]  always then have a super union with with the old groups the old countries
[17:44.600 --> 17:49.800]  broken up into small little groups within it so globalism is the opposite of
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.480]  unity and the opposite of sovereignty it's totally exploitive totally predatory
[17:54.480 --> 18:00.880]  and so you watch Ukraine will be much worse in a year than it is now if they
[18:00.880 --> 18:03.920]  would have gone under the EU it would have been much worse for them and this
[18:03.920 --> 18:08.880]  is what the government of the Ukraine now gets because they didn't join the
[18:08.880 --> 18:14.160]  EU the incredibly predatory EU and when they voted a month ago remember to not
[18:14.160 --> 18:17.480]  join I said that's it get ready for their cities to burn on record it's not hard
[18:17.480 --> 18:25.480]  you don't join NATO you don't join the EU they're going to overthrow your
[18:25.480 --> 18:31.200]  country just like Serbia that case they brought in radical Wahhabist Muslims out
[18:31.200 --> 18:35.480]  of Albania had them blow up churches shoot little kids on the street the Serbs
[18:35.480 --> 18:40.040]  got mad attacked them I mean I'm not taking sides for the Serbs folks I have
[18:40.040 --> 18:43.800]  no Slavic blood in me I've never been to Serbia I just studied real geopolitics
[18:43.800 --> 18:47.840]  and what actually happened under Bill Clinton and they would have a guy with
[18:47.840 --> 18:51.760]  tuberculosis wanting into a food food tent that had wire around it and time
[18:51.760 --> 18:55.040]  magazine and Newsweek and all of them would show it and see an end going look
[18:55.040 --> 18:58.320]  at this starving man in a Serb concentration camp it was all lies
[18:58.320 --> 19:02.720]  folks the Serbs in the UN zone numbers lost double to triple depending on which
[19:02.720 --> 19:08.160]  war in the 90s and we're always the ones being attacked just like when the
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.640]  Syrians fight back against the outside Al Qaeda invasion oh it's a horrible
[19:11.640 --> 19:16.720]  atrocity and they brought in the Al Qaeda into the South and they took a third
[19:16.720 --> 19:20.480]  of the country coast of us a drug running around and now they're still
[19:20.480 --> 19:24.200]  attacking up into the rest of the country and and this is how the globalist
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.760]  operate and they bombed Belgrade and the rest of country with depleted uranium
[19:28.760 --> 19:35.160]  why not give old Clinton five peace prizes for that all because it was a
[19:35.160 --> 19:39.880]  sovereign country and they broke it up folks after the fall of the Soviet Union
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.480]  and and you know Tito been dead a long time all that that whole place was
[19:44.480 --> 19:49.760]  getting along fine the whole Balkans where we get the term Balkanization the
[19:49.760 --> 19:53.160]  whole Balkans was getting along until the West came in and did that just like
[19:53.160 --> 19:57.520]  the Middle East this is such an evil divide and conquer policy it is so bad
[19:57.520 --> 20:01.280]  and they're gonna do it here in America
[20:04.120 --> 20:09.560]  curious about what comes next next is the feeling of vulnerability you get
[20:09.560 --> 20:13.440]  after you arrive home to discover your house has been ransacked by burglars
[20:13.440 --> 20:19.320]  fool the bad guys with a new improved fake TV you asked for it we listened and

[20:33.520 --> 20:37.440]  burglars think someone is home watching television they're likely to pass your
[20:37.440 --> 20:42.960]  house and move on to an easier target the new brighter fake TV is only 39 95 and

[24:13.480 --> 24:18.280]  quite a bit about Ukraine probably more than most of the so-called ambassadors
[24:18.280 --> 24:22.400]  Obama sends around but that's not saying much it's on record that most the
[24:22.400 --> 24:26.160]  ambassadors don't even know where the countries are they're being sent to and
[24:26.160 --> 24:32.240]  brag about it and can't speak any of the language and it is very insulting to the
[24:32.240 --> 24:37.120]  people that are having these ambassadors sent to them usually you see an
[24:37.120 --> 24:42.040]  ambassador who's an American citizen but had family there and a culture there if
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.240]  you want to get anything done like if you know the US ambassador to England
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.000]  should you generally be an anglophile and have family in England and you know
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.440]  have some background there and know about British culture or UK culture and
[24:54.440 --> 24:58.280]  it's just an example I mean there's Obama's ambassador to Norway knows
[24:58.280 --> 25:04.600]  nothing about Norway and Braggs he knows nothing about Norway but but I know
[25:04.600 --> 25:10.000]  quite a bit about Ukraine really smart great people that had it really hard in
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.120]  between Europe and those wars and in between the old the czars and then the
[25:14.120 --> 25:20.760]  Russians under communism but this is a new empire of the EU and the globalist
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.680]  teamed up with the Anglo-American establishment coming into takeover and
[25:25.680 --> 25:30.880]  privatize everything and absolutely just drag these people to the mud and
[25:30.880 --> 25:34.640]  there's problems with the government there's corruption there's all the
[25:34.640 --> 25:37.880]  standard stuff there they've been put new governments in every couple years over
[25:37.880 --> 25:42.080]  there this government's just trying to be neutral and it looked like on a lot of
[25:42.080 --> 25:45.280]  fronts was trying to be nice to the Russians and nice to the EU and just
[25:45.280 --> 25:50.680]  trying to have trade and saying we'll just be on our own no thank you the EU
[25:50.680 --> 25:57.440]  looks like a bad deal and of course they activated Soros and I mean Soros is
[25:57.440 --> 26:04.160]  like herpes or something I mean he just is the gift that keeps on giving do I
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.040]  need to say anything more about what's happening in the Ukraine but that George
[26:07.040 --> 26:14.520]  Soros is on record right in the middle of it what an uncool person and look at
[26:14.520 --> 26:18.720]  what they did back in 2008 with the neocons it's the same agenda starting a
[26:18.720 --> 26:24.520]  war with Russia in South Ossetia and of Kasia in northern Georgia we almost had
[26:24.520 --> 26:28.360]  a nuclear war right there and our media said Russia had attacked Georgia they
[26:28.360 --> 26:31.520]  had national news say that I was a collaborator because I came out and
[26:31.520 --> 26:34.680]  said that we attacked the Russians later they had to admit that was the case they
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.880]  ran a hoax folks they could start a war tomorrow with the Russian border
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.960]  territory a new militarized zone they've got a bunch of those and and and we'd
[26:44.960 --> 26:49.160]  have nuclear war and we'd always be told the Russians did it that's how big
[26:49.160 --> 26:53.920]  these hoaxes are that's how evil this government is it's not our government
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.400]  ladies and gentlemen it is criminal elements that are playing all countries
[26:58.400 --> 27:03.880]  off against each other because they can consolidate power during chaos because
[27:03.880 --> 27:11.760]  while the Catholic and Orthodox people are lined up killing each other and
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.720]  attacking each other being manipulated in Ukraine the globalists sit back and
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.720]  laugh just like here it'll be black or white or white versus Hispanic or north
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.360]  versus south or man versus woman or gay versus gray why don't we all just agree
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.160]  on Bill of Rights Constitution due process private property right to defense
[27:29.160 --> 27:35.840]  and be like I'm for freedom and you are a status see people need to be in gangs
[27:35.840 --> 27:38.640]  they need to be in clubs they need to be in tribes they need to be in packs
[27:38.640 --> 27:42.960]  that's how we are but it should be I'm part of the invention pack I'm part of
[27:42.960 --> 27:47.040]  the trailblazer pack I'm part of the honorable pack you know in real business
[27:47.040 --> 27:51.080]  that's still in this country it gets the word gets out oh that's an honorable
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.880]  law firm that's an honorable CPA that's an honorable florist that's an honorable
[27:56.880 --> 28:00.840]  repair guy that's an honorable good painter and you know what they can
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.320]  charge more and they get the business and anyone with a brain works with them
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.400]  and then all the losers just feed on the unwashed masses that don't know what
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.800]  they're doing the most valuable thing in this world is being honorable and it's
[28:13.800 --> 28:19.520]  Dr. Paul Rick Roberts has said many times America in the last decade has lost
[28:19.520 --> 28:25.840]  its soft power we've lost our soft power where people respected us so much
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.280]  that they would basically work with America and that really helped our
[28:29.280 --> 28:34.120]  country nothing wrong with having an empire of ideas an empire of trade an
[28:34.120 --> 28:40.840]  empire of goodwill if it's consensual consensual collectivism is great where
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.120]  we all agree on liberty so we collectivize our will to make the world
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.440]  better but it doesn't mean we collectivize and give up our will to join a
[28:48.440 --> 28:52.320]  collective oh no no no no see collectivists are like the corporate
[28:52.320 --> 28:55.360]  Borg and so as as people that are individuals we think well I won't work
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.040]  with anybody because I'm not a collectivist that that's not collectivism
[28:58.040 --> 29:02.440]  that's teamwork ladies and gentlemen and the minute we figure out the difference
[29:02.440 --> 29:08.600]  between that and and and this in this robo sapien
[29:08.600 --> 29:14.520]  humanoid garbage that is collectivism this trendiness this just accepting
[29:14.520 --> 29:19.400]  whatever the latest propaganda is the minute we do that is the minute we
[29:19.400 --> 29:22.520]  begin to turn the tide now I got a bunch of other news to cover as well and we've
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.120]  got a bunch of big guests coming up today but I'd like to get your take on

[29:30.600 --> 29:35.080]  on for weeks about this and we finally got him on he says it could turn into
[29:35.080 --> 29:38.440]  World War three I agree Joseph Farah to be coming on to talk about a host of
[29:38.440 --> 29:42.880]  issues Obama becoming a dictator and so much more that of world that daily that
[29:42.880 --> 29:47.160]  is all coming up today but I've got some other comments on this as well I mean

[33:15.240 --> 33:21.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[33:21.480 --> 33:33.200]  gcn radio network
[33:43.720 --> 33:48.840]  at one level at a primitive level because governments are so oppressive and
[33:48.840 --> 33:53.320]  out of control in most cases we see the images of citizens in ukraine in the
[33:53.320 --> 34:01.000]  capital city battling and defeating police with mall off cocktails and it
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.400]  looks like 1776 but when you examine it a little bit closer they are shooting the
[34:06.400 --> 34:13.560]  police first with firearms they are raiding military caches of weapons
[34:13.560 --> 34:19.760]  that's professionals folks the CIA that is the criminal elements of it controlled
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.000]  by the globalist and George Soros are over there involved in this to take down
[34:24.000 --> 34:29.960]  the final piece up to the wall with Russia to start a new cold war when
[34:29.960 --> 34:34.240]  Russia is trying to reform and has been reaching out to us that is illegitimate
[34:34.240 --> 34:38.360]  that is fraudulent a major universities have come out with studies just
[34:38.360 --> 34:43.600]  yesterday that the u.s. continues to drop and press freedom just like Russia but
[34:43.600 --> 34:46.720]  economically Russia is going up in economic freedom while we're going
[34:46.720 --> 34:52.280]  down Russia is becoming more free in many ways than we are
[34:52.280 --> 34:55.800]  China is becoming more free in some ways than we are in major studies look
[34:55.800 --> 35:06.320]  I'm up and it is extremely extremely frustrating to see this going on but
[35:06.320 --> 35:10.520]  there are a lot of factoids and learning events we can have within this
[35:10.520 --> 35:16.960]  larger event that are extremely informative to the larger world it's
[35:16.960 --> 35:21.720]  an educational experience a this is how the globalist take down countries and
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.760]  and put in new regimes is they create global economic climates that make it
[35:26.760 --> 35:31.280]  very hard all over the world especially with what you called the poor old world
[35:31.280 --> 35:36.400]  like Ukraine they're poor compared to us it's rough the people just know the
[35:36.400 --> 35:40.480]  government is is in charge hey the EU is going to make it better they promised
[35:40.480 --> 35:45.440]  the majority of Ukrainians don't want to join we don't care that's you
[35:45.440 --> 35:49.880]  Orthodox Christians that are pro-Russia in the east of Ukraine we're going to
[35:49.880 --> 35:53.080]  burn down your churches
[35:53.080 --> 36:01.280]  they are absolutely just playing people off against each other mindlessly
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.520]  mindlessly and the globalist will play muzzlem off against Catholic and other
[36:06.520 --> 36:09.560]  country and you know blow up their churches the globalist don't care
[36:09.560 --> 36:14.000]  they're going after everybody and it's disgusting so this is what they want to
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.560]  do in America all this race politics and race division and you wonder why
[36:17.560 --> 36:22.400]  there's all these mobs of young black people running around beating up whites
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.440]  everywhere and the media tries to cover it up because that's just the beginning
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.600]  of the foaming so that we'll all fight with each other while the globalist
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.840]  rob us with Obamacare rob us with the control of energy and gouging and the
[36:33.840 --> 36:38.040]  power plants rob us with the dumbing down rob us with the fines the fees the
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.320]  taxes rob us with the NAFTA the GAT the TPP all the new trade deals that are
[36:44.320 --> 36:49.880]  just specialized deals but separately militarily you've got a country that
[36:49.880 --> 36:52.960]  doesn't have a second amendment whether it's all very hard to get a gun
[36:52.960 --> 36:57.400]  basically a gunman and you've got the citizens with a little bit of training
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.960]  because you know the CIA guys in the in the five billion dollars they spent in
[37:01.960 --> 37:07.560]  the last year on record guys pull up an article five billion spent by quote US
[37:07.560 --> 37:16.200]  foundations in Ukraine the last 12 months five billion dollars spent in the
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.200]  last year and a couple months it's 14 months since the beginning of 2012 to
[37:21.200 --> 37:26.480]  put in color revolution groups hot showed by the usual suspect he's gonna
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.240]  get your guns and your free speech to I'll get you your little dog to George
[37:31.240 --> 37:37.240]  Soros the Nazi collaborator because he loves you and he's a democratizer no he
[37:37.240 --> 37:40.040]  wants that country to loot the daylights out of it like they've done
[37:40.040 --> 37:44.000]  Greece and Spain everywhere else they won't control that government they want
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.360]  control those national bank accounts they won't control the national assets
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.720]  and they're gonna then use that country to leverage it against all its neighbors
[37:50.720 --> 37:57.280]  they're gonna bring down the bread basket of Europe right now Ukraine the
[37:57.280 --> 38:04.200]  biggest wheat producer in the whole region absolutely insane let me check it
[38:04.200 --> 38:07.480]  out right here I'm gonna pull it up right now I'm gonna go to the old NSA
[38:07.480 --> 38:15.000]  research engine and I'm gonna say five billion five billion we have it
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.800]  America okay global research American conquest by Subversion Victoria Newlands
[38:20.800 --> 38:27.000]  admits Washington has spent five billion to subvert Ukraine that's a quote print
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.480]  that for me and they'll have great bibliography at the bottom it's global
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.160]  research after three visits to Ukraine in five weeks Victorian Newland from the
[38:34.160 --> 38:38.400]  State Department explains that the past two decades no no it's last year the
[38:38.400 --> 38:42.760]  United States has spent five billion dollars to subvert Ukraine and assures
[38:42.760 --> 38:45.800]  her listeners that there are prominent businesses and government officials who
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.600]  support the US project to tear Ukraine away from its historic relationship with
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.120]  Russia and into a US sphere of influence via Europe it's not a US sphere it's a
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.760]  banker's fear and it just goes on and that she's given low numbers at that
[38:58.760 --> 39:06.520]  Exxon event she was at it's five billion the last 14 15 months but I'm digressing
[39:06.520 --> 39:14.200]  imagine the magnitude of that that they're financing this and imagine if we
[39:14.200 --> 39:20.320]  went out can you imagine if a million people took to DC and then started
[39:20.320 --> 39:25.800]  burning things all over the place and and shooting police with firearms they'd
[39:25.800 --> 39:29.640]  have helicopter gunships out killing thousands they would probably nerve gas
[39:29.640 --> 39:33.120]  people that's on record under the Sunshine Project got leaked documents in
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.600]  2000 at the Marine Corps standing by in every region with helicopters in
[39:37.600 --> 39:42.920]  mothballs with nerve gas at the locations ready to be nozzled on to fly
[39:42.920 --> 39:47.880]  around and kill people and they also have opiate bombs which is basically
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.640]  heroin where they fly over and spray that but they say that kills more than
[39:51.640 --> 39:54.960]  10% of people because you fall over and hit your head you wreck your car fire
[39:54.960 --> 39:58.760]  start they say might as well just nerve gas people you can by the way go read
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.720]  those they were they were actually declassified in the Marine Corps freaked
[40:01.720 --> 40:06.000]  out they were reclassified I had to have the project on he got so threatened
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.280]  they shut the project down but then the Marines couldn't get Google to take it
[40:10.280 --> 40:14.240]  off the wayback machine that is Google isn't it look up Sunshine Project
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.640]  helicopters Austin Texas because that's was where one of the plans came out and
[40:19.640 --> 40:24.360]  point is they'd send out you better have heavy-duty hazmat gear folks you want to
[40:24.360 --> 40:27.960]  do what they're doing in DC they're gonna hit you with at least opiate knockout
[40:27.960 --> 40:35.080]  gas aka close encounters of the third kind or whatever it is we know they
[40:35.080 --> 40:39.640]  knock out the whole town so they won't see the space aliens land bottom line
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.920]  ladies and gentlemen that is the plan that is the plan is to use helicopters
[40:44.920 --> 40:50.760]  on you now we got us Congress with a 6% approval rating Obama's openly a
[40:50.760 --> 40:54.800]  dictator Obama's openly trying to train the military that gun owners and
[40:54.800 --> 40:58.080]  veterans of the main enemy they're converting the whole system of the
[40:58.080 --> 41:01.280]  military industrial complex in North com over to go after the American people
[41:01.280 --> 41:05.400]  it's high treason and the American people really have the right and I think
[41:05.400 --> 41:09.040]  the duty until you realize that's what they want us to do to actually do what
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.800]  the Ukrainians are doing everywhere the state governments don't sign on the
[41:12.800 --> 41:15.360]  Republic and announce the federal government's been hijacked and is
[41:15.360 --> 41:18.640]  illegitimate but I don't want people to do that but under the Declaration of
[41:18.640 --> 41:23.920]  Independence you have a right and kind of a pig-headed duty to fight this but
[41:23.920 --> 41:28.160]  see I fight in the info war because as the Pentagon says 90% of war is
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.440]  psychological so I'm talking right to the Pentagon you really want to help
[41:32.440 --> 41:35.200]  bring America down with the foreign banks you really want to be collaborators
[41:35.200 --> 41:38.800]  like VC French no you don't good do whatever you have can delete the
[41:38.800 --> 41:43.320]  tyranny expose it don't go along with it we're gonna stop it just like you did
[41:43.320 --> 41:46.960]  with Syria not backing al-qaeda good job we're gonna stop this together we can
[41:46.960 --> 41:50.200]  do this folks we don't want violence we don't want them to be able to start a
[41:50.200 --> 41:54.040]  civil war where we kill the police and military they kill us then the
[41:54.040 --> 42:00.120]  multinationals come in later as the peace force after America not having
[42:00.120 --> 42:04.240]  power for a year in many areas the public accepted the UN peace force as
[42:04.240 --> 42:10.240]  Henry Kissinger said back in 2000 he said Americans Americans would never
[42:10.240 --> 42:14.800]  accept the UN occupation the New World Order but the big enough crisis they
[42:14.800 --> 42:18.920]  would that believe 70 United Nations peacekeepers in Los Angeles and pull the
[42:18.920 --> 42:27.280]  quote up so that's the issue here and this isn't rhetoric what you're hearing
[42:27.280 --> 42:35.200]  this is the real issue of what's unfolding this is the real issue of
[42:35.200 --> 42:42.000]  what's happening and what's going on and this is the same program they're going
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.000]  to use in us as different permutations different implementations of it and we
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.920]  are just on the brink of the whole world getting more and more unstable as
[42:53.920 --> 43:02.280]  the British Ministry of Defense put out in 2007 in their report the London
[43:02.280 --> 43:06.160]  Guardian carried it its flash mobs and brain chips a frightening view of the
[43:06.160 --> 43:12.280]  future from the British Ministry of Defense that's the actual headlines when
[43:12.280 --> 43:19.120]  pulled up flash mobs and brain chips a frightening view of the future by the
[43:19.120 --> 43:23.320]  Ministry of Defense I had a British Revolution flash mobs and brain chips a
[43:23.320 --> 43:26.640]  grim vision of the future I almost got it London Guardian to get the year right
[43:26.640 --> 43:31.800]  yeah 2007 April 8 and then you can read the whole multi hundred page report when
[43:31.800 --> 43:37.680]  you link through on the PDF and because this is what's being engineered global
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.800]  economic shutdown desperate populations with the globalist there to finance
[43:42.800 --> 43:47.000]  revolutions before the real ones start and then have the revolution then be
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.520]  dialed back in to even more globalist multinational control oh you don't like
[43:52.520 --> 43:59.160]  how you're poor now in Ukraine let's the EU come in will make it better EU comes
[43:59.160 --> 44:04.200]  in a couple years later they bankrupt even more let the EU openly appoint your
[44:04.200 --> 44:09.520]  presidents and leaders now we'll fix it the public goes along suddenly the
[44:09.520 --> 44:14.080]  public doesn't oh my gosh your neighbor declared war on you in recent
[44:14.080 --> 44:20.040]  decades worldwide social change has experienced unprecedented historical
[44:20.040 --> 44:26.520]  acceleration particularly because instant mass communications such as radio
[44:26.520 --> 44:34.120]  television and the internet cumulatively have been stimulating a universal
[44:34.120 --> 44:43.200]  awakening of mass political consciousness the resulting widespread rise in
[44:43.200 --> 44:51.000]  worldwide populist activism is fully inimical to external domination of the
[44:51.000 --> 44:59.760]  kind that prevailed in the age of colonialism and imperialism persistent
[44:59.760 --> 45:06.040]  and highly motivated populist resistance of politically awakened and
[45:06.040 --> 45:12.200]  historically resentful people's the external control has proven to be
[45:12.200 --> 45:19.320]  increasingly difficult to suppress as protracted guerrilla warfares in yet
[45:19.320 --> 45:27.720]  now Algeria or Afghanistan have amply demonstrated and as the rising turmoil
[45:27.720 --> 45:34.440]  in both the Middle East and South-West Asia are foreshadowing that's the big
[45:34.440 --> 45:38.640]  difference key acting like all the things are happening they're not behind it so
[45:38.640 --> 45:43.040]  again they know about the awakening so they're going to hijack it before it
[45:43.040 --> 45:47.520]  happens it's like red a dare would detonate TNT the famous oil well fighter
[45:47.520 --> 45:54.760]  on top the oil well with a bigger explosion to knock out the explosions so
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.120]  that's how they describe it they know when a country is about to melt down
[45:58.120 --> 46:01.320]  because they're manipulating the economics of it they have the
[46:01.320 --> 46:05.520]  supercomputers on record they go in with their revolution groups that are
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.960]  standing by to go the answers more government and more gun control and more
[46:09.960 --> 46:14.640]  open borders and more taxes that'll make it great look I'm trendy they
[46:14.640 --> 46:18.720]  literally hire trendies and and buy off local news reporters and people to be
[46:18.720 --> 46:22.560]  part of the movement to act like they're against the government to then get
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.840]  control that group stays in a few years gets paid off acts like their
[46:27.840 --> 46:31.680]  opposition against the new revolution group so they just create synthetic
[46:31.680 --> 46:35.760]  revolution that's why the revolution can't be just a new revolution a new
[46:35.760 --> 46:41.000]  group it has to be an idea so that there's a manifesto so that ours is
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.240]  Declaration of Independence Bill of Rights Constitution it goes past religion
[46:45.240 --> 46:49.560]  race hey I want my private property I want my due process I want my privacy I
[46:49.560 --> 46:53.720]  want my own children I want to run my own life as long as it'll hurt anybody
[46:53.720 --> 46:58.920]  else I want to be free and I don't want government taking my tax money and
[46:58.920 --> 47:02.960]  giving it to select groups to build monopolies you just right there
[47:02.960 --> 47:07.000]  enshrined everything that is true liberalism true veritas true
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.760]  constitutionalism called right-wing hardcore extremism today the
[47:10.760 --> 47:14.880]  labels mean nothing ladies and gentlemen what we have is a criminal
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.840]  kleptocratic global cabal using high-tech delphi techniques and other
[47:19.840 --> 47:24.960]  social engineering to manipulate the population I only got this next segment
[47:24.960 --> 47:28.880]  one more before LaRouche comes on I want to hear from people serious callers do
[47:28.880 --> 47:36.280]  you disagree with me on Ukraine but I mean can you imagine if we were shooting
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.760]  police like that what they would say notice these globalist funded
[47:41.760 --> 47:45.400]  revolutions always burns them stuff shoot some cops a real revolution would
[47:45.400 --> 47:49.800]  be marked down where all the globalists live and then just have an idea like
[47:49.800 --> 47:53.800]  beef or vendetta where you all go one day and do something it's an idea you
[47:53.800 --> 47:58.040]  can't stop it you can't find the cells there are no cells these aren't real
[47:58.040 --> 48:01.520]  revolutions they don't want to teach real revolution you know what our
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.720]  founders did once they started coming after us once they started sending out
[48:06.720 --> 48:15.160]  death warrants on patriots their death warrants on them two-way street oh no
[48:15.160 --> 48:19.640]  we're all taught go shoot a cop just some random cop out there good that's how
[48:19.640 --> 48:22.880]  you have a revolution or George Soros he's go pop shoot a cop in the head and
[48:22.880 --> 48:27.800]  then oh it's a hero all this other that's how communists roll folks that's what
[48:27.800 --> 48:33.560]  this garbage is and it's wrong it's globalist funded from the bowels of hell
[48:33.560 --> 48:37.840]  ladies and gentlemen know your enemy identify who's behind it you want to
[48:37.840 --> 48:40.200]  talk about violence and I don't want that to happen I want to be in the
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.240]  info war but I want to show the police who are getting these armored vehicles
[48:44.240 --> 48:48.440]  and all this preparing for war what'll happen with a crowd even of Soros
[48:48.440 --> 48:52.320]  morons what they can do with mall off cocktails and fire you know the police
[48:52.320 --> 48:55.960]  roll in these armored vehicles and try to stop the protesters burning down
[48:55.960 --> 49:02.960]  buildings and they all sit there by the way I mean it's so cowardly you've got
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.680]  the the military there and the police they've got a machine gun on top they
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.040]  don't even open fire they've been told not to and they roll in to try to stop
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.280]  them setting fires and they throw fire all over the armored vehicle and it
[49:15.280 --> 49:19.720]  burns up and blows up obviously cooking the police inside I mean listen I'm
[49:19.720 --> 49:23.560]  rolling up and I've got a heavy machine gun on top of my armored vehicle you're
[49:23.560 --> 49:29.000]  throwing mall off cocktails at me I'm an open fire on you period and that's what
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.280]  I'm telling you the police have been told stand down stand down show all this
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.480]  can happen because the government knew it was unpopular to join the EU I told
[49:36.480 --> 49:39.800]  you this weeks ago they're playing patty cake they're involved in this folks
[49:39.800 --> 49:46.880]  they're encouraging this takeover you watch this is rotten rotten rotten
[49:46.880 --> 49:51.800]  rotten but the point is is that your armored vehicles aren't going to help

[55:03.800 --> 55:08.400]  because the Ukraine wouldn't sign on to the EU and be politically taken over I
[55:08.400 --> 55:13.640]  image Saruman the wizard talking to Gandalf and he says I tried to have you
[55:13.640 --> 55:19.720]  aid and join me willingly but you have chosen the path of pain and that's
[55:19.720 --> 55:23.320]  basically what they've done to the Ukraine and it's totally lawless it's
[55:23.320 --> 55:26.960]  totally illegal it's it'd be like if the Russians were trying to get in
[55:26.960 --> 55:31.840]  Mexico to break up and you know become an enemy of the US or something it is
[55:31.840 --> 55:36.880]  it is absolutely bad guy behavior and it's not even our government it's
[55:36.880 --> 55:41.280]  George Soros and the foundations that have already hijacked us that's the
[55:41.280 --> 55:49.920]  thing it's all done in our name it is outrageous and they will do the same
[55:49.920 --> 55:53.600]  garbage here ladies and gentlemen there's Kurt Nemo's article Soros
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.760]  supported protesters turned violent Ukraine protesters want country to
[55:57.760 --> 56:05.000]  integrate with European Union that's right join with the big superstate or
[56:05.000 --> 56:09.520]  will burn and shoot everyone that's far and sedition ladies and gentlemen I
[56:09.520 --> 56:13.480]  don't care what the protesters were saying we're gonna burn everything if
[56:13.480 --> 56:17.680]  you don't join this political group from the outside that's globalism that's the
[56:17.680 --> 56:22.480]  new world order they come finance an idiot group a minority of the people in
[56:22.480 --> 56:28.000]  Ukraine to burn everything if people don't go along with this it's outrageous
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.280]  and our media calls them freedom fighters it's like they called the serve
[56:31.280 --> 56:40.560]  rebels the Muslims heroes and they called Al Qaeda and Syria heroes cops
[56:40.560 --> 56:45.640]  tased death man waving having diabetic attack now all I see articles every day
[56:45.640 --> 56:48.680]  where somebody's passing out or having a diabetic attack or death or mentally
[56:48.680 --> 56:51.960]  retarded and they beat them up or kill them Bush era diplomat says Ukraine

[57:18.960 --> 57:24.760]  police start staring us in the face very important article by dr. Paul Craig
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.960]  Roberts gonna one call the more calls the next segment we got raptor man
[57:28.960 --> 57:34.800]  calling from New York we got Tom and Marilyn Judy Haboo Julio and others
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.640]  Tom thanks for calling in your retired police officer you want to comment on
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.600]  Ukraine what do you think of what's happening good afternoon thanks for your
[57:43.600 --> 57:49.160]  position on pointing out that we as police can also get caught up and be
[57:49.160 --> 57:54.440]  victims as well I'm a retired cop I also work with the Netherlands national
[57:54.440 --> 58:00.200]  police force in the 90s for a period of time and cops everywhere have a lot in
[58:00.200 --> 58:04.680]  common I've not been to too many countries where you find a lot of
[58:04.680 --> 58:10.160]  differences you have a few bad apples but for the most part police are
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.120]  citizens who are simply trying to do their job it's a perfect segue though I
[58:16.120 --> 58:21.240]  wanted to point out so fortunate right now in America that we have a judicial
[58:21.240 --> 58:28.080]  system that allows us to wage a real quote-unquote civil war on paper and I
[58:28.080 --> 58:34.600]  think would be great with your platform if you could have some focus on what we
[58:34.600 --> 58:37.840]  as individuals can do I tell us stay there and I want to get your take on
[58:37.840 --> 58:40.880]  Ukraine we're coming right back stay there don't hang up our raptor man we'll
[58:40.880 --> 58:47.560]  go to Tom then we'll go to Judy then we'll go to Haboo and Julio and we'll get you one
[58:47.560 --> 58:54.280]  way or another in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple
[58:54.280 --> 58:59.720]  foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations
[58:59.720 --> 59:04.320]  around the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride ladies and
[59:04.320 --> 59:08.960]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[59:08.960 --> 59:14.400]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[59:14.400 --> 59:20.080]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[59:20.080 --> 59:24.360]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line
[59:24.360 --> 59:30.520]  iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the

[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.400]  alex jones
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.480]  all right we're going back to we were talking to raptor man or tom and
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.600]  Marilyn I was Tom and Marilyn then we'll go back to raptor man I got the
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.240]  names mixed up okay Tom make your point about Ukraine then and then talk
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.320]  about how we can use the judicial system the court system I agree it's
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.920]  actually very powerful people just don't know their rights and don't use it
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.920]  we've gotten to this position because we because we become very jellyfish like
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.040]  a free people will be free people that act like sheep will be slaves but go
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.760]  ahead and give us your take on Ukraine first two quick points on that and I'll
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.960]  jump right into the court system real fast as far as Ukraine is concerned
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:22.480]  who knows who may have caused the first outbreak of violence that may not have
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.680]  been justified certainly when it gets to this point nobody's gonna win in the
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:31.080]  situation like that not heard you say it before I think most people realize
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.520]  that when it gets to the point where you're throwing bottles and you're
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:41.600]  killing people nothing good is going to come from that there's the outlet even
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:46.160]  if you if you're in a country where there's not a judicial system utilized
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.120]  like we're lucky enough to have you still have words and you can still appeal
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:57.280]  to a basic human common sense and most people are going to be receptive to that
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:05.200]  I've been in situations where myself and my partner were outnumbered and the
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.080]  crowd could have crushed us could have done what they wanted to you look for
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.000]  somebody who's in the position of leadership within the crowd because
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.440]  they all have one or two usually more and you appeal to their basic sense of
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.840]  being a fellow here my point have you seen the images of riot police that are
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:27.560]  just standing there being shot by the so-called freedom fighting protesters I
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.680]  mean my issue is imagine if we had protesters shooting police what our
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.760]  media would say it just shows how this is all being run by criminal elements in
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.000]  this country and in in the EU as well and how it's a total double standard I mean
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.480]  I want to be called a freedom fighter because I go out and have a pro-second
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:49.480]  amendment rally not you know some extremists or get arrested meanwhile
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.400]  these people are shooting police that have done nothing but because they want
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.840]  to burn down the government building and again I don't like seeing police
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.240]  shooting people that are unarmed and I don't like watching people shoot the
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.720]  police and I've got to say the Ukrainian police are extremely restrained
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:09.320]  because let me tell you I don't care if I was a cop or not you start shooting me
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.600]  I'm gonna shoot at you and it just really upsets me I appreciate your call
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.280]  Tom you're right we should talk about more ways to wage war peacefully the
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:23.680]  voting box the ballot box the grand jury box the soap box I mean there's just so
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.760]  much we got to do here but the image of George Soros funded people shooting
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.760]  riot cops I mean 10 feet away boom and there's like a hero oh you're such a
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.440]  hero no you're you're you're worse than a cop beating some woman with a billy
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:43.200]  club so I like bullies folks and and the police have been extremely restrained
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.560]  over there and now all hell's breaking was let's jam in one more then we'll go
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.280]  to a raptor man Habu and Julio inside of the interview with it's all on Ukraine
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:58.880]  with Lenin LaRouche we'll get to talk to him Judy go ahead hi Alex I think one
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.200]  of the things that needs to be brought to the forefront maybe is the port of the
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.400]  Vestpaul in the Black Sea if people don't understand the gravity of the
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.240]  situation of Russia actually losing that port that it's a huge indicator of just
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:21.600]  how important this this whole massacre in yeah this is what it really is all
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.080]  about because they don't want to lose their port Russia does not want to lose
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.280]  that port and the other thing I just want to say real real quick is that I
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:35.280]  think in terms of what how we need to talk to men in America I think there
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.720]  has to be a bit of compassion only because we've been you know so prosperous
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.320]  and this is such a horrific turn of events that is that is taking place in
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:50.720]  our nation that they're not necessarily jellyfish as much as they are they're
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.320]  scared out of their wits and they don't know what to do with it I'm like you're

[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.480]  all hell broke loose there in the country with Soros backed NGOs trying to
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.280]  destabilize the country we now see arms being served up to the so-called liberty
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:08.280]  loving freedom fighters as they're being called on our news to shoot the police
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:13.000]  that have been until now very very restrained again folks you know that I
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.520]  am not a rusky file I don't have some darling love of the Russian government
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.880]  or any of those systems I do have a liking for peace and not having nuclear
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.800]  war and I also like common law and common sense and I wouldn't like the Russians
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.800]  trying to foment sectarian violence to break up Mexico and start a civil war
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:42.520]  there to destabilize the United States we have the State Department minions I
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.920]  have the articles right here we're gonna talk a little arousia about it in just a
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:50.600]  moment openly bragging that they've spent five billion dollars to destabilize
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:55.880]  the country America conquest by subversion victoria newland admits
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.200]  washington spent five billion to quote subvert Ukraine there's there's video of
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:07.760]  that and this is serious situation we saw him try to start war in 2008 with the
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.120]  Russians we've seen them in Syria try to hand that over to al-qaeda they know
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:15.040]  revolutions coming because of world economic meltdown they want to
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.080]  preemptively start it in my view to try to bring chaos out of it so they can
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.200]  then poses the saviors I mean that's really what it comes down to and it's
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:28.320]  extremely immoral that Congress a few weeks ago passed a resolution praising
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.400]  the violent demonstrators and saying the government should just let them take
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.160]  over again I try to study the Ukrainian situation the world's very complex
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.000]  place I'm not saying the government's perfect but they're trying to remain
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.520]  neutral this is one of the biggest geopolitical things in a long time right
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:51.000]  now and it's part of a proxy war with Russia make no mistake Syria was about
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.360]  that too and George Soros is in there is always stirring things up and a man
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.280]  who multiple directors of central intelligence said had one of the best
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.800]  private intelligence networks in the world you can look that up was linen
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.280]  LaRouge he was read by Ronald Reagan you name it some call him a leftist some a
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.760]  right-winger the media always demonizes him just with the term all LaRouge so
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.560]  that you won't look into what he's actually said and done the analysis is
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:21.520]  spot-on you could disagree with some of the solutions but they've been calling
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.360]  this stuff before it happens and he joins us right now to break this down
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:31.760]  thank you for coming on sir but first off you heard my little my little lay
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.400]  out there of what I think is happening do you think that's accurate a and then
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:42.320]  be expand on it what's what are we facing here it needs a lot more there's a
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.480]  this is a much bigger thing what you focused on is first of all the the
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:53.240]  perception of the Ukrainians which are involved in the events in approximate
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:59.400]  in that area were Nazis they were part of the Hitler operation in their
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.080]  lifetime and these are children of the Nazis the we have to remember that the
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:10.720]  there was a certain section of working for Hitler which were part of the
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.880]  Hitler system they killed a lot of Ukrainians themselves but they also
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.880]  killed a lot of Poles the assassinations of Poles under Hitler were done
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.040]  largely by these particular Ukrainians who were part of a Nazi system if you
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:32.960]  look at their costumes as they wear at home the costumes of those of Nazi
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:39.320]  insignia their origin is not see and so what you have is you have the United
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:47.920]  States government now is actually supporting these Nazis at new london
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:54.320]  is one of the key supporters of these Nazis they are still Nazis their record
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.720]  of killing Poles during World War two is enormous this is the same people they
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.160]  wear the same costumes the same insignia the same like legacy and by the way you
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.400]  are in World War two I should also add that it's amazing how long you've been
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.200]  speaking out it's just amazing and I know that is a part of the right-wing
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.840]  group being fun about the CIA you are correct sir and they're trying to split
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.400]  between Catholic and then of course Orthodox it's more pro-Russia but what's
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  the big geopolitical and why is this such a serious situation because it's
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:31.760]  nothing to do with Syria as such or things like that these are byproducts
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.840]  of a much larger scheme of things what we're on the verge of is World War three
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.280]  thermonuclear World War three and that's the big problem we have to try to
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.800]  defeat now there are other problems that come in as very features of this
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:51.320]  problem but as as far as I'm concerned as long as Obama remains president we're
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:56.960]  in danger of being involved in a matter of you know a few weeks or day even days
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:03.880]  of thermonuclear war globally that's what we are and you know what my interest
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.600]  here on this is partly just inside the United States itself this presidency is
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:14.520]  destroying our nation and it's getting us into a thermonuclear war which we want
[01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:18.800]  no part of in which our real military people want no part of either there's
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:22.280]  no reason for a thermonuclear war as a matter of fact it will actually cause the
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.200]  extinction of the human species or something like that and a lot of
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.240]  mainline analysts as you know are saying this could trigger nuclear war with
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:35.280]  the Russians explain that to people then what is oh but what you have is when
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.280]  the United States fell under the influence of certain presidents such as
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:46.760]  George W. Bush Jr. and Obama we were dealt we were dealt the dirtiest hand
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.480]  ever occurred and this has something to do with the way that the reasons why
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:54.880]  Bill Clinton was framed up and it was a framework but that's a whole story in
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.600]  itself but when he left office we lost Glass-Steagall law and that was the
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:06.280]  first thing that was done and the glass of Glass-Steagall has destroyed the U.S.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.080]  economy ever since it's been getting worse and worse and worse now our
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.240]  objective should be to get our Glass-Steagall law and not have our
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:20.040]  help so being run by the British Empire through the Wall Street and the Wall
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.200]  Street gangsters are the real inside problem here and Obama is nothing he's
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.240]  not he's astute he's not really the president he's a president named but
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:32.360]  he's astute for these in these international interests well yes sir I
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:35.800]  understand that when I brought up Syria I mean it's part of the Brzezinski type
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:41.120]  great game continued proxy war to take every country that Russia has a port in
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.760]  to get up against Russia's borders to fund radical Islam along Russia's
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:51.160]  borders I mean from what I've seen the West is trying to foment a takeover in
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.600]  Ukraine to get them to join an anti-Russian coalition and are you saying
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.040]  that's what could lead them to weapons being moved into Ukraine and then
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:05.000]  escalating crises with Russia. The Russia thing is really in a sense
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.520]  minor on this business we the world has been divided in terms of power between
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:16.840]  two regions of the planet one is the transatlantic region of the power which
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.960]  goes into Europe then you get the area from Belarus on toward Asia and apart
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.320]  from some terrorist areas in the Eurasian region that's that's the
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.280]  right line that's all therefore you have the British Empire and Obama is
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.280]  nothing but a stooge for the British Empire and Wall Street is the key
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:41.200]  element here Wall Street is essentially a British intelligence operation is a
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.680]  financial one and it's the one that's ruined the United States so what happens
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.800]  is the thing has come to the point that Wall Street and Burton are about to go
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:57.440]  bankrupt that is the use of bailout as a policy which was done under actually
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:02.800]  started with young Bush and continued with Obama but bailout has ruined the
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:09.400]  US economy obviously now we could cancel bailout but that would require a
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:15.880]  decision to do that but the point is what's coming now is bail in which is
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:23.040]  the next stage of bailout bail in would cause in of itself a total immediate
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:26.160]  collapse of the USA for those that don't know they've already done it in Cyprus
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.840]  and other areas they're saying they're going to take money out of our bank
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.640]  accounts to prop up the zombie bank something you warned of a decade ago or
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:37.360]  more just what I'm saying again to Linda one Rouge World War two vet you name it
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.840]  just amazing to have him here with us there's so few world World War two vets
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.200]  left much less one so eloquent Linda when I'm trying to get out here with you as
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:49.280]  I understand it's a bigger global issue but as the world depression
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.040]  acceleration are going to have these uprisings then the Anglo-American British
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:59.560]  Empire is going to try to use those to foment even more breakdown so I'm saying
[01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.880]  is geopolitically why are you saying it's a danger of thermal nuclear war
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:08.280]  because it is I give explain it to you the what you have is you have a division
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:16.040]  of the world now into two parts the Anglo-American system of the transatlantic
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.880]  system the northern hemisphere in particular and that is bankrupt the
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.120]  United States under present system is totally hopelessly bankrupt and what
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:32.200]  the bankruptcy has been the buildup of this bailout system especially from 2008
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.560]  from that point on was the real point where the became it under young bush
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.920]  normally on bush and it got worse under Obama it's become much worse now what's
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.640]  happened is the British Empire and the British are an empire they're not just
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:52.720]  Britain they control frankly all of Africa they control under the euro system
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.040]  they control most of Western Europe and that that's the kind of situation so you
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.720]  have a situation where the world system is divided into two sectors one in the
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:08.680]  northern hemisphere is the transatlantic region and the United States is now a
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.120]  puppet of the British Empire under the current current president we could get
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:18.600]  back to a real president opposed to young bush and Obama we could probably get
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.000]  our nation back but the point is the investment this investment system of the
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.440]  British Empire including Wall Street itself is such that they are about to
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.840]  go bankrupt immediately they're on the verge of it now what their option is is
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:42.640]  knowing that the bail in is coming on and they do know that bail in needs a
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.280]  general collapse of the US economy I mean a monetary collapse not a breakdown
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:54.280]  not a depression a collapse so what their object is to say well look the
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:59.560]  Eurasian sector of the world that is the wealthier part Russia China India so
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:04.840]  what these parts are growing whereas the United States has been declining
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:11.720]  economically in physical economic terms since essentially the time that Jack
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:17.320]  Kennedy the John F. Kennedy was was ousted from office assassinated since that
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.320]  time in the start of the Indochina war we have actually is what MacArthur
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:27.720]  warned about this thing we have actually been in the process of decline there
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:33.080]  has been never any economic recovery in reality in the United States there are
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.440]  some people who become rich but you'll find that the employment levels the
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:41.680]  quality of life offered to people you know and look for example let's take
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:46.800]  one very good example of this fracking now I'm sure you're coming from Texas
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.680]  you know all about fracking and we know that the fracking which is a British
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:56.080]  operation is is now destroying the western part of the United States it is
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:02.480]  actually taking using water driving it down in order to bring up gas and the
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:09.320]  gas they're bringing up is actually they is actually destroying the region
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:14.360]  west of the Mississippi we have the two the two leading states of the United
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:19.120]  States Texas and California are going into destruction now there's another
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:24.280]  little complication in this which and there always are complications in this
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:29.280]  case the problem is that the Sun our solar system has gone through what's
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:34.200]  called a quiet period that means that the radiation being supplied to move
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:40.080]  earth is less than it was before and under these conditions we have the
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:44.320]  greatest drought in the western part of the United States in probably five
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:50.680]  hundred years the state of Texas is dying these industries are being shut
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.200]  down the same thing is true in California and the other states between
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.960]  but you take California and Texas if you knock them out of the US economy you're
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:06.240]  going to have a total collapse in the US economy so therefore we have a great
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.800]  crisis is caused by the policies which have gone through by under certain
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.360]  presidents particularly since Bill Clinton was taken out of office the rate
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:18.880]  of collapse has reached such a point and the hyperinflation under the bailout
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:26.520]  system has reached such a point that it's now about to blow up and bail in will
[01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:30.280]  be the trigger which causes an instant collapse now what's the solution then
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:35.120]  from the standpoint of London and people like that the point is that while the
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:39.040]  western part of the world the transatlantic region has been collapsing in
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.960]  physical economy for all this period ever since Jack Kennedy was out was
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:50.840]  assassinated at the same time gradually in recent times the Eurasian part like
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:59.720]  Russia you know China India so forth are coming up so therefore the plan is to
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:05.560]  try to crack the balance of forces between the transatlantic region and the
[01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:11.920]  Eurasian system now what that means is if they could get into this one area which
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.480]  is in your southern part of the Ukraine and if they could knock that out then
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.760]  by using US forces based in that area they could think they could knock out
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:27.520]  the Ukraine area and that knocking out Russia by an outflanking operation now
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:34.160]  what this is this puts us on the edge of a thermally war the war is between two
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:40.680]  forces now the transatlantic region and the Eurasian region the Eurasian region
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:45.520]  includes nations like China 1.4 billion people and a powerful nation
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:54.880]  India 1.2 billion people and so forth and Russia is not insignificant so when
[01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:01.280]  you take these forces together and you say that the British Empire which thinks
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:06.080]  it's controlling the entire planet which is stealing our oil stealing our
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:11.200]  food in the United States and doing all these things to us that this this process
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.400]  means that the only way that the transatlantic region that is the British
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:21.320]  Empire in particular could survive is by gobbling up and destroying and conquering
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:26.240]  Eurasia now when you talk about think about what the military forces are in
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:33.840]  China some in U.P. forces in India in Russia you think about the military
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:40.400]  transit the similar kinds of forces in the Europe and in the United States we
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:45.280]  have the greatest assembly of thermonuclear deaths ever conceived on
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.200]  this planet and what's coming to a point is the entire planet is going into this
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:58.360]  war my concern is to stop that war and these what these Nazis are doing these
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:05.320]  Ukrainian Nazis are doing is simply the intended detonator of a global
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:11.640]  thermonuclear war now we have people in the United States including our military
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:17.320]  who are against it my point is if Obama President Obama was thrown out of
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:22.080]  office now as he should be for reason and I think there are about 20 counts
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:28.280]  against Obama for violation of the Constitution he's hyper so you know you
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.960]  can be thrown out of office immediately and he's hyper weak but the
[01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:34.760]  Republican leadership won't do it let me ask you this question because you have a
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:38.440]  lot of sources and again if you're a new listener the media the control state
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:43.360]  remedial go all in LaRouche haha for 20 years before I did research on LaRouche
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.600]  and would read their publication 20 years ago but I've read the Washington
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.160]  Post articles and I'm not kissing up to him I'm just telling folks he's a very
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:54.200]  interesting guy going back to World War two doing all sorts of interesting stuff
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:59.480]  there in the Medical Corps from when I read and connections into OSS and then
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:05.320]  suddenly pops up and is giving weekly briefings at the CIA to the director and
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:09.080]  the presidents and and then the bushes get jealous of him and having thrown in
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:14.720]  jail over you know made up crooked toenail my issue is he's not a guy that
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.520]  will brag about himself he really is interesting no matter what you think
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.720]  about Lyndon LaRouche and so much of what he says is just so piercing and
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.400]  thought-provoking I know you have huge connections out there so what I'm saying
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.480]  is I was told by a high-level commander that they they dug up hidden nukes and
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.160]  dies there for space three months ago disappeared them then suddenly they
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.680]  fired all these newt commanders Lindsey Graham said get ready for where the nukes
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.000]  have been sent to be blown up I mean I know this is real my source doesn't know
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.120]  you know why they were digging him up where they were going they weren't
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.440]  supposed to be there that if they're purging the entire military leadership
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.920]  in the nuclear department do you have any intel Lyndon LaRouche about what
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:58.440]  that's about exactly said is that it's the people who will go along with the
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.760]  British line now I don't think the Joint Chiefs in general will go along with
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:06.840]  the British line but as long as Obama is the president of the United States
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:12.760]  despite the fact he has about 20 counts for his immediate impeachment and this
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.240]  is not just an impeachment to be thrown out of office this is the people would
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.920]  be thrown in jail no I know but do you have any obviously if anybody had will
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.080]  he could be put in prison but the establishment wants him there to become
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.960]  a dictator to set the precedent of a of an executive dictator who you vote in
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:31.440]  who then acts as a dictator outside of their constitutional purview but what
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.360]  I'm asking you Lyndon LaRouche is this what do you know anything about the
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:44.480]  missing nuclear weapons I know that the what's happened is we're under in our
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:50.320]  government and you have this Snowden affair which exposes it we're under the
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.520]  greatest degree of fraud and fake secrecy about what we're going on in our
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.960]  own government ever before and this has been specifically the Obama
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:05.080]  administration my argument is this if you want to get understand what we what
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.040]  the problem is you have to look at what we have to do to solve the problem and
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:15.000]  the problem is for me I I can say because there's a rage building up in the
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.760]  Congress and members of Congress they want this bomb out of office now and we
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:24.560]  have about 20 particular occasions for throwing him out of office
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:28.720]  summarily and only throwing him out of office but throwing him into prison
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.640]  yeah why won't they it's open and shut it's not that it's not that closed the
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.760]  we see the surge of revolt against this process is in process we have not won the
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:47.480]  war but we're fighting it we are fighting to save the United States and to
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:53.600]  prevent a thermonuclear war now if you know what a thermonuclear war is because
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:57.840]  this is not a nuclear war this is a thermonuclear war with modern weapons and
[01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.840]  modern capabilities that the minute that war goes to place and both sides of
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.680]  the power the transatlantic fight and the duration side they have the greatest
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:13.400]  concentration of some of the power you ever serve you ever imagined and if they
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:20.160]  go to war they're going to go to full and there probably will be no long-term
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:27.920]  survivors of an hour and a half of a thermonuclear war that's where we are
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:33.800]  my concern is get this bomb out of office the president out of office now
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:38.700]  because that would then derail the whole thing explained to that a little
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:44.400]  ruse is our guest but you look the responsible forces in the United States
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.000]  well stay there sir we gotta go to break we're gonna come right back with you
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.640]  and explain it to us on the other side we're on the march the empires on the

[01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:05.360]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:10.560]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:14.640]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.280]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.720]  and encourage salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:30.400]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:34.680]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:33.480]  pack.com is their main website they've also got LaRouche pub.com and again
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:37.040]  regardless what you think it'll end in LaRouche I mean the guy has been on the
[01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:42.800]  political scene since the 50s he's he's the mainstream media can't even find a
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:48.520]  proper label for him and so much of what he says I know is accurate because I do
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.320]  deep research I mean here's the deal I've got the last name Jones I'm more
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:59.000]  English in my pedigree than anybody else I love English culture the UK the whole
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.200]  nine yards because I'm Scottish Irish the whole you know all of it I'm German
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:10.680]  Alsatian French I'm a Heinz 57 here and but but the the system of the Norman
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.720]  and William the Conqueror and that system became the modern Empire and the
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:20.240]  Imperium and puppet governments and councils on foreign relations and Royal
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.880]  Institute of International Affairs these these corporate governances that
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:28.560]  control government that the British Empire created definitely the ghost of
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:35.080]  the British Empire possesses and runs the Anglo-American North Atlantic Treaty
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:41.960]  conglomerate that ties into the EU that is the dominant force in the world and
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.680]  then you've got the Chinese that are somewhat double dealing with it the
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.160]  Russians are isolated being attacked you got a route for the underdog because
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.320]  they're not doing anything to anybody and I'm not romanticizing it either it's
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.640]  just they're not doing anything to us criminal elements that are trying to
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.120]  impoverish us as political control under eugenics based systems gen 21 what I
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:05.640]  call neo feudalistic serfdom are trying to do the same thing to us they've done
[01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:10.360]  to the Russians before and so I'm for team humanity and really building a
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:14.280]  future a renaissance and I know Lyndon LaRouche is for that as well that's why
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.200]  he's been so roundly demonized for decades and what I want you to give us
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:22.840]  here is solutions but first I want to bring this up because this is a clip
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.240]  from six seven years ago on C-span I happened to be watching C-span in the
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.200]  coffee room back there and caught this on tape it's coming up in the upcoming
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:37.080]  Obama film we're actually getting this British issue because most of our
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:41.120]  leadership Democrat and Republican become knighted later and even get
[01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:45.120]  properties and and money and all these other things and it's a big deal and
[01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.680]  this is what elites relish more than anything is not just becoming a knight
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:53.400]  but a knight commander of the order of bath which is a you know you can walk
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.600]  right into MI6 and give orders if he wants to act like the Queen doesn't
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:00.000]  run anything folks she runs that whole country she tells the Prime Minister what
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.360]  to do she shuts down roads in England every day randomly to exercise her power
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.760]  they're above the law when they're not hanging around with Jimmy Savelle so I
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.200]  want to play this clip and get him to encapsulate what the British monarchy is
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.160]  because it's bigger than the monarchy because then they double back there's
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.680]  this war against sovereignty people we want for the monarchy that gives us
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:22.920]  sovereignty and that's British well they're not even British but I want to
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:26.640]  play this clipping at Lyndon LaRouge's take on it here is Colin Powell walking
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.840]  into reception to go into a dinner with the Queen of England in DC here it is
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:58.400]  there was only one thing bigger than Hollywood in the 20s and 30s and that
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:01.840]  was the British Hollywood and if you watch all those old movies it's all
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.440]  British propaganda and we were taught to hate the French love the British I
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.080]  mean so you can see the programming Pratt Street Council on Fine Relations
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.760]  922 set up to take over our government British intelligence this is a fact now
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.920]  I don't see what's left of the British the British people we're not talking about
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:24.520]  them that's been sucked by this we're talking about the the the the Norman
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:28.840]  class if you want to go back to where this came from still ruling much of the
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:32.480]  world today tied into the Rothschilds Rockefellers and others is that an
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:36.760]  improper analysis from you the grand expert on this Lyndon LaRouge it's
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:42.640]  actually older it goes back to Venetian history of Zeus and Prometheus which was
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.800]  famous in the Greek history and it actually is the model in terms of
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:50.920]  everything in transatlantic culture for example in terms of history break it
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:59.080]  down for us please but yeah so this meaning we're what we're involved in is
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:04.320]  we're involved with two systems one system is against the Roman Empire in
[01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.800]  particular and the British Empire which is formed about the same time that the
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:14.720]  British declared war on are their former colonies are the same thing this is
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:20.240]  this is as an old-standing thing this is what is called an imperial empire it's
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:26.560]  not a national thing their national national interest is over the part of
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.800]  the game that played the whole game but the issue is it's the same thing is
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:37.400]  what Columbus affected to the influence of Nichols and Cousins on him that we
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:44.800]  sent people across the oceans to colonize in the area across the Atlantic
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:51.120]  Ocean in the hope because Nichols of Cousins was this great priest who gave
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.760]  this we created this policy to cross the oceans because Europe was a mess and
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:00.840]  what happened is the this this happened Columbus's discovery was part of this
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:07.200]  process and what became the United States was an expression of recognizing the
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:13.000]  terrible conditions of Europe now for a great period of time we find that since
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.120]  the United States was established and was being established we had much
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.640]  support for the United States and his cause from Europe but what's happened
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.480]  is the Roman Empire now which is now brought up is the British Empire because
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:34.480]  that occurred at the same time that we got into our war with what became the
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.360]  United States because the British Empire had taken over and was determined to
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:45.640]  become a world empire so other nations supported us in our revolution to create
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:51.200]  our United States on that basis but since that time the British Empire has
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:55.560]  again and again tried to control us they've controlled us from inside me for
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:00.520]  example the York City is a center of this pollution of the British taking over
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:06.080]  Manhattan through the international British control banking Wall Street is
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.000]  a product of that Wall Street is actually a British agency it is not an
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.040]  American agency and my condemnation is to get back to a
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:21.920]  Glass-Steagall system and bankrupt these characters and we could do it if the
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.760]  will were there we are now going bankrupt we have the state of Texas is dying
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.720]  the state of California is dying it will go on for years to come unless we do
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.680]  something about it and I say we have to do something about it and the question
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:42.680]  is can we in the United States by getting Obama thrown out of power and he
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:48.480]  is 70% of the American people want Obama eliminated for power I'm one of the
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:55.040]  first get this guy out of there if we do that we can take measures to save our
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:41:02.480]  country and if we if the United States is not included there's not tools to put
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.920]  it itself involved in a war with with the British interests against the
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:13.920]  the Eurasian interest if we don't this we don't go into such a war there will
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:18.360]  be no such war and what I'm concerned about pull Obama out of office right
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:24.040]  now you've got about probably 70% of the voters want him out of there let's get
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.280]  him out of there sure sure quantify why it's important to get him out what
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:33.080]  signal it sends how you believe it will derail this whole out of control
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:38.000]  downhill avalanche that's happening exactly we can do it and that's what I'm
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.800]  working on and I find that there are increasing number of people who have
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:47.000]  been know me for a long period of time and you know they used to duck me because
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.360]  they say you're right but don't tell anybody I told you so and I and these
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:55.520]  are from leading people circles and I do work with leading circles
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:42:00.280]  internationally and in the United States I do that and I have a special role to
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.040]  play because of my forecasting capability and by the way I'm not getting you to
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:07.320]  talk about yourself but it but it's really unknown out there other than a
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:10.920]  few Washington Post Washington time articles and things from the 80s when
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.080]  Ronald Reagan was reading your stuff and when you were visiting the CIA every
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.560]  week landing in your own helicopter everybody was real jealous the
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.520]  Washington Post said and and then of course you're it said your connections
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:25.480]  back to the OSS we did World War two that's all shadowy talk about yourself
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:28.400]  a little bit because you are a very interesting person Lennon tell us how
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.600]  you got into these international circles and why multiple CIA directors we
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.040]  can pull them up if folks want to I forget the main one said you quote had
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.600]  the best private intelligence network in the world I mean that's pretty
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.520]  interesting and then meanwhile most people just here Lennon Rouge I heard
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:50.920]  he's crazy because CNBC said so or MSNBC said so I would pay the attention to
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.720]  foolish people no no no I know but I mean I don't like to talk about yourself but
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.520]  you know you're 90 years old now you've had this great life I mean tell us how
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.760]  did you get into these power circles and and I mean really who are you know I
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.960]  just happen to be I didn't like the education system I was exposed to in
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.920]  schools I thought it was stupid and I was right and therefore I became
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:16.600]  successful and unpopular at the same time because I you know I never would I
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.920]  would never submit I don't believe that we have teachers who are supposed to
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:26.680]  tell us what to think we're supposed to have teachers to guide us into making
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:32.120]  discoveries of our own and we're testing those discoveries and that sort of
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.840]  process so I mean for a long time I you know I hated Euclidean Germany I
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.760]  despised it I was right absolutely correct it's stupid you still have
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:46.000]  people who believe in that nonsense but so therefore I had developed these
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.360]  scientific capabilities and I became a consultant in the 1950s that was a
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:55.920]  very important consultant at one point and then I got into the fight with the
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.920]  FBI and the FBI was not pleased that I would not obey them and so I had some
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:05.560]  periods of troubles then but I was still doing what I was doing and then I had a
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:12.480]  forecast in 1958 that I made and said that you know or said 5868 really and I
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.880]  said well you would through about two or three years this whole thing is blowing
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.480]  up your whole Wall Street system is going to blow up and came along the 70
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:26.360]  you know 1971 and the summer of 71 and blew the whole thing blew up so there
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:31.000]  was a big discussion then about that and I was invited to debate all these
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.920]  characters of Wall Street and in their offices in meeting we had it this you
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:41.960]  know December 2nd of that year and I was right and I've always been right on
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.280]  this and what's happened is I've always really been even against the British and
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.840]  Wall Street crowd their conception of economy is destroyed the United States
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:56.400]  so I've been against it and they bounce me down but I still still myself and I
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.080]  do the same thing I do I don't change because they bounce me down a couple of
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:04.680]  times they got tired of me with fretting when I was you know Reagan and so what
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.800]  Ronald Reagan cleared the way that I should lead the FBI program and that
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.400]  involved international forces leading forces in Italy
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.920]  as right as it's on record that you're one of the original people to call for
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:21.320]  it but as a way to have international force to actually stop asteroids and
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:26.000]  Reagan liked that idea because that would help sell it I guess no no he was
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.800]  actually Reagan was actually two things he was a president and a lot of our
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.920]  presidents have an opportunity to side to them as I think you know some of them
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:40.160]  are good otherwise and Reagan was off for those cases he was not the greatest
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.880]  genius among our presidents but he was a he was a very serious figure he was
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:50.800]  close to the Franklin Roosevelt circles in his time he was a native officer a
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:55.400]  flying officer so to speak in that period during that wartime period and
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:46:03.080]  well by my basis in terms of social basis was lodging from my experience with
[01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:09.200]  World War two I was no significance in that period as such but I was associated
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  with the OSS for example of life later at a later time I was didn't know them as
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:19.720]  OSS men but they came to me in a later point of life and gave all veterans of
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:25.800]  the OSS surviving veterans and they became a key part of the Reagan
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.720]  administration and therefore I was the one who musted this international
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:36.560]  campaign for a strategic defense initiative and I'm still in the same
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.520]  same kind of commitment with a little change in technology I'm now worried
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:45.480]  about how we're gonna deal with the moon I want to get some thermonuclear power
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.760]  here in this this planet of ours at the new level which we discoveries on the
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:55.840]  moon show that we can do and I want to get it's a program of economic
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.200]  development which I think will be sufficient given even a few a handful
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:04.920]  rather a handful of scientists but you've got to do a handful of very good
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.880]  scientists working together on thermonuclear fusion enhanced by by
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:16.520]  helium-3 you do that you can take up a handful of scientists in various
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:21.120]  nations and you can build the greatest power of progress for mankind that ever
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.600]  was imagined and that's what I'm committed to progress absolutely real
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:31.080]  progress not the eugenicist the industrialization progress well people
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:35.520]  need to call Congress and starting to happen and say impeach Obama throwing
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:39.520]  out of office arrest him and go after Holder because they're starting to
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:43.680]  persecute the press sir as you know they've arrested Janesh DeSousa they're
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:47.160]  arresting governors for no reason they're threatening people I'm being
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.600]  threatened I don't want to give it any attention but folks need to pray for us
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.760]  you know what it's like when they start threatening you but that shows we're
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:59.200]  getting to them right where we are I would say you look we got 70% of the
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:05.160]  population the United States wants this bomb out now I think it's 77 yeah yeah
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.440]  that's what it's it but then you have people of members of Congress not a
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:16.920]  majority but I think you could probably get in a fair share about 20% of the
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:22.640]  members of the Congress I think would be willing right now to say throw the bomb
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.920]  out as a matter of fact some members of the Congress are almost hysterical get
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:32.280]  this nut out of there it is crazy I've never seen I've never seen power
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.720]  grabbing like it what do you know from your sources about Obama the man is he
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:41.640]  a total puppet and what's going on with him oh he is a he's a he would have
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.680]  been nothing except for a woman called Valerie Jarrett now Valerie Jarrett had
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:53.280]  been was an American by by law but she was really a British agent and she was
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:58.520]  assigned to go back into the United States and through some crook people
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:05.120]  Harvard and things like that this monkey or virtual monkey became a political
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:09.840]  figure he was nothing he would never become anything except for Valerie
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.160]  Jarrett he is he's not really a president in functional sense I mean he
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:19.360]  runs around with his jockstrap between the you know the two parts of the White
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:25.160]  House family part the other parts the public part and he was playing with
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.000]  basketballs up in this little room which separates these two parts of the White
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.560]  House and so he was not really much of a heavyweight his idea his mental
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.440]  capabilities and ideas are virtually zilch or less than zero in some respect
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:44.400]  I think it's probably better so he's only an instrument and what happened is
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.920]  the British the British system got him elected president by the biggest drug
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:55.280]  deal ever run and you remember that when he was running against Hillary Clinton
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:00.320]  and came down to Texas and they were running pretty much neck by neck and the
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:09.000]  drug flow from Texas the drug money through Texas for coming out of London
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.640]  was the thing that won him his presidency and Wall Street was fully behind
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:18.880]  it I know you've written books and everything about the British Empire
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:22.200]  running most the drugs and boys that's certainly certainly true their big

[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:11.280]  to listen to you I'll be very quick and and brief and bullet type points you
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.120]  know your analysis and that of your esteemed guest is spot-on absolutely
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:24.800]  correct secondly I'm not an I'm agnostic on this matter for the Ukraine and I
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:31.520]  have I'm not tied to one side or the other but after listening to state
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.640]  department official Newland saying that she had the US had spent five billion
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.760]  dollars and that going to a poor country that should have been able to buy
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:49.600]  thousands if not some million people so that shows I think why there is such a
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:55.920]  polarized kind of situation with only certain group of protesters and as you
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:57:03.400]  observed correctly that the police have been remarkably restrained which would
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:07.720]  not happen in you know other parts of the world and lastly may I offer this
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.080]  prediction and I'm not trying to be alarmist I believe that President Putin
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:19.120]  is just biding his time to wait for the Sochi Olympics to end and after that if
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:25.920]  this level of violence continues he's going to take matters in his hands just
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:30.160]  because that is I believe Russia's interest so that's another great point
[01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:34.000]  they notice they pulled this whole Soros thing off during the Olympics just like
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  they attacked at the last Olympics in China remember that in 2008 they launched
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.440]  an attack on Russia during the Olympics when they knew Putin was there this is
[01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.280]  this is unbelievable and you know that's a good point how do you think the
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:51.800]  Russians are going to respond though well I think it's be restrained and you
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:56.560]  know this of course will be fodder for I believe the West meaning they'll say oh
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:01.080]  yeah this guy is a real you know anti-democrat this that the other put
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:05.960]  to demonize put an even more I don't just like the Georgia case the West will
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:11.080]  not be able to do anything after all you know all the gas goes through through
[01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:14.320]  Ukraine and if it doesn't there's another pipeline around it and it's
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:18.040]  Ukraine who benefits more from the passage of gas getting the terrorists
[01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:23.080]  etc. and getting Russian gas too well said the Habu you're amazing you know
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:25.880]  what's sad you hear folks they're obviously not from the US and they all
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.360]  about geopolitics and everything works and you talk to my average America they
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.480]  don't even know what planet we're on I mean our listeners are smart and informed
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:36.320]  but I mean it's fun to know how the world works it's all the little pieces and
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.560]  it's all the little I love talking to people like Habu they're right back stay

[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:13.840]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.840 --> 02:00:22.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:32.480]  all right let's jam in as many calls as we can right now Judy I'm sorry I told
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:36.040]  you to hold over to finish your point and that guest went by appreciate you
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:40.920]  doing that what was your other point you were gonna make Judy okay well I was
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:46.040]  talking about men in the United States I really think they need to be handled
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:49.520]  just a little bit with kid gloves because I think they're afraid for
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:54.080]  themselves and their families and I just wanted to say regarding what Mr. LaRouche
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:57.680]  was saying I think one of the most important things for us to realize
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:02.800]  right now is that we're human beings but we're forgetting that I really think
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.160]  because of the entertainment the drugs what's being fed to us what we're
[02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.880]  drinking what's flying at us in the air all of these things accumulative but I
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:16.480]  do think men are fully aware of what's going to be happening to them and their
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.240]  families and I think they're greatly concerned but don't want to really do
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:23.520]  about it at this point but they're I think there are people listening to you
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.680]  alternative media and I think there is a push and the other thing I'd like to
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.560]  say because I think it's very significant is that I sent do a couple
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.520]  weeks ago this article about the there's a count of the cost of the
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:42.440]  constitutional convention there's 35 states that have signed up for it and
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:48.920]  there's 38 that are needed in order to have a convention where basically the
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.640]  people say okay Congress you're not going to be doing your job we have
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:56.200]  something to say about it and we're going to initiate change so I just wanted
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:04.200]  to bring that up because it's very real so I hear you I hear you very well said
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:08.080]  God bless you let's talk to Julio in Illinois Julio thanks for holding you're
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:12.800]  on the Ukraine go ahead you know Alex and I covered I covered the NATO trial
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:16.420]  NATO 3 trial and they were talking about Molotov cocktails at these three
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:20.620]  patties were supposed alleged to use and the Cook County State's attorneys would
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:24.880]  have salivated they would have loved to watch the footage coming out of Kiev
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:29.440]  Ukraine with these neo-nazi protesters I mean let's call it state of state these
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:32.240]  is what these are some of the protesters in Ukraine they would have
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:35.840]  salivated over that footage of them literally making Molotov cocktails and
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:40.120]  throwing them at the police well you hit the nail on the coffin just a few
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:45.040]  moments ago when you said unfortunately that here in the States we are pretty
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.000]  much ignorant to what's going on throughout the world geopolitically we
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:54.280]  are most of the country is unaware of anything really that's going on across
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:58.680]  the world now you also mentioned about the Brent basket of Europe Eastern
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:02.880]  Europe which is Ukraine not only is George Soros funding these protests but
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:08.160]  the multi-nationals like Monsanto who's also funding the protest in Thailand as
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:15.000]  well Thailand a big rice home of Asia Ukraine with the bread bread market it
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.480]  it's amazing also you have John McCain senator John McCain such a freedom lover
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.080]  he is our beloved senator about a month ago he was speaking at the Brookings
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:29.160]  Institute and as a journalist I get so frustrated seeing these events on
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:34.160]  C-SPAN wishing I was there John McCain a month ago literally called Alex for a
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:38.920]  technocracy in Ukraine now we all know how that's how a technocracy has worked
[02:03:38.920 --> 02:03:44.240]  in EU nations like Italy they're already going through anti-EU protests as we
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:48.400]  speak you're not going to see that on Western corporate media but John McCain
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:53.520]  literally calling for a technocracy in Ukraine while you're seeing on corporate
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:59.400]  media all these freedom fighters in Kiev they they want to be in the EU they
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:05.120]  want more Western influence you know I've forgotten he said that just a little
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:09.880]  while ago and for those that don't know when you hear a technocracy when they
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:14.960]  appoint the Italian president or the president of Spain or the another

[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:25.240]  the GCN radio network
[02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:39.480]  Joseph Farah the editor-in-chief over at worldnetdaily.com W&D.com he also found
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:42.840]  of the Western Journalism Center he's ran some of the biggest newspapers in the
[02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:47.880]  United States before doing that was the first really constitutionalist
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:54.040]  libertarian conservative proto tea party publication out there other than maybe
[02:08:54.040 --> 02:09:00.200]  you could say Newsmax that was main more line more mainline Republican and
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:04.560]  really a trailblazer he joins us just for the next 25 minutes or so because I
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:07.840]  wanted to get him on about the persecution of Dinesh D'Souza the
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:12.000]  persecution of governors over things that clearly I don't think are illegal
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.120]  you compared to what Obama is doing I mean it's it's it's clearly political
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:24.560]  persecution by this undoubtedly corrupt Justice Department headed up by Eric
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:30.040]  Holder but then we learned that Google told worldnetdaily that they're not
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:34.200]  gonna let them run their ads anymore because they have articles about quote
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.320]  black mobs it's happening here in Austin large groups of young black youth
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.440]  beating up white people it is racial attacks I mean it was a group of white
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:49.440]  people it'd be a white mob so we're seeing the censorship really intensify I
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:55.880]  remember Joseph Fara said right before the last election he said look I didn't
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:59.680]  endorse McCain or Obama last time I wrote the book none of the above I was
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.560]  wrong because Obama is so bad he's not a regular Democrat they're going for it
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:10.400]  all and quote we're gonna be in jail or they're gonna try to put us in jail we
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:12.880]  may have to leave the country he said all this on air someone to repeat it all in
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:17.040]  his words and I'm like man it's really that bad Joseph he's like yeah off air
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:21.600]  he goes I'm serious that's the word and now you got Matt Drudge tweeting that
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:25.960]  he's preparing an emergency exit plan basically and that you should too most of
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.840]  the big elites have already left the US people that have been part of this
[02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:33.880]  takeover have been leaving this is this is serious business you've got mainstream
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.360]  news now saying returning veterans of the main enemy and they've got mock
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:41.440]  cities to fight the Tea Party this is happening Joseph let's so let's talk
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.200]  about the political persecution all right but we indulge me before we get into
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:50.480]  that to just say one thing that I know you're too modest to allow me to say
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:56.640]  just but just give me two minutes that you guys that info wars that you Alex
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:01.680]  are really doing an extraordinary public service I have to tell you you know
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:07.040]  first of all W&D has been around for 17 years before Newsmax by the way but the
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.880]  and during most of those years we honestly we joke about it at W&D you
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:18.680]  know that we were sitting on stories for days sometimes weeks big story but we
[02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:23.360]  knew that nobody else who can do those stories so we be relaxed about it well
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:28.080]  you know in recent years we have noticed that we've gotten scooped by info wars
[02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:31.960]  so many times on stories that I think are really important it specifically I
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:36.600]  want to commend you for sticking on this you know the ammunition buys by the
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:41.320]  federal government I mean this is how you know this is how we find out about
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:47.640]  these things because info wars is on the case and recently the thing about the
[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:54.560]  driver's license registration database that they're starting info wars is
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.680]  kicking butt and I want to hand it to you and I feel like you know for the
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:03.960]  first time we've got it sharpens up at W&D because we can't sit around on our
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:07.920]  hands anymore taking for granted that we're going to have these stories
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.000]  exclusively and that's a good thing competition is a you know friendly
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.400]  healthy competition that's what you guys are providing and I think it's that
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.280]  made us the better for it so just just wanted to say put that out there now
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:27.280]  with regard to the topic at hand you're right I remember saying those words and
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:32.000]  you bring out the best of me Alex sometimes you know I need somebody to
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.520]  poke me a little bit on the air to say what I'm really thinking and you're
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:42.480]  good at that but yeah what we're seeing today with the you know persecution of
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:49.040]  Dinesh D'Souza and let's talk about Ben Carson and you know we can get into the
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:53.920]  Google thing but you know Dinesh D'Souza is a great example because here's a guy
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:13:00.080]  who you know was one of the highest profile Obama critics in during the 2012
[02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:04.400]  presidential election year makes it a film that you know second highest
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:09.920]  grossing documentary ever all about Obama and you know we turn around and
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:15.800]  in the early 2014 here this guy is getting indicted this guy is a scholar
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:23.760]  you know the termic gifted smart guy written the gazillion books and he made
[02:13:23.760 --> 02:13:32.520]  this movie and now let's just say for a moment he's 100% guilty of the campaign
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:38.080]  finance charges that he's used basically he's a hundred percent guilty you're the
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:42.520]  president of the United States you're the attorney general you do you go and
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:48.800]  indict this guy on this penny anti charge knowing what that looks like to
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:53.400]  the whole nation it looks like retribution it looks like payback and I
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:57.600]  gotta tell you you know if you want to get somebody who's involved in politics
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.840]  and who makes political donations the way the campaign finance laws are written
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:07.360]  in this country it's easy to do you can get anybody who's involved and every
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:12.160]  campaign breaks the law or skirts the law because nobody can read all the
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:17.160]  laws and then you've got this famously corrupt justice department with fast
[02:14:17.160 --> 02:14:23.720]  and furious Benghazi Salindra now fitting in judgment and in persecuting people I
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:27.880]  mean it's clearly persecution and it's very creepy that's right now but you
[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:32.400]  know a normal president a normal a normally corrupt president you know
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.920]  would look at that and say you know what back off on this this is gonna look
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:41.160]  bad to the it's gonna look like we're going after our political enemies they
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:45.800]  have no self you know they haven't they're not they they don't look at that at
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.040]  all they're they're they're just completely oblivious to that they don't
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.160]  care in fact I believe they're sending a message by indicting the nation is
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:00.600]  that the guys like you and me and drudge and you know the other new media folks
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:05.240]  out there who are getting to them and they want us to be looking over our
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.120]  shoulder all the time then Carson the guy gives a speech at the National Prayer
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:15.520]  Breakfast with Obama there he turns around a couple months later the IRS is
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:22.160]  giving him a you know a proctological exam and it's still going on and you
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.440]  know thank goodness he's the man of courage he's not back and down he's
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:30.080]  exposing it a lot of guys don't want to talk about those things when it's
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:34.440]  happening to them because they don't want to become pariahs and here's
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:40.280]  another thing about this Alex when the suit they got invited I personally went
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:45.840]  and called lots of people I know people whose names you would all everyone would
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:51.520]  recognize and I said how come you're not speaking out on this because you know
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:55.920]  this is a big deal what we're seeing happen right now and you know that a
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.880]  lot of these guys a lot of people who they're friends of mine I don't want to
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.800]  name them I don't want to embarrass them a lot of people were afraid to speak
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:11.000]  out you know I don't know the facts I don't know the details but come on details
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.240]  this is payback it's political pay me it's so obvious and a lot of them still
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:22.400]  have not spoken out and that's a test by the authoritarians can they start
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:27.480]  setting people up can they start going after folks and these people that do
[02:16:27.480 --> 02:16:31.440]  this that are cowards so no you spoke up drug spoke up I spoke up many others
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:37.480]  did many didn't it shows they have no instinct clearly he just gave a little
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.280]  extra money and his friends did to somebody who he went to college with and
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:47.760]  it was in a hard race against the Democrats and they lost it but it was
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:52.160]  out in the open and bundling is done by everybody it's kind of like Ken lay what
[02:16:52.160 --> 02:16:57.320]  he did wasn't illegal and that was later found to be I've looked at the law you
[02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.840]  know at best it's a crooked toenail that's why they're trying to get him on
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:03.080]  giving false statements to the FBI because he might have said something a
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:05.400]  little different one time a little different the next time that's why you
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:09.080]  can't talk to him because they always get you for claiming you said something
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:13.360]  wrong so the answer is I'm not talking to you and the fact that people wouldn't
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:18.840]  have the instinct to defend the press imagine if if Bush in his Justice
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:22.600]  Department we know Michael Moore that's my story on this and look at his
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:25.480]  donation records I know he gives big money the Democrats we ought to find
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:31.120]  somebody he's given more than $3,000 or whatever the max is and imagine if
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:36.640]  George W. Bush does a fair I want your take on this no I'm ranting imagine if
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:41.800]  George W. Bush two years after Fahrenheit 9-11 if he would have had Michael
[02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:45.040]  Moore indicted what would have happened I mean I would have come out against
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.320]  Bush well this is exactly the point I've been trying to make in fact I I tried to
[02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:52.720]  get in touch with more just to have him comment on what you think about this you
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.360]  know and I wanted to ask the question I never got to because he didn't want to
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:00.680]  have anything to do with it well you know let's let's just put the shoe on the
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:05.800]  other foot if this happened what would you have thought because I want to you
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:12.120]  know I want to get to the conscience if they have them of the liberals who you
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:15.520]  know if the shoe were on the other foot they would be looking at this and saying
[02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:20.480]  oh my gosh this is obvious payback this is obvious political retribution but
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:25.680]  they can't see it when it's so obvious with Dinesh D'Souza and Ben Carson on
[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:32.520]  and on we could go and we know the White House is using regulation in the IRS to
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:36.240]  harass their enemies the Democrats are now in the news saying hey we want the
[02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:41.000]  IRS to shut down our competition get in there and do more that was an amazing
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.800]  thing you know that you know how dumb I am I didn't figure that out until

[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:16.080]  final segment here with Joseph Farrah of world that daily I'm Alex Jones of
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:22.720]  info wars we just joined us looking at Obama and his presidency and the
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:30.640]  precedents it's setting what are the stakes in your view Martin E. Muller
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.600]  who's who said you know first they came for the communists and I didn't speak
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:39.400]  out because I was not a communist and he went down the list of all and you know
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:43.120]  when there was no you know they came for me but there was no one left to speak
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.000]  out for me that's kind of where I see us right now and I'm not you know look I
[02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.520]  know what everybody's gonna say as soon as you say that are you comparing the
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:55.840]  United States to Nazi Germany are you comparing Obama to Hitler no but if we
[02:24:55.840 --> 02:25:00.800]  can't learn the lessons of history you know and you know what that means and I
[02:25:00.800 --> 02:25:04.640]  think that that's where we are right now because you know we talked about the
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:10.080]  next to the bank Carson and others like that and I don't see people out in the
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:14.520]  streets angry about this and that's exactly what Neymar was talking about
[02:25:14.520 --> 02:25:20.600]  now where did we're where does this lead you know we we saw Obama took his hand
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:24.720]  long ago even when he was running for president and in his first term you know
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:29.760]  he talked about building a civilian national security force that was as
[02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:34.400]  powerful and as large as the fence department what did that mean now we
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.560]  see him you know dismissing hundreds of senior officers in all the branches of
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:46.400]  the military generals being purged and we you know we see all kinds of you know
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:51.320]  you guys are doing the stories what is all this ammunition for for domestic you
[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:55.340]  know domestic agencies within the United
[02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:59.680]  giant armored vehicles drones they say the main enemies the tea party hollow
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:03.000]  point bullets the whole nine yards right and then they say the hollow point
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.640]  they're for they say they're for target practice yes we use the hollow point for
[02:26:07.640 --> 02:26:12.560]  target practice right I mean it's crazy stuff where's it going I don't know where
[02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:17.240]  it's going Alex but I do know this that if the opposition is not united and
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:22.000]  strong against this that it will ruin this country will be the end of this
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  country as it has been known you know for 230 years if he keeps getting away
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.880]  with all these dictatorial power grabs that are historic do you think there's
[02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.640]  any danger he might actually try to pull something stay in or just put so much
[02:26:34.640 --> 02:26:39.160]  evil in place that he leaves and then all of his operatives just keep running
[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:44.000]  things I think a part of him actually is gonna be tired of being president I
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:48.320]  think the bigger danger is you know laying the groundwork for tyranny that
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:53.680]  cannot be easily undone when he's gone you know with maybe he's gonna hand pick
[02:26:53.680 --> 02:26:58.840]  a successor I don't know but whatever it is we can't let it happen I believe
[02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:05.800]  we've got to be in strong opposition to this guy that's the key exposing I mean
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:10.240]  you went when he's out there bragging about using executive orders to
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:15.240]  legislate I mean that ought to be assigned to everybody liberals and
[02:27:15.240 --> 02:27:20.120]  conservatives alike it ought to be saying what we have a constitution in this
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:24.400]  country that's not what executive orders are for and Joseph Farrell
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:29.880]  Daly just brought up the key final point with friends like Carl Rove and John
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:35.200]  Boehner who needs enemies that's really the issue is that these people are
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:40.840]  blocking any real resistance absolutely in fact I'm starting a super pack myself
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:48.640]  here to wage war in 2014 and 2016 and I think the key is you know using the
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:57.520]  tools that others have used you know in opposition to real competitive politics
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:01.760]  to dominate politics and use those tools to fight back and neutralize the Carl
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:07.880]  Rove to the world that's something we got to do the Republican leadership is
[02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:11.740]  really scared of the Tea Party that that shows me we have a chance of actually
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:15.840]  taking over it's you know sadly it's probably the only chance we have there
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.160]  isn't enough time now because we talked about off the air to do anything else we
[02:28:20.160 --> 02:28:24.480]  can't start a party from scratch and compete with these you know that there's
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.320]  so many advantages the two the two parties have structurally in this
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:34.320]  country it's you know but the only shot we have is taking over one or both of
[02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:38.440]  the parties and I you know I've always said take them both over but you know
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.520]  that the one we have the best shot at right now is the Republican Party we
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:48.120]  got to do it that's why we we named our super pack takeover I didn't even know
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:52.240]  that yeah well we'll be making some announcements about it shortly but as
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:29:00.400]  usual info wars Alex Jones gets the scoop from my own mouth Joseph Farrell

[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:39.760]  just gonna get on down to talking to you now go ahead all right that's how you
[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:45.240]  do on I'm doing all right that's a net that's a handle from one of my favorite
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:51.520]  Stanley Kubrick movies yeah yep it is I got a couple points here you talked
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:58.480]  about the the UK global strategic trends document 2007 to 2036 earlier and
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:04.320]  it's very telling in the program it's actually global strategic trends
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:10.680]  program 2007 to 2036 and if you look at the map contained within the document
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:17.240]  it has several things it has explosions over the Ukraine it's a symbol of
[02:36:17.240 --> 02:36:22.120]  explosion and there's several threat levels listed at the bottom one of them
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:27.000]  is a coastal threat the entire continent or the entire island of Japan is a
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:32.240]  coastal threat along with the just the west coast of America for shadowing
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:38.720]  Fukushima the Gulf of Mexico coastal threat foreshadowing that map we need to
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.640]  pull that up and put it back on screen for folks yeah foreshadowing maybe the
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.920]  Gulf incident Gulf Coast oil incident there and also there's a there's one on
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:51.920]  Atlantic and it's noticeable that the coastal threat in California ends in
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:56.240]  Canada and ends in Mexico Japan is surrounded maybe a foreshadowing
[02:36:56.240 --> 02:36:59.240]  Fukushima I don't know but there's something they want to do in the
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:05.480]  Atlantic it doesn't seem to be happening yet but you look at that but also in
[02:37:05.480 --> 02:37:11.440]  this document it says the overall the middle class will be treated particularly
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:19.400]  harshly by globalization and that they will react and that Islamic terrorism
[02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:26.240]  will pretty much do the job in about 2020 and then gonna react it's very
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:29.680]  interesting tell your readers to look at your listeners to look at this map
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:33.200]  yeah the easiest way to find it is type in revolution flash mobs brain ships
[02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:36.120]  that'll bring them to the Guardian and then where is the PDF in there I haven't

[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.400]  they're saying in the document that the middle class is gonna be mad and rise up
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.400]  and we have to put them down basically but they never mention why the middle
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:05.680]  class gonna rise up yep they're also advises using neutron bombs for

[02:39:56.760 --> 02:40:03.200]  you ever notice that wherever the stag hag and McCain wherever they go there's
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:07.720]  trouble that the flawless on well no they're like serious state department
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.280]  black op commanders they always have been they run around running these
[02:40:11.280 --> 02:40:15.760]  operations yeah yeah and they just continue to do and people just keep
[02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:19.400]  following them letting them do it and I see Washington DC I don't see them as
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:23.840]  Democrats or Republicans I see them as a two-headed snake we need to cut those
[02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:27.520]  heads off well yeah and then and then we've got white blood cells trying to go
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:32.080]  in to heal things with the tea party so it's all under attack by the entire
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:37.000]  double-headed monster if the tea party were to rise up now if they would do
[02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.400]  one thing and have a massive recall of everything the party's even perfect it's
[02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:46.360]  a diverse group of people it's that it's Constitution common sense knows about
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.240]  the globalist knows about the UN and the globalists do not want that they
[02:40:51.240 --> 02:40:56.080]  mean it's the period it is the only opposition right right but if we had a
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:01.240]  massive group of people rise up and recall all these idiots in DC tell them
[02:41:01.240 --> 02:41:06.480]  come back we don't want you there I hear you ma'am I really appreciate your
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:12.240]  call let's talk to Bob in Texas Bob you're on the air welcome pretty good
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:16.440]  thanks for calling go ahead you were talking about the Ukraine earlier they
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.400]  had a Fox News pundit I mean he was just going crazy that we're not over there
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:24.320]  just bombing in Ukraine I mean that's where the guy acted the thing is that
[02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:28.880]  most people out here I've been for years now I've been trying to wake people up
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:33.040]  to the facts around 9-11 I've been trying to wake people up to the facts of
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:36.680]  geoengineering things that are going on in the skies above us sometimes I think
[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:40.280]  I could set the whole damn atmosphere on fire Alex and people wouldn't even
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:43.400]  notice well that's because they're poisoned they're they're they're
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:47.600]  mesmerized I mean we're in a science fiction movie here brother right so I
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:51.040]  mean you try and talk to someone about Ukraine which is a very is a pretty
[02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:55.200]  complex situation going on in the comp in the Ukraine you can't get people to
[02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:59.880]  wake up to 9-11 to the lies that went on there and people look at you like
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:09.480]  you're crazy or something it is it is extremely extremely frustrating to be
[02:42:09.480 --> 02:42:12.600]  awake and see other people who aren't awake and they think you being informed
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:17.320]  is a bad thing I'm putting on a geoengineering seminar here in my
[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:21.280]  local town here I live in Orange Texas right on the border with Louisiana and
[02:42:21.280 --> 02:42:25.600]  we are being sprayed down here just almost constantly now every time I get a
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:28.960]  blue blue sky I know it's not gonna last and then by the afternoon I've got
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:33.040]  this silvery haze all over all over the place it's just it's disgusting and you
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:36.080]  try to point it out to people though that's airplanes you know and things
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:42.040]  like this people are just so dumbed down I just sometimes it is just extremely
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:45.480]  frustrating I know I've woken up a few people and I guess I've done well at
[02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:51.160]  doing that but it is just you know what what what's gonna take for the American
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:55.680]  people to wake up are they gonna have to be banging down our doors before they
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.520]  they already are they just doing incrementally so people aren't aware of
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:03.280]  it I hear you and God bless you brother let me just say this as best I can to
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:08.080]  people they wouldn't be afraid of us as opposition if they didn't have the
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:12.600]  different mathematical war games and breakdowns to know that it could end up
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:17.160]  causing a big problem if people ever figured out they had power it'd be over
[02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:20.120]  the average person doesn't get involved because they don't think they have any
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.520]  power they're very insecure even though you know executives and people I know
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:30.000]  that are very wealthy and are incredibly powerful are very insecure and very
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:36.120]  cloistered almost all of them people are not adventures people are just
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:43.320]  absolutely intimidated by the complexity in the world and I don't blame
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:49.480]  them but if we can continue to expose the globalist agenda remember just ten
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:53.760]  years ago most people didn't know that the Federal Reserve was private now
[02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:57.960]  everybody knows that and ten years ago people didn't believe there was a new
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:02.560]  world order being formed now they're like yeah it's terrible on so many issues
[02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:08.840]  people now know it's true they say though what are you gonna do about it how
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.720]  are you gonna change that so we've already gone a long way and as things get
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:16.800]  really really bad if we lay the groundwork like the globalist have done
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:21.520]  they lay it for evil we lay it for good if people discover why all this has
[02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:25.640]  happened to them if people discover why things have gotten worse and worse and
[02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:29.080]  worse and how the globalist are organizing things getting worse to
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.880]  consolidate power because they want us poor and easily controllable then in
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:39.040]  any it'll always backfire if we identify the enemy we are engaged in an
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:44.400]  information war you know during the Cold War we did a great job in getting
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:48.560]  America's message out after the Berlin Wall fell we said okay fine enough of
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:53.280]  that you know we've done it we're done and unfortunately we are paying a big
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:45:00.400]  price for it and our our private media cannot fill that gap that's enough the
[02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.000]  American message you do you think what Hollywood and the news puts out as an
[02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:07.360]  American message but they'll doll up tyranny with some American flags and a
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:13.120]  model you are losing the info or Hillary so they have George Soros and all
[02:45:13.120 --> 02:45:17.760]  these will suspects launching satellites that will beam stuff in to wherever they
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:22.680]  want and pushing for censorship here of speech they don't like you know they're
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:27.200]  the biggest supporters of free speech of course they're against yours though and
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:29.880]  and and they're they're they're trying to launch all these quote alternative
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:33.240]  sites they're all gonna fall on their faces
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:42.360]  look if the information on this show ends up getting out to people in a big
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:45.280]  way and it's starting to happen there's no way they're gonna get away with this
[02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:49.960]  stuff folks it's just that it's so horrible what we're saying I don't blame
[02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:55.960]  people not wanting to admit it a scientifically designed technocracy a
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:03.160]  dehumanizing grid a fourth of Georgia hospital is closed due to Obamacare
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.960]  payment cuts health law impact has only begun
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:21.000]  these are decking an elite is what they are so sick no one in Jimmy Kimmel's
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:24.800]  audience has been able to sign up for Obamacare when he asked them that's
[02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:27.880]  because no one is able to sign up for it's all a hoax the idiots think they've
[02:46:27.880 --> 02:46:34.040]  signed up for it's haven't gotten the word yet and we've got James O'Keefe has
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:39.360]  exposed the project Veritas another scheme to quote turn Texas blue through
[02:46:39.360 --> 02:46:43.240]  fraud I mean it's just it's just incredible and you're like well I thought
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:45.520]  the Republicans are bad too yeah but they're they're making their move with
[02:46:45.520 --> 02:46:49.760]  the Democrats they don't even want two parties they control they want one party
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:53.760]  so there's no way to get out of this stuff it's just a gang of crooks they
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.880]  don't need to produce things need to just take over and then they run
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:02.080]  everything you don't need to become Henry Ford to be a major industrialist
[02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:05.320]  you see to get into government and shut down your competition and give
