[02:57.920 --> 03:03.600]  Russia today Alex Jones US media doesn't speak for us Hillary says we're
[03:03.600 --> 03:07.000]  losing the info war that is the globalist that have hijacked this
[03:07.000 --> 03:11.360]  country so we're gonna be breaking that down as well you talk and sitters
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.840]  return to gold and silver coins obviously I want to continue the
[03:14.840 --> 03:18.760]  discussion from yesterday's news articles why the dollars rain is nearing
[03:18.760 --> 03:25.400]  an end Wall Street Journal and others reporting that also the sheening of
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.040]  America in less than a week troubled actor Charlie Sheen becomes country's
[03:29.040 --> 03:34.120]  top pop culture icon and they've done different analyses and breakdowns he's
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.520]  bigger than John Wayne bigger than Marilyn Monroe and it's because he's
[03:38.520 --> 03:42.520]  not being a hypocrite I don't endorse you know everything he's saying or doing
[03:42.520 --> 03:45.920]  but he is my friend and he's been going through a lot and the point is he's
[03:45.920 --> 03:48.760]  saying I'm gonna be a hundred percent real and I'm not gonna be a hypocrite
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.840]  and that's what people recognize and appreciate is the truthfulness and it's
[03:54.840 --> 03:58.960]  it's just getting bigger and bigger and crazier by the minute I talked a lot to
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.720]  Charlie yesterday talked to him this morning and I just hope this whole thing
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.480]  ends well because I care about him I care about his courage coming
[04:08.480 --> 04:13.080]  up for 9-11 truth I've known the calm focused intelligent Charlie Sheen
[04:13.080 --> 04:17.180]  people are calling him a poet a great comedian all of these words he's come
[04:17.180 --> 04:22.480]  out with in terms are becoming cultural icons now and a lot of it is rooted in
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.320]  jokes that I told him some of it I told him get on Twitter three weeks ago when
[04:27.320 --> 04:31.960]  I was out of this house boom broke the Guinness Book of World Record for the
[04:31.960 --> 04:35.280]  most Twitter's people signing up in one day it's approaching two million right
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.240]  now I made the joke about how people say we're warlock Vatican assassins folks
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.880]  he's not a ninja he's not a warlock Vatican assassin that's a joke and he
[04:44.880 --> 04:48.600]  said people don't get my satire they don't get my joke you know put a little
[04:48.600 --> 04:52.480]  bit of hieroglyph into your mind to understand what I'm saying but people
[04:52.480 --> 04:56.760]  don't get it well I'm gonna be doing a video later today where I may be do it
[04:56.760 --> 05:01.160]  on air I break down exactly what Charlie's saying this is Alex Jones with
[05:01.160 --> 05:05.160]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one
[05:05.160 --> 05:08.680]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[05:13.200 --> 05:16.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[05:16.760 --> 05:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[05:21.080 --> 05:25.480]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[05:25.480 --> 05:29.240]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.240 --> 05:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.280 --> 05:41.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.120 --> 05:43.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:43.840 --> 05:48.800]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my

[07:08.600 --> 07:12.880]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for

[08:33.560 --> 08:37.360]  completely hypocritical when the US basically has no immigration law and
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.760]  is wide open and going bankrupt also ATF let hundreds of US weapons fall into
[08:42.760 --> 08:47.800]  hands of suspected Mexican gun runners ATF was ordered this is one of their own

[10:21.000 --> 10:27.720]  play a four-minute clip of me joining him via video Skype powerful
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.960]  information that we covered dealing with Hillary Clinton saying they're losing
[10:32.960 --> 10:37.440]  the info war well America isn't losing the info war the people that have
[10:37.440 --> 10:40.880]  hijacked our nation are beginning to lose the info war and there she is
[10:40.880 --> 10:46.360]  before Congress begging for tens of billions more to propagandize foreigners
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.520]  and us here domestically and they admit their bullets are basically empty
[10:52.520 --> 10:58.040]  there are other clip is empty and people know that they're a bunch of liars so
[10:58.040 --> 11:02.360]  we're gonna play this clip and then we are going to come back and launch into
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.800]  all of the viral news and information on this live Friday edition here it is so
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.240]  time to amp up the message machine I guess and who better to talk to about
[11:11.240 --> 11:17.560]  this than radio host Alex Jones hey there Alex lots to talk about Secretary of
[11:17.560 --> 11:20.840]  Clinton obviously fighting for more funding for the State Department's
[11:20.840 --> 11:25.760]  media budget but she says we are in a quote information war she wants more
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.480]  money than most of the other international stations combined your
[11:29.480 --> 11:34.480]  take Alex on the sides the many sides I guess of this war well it's good to be
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.480]  here and obviously I have the website info wars.com so we're focused on this
[11:38.480 --> 11:43.520]  I want to be clear I'm an American patriot I believe in my constitutional
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.520]  Republic I get a tear in my eye when I go to a football game and hear the
[11:48.520 --> 11:52.960]  star-spangled banner when the State Department talks about losing the
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.040]  info war and getting media dominance again in the world they're talking about
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.720]  the select group of offshore globalist that in the last 50 years have used the
[12:02.720 --> 12:08.720]  United States as an engine of their own private corporate war against sovereign
[12:08.720 --> 12:12.080]  countries and taking over the planet this is all admitted and so what's
[12:12.080 --> 12:17.080]  happened is so-called US television and print media the Washington Post the New
[12:17.080 --> 12:22.840]  York Times have lied about WMD's that didn't exist have lied about terror
[12:22.840 --> 12:26.440]  threats the former head of Homeland Security Governor Ridge wrote a book
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.120]  last year admitting they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain and
[12:31.120 --> 12:36.000]  so the American people realize that our media doesn't speak for us and is being
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.920]  used basically to propagandize not just us but the world and so it's not just
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.960]  people in other countries that aren't buying into quote US media it's the
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.280]  American people and the globalists are out of bullets I mean just last year
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.960]  when they were demonizing Rand Paul in his Senate run Politico called me and
[12:53.960 --> 12:58.080]  they said well what do you see being able to stop Rand Paul well I said
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.360]  nothing I'm a big supporter of his constitutional ideas but I said if you
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.880]  endorsed him if the mainstream media endorsed him that would hurt him I said
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.120]  you guys are out of bullets no one buys into or supports what you're doing you
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.200]  have lost the war for the hearts and minds because people don't trust you
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.280]  anymore I want to reply really quick once again what Secretary of Clinton said
[13:21.280 --> 13:28.040]  she's very clear about who is winning this war take a listen Al Jazeera is
[13:28.040 --> 13:33.320]  winning the Chinese have opened up a global English language and multi
[13:33.320 --> 13:38.480]  language television network the Russians have opened up an English language
[13:38.480 --> 13:43.520]  network I've seen it in a few countries and it's quite instructive all right
[13:43.520 --> 13:47.480]  but let's be honest this is not to pat us on the back this is more to drum up
[13:47.480 --> 13:51.800]  support on why she says the State Department needs more now since she's
[13:51.800 --> 13:56.120]  watching Alex or we hope she is I'd like to hear your advice to Secretary of
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.960]  Clinton both on what the message should be and how to better get it out there
[14:00.960 --> 14:05.480]  well again the people that have hijacked the United States in the last five
[14:05.480 --> 14:10.520]  decades to be conservative do not speak for the people of America and America's
[14:10.520 --> 14:15.760]  become the demon of the world instead of being the apple of the world's eye
[14:15.760 --> 14:20.600]  because the world has realized that we now predominantly have become an
[14:20.600 --> 14:24.360]  engine of evil and you're right to say that all Hillary is doing is hitting the
[14:24.360 --> 14:27.960]  panic button and saying give us more funding I mean it came out years ago
[14:27.960 --> 14:32.320]  that tens of billions of dollars a year is spent domestically and
[14:32.320 --> 14:37.960]  internationally to implant globalist messages corporatist messages in movies
[14:37.960 --> 14:44.080]  and TV and news and in newspapers and radio and the jig is up they know people
[14:44.080 --> 14:47.640]  are aware of that so I would tell the State Department stop lying stop
[14:47.640 --> 14:51.720]  engaging in disinformation stop attacking freedom stop attacking other
[14:51.720 --> 14:56.720]  sovereign nations stop being propaganda stop being modern Joseph Goebbels
[14:56.720 --> 15:01.320]  Nazi propaganda ministers and people might start thinking you a thinking of
[15:01.320 --> 15:07.600]  you as trustworthy sources you guys use the public faith and abused it to the
[15:07.600 --> 15:11.960]  point of if you even tell the truth no one believes you I mean if the US
[15:11.960 --> 15:16.520]  government-controlled media tells the public the sky is blue they think it's
[15:16.520 --> 15:20.400]  red if they tell people something's up folks think it's down if it's black it's
[15:20.400 --> 15:27.000]  white no one believes this orwellian propaganda system anymore okay folks so
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.320]  there was just a snippet of the 15 minutes I did on Russia today last night
[15:32.320 --> 15:35.920]  transmitted all over the world and that doesn't mean that other foreign
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.640]  controlled media as completely trustworthy either we have to study it
[15:41.640 --> 15:46.920]  all and basically sort through it ourselves but how many times has this
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.200]  so-called government lied to us how many times has this so-called government
[15:52.200 --> 15:58.360]  controlled media been caught trying to divide and conquer the population okay
[15:58.360 --> 16:01.600]  let me get into some economic news then I'm gonna get into the TSA and then
[16:01.600 --> 16:04.760]  we're gonna open the phones up in fact the phones are open right now in this

[17:14.960 --> 17:18.400]  a sick joke watching him masquerade around like some time if you're a
[17:18.400 --> 17:24.560]  humanitarian continuing with the north african situation Gaddafi army shells
[17:24.560 --> 17:30.440]  Zawaya casualties with the rebels the Libyan army has staged a prolonged

[17:52.720 --> 17:59.600]  US Libyan policy zero legitimacy and this is an article at prisonplanted.com
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.560]  breaking down what a fraud it is and how they are trying to gear up to at least
[18:03.560 --> 18:09.320]  back the rebels militarily if not invade the country so that's just some of the
[18:09.320 --> 18:19.240]  news that we have on that front continuing with this information on the
[18:19.240 --> 18:23.560]  economic front I do want to hear from listeners about the big story we covered
[18:23.560 --> 18:29.720]  yesterday that a whole gaggle of big marquee mainstream media sources are now
[18:29.720 --> 18:35.040]  heralding that the death of the dollar is nigh the death of the dollar is the
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.000]  world reserve currency you'll still have dollars they'll just be based
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.480]  basically and controlled by the private central banking cartel via the IMF
[18:42.480 --> 18:51.440]  World Bank under SDR rubrics but it says why the dollars rain is near an end and
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.360]  it goes on to report the single most astonishing fact about foreign exchange
[18:56.360 --> 19:01.120]  is not high volume of transactions as incredible as the growth has been nor is
[19:01.120 --> 19:06.320]  it the voluntary of currency rates or the volatility of currency rates as
[19:06.320 --> 19:09.840]  wild as the markets are these days instead it's the extent to which the
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.960]  market remains dollar centric and they go through the fact that the world is
[19:14.960 --> 19:18.960]  moving away from the dollar that the end of the dollar is is a foregone
[19:18.960 --> 19:23.280]  conclusion and that that's natural and that that's basically a good thing this
[19:23.280 --> 19:29.320]  is tyranny designed from within our own government to basically bankrupt us as
[19:29.320 --> 19:33.640]  vassals of the globalist and we've laid this out for more than a decade what was
[19:33.640 --> 19:37.600]  coming and we're now approaching it and the media is acting like the end of the
[19:37.600 --> 19:44.120]  dollar hegemony is actually a good thing when it is going to be a economic
[19:44.120 --> 19:49.400]  Armageddon when it finally implodes so we'll talk more about that your phone

[24:55.160 --> 24:59.200]  you're on the air Scott thanks for holding hello Mr. Jones how are you I'm
[24:59.200 --> 25:04.640]  okay pretty tired but okay I'd like to say that we're in a depression our
[25:04.640 --> 25:11.040]  economy is as crumbling look Goldman Sachs Bear Stearns the Rothschilds and
[25:11.040 --> 25:15.280]  other greedy and evil international Jewish bankers on Wall Street have
[25:15.280 --> 25:19.840]  destroyed our economy Mr. Jones and not only have they destroyed our economy
[25:19.840 --> 25:24.760]  but the Federal Reserve Bank was founded by Paul Warburg which is a Jewish
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.080]  invention and that doesn't even include the wars that are raging in Iraq and
[25:29.080 --> 25:32.920]  Afghanistan which I blame on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.080]  we were attacked by the way on 9-11 because of the over 10 billion the US
[25:37.080 --> 25:42.480]  gives to Israel annually in military and economic aid okay Scott let me say
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.200]  something here okay because we don't screen your calls did we screen your
[25:47.200 --> 25:54.640]  call say that again did we screen your call no okay because the the the people
[25:54.640 --> 25:58.000]  that you know lie and claim I work for Israel or something that's their favorite
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.560]  thing to say all the calls are fake this is not a fake phone call right now you
[26:01.560 --> 26:05.040]  just called him or put on air but I just want to get that out of the way that
[26:05.040 --> 26:10.280]  these are real phone calls here on air sir I am against the corruption of the
[26:10.280 --> 26:13.240]  British government I'm against the corrupt things that the Israeli
[26:13.240 --> 26:16.440]  government does I'm against the corrupt things that the Chinese government
[26:16.440 --> 26:22.640]  does and I criticize Israel on a routine basis but to and I heard these calls a
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.920]  few days ago when I had a stomach bug and had to go off air and Watson was
[26:26.920 --> 26:32.200]  filling in and I heard people you know calling in saying this and I know it's
[26:32.200 --> 26:39.960]  wrong to go with the age-old idea that all evil on earth flows from Jews now
[26:39.960 --> 26:43.360]  are there corrupt you know evil bankers that are Jewish are there corrupt
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.120]  people pushing culture-destroying things that happen to be Jewish in Hollywood
[26:47.120 --> 26:54.320]  yes but to sit there and then say that that all the ills in the world are
[26:54.320 --> 27:00.920]  caused by Jews is wrong Jews are a very diverse wide group of people who have a
[27:00.920 --> 27:05.920]  lot of different political ideas and every time I talk about the Rothschild's
[27:05.920 --> 27:10.520]  Rockefellers people then say well the Rockefellers are Jewish too not true of
[27:10.520 --> 27:13.840]  the Rothschild certainly they are but when I talk about the Queen of England
[27:13.840 --> 27:17.360]  being corrupt and being ultra wealthy she suspended the Parliament two years
[27:17.360 --> 27:22.440]  ago twice in Canada she runs 20-plus Commonwealth when I talk about Queen
[27:22.440 --> 27:26.640]  Beatrix who's super high-powered and at the heart of the world government and
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.720]  and more wealthy than the Rockefellers people say quit covering up for Israel
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.440]  just because I cover all the big corrupt forces that are out there I mean are
[27:35.440 --> 27:43.360]  you saying sir that every evil in the New World Order is flowing out of Jews
[27:43.360 --> 27:48.480]  Mr. Jones and to prove it if you don't believe me have all your listeners pick
[27:48.480 --> 27:52.120]  up a book and read called the Protocols of the Learned Elder Design it is not a
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.880]  hoaxer it is not a forgery that the Jews maintain the gist of it is that the Jews
[27:56.880 --> 28:00.640]  are out for world domination and they have it now in the United States you
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.600]  know I never get what what forgery means I mean why do they always what people
[28:04.600 --> 28:10.880]  say forgery you mean it would be a fake or it would be a frame-up but but a
[28:10.880 --> 28:14.880]  forgery just means that you copy the signature or something I don't even get
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.280]  what that means let me explain it this is the protocols of the old learned
[28:19.280 --> 28:23.440]  elders of Zion the Jews have always claimed was was was forged by the
[28:23.440 --> 28:26.680]  czar of secret police yeah I thought it well I mean it's written like a comic
[28:26.680 --> 28:32.080]  book I mean why why would anybody write something down like that but it's real
[28:32.080 --> 28:36.640]  and Henry Ford who's my hero in the International Jew during the 1920s I'm
[28:36.640 --> 28:41.120]  sure you're familiar with mr. Ford he made the protocol famous and in the
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.160]  International Jew he pretty well much rehashes what the protocols said that
[28:46.160 --> 28:51.880]  the Jews control world finance the media now they control out the the US foreign
[28:51.880 --> 28:56.920]  policy they the Jews mr. Jones have inflicted tremendous harm upon the
[28:56.920 --> 29:00.360]  United let me ask you a question from your perspective should the Jews be
[29:00.360 --> 29:04.680]  gotten rid of yes they should in every kind I'm gonna stop you right there I'm
[29:04.680 --> 29:10.680]  gonna stop you right there I am Jewish now I'm not but I I would talk like that
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.600]  you want to kill the Jews you're gonna have to kill me okay and you know I've
[29:15.600 --> 29:19.320]  the big secret comes from me on air but nobody ever wants to say that because it
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.400]  makes it sweeter and more fun my wife's grandfather was Jewish now my wife's a
[29:24.400 --> 29:29.280]  Christian and my family are Christians but it doesn't matter if you say that
[29:29.280 --> 29:32.800]  because my wife has some Jewish ancestry that she's evil and needs to be
[29:32.800 --> 29:37.240]  killed then you're gonna have to go through me okay and if you say that the
[29:37.240 --> 29:40.360]  Hispanics were the devil have to be killed or black people are the devil a
[29:40.360 --> 29:43.560]  lot of people say that need to be killed or white people are the devil like some
[29:43.560 --> 29:47.480]  black groups say you got to go through me okay now you just said you want to

[32:17.800 --> 32:22.240]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[32:22.240 --> 32:27.000]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:30.800 --> 32:34.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[32:34.400 --> 32:38.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[32:38.760 --> 32:41.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[33:09.840 --> 33:12.720]  talking about then I want to make an announcement that we're going to Eric
[33:12.720 --> 33:19.920]  Martin David Moses Julio and others that are patiently holding it is the height
[33:19.920 --> 33:24.600]  of madness to believe that one group of people are responsible for all the
[33:24.600 --> 33:28.920]  evils in the world there was incredible enslavement and torture and murder
[33:28.920 --> 33:35.200]  going on in China 3,000 years ago thousands of years before any Jews or
[33:35.200 --> 33:40.120]  Jesuits or anybody else showed up in what's China today there was incredible
[33:40.120 --> 33:47.360]  murder and degradation going on with the Aztecs with the Babylonians with the
[33:47.360 --> 33:53.720]  Druids and Celts every culture basically gets corruption in place and people on
[33:53.720 --> 33:59.440]  power trips and the priest class and does the same type of stuff there's been
[33:59.440 --> 34:04.600]  money manipulation you know going on did Jesus whip the money changers in the
[34:04.600 --> 34:09.720]  temple for currency manipulation yes you know do you go back to the goldsmiths
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.880]  of Europe a lot of them being Jewish yes but when you sit there and say Jews are
[34:13.880 --> 34:19.680]  the source of all evil and then just broadly paint an entire group of people
[34:19.680 --> 34:24.600]  at a primitive level that is very alluring to just say there's the problem
[34:24.600 --> 34:28.920]  that's the problem that's everything and then you and then you call in and you
[34:28.920 --> 34:33.960]  say you know that I guess like in Germany if you had 1% Jewish blood you
[34:33.960 --> 34:38.960]  had to be killed and then and then I love how these Nazis always say Hitler
[34:38.960 --> 34:42.000]  didn't kill Jews it didn't target them when I've read Hitler's writings and
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.760]  listen to his radio broadcast where he talked about it and then you say kill
[34:46.760 --> 34:51.600]  them and Hitler didn't finish the job I mean I see this stuff everywhere and
[34:51.600 --> 34:56.600]  then you say oh but Hitler didn't kill people I mean you're saying kill all
[34:56.600 --> 35:03.000]  the Jews and you have chosen to say that my wife is Jewish and that when
[35:03.000 --> 35:08.200]  she's a Christian and and and and is proud of her I guess 25% or what would
[35:08.200 --> 35:11.320]  it be if it was a grandfather Jewish blood she's proud of her other you know
[35:11.320 --> 35:16.480]  Irish and Scottish and English blood just like I'm a little bit Native
[35:16.480 --> 35:19.360]  American if you don't like Native Americans should that mean they should
[35:19.360 --> 35:23.040]  all be killed or I should be killed so let's just get this straight if you hate
[35:23.040 --> 35:29.720]  black people I'm black okay I'm black okay I'm an African American all right
[35:29.720 --> 35:35.840]  if you don't like Hispanics I'm Hispanic okay I'm from Spain I'm not I'd be
[35:35.840 --> 35:39.840]  proud if I had any of that blood fine you don't like Portuguese I'm Portuguese
[35:39.840 --> 35:44.360]  you don't like Chinese I'm Chinese you don't like Koreans I'm Koreans you don't
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.080]  like Jews I'm Jewish okay I'm Jewish you understand that I'm Jewish okay good
[35:49.080 --> 35:54.560]  there you go all right I mean literally a guy calls in to my show and says all
[35:54.560 --> 35:58.240]  the Jews should be killed and these guys run around saying my wife is Jewish and
[35:58.240 --> 36:01.240]  all this baloney and that I work for Israel and all this mentally ill
[36:01.240 --> 36:05.480]  garbage when I'm critical of Israel and don't like Israel's globalist agenda and
[36:05.480 --> 36:11.800]  and had Kaiser on just a few days ago talking about how the Israeli lobby
[36:11.800 --> 36:16.960]  clearly lobbied to shut down the offshore accounts in Switzerland so they
[36:16.960 --> 36:20.880]  could move them to Israel or I make films about Israel and the US government
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.040]  together targeting the USS Liberty makes the Nazis even matter because they're
[36:25.040 --> 36:28.480]  all about being a cult all they do is fight with each other they're filled
[36:28.480 --> 36:34.120]  with feds and and all they do is say we're the best we're good we morally
[36:34.120 --> 36:40.280]  can just say everybody you know is is a devilish evil Jew and and and and we're
[36:40.280 --> 36:44.600]  good intellectually we don't make films we don't do quality radio programs we
[36:44.600 --> 36:47.960]  don't get anything done we just sit around saying we're the best we're the
[36:47.960 --> 36:52.360]  best we're the best and you've also got the black groups and I've had black
[36:52.360 --> 36:57.040]  people one time I was being interviewed by a media person they wanted to meet at
[36:57.040 --> 37:00.640]  McDonald's we were outside it's about six seven years ago when a black guy
[37:00.640 --> 37:05.200]  walks by and goes you're a blue-eyed devil and we're gonna get you and I see
[37:05.200 --> 37:09.840]  these videos that they put on the news of the quote black Israelites at least
[37:09.840 --> 37:12.960]  some of the more radical ones saying all whites of the devil kill their babies
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.120]  on and on and on okay well I'm white I mean that's really what I am my true
[37:18.120 --> 37:23.720]  identity is a Protestant Anglo-Saxon Christian my name's Jones I'm Welsh I'm
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.600]  German almost my entire mother's family on both sides are German and in British
[37:28.600 --> 37:33.400]  I'm proud of all that my culture is not bad but your your culture of your black
[37:33.400 --> 37:37.920]  is not bad but you know I I've gotten the calls from Jamaica in places
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.400]  particularly on air you know telling me that that I'm the devil because I'm
[37:43.400 --> 37:49.320]  European okay I mean it's it's crazy so wipe out all the Europeans and all our
[37:49.320 --> 37:52.720]  problems will be solved wipe out all the Jews all our problems will be solved
[37:52.720 --> 37:56.080]  wipe out all the Chinese all our problems are gonna be solved and every
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.920]  culture who's had wars with each other kind of has these historical legends
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.840]  about their enemy the Japanese hate the Chinese and have all these stories about
[38:06.840 --> 38:10.880]  how they're subhuman and the source of all evil the Chinese have the same
[38:10.880 --> 38:15.320]  stories about the Japanese the Arabs have the stories about the Jews the Jews
[38:15.320 --> 38:19.640]  have the stories about them I get on air and criticize the fact that there are
[38:19.640 --> 38:25.080]  race laws in Israel that they will arrest an Arab or someone else if they
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.640]  marry a Jewish woman I criticize that racism I get criticized by the ADL
[38:30.640 --> 38:36.360]  Southern poverty Law Center but I do it from a truthful loving real rational
[38:36.360 --> 38:40.480]  perspective okay just like I criticize the corruption of the Chinese
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.400]  government and the organ harvesting I'm not saying Chinese or Asians are bad
[38:44.400 --> 38:50.600]  and so it's very very frustrating for me to hear a phone call like that and
[38:50.600 --> 38:57.120]  someone really calls in and declares war and says you know if your wife has any
[38:57.120 --> 39:02.720]  Jewish blood that that she needs to die I mean think about the magnitude I mean
[39:02.720 --> 39:07.640]  you almost make people choose a side but I'm not going to do that you've you've
[39:07.640 --> 39:11.120]  you've you've made up your mind and you've made it that I'm this Israeli
[39:11.120 --> 39:16.640]  agent when it's completely the opposite of the facts or the crazy people that
[39:16.640 --> 39:20.400]  say I'm a Vatican you know warlock assassin that's why Charlie made that
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.320]  jokes we spent hours one time watching videos of people saying that about us
[39:24.320 --> 39:28.520]  if that's a joke you know now the warlock groups said they're gonna do a
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.480]  spell on Charlie Saturday it's in the Salem news it's fruitcake ism you know
[39:33.480 --> 39:38.200]  look I'm not a Vatican assassin I'm not a ninja I'm not a warlock it's a joke but
[39:38.200 --> 39:42.360]  see we we take those insults on and say okay if you're gonna say that about us
[39:42.360 --> 39:47.720]  fine believe whatever you want you understand that I am who I am I care
[39:47.720 --> 39:51.760]  about free market I care about private property rights I care about family I
[39:51.760 --> 39:58.080]  don't want Mexican children British children Jewish children Russian
[39:58.080 --> 40:04.320]  children Japanese children to be aborted African children okay it doesn't
[40:04.320 --> 40:08.600]  matter how many black groups and every time up in New York a lot of black
[40:08.600 --> 40:12.200]  folks come up shake my hand because they know who I am but a lot of people who I
[40:12.200 --> 40:16.080]  see her black you know they have got such many of my hatred of white people you
[40:16.080 --> 40:23.400]  can just see it and you can see the hate going on and so look it's the
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.880]  political system we need to change we need to get a bill of rights and
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.680]  constitution culture back in place so we all have liberty and freedom get rid
[40:31.680 --> 40:37.520]  of the Federal Reserve regardless of who runs it okay restore the Republic
[40:37.520 --> 40:43.040]  that's the system that protects us all I mean are they're corrupt I mean take
[40:43.040 --> 40:48.200]  George Soros there's a 60 minutes piece from him it's got to be 15 years ago to
[40:48.200 --> 40:51.960]  the midnight you can pull up George Soros on 60 minutes and he admits that he
[40:51.960 --> 41:01.080]  helped the Nazis go around in Europe and take the property from Jews which was
[41:01.080 --> 41:07.760]  then basically fenced out I mean this is a guy helping go after Jews and you say
[41:07.760 --> 41:12.480]  well look George Soros is a Jew look all the Jews are evil what I mean I mean
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.200]  that'd be like saying Jeffrey Dahmer was white I don't know what what what what
[41:18.200 --> 41:21.080]  his family crest would be what the background of Dahmer is his Dahmer
[41:21.080 --> 41:26.040]  German Google family crest Dahmer Dahmer Dahmer family I mean does that mean
[41:26.040 --> 41:32.560]  that everybody who's German or Dutch is is is it needs to be killed I mean it's
[41:32.560 --> 41:39.880]  just mindless idiotic tribalism so I am who I am I am a white Anglo-Saxon
[41:39.880 --> 41:45.280]  Protestant and that's what my family's been on both sides famously back to the
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.920]  Mayflower and right through to today and that's my identity and that's my
[41:49.920 --> 41:53.840]  family's identity and that's my wife's identity but if you want to say that's
[41:53.840 --> 41:58.960]  not our identity fine whatever you think it is white devil Jewish agent Vatican
[41:58.960 --> 42:05.240]  agent Masonic agent reptoid agent whatever it is you want to say about me
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.640]  fine I don't care that's your loss that's your loss for being petty minded
[42:12.640 --> 42:18.920]  and that's why you're so unsuccessful in life ladies and gentlemen and when you
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.680]  sit there and say wipe out all the Jews there's so many Zionist documents that
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.920]  are public where they admit oh this is great Jews will be persecuted and then
[42:27.920 --> 42:32.200]  basically the Jewish mafia can sit on top of them and suck off of them and get
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.000]  donations from them and use them for their own power how do you think the
[42:37.000 --> 42:40.480]  Italian mafia operated when the Italians couldn't get justice couldn't get law
[42:40.480 --> 42:43.000]  through the courts because they were being discriminated against or the Irish
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.200]  mafia that's how these mafias developed and so we have spoken out against the
[42:48.200 --> 42:52.200]  Jewish mafia that's what it is we've spoken out against the American
[42:52.200 --> 42:56.800]  Israeli Affairs Committee a pack we have done countless shows and I almost back
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.920]  off from doing it because as I've learned more over the years and as I have
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.800]  exposed Israel for corruption and bad things they're doing and being right
[43:06.800 --> 43:12.000]  there in the middle of it it actually makes the Nazis attack me more they
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.800]  don't want that they're not being real and they'll say well we're not Nazis we
[43:16.800 --> 43:20.400]  only want to kill the Jews whatever you want to call yourselves it's despicable
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.600]  and it's crazy and and it's wrong okay so I said I take a lot of calls but that
[43:25.600 --> 43:31.320]  one caller you know just absolutely had to be responded to because it's just
[43:31.320 --> 43:36.720]  nuts I mean it's totally and completely nuts that you can't just
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.520]  criticize corrupt individuals that are doing things you have to make it about
[43:41.520 --> 43:46.320]  entire groups of people and I for one am tired of it I'm tired of people making
[43:46.320 --> 43:51.440]  fun of folks that work cowboy hats and got a suntan and a red neck because
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.880]  they work outside all day and bust their hind in I'm tired of it but people like
[43:55.880 --> 44:00.080]  it people like to pick groups out and I'm so tired of TV always making fun of
[44:00.080 --> 44:04.640]  Southerners making fun of people in Texas making fun of people I'm just sick of
[44:04.640 --> 44:09.720]  it but it's what people like because it makes them feel good about themselves
[44:09.720 --> 44:13.280]  you know Alex Jones reaching tens of millions of people a month Alex Jones
[44:13.280 --> 44:16.120]  trailblazing the awakening against the globalist and there's all these
[44:16.120 --> 44:21.480]  armchair quarterbacks and people with you know podcasts with 15 listeners who
[44:21.480 --> 44:25.720]  can just sit back and go forget all his work everything I'm better than him
[44:25.720 --> 44:31.000]  because I can make up lies about him well good for you I know who I am I'm
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.800]  proud of who I am okay and quite frankly the lies and the attacks and the
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.120]  disinformation that helps me wake up every morning when I'm tired you know
[44:40.120 --> 44:44.440]  how stomach bugs work first one child gets it then your wife gets it and the
[44:44.440 --> 44:48.520]  other two children get it then you get it I was up a lot last night you know
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.120]  with children's sick and everything else I didn't want to come in today that
[44:52.120 --> 44:56.240]  bloodshot eyes but I came in here because I've got issues and things to talk
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.040]  about okay I've got important things to discuss you know I'm fighting the TSA the
[45:01.040 --> 45:06.240]  federal takeover we can do it successfully together we're fighting to
[45:06.240 --> 45:09.920]  not have the dollar devalued we're fighting to keep property rights in
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.080]  place in the second amendment and people just insert yeah but the Jews all need
[45:15.080 --> 45:20.640]  to be killed what what and and and you're so warped and you're thinking you
[45:20.640 --> 45:26.360]  think that's normal you think you call in and talk about mass murder and that
[45:26.360 --> 45:32.960]  you're some moral wonderful person there's a reason the Southern Poverty
[45:32.960 --> 45:36.240]  Law Center and ADL and others call me the number one enemy because I'm
[45:36.240 --> 45:42.000]  effective and I'm real and I'm cogent and I'm on point and I reach people with
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  common sense and logic and why is the TSA such a great issue to fight the
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.080]  globalist on well it's key for them to take over society in the 10th amendment
[45:50.080 --> 45:56.160]  it's their federal occupation rollout under FEMA and DHS but also it's
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.000]  something whether you're left or right conservative libertarian Muslim Christian
[46:01.000 --> 46:07.080]  Jewish atheist nobody likes it almost no one likes it and this big myth that we
[46:07.080 --> 46:11.160]  were gonna go along with it so they could break our will is falling and so
[46:11.160 --> 46:15.560]  we're coming together that's what the globalists don't want come together
[46:15.560 --> 46:22.000]  around ideas I don't care if you're white Hispanic Jewish doesn't matter to me
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.040]  it's what's in your mind and if you're running around waving Mexican flags and
[46:26.040 --> 46:29.480]  so upset by American flags you make you know the school teachers send kids home
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.720]  we're wearing American flags on their shirts an old Navy shirt that's crazy
[46:33.720 --> 46:37.760]  it's not that I dislike that the hordes of immigrants that are here because of
[46:37.760 --> 46:41.640]  their skin color I dislike them because I know most of them have been taught in
[46:41.640 --> 46:46.200]  Mexico that this country's bad and I know they vote over 90% to take my guns
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.400]  and take my private property they've made themselves the enemy because of what's
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.800]  in their mind I'm trying to reach out to those people I want us to win I want us
[46:55.800 --> 47:00.920]  to go to the stars I want us to be successful I don't dislike some black
[47:00.920 --> 47:05.560]  supremacist because he's black I just like him because he's saying he wants to
[47:05.560 --> 47:10.320]  kill me and my family and is making me his enemy when I don't want to be his
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.800]  enemy that's why I have black activists on this show that are actually doing
[47:14.800 --> 47:21.320]  something about the fact that 52% I was wrong saying 51 52% of blacks are
[47:21.320 --> 47:25.920]  never born in this country where's your black leaders on that really listen to
[47:25.920 --> 47:31.720]  what we say really listen to what we do search your soul search your discernment
[47:31.720 --> 47:34.480]  hey here's the big announcement I'm gonna come back go to calls mark dice will
[47:34.480 --> 47:40.040]  be on a date after but I got to go to some of your calls here's the deal

[54:14.000 --> 54:20.120]  thanks for holding hey what's up worldwide broadcast welcome yeah appreciate
[54:20.120 --> 54:24.080]  all the things that you're doing for everybody I've been following you
[54:24.080 --> 54:27.400]  every day listening everything I just got a couple things about that last call
[54:27.400 --> 54:31.640]  he sounds like a Hitler already like in the making but I just think the same way
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.080]  but you gotta notice there's schizophrenic thinking Hitler didn't kill
[54:35.080 --> 54:38.440]  anybody but we need to kill everybody yeah but he's not already thinking the
[54:38.440 --> 54:41.440]  same path but he's not gonna pull out they really actually do it but that's
[54:41.440 --> 54:45.920]  still halfway there but no no a lot of these people would start killing whole
[54:45.920 --> 54:49.840]  groups of people if they could and that's why we got the second amendment yeah
[54:49.840 --> 54:53.200]  but if you and yeah that's why I'm gonna go buy my gun I'm gonna get legit and
[54:53.200 --> 54:56.440]  get legalized and pass the password I think it's all Hollywood and the elites
[54:56.440 --> 54:59.760]  were doing it in Hollywood in Tupac and Michael Jackson all them talked about it
[54:59.760 --> 55:03.680]  and expressed in the song and OBB and they all got murdered or they got killed
[55:03.680 --> 55:07.560]  like like a secret way and thinking about Charlie she now think about I make
[55:07.560 --> 55:11.080]  music myself so when you express the music about New World Order and all those
[55:11.080 --> 55:15.080]  things that's going down in the public in the government on songs express yourself
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.320]  so when you get interviewed in the public you're invented so you don't
[55:18.320 --> 55:21.640]  really blowing up like that but Charlie seen when he does scripts and movies he
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.000]  can't express himself he has to play a role and read it line-for-line if they
[55:25.000 --> 55:29.640]  will he has a lot of power and by by totally blowing everybody away right
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.320]  now and that's why yeah I think he is in danger I appreciate your call let's
[55:34.320 --> 55:40.200]  talk to Mark in Oregon mark here on the air good morning Alex hey buddy Alex I'd
[55:40.200 --> 55:45.640]  like to speak very briefly on God's current and increasing wrath and heart
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.280]  break over the effect of the abominable sins which have taken God is dropping his
[55:50.280 --> 55:55.160]  hammer on America there's no doubt they've taken place in America and then
[55:55.160 --> 56:00.160]  they've been exported to the whole world as well as his heartbreak caused by the
[56:00.160 --> 56:05.400]  fact that his true people who are called by his name have not relied on his power
[56:05.400 --> 56:11.200]  and guidance to stand up and defeat evil from God's point of view repentance and
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.320]  to him with a sincere heart for our personal and national sins in public
[56:16.320 --> 56:21.240]  all across this land is all that is left to humanity in America and the whole
[56:21.240 --> 56:26.280]  world to bring Almighty God's power back into our land in our world by what he
[56:26.280 --> 56:31.600]  through his true children will initiate effectors spiritual warfare to defeat the
[56:31.600 --> 56:35.960]  evil forces mark I appreciate your call but the globalists have taken over the
[56:35.960 --> 56:39.840]  churches to believe it's the end of the world don't fight evil so they're just
[56:39.840 --> 56:43.040]  sitting there in their churches that are now most of them FEMA directed and
[56:43.040 --> 56:46.560]  controlled a moving quick here thank you mark David in Arizona you're on the

[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:19.600]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:31.880]  Alex Jones
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:35.720]  a lot of key news on the economic front as they announced the beginning of the
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.600]  death of the dollar and what that's going to mean right now let's go to
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:49.520]  Moses in California you're on the air Moses well thanks for coming out what's
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:57.080]  on your mind today what's on my mind is I went to a local fast food place here
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:04.880]  and they had a kiosk that you can order from like a computer and I thought that
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.440]  was yeah they're phasing they're phasing humans out of the checkout
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.680]  counters everywhere and it's a mode of control it's not a way to lower cost
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.920]  yeah and it just supports China because the darn things made there and well you
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.160]  know McDonald's going back years ago now you'll talk to an operator in India to
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:30.440]  order your food and then basically you got a few people in there with the
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:37.920]  robotic machines they're putting the microwaved fake food together yes that's
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.760]  right and I'm on another point I wanted to talk about I'm not sure if you're
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:52.600]  aware of IP version six but I believe that's the way of introducing internet
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:57.920]  to well they're they're changing the infrastructure of the internet to force
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.480]  you to only use their systems that have built-in control hubs in them briefly
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.560]  explain it to people IP version six basically makes the internet twice as
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:15.200]  big as the current infrastructure and makes it so that your local link IP is
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.240]  is basically known to the whole internet rather than having it through a
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.400]  firewall or something on the internet ID and then that's mainly so they can
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.600]  start taxing it and tracking you and framing people with internet surfing
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.440]  habits and they use things like WikiLeaks to put it out and claim the
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.920]  government didn't do it great points Moses who Leo in Illinois you're on the

[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.600]  details about that and the other Orwellian aspects of Facebook but you
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.520]  know I've been making the comparisons everybody this audience has been
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.160]  drawing comparisons seeing the comparisons between what we are
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:29.120]  experiencing in our world and Orwell's book so I've compiled about 300 pages of
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.200]  them and it's it's very very scary what's going to be coming around the
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:38.120]  corner here just in a few months in a few years and we have everything we've
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:43.720]  been talking about now and and cited in in trade journals or maybe just things
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:48.160]  that are are being implemented or working on patents that patent
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.200]  applications all of this stuff is coming to a fruition to the Orwellian
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.680]  nightmare if we don't all come together and wake up and stand up and come
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.320]  together and educate ourselves our communities get over the fear we're
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:06.640]  gonna live in the Orwellian nightmare where that's right we should be afraid
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.160]  of doing nothing go back to 1997 when I got arrested protesting the thumb
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:15.040]  scanners and I predicted they're gonna be in grocery stores they're gonna be at
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.640]  the the the gym they're gonna be to get your school lunch because I've read the
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.960]  government documents now it's becoming ubiquitous it's everywhere the face
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.920]  scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras the control grid is
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.320]  going into place right now but just like we're starting to defeat the TSA and
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:36.240]  just as even the mainstream media is decrying what they're doing if we make
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:40.480]  these other Orwellian issues important as well we can start turning the tide
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.240]  against it we don't have a choice and hence your manifesto big brother the
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.240]  Orwellian nightmare come true mark I salute you on this book this that your
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.200]  other three books are excellent this blows them away
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.760]  conspiracy theory there's no conspiracy theories in the book I'm sorry if I'm just
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.360]  talking about patents and and trade journals where they're saying that
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.480]  they're already testing cameras in Holland and they're they're ready to
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:07.280]  implement them in London for the Olympics in 2012 where they listen to the
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.400]  streets and if you yell at someone or if they the cameras detect that your voice
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.840]  is angry but then the pitch the volume that can't that's already been put in
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.120]  England yeah they're already testing this is already coming out so we don't
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.960]  have much time before we're living in your Orwellian nightmare and it's
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.960]  very good the social structure the control of information the perpetual
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.000]  state of war the personification of the party the telescreens the snitch
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.200]  culture the degraded and corrupted social related there's a global revolution
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:40.800]  against every canon of freedom telescreens going in 9,000 locations
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.120]  saying spy on your neighbors Forbes comes out today and admits Docs reveal
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:50.360]  TSA plan to body scan a pedestrians train passengers they're already doing it
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.840]  it's all happening listen there's a case in India of a woman that was convicted
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:01.040]  of murder because a machine read her mind and said that she had experiential
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:05.440]  knowledge of the murder scene so there's technology coming out that is already
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.040]  out I guess they're just unrolling newer and more advanced versions that
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.280]  supposedly reads your mind and can allegedly determine whether you have
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:19.200]  seen or heard something so these machines have already convicted people
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.480]  of murder in foreign countries and it's coming here the Orwellian nightmare is
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.080]  gonna come true if we do not all stand up wake up come together stop being
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:35.640]  afraid expose the false flag terrorism and come together and restore the Republic well
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.080]  mark let's walk through your book in the different chapters and why this is such
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:46.960]  an important tome well let's start off with Facebook a different day there's
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.800]  all section in the book about Facebook and again much of this audience may be
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:54.640]  familiar with this so this is for the masses this is for the people that aren't
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.480]  aware of these issues or maybe the people that are just starting to care
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.160]  about what's going on and so we're announcing Facebook Defrende just time
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.360]  to step back and think about the social implications of Facebook people there
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.000]  are police that are going on Facebook pages and arresting students for
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.960]  underage drinking using the photos that they posted as the evidence so just
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.400]  imagine the police are going on Facebook pages finding photos of students and
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:25.160]  then tracking them down and arresting them for underage drinking this is big
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.760]  brother this is what we're trying to fight so Facebook Defrende there's an
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.000]  article on infowars.com that kind of details some of the Orwellian aspects
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.960]  of Facebook not to mention just the the social implications of the narcissism
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:43.440]  and the self-absorption that these websites the supposed social networking
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:48.200]  sites have created but let's take another look at some of the some of the
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:53.360]  creepy aspects that Facebook has before we do that let me just add it's like
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.240]  Google you think you're going to the Oracle to get information but it's
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.560]  actually tracking what you're thinking what you're doing where you're going to
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.360]  eat what movies you're watching it's building a detailed psychological
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.720]  breakdown on you the same things happening with Facebook and you've got
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.440]  the founder of it calling his users idiots saying that they trust him that
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.320]  they're morons yeah and there's new facial recognition software that's out
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.480]  that's gonna identify everybody in every photo that's posted on Facebook on the
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.720]  internet there were apps that were created I think they've been pulled from
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:27.520]  the app stores now from Android and iPhone there's there's apps that are
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.200]  created where you can take a photo of some random stranger and using facial
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.320]  recognition software it will search Facebook MySpace the internet and find
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.560]  that person that's creepy that's the Orwellian nightmare that's what we're
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.040]  going to have to start learning about what are these social implications here
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.360]  and and what are we going to do we're going to live in a kind of world like
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.920]  this and the way that they're rolling it out is through the fear of false flag
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.880]  terrorism through dumbing us down eroding the culture the painting foreign
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.800]  countries as enemies everybody in Iran must be an enemy it's there's so many
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.680]  parallels between 1984 and and our world here just just listen to what Orwell
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.120]  wrote in 1949 he says quote with all their cleverness they had never mastered
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:17.880]  the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking well Orwell was
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.880]  right on a lot of stuff but he didn't he didn't think about them mind-reading
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.760]  machines now that most dangerous time was when you were asleep when you might
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.520]  you know give yourself up in a word you know yeah he talks about listen to this
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:35.960]  I mean the consciousness of being at war and therefore in danger makes the
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:41.120]  handing over of all power to a small cast seem natural unavoidable condition
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.600]  of survival I mean this is this is prophetic nearly I mean here we have
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.000]  just only go through another couple shocking quotes that have pulled out of
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.880]  this book and they fit right in with with what's going on in our society
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.840]  today we have quote in the past no government had the power to keep its
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:02.200]  citizens under constant surveillance the invention of print however made it
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.440]  easier to manipulate public opinion and the film and radio carried the process
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:12.520]  further we have become a culture of corrupt morons but there's a glimmer of
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.800]  hope Alex I see the V for victory campaign I see everybody getting out
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:21.440]  there and educating people about these issues poster campaigns educational
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:26.560]  outreaches and so I see the glimmer of hope here and if we can just continue
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.680]  to educate people get the word out we can come together well resistance you're
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.520]  saying it if we stand up if we speak out if we rebuke all this tyranny it will
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.040]  fail but if we decide it's a foregone conclusion that we're gonna go into this
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.320]  tyranny we're going to lose resistance is victory
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:50.800]  manufactured sense it seems to be an organic orwellian implementation of
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:55.480]  this technology but it's been pulled and brought it behind the scenes from from
[01:17:55.480 --> 01:18:01.480]  the Rockefeller Foundation who actually recruited the head of the head of the
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:07.040]  identics the number one facial recognition software company they was
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.800]  recruited in 1991 this guy Joseph Attic by the Rockefeller University and he
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.920]  was funded by DARPA to create the facial recognition systems and we've been
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.040]  talking about these they're coming they're coming they're coming facial
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:24.600]  recognition systems have actually been tested ten years ago in the Super Bowl
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.040]  and this is going to be used to buy and sell it's going to be your new ID the
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.240]  government the social engineers admit this and then if you're not a good
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.600]  globalist it doesn't matter what you have to pay for your food with or your
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.240]  house you're just shut down and that's what Homeland Security has said you're
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.280]  going to have to have TSA approval to own a gun to have a job this is total
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:51.240]  control it's total control and let's look at the snitch culture everybody's
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.280]  being turned into a paranoid person that there's terrorists around every corner
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.600]  they if you see something say something campaign from Wal-Mart it's
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:07.600]  becoming so unbelievably absurd that it's time to to start standing up to
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.520]  speak truth to power and and if it's so hard sometimes to articulate some of
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.320]  these issues to people when you're new to this or when you're trying to

[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:16.920]  they're railed against the crowd shifting gears but continue to look at
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:24.360]  propaganda Fox News a whole bunch of other publications are asking the
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.880]  question is Charlie Sheen's world-setting Twitter presence an
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.160]  elaborate stunt and they're asking all over the news did he stage all this
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.640]  wild stuff he sang on air is this all fake and and people are asking me this
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.480]  because it all started on my show last Thursday and the answers no the Charlie
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:46.880]  Sheen I know what never you never did drugs or alcohol in front of me was
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:51.760]  focused was really into politics then he went on a seven-month party kind of
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:57.680]  relapsed then he's now completely off everything and is wild you know the
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.960]  media says having a manic episode is pretty normal when you kick hard alcohol
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.280]  and drugs overnight but he's saying I'm alive and I'm not going to pull punches
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.280]  and I don't care what you think of me and so he's a deliberately just being
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.880]  super bold in people's face because they canceled the rest of a season of two
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:19.640]  and a half men that's why he's mad okay so for the media out there it's real
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:23.720]  okay it's real and people last week said well why did that happen on your show
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.480]  well I was getting him on to talk about the fact that I've seen him you know
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:31.160]  when the nurse comes in urine testing he is clean I was with him a few weeks
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:35.040]  ago and then it turned into what you saw and I didn't know what to think of it
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:41.120]  but now Fox News and others report that the sheening of America in less than a
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:48.000]  week troubled actor Charlie Sheen becomes country's top pop culture icon and now
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.360]  you know what are we gonna see from Charlie in the future well I hope he
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:55.960]  stays clean I think you're gonna see more from him on politics right now he's
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.560]  not doing that but certainly it brought tens of millions of new people to
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.320]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com I got to go on the view and talk about
[01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:08.280]  building seven being controlled demolition the banker dictatorship the
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:13.520]  TSA the Federal Reserve I've been able to do that on many other channels and so
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:18.400]  overall I just hope he makes it out of all this because he the whole fight with
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.120]  CBS all of it is very very real. Mark Dice I haven't asked your view on this
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.680]  I'm gonna ask it live on air what do you think? It's very interesting and of
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.040]  course the conspiracy theories are going around that this was a planned stunt but
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.040]  you can't plan something like that I mean and there's no way and even if this
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.520]  was some sort of a planned stunt between you and Charlie I mean Charlie would be
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.920]  during his interviews would be talking about some new world order issues I
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.600]  mean this I think it just kind of blew up into some mess you know it's I guess
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.880]  Charlie Sheen can't go on the air and talk you know talk negatively about his
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:55.600]  bosses without being accused of being crazy. It's fascinating too when the show
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.200]  is basically about about the real Charlie Sheen and I've seen the show a few
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:04.560]  times and he's a womanizer he jokes about paying prostitutes in the show so
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:09.040]  I mean the character Charlie in the show is you know kind of scumbag and so I
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:13.760]  don't know what their real big problem is well my my point is this the Charlie
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.320]  I've known for six and a half years was with his you know when he's been married
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:22.400]  is totally faithful is really into that certainly I think almost the image of the
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.280]  show was the old Charlie Sheen from a decade ago now he's kind of gone back
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.680]  to that gotten clean again and it's this supercharged Charlie Sheen and I don't
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:34.040]  endorse the lifestyle everything he's doing but the point is he's not like
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.000]  Republican leaders at Bohemian Grove bringing in gay porn stars the
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.200]  conservative media wants to ignore that while they moralize on Charlie Sheen I
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:46.080]  think what people are liking about what he's doing and the poll show it's very
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:50.240]  popular is because they like someone being honest and I think it really shocks
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.720]  people well it's fascinating I mean being on the other side of the media you
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.440]  know just how things can get distorted and people in the media have no idea
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:01.400]  what he's talking about they take jokes and quote them as being serious and it's
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.960]  it's very very fascinating and and I'm glad that Charlie Sheen was on board for
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.960]  9-Eleven Truth it's it's a great great publicity you know to have it yeah
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:13.880]  people say that it then discredits 9-Eleven Truth that's not how the
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.680]  media works people then start thinking about 9-Eleven Truth and looking at
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.320]  evidence and Charlie Sheen then has nothing to do with it yep people are so
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.080]  crazy that they think that you and him concocted the 9-Eleven Truth expose back
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:30.360]  in 2006 to discredit because you work for the Pope and that there was you were
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.240]  supposedly with me Alex when I when I bumped into Danny Bonaducci and you
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.040]  were the you were the cameraman according to yeah and Charlie Charlie was
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:43.200]  was running all that and that's that's then the Vatican assassin he's like well
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.680]  duh we work for the Pope we kill people you know I mean and then now that adds to
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:53.160]  which we love great people want to say all that great okay fine I'm a Vatican

[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.560]  today I told Charlie three weeks ago I said you got to get a Twitter account
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.000]  you'll get millions of users then you can communicate directly with people and
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.440]  hopefully down the road he'll use it for political purposes but I don't tell him
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:53.400]  what to do undoubtedly there's some other plans on the road I'll just leave it
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.600]  at that but we are invading Twitter today you know I've had a Twitter account I
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:03.000]  don't know for eight months or so I don't know less than a year I never

[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.520]  announcement but let me go ahead and read this article by Paul Joseph Watson
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.920]  that just went out at prisonplanet.com about 15 minutes ago it's also going up
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:57.240]  on info wars.com Alex Jones invades Twitter Hillary Clinton this week
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.200]  admitted the US military industrial complex and the globalist are losing
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:03.840]  the information ward alternative media outlets to cover real news and that's
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:07.960]  her quote Alex Jones is taking the info war to a whole new level by invading
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.680]  Twitter with a fresh culture jamming offensive and the power is up to you
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:15.040]  folks designed to bring truth to millions more people around the world
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:18.920]  Twitter has gone for being a playful social network tool to becoming the
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.360]  vanguard for political movements worldwide and a thorn in the side of
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.000]  globalist who have desperately sought to hijack the medium by activating armies
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.640]  of fake cent com social profiles to spam propaganda over Twitter and other
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:37.000]  systems not just in America but around the Farsi and Arabic world despite
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.480]  dominating the likes of YouTube while approaching a hundred million views on
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.080]  one of our YouTube channels alone as well as Facebook MySpace and Alexa not
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:48.720]  to mention Google Trends which have been successfully topped on dozens of
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:53.120]  separate occasions it's over 70 now the info war has yet to take Twitter by
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:58.320]  storm and we urgently need to redress the balance with the aid of our fantastic
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:02.680]  supporters and fellow info warriors to understand how quickly a new meme can
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.200]  invade and take over Twitter just look at the reaction Charlie Sheen was able
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:12.120]  to generate when he signed up to use the networking tool after less than a week
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:16.760]  Sheen already has 1.5 million followers and has attracted 1 million of them in
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.240]  just one day it's over that now Contrater reports it was not solely seeing in
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.360]  host Pierce Morgan that convinced Sheen to sign up on Twitter this past weekend
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:29.440]  during a visit to Sheen's home more than three weeks ago Alex Jones convinced
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:33.440]  the actor to start his own Twitter account but Jones is guilty of not
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.680]  following his own advice info wars as a Twitter account at twitter.com forward
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.800]  slash real Alex Jones but we've hardly even promoted it let alone used it in
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:46.720]  the info war to start viral hashtags or indeed invade those memes already
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:51.760]  circulating with the message of truth and then it goes on to say we're launching
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:55.640]  this agenda this info salvo by next Friday we want a hundred thousand
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.000]  Twitter followers please fellow info warriors help us do this we're gonna be

[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.200]  before let's do two today Alex Jones Twitter but secondarily let's make this
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:19.360]  number two or number one it's up to you your choice that today is D friend day on
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.040]  Facebook explain why this is important and from that headline mark well should
[01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:31.120]  we say today is D friend day cuz or or D friend day just search that because
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:36.200]  shorter is better let's just do D friend day Facebook how's that sound or what
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.760]  what terms from your article do we want to choose right now and get a viral
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.400]  attack on the globalist mark probably today is D friend day or just a D friend
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:48.200]  day and I talked a little bit about it in the beginning of our interview but
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.400]  let's listen to this remember when Elliot Spencer's hooker scandal broke and
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:57.520]  the governor of New York and we saw photos of his young high-class hooker
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:02.800]  all over the news and all of her family photos of her family too and you got to
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.960]  sit back and think wait where did these photos come those photos came from her
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.680]  Facebook page this girl had a Facebook or my split my space page rather and you
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:16.600]  enter into a a licensing agreement with Facebook with my space and you're
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.840]  licensing your photos to them and you're granting them sub-license to the
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:25.320]  bowl agreements and you don't how you're not getting any royalties you have no
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:31.120]  rights so that her lawyer Elliot Spitzer hooker's lawyer tried to sue my
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.000]  space for copyright infringement so that she owned the copyright to those
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.280]  photos but read the terms of service people you don't own those photos
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:44.080]  anymore you sub-license them out to Facebook to Fox News to News Corp to
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:49.160]  that's why you've got a sub link photos that you don't want them to steal to
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.240]  another site where you can reserve your rights that's why it's important to do
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.120]  it that way and this is just something to think about I mean you know maybe
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.160]  you're not gonna get wrapped up in an international scandal but how do you
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:04.280]  think this this girl's you know family well look at all the robberies where
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.240]  people are using people's Facebook to rob them because these idiots tell people
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.160]  when they're gonna be gone what time they go to work where they're going
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.240]  photos of inside their house you know the Facebook terms of service keep
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.000]  changing to just the two days ago I saw another article there's just whoops I
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.080]  guess Facebook users didn't get the memo in terms of service change and
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:26.200]  they're using and selling and giving away your cell phone information everything
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:30.040]  might as well go post your social security number on your Facebook page
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.760]  people so what we're doing today part of operation blindfold big brother as is
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:41.560]  just post the today is D friend a status article your status update or my
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.360]  video and let's get this viral let's introduce that's a great way to introduce
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:50.440]  people to the dangers of Facebook to the big brother or William aspects of it to
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:55.640]  get people to really start questioning yeah snap back I think the best search
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:02.120]  term is just D friend a D E F R I E N D day two words into Google over and over
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:06.360]  again let's hit them let's hit them hard folks you've got so much power if you
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:10.960]  take action D friend a put it in Google right now Google mom them here's a quote
[01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:18.120]  from George Orwell's 1984 again written in 1949 and it's it's very prophetic here
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.360]  he says quote if there was hope it must lie with the parole that's you and me
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.080]  that the lower class people because only there in those swarming disregarded
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:35.280]  masses 85% of the population of Oceania could force to destroy the party ever be
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.440]  generated but the polls if they could only somehow be conscious of their own
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.520]  strength would have no need to conspire if they chose they could blow the party
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:50.960]  to pieces tomorrow morning but they don't believe in their own power he talks
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:55.240]  about how they're obsessed with sports with endless calculations about how to
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.280]  try to win the lottery but then when you talk to the pros about real
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:03.240]  information it's like they can't listen and the culture in the world of 1984
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.880]  was shaped by the Ministry of Truth the propaganda ministry just like the
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.240]  culture people's attitudes are shaped today by the mainstream media just listen
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:19.040]  to this Orwell wrote all beliefs habits tastes emotions mental attitudes that
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.600]  characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.880]  party and to prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.080]  that's that's what we have today you know also to Alex part of part of
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.400]  operation blindfold big brother today I'd like to launch phone mob Friday I'd

[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.760]  know that it already been done last year by other people so it's gonna send
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:03.800]  traffic to a place that that makes no sense stop putting D friend a and folks
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:09.960]  you've got to put in D friend a info wars dot com three words D friend a
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.360]  info wars dot com or they will not go to the mark dice exclusive article so the

[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:46.880]  radio TV and national news they will bite marks done this many times it will
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:50.840]  get him on national TV thinking he's gonna talk bad about Facebook which he
[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:54.400]  is and then he's gonna be able to bring up how it's a surveillance grid this is
[01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:00.560]  a major culture jamming operation if you will take action so D friend a info
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.920]  wars dot com that's the search engine sorry go ahead mark yeah that's okay I
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.880]  want to get into some other creepy stuff here in the book regarding the new ways
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.280]  to listen to children spy on on children and actually listen to them now
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.440]  there's there's little creepy GPS devices that parents are planting on their
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:21.400]  children and there's more and more Barbies with cameras that people can dial
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:25.720]  into and the laptops in Pennsylvania with the schools watching the kids at
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:29.080]  home it's just all happening yeah everybody's familiar with the red
[01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:32.800]  light cameras the photo red cameras out here in San Diego if you blow a red
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:37.320]  light that has a photo red camera you get almost a $500 ticket but what's
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.160]  even more worse is that there are in a few years here maybe sooner they're
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.400]  already testing the system in other countries we're gonna have automatic
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:47.480]  speeding tickets if you just automatically go over the speed limit
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:50.080]  it's just gonna deduct yeah they're gonna put the boxes in your car it's
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.240]  already being tested here in Austin yeah also to their testing systems where if
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.760]  you park in a bus lane it just automatically did take it to you it
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:03.320]  takes your this is a hellish world that we're entering we must stop it yeah
[01:45:03.320 --> 01:45:08.760]  there needs to be some social regulation we can't just let this unroll on us
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:15.120]  and sit back and let them unroll it with the fear-based initiative so there's
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:21.480]  so much here I have patents Alex of implantable GPS devices a company
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.120]  called Persephone which is an occult implication and the Luminati
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.480]  Overtone has a patent back in 2003 or about to submit an application rather
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:37.000]  for a GPS tracking device that implants into your in your body not not like the
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.840]  digital angel that this is a patent to implant the device forcibly into your
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:48.080]  system so you can't remove it I can get into some of the some of the
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:52.160]  information here the device I'm reading right from the application the device
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.320]  may include a microphone or similar device for monitoring acoustic
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.800]  information therefore therefore permitting the person to talk to a remote location
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.560]  this is talking about this is a patent application for forcibly and planting a
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:13.320]  GPS device into your I don't even want to tell you where into into a very very
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.600]  personal part of your body and expanding on that we already see all over the
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.360]  country school kids who are true in a few times now they've got to wear ankle
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:26.760]  bracelets again that they're training everybody for this it's all coming in
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:29.800]  pretty soon we're gonna have para silt and probably take a very chip or
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.480]  something and count how cool it is and it's just the greatest greatest thing
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:38.720]  to do but part of I want to get back to operation phone mob Friday phone mob
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.120]  Fridays some people may have heard some of my phone calls over the past few
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:47.320]  years you can call into these talk shows I call in at the top of the hour they
[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:51.480]  give up the phone numbers or go search the phone number but let's phone mob or
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.560]  we will get dozens of people to jam the Sean Hannity show today we can do other
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.640]  shows later let's get out the word about Facebook deep friend a about the
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:04.240]  Oralean nightmare and let's let's to call the show and the way to get through
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.160]  throwing info wars calm at him whatever you want but the way to get through is
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.680]  whatever idiot topic they're on though oh yeah I want to talk about that and
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.720]  introduce your talk with that act like a stupid liberal that's their favorite bait
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:20.720]  to take go like I don't like him he's bad and and he you go we're gonna put
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:24.320]  your right on and then you can dominate him what have you found the best ways to
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:28.280]  get on these weasel shows I call most show starters the few minutes after the
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.800]  top of the hour so I will start to call at the top of the hour before it even
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:36.240]  goes to air I find the phone number I sit here at my desk and I call read out
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.000]  read out read out you read out for five minutes and then the screener will pick
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.040]  up and you just tell them an interesting topic a question something
[01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:47.000]  you know I don't like to lie to these people so tell them tell them an
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.640]  interesting topic and then maybe when you're on hold if you come up with a
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:55.200]  better question or topic then as soon as you're on the air then you can fire away
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.960]  and speak to hundreds of thousands and you can also look on their website and
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.240]  find out what they're gonna be covering that day so you can be ready and then
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.880]  talk about what they're talking about but then tie it into the truth because
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.880]  see those shows screen their calls we don't here's what I want to do I want to
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.840]  phone lobby system so hard that they're gonna implement a new caller ID based
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:15.760]  system that they're gonna not accept phone calls pretty soon because we're
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.040]  gonna just bring up so many real issues and jam the show with Bilderberg group
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.200]  plugs is Bohemian Grove we're gonna really take over the airwaves and I
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.400]  think that we can be so effective that we're gonna cause them to implement the
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.800]  new caller ID based system so that they're gonna be able to block out the
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:34.520]  quote problem callers like me like others and then they won't they won't
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.600]  accept calls from people with up with a blocked phone number so let's take
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.120]  advantage of this now while we can because this system is probably coming
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:46.440]  very soon where they'll know exactly who you are when you're calling Riley already
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:51.120]  had that years ago and would threaten to send police after folks that mildly
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:55.280]  disagreed yeah Bill O'Reilly has threatened to send the police in this
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:49:00.320]  big box new security to callers homes whether he was trying to scare that
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:03.360]  caller whether they do have a caller ID based system well it turned out he did
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:07.120]  do that it turned out he did he did yeah well they might have a car ID based
[01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.880]  system already because I blocked the car ID and my call when I call on my phone
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:14.240]  when I call a lot of times they will ask me for my phone number and they'll say
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.840]  let me call you back and so I'm not sure what's going on so I have I'm so
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.280]  that it can't do this very much anymore but we that shows how much they don't
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:27.240]  want the people to be able to be heard on the electronic soapbox yeah look just
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:31.160]  imagine folks if you go out and ask Sean Hannity about the Bilderberg group or
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:35.960]  the implantable GPS device or D friend day you're talking to hundreds of
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:41.320]  thousands of people you can you can be a very good activist this way and and

[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:52.240]  to at least five or six year Matt in New York disagrees he goes the head of the
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:57.360]  line you're on the air Matt. Hey Alex hey Mark I'll be brief my
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.040]  disagreement is about Charlie Sheen I think it's great that you support him
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:06.640]  because he is your personal friend and he needs that but I would personally love
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:10.200]  it if you would say your piece about it and then let it go because not all
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:14.080]  publicity is good publicity and I'll just tell you a quick story I was I
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:17.840]  handed out some CDs of your interview with Lindsay Williams which I thought
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:21.840]  was terrific and everyone needs to hear it and somebody took it from me and said
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.680]  Alex Jones isn't that the guy who started the Charlie Sheen rant and he
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:30.640]  kind of looked at me crooked and I'm it it drove me bonkers but what is this I
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:34.040]  mean when he goes on the CNN show the new guy that does Larry King I mean is
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.120]  it I mean is it you know is he bad I mean obviously no one is gonna like
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:41.040]  everything that goes on I didn't even know that was gonna happen and I was
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:46.440]  frankly blindsided by it but then might as well use it to get people to learn
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:49.120]  about the New World Order but I hear you and I appreciate your call Matt
[01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:53.080]  Mark Dice your comments on what he just said yeah you know not everybody's gonna
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.720]  like everything about everybody I mean Alex Jones you're a wild exciting guy
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:02.160]  and in a lot of your audience loves that but you know some people just can't take
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:05.760]  it you cut you're rubbing the wrong way and you know call her mad if that's the
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.560]  case you know it's nobody's perfect and and find you know you can maybe
[01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:13.960]  eloquently convey the information nobody's gonna like everybody everybody
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:17.520]  has an issue with everything but you know we're all just doing the best that
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.760]  we can if you know if you don't like the way Alex presents information you know
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.600]  there's other people like well I'll say this to I've hardly talked about I may
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:28.920]  talk five minutes a day about the Charlie Sheen thing when it's the biggest
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.760]  news story in the country I probably could have already gotten him back on
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:36.080]  folks and we may in the future but I'm not even you know I believe me we're
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.960]  certainly not even milking this when I get invited on national TV though I will
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:43.560]  go on and inject real issues thank you Matt Dave and Chilly you're on the year
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:49.320]  Dave thanks Alex I just wanted to ask Mark dice or when he's gonna hand out
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:56.440]  gold coins again but the real reason that I called was in Chile of course we
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:03.120]  had the dictatorship prior to the dictatorship we had 54 provinces and
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:11.720]  now we have 15 regions in 1979 the dictatorship decided that having 54
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.160]  provinces was too unruly well same thing here with 10 FEMA regions and the 10
[01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.280]  FEMA governors exactly that's the problem the big problem in the United States
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:29.280]  is watch out for FEMA and the 10 regions and so well empires when they
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.640]  conquer a country by stealth or overtly always break things into new political
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:37.840]  jurisdictions to cut the people off from the legislative power centers mark
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:41.640]  dice comments on Dave from Chile yeah you know Dave's comment just for the
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:45.280]  audience knows his comment about my gold coin giving out gold coins it's a
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.640]  reference to a video I did I tried to sell a gold coin to people for 50 bucks
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.520]  and try to trade it for a cup of coffee one off the gold and now nobody really
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.760]  wanted it yeah the general dumb down people what was that in the Malibu area
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:00.560]  you're there with a full beautiful gorgeous gold coin in their hand and
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:04.600]  they're like can I have a cup of coffee a dollar cup for no you can't pal some
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:07.600]  people joke I said oh well they thought it was fake that's why they didn't want to
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.920]  try I redid the video where I offered the gold coin for free prices right
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:15.880]  style you can find this video on YouTube I said hey if you can guess the cost of
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:20.800]  this cool gold coin plus or minus but it was 25% I would give it to them and the
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:25.680]  lowest guess was 38 cents the woman gets 38 cents is how much an ounce of gold
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:29.640]  is worth it was worth about $1100 at the time and I think the highest guess was
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:34.560]  a few hundred bucks that nobody won but they know all about Paris Hilton and
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:38.440]  Charlie Sheen so by breaking in through Charlie Sheen we get the dumboes to
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:41.360]  figure out what's happening

[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:55.160]  incredible with the answer to 1974 1776 campaign we're teaching folks that you
[02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:59.200]  can have victory through resistance with the information right now let's go to
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.480]  Seth in California you're on the air Seth hi Alex I have an idea for your show
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.920]  that's similar to the girl Google search term thing you do okay jealous okay I
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:13.760]  had my explanation written down here all right one way the Illuminati keeps
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.360]  young people brainwashed it's through the pop propping up of pop music stars who
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:20.800]  encourage being a mindless sheep one thing that can be done to fight against
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:24.800]  this is one music videos of these big pop stars are released on a YouTube Alice
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:27.640]  can call for people to go to the official YouTube channel that releases the
[02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:32.440]  videos which is usually the Vivo channel spelled V E V O and vote the video
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.120]  thumbs down many people watch the videos but not many people rate them
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:39.640]  sometimes for every thousand views there's only one rating and anyone with
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:43.080]  a free YouTube account can rate the videos I personally rarely rate the
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:46.720]  YouTube videos but I do pay attention to how they are rated and I would think
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:50.800]  this is the same for many people some key pop stars to go after would be Lady
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:58.880]  Gaga Rihanna Justin Bieber Jay-Z Beyonce and Kesha but also spam them with good
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:06.440]  websites as well great great ideas shat any comments on that mark dice yeah
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.160]  just everybody's doing their thing every every little little way one little
[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:13.600]  comment here one one little comment there you know everybody is working
[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:19.240]  together I think it's great well I I just happened to click on mega news readers

[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:29.280]  the answer to 1974 1776 contest videos all in one spot something we haven't
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.000]  even gotten to yet because you know every day is a new page we've got to link
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.160]  all those pages together on info wars I mean right there it's just all of us
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:40.560]  doing a little something has such a huge effect people you don't have to put
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:44.240]  your own face up there put a website up in front of it do YouTube videos talk
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:47.640]  about issues spend 10 minutes every day you'll start reaching thousands of

[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.120]  you that love liberty show others that we're really the majority I mean mark
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:59.520]  the the Liberty movements the hottest thing right now it is I mean it's a
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.520]  combination of different groups it's it you know the main you'll never hear
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.240]  about we are change or the resistance in the mainstream media you hear about the
[02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:11.240]  tea party but all these different organizations the bond Paul revolution
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:14.960]  the you know the tea party the resistance Luke Radowski and we are
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:18.520]  changed everybody's just working in concert and you know I talked to people

[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:34.120]  talking about a revolution coming and they they feel the pulse on America
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.880]  something's wrong here and let me let me just finish up here with another quote
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.000]  from Orwell where he wrote left to themselves they will continue from
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.760]  generation to generation and from century to century working and dying
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:52.640]  not only without the impulse to rebel but without the power of grasping that
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:58.920]  the whole world could be other than it is so let's not be like that well you're
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:03.280]  right and again as we hurdle towards the world government openly being
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:08.760]  announced we have headed them off at the pass getting the word out and as more of
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:12.600]  this comes true and becomes self-evident our credibility goes up so a lot of
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.760]  people don't know why they're even awake but they know that something's wrong
[02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:19.200]  they know about the globalist they now know the Federal Reserve is the problem
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.760]  in every major poll the sleeping giant is awakening and I just hope that

[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:37.440]  dollar of course their their finance minister also called for that a month
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:41.000]  ago the Chinese have also called for that and the globalist are unified in
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.320]  this our own government is saying it's gonna be great it should happen and
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:48.840]  that there's not gonna be any problems associated with this basically except for
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:52.280]  some market issues yeah how do you like a doubling of prices how do you like
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.000]  destroying people on fixed incomes how do you like the fact we don't have any
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.840]  industry left and won't be able to buy all the slave goods anymore why the
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:03.080]  dollars rain is near an end now that's out of the Wall Street Journal also I
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:05.920]  wanted to talk about this with Bob it's such a big deal it's been out for a
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.880]  week they just announced yeah the SPP means we're going to use foreign troops
[02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:13.400]  in America Canada and Mexico this is out of the Ottawa citizen one of the
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:17.320]  biggest national papers in Canada Canada US agree to use each other's troops in
[02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:22.040]  civil emergencies inside each other's nations tells you about this in in-game
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.600]  it's in the documents now they're rolling it out first oh US troops at the
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:31.520]  Winter Olympics last year all Canadian troops at NLE09 on Mexican troops you
[02:11:31.520 --> 02:11:36.760]  know landing in Florida all of this is happening it's really happening not red

[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.840]  troops incredible also daily mail living in no fly zone an option Obama gives
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:50.000]  strongest indication yet US forces may be deployed in Middle East rebellion
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.240]  continuing Forbes tells you what I told you eight years ago boom today docks
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:01.280]  reveal TSA plan for body scanners at for pedestrians and train passengers then
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:04.360]  it's already in local news they're already doing it with huge high-powered
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:08.560]  systems having people drive their cars under it radiating them off the charts
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:14.160]  above just x-rays or MRIs and with the TSA with National Guard and others
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:19.120]  literally standing around under it being fried I mean this is off the charts
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:25.240]  insane we've got that I mean Bob Chapman's they are trying to just roll
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:29.200]  all this out like it's no big deal I want to get into currencies first with
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:33.200]  you and why do you think they're announcing now that okay the death of
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.760]  the dollar is imminent the Chinese announced yesterday by the end of this
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:42.560]  year just nine months away hard to believe that much time has already
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.040]  elapsed then you know nine and a half months away that they're going to not
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.640]  accept dollars for anything purchased in China raw goods finished goods what
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.240]  that means I mean clearly they're going for the exits and announcing the new
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:59.640]  global SDR as the answer Bob Chapman break it down for us well the global
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:06.120]  SDR cannot be used within in conjunction with gold and most people don't know
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:10.360]  that and I don't think any system that they're going to put together will work
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:15.720]  without a 25% gold backing whether it's a group of currencies quality
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.880]  currencies if you may have any such thing exists or with the dollar and I
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.400]  don't think people should discount the fact that the dollar could remain the
[02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:32.680]  currency of World Reserve now I think the way that they're going to do this
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:37.200]  and I've spoken of this in the program many times before I think they're going
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.760]  to have a meeting they're going to revalue and devalue currencies against
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:47.400]  each other they will have multilateral default what percentages I don't know
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:53.080]  so coordinated default with the G20's been saying for two years yes and my
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.240]  guess is that it'll vary from currency to currency or country to country the
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:03.040]  US I'm looking for two-thirds evaluation in other words you'll have 30 cents in
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:08.760]  each dollar that you've got but I think that there's a good chance that they may
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:18.120]  use the dollar again and once that default and evaluation is in place they
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:23.200]  would have the dollar back 25% by gold where the gold would come from they
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:27.720]  either have it or they can borrow it and they would use that again and I just
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:33.120]  telling people don't discount that but it'll be a dollar which will not be like
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:39.440]  the same that we have now it'll be a great deal less valuable than it is
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.200]  today so that's the thing the way I think they're going to go with this
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:48.320]  timing I've seen that they're making these kinds of announcements will come
[02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:53.600]  over the next several months they may try this before the end of the year but
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:15:02.320]  it's hard to call next why do you know I mean to be specific though even if the
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:06.040]  dollar stays the World Reserve currency that's in a devalued position
[02:15:06.040 --> 02:15:10.960]  yeah absolutely and what they're going to do with debt internally domestically I
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.560]  do not know if they do the right thing they will write the debt down by the
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:21.120]  same amount of money but who knows what the people behind the scenes and the
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:25.360]  people in Wall Street want to do I tell people continue to pay your bills
[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:29.480]  normally and take all of the money that you can and put it in gold and silver
[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:34.680]  related assets and as all these things transpire those will go off and up in
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:39.920]  value and offset any losses that you'll have in the dollar or perhaps any
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:47.440]  unfortunate incidences that you may have with debt okay now this is a question
[02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:53.920]  within a question suddenly us say today yesterday came out and said yes we're
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:57.520]  Kim trailing you to save the earth from global warming yes we're having jets
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:04.360]  with stuff added the fuel spring chemicals in the atmosphere the Ottawa
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:09.160]  citizen and others are saying yes the North American Union's real yes we're
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:14.160]  going to use foreign troops in each other's countries just an off-the-charts
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:19.280]  classical sign of a completely criminal government these this private offshore
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:25.360]  banking cartel is absorbing North America all of this is unfolding why do
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.960]  you think they're so brazen now so in the face all these things they were
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:37.680]  quietly setting up for decades now being announced it's very simple you and other
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:43.960]  people like you on radio as well as in the internet have forced them to move
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:48.960]  forward and come completely into the open they don't have any choice you go
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:54.880]  back to the prison is he's speech of some three years ago and that's how fast
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.360]  time passes and he said look you know these people are hot on our tail they
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:04.680]  know what we're doing they're exposing it we're gonna move fast and they are and
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:08.320]  they're gonna make a lot of mistakes but that's why they're doing what they're
[02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:16.280]  doing and why they're coming into the open Bob you believe and I believe the
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:20.440]  history is clear that that we have a chance to win but how do we get the
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.560]  general public to realize not just awaken but realize how much power they've
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:31.000]  really got well I think the process is being set up and that process is that
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.360]  everybody will be financially and economically perhaps with the exception
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:39.680]  of people would we go related assets they'll be on their knees and they'll be
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.120]  forcing them if you want food you want extended unemployment benefits food
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:48.960]  stamps you gotta join the new world order in general and that's the way that I
[02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:53.640]  think that they intend to do that but at the same time when they make that move
[02:17:53.640 --> 02:17:57.640]  and the people are in that kind of a position a lot of them are saying no I
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:02.000]  don't want to do that and a lot of other people will follow them and you could
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:06.400]  have revolution well that's what the globalist always do it's their tried
[02:18:06.400 --> 02:18:10.120]  and trusted divide and conquer they get half the public on welfare or dependent
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:13.800]  on government contracts the bankers implode the economy cut off the money
[02:18:13.800 --> 02:18:18.840]  themselves and then use the dispossessed hungry masses as a weapon to be
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:22.200]  pointed at what's left for the middle class and people that are awaken aware
[02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:30.240]  who are actually trying to save the country and that's true and and it's
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:35.040]  not only that it's all the machinations that go on in between we've been
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.000]  discussing now for six weeks what's going on in the Middle East and I said
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.160]  first on this program that I felt it was a distraction from the financial and
[02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:50.480]  economic problems the United States Great Britain in Europe and then we found
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:55.760]  out shortly thereafter that Frank Wisner had and he's a former high official in
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:04.080]  the in the central intelligence agency had visited Mr. Mubarak about a month
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.320]  before this all happened and as far as I'm concerned he must have given a
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:16.520]  marching orders and I think that the end result of what's going on in the
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:23.760]  Middle East and North Africa now is to keep nations neutralized in some form
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:32.960]  of this quiet or even chaotic condition so that no one can assist Iran if the
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:39.400]  government's gonna go after Iran when we come back Bob I want to get into the TSA

[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.520]  that social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:23.240]  might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:27.160]  the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:31.240]  looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold or the realists there

[02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:16.280]  I got a whole cornucopia of important news we want to pick Bob Chapman's intellect on but as I
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.200]  told you we're going to start really pushing twitter.com forward slash real
[02:24:19.200 --> 02:24:25.160]  Alex Jones with your daily questions inside info for Twitter followers and
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:28.400]  we're trying to make the number one search term today Alex Jones Twitter so
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:31.360]  please put that in Google over and over again want to salute all of you that are
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.520]  doing that I guess it's going to be an important tool we want to dominate that
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:39.440]  like we've dominated everything else I've got a few questions here though that
[02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:44.520]  came in off of Twitter one several for Bob Chapman a whole bunch for me it goes
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:51.920]  on to say Alex what is your favorite anti-terror quote JB YRD Street asked
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:58.440]  that question it have to be I have sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:02.240]  against every form of tyranny over the mind of men Thomas Jefferson in fact
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.400]  guys can you queue up that liner I think we have it dry just with the Thomas
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:09.640]  Jefferson and because I think I paraphrased it a bit there and while
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.320]  they're getting that queued up Bob we have a couple questions here for you Bob
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:19.880]  Chapman they asked the question it was actually HM HM AA asked me about my
[02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:24.040]  favorite quote it was J Bird Street that asked Bob Chapman how would you hold a
[02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:29.880]  gold or silver proofs uncirculated or bars and then we have another question
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:35.000]  here saying is it possible to dissolve the fellow reserve so Bob will you take
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:42.440]  both those questions please well my favorite is bullion coins both in a
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:51.240]  silver and in gold occasionally men's state a graded numismatic coins depending
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:26:00.120]  upon the pricing structure but that's where most of what I have is the other
[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:04.680]  part of the question was well they asked the question you know can we
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:09.320]  abolish the fellow reserve that's it it's possible but I don't think it's
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:16.400]  probable that is the key to the control of the American people and probably the
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.200]  finances of the world that's dropping the coin into the crack of doom and
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:23.720]  Mordor that's the big win yeah and that's going to be very very difficult
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:30.120]  because they bought Congress they own 95% of it and so unless we're
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:34.920]  successful in removing the incumbents from Congress and getting people in
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:39.480]  there who will vote properly in our behalf then nothing's going to happen
[02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:47.520]  show to revolution let's go ahead and play that quote I have sworn upon the
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:54.200]  altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:27:02.800]  man Thomas Jefferson it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network okay so there you
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:08.680]  go there's my favorite quote Bob the TSA there's now no doubt it's in Forbes
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:12.960]  it's NAP they are running checkpoints all over the country they are sticking
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.160]  hands down pants they are driving people under high-powered radiation machines
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:22.520]  while the idiot local trained police under TSA control stand around roasting
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.760]  scanning hundreds of cars I mean it's like they know something's not going to
[02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:31.960]  be here in the future or something frying all their own minions I mean the
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:38.120]  globalists are just so brazen Bob well frying their minions is not important to
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:42.920]  them as we know they'd like to get rid of 60 to 80 percent of the people in the
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:49.240]  planet anyway and to them they'll eventually be useless eaters but there's
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:55.520]  one aspect that we haven't talked about here and that is now they want to check
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.000]  the genetic design of people well they're doing this process I'm sorry it's
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.160]  always worse than I say that's right they're gonna take a cheek swab of your
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:09.520]  tissue now when you fly isn't that nice unbelievable setting the precedent to
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:13.120]  get in our bodies as I've been saying with the federal funds to have police
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.360]  take blood at warrantless checkpoints that's right and that's another one I
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:23.520]  didn't even think of I mean they are just pushing and pushing and pushing and
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:31.440]  we've got to push back we got to bring it to the the attention of the general
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:34.800]  public you don't have to put up with this you shouldn't have to put up with
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:40.520]  this and complain to your congressman and senators complain to the local law
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:43.440]  enforcement if they're involved in it well that's the good news all over the
[02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:47.480]  country state-surpassing laws why I don't know it's already illegal for TSA to
[02:28:47.480 --> 02:28:51.200]  stick their hands down your pants or even on the outside on your genitals
[02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:55.320]  but they're saying we're gonna arrest you TSA if you do this so the states are
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:00.920]  bucking up and saying no well I think that's fantastic and I hope to pass it
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:07.520]  quickly especially in large states like New York, California, Illinois, Texas you
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:12.400]  know and in Georgia where you get a lot of plain traffic you know one of the
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:16.640]  things that hasn't brought out I don't think it's brought up brought out in the
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:21.920]  program and that is what they and I don't know what group this is I'll call
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.680]  it homeland security are they are checking people getting on in our planes
[02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:33.320]  now and they have dogs and the dogs identify certain things like gold
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:41.400]  silver money etc and if the dog is allowed bark I guess they grab this
[02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:46.280]  person online and find out what they're carrying and so that's another thing that
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:49.960]  you have to watch out for absolutely Bob let's come back take phone calls get
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:56.120]  into the economy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:59.640]  GCN radio network
[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:06.240]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:11.760]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:15.520]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[02:30:15.520 --> 02:30:20.560]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:25.920]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:30.840]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:35.240]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:39.000]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.920]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:48.440]  like nobody does care right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:54.160]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:13.800]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:17.520]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the

[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:25.400]  TSA total tentament violation it's worse than them rolling it out admitting it
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:32.480]  he gave me USA today this just came out this morning homeland security looked
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:36.640]  into covert body scans they've decided to go with public ones on the street
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:41.360]  mobile trucks vans big scanners you drive under just frying you shooting
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:44.760]  through metal dwarfing an ex you know a regular chest x-ray doesn't go through
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:50.160]  thick metal I mean this is blasting you now they've announced this week that they
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:53.840]  want to go ahead and have chest x-ray type whole body deals in Australia and
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.720]  in the US now they're announcing that they're looking at it being secret and
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:01.080]  not letting you know when you drive under it on the highway but they decided
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.400]  to go ahead and just do it to you I mean this is a salt Bob you know they're
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:08.800]  going to the Austin airport where I live now I'll be driving down the highway
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:13.480]  I'll know what an x-ray array is I can't drive under it they've put metal
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:17.360]  barriers up all over Texas so I can't go around it and I've got to submit to
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:23.680]  high-power radiation I mean this is out of an science fiction joke well what
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:30.040]  they want to do I think is not on again information on people but I think it's
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:37.200]  a form of getting rid of people because some people may be or may be in a
[02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:44.560]  position where they are easily subject to disease from using these machines like
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.760]  cancer well the license plate reader will know you're coming and when Alex
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.680]  Jones drives under it the computer hits it with 20 times the power could very
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:59.920]  these are these are public fry grids they're putting in well I don't know
[02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:04.840]  what the answer is to that other than people demonstrating man these people
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:08.840]  are just don't want to do anything look the TSA are terrorists homeland
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:13.800]  security are terrorists they carried out 9-11 FEMA is involved and they are now
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:20.320]  publicly putting public friars in I mean it's just it's unspeakable Bob it's
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:25.280]  like a joke it's like a satire of a tyranny imagine a futuristic world
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:29.440]  where they have you drive under high-powered radiation and have the
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:33.760]  cops stand around it with no shielding and the cops are like you know kind of
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:41.740]  a lot getting cancer well I think a good place to start would be with law
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:45.280]  enforcement saying you know what they're doing to you and you're probably
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:49.640]  going to be dead within two to three years if not sooner I think maybe you
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:53.400]  ought to tell these people you don't want to do that and by the way the troops
[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:57.160]  detonated hundreds of chemical weapons bunkers that the alarms all went off at
[02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:01.200]  1991 thousands and thousands of the troops died hundreds of thousands ill
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:04.440]  that the major universities did brainstem studies that were full of
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:07.920]  sarin nerve gas they didn't give you treatment last year they announced
[02:38:07.920 --> 02:38:12.080]  they secretly stolen the death benefits of all the troops Bloomberg AP I mean
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:15.480]  get it through your heads cops and military the globalist hates you even
[02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:19.200]  more than they hate us get it through your head you're on our team even if you
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:26.360]  don't know it and whether you like it or not I can't believe it Bob I can't
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:29.640]  believe it I just can't handle it anymore let's go to some phone calls here
[02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:35.560]  making me sick Christian New Hampshire you're on the air hi Alex are you doing
[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:41.320]  just completely freaked out I mean it just gets crazier by the minute I just
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:47.080]  got a question for Bob and one for you Alex I got disabled at a young age and
[02:38:47.080 --> 02:38:51.960]  obviously I'm on social security disability and with everything going on
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:57.480]  and the dollar crashing I've been trying to take the bull by the horns and I'm
[02:38:57.480 --> 02:39:01.960]  thinking about getting some silver putting you this side because I got
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:07.560]  disabled at such a young age didn't really prepare for my future and if I
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:13.440]  accumulate silver and try to get some gold if they do go this one world
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:18.640]  currency how do I exchange whatever the inflation has been you exchange it for
[02:39:18.640 --> 02:39:22.200]  the currency of your choice and then that stops the inflation under the
[02:39:22.200 --> 02:39:30.600]  classical model okay not perfect now sir now it would be a good idea for me to
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:34.560]  you know invest a little bit of silver because of the situation that I am in
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:38.560]  because you know I've been trying to save paper money but I've been really
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:41.760]  getting informed I've been a listener for now for two years and I'm really
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:45.600]  been watching how the world events have been going on here and I'm not a
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:50.720]  paranoid type but I just need to have a little bit of a direction I mean the
[02:39:50.720 --> 02:39:55.820]  scenario you should never pay more than one or two percent above spot for gold
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:40:02.480]  or silver and I go for junk or I go for bullion that is quite frankly semi
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.960]  numismatic I mean it has a collector value but if you go to places like
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:10.920]  Midas you can get collector coins at bullion prices because Ted Anderson is
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.400]  hyper competitive Chris I appreciate your call but if you really don't have a
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:17.920]  lot of money the biggest thing is a little bit of emergency storeable food
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.560]  firearms and family and friends you can trust let's talk to Tony and Marilyn
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:26.200]  Tony you're on the air hey what's going on I have to say I won the lottery
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.640]  hey um I have a question for you actually it's more on that one of the
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:33.520]  movies you ever made was on top of that of annual financial reports that then
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:37.640]  one actually better it's a violating Mary Croft it's called on how I club or
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:43.040]  every bureaucratic cash cop is good cash cop is your dirty agency no demand
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:46.320]  it's definitely a book you check out I sent your listeners already or to your
[02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:49.800]  email listen Tony that's awesome but your phone's breaking up a bit do you
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:55.440]  have a question or comment for Bob Chapman anything else because I could
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.480]  I could hear a little bit better now I want you to hit the Mary I'm I was I
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:03.520]  wouldn't go to listen to the Mary Croft book have you gone on google.com
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:06.760]  to have Mary Croft it's informational definitely been a criminal federal
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:12.360]  government down okay how do you say her last name again Mary Croft Croft
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:17.480]  like I'm on CR OFP got it thank you so much yeah a brief take on
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:25.600]  comprehensive annual financial reports the double set of books Bob it seems to
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:33.320]  be generally hidden the municipalities won't talk about it it can't get a
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:42.280]  hearing anywhere people don't believe it it's a very hard sell but it seems to
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:48.600]  be there oh it's there and by the way we've uploaded annual copper annual
[02:41:48.600 --> 02:41:52.840]  comprehensive financial reports exposed to the info warrior director channel
[02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:59.840]  that we have folks let's talk to who's up next here John Adam in California you're
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:04.840]  on the air with Bob Chapman hey Alex thanks for having me on I wanted to talk
[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:09.000]  with you really quickly about the globalist agenda and how it pertains to
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.200]  the geopolitical situation in the Middle East and how the events are being
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.780]  controlled at least from the Muslim perspective I know Glenn Beck usually
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:21.960]  bites a lot of your style takes a lot of your talking points but one thing that
[02:42:21.960 --> 02:42:26.960]  he's spoken about that you really haven't is the Imam Mahdi situation and how
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:30.440]  the religious events in the Middle East are being controlled now a lot of
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:33.480]  Muslims do think it's the end of the world as well just like Christians do
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:37.760]  and that is even if it was true it's a manipulation to get people to give in and
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:41.840]  not fight tyranny because it's all about to end anyways and there's major
[02:42:41.840 --> 02:42:47.040]  foundation globalist funding in the last 150 years pushing that Bob Chapman I
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:54.800]  agree and some of the elements under the surface one must remember and if you
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:59.040]  don't know it now you will that the Muslim Brotherhood was funded in the
[02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:06.480]  1920s by MI6 and that was taken up with the CIA after its formation and in the
[02:43:06.480 --> 02:43:11.960]  late 40s and that's not debated by the way what's that that's not debated no
[02:43:11.960 --> 02:43:16.040]  that's a public fact because I have people sending me emails saying you're
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:19.800]  making that up now you're saying the Muslims are bad no this group on record
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:23.880]  is there to stir stuff up to turn that place into a fire pit I'm sorry go ahead
[02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:30.040]  and you're absolutely great and I always fight the two divisions that the
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:34.200]  Grand Mufti of Jerusalem sent to the Second World War to fight with Germany
[02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:40.360]  against the Russians so this is a quasi fascistic organization that many many
[02:43:40.360 --> 02:43:47.320]  Muslims probably do not know what their agenda is and who controls them well
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:50.320]  said Bob now I want to shift gears now then we'll come back in the final
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:54.200]  segment and talk to Tracy Frank and a few others with Bob Chapman of the
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:58.560]  international forecaster calm but the five minutes we've got before break gold
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:03.760]  silver are exploding oil is exploding all of this predicted you got a hand at
[02:44:03.760 --> 02:44:06.880]  the Lindsay Williams got a hand at the Bob Chapman but we know there's dollar
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:10.720]  devaluation happening so that's going to continue to drive this but I wanted to
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:14.840]  bring Ted Anderson in to tell us today's gold and silver prices and then we'll get
[02:44:14.840 --> 02:44:19.680]  Bob's take on these prices how good they are Ted Anderson yeah hey thanks for
[02:44:19.680 --> 02:44:24.080]  having me up Alex I can tell you right now goal is at 1433 40 at the high today
[02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:29.680]  silver went over 35 dollars an ounce 3545 today just to you know like you said
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:34.320]  going up like a rocket ship dollars dropping the Libyan oil thing I mean an
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.840]  oil over a hundred dollars a barrel hundred four dollars a barrel what we
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:41.880]  have right now is I do have your videos I had to price them up a little bit
[02:44:41.880 --> 02:44:46.360]  because silver's just gone through the roof yes special for three silver
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:50.000]  dollars ninety seven dollars with free shipping and three of my films that was
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.320]  a seventy dollar discount it had to go up because you ran out of those supplies
[02:44:53.320 --> 02:44:56.840]  this deal still great what's the price today well here's the thing Alex
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:00.320]  Silver's gone up ten dollars an ounce since I priced those though that deal
[02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:04.560]  should be thirty dollars higher than it was when I priced it at ninety set or
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  twenty seven dollars an ounce we are currently selling the same thing at a
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.720]  hundred and ten and the reason why I'm holding the price down on this is because
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.720]  I'm just so pleased that we have thousands and I'm not talking about
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:21.720]  hundreds thousands of people getting your videos right now and thousands of
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.720]  people getting silver dollars in their hands which are going to be money I mean
[02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:29.840]  this is the cost let's be clear then at spot then the three coins should cost a
[02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.480]  hundred and five dollars you're selling it for a hundred and ten and the
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:36.920]  shipping's more than the five with three films Obama deception for the
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:41.560]  Republic in game just as cherries on top to give people out there to wake them
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:47.560]  up so that's really about a hundred and seventy five dollar value for a hundred
[02:45:47.560 --> 02:45:52.720]  and five how good of a deal is that Bob Chapman it is perfect to go get it
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.440]  all right eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six
[02:45:57.440 --> 02:46:01.320]  eight six two two three seven Ted how long with silver what's silver today I
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:05.160]  know it's up even more yeah silver went up three percent over three percent
[02:46:05.160 --> 02:46:09.600]  three point three nine where is it now thirty thirty five forty five was the
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:13.520]  high forty five forty one currently I mean it is just out of this world so so
[02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:17.840]  to get those at spot it would actually be over a hundred and six dollars so you're
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:20.920]  talking a hundred and ten for the three coins which by the way are semi-nomismatic
[02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:24.440]  most these coins are about a hundred years old right Ted yep they are there
[02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:28.720]  the old silver dollars that are either 1921 or older summer Morgan summer

[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:58.800]  bag is going to be closer to twenty eight hundred dollars it's now takes twenty
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:04.480]  five of the today's dime to buy one dime of nineteen sixty four I'll give the

[02:48:31.840 --> 02:48:36.240]  eight hundred six eight six two three seven Bob Chapman briefly we're come back
[02:48:36.240 --> 02:48:41.360]  to take some calls where do you see all of this going where do you see gold and
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.400]  silver going right now what significant was the pullback of yesterday created by
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:52.040]  the US government as usual and the tremendous turnaround in the comics
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:57.320]  market today to the upside I saw gold up as much as fifteen ten during the day
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:03.440]  and silver I think was up about a dollar ten and this is stopping this you've got
[02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:07.880]  to be in there you've got to be buying these coins this has got a long long way
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:12.720]  to go what do I think it's going in the immediate future gold can easily go to
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:16.440]  sixteen fifty which is about three hundred dollars higher than what it is

[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:16.160]  standard time and a jam in a few final phone calls here or Bob Chapman
[02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:21.480]  Tracy in Texas you're on the air thanks for holding thanks I gotta go one for
[02:53:21.480 --> 02:53:30.200]  you Alex one for you Bob a few weeks ago a group of XJP Morgan traders that
[02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:35.120]  were disgruntled and got fired from J.C. Morgan created a hedge fund group the
[02:53:35.120 --> 02:53:39.600]  name of them is where Benton and they have gone in and they have bought a
[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:45.120]  little over 4,000 contracts and they're standing for delivery well it turns out
[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:51.560]  this night that J.P. Dork Morgan does not have the silver in order to fulfill the
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:59.280]  contract J.P. Morgan has told these people you will give you 80% premium to
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:04.240]  settle in cash if you don't do it we'll pay everybody else first and then we'll
[02:54:04.240 --> 02:54:10.400]  default on you my question is how do we beat these people when they're when
[02:54:10.400 --> 02:54:13.360]  they're really are beating them they can drive it down for a little while but
[02:54:13.360 --> 02:54:18.080]  always beats balls back up Bob Chapman well we just saw that yesterday into
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:24.000]  today and maybe those players and I know who the group is I have accomplished
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:30.000]  what they want let them do that take Morgan to the mat make Morgan default
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:36.880]  and what will happen then is that the trading in silver and gold on the comics
[02:54:36.880 --> 02:54:42.160]  will almost cease and that'll be the end of the paper game it'll blow out all the
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:48.080]  options and the derivatives and it'll destroy SLV and GLD and that's what Max
[02:54:48.080 --> 02:54:55.240]  Kaiser's been hammering and Max is absolutely correct and that's the way to
[02:54:55.240 --> 02:55:00.760]  take you you can't let these people intimidate you when they bring the battle
[02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:05.360]  to you you go right into their face that's the only way to do it Tracy thank
[02:55:05.360 --> 02:55:09.680]  you Aaron and Nevada you're on the air with Bob Chapman thank you very much
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:14.000]  this is going on radio calling again thank you very much Bob listen to what
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:17.360]  Bob said when he answered your question he said demonstrate and I think that's
[02:55:17.360 --> 02:55:19.840]  what we got to do and you've been kind of shying away from that second thing I
[02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:23.720]  want to say is excuse me I haven't been I haven't been against demonstrating okay
[02:55:23.720 --> 02:55:28.520]  okay fine now hold on when did I say don't demonstrate I've called you before
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:31.960]  and you say you don't want to organize take your info war listeners and put
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:36.000]  them in the street all right listen I appreciate your call sir I had I had Max
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:40.200]  Kaiser on saying demonstrate yesterday I have Bob Chapman saying it I tell people
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:42.960]  go out and get in the street and be active and it's not that I don't mind
[02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:47.400]  being criticized but why is it never legitimate okay I mean I'm trying I'm
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.800]  working 18 hours a day sometimes I'm trying I can't do everything I can't
[02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:57.920]  leader I'm not all powerful don't you understand that Bob Chapman I mean do
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:04.320]  you have any comments to what Aaron just said well I think Aaron is in a position
[02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:09.800]  where he would like to think see things happen more quickly and and I can
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:15.920]  understand that but there's a time to do everything and we're getting close to
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:20.760]  the time for major demonstrations particularly with which is the TSA is
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:26.040]  doing and it's going I've been leading those I've been I mean I never can do
[02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:29.440]  enough misinterpret maybe I mean I'm not gonna do this but maybe be happy if I
[02:56:29.440 --> 02:56:34.080]  just quit because I'm so bad that I work so hard I'm the problem I'm the evil
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.640]  not the fellow reserve not the new old order it's all my fault Bob of course not
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:44.640]  and you know that no we the slings of narrows of outrageous fortune to quote
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:48.160]  the Bard is something that you and I ain't gonna have to put up with and
[02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:53.960]  that's what we have to live with and very often when people say things that
[02:56:53.960 --> 02:56:57.960]  they mean them and sometimes they don't and you got to take over the grain yeah
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:01.600]  but it's always this moral judgment they call it and tell me how I did
[02:57:01.600 --> 02:57:05.480]  something wrong and they're better than me and then and that's their big coat of
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:09.720]  arms in life is that they showed the big Alex Jones and it doesn't hurt me that
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:13.960]  they're attacking myself it hurts me for them I'm like you know tell me where

[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:54.880]  thanks for calling you're on the air with Bob Chapman hey Alex thanks a lot
[02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:58.720]  thanks you know for what you're doing it is definitely appreciated two questions
[02:59:58.720 --> 03:00:02.240]  for both you gentlemen just just one question with regards to the dollar
[03:00:02.240 --> 03:00:06.560]  devaluation and something I'm curious about if the dollar is being devalued
[03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:10.640]  then wouldn't you the debt that you know middle-class Americans and by
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:15.120]  extension even Canadians oh also be devalued being paid back in nominal
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:18.960]  dollar pardon me and in yes nominal wrong people that were invested in it
[03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:23.800]  everywhere Bob we don't know how they're gonna do it and you won't know
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:29.680]  until you get there what they should do is reduce the debt whatever percentage
[03:00:29.680 --> 03:00:34.320]  the dollar falls if they don't throw that and they call for the debt at the
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:39.600]  higher level present levels everybody will go broke and so I don't know which
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.880]  way it's going to go next question I have is something that came up on from
[03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:49.560]  an historical point of view something called the silver ratio where historically
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.600]  silver's been valued 16 to 1 16 times silver to one time gold how true is
[03:00:54.600 --> 03:00:58.640]  that is that historical reflection of what has actually taken place in past
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:04.560]  alright thank you got a jump Bob it did it has happened in the past it was used
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:10.320]  by governments for a long time but we're into a different era now and three
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:14.640]  thousand years ago the finest suit was a ounce of gold and you can buy an
[03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:19.680]  incredibly nice suit for 1400 bucks today let's go ahead and talk to same
[03:01:19.680 --> 03:01:23.320]  with silver you know the same ratios let's go ahead and take another call
[03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:29.600]  here let's talk to Chris in Arizona oh hey Alex hey my call I appreciate it
[03:01:29.600 --> 03:01:32.320]  it's cool that you really don't screen your calls like I've heard you said
[03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:37.240]  numerous times but anyways I know that's a lie you're a fake caller to a Vatican
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:42.960]  assassin go ahead back in assassin I woke up I actually woke up researching the
[03:01:42.960 --> 03:01:47.000]  stock market and eventually researching the Federal Reserve and like the truth
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:51.240]  just spoke for itself and then I came across people like David Ike and Michael
[03:01:51.240 --> 03:01:57.240]  Terry and yourself and Mike my Kaiser Max Kaiser anyway my question I noticed
[03:01:57.240 --> 03:02:02.180]  in Arizona a company by the name of G4S security is rolling around private
[03:02:02.180 --> 03:02:07.120]  buses all the time and I looked it up online and that's actually a private
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:11.280]  company based out of London and now it's kind of frustrating to me and then
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:14.160]  another thing yeah a lot of the contracting isn't spent with local
[03:02:14.160 --> 03:02:17.280]  companies it's spent with foreigners so the money never comes back we're out of
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:21.840]  time comments on that Bob I don't have any because I don't know I don't know
