[00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.110]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.890]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.651]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.651 --> 00:00:11.231]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:12.771]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:16.972]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:21.073]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:27.795]  We are live.
[00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.937]  It is Friday, the fourth day of March 2011.
[00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:38.586]  We're going to be here for the next three hours and of course we're having our once a week visit today.
[00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:41.108]  We always have with Bob Chapman.
[00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:46.454]  Coming up in one hour, Mark Dice is going to be joining us talking about his new book,
[00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:50.278]  That is only available at Infowars.com.
[00:00:50.278 --> 00:00:54.003]  Big brother, the Orwellian nightmare come true.
[00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:59.529]  Very powerful information coming up in the second and third hours today.
[00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:04.936]  Okay, the mainstream media is finally starting to be pulled along by the people of the United States.
[00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:21.795]  And they're admitting that, yes, the TSA does indeed have a plan to, and is now rolling out that plan, to occupy every town and city of the United States with high-powered, full-body x-ray systems, checkpoints.
[00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.197]  This is total federal takeover.
[00:01:24.197 --> 00:01:31.063]  And here's the headline in Forbes, Docs Reveal TSA Plan to Body Scan Pedestrians, Train Passengers.
[00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:41.151]  Now we told you this eight years ago, that they were going to take over the streets of America because the head of Homeland Security said so.
[00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:54.782]  Just like we read the SPP documents that we got in 2007 and they stated in the North American Union Agreement that they're going to have Mexican and Canadian tribes patrolling America and vis-a-vis each other's countries in the North American continent.
[00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:56.573]  Boom!
[00:01:56.573 --> 00:02:03.942]  It's in mainstream news all over Canada, not in the United States, that, oh yes, each other's armies to help suppress daring riots.
[00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:05.283]  Foreign troops.
[00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:06.344]  Boom!
[00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:07.706]  It's a big deal.
[00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:09.087]  It's happening.
[00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:16.075]  And on the TSA issue, there's a big report out today by Steve Watson.
[00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:27.401]  And the headline is TSA Controversy Explodes Scandals, Criminality, Security Failures, and Uncovered Plans to Enhance Agency's Reach.
[00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:31.686]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:37.952]  Also, top computer expert at the TED Conference says, no doubt, the evidence is clear, U.S.
[00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:39.174]  government slash Israel.
[00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:40.434]  We're good to go.
[00:03:00.276 --> 00:03:01.236]  Alex Jones, U.S.
[00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:02.897]  media doesn't speak for us.
[00:03:02.897 --> 00:03:05.137]  Hillary says we're losing the info war.
[00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:07.478]  That is the globalists that have hijacked this country.
[00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:10.538]  So we're going to be breaking that down as well.
[00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:13.899]  Utah considers return to gold and silver coins.
[00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.200]  Obviously, I want to continue the discussion from yesterday's news articles.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.700]  Why the dollar's reign is nearing an end.
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.401]  Wall Street Journal and others reporting that.
[00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:26.103]  Also, the Sheening of America.
[00:03:26.103 --> 00:03:32.007]  In less than a week, troubled actor Charlie Sheen becomes country's top pop culture icon.
[00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:34.029]  And they've done different analyses and breakdowns.
[00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.431]  He's bigger than John Wayne, bigger than Marilyn Monroe.
[00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:39.533]  And it's because he's not being a hypocrite.
[00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:45.197]  I don't endorse, you know, everything he's saying or doing, but he is my friend, and he's been going through a lot.
[00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:49.119]  And the point is, he's saying, I'm gonna be 100% real, and I'm not gonna be a hypocrite.
[00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.282]  And that's what people recognize and appreciate is the truthfulness.
[00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:58.288]  And it's just getting bigger and bigger and crazier by the minute.
[00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:09.536]  I talked a lot to Charlie yesterday, talked to him this morning, and I just hope this whole thing ends well because I care about him, I care about his courage coming out for 9-11 Truth.
[00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:13.238]  I've known the calm, focused, intelligent Charlie Sheen.
[00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:16.140]  People are calling him a poet, a great comedian.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.164]  All of these words he's come out with and terms are becoming cultural icons now, and a lot of it
[00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:21.864]  Is
[00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:40.071]  I made the joke about how people say we're warlock Vatican assassins.
[00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.492]  Folks, he's not a ninja.
[00:04:41.492 --> 00:04:43.634]  He's not a warlock Vatican assassin.
[00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:44.735]  That's a joke.
[00:04:44.735 --> 00:04:46.796]  And he said, people don't get my satire.
[00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:48.077]  They don't get my joke.
[00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:53.321]  You know, put a little bit of hieroglyph into your mind to understand what I'm saying, but people don't get it.
[00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:59.506]  Well, I'm going to be doing a video later today where I may even do it on air, where I break down exactly what Charlie's saying.
[00:05:00.106 --> 00:05:04.647]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:05.568]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.568 --> 00:05:08.989]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:09.849]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.751]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:15.491]  It's true.
[00:05:15.491 --> 00:05:20.352]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:21.193]  Number 3.
[00:05:21.193 --> 00:05:24.774]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:28.475]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:29.476]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.238]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:35.921]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.701]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.844]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:45.608]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:50.071]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.852]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.852 --> 00:05:54.114]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.114 --> 00:05:56.456]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:05:59.932 --> 00:06:03.753]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot Movement.
[00:06:03.753 --> 00:06:08.034]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:13.134]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:18.675]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:06:18.675 --> 00:06:22.336]  Not worried about them moving south.
[00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.717]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:35.954]  We're American and be proud.
[00:06:35.954 --> 00:06:38.357]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:06:57.347 --> 00:07:03.650]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.950]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.352]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:15.294]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:15.294 --> 00:07:17.435]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:17.435 --> 00:07:20.116]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:26.962]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:07:26.962 --> 00:07:29.184]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:34.508]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:39.473]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:45.160]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.363]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:51.367]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:07:51.367 --> 00:07:52.368]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:08.267]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.267 --> 00:08:11.250]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:21.434]  Okay, coming up today on this live, March 4th, 2011, Friday edition, Immigration Wars.
[00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:24.835]  More states looking at Arizona-style laws.
[00:08:24.835 --> 00:08:30.637]  Heaven forbid they have Mexico-style laws where they put you in a forced labor camp for a year and then throw you out of the country.
[00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:35.599]  I'm against Mexican-style immigration laws that are completely hypocritical when the U.S.
[00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:39.221]  basically has no immigration law and is wide open and going bankrupt.
[00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:42.124]  Also, ATF let hundreds of U.S.
[00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:45.628]  weapons fall into hands of suspected Mexican gunrunners.
[00:08:45.628 --> 00:08:50.594]  ATF was ordered, this is one of their own top agents saying this, to allow the guns into Mexico.
[00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:51.996]  Of course!
[00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:55.200]  They're only there to disarm old vets and farmers and people.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.562]  Huge news on that front.
[00:08:58.562 --> 00:09:01.784]  Utah considers returning to gold and silver coins.
[00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:04.125]  That's Fox News.
[00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:09.628]  More on what's happening with the ongoing battles in Wisconsin and other states.
[00:09:09.628 --> 00:09:10.189]  We're also
[00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:21.516]  Going to get into the fact that even Forbes is reporting that the TSA is rolling out onto the streets of America with high-powered body scanners and Steve Watson's got a report detailing that.
[00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:29.021]  I've got a lot of really important economic news as well but Mark Dice talking about the rollout of his new book
[00:09:29.915 --> 00:09:37.160]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, his best book yet, will be joining us to go over the Orwellian parallels to our modern society.
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.122]  Quite frankly, I think it's worse than 1984 in many respects.
[00:09:40.122 --> 00:09:43.484]  He'll be joining us to discuss Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[00:09:43.484 --> 00:09:47.407]  By the way, this book starts shipping the 21st of this month.
[00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:48.327]  They've now been printed.
[00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:50.088]  They're in transit being shipped here.
[00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:52.630]  We're helping Mark out because he doesn't have a fulfillment center.
[00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.611]  The only place to get it for the
[00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.393]  Next week we'll be talking about Infowars!
[00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:18.889]  Now, I was on Russia Today for 15 minutes.
[00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:20.630]  I had several different segments.
[00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:27.276]  We're just going to play a four-minute clip of me joining them via video Skype.
[00:10:27.276 --> 00:10:34.582]  Powerful information that we covered dealing with Hillary Clinton saying they're losing the info war.
[00:10:34.582 --> 00:10:36.504]  Well, America isn't losing the info war.
[00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:40.307]  The people that have hijacked our nation are beginning to lose the info war.
[00:10:40.307 --> 00:10:42.529]  And there she is before Congress begging
[00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:52.593]  For tens of billions more to propagandize foreigners and us here domestically and they admit their bullets are basically empty.
[00:10:52.593 --> 00:10:57.614]  Their clip is empty and people know that they're a bunch of liars.
[00:10:57.614 --> 00:11:06.257]  So we're going to play this clip and then we are going to come back and launch into all of the vital news and information on this Live Friday edition.
[00:11:06.257 --> 00:11:06.537]  Here it is.
[00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:10.132]  So time to amp up the message machine, I guess.
[00:11:10.132 --> 00:11:14.893]  And who better to talk to about this than radio host Alex Jones.
[00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:16.173]  Hey there, Alex.
[00:11:16.173 --> 00:11:17.054]  Lots to talk about.
[00:11:17.054 --> 00:11:22.095]  Secretary of Clinton obviously fighting for more funding for the State Department's media budget.
[00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:25.236]  But she says we are in a quote, information war.
[00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:29.317]  She wants more money than most of the other international stations combined.
[00:11:29.317 --> 00:11:32.398]  Your take, Alex, on the sides, the many sides, I guess, of this war.
[00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:38.856]  Well, it's good to be here, and obviously I have the website Infowars.com, so we're focused on this.
[00:11:38.856 --> 00:11:41.297]  I want to be clear, I'm an American patriot.
[00:11:41.297 --> 00:11:44.438]  I believe in my constitutional republic.
[00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:50.040]  I get a tear in my eye when I go to a football game and hear the Star-Spangled Banner.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.721]  When the State Department talks about
[00:11:52.501 --> 00:12:10.573]  Losing the info war and getting media dominance again in the world They're talking about the select group of offshore globalists that in the last 50 years Have used the United States as an engine of their own private corporate War against sovereign countries and taking over the planet.
[00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:21.801]  This is all admitted and so what's happened is so-called US television and print media the Washington Post the New York Times have lied about WMDs that didn't exist have lied about
[00:12:22.581 --> 00:12:23.462]  Terror threats.
[00:12:23.462 --> 00:12:31.026]  The former head of Homeland Security, Governor Ridge, wrote a book last year admitting they would issue fake terror alerts for political gain.
[00:12:31.026 --> 00:12:40.190]  And so the American people realize that our media doesn't speak for us and is being used basically to propagandize not just us but the world.
[00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.713]  And so it's not just people in other countries that aren't buying into, quote, US media.
[00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:46.434]  It's the American people
[00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.416]  And the globalists are out of bullets.
[00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:57.686]  I mean, just last year when they were demonizing Rand Paul in his Senate run, Politico called me and they said, well, what do you see being able to stop Rand Paul?
[00:12:57.686 --> 00:12:58.607]  Well, I said nothing.
[00:12:58.607 --> 00:13:01.150]  I'm a big supporter of his constitutional ideas.
[00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:07.317]  But I said, if you endorsed him, if the mainstream media endorsed him, that would hurt him.
[00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:09.558]  I said you guys are out of bullets.
[00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:13.020]  No one buys into or supports what you're doing.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.923]  You have lost the war for the hearts and minds because people don't trust you anymore.
[00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:21.765]  I want to replay really quick once again what Secretary of Clinton said.
[00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:24.827]  She's very clear about who is winning this war.
[00:13:24.827 --> 00:13:27.328]  Take a listen.
[00:13:27.328 --> 00:13:28.429]  Al Jazeera is winning.
[00:13:29.562 --> 00:13:35.749]  The Chinese have opened up a global English language and multi-language television network.
[00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:39.153]  The Russians have opened up an English language network.
[00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:42.417]  I've seen it in a few countries and it's quite instructive.
[00:13:43.379 --> 00:13:44.259]  All right, but let's be honest.
[00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:46.560]  This is not to pat us on the back.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.282]  This is more to drum up support on why she says the State Department needs more.
[00:13:51.282 --> 00:14:00.385]  Now, since she's watching, Alex, or we hope she is, I'd like to hear your advice to Secretary of Clinton, both on what the message should be and how to better get it out there.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:10.003]  Well, again, the people that have hijacked the United States in the last five decades, to be conservative, do not speak for the people of America.
[00:14:10.003 --> 00:14:21.887]  And America has become the demon of the world, instead of being the apple of the world's eye, because the world has realized that we now predominantly have become an engine of evil.
[00:14:21.887 --> 00:14:26.888]  And you're right to say that all Hillary is doing is hitting the panic button and saying, give us more funding.
[00:14:26.888 --> 00:14:28.089]  I mean, it came out years ago.
[00:14:28.689 --> 00:14:28.849]  That's
[00:14:46.235 --> 00:14:47.416]  Stop lying.
[00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.177]  Stop engaging in disinformation.
[00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:50.858]  Stop attacking freedom.
[00:14:50.858 --> 00:14:53.200]  Stop attacking other sovereign nations.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.441]  Stop being propaganda.
[00:14:54.441 --> 00:14:58.764]  Stop being modern Joseph Goebbels, Nazi propaganda ministers.
[00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:03.487]  And people might start thinking of you as trustworthy sources.
[00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:10.852]  You guys used the public faith and abused it to the point of, if you even tell the truth, no one believes you.
[00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:12.093]  I mean, if the U.S.
[00:15:12.093 --> 00:15:15.456]  government-controlled media tells the public the sky is blue,
[00:15:15.996 --> 00:15:17.516]  They think it's red.
[00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:19.777]  If they tell people something's up, folks think it's down.
[00:15:19.777 --> 00:15:21.117]  If it's black, it's white.
[00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:25.998]  No one believes this Orwellian propaganda system anymore.
[00:15:25.998 --> 00:15:34.481]  Okay, folks, so there was just a snippet of the 15 minutes I did on Russia Today last night, transmitted all over the world.
[00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:39.162]  And that doesn't mean that other foreign-controlled media is completely trustworthy either.
[00:15:39.162 --> 00:15:39.642]  We have to
[00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:47.525]  study it all and basically sort through it ourselves but how many times has this so-called
[00:15:48.686 --> 00:15:49.847]  Government lied to us.
[00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:58.173]  How many times has this so-called government-controlled media been caught trying to divide and conquer the population?
[00:15:58.173 --> 00:16:02.637]  Okay, let me get into some economic news, then I'm gonna get into the TSA, and then we're gonna open the phones up.
[00:16:02.637 --> 00:16:06.800]  In fact, the phones are open right now on this live Friday edition.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.901]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:16:07.901 --> 00:16:08.041]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:10.062]  You're welcome to call in on any subject, any item, but
[00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:22.630]  Have your question or comment quickly, because I'm long-winded and we'll never get to the next person.
[00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.971]  So please have your points ready, and when I go to you, you're gonna be on air.
[00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.071]  People are always like, am I on air?
[00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:27.591]  Am I on air?
[00:16:27.591 --> 00:16:28.532]  Yes, you're on air.
[00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:31.913]  Please have your radios off, because I want people to be able to hear you too.
[00:16:31.913 --> 00:16:31.953]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:39.384]  Now, here is the BBC.
[00:16:39.384 --> 00:16:43.128]  Oil prices rise as Libyan tensions grow.
[00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:52.197]  It's continuing and oil rose by more than a dollar as fighting in Libya intensified amid reports of protests in Saudi Arabia, oil productions, Eastern region.
[00:16:52.197 --> 00:16:54.459]  It's up for April delivery.
[00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:55.300]  This is what's important.
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.342]  The futures are way up to $115.93 a barrel.
[00:17:01.225 --> 00:17:04.686]  Oil wealth must be shared by citizens, says Soros.
[00:17:04.686 --> 00:17:09.948]  He means he wants international groups to control it all, so he gets to share it with himself.
[00:17:09.948 --> 00:17:14.530]  He's going to take good care of you when he's not busy trying to bankrupt countries by design.
[00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.711]  I mean, what a sick joke, watching him masquerade around like some kind of humanitarian.
[00:17:19.711 --> 00:17:23.873]  Continuing with the North African situation, Gaddafi, army shells,
[00:17:25.093 --> 00:17:26.834]  Okay, continuing here.
[00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:54.374]  U.S.
[00:17:54.374 --> 00:18:08.460]  Libyan policy zero legitimacy and this is an article at PrisonPlanet.com breaking down what a fraud it is and how they are trying to gear up to at least back the rebels militarily if not invade the country.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:14.262]  So that's just some of the news that we have on that front continuing.
[00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:34.195]  With this information, on the economic front, I do want to hear from listeners about the big story we covered yesterday, that a whole gaggle of big, marquee, mainstream media sources are now heralding that the death of the dollar is nigh.
[00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:35.816]  The death of the dollar is the world reserve currency.
[00:18:35.816 --> 00:18:36.956]  You'll still have dollars.
[00:18:36.956 --> 00:18:44.539]  They'll just be based, basically, and controlled by the private central banking cartel via the IMF World Bank under SDR.
[00:18:47.234 --> 00:19:08.561]  Rubrics, but it says why the dollars rain is near an end and it goes on to report the single most astonishing fact about foreign exchange is not high volume of transactions as incredible as the growth has been nor is it the voluntary of currency rates or the volatility of currency rates as wild as the markets are these days.
[00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:11.962]  Instead it's the extent to which the market remains dollar centric.
[00:19:12.739 --> 00:19:23.204]  And then they go through the fact that the world is moving away from the dollar, and that the end of the dollar is a foregone conclusion, and that that's natural, and that that's basically a good thing.
[00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:31.108]  This is tyranny designed from within our own government to basically bankrupt us as vassals of the globalists.
[00:19:31.108 --> 00:19:40.052]  And we've laid this out for more than a decade, what was coming, and we're now approaching it, and the media is acting like the end of the dollar hegemony is actually a good thing.
[00:19:40.652 --> 00:19:47.558]  When it is going to be a economic Armageddon when it finally implodes.
[00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:49.020]  So we'll talk more about that.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.506]  Your phone calls the latest on the federal takeover of America via the TSA rolling out on the streets.
[00:19:55.506 --> 00:19:58.028]  Forbes and others are now finally telling the truth about the situation.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.741]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:04.022]  No kidding!
[00:20:04.022 --> 00:20:08.405]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[00:20:08.405 --> 00:20:11.167]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:14.629]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[00:20:14.629 --> 00:20:19.652]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:23.174]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic.
[00:20:23.434 --> 00:20:23.734]  I think so.
[00:20:47.031 --> 00:20:52.994]  Call 877-747-2793 or go to ReusableCanningLids.com.
[00:20:52.994 --> 00:20:57.697]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids, the original since 1976.
[00:21:07.654 --> 00:21:12.695]  To the very foundations of our nation, we've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:12.695 --> 00:21:16.376]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.376 --> 00:21:17.176]  Have you?
[00:21:17.176 --> 00:21:28.478]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market, yet it could change everything about your normal way of life, the way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your family.
[00:21:28.478 --> 00:21:29.658]  Could this really happen?
[00:21:29.658 --> 00:21:33.659]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:21:33.659 --> 00:21:35.599]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM.
[00:21:42.073 --> 00:21:42.473]  I'm good.
[00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:07.859]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:22:29.893 --> 00:22:31.154]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:31.154 --> 00:22:35.717]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.717 --> 00:22:41.521]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.521 --> 00:22:45.163]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:47.885]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:47.885 --> 00:22:52.948]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:20.468]  Coming up later in the hour, I'm going to get into the huge new TSA developments as the public completely turns against them and the admission that this is a federal power grab takeover by nothing more than modern brown shirts.
[00:24:20.468 --> 00:24:22.569]  I'm not saying every TSA person is bad individually.
[00:24:22.569 --> 00:24:26.029]  A lot of them ask for an autograph or shake my hand wherever I fly.
[00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:31.311]  But a lot of them are sociopath control freaks who enjoy the illegitimate power they've been given.
[00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:35.554]  I want to get more into the economy, more into what's happening in Libya.
[00:24:35.554 --> 00:24:42.600]  But so we actually get to some of your phone calls, which I always enjoy hearing from you and the different questions and directions you take us in.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.601]  I'm going to go ahead and go to your phone calls now.
[00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:47.904]  But in the next segment, I'm going to make a very important announcement.
[00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:53.449]  So please stay with us for that at the start of the next segment coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:24:53.449 --> 00:24:55.731]  Let's talk to Scott in Mass.
[00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:56.631]  You're on the air, Scott.
[00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:57.172]  Thanks for holding.
[00:24:57.691 --> 00:24:58.491]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:24:58.491 --> 00:24:59.131]  How are you?
[00:24:59.131 --> 00:24:59.651]  I'm okay.
[00:24:59.651 --> 00:25:01.012]  Pretty tired, but okay.
[00:25:01.012 --> 00:25:04.693]  I'd like to say that we're in a depression.
[00:25:04.693 --> 00:25:06.933]  Our economy is crumbling.
[00:25:06.933 --> 00:25:17.736]  Look, Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, the Rothschilds, and other greedy and evil international Jewish bankers on Wall Street have destroyed our economy, Mr. Jones.
[00:25:17.736 --> 00:25:25.298]  And not only have they destroyed our economy, but the Federal Reserve Bank was founded by Paul Warburg, which is a Jewish invention.
[00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:33.305]  And that doesn't even include the wars that are raging in Iraq and Afghanistan, which I blame on the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.
[00:25:33.305 --> 00:25:37.167]  We were attacked, by the way, on 9-11 because of the over $10 billion the U.S.
[00:25:37.167 --> 00:25:40.248]  gives to Israel annually in military and economic aid.
[00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:45.091]  Okay, Scott, Scott, let me say something here, okay?
[00:25:45.091 --> 00:25:46.632]  Because we don't screen your calls.
[00:25:46.632 --> 00:25:49.433]  Did we screen your call?
[00:25:49.433 --> 00:25:49.993]  Say that again?
[00:25:49.993 --> 00:25:50.934]  Did we screen your call?
[00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.889]  No.
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.401]  I am against the corruption of the British government.
[00:26:11.401 --> 00:26:13.903]  I'm against the corrupt things that the Israeli government does.
[00:26:13.903 --> 00:26:17.284]  I'm against the corrupt things that the Chinese government does.
[00:26:17.284 --> 00:26:32.793]  And I criticize Israel on a routine basis, but to... And I heard these calls a few days ago when I had a stomach bug and had to go off air, and Watson was filling in, and I heard people calling in saying this, and I know it's wrong
[00:26:33.413 --> 00:26:39.936]  to go with the age-old idea that all evil on earth flows from Jews.
[00:26:39.936 --> 00:26:42.858]  Now, are there corrupt, you know, evil bankers that are Jewish?
[00:26:42.858 --> 00:26:47.240]  Are there corrupt people pushing culture-destroying things that happen to be Jewish in Hollywood?
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.583]  Yes, but to sit there and then say that
[00:26:52.603 --> 00:26:57.246]  That all the ills in the world are caused by Jews is wrong.
[00:26:57.246 --> 00:27:03.391]  Jews are a very diverse, wide group of people who have a lot of different political ideas.
[00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:09.395]  And every time I talk about the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, people then say, well, the Rockefellers are Jewish too.
[00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:10.755]  Not true.
[00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:12.476]  The Rothschilds, certainly they are.
[00:27:12.476 --> 00:27:19.097]  But when I talk about the Queen of England being corrupt and being ultra-wealthy, she suspended the Parliament two years ago, twice, in Canada.
[00:27:19.097 --> 00:27:21.518]  She runs 20-plus commonwealths.
[00:27:21.518 --> 00:27:35.180]  When I talk about Queen Beatrix, who's super high-powered and at the heart of the world government, and more wealthy than the Rockefellers, people say, quit covering up for Israel just because I cover all the big corrupt forces that are out there.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.161]  I mean, are you saying, sir, that every
[00:27:38.062 --> 00:27:42.933]  Evil in the New World Order is flowing out of Jews.
[00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.952]  You know, I never get what forgery means.
[00:27:45.952 --> 00:27:47.693]  I mean, why do people say forgery?
[00:27:47.693 --> 00:27:48.513]  You mean it would be a fake?
[00:28:08.224 --> 00:28:14.414]  Uh, or it would be a frame-up, but a forgery just means that you copied a signature or something.
[00:28:14.414 --> 00:28:15.496]  I don't even get what that means.
[00:28:22.737 --> 00:28:27.584]  Well, I mean, it's written like a comic book.
[00:28:27.584 --> 00:28:31.110]  I mean, why would anybody write something down like that?
[00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:53.005]  He made the protocol famous, and in The International Jew, he pretty much rehashes what the protocol said, that the Jews control world finance, the media, now they control the US foreign policy.
[00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:57.409]  The Jews, Mr. Jones, have inflicted tremendous harm upon the United States.
[00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:58.210]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.793]  From your perspective, should the Jews be gotten rid of?
[00:29:01.793 --> 00:29:02.914]  Yes, they should.
[00:29:02.914 --> 00:29:04.615]  In every country... Alright, I'm going to stop you right there.
[00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:05.496]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[00:29:06.708 --> 00:29:08.230]  I am Jewish.
[00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:11.072]  Now, I'm not, but I would talk like that.
[00:29:11.072 --> 00:29:14.376]  You want to kill the Jews, you're going to have to kill me, okay?
[00:29:14.376 --> 00:29:21.322]  And, you know, the big secret comes from me on air, but nobody ever wants to say that because it makes it sweeter and more fun.
[00:29:21.322 --> 00:29:23.744]  My wife's grandfather was Jewish.
[00:29:23.744 --> 00:29:24.785]  Now, my wife's a Christian.
[00:29:25.746 --> 00:29:28.608]  And my family are Christians, but it doesn't matter.
[00:29:28.608 --> 00:29:35.993]  If you say that because my wife has some Jewish ancestry that she's evil and needs to be killed, then you're gonna have to go through me.
[00:29:35.993 --> 00:29:36.293]  Okay?
[00:29:36.293 --> 00:29:45.739]  And if you say that the Hispanics were the devil and have to be killed, or black people are the devil, a lot of people say that need to be killed, or white people are the devil, like some black groups say, you gotta go through me.
[00:29:45.739 --> 00:29:46.040]  Okay?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.842]  I mean, you just said you want to murder millions of people.
[00:29:48.842 --> 00:29:49.262]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:50.543 --> 00:29:54.470]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.285 --> 00:30:04.446]  You're subject to other police action.
[00:30:04.446 --> 00:30:05.707]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:05.707 --> 00:30:09.329]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.329 --> 00:30:11.871]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:11.871 --> 00:30:17.734]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:23.978]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.398 --> 00:30:30.360]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.541]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:38.842]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:38.842 --> 00:30:44.784]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:44.784 --> 00:30:48.345]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:50.326]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:50.766]  It's here.

[00:31:53.545 --> 00:31:54.005]  Thank you!
[00:31:59.755 --> 00:32:04.298]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.298 --> 00:32:05.219]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.219 --> 00:32:08.641]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.641 --> 00:32:09.502]  Number 2.
[00:32:09.502 --> 00:32:14.405]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:15.145]  It's true.
[00:32:15.145 --> 00:32:20.009]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:20.849]  Number 3.
[00:32:20.849 --> 00:32:24.431]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:28.134]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.334 --> 00:32:29.114]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:31.875]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.875 --> 00:32:35.557]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.557 --> 00:32:36.357]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.357 --> 00:32:40.499]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:45.561]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.561 --> 00:32:49.722]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.722 --> 00:32:51.523]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.523 --> 00:32:56.125]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:32:56.505 --> 00:33:10.570]  Okay, I want to finish up with what Scott was talking about.
[00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:16.913]  Then I want to make an announcement that we're going to Eric, Mark, David, Moses, Julio, and others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:18.835 --> 00:33:25.899]  It is the height of madness to believe that one group of people are responsible for all the evils in the world.
[00:33:25.899 --> 00:33:38.245]  There was incredible enslavement and torture and murder going on in China 3,000 years ago, thousands of years before any Jews or Jesuits or anybody else showed up in what's China today.
[00:33:39.264 --> 00:33:50.030]  There was incredible murder and degradation going on with the Aztecs, with the Babylonians, with the Druids and Celts.
[00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:59.054]  Every culture basically gets corruption in place and people on power trips and the priest classed and does the same type of stuff.
[00:33:59.054 --> 00:34:02.416]  There's been money manipulation going on.
[00:34:02.416 --> 00:34:06.618]  Did Jesus whip the money changers in the temple for currency manipulation?
[00:34:06.618 --> 00:34:06.879]  Yes.
[00:34:08.499 --> 00:34:10.540]  Do you go back to the goldsmiths of Europe?
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.501]  A lot of them being Jewish?
[00:34:11.501 --> 00:34:12.261]  Yes.
[00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:27.227]  But when you sit there and say, Jews are the source of all evil, and then just broadly paint an entire group of people, at a primitive level, that is very alluring to just say, there's the problem, that's the problem, that's everything.
[00:34:27.227 --> 00:34:35.030]  And then you call in and you say that, I guess like in Germany, if you had 1% Jewish blood, you had to be killed.
[00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.831]  And I love how these Nazis
[00:34:37.944 --> 00:34:45.852]  Always say Hitler didn't kill Jews and didn't target them when I've read Hitler's writings and listened to his radio broadcast where he talked about it.
[00:34:45.852 --> 00:34:49.837]  And then you say kill him and Hitler didn't finish the job.
[00:34:49.837 --> 00:34:51.398]  I mean, I see this stuff everywhere.
[00:34:51.398 --> 00:34:53.881]  And then you say, oh, but Hitler didn't kill people.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:25.520]  I mean you're saying kill all the Jews and you have chosen to say that my wife is Jewish and that when she's a Christian and and and is proud of her I guess 25% or what would it be if it was a grandfather Jewish blood she's proud of her other you know Irish and Scottish and English blood just like I'm a little bit Native American if you don't like Native Americans should that mean they should all be killed or I should be killed so let's just get this straight if you hate black people I'm black okay I'm black
[00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.162]  Okay?
[00:35:28.162 --> 00:35:29.463]  I'm an African-American.
[00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:30.284]  Alright?
[00:35:30.284 --> 00:35:32.826]  If you don't like Hispanics, I'm Hispanic.
[00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:33.107]  Okay?
[00:35:33.107 --> 00:35:34.588]  I'm from Spain.
[00:35:34.588 --> 00:35:35.669]  I'm not.
[00:35:35.669 --> 00:35:37.911]  I'd be proud if I had any of that blood.
[00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:38.291]  Fine.
[00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.292]  You don't like Portuguese?
[00:35:39.292 --> 00:35:40.173]  I'm Portuguese.
[00:35:40.173 --> 00:35:41.234]  You don't like Chinese?
[00:35:41.234 --> 00:35:42.034]  I'm Chinese.
[00:35:42.034 --> 00:35:43.035]  You don't like Koreans?
[00:35:43.035 --> 00:35:44.136]  I'm Koreans.
[00:35:44.136 --> 00:35:45.177]  You don't like Jews?
[00:35:45.177 --> 00:35:45.678]  I'm Jewish.
[00:35:45.678 --> 00:35:46.278]  Okay?
[00:35:46.278 --> 00:35:47.139]  I'm Jewish.
[00:35:47.139 --> 00:35:47.859]  You understand that?
[00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:48.380]  I'm Jewish.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:48.960]  Okay?
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.221]  Good.
[00:35:49.221 --> 00:35:49.921]  There you go.
[00:35:49.921 --> 00:35:50.182]  Alright?
[00:35:50.842 --> 00:36:05.805]  I mean literally a guy calls in to my show and says all the Jews should be killed and these guys run around saying my wife is Jewish and all this baloney and that I work for Israel and all this mentally ill garbage when I'm critical of Israel and don't like Israel's globalist agenda.
[00:36:05.805 --> 00:36:17.827]  And I had Kaiser on just a few days ago talking about how the Israeli lobby clearly lobbied to shut down the offshore accounts in Switzerland so they could move them to Israel.
[00:36:18.675 --> 00:36:20.556]  Or I make films about Israel and the U.S.
[00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:22.317]  government together targeting the U.S.'
[00:36:22.277 --> 00:36:22.918]  's liberty.
[00:36:22.918 --> 00:36:24.579]  Makes the Nazis even matter.
[00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:26.540]  Because they're all about being a cult.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.081]  All they do is fight with each other.
[00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:30.063]  They're filled with feds.
[00:36:30.063 --> 00:36:33.465]  And all they do is say, we're the best, we're good.
[00:36:33.465 --> 00:36:39.009]  We morally can just say everybody, you know, is a devilish, evil Jew.
[00:36:39.009 --> 00:36:41.510]  And we're good intellectually.
[00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.891]  We don't make films.
[00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:44.532]  We don't do quality radio programs.
[00:36:44.532 --> 00:36:45.973]  We don't get anything done.
[00:36:45.973 --> 00:36:48.575]  We just sit around saying, we're the best, we're the best, we're the best.
[00:36:48.595 --> 00:36:48.715]  Yes.
[00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:16.343]  Okay, well, I'm white!
[00:37:16.343 --> 00:37:17.824]  I mean, that's really what I am.
[00:37:17.824 --> 00:37:21.925]  My true identity is a Protestant, Anglo-Saxon, Christian.
[00:37:21.925 --> 00:37:22.965]  My name's Jones.
[00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:23.705]  I'm Welsh.
[00:37:23.705 --> 00:37:24.705]  I'm German.
[00:37:24.705 --> 00:37:28.866]  Almost my entire mother's family on both sides are German and British.
[00:37:28.866 --> 00:37:30.047]  I'm proud of all that.
[00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.007]  My culture's not bad.
[00:37:32.014 --> 00:37:34.298]  But your culture of your black's not bad.
[00:37:34.298 --> 00:37:44.157]  But you know, I've gotten the calls from Jamaica and places particularly on air, you know, telling me that I'm the devil because I'm European.
[00:37:44.972 --> 00:37:45.312]  Okay?
[00:37:45.312 --> 00:37:47.173]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:37:47.173 --> 00:37:50.676]  So, wipe out all the Europeans and all our problems will be solved.
[00:37:50.676 --> 00:37:53.017]  Wipe out all the Jews, all our problems will be solved.
[00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:55.639]  Wipe out all the Chinese, all our problems are going to be solved.
[00:37:55.639 --> 00:38:03.004]  And every culture who's had wars with each other kind of has these historical legends about their enemy.
[00:38:03.004 --> 00:38:09.148]  The Japanese hate the Chinese and have all these stories about how they're subhuman and the source of all evil.
[00:38:09.668 --> 00:38:12.569]  The Chinese have the same stories about the Japanese.
[00:38:12.569 --> 00:38:15.011]  The Arabs have the stories about the Jews.
[00:38:15.011 --> 00:38:17.332]  The Jews have the stories about them.
[00:38:17.332 --> 00:38:26.056]  I get on air and criticize the fact that there are race laws in Israel that they will arrest an Arab or someone else if they marry a Jewish woman.
[00:38:26.897 --> 00:38:29.220]  I criticize that racism.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.824]  I get criticized by the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:38:31.824 --> 00:38:38.012]  But I do it from a truthful, loving, real, rational perspective.
[00:38:38.012 --> 00:38:38.593]  Okay?
[00:38:38.593 --> 00:38:42.278]  Just like I criticize the corruption of the Chinese government and the organ harvesting.
[00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:44.461]  I'm not saying Chinese or Asians are bad.
[00:38:45.515 --> 00:39:00.428]  And so it's very, very frustrating for me to hear a phone call like that, and someone really calls in and declares war, and says, you know, if your wife has any Jewish blood, that she needs to die.
[00:39:00.428 --> 00:39:02.530]  I mean, think about the magnitude!
[00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:08.495]  I mean, you almost make people choose a side, but I'm not gonna do that.
[00:39:08.495 --> 00:39:12.658]  You've made up your mind and you've made it that I'm this Israeli agent when it's completely
[00:39:13.539 --> 00:39:19.403]  The opposite of the facts or the crazy people that say I'm a Vatican, you know, warlock assassin.
[00:39:19.403 --> 00:39:20.743]  That's why Charlie made that joke.
[00:39:20.743 --> 00:39:24.506]  We spent hours one time watching videos of people saying that about us.
[00:39:24.506 --> 00:39:26.807]  That's a joke.
[00:39:26.807 --> 00:39:30.029]  You know, now the warlock group said they're going to do a spell on Charlie Saturday.
[00:39:30.029 --> 00:39:31.670]  It's in the Salem News.
[00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.571]  It's fruitcake-ism.
[00:39:33.274 --> 00:39:33.994]  You know?
[00:39:33.994 --> 00:39:35.435]  Look, I'm not a Vatican assassin.
[00:39:35.435 --> 00:39:36.176]  I'm not a ninja.
[00:39:36.176 --> 00:39:37.016]  I'm not a warlock.
[00:39:37.016 --> 00:39:38.117]  It's a joke.
[00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:42.780]  But see, we take those insults on and say, okay, if you're going to say that about us, fine.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.480]  Believe whatever you want.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.482]  Do you understand that?
[00:39:46.482 --> 00:39:47.502]  I am who I am.
[00:39:47.502 --> 00:39:49.003]  I care about free market.
[00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:50.564]  I care about private property rights.
[00:39:50.564 --> 00:39:52.165]  I care about family.
[00:39:52.165 --> 00:40:01.570]  I don't want Mexican children, British children, Jewish children, Russian children, Japanese children to be aborted.
[00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.371]  African children.
[00:40:03.826 --> 00:40:16.041]  Okay, it doesn't matter how many black groups, and every time I'm up in New York, a lot of black folks come up and shake my hand because they know who I am, but a lot of people who I see who are black, you know, they have got such, many of them, a hatred of white people.
[00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:19.725]  You can just see it, and you can see the hate going on.
[00:40:20.786 --> 00:40:25.711]  And so, look, it's the political system we need to change.
[00:40:25.711 --> 00:40:31.316]  We need to get a Bill of Rights and Constitution culture back in place so we all have liberty and freedom.
[00:40:31.316 --> 00:40:34.879]  Get rid of the Federal Reserve, regardless of who runs it.
[00:40:34.879 --> 00:40:36.401]  Okay?
[00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:37.922]  Restore the Republic.
[00:40:37.922 --> 00:40:40.164]  That's the system that protects us all.
[00:40:40.164 --> 00:40:41.065]  I mean, are there corrupt
[00:40:42.686 --> 00:40:44.046]  I mean, take George Soros.
[00:40:44.046 --> 00:40:45.667]  There's a 60 Minutes piece from him.
[00:40:45.667 --> 00:40:47.227]  It's got to be 15 years ago.
[00:40:47.227 --> 00:40:48.727]  It's in the mid-90s.
[00:40:48.727 --> 00:41:03.391]  You can just pull up George Soros on 60 Minutes, and he admits that he helped the Nazis go around in Europe and take the property from Jews, which was then basically fenced out.
[00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:04.631]  I mean, this is a guy helping
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.460]  Go after Jews.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.701]  And you say, well look, George Soros is a Jew.
[00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:11.121]  Look, all the Jews are evil.
[00:41:11.121 --> 00:41:12.002]  What?
[00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:16.963]  I mean, that'd be like saying Jeffrey Dahmer was white.
[00:41:16.963 --> 00:41:20.744]  I don't know what his family crest would be, what the background of Dahmer is.
[00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.005]  Is Dahmer German?
[00:41:22.005 --> 00:41:23.845]  Google family crest Dahmer.
[00:41:23.845 --> 00:41:25.466]  Dahmer family crest.
[00:41:25.466 --> 00:41:31.928]  I mean, does that mean that everybody who's German or Dutch needs to be killed?
[00:41:31.928 --> 00:41:35.269]  I mean, it's just mindless, idiotic tribalism.
[00:41:37.248 --> 00:41:38.251]  I am who I am.
[00:41:38.251 --> 00:41:40.618]  I am a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
[00:41:41.704 --> 00:41:44.085]  And that's what my family's been on both sides.
[00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:44.926]  Famously.
[00:41:44.926 --> 00:41:47.948]  Back to the Mayflower and right through to today.
[00:41:47.948 --> 00:41:49.489]  And that's my identity.
[00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:51.230]  And that's my family's identity.
[00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:52.790]  And that's my wife's identity.
[00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.932]  But if you want to say that's not our identity, fine.
[00:41:54.932 --> 00:41:56.453]  Whatever you think it is.
[00:41:56.453 --> 00:41:57.453]  White devil.
[00:41:57.453 --> 00:41:58.494]  Jewish agent.
[00:41:58.494 --> 00:41:59.935]  Vatican agent.
[00:41:59.935 --> 00:42:02.156]  Masonic agent.
[00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:03.417]  Reptoid agent.
[00:42:03.417 --> 00:42:06.238]  Whatever it is you want to say about me, fine.
[00:42:06.238 --> 00:42:07.399]  I don't care.
[00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:08.840]  That's your loss.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:17.626]  That's your loss for being petty-minded, and that's why you're so unsuccessful in life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:17.626 --> 00:42:26.232]  And when you sit there and say, wipe out all the Jews, there's so many Zionist documents that are public where they admit, oh, this is great.
[00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:35.619]  Jews will be persecuted, and then basically the Jewish mafia can sit on top of them and suck off of them and get donations from them and use them for their own power.
[00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:42.492]  How do you think the Italian Mafia operated when the Italians couldn't get justice, couldn't get law through the courts because they were being discriminated against?
[00:42:42.492 --> 00:42:43.832]  Or the Irish Mafia?
[00:42:43.832 --> 00:42:46.413]  That's how these mafias develop.
[00:42:46.413 --> 00:42:49.834]  And so we have spoken out against the Jewish Mafia, that's what it is.
[00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:54.236]  We've spoken out against the American-Israeli Affairs Committee, AIPAC.
[00:42:54.236 --> 00:42:57.777]  We have done countless shows, and I almost back off from doing it.
[00:42:59.252 --> 00:43:10.604]  Because as I've learned more over the years, and as I have exposed Israel for corruption and bad things they're doing, and being right there in the middle of it, it actually makes the Nazis attack me more.
[00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:13.670]  They don't want that.
[00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.530]  They're not being real.
[00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:16.711]  And they'll say, well, we're not Nazis.
[00:43:16.711 --> 00:43:17.851]  We only want to kill the Jews.
[00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:19.612]  Whatever you want to call yourselves.
[00:43:19.612 --> 00:43:22.493]  It's despicable and it's crazy.
[00:43:22.493 --> 00:43:23.933]  And it's wrong.
[00:43:23.933 --> 00:43:32.516]  OK, so I said I'd take a lot of calls, but that one caller just absolutely had to be responded to because it's just nuts.
[00:43:32.516 --> 00:43:39.399]  I mean, it's totally and completely nuts that you can't just criticize corrupt individuals that are doing things.
[00:43:39.399 --> 00:43:40.239]  You have to make it
[00:43:41.371 --> 00:43:43.555]  About entire groups of people.
[00:43:43.555 --> 00:43:45.278]  And I, for one, am tired of it.
[00:43:45.278 --> 00:43:53.591]  I'm tired of people making fun of folks that wear cowboy hats and got a suntan and a red neck because they work outside all day and bust their hind end.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:56.461]  I'm tired of it, but people like it.
[00:43:56.461 --> 00:44:04.004]  People like to pick groups out, and I'm so tired of TV always making fun of Southerners, making fun of people in Texas, making fun of people.
[00:44:04.004 --> 00:44:10.007]  I'm just sick of it, but it's what people like because it makes them feel good about themselves.
[00:44:10.007 --> 00:44:17.851]  You know, Alex Jones reaching tens of millions of people a month, Alex Jones trailblazing the awakening against the globalists, and there's all these armchair quarterbacks and people with
[00:44:19.181 --> 00:44:24.867]  You know, podcasts with 15 listeners who can just sit back and go, forget all his work, everything.
[00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:28.130]  I'm better than him because I can make up lies about him.
[00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.171]  Well, good for you!
[00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:30.972]  I know who I am.
[00:44:30.972 --> 00:44:32.734]  I'm proud of who I am.
[00:44:32.734 --> 00:44:33.455]  Okay?
[00:44:33.455 --> 00:44:39.401]  And quite frankly, the lies and the attacks and the disinformation, that helps me wake up every morning when I'm tired.
[00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:41.642]  You know how stomach bugs work.
[00:44:41.642 --> 00:44:46.143]  First one child gets it, then your wife gets it, then the other two children get it, then you get it.
[00:44:46.143 --> 00:44:50.705]  I was up a lot last night, you know, with children sick and everything else.
[00:44:50.705 --> 00:44:51.665]  I didn't want to come in today.
[00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:53.325]  I've got bloodshot eyes.
[00:44:53.325 --> 00:44:57.167]  But I came in here because I've got issues and things to talk about.
[00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:57.467]  Okay?
[00:44:57.467 --> 00:44:59.487]  I've got important things to discuss.
[00:44:59.487 --> 00:45:01.908]  You know, I'm fighting the TSA, the federal takeover.
[00:45:01.908 --> 00:45:03.889]  We can do it successfully together.
[00:45:05.435 --> 00:45:08.096]  We're fighting to not have the dollar devalued.
[00:45:08.096 --> 00:45:11.657]  We're fighting to keep property rights in place in the Second Amendment.
[00:45:11.657 --> 00:45:16.059]  And people just insert, yeah, but the Jews all need to be killed.
[00:45:16.059 --> 00:45:17.239]  What?
[00:45:17.239 --> 00:45:18.279]  What?
[00:45:18.279 --> 00:45:22.621]  And you're so warped and you're thinking you think that's normal.
[00:45:22.621 --> 00:45:28.443]  You think you call in and talk about mass murder and that you're some moral, wonderful person.
[00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:35.716]  There's a reason the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL and others call me the number one enemy.
[00:45:35.716 --> 00:45:44.282]  Because I'm effective, and I'm real, and I'm cogent, and I'm on point, and I reach people with common sense and logic.
[00:45:44.282 --> 00:45:47.724]  And why is the TSA such a great issue to fight the globalists on?
[00:45:47.724 --> 00:45:50.306]  Well, it's key for them to take over society in the Tenth Amendment.
[00:45:50.306 --> 00:45:52.928]  It's their federal occupation rollout under FEMA.
[00:45:54.403 --> 00:46:03.926]  And DHS, but also it's something whether you're left or right, conservative, libertarian, Muslim, Christian, Jewish, atheist, nobody likes it.
[00:46:03.926 --> 00:46:05.967]  Almost no one likes it.
[00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:10.888]  And this big myth that we were going to go along with it so they could break our will is falling.
[00:46:10.888 --> 00:46:13.129]  And so we're coming together.
[00:46:13.129 --> 00:46:15.149]  That's what the globalists don't want.
[00:46:15.149 --> 00:46:16.830]  Come together around ideas.
[00:46:18.706 --> 00:46:22.089]  I don't care if you're white, Hispanic, Jewish, doesn't matter to me.
[00:46:22.089 --> 00:46:24.091]  It's what's in your mind.
[00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:33.179]  And if you're running around waving Mexican flags and so upset by American flags, you make, you know, the school teachers send kids home who are wearing American flags on their shirts, an old Navy shirt.
[00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:34.260]  That's crazy.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.404]  It's not that I dislike the hordes of immigrants that are here because of their skin color.
[00:46:39.224 --> 00:46:43.668]  I dislike him because I know most of them have been taught in Mexico that this country's bad.
[00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:48.331]  And I know they vote over 90% to take my guns and take my private property.
[00:46:48.331 --> 00:46:51.474]  They've made themselves the enemy because of what's in their mind.
[00:46:51.474 --> 00:46:54.496]  I'm trying to reach out to those people.
[00:46:54.496 --> 00:46:55.457]  I want us to win.
[00:46:55.457 --> 00:46:56.798]  I want us to go to the stars.
[00:46:56.798 --> 00:46:59.180]  I want us to be successful.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:03.804]  I don't dislike some black supremacist because he's black.
[00:47:03.804 --> 00:47:08.408]  I dislike him because he's saying he wants to kill me and my family and is making me his enemy.
[00:47:09.346 --> 00:47:12.187]  When I don't want to be his enemy.
[00:47:12.187 --> 00:47:22.371]  That's why I have black activists on this show that are actually doing something about the fact that 52 percent, I was wrong saying 51, 52 percent of blacks are never born in this country.
[00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:25.232]  Where's your black leaders on that?
[00:47:25.232 --> 00:47:26.953]  Really listen to what we say.
[00:47:26.953 --> 00:47:28.633]  Really listen to what we do.
[00:47:28.633 --> 00:47:30.594]  Search your soul.
[00:47:30.594 --> 00:47:31.875]  Search your discernment.
[00:47:31.875 --> 00:47:32.655]  Okay, here's the big announcement.
[00:47:32.655 --> 00:47:34.035]  I'm going to come back and go to calls.
[00:47:34.035 --> 00:47:36.076]  Mark Dice will be on at 8 after, but I've got to go to some of your calls.
[00:47:39.468 --> 00:47:40.589]  Here's the deal.
[00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:41.869]  Charlie Sheen's my friend.
[00:47:41.869 --> 00:47:47.072]  Charlie Sheen's always been drug-free when I know him, married, upstanding.
[00:47:47.072 --> 00:47:48.653]  You know, not even using profanity.
[00:47:48.653 --> 00:47:50.734]  Very pious, focused.
[00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.316]  He went on this seven-month jag, got wild.
[00:47:53.316 --> 00:47:54.296]  He's off of it now.
[00:47:54.296 --> 00:47:56.717]  Obviously, high on endorphins, being totally clean.
[00:47:56.717 --> 00:47:58.639]  That's a side effect of it.
[00:47:58.639 --> 00:48:01.580]  You know, is really being awake and alive.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.441]  The media calls it mania.
[00:48:03.441 --> 00:48:06.263]  But, you know, I call it being awake and alive and trying to be totally truthful.
[00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:28.637]  But I'm on the jet airplane with him when he came to pick me up three weeks ago, flying out to California, he flew me back to, and I said, you gotta get a Twitter account, instead of just sending stuff through TMZ, you gotta get a Twitter account, you gotta get a Twitter account, and he finally did get a Twitter account, it's almost two million people now in three days, world record, Guinness Book of World Records, and I thought to myself, why am I giving advice, but then not following my own advice?
[00:48:28.637 --> 00:48:33.881]  We've got a Twitter account for, I don't know, six months or so, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones, and
[00:48:36.181 --> 00:48:36.881]  I never promote it.
[00:48:55.248 --> 00:49:02.872]  I send out some Twitters, but I'm going to start sending out a lot of Twitters, and I want to get 100,000 Twitter followers by next Friday.
[00:49:02.872 --> 00:49:05.174]  We got 23,000 without even trying.
[00:49:05.174 --> 00:49:06.554]  We got actually two other accounts.
[00:49:06.554 --> 00:49:08.756]  If you count them all, it's about 60,000 followers.
[00:49:08.756 --> 00:49:13.798]  But we want to focus on this one Twitter account, twitter.com forward slash realalexjones.
[00:49:13.798 --> 00:49:14.999]  Go follow us there.
[00:49:14.999 --> 00:49:16.600]  We'll use this globalist tool against them.
[00:49:18.473 --> 00:49:24.526]  Paul Watson's doing a blurb article on this with the headline, Alex Jones invades Twitter.
[00:49:25.666 --> 00:49:27.467]  And please send it out to everybody.
[00:49:27.467 --> 00:49:28.928]  It'll be up in the next 30 minutes.
[00:49:28.928 --> 00:49:31.330]  Get everybody to join our Twitter account.
[00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.151]  And then you can also post your stuff on there, obviously.
[00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:39.215]  And the WeAreChange material and a symbiotic relationship to use this globalist tool against them.
[00:49:39.215 --> 00:49:44.518]  Google has changed their algorithm twice the last six months, admittedly trying to restrict and block alternative media.
[00:49:44.518 --> 00:49:48.701]  Our growth curve is so fast, they haven't been able to block us, but they have slowed us.
[00:49:49.321 --> 00:49:52.964]  And they admit it's targeting myself, Drugs Report, and others.
[00:49:52.964 --> 00:49:56.266]  So, please, Twitter.com, Real Alex Jones.
[00:49:56.266 --> 00:50:03.512]  We're gonna do a Google search term and test the new Google algorithm that's trying to block us getting number one search terms.
[00:50:03.512 --> 00:50:05.253]  We haven't done this in over a week.
[00:50:05.253 --> 00:50:09.296]  I need you to Google Alex Jones Twitter.
[00:50:09.296 --> 00:50:14.800]  Alex Jones Twitter, A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S-T-W-I-T-T-E-R.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.763]  Three words, Alex Jones Twitter.
[00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:31.074]  Alex Jones Twitter and I want to make that number one to test what Google's doing but also to get more people on our Twitter account because we've dominated InfoWars and Prison Planet.
[00:50:31.074 --> 00:50:36.761]  Number one and number two respectively alternative websites that's even engaged by mainstream media.
[00:50:36.761 --> 00:50:38.122]  We've dominated YouTube with

[00:54:06.713 --> 00:54:10.214]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.214 --> 00:54:11.574]  We are back live.
[00:54:11.574 --> 00:54:12.935]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:54:12.935 --> 00:54:14.035]  Eric in California.
[00:54:14.035 --> 00:54:14.795]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:14.795 --> 00:54:16.736]  Hey, what's up?
[00:54:16.736 --> 00:54:17.636]  Worldwide broadcast.
[00:54:17.636 --> 00:54:18.996]  Welcome.
[00:54:18.996 --> 00:54:21.957]  Yeah, I appreciate all the things that you're doing for everybody.
[00:54:21.957 --> 00:54:25.338]  I've been following you every day, listening to everything.
[00:54:25.757 --> 00:54:27.518]  I just got a couple things about that last caller.
[00:54:27.518 --> 00:54:34.383]  He sounds like Hitler already, like, in the making, but I just think the same way, but... Yeah, but you gotta notice their schizophrenic thinking.
[00:54:34.383 --> 00:54:36.985]  Hitler didn't kill anybody, but we need to kill everybody.
[00:54:36.985 --> 00:54:43.249]  Yeah, but he's actually already thinking the same path, but he's not gonna pull out and really actually do it, but that's still halfway of their plan.
[00:54:43.249 --> 00:54:48.773]  No, no, a lot of these people would start killing whole groups of people if they could, and that's why we got the Second Amendment.
[00:54:49.727 --> 00:54:54.711]  Yeah, but if you, and yeah, that's why I'm going to go buy my gun and I'm going to get legit and get legalized and pass a test.
[00:54:54.711 --> 00:54:57.714]  But I think it's all Hollywood and the elites were doing it in Hollywood.
[00:54:57.714 --> 00:55:01.117]  And Tupac and Michael Jackson and all them talked about it and expressed it in songs.
[00:55:01.117 --> 00:55:03.158]  And ODB and they all got murdered.
[00:55:03.158 --> 00:55:05.460]  Or they got killed, like, like a secret way.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:13.407]  And think about, Charlie, think about, I make music myself, so when you express your music about New World Order and all those things that's going down in public and the government,
[00:55:13.792 --> 00:55:14.392]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:55:14.392 --> 00:55:14.633]  Hey, buddy.
[00:55:14.633 --> 00:55:15.573]  Alex, I'd like to speak very briefly on
[00:55:42.782 --> 00:55:53.426]  God's current and increasing wrath and heartbreak over the effect of the abominable sins which have taken place... Yeah, God is dropping his hammer on America, there's no doubt.
[00:55:53.426 --> 00:55:58.228]  They've taken place in America and then they've been exported to the whole world.
[00:55:58.228 --> 00:56:07.892]  As well as his heartbreak caused by the fact that his true people who are called by his name have not relied on his power and guidance to stand up and defeat evil.
[00:56:07.892 --> 00:56:09.193]  From God's point of view,
[00:56:10.416 --> 00:56:27.630]  Repentance unto Him with a sincere heart for our personal and national sins in public all across this land is all that is left to humanity in America and the whole world to bring Almighty God's power back into our land and our world by what He through His true children
[00:56:28.157 --> 00:56:30.059]  Hey Mr. Jones, it's great to talk to you.
[00:56:30.059 --> 00:56:32.581]  All your information has totally changed my life.
[00:56:32.581 --> 00:56:33.842]  Speaking about Howard Stern yesterday,
[00:56:57.026 --> 00:57:09.451]  You know, I used to listen to him all of, I don't know, five years, whatever, loved it, and when I found out about you, I turned that off, forgot Prison Planet TV membership, and have just been listening the whole time.
[00:57:09.451 --> 00:57:18.974]  Well, that's how God uses wicked people and wicked things that happen and corrupt things that happen to actually drive people to the truth.
[00:57:18.974 --> 00:57:21.795]  God works in mysterious ways.
[00:57:21.795 --> 00:57:23.876]  He does, and all the information that I've got
[00:57:24.434 --> 00:57:27.658]  From your show and all your guests and everyone on there.
[00:57:27.658 --> 00:57:28.679]  It's changed my life.
[00:57:28.679 --> 00:57:35.167]  I mean the way I eat, the water, you know, getting supplies, everything I've done for me and my family.
[00:57:35.167 --> 00:57:36.990]  It's been amazing and I was just wondering if
[00:57:38.010 --> 00:57:43.713]  If I would be able to plug something where Sheriff Richard Mack is going to be speaking, if you don't mind.
[00:57:43.713 --> 00:57:45.013]  Sure, we have Richard Mack on all the time.
[00:57:45.013 --> 00:57:47.955]  People can just go to his website and find all of his engagements.
[00:57:47.955 --> 00:57:53.678]  That's probably the best way with a national show, is just go to sheriffmack.com and I appreciate your call.
[00:57:53.678 --> 00:57:56.839]  Going to break here, I haven't really been plugging sponsors, and I should.
[00:57:56.839 --> 00:57:59.761]  One great sponsor is mysolarbackup.com.
[00:57:59.761 --> 00:58:02.582]  If you've ever lost your power and simply wanted to flip a switch, this is the way to go.
[00:58:02.582 --> 00:58:03.543]  Our listeners just love
[00:58:04.463 --> 00:58:06.905]  This system, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[00:58:06.905 --> 00:58:10.109]  This is a great panel system, control unit and battery system.
[00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:14.353]  You can get a bunch of them and run your whole house or your workshop with one of them or your campsite.
[00:58:15.285 --> 00:58:20.069]  We have a free information package you can call and get at 877-327-0365.
[00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:26.794]  That's 877-327-0365 or mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:28.836]  Check them out today, mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:28.836 --> 00:58:38.083]  I'm going to jam in some more of your phone calls straight ahead, and then we're going to get Mark Dyson at 8 after to talk about his new book, Another Salvo in the Info War.
[00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:43.528]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.528 --> 00:58:44.689]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.408 --> 00:58:50.730]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:54.312]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:58:54.312 --> 00:58:55.453]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:58:55.453 --> 00:59:00.015]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:59:00.015 --> 00:59:05.958]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:08.119]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:59:08.119 --> 00:59:10.801]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:59:11.141 --> 00:59:17.625]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:59:17.625 --> 00:59:19.846]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:59:19.846 --> 00:59:25.190]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:30.473]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:59:30.473 --> 00:59:35.636]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:59:35.836 --> 00:59:39.017]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:59:39.017 --> 00:59:41.918]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:41.918 --> 00:59:42.819]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:59:42.819 --> 00:59:43.719]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:45.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:09.961]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:11.543]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.543 --> 01:00:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.085 --> 01:00:17.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:21.357]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:22.798]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:22.798 --> 01:00:23.258]  Hey, buddy.
[01:00:23.258 --> 01:00:25.139]  Hey, I actually got to see you in Santa Cruz.
[01:00:25.139 --> 01:00:25.819]  Well, thanks for coming out.
[01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:26.679]  What's on your mind today?
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.405]  What's on my mind is, uh, I went to a local, uh, fast food place here.
[01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:01.467]  And they had a kiosk that you can order from.
[01:01:01.467 --> 01:01:04.289]  Like a computer.
[01:01:04.289 --> 01:01:13.235]  And I thought that was, uh... Yeah, they're phasing, they're phasing humans out of the checkout counters everywhere, uh, and it's a mode of control.
[01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:16.537]  It's not a way to lower cost.
[01:01:16.537 --> 01:01:20.320]  Yeah, and it, and it just supports China, cause the, the darn thing's made there, and...
[01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:37.465]  Well you know McDonald's going back years ago now you'll talk to an operator in India to order your food and then basically you got a few people in there with the robotic machines they're putting the microwaved fake food together.
[01:01:37.465 --> 01:01:49.108]  Yes that's right and on another point I wanted to talk about I'm not sure if you're aware of IP version 6 but I believe that's the
[01:01:51.143 --> 01:02:02.151]  Well, they're changing the infrastructure of the Internet to force you to only use their systems that have built-in control hubs in them.
[01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:04.773]  Briefly explain it to people.
[01:02:04.773 --> 01:02:17.943]  IP version 6 basically makes the Internet twice as big as the current infrastructure and makes it so that your local link IP is basically known to the whole Internet.
[01:02:18.638 --> 01:02:22.540]  Rather than having it through a firewall or something like that.
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.040]  Yeah, it's Internet ID.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.443]  And that's mainly so they can start taxing it and tracking you and framing people with Internet surfing habits.
[01:02:30.443 --> 01:02:33.465]  And they use things like WikiLeaks to put it out and claim the government didn't do it.
[01:02:33.465 --> 01:02:34.645]  Great points, Moses.
[01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:36.166]  Julio in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:02:36.166 --> 01:02:36.466]  Welcome.
[01:02:37.532 --> 01:02:39.975]  Alex Jones, lover of freedom, brother in arms.
[01:02:39.975 --> 01:02:41.376]  Good to talk to you as always.
[01:02:41.376 --> 01:02:47.923]  Quickly, three reasons why we're winning and we've already won.
[01:02:47.923 --> 01:02:52.407]  Charlie Sheen has a Twitter account, my favorite band, Umphreys McGee.
[01:02:52.407 --> 01:02:55.070]  Everyone all throughout the world are saying winning.
[01:02:56.591 --> 01:03:07.821]  People who are freedom lovers of Charlie Sheen fans, please show your friends 20 minutes with the president of Charlie Sheen and expose to them why Charlie Sheen is a great friend of 9-11 truth.
[01:03:07.821 --> 01:03:11.644]  Secondly, I saw Mark Kirk, Senator of Illinois, last Saturday.
[01:03:11.644 --> 01:03:16.829]  I asked him briefly about 9-11, Building 7, if he supports a new investigation.
[01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:21.493]  I talked to him about El Malcolm Virgo with Osama Bin Laden on the cover, June of 2001.
[01:03:22.754 --> 01:03:26.977]  Looked at me and said that he's comfortable with the 9-11 Commission report.
[01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:30.660]  Winning, Mark Kirk proved again he's a neocon.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.782]  Well Julio, let me throw this out.
[01:03:33.782 --> 01:03:35.583]  We are changes on fire everywhere.
[01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:45.570]  The confrontations, the real reporting, and the globalists now are in the Congress when Hillary was speaking and others saying there's now these citizen reporters going everywhere confronting us.
[01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:46.591]  We're losing control.
[01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:49.433]  Yeah, the American people are taking our media back.
[01:03:50.356 --> 01:03:51.477]  Last thing, Alex.
[01:03:51.477 --> 01:03:55.379]  USA Today, please put this up so people can see this.
[01:03:55.379 --> 01:03:56.379]  They won't believe me.
[01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:59.701]  USA Today money, February 25th, 2011.
[01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:03.043]  Can geoengineering put the freeze on global warming?
[01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:05.704]  They specifically talk about chemtrailing.
[01:04:05.704 --> 01:04:06.685]  Oh yeah, no, no, no.
[01:04:06.685 --> 01:04:10.507]  Chemtrails don't exist, but exactly what we said 15 years ago is what they admit it is.
[01:04:10.507 --> 01:04:11.528]  What's the headline again?
[01:04:11.528 --> 01:04:13.889]  Can geoengineering put the freeze on global warming?
[01:04:14.798 --> 01:04:15.398]  Exactly.
[01:04:15.398 --> 01:04:15.679]  U.S.
[01:04:15.679 --> 01:04:16.559]  Pay Today money.
[01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:17.780]  Folks, we're winning.
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.021]  We already won.
[01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.342]  We have the truth on our side.
[01:04:21.342 --> 01:04:21.982]  Winning.
[01:04:21.982 --> 01:04:24.124]  As Max Keiser is saying, what's wrong with us?
[01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:25.665]  Let's get our... Duh!
[01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:26.965]  Winning!
[01:04:26.965 --> 01:04:27.426]  Winning.
[01:04:27.426 --> 01:04:28.206]  God bless, Alex.
[01:04:28.206 --> 01:04:28.726]  I love you, man.
[01:04:28.726 --> 01:04:29.747]  I'm praying for you.
[01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:38.232]  People, pray for Charlie Sheen to find a woman of freedom and a woman of the Lord, too, so we can have him peacefully marching for our freedoms back.
[01:04:38.232 --> 01:04:39.053]  God bless everyone.
[01:04:39.053 --> 01:04:39.553]  I love you all.
[01:04:39.913 --> 01:04:40.454]  Absolutely.
[01:04:40.454 --> 01:04:55.408]  Yeah, Charlie's going through a lot right now, and I've seen different sides of him, but he certainly is about just being bold and out in the open, and we hope after, you know, he calms down from being clean that he can get back into exposing the New World Order, because what a powerful tool that's going to be.
[01:04:55.408 --> 01:04:56.910]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:57.450]  Stay with us.
[01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.612]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.473 --> 01:05:01.654]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.654 --> 01:05:08.581]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.581 --> 01:05:11.143]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.143 --> 01:05:16.308]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.508 --> 01:05:19.549]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:21.870]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:28.112]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.112 --> 01:05:31.494]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:37.276]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.276 --> 01:05:38.917]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.917 --> 01:05:40.217]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.217 --> 01:05:42.738]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.878 --> 01:05:47.102]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.102 --> 01:05:51.726]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:51.726 --> 01:05:54.329]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:57.331]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:05:57.331 --> 01:05:57.952]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:05.969]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:05.969 --> 01:06:14.831]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:19.452]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.452 --> 01:06:30.274]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:30.914 --> 01:06:40.418]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.418 --> 01:06:45.860]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:53.344]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.344 --> 01:06:56.105]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:07:01.232 --> 01:07:04.874]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:08.495]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.495 --> 01:07:13.297]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.297 --> 01:07:19.680]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.921]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.461 --> 01:07:22.761]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:22.761 --> 01:07:23.022]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.022 --> 01:07:23.603]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:23.603 --> 01:07:24.404]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.404 --> 01:07:26.086]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:43.505]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.505 --> 01:07:48.646]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:07:48.646 --> 01:08:00.909]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:00.909 --> 01:08:06.490]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:19.179]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, a little bit into the next hour, Mark Dice joins us up on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:08:22.628 --> 01:08:26.853]  Can geoengineering put the freeze on global warming?
[01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:27.453]  Oh!
[01:08:27.453 --> 01:08:28.795]  They are chemtrailing.
[01:08:28.795 --> 01:08:34.681]  Can airplanes spray aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other things in there to save us?
[01:08:34.681 --> 01:08:37.845]  Oh, see, the chemtrails are real.
[01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:38.846]  Now they're not denying it.
[01:08:38.846 --> 01:08:43.832]  They're rolling it out that they were saving us with this 16-year-long secret program.
[01:08:44.724 --> 01:08:52.909]  Now joining us is Mark Dice, author of Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, and I think it's the most powerful book he's ever written.
[01:08:52.909 --> 01:09:00.854]  We carry all of his books at InfoWars.com, but we've teamed up with Mark when he contacted us a few months ago with this idea.
[01:09:00.854 --> 01:09:04.537]  In the first three and a half months of its publication, we're going to be the exclusive
[01:09:05.097 --> 01:09:08.699]  Place to get Big Brother the Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:09:08.699 --> 01:09:13.162]  It starts shipping what the 21st of this month and a little over two weeks from now.
[01:09:13.162 --> 01:09:14.702]  So get your pre-orders in.
[01:09:14.702 --> 01:09:17.964]  They have been printed and they're on their way to us right now.
[01:09:17.964 --> 01:09:21.266]  Big Brother the Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:09:21.266 --> 01:09:28.290]  So many people know about Big Brother and Orwell, but this illustrates and basically analyzes the book and shows how we've really gone beyond that.
[01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:31.832]  In many respects, in this social engineering.
[01:09:31.832 --> 01:09:34.534]  Again, it's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:09:34.534 --> 01:09:39.377]  When you get the book, it also supports Mark, it also supports what we're doing, and it helps get the word out to everybody.
[01:09:39.377 --> 01:09:40.898]  You may already know about all this.
[01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:42.780]  Get the book, give it to friends and family.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:48.584]  We also have some combo deals where you can get my videos at less than half off when you get them with the book.
[01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:55.609]  So, available at InfoWars.com, or if you want to call, tell the folks here at the office, you want Big Brother, the Orwellian Nightmare, come true, 888-253-6000.
[01:09:58.613 --> 01:10:00.057]  3139.
[01:10:00.057 --> 01:10:01.602]  Mark Dice, great to have you on with us.
[01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:02.835]  Hey, thanks.
[01:10:02.835 --> 01:10:03.635]  It's a big day.
[01:10:03.635 --> 01:10:10.897]  It's De-Friend Day today on Facebook, the day when we clean up our friends list and delete the strangers and scumbags.
[01:10:10.897 --> 01:10:16.459]  We can get into some of the details about that and the other Orwellian aspects of Facebook.
[01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:18.880]  But, you know, I've been making the comparisons.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:26.582]  Everybody, this audience, has been drawing comparisons, seeing the comparisons between what we are experiencing in our world and Orwell's books.
[01:10:26.582 --> 01:10:28.403]  So I've compiled about 300 pages of them.
[01:10:30.183 --> 01:10:36.686]  It's very, very scary what's going to be coming around the corner here just in a few months and in a few years.
[01:10:36.686 --> 01:10:49.170]  I mean, we have everything we've been talking about now and cited in trade journals or maybe just things that are being implemented or working on patents, patent applications.
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:53.732]  All of this stuff is coming to a fruition, to the Orwellian nightmare.
[01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:56.393]  And if we don't all come together and wake up and stand up,
[01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:59.935]  That's right, we should be afraid of doing nothing.
[01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:04.237]  Go back to 1997 when I got arrested protesting the thumb scanners.
[01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:12.802]  Yes.
[01:11:32.668 --> 01:11:41.194]  And just as even the mainstream media is decrying what they're doing, if we make these other Orwellian issues important as well, we can start turning the tide against it.
[01:11:41.194 --> 01:11:42.936]  We don't have a choice.
[01:11:42.936 --> 01:11:47.159]  And hence your manifesto, Big Brother, the Orwellian nightmare come true, Mark.
[01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:49.160]  I salute you on this book.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.401]  Your other three books are excellent.
[01:11:50.401 --> 01:11:51.042]  This blows them away.
[01:11:52.415 --> 01:11:54.056]  That's already been put in in England!
[01:12:16.394 --> 01:12:17.475]  Yeah, they're already testing.
[01:12:17.475 --> 01:12:22.219]  This is already coming out, so we don't have much time before we're living in the Orwellian nightmare.
[01:12:22.219 --> 01:12:34.871]  And it's very critical of the social structure, the control of information, the perpetual state of war, the personification of the party, the telescreens, the snitch culture, the degraded and corrupted
[01:12:35.655 --> 01:12:38.796]  There's a global revolution against every canon of freedom.
[01:12:38.796 --> 01:12:42.697]  Telescreens going in 9,000 locations saying spy on your neighbors.
[01:12:42.697 --> 01:12:47.859]  Forbes comes out today and admits Docs revealed TSA planned a body scan.
[01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:50.720]  Pedestrians, train passengers, they're already doing it.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.600]  It's all happening.
[01:12:52.165 --> 01:13:02.598]  Listen, there's a case in India of a woman that was convicted of murder because a machine read her mind and said that she had experiential knowledge of the murder scene.
[01:13:02.598 --> 01:13:06.062]  So there's technology coming out that is already out, I guess.
[01:13:06.062 --> 01:13:09.046]  They're just unrolling newer and more advanced versions that
[01:13:09.566 --> 01:13:16.110]  Supposedly, raise your mind, and can allegedly determine whether you have seen or heard something.
[01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:23.235]  So, these machines have already convicted people of murder in foreign countries, and it's coming here.
[01:13:23.235 --> 01:13:33.722]  The Aurelian Nightmare is going to come true if we do not all stand up, wake up, come together, stop being afraid, expose the false flag terrorism, and come together and restore the Republic.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:43.066]  Well, Mark, let's walk through your book and the different chapters and why this is such an important tome.
[01:13:43.066 --> 01:13:46.790]  Well, let's start off with Facebook Defriend Day.
[01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:49.172]  There's a whole section in the book about Facebook.
[01:13:49.172 --> 01:13:52.034]  And again, much of this audience may be familiar with this.
[01:13:52.034 --> 01:13:53.475]  So this is for the masses.
[01:13:53.475 --> 01:14:00.221]  This is for the people that aren't aware of these issues or maybe the people that are just starting to care about what's going on.
[01:14:00.221 --> 01:14:02.443]  And so we're announcing Facebook Defriend Day.
[01:14:03.524 --> 01:14:04.085]  I don't know.
[01:14:22.788 --> 01:14:25.750]  For underage drinking, this is Big Brother.
[01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.792]  This is what we're trying to fight.
[01:14:27.792 --> 01:14:35.017]  So, Facebook Defriende, there's an article on Infowars.com that kind of details some of the Orwellian aspects of Facebook.
[01:14:35.017 --> 01:14:45.785]  Not to mention just the social implications of the narcissism and the self-absorption that these websites, these supposed social networking sites, have created.
[01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:50.449]  But let's take another look at some of the creepy aspects that Facebook has
[01:14:51.608 --> 01:14:53.889]  Before we do that, let me just add, it's like Google.
[01:14:53.889 --> 01:15:02.534]  You think you're going to the Oracle to get information, but it's actually tracking what you're thinking, what you're doing, where you're going to eat, what movies you're watching.
[01:15:02.534 --> 01:15:06.055]  It's building a detailed psychological breakdown on you.
[01:15:06.055 --> 01:15:13.119]  The same thing's happening with Facebook, and you've got the founder of it calling his users idiots, saying that they trust him, that they're morons.
[01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:21.131]  Yeah, and there's new facial recognition software that's out that's going to identify everybody in every photo that's posted on Facebook on the internet.
[01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:26.633]  There were apps that were created, I think they've been pulled from the app stores now from Android and iPhone.
[01:15:26.633 --> 01:15:36.236]  There's apps that are created where you can take a photo of some random stranger and using facial recognition software it will search Facebook, MySpace, the internet and find that person.
[01:15:36.736 --> 01:15:37.656]  That's creepy.
[01:15:37.656 --> 01:15:38.937]  That's the Orwellian nightmare.
[01:15:38.937 --> 01:15:42.258]  That's what we're going to have to start learning about.
[01:15:42.258 --> 01:15:44.618]  What are these social implications here?
[01:15:44.618 --> 01:15:45.919]  And what are we going to do?
[01:15:45.919 --> 01:15:47.819]  Are we going to live in a kind of world like this?
[01:15:47.819 --> 01:15:57.462]  And the way that they're rolling it out is through the fear of false flag terrorism, through dumbing us down, eroding the culture, painting foreign countries as enemies.
[01:15:58.062 --> 01:16:00.124]  Everybody in Iran must be an enemy.
[01:16:00.124 --> 01:16:05.950]  There's so many parallels between 1984 and our world here.
[01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:09.793]  Just listen to what Orwell wrote in 1949.
[01:16:09.793 --> 01:16:16.740]  He says, quote, with all their cleverness, they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.665]  Well, Orwell was right on a lot of stuff, but he didn't think about the mind-reading machines
[01:16:22.486 --> 01:16:28.234]  The most dangerous time was when you were asleep, when you might, you know, give yourself up in a word.
[01:16:29.411 --> 01:16:42.694]  You know, yeah, he talks about, listen to this, I mean, the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing over of all power to a small caste seem natural, unavoidable condition of survival.
[01:16:42.694 --> 01:16:44.734]  I mean, this is prophetic, nearly.
[01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:53.816]  I mean, here we have, just let me go through another couple shocking quotes that I've pulled out of this book, and they fit right in with what's going on in our society today.
[01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:54.696]  We have, quote,
[01:16:55.476 --> 01:17:00.605]  In the past, no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance.
[01:17:00.605 --> 01:17:07.317]  The invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and radio carried the process further.
[01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:11.403]  We have become a culture of corrupt morons.
[01:17:11.403 --> 01:17:13.263]  But there's a glimmer of hope, Alex.
[01:17:13.263 --> 01:17:15.524]  I see the V for Victory campaign.
[01:17:15.524 --> 01:17:19.525]  I see everybody getting out there and educating people about these issues.
[01:17:19.525 --> 01:17:22.265]  Poster campaigns, educational outreaches.
[01:17:22.265 --> 01:17:25.486]  And so I see a glimmer of hope here.
[01:17:25.486 --> 01:17:28.187]  And if we can just continue to educate people, get the word out,
[01:17:28.687 --> 01:17:31.590]  We can come together and... Well, resistance, you're saying it.
[01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:36.174]  If we stand up, if we speak out, if we rebuke all this tyranny, it will fail.
[01:17:36.174 --> 01:17:41.398]  But if we decide it's a foregone conclusion that we're going to go into this tyranny, we're going to lose.
[01:17:41.398 --> 01:17:42.519]  Resistance is victory.
[01:17:49.911 --> 01:18:06.595]  It's been pulled and brought in behind the scenes from the Rockefeller Foundation, who actually recruited the head of the Identix, the number one facial recognition software company.
[01:18:06.595 --> 01:18:07.616]  It was recruited in 1991.
[01:18:09.296 --> 01:18:09.717]  I don't know.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.562]  And this is going to be used to buy and sell.
[01:18:27.562 --> 01:18:28.922]  It's going to be your new ID.
[01:18:28.922 --> 01:18:31.424]  The government, the social engineers admit this.
[01:18:31.424 --> 01:18:37.147]  And that if you're not a good globalist, it doesn't matter what you have to pay for your food with or your house.
[01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:38.608]  You're just shut down.
[01:18:38.608 --> 01:18:40.108]  And that's what Homeland Security has said.
[01:18:40.108 --> 01:18:43.370]  You're going to have to have TSA approval to own a gun, to have a job.
[01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.611]  This is total control.
[01:18:46.115 --> 01:18:50.800]  It's total control, and let's look at the snitch culture.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.627]  Everybody's being turned into a paranoid person that there's terrorists around every corner.
[01:18:56.627 --> 01:19:00.551]  The if you see something, say something campaign from Walnart.
[01:19:00.551 --> 01:19:04.175]  It's becoming so unbelievably absurd.
[01:19:05.396 --> 01:19:09.579]  It's time to start standing up to speak truth to power.
[01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:18.585]  And it's so hard sometimes to articulate some of these issues to people when you're new to this or when you're trying to introduce somebody to this kind of information.
[01:19:18.585 --> 01:19:29.032]  And so the YouTube videos, the books, these are the ways to eloquently and powerfully communicate these complex ideas in a pretty simple way.
[01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:36.395]  Well, the new book, and we're going to walk through it and show the modern-day parallels that even surpass Orwell's nightmare vision.
[01:19:36.395 --> 01:19:40.158]  It's Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.

[01:20:23.388 --> 01:20:24.969]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:24.969 --> 01:20:28.572]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.

[01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:00.432]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[01:21:00.432 --> 01:21:02.854]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.854 --> 01:21:05.136]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.136 --> 01:21:08.338]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.338 --> 01:21:13.461]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.461 --> 01:21:17.644]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:17.964 --> 01:21:20.305]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.305 --> 01:21:23.186]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.186 --> 01:21:26.108]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.108 --> 01:21:33.691]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.031 --> 01:21:39.433]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.433 --> 01:21:42.274]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.274 --> 01:21:45.955]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:45.955 --> 01:21:47.035]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.376]  You're everyone else.

[01:22:29.062 --> 01:22:30.324]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:30.324 --> 01:22:34.871]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:34.871 --> 01:22:40.699]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[01:22:40.699 --> 01:22:44.064]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.304 --> 01:22:47.027]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.027 --> 01:22:52.092]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.375]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:56.537]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:56.537 --> 01:23:01.322]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[01:23:01.322 --> 01:23:01.922]  I have.
[01:23:01.922 --> 01:23:03.404]  And all of them don't taste that good.
[01:23:03.544 --> 01:23:05.846]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death.
[01:23:05.846 --> 01:23:09.168]  And yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:29.940]  Thank you.
[01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:14.293]  Shifting gears, but continuing to look at propaganda.
[01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:30.625]  Fox News, a whole bunch of other publications are asking the question, is Charlie Sheen's world-setting Twitter presence an elaborate stunt?
[01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:36.392]  And they're asking all over the news, did he stage all this wild stuff he's saying on air?
[01:24:36.392 --> 01:24:37.553]  Is this all fake?
[01:24:37.553 --> 01:24:41.897]  And people are asking me this because it all started on my show last Thursday, and the answer is no.
[01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:49.668]  The Charlie Sheen I know never did drugs or alcohol in front of me, was focused, was really into politics.
[01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:53.552]  Then he went on a seven-month party, kind of relapsed.
[01:24:53.552 --> 01:24:57.635]  Then he's now completely off everything and is wild.
[01:24:57.635 --> 01:25:03.240]  The media says having a manic episode is pretty normal when you kick hard alcohol and drugs overnight.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.420]  I don't know.
[01:25:19.227 --> 01:25:20.367]  It's real, okay?
[01:25:20.367 --> 01:25:20.927]  It's real.
[01:25:20.927 --> 01:25:23.848]  And people last week said, well, why did that happen on your show?
[01:25:23.848 --> 01:25:30.370]  Well, I was getting him on to talk about the fact that I've seen him, you know, when the nurse comes and urine test him, he is clean.
[01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:32.290]  I was with him a few weeks ago.
[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:35.511]  And then it turned into what you saw, and I didn't know what to think of it.
[01:25:35.511 --> 01:25:45.674]  But now Fox News and others report that the sheening of America in less than a week, troubled actor Charlie Sheen becomes country's top pop culture icon.
[01:25:46.614 --> 01:25:46.734]  And
[01:26:05.726 --> 01:26:21.933]  Control demolition the banker dictatorship the TSA the Federal Reserve I've been able to do that on many other channels and so overall I just hope he makes it out of all this because he The whole fight with CBS all of it is very very real mark guys.
[01:26:21.933 --> 01:26:24.675]  I haven't asked your view on this I'm gonna ask it live on air.
[01:26:24.675 --> 01:26:25.195]  What do you think?
[01:26:26.385 --> 01:26:32.787]  It's very interesting, and of course the conspiracy theories are going around that this is a planned stunt, but you can't plan something like that.
[01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:41.870]  I mean, and there's no way, and even if this was some sort of a planned stunt between you and Charlie, I mean, Charlie would be, during his interviews, would be talking about some New World Order issues.
[01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:43.070]  I mean, this, I think it just kind of...
[01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:45.051]  I think so.
[01:26:45.051 --> 01:26:45.591]  I think so.
[01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:46.031]  I think so.
[01:27:10.884 --> 01:27:13.485]  Well, my point is this.
[01:27:13.485 --> 01:27:20.066]  Charlie, I've known for six and a half years, was with his, you know, when he's been married, is totally faithful, is really into that.
[01:27:20.066 --> 01:27:25.368]  Certainly, I think almost the image of the show was the old Charlie Sheen from a decade ago.
[01:27:25.368 --> 01:27:30.389]  Now he's kind of gone back to that, gotten clean again, and it's this supercharged Charlie Sheen.
[01:27:30.389 --> 01:27:37.951]  And I don't endorse the lifestyle and everything he's doing, but the point is, he's not like Republican leaders at Bohemian Grove bringing in gay porn stars.
[01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:39.851]  The conservative media wants to ignore that.
[01:27:40.111 --> 01:27:47.576]  Well, it's fascinating.
[01:27:47.576 --> 01:27:58.264]  I mean, being on the other side of the media, you know just how things can get distorted and people in the media have no idea what he's talking about.
[01:27:58.264 --> 01:28:07.130]  They take jokes and quote them as being serious and it's very, very fascinating and I'm glad that Charlie Sheen was on board for 9-11 Truth.
[01:28:07.130 --> 01:28:07.731]  It's a great
[01:28:09.191 --> 01:28:13.472]  Yeah, people say that it then discredits 9-11 Truth.
[01:28:13.472 --> 01:28:14.553]  That's not how the media works.
[01:28:14.553 --> 01:28:20.814]  People then start thinking about 9-11 Truth and looking at evidence and Charlie Sheen then has nothing to do with it.
[01:28:20.814 --> 01:28:29.396]  People are so crazy that they think that you and him concocted the 9-11 Truth expose back in 2006 to discredit because you worked for the Pope.
[01:28:29.396 --> 01:28:35.978]  You were supposedly with me, Alex, when I bumped into Danny Bonaduce and you were the cameraman according to
[01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:42.765]  Yeah, and Charlie was running all that, and that's then the Vatican assassin.
[01:28:42.765 --> 01:28:44.167]  He's like, well, duh.
[01:28:44.167 --> 01:28:45.188]  We work for the Pope.
[01:28:45.188 --> 01:28:47.650]  We kill people.
[01:28:47.650 --> 01:28:49.512]  And then now that adds to it, which we love.
[01:28:49.512 --> 01:28:50.133]  Great.
[01:28:50.133 --> 01:28:51.434]  People want to say all that?
[01:28:51.434 --> 01:28:51.935]  Great.
[01:28:51.935 --> 01:28:52.656]  Okay, fine.
[01:28:52.656 --> 01:28:53.597]  I'm a Vatican assassin.
[01:28:53.917 --> 01:28:59.020]  It's kind of interesting and, you know, hey, Charlie, if you're listening, bro, we should write a book on 9-11.
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.401]  That would be good.
[01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.202]  You should be a best-selling author.
[01:29:02.202 --> 01:29:05.464]  And Charlie Sheen, New York Times, best-selling author, right?
[01:29:05.464 --> 01:29:11.568]  It's fascinating, but it's interesting that you were able to culture jam the view like nobody else.
[01:29:11.568 --> 01:29:13.069]  I mean, you just ran right over him.
[01:29:13.069 --> 01:29:16.311]  They didn't even have a chance to frame the question for the interview.
[01:29:16.311 --> 01:29:18.132]  Let me say one thing.
[01:29:18.132 --> 01:29:20.153]  Alex Jones starts off with and just rolls
[01:29:20.253 --> 01:29:20.653]  Right over.
[01:29:20.653 --> 01:29:21.833]  I mean, that's how it's done.
[01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:25.054]  That's how you bypass the mainstream media.
[01:29:25.054 --> 01:29:29.035]  You use them for your own message.
[01:29:29.035 --> 01:29:29.375]  Stay there.
[01:29:29.375 --> 01:29:30.275]  We're going to come back.
[01:29:30.275 --> 01:29:31.516]  Long segment coming up.

[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.203]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.506 --> 01:30:05.049]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.049 --> 01:30:05.970]  Number 1.
[01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:09.392]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.392 --> 01:30:10.253]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.253 --> 01:30:15.156]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.156 --> 01:30:15.896]  It's true.
[01:30:15.896 --> 01:30:20.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.600]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.182]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.182 --> 01:30:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.085 --> 01:30:29.885]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.885 --> 01:30:32.626]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.626 --> 01:30:36.308]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.308 --> 01:30:37.108]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.108 --> 01:30:41.250]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:46.312]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:30:46.312 --> 01:30:50.473]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:31:00.337 --> 01:31:01.498]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:08.441]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.441 --> 01:31:10.982]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:10.982 --> 01:31:16.365]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.365 --> 01:31:19.406]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.406 --> 01:31:21.467]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:27.972]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:27.972 --> 01:31:31.355]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.355 --> 01:31:37.140]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.781]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:38.781 --> 01:31:40.082]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.082 --> 01:31:42.744]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:42.744 --> 01:31:46.988]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:46.988 --> 01:31:49.570]  You can find the video at www dot
[01:31:50.070 --> 01:32:03.897]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:32:03.897 --> 01:32:05.018]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:32:05.018 --> 01:32:09.600]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:15.543]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:32:15.543 --> 01:32:16.203]  Gold and silver
[01:32:16.203 --> 01:32:16.563]  I don't know.
[01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:46.706]  We're good to go!
[01:33:14.246 --> 01:33:32.414]  Okay, we're going to continue breaking down Mark Dice's book, jam in some of the phone callers that are patiently holding.
[01:33:33.379 --> 01:33:36.680]  But we're doing two major salvos today.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.601]  I told Charlie three weeks ago, I said, you've got to get a Twitter account.
[01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:42.321]  You'll get millions of users.
[01:33:42.321 --> 01:33:45.002]  Then you can communicate directly with people.
[01:33:45.002 --> 01:33:51.164]  And hopefully down the road, he'll use it for political purposes, but I don't tell him what to do.
[01:33:51.164 --> 01:33:52.964]  Undoubtedly, there's some other plans on the road.
[01:33:52.964 --> 01:33:53.744]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:33:56.823 --> 01:33:58.485]  We are invading Twitter today.
[01:33:58.485 --> 01:34:02.289]  You know, I've had a Twitter account, I don't know, for eight months or so, I don't know, less than a year.
[01:34:02.289 --> 01:34:03.750]  I never really promoted it.
[01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:06.653]  It's twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[01:34:06.653 --> 01:34:07.214]  And you know what?
[01:34:07.214 --> 01:34:08.915]  We need 100,000 members.
[01:34:08.915 --> 01:34:12.940]  If Charlie can get almost 2 million in a couple of days, we should be able to get 100,000.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:17.484]  Because then anywhere I am, I can send a Twitter out if something's happening or the police are trying to arrest me.
[01:34:18.425 --> 01:34:20.066]  Or if something's unfolding.
[01:34:20.066 --> 01:34:22.567]  So we're doing the Google Bomb search term today.
[01:34:22.567 --> 01:34:24.929]  Please put it in Google over and over again.
[01:34:24.929 --> 01:34:26.189]  Alex Jones Twitter.
[01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:29.891]  Just three words into Google and hit enter, enter, enter over and over again.
[01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:33.013]  We're going to test their new algorithm and see if they're able to block us out.
[01:34:33.013 --> 01:34:34.994]  It's Alex Jones Twitter.
[01:34:34.994 --> 01:34:37.075]  I haven't done a Google Bomb in over a week.
[01:34:37.075 --> 01:34:38.876]  Alex Jones Twitter.
[01:34:38.876 --> 01:34:41.357]  Please help that become number one today.
[01:34:41.357 --> 01:34:42.218]  And we have our article.
[01:34:43.018 --> 01:34:43.458]  Dealing with it.
[01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.500]  We'll go back to Mark in a moment with another announcement.
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:52.264]  Let me go ahead and read this article by Paul Joseph Watson that just went out at PrisonPlanet.com about 15 minutes ago.
[01:34:52.264 --> 01:34:53.865]  It's also going up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:12.858 --> 01:35:13.078]  We're good.
[01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:59.962]  Despite dominating the likes of YouTube, while approaching 100 million views on one of our YouTube channels alone, as well as Facebook, Myspace, and Alexa, not to mention Google Trends, which have been successfully topped on dozens of separate occasions, it's over 70 now, the info war has yet to take Twitter by storm, and we urgently need to redress the balance with the aid of our fantastic supporters and fellow info warriors.
[01:36:00.322 --> 01:36:11.336]  To understand how quickly a new meme can invade and take over Twitter, just look at the reaction Charlie Sheen was able to generate when he signed up to use the networking tool.
[01:36:11.336 --> 01:36:17.904]  After less than a week, Sheen already has 1.5 million followers and has attracted 1 million of them in just one day.
[01:36:17.904 --> 01:36:18.585]  It's over that now.
[01:36:18.945 --> 01:36:25.730]  Contrary to reports, it was not solely CNN host Piers Morgan that convinced Sheen to sign up on Twitter this past weekend.
[01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:32.195]  During a visit to Sheen's home more than three weeks ago, Alex Jones convinced the actor to start his own Twitter account.
[01:36:32.195 --> 01:36:34.897]  But Jones is guilty of not following his own advice.
[01:36:34.897 --> 01:36:48.428]  InfoWars is a Twitter account at twitter.com forward slash realalexjones, but we've hardly even promoted it, let alone used it in the InfoWars to start viral hashtags, or indeed invade those memes already circulating with the message of truth.
[01:36:49.787 --> 01:36:49.867]  And
[01:37:10.194 --> 01:37:10.434]  I think so.
[01:37:27.663 --> 01:37:31.445]  And let me just go ahead and as the page is loading, go back over those.
[01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:35.448]  One of them is Big Brother, the Orwellian nightmare come true.
[01:37:35.448 --> 01:37:41.111]  And the other, of course, is today is Defriend Day on Facebook.
[01:37:41.111 --> 01:37:43.893]  And I want Mark to talk more about that right now.
[01:37:43.893 --> 01:37:50.037]  You've got cops, spies, minions, corporations that get you to friend them or to accept them as friends.
[01:37:50.037 --> 01:37:55.841]  And just to have more members, people do it and then they start tracking everything you're doing.
[01:37:55.841 --> 01:37:56.341]  So let's
[01:37:56.821 --> 01:38:03.407]  Friend patriots and liberty lovers today, but let's de-friend all of the spammers and the rest of the garbage.
[01:38:03.407 --> 01:38:06.730]  And so, he wants to launch another Google term.
[01:38:06.730 --> 01:38:07.210]  We do this a lot.
[01:38:07.210 --> 01:38:10.373]  We've had the number one, number two, number three, number four, number five in a row before.
[01:38:10.373 --> 01:38:11.654]  Let's do two today.
[01:38:11.654 --> 01:38:15.177]  Alex Jones Twitter, but secondarily, let's make this number two or number one.
[01:38:15.177 --> 01:38:17.619]  It's up to you, your choice.
[01:38:17.619 --> 01:38:20.241]  That today is de-friend day on Facebook.
[01:38:20.241 --> 01:38:23.204]  Explain why this is important and from that headline, Mark,
[01:38:23.664 --> 01:38:26.345]  Well, should we say today is Defriend Day?
[01:38:26.345 --> 01:38:28.666]  Or Defriend Day?
[01:38:28.666 --> 01:38:30.907]  Just search that?
[01:38:30.907 --> 01:38:31.847]  Because shorter is better.
[01:38:31.847 --> 01:38:35.229]  Let's just do Defriend Day Facebook.
[01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:36.409]  How's that sound?
[01:38:36.409 --> 01:38:40.891]  What terms from your article do we want to choose right now and get a viral attack on the globalists, Mark?
[01:38:41.311 --> 01:38:44.975]  Today is Defriend Day, or just Defriend Day.
[01:38:44.975 --> 01:38:48.939]  I know I talked a little bit about it in the beginning of our interview, but listen to this.
[01:38:48.939 --> 01:39:01.853]  Remember when Eliot Spencer's hooker scandal broke, and the governor of New York, and we saw photos of his young, high-class hooker all over the news, and all of her family, photos of her family too.
[01:39:02.453 --> 01:39:05.634]  And you've got to sit back and think, wait, where did these photos come?
[01:39:05.634 --> 01:39:08.495]  Those photos came from her Facebook page.
[01:39:08.495 --> 01:39:11.496]  This girl had a Facebook, or MySpace page, rather.
[01:39:11.496 --> 01:39:25.762]  And you enter into a licensing agreement with Facebook, with MySpace, and you're licensing your photos to them, and you're granting them sub-licensable agreements, and you're not getting any royalties, you have no rights.
[01:39:27.202 --> 01:39:33.505]  Her lawyer, Elliot Spitzer's hooker's lawyer, tried to sue MySpace for copyright infringement.
[01:39:33.505 --> 01:39:36.006]  Said that she owned the copyright to those photos.
[01:39:36.006 --> 01:39:38.347]  But read the terms of service, people.
[01:39:38.347 --> 01:39:39.747]  You don't own those photos anymore.
[01:39:39.747 --> 01:39:44.729]  You sub-licensed them out to Facebook, to Fox News, to News Corp, to anybody.
[01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:52.312]  That's why you've got to sub-link photos that you don't want them to steal to another site where you can reserve your rights.
[01:39:52.312 --> 01:39:53.653]  That's why it's important to do it that way.
[01:39:54.343 --> 01:39:56.124]  And this is just something to think about.
[01:39:56.124 --> 01:40:02.707]  I mean, maybe you're not going to get wrapped up in an international scandal, but how do you think this girl's family felt?
[01:40:02.707 --> 01:40:12.833]  Well, look at all the robberies where people are using people's Facebook to rob them because these idiots tell people when they're going to be gone, what time they go to work, where they're going, photos of inside their house.
[01:40:13.373 --> 01:40:16.215]  The Facebook terms of service keep changing too.
[01:40:16.215 --> 01:40:18.176]  Just a few days ago, I saw another article.
[01:40:18.176 --> 01:40:26.420]  There's this, whoops, I guess Facebook users didn't get the memo in terms of service change and they're using and selling and giving away your cell phone information, everything.
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:30.582]  Might as well go post your social security number on your Facebook page, people.
[01:40:30.582 --> 01:40:35.545]  So, what we're doing today, part of Operation Blindfold Big Brother.
[01:40:36.085 --> 01:40:36.386]  Yeah.
[01:40:54.386 --> 01:40:57.689]  I think the best search term is just D-Friend Day.
[01:40:57.689 --> 01:41:00.651]  D-E-F-R-I-E-N-D Day.
[01:41:00.651 --> 01:41:02.873]  Two words into Google over and over again.
[01:41:02.873 --> 01:41:03.714]  Let's hit them.
[01:41:03.714 --> 01:41:04.895]  Let's hit them hard, folks.
[01:41:04.895 --> 01:41:07.457]  You've got so much power if you take action.
[01:41:07.457 --> 01:41:08.357]  D-Friend Day.
[01:41:08.357 --> 01:41:09.498]  Put it in Google right now.
[01:41:09.498 --> 01:41:10.479]  Google bomb them.
[01:41:10.479 --> 01:41:13.021]  Here's a quote from George Orwell's 1984, again written in 1949, and it's
[01:41:17.176 --> 01:41:18.237]  It's very prophetic here.
[01:41:18.237 --> 01:41:22.883]  He says, quote, if there was hope, it must lie with the proles.
[01:41:22.883 --> 01:41:24.986]  That's you and me, the lower class people.
[01:41:24.986 --> 01:41:34.277]  Because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, 85% of the population of Oceania could force to destroy the party.
[01:41:34.938 --> 01:41:35.319]  We're good.
[01:41:48.786 --> 01:41:50.667]  But they don't believe in their own power.
[01:41:50.667 --> 01:41:56.590]  He talks about how they're obsessed with sports, with endless calculations about how to try to win the lottery.
[01:41:56.590 --> 01:42:00.673]  But then when you talk to the proles about real information, it's like they can't listen.
[01:42:00.673 --> 01:42:08.477]  And the culture in the world of 1984 was shaped by the ministry of truth, the propaganda ministry.
[01:42:08.477 --> 01:42:12.799]  Just like the culture of people's attitudes are shaped today by the mainstream media.
[01:42:12.799 --> 01:42:17.322]  Just listen to this, Orwell wrote, all beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions,
[01:42:17.962 --> 01:42:28.882]  Mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and to prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived.
[01:42:29.850 --> 01:42:31.192]  That's what we have today.
[01:42:31.192 --> 01:42:38.361]  You know, also, too, Alex, part of Operation Blindfold Big Brother today, I'd like to launch Phone Mob Friday.
[01:42:38.361 --> 01:42:41.244]  I'd like everybody to phone mob Sean Hannity.
[01:42:41.244 --> 01:42:42.065]  I think it's fun.
[01:42:42.065 --> 01:42:48.413]  It's a way that everybody, with one phone call, you can speak to hundreds of thousands of people, maybe millions.
[01:42:48.413 --> 01:42:48.794]  I'm not sure what
[01:42:48.894 --> 01:42:52.376]  All right, I'm gonna interrupt you because we've got an emergency right here.
[01:42:52.376 --> 01:43:01.400]  I just searched Defriend Day, Mark, and I didn't know that it had already been done last year by other people, so it's gonna send traffic to a place that makes no sense.
[01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:04.381]  Stop putting Defriend Day in, folks.
[01:43:04.381 --> 01:43:06.702]  You've got to put in Defriend Day
[01:43:07.282 --> 01:43:08.644]  Infowars.com.
[01:43:08.644 --> 01:43:09.265]  Three words.
[01:43:09.265 --> 01:43:14.813]  Defrendainfowars.com or they will not go to the Mark Dice exclusive article.
[01:43:14.813 --> 01:43:17.938]  So the two search terms are Alex Jones Twitter.
[01:43:17.938 --> 01:43:18.479]  That's one.
[01:43:18.479 --> 01:43:20.061]  Put those in over and over again.
[01:43:20.061 --> 01:43:20.562]  But put in
[01:43:21.926 --> 01:43:24.748]  DefriendeInfowars.com.
[01:43:24.748 --> 01:43:25.509]  Those three words.
[01:43:25.509 --> 01:43:27.810]  DefriendeInfowars.com.
[01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:28.911]  Put it in over and over again.
[01:43:28.911 --> 01:43:30.132]  We cannot fail.
[01:43:30.132 --> 01:43:31.853]  We kind of false started on that.
[01:43:31.853 --> 01:43:33.835]  I just wanted to check what was already up there.
[01:43:33.835 --> 01:43:36.156]  It is not Mark's article or Mark's video.
[01:43:36.156 --> 01:43:44.422]  More importantly than calling Sean Hannity, we need to send out this video and this article at Infowars.com to local radio, TV, and national news.
[01:43:44.422 --> 01:43:45.143]  They will bite
[01:43:45.743 --> 01:43:46.723]  Mark's done this many times.
[01:43:46.723 --> 01:43:54.165]  It will get him on national TV thinking he's going to talk bad about Facebook, which he is, and then he's going to be able to bring up how it's a surveillance grid.
[01:43:54.165 --> 01:43:58.927]  This is a major culture jamming operation if you will take action.
[01:43:58.927 --> 01:44:02.628]  So Defriende, Infowars.com, that's the search engine.
[01:44:02.628 --> 01:44:03.208]  Sorry.
[01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:03.628]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:44:04.212 --> 01:44:05.012]  Yeah, that's okay.
[01:44:05.012 --> 01:44:14.214]  I want to get into some other creepy stuff here in the book regarding new ways to listen to children, spy on children, and actually listen to them.
[01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:18.755]  Now there's little creepy GPS devices that parents are planting on their children.
[01:44:18.755 --> 01:44:26.337]  And there's more and more Barbies with cameras that people can dial into, and the laptops in Pennsylvania with the schools watching the kids at home.
[01:44:26.337 --> 01:44:27.177]  It's just all happening.
[01:44:27.637 --> 01:44:32.021]  Everybody's familiar with the red light cameras, the photo red cameras out here in San Diego.
[01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:36.885]  If you blow a red light that has a photo red camera, you get almost a $500 ticket.
[01:44:36.885 --> 01:44:43.331]  But what's even more worse is that there are, in a few years here, maybe sooner, they're already testing the system in other countries.
[01:44:43.331 --> 01:44:48.475]  We're going to have automatic speeding tickets if you just automatically go over the speed limit, it's just going to deduct the ticket.
[01:44:48.475 --> 01:44:49.977]  Yeah, they're going to put the boxes in your car.
[01:44:49.977 --> 01:44:51.238]  It's already being tested here in Austin.
[01:44:51.815 --> 01:44:59.379]  Yeah, also, too, there are testing systems where if you park in a bus lane, it just automatically tickets you.
[01:44:59.379 --> 01:45:01.800]  This is a hellish world that we're entering.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:02.561]  We must stop it.
[01:45:03.188 --> 01:45:05.929]  Yeah, there needs to be some social regulation.
[01:45:05.929 --> 01:45:14.151]  We can't just let this unroll on us and sit back and let them unroll it with the fear-based initiative.
[01:45:14.151 --> 01:45:16.291]  So, there's so much here.
[01:45:16.291 --> 01:45:22.513]  I have patents, Alex, of implantable GPS devices, a company called Persephone.
[01:45:23.203 --> 01:45:24.124]  We're good to go.
[01:45:39.115 --> 01:45:46.041]  This is a patent to implant the device forcibly into your system, so you can't remove it.
[01:45:46.041 --> 01:45:49.164]  I can get into some of the information here.
[01:45:49.164 --> 01:46:02.215]  The device, I'm reading right from the application, the device may include a microphone or similar device for monitoring acoustic information, therefore permitting the person to talk to a remote location.
[01:46:02.215 --> 01:46:07.439]  This is talking about, this is a patent application for forcibly implanting a GPS device
[01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.801]  I don't even want to tell you where.
[01:46:10.801 --> 01:46:15.824]  Into a very personal part of your body.
[01:46:15.824 --> 01:46:23.349]  And expanding on that, we already see all over the country school kids who are true in a few times, now they've got to wear ankle bracelets.
[01:46:23.349 --> 01:46:26.210]  Again, they're training everybody for this.
[01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:27.131]  It's all coming in pretty soon.
[01:46:27.131 --> 01:46:31.674]  We're going to have Paris Hilton probably take a Verichip or something and tout how cool it is.
[01:46:32.515 --> 01:46:34.778]  And it's just the greatest, greatest thing to do.
[01:46:34.778 --> 01:46:38.382]  But part of... I want to get back to Operation Phone Mob Friday.
[01:46:38.382 --> 01:46:39.364]  Phone Mob Fridays.
[01:46:40.209 --> 01:46:43.590]  Some people may have heard some of my phone calls over the past few years.
[01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:45.931]  You can call into these talk shows.
[01:46:45.931 --> 01:46:47.232]  Call in at the top of the hour.
[01:46:47.232 --> 01:46:48.532]  They give out the phone numbers.
[01:46:48.532 --> 01:46:49.932]  Go search the phone number.
[01:46:49.932 --> 01:46:55.154]  Let's phone mob, or we'll get dozens of people to jam the Sean Hannity Show today.
[01:46:55.154 --> 01:46:56.455]  We could do other shows later.
[01:46:56.455 --> 01:47:03.057]  Let's get out the word about Facebook Defriend Day, about the Orwellian Nightmare, and let's call the show.
[01:47:03.357 --> 01:47:13.528]  And the way to get through, throw an Infowars.com at them, whatever you want, but the way to get through is whatever idiot topic they're on, go, oh yeah, I want to talk about that, and introduce your talk with that.
[01:47:13.528 --> 01:47:14.769]  Act like a stupid liberal.
[01:47:14.769 --> 01:47:16.551]  That's their favorite bait to take.
[01:47:16.551 --> 01:47:23.017]  Go like, I don't like him, he's bad, and he, you know, and they'll go, oh, we're going to put you right on, and then you can dominate them.
[01:47:23.017 --> 01:47:25.440]  What have you found is the best ways to get on these weasel shows?
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:33.467]  I call, most shows start just a few minutes after the top of the hour, so I will start to call at the top of the hour before it even goes to air.
[01:47:33.467 --> 01:47:37.451]  I find the phone number, I sit here at my desk and I call, readout, readout, readout.
[01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:44.417]  You can readout for five minutes and then the screener will pick up and you just tell them an interesting topic, a question, something.
[01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:49.162]  And you know, I don't like to lie to these people, so tell them an interesting topic and then maybe when you're on hold,
[01:47:49.882 --> 01:47:56.407]  If you come up with a better question or topic, then as soon as you're on the air, then you can fire away and speak to hundreds of thousands.
[01:47:56.407 --> 01:48:04.693]  And you can also look on their website and find out what they're going to be covering that day, so you can be ready and then talk about what they're talking about, but then tie it into the truth.
[01:48:04.693 --> 01:48:06.914]  Because see, those shows screen their calls, we don't.
[01:48:06.914 --> 01:48:07.615]  Here's what I want to do.
[01:48:07.615 --> 01:48:16.121]  I want to phone mob these systems so hard that they're going to implement a new caller ID based system, that they're going to not accept phone calls pretty soon because we're going to just
[01:48:16.801 --> 01:48:21.923]  Bring up so many real issues and jam the show with Bilderberg Group, Plugs, Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:21.923 --> 01:48:37.729]  We're going to really take over the airwaves, and I think that we can be so effective that we're going to cause them to implement the new caller ID-based systems so that they're going to be able to block out the, quote, problem callers like me, like others, and then they won't accept calls from people with a blocked phone number.
[01:48:37.729 --> 01:48:45.552]  So let's take advantage of this now while we can, because this system is probably coming very soon where they'll know exactly who you are when you're calling.
[01:48:45.712 --> 01:48:51.996]  O'Reilly already had that years ago and would threaten to send police after folks that mildly disagreed.
[01:48:51.996 --> 01:49:02.621]  Yeah, Bill O'Reilly has threatened to send the police and the Fox News security to callers' homes, whether he was trying to scare that caller, whether they do have a caller ID-based system.
[01:49:02.621 --> 01:49:03.962]  No, it turned out he did do that.
[01:49:03.962 --> 01:49:04.703]  It turned out he did, yeah.
[01:49:05.765 --> 01:49:16.009]  Well, they might have a call ID based system already because I've locked the call ID on my call when I call, on my phone when I call, and a lot of times they will ask me for my phone number and they'll say, let me call you back.
[01:49:16.009 --> 01:49:18.431]  And, uh, so I, I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:49:18.431 --> 01:49:20.071]  So I have, I'm still busy.
[01:49:20.071 --> 01:49:21.412]  I can't do this very much anymore.
[01:49:21.412 --> 01:49:26.034]  But that shows how much they don't want the people to be able to be heard on the electronic soapbox.
[01:49:26.664 --> 01:49:36.997]  Yeah, look, just imagine, folks, if you go out and ask Sean Hannity about the Bilderberg Group or the implantable GPS device or Defriend Day, you're talking to hundreds of thousands of people.
[01:49:36.997 --> 01:49:43.085]  You can be a very good activist this way and slam Sean Hannity.
[01:49:43.085 --> 01:49:43.426]  It's fun.
[01:49:43.986 --> 01:49:45.508]  I encourage everyone to participate.
[01:49:45.508 --> 01:49:50.373]  I'm going to be doing this Phone Mob Fridays with Sean Hannity today.
[01:49:50.373 --> 01:49:52.595]  You can find me on Facebook.
[01:49:52.595 --> 01:49:54.337]  Find Mark Dice.
[01:49:54.337 --> 01:49:57.000]  Subscribe to Mark Dice on YouTube and Twitter.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.005]  And I'll keep people posted on who we're going to be phone mobbing on which Fridays.
[01:50:02.005 --> 01:50:06.790]  And let's do this until we crash their system and they implement a new caller ID.
[01:50:07.090 --> 01:50:08.632]  But not just the big national shows.
[01:50:08.632 --> 01:50:13.378]  There's a lot of big marquee local shows that have 50, 60, 100,000 listeners.
[01:50:13.378 --> 01:50:15.160]  You can really get into those easy too.
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:18.525]  So you can go out for smaller plum targets as well.
[01:50:19.039 --> 01:50:21.460]  Yeah, and you know, you don't need a website.
[01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.061]  You don't need to be, you know, have your name getting out there.
[01:50:24.061 --> 01:50:27.163]  This, being in a position like Alex is in, like I'm in, is very stressful.
[01:50:27.163 --> 01:50:34.686]  It's not for everybody, but we can all just come together and work together to restore the Republic, to restore our own... Absolutely.
[01:50:34.686 --> 01:50:38.128]  Speaking of unscreened calls, we're going to come back in the next two segments, take calls.
[01:50:38.128 --> 01:50:39.348]  Then Bob Chapman's joining us.
[01:50:39.348 --> 01:50:41.269]  Folks, I want this book to be a big hit.
[01:50:41.269 --> 01:50:42.070]  It is powerful.
[01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:43.711]  Everybody knows about 1984.
[01:50:43.711 --> 01:50:48.494]  It's a great entree, you know, out to people who aren't aware of what's happening.
[01:50:48.494 --> 01:50:50.556]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.

[01:51:06.264 --> 01:51:06.965]  Listen.
[01:51:06.965 --> 01:51:11.228]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[01:51:11.228 --> 01:51:14.610]  Two years ago I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[01:51:14.610 --> 01:51:17.672]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[01:51:17.672 --> 01:51:21.054]  They wanted me to go on Plavix but I refused knowing the negative side effects.

[01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:36.777]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.

[01:52:00.083 --> 01:52:01.383]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.383 --> 01:52:06.965]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:06.965 --> 01:52:11.987]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:11.987 --> 01:52:17.009]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:17.549 --> 01:52:22.773]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.773 --> 01:52:25.094]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.

[01:54:21.141 --> 01:54:22.822]  Libby, you know, flies on an option.
[01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:24.943]  Obama gives strongest indication yet.
[01:54:24.943 --> 01:54:27.064]  US forces may be deployed in the Middle East.
[01:54:27.064 --> 01:54:28.284]  Rebellion.
[01:54:28.284 --> 01:54:31.846]  Corpus Christi TSA workers double down on pat-downs.
[01:54:32.566 --> 01:54:35.067]  That is just some of what's coming up today.
[01:54:35.067 --> 01:54:44.350]  Again, the Google search terms are Alex Jones Twitter, number one, and then, of course, DFriendDayInfoWars.com.
[01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:45.530]  Mark Dice is our guest.
[01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:46.711]  Matt in New York disagrees.
[01:54:46.711 --> 01:54:48.451]  We're going to have to go quick through these calls.
[01:54:48.451 --> 01:54:50.752]  I want to get to at least five or six here.
[01:54:50.752 --> 01:54:51.712]  Matt in New York disagrees.
[01:54:51.712 --> 01:54:52.893]  He goes the head of the line.
[01:54:52.893 --> 01:54:53.673]  You're on the air, Matt.
[01:54:54.838 --> 01:54:55.498]  Hey, Alex.
[01:54:55.498 --> 01:54:56.319]  Hey, Mark.
[01:54:56.319 --> 01:54:57.300]  I'll be brief.
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.701]  My disagreement is about Charlie Sheen.
[01:54:59.701 --> 01:55:04.664]  I think it's great that you support him because he is your personal friend and he needs that.
[01:55:04.664 --> 01:55:11.629]  But I would personally love it if you would say your piece about it and then let it go because not all publicity is good publicity.
[01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:14.090]  And I'll just tell you a quick story.
[01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:19.854]  I handed out some CDs of your interview with Lyndee Williams, which I thought was terrific and everyone needs to hear it.
[01:55:20.487 --> 01:55:25.510]  And somebody took it from me and said, Alex Jones, isn't that the guy who started the Charlie Sheen rant?
[01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:29.293]  And he kind of looked at me crooked, and it drove me bonkers.
[01:55:29.915 --> 01:55:30.535]  But what is this?
[01:55:30.535 --> 01:55:36.058]  I mean, when he goes on the CNN show, you know, the new guy that does Larry King, I mean, is it, I mean, is it, you know, is he bad?
[01:55:36.058 --> 01:55:39.079]  I mean, obviously, no one is going to like everything that goes on.
[01:55:39.079 --> 01:55:40.720]  I didn't even know that was going to happen.
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:43.061]  And I was, frankly, blindsided by it.
[01:55:43.061 --> 01:55:47.623]  But then, might as well use it to get people to learn about the New World Order.
[01:55:47.623 --> 01:55:49.504]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call, Matt.
[01:55:49.504 --> 01:55:51.125]  Mark Dice, your comments on what he just said.
[01:55:51.565 --> 01:55:54.607]  Yeah, you know, not everybody's going to like everything about everybody.
[01:55:54.607 --> 01:56:00.170]  I mean, Alex Jones, you're a wild, exciting guy, and a lot of your audience loves that.
[01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:02.351]  But, you know, some people just can't take it.
[01:56:02.351 --> 01:56:03.892]  You're running the wrong way.
[01:56:03.892 --> 01:56:06.113]  And, you know, call him out if that's the case.
[01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:10.095]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:56:10.095 --> 01:56:12.556]  You can maybe eloquently convey the information.
[01:56:12.556 --> 01:56:13.716]  Nobody's going to like everybody.
[01:56:13.716 --> 01:56:18.058]  Everybody has an issue with everything, but we're all just doing the best that we can.
[01:56:18.058 --> 01:56:22.460]  If you don't like the way Alex presents information, there's other people like
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:23.921]  Well, I'll say this, too.
[01:56:23.921 --> 01:56:30.007]  I've hardly talked about, I may talk five minutes a day about the Charlie Sheen thing when it's the biggest news story in the country.
[01:56:30.007 --> 01:56:37.815]  I probably could have already gotten him back on, folks, and we may in the future, but I'm not even, you know, believe me, we're certainly not even milking this.
[01:56:37.815 --> 01:56:41.638]  When I get invited on national TV, though, I will go on and inject real issues.
[01:56:41.638 --> 01:56:42.299]  Thank you, Matt.
[01:56:42.299 --> 01:56:43.841]  Dave and Shelley, you're on the air, Dave.
[01:56:45.305 --> 01:56:46.346]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:56:46.346 --> 01:56:51.029]  I just wanted to ask Mark Dice when he's going to hand out gold coins again.
[01:56:51.029 --> 01:56:59.855]  But the real reason that I called was in Chile, of course, we had the dictadura, the dictatorship.
[01:56:59.855 --> 01:57:05.158]  Prior to the dictatorship, we had 54 provinces, and now we have 15 regions.
[01:57:05.158 --> 01:57:05.899]  In 1979, the dictatorship
[01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:13.892]  Decided that having 54 provinces was too unruly.
[01:57:13.892 --> 01:57:18.395]  Well, same thing here with 10 FEMA regions and the 10 FEMA governors.
[01:57:18.395 --> 01:57:19.196]  Exactly.
[01:57:19.196 --> 01:57:20.657]  That's the problem.
[01:57:20.657 --> 01:57:26.840]  The big problem in the United States is watch out for FEMA and the 10 regions.
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:37.667]  Well, empires, when they conquer a country by stealth or overtly, always break things into new political jurisdictions to cut the people off from the legislative power centers.
[01:57:37.667 --> 01:57:39.208]  Mark Dice comments on Dave from Chile.
[01:57:40.222 --> 01:57:45.066]  Yeah, you know, Dave's comment, just so the audience knows, is his comment about my gold coin, giving out gold coins.
[01:57:45.066 --> 01:57:46.407]  It's a reference to a video I did.
[01:57:46.407 --> 01:57:54.013]  I tried to sell a gold coin to people for 50 bucks and tried to trade it for a cup of coffee, one ounce of gold, and nobody really wanted it.
[01:57:54.013 --> 01:57:57.175]  Yeah, the general dumbed-down people, what was that, in the Malibu area?
[01:57:57.175 --> 01:58:03.360]  You're there with a full, beautiful, gorgeous gold coin in their hand, and they're like, can I have a cup of coffee, a dollar cup?
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.000]  No, you can't, pal.
[01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:06.743]  Oh, well, they thought it was fake.
[01:58:06.743 --> 01:58:07.543]  That's why they didn't want it.
[01:58:07.543 --> 01:58:11.286]  Sorry, I redid the video where I offered the gold coin for free.
[01:58:11.286 --> 01:58:12.427]  Price is Right style.
[01:58:12.427 --> 01:58:13.948]  You can find this video on YouTube.
[01:58:13.948 --> 01:58:20.433]  I said, hey, if you can guess the cost of this gold coin, plus or minus, I think it was 25%, I would give it to them.
[01:58:20.433 --> 01:58:22.234]  And the lowest guess was 38 cents.
[01:58:22.234 --> 01:58:26.697]  The woman guessed 38 cents is how much an ounce of gold is worth.
[01:58:26.697 --> 01:58:28.599]  It was worth about $1,100 at the time.
[01:58:28.599 --> 01:58:31.301]  And I think the highest guess was a few hundred bucks that nobody won.
[01:58:32.557 --> 01:58:35.619]  But they know all about Paris Hilton and Charlie Sheen.
[01:58:35.619 --> 01:58:42.304]  So by breaking in through Charlie Sheen, we get the dumbbells to figure out what's happening.
[01:58:42.304 --> 01:58:43.925]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.925 --> 01:58:46.387]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.885 --> 01:58:56.146]  Tyranny is here.
[01:58:56.146 --> 01:59:00.090]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:02.312]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:59:02.312 --> 01:59:08.177]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:59:08.177 --> 01:59:14.422]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:59:14.842 --> 01:59:20.825]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:59:20.825 --> 01:59:25.007]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:59:25.007 --> 01:59:29.290]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:59:29.290 --> 01:59:35.233]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:59:35.233 --> 01:59:38.795]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:59:38.795 --> 01:59:40.776]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:59:40.776 --> 01:59:41.216]  It's here.

[02:00:05.455 --> 02:00:06.776]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.776 --> 02:00:08.537]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.537 --> 02:00:10.298]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.298 --> 02:00:11.879]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.879 --> 02:00:13.420]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:17.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.622 --> 02:00:21.665]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.944 --> 02:00:25.006]  It's a powerful new book.
[02:00:25.006 --> 02:00:27.389]  Big Brother, The Orwellian, Nightmare Come True.
[02:00:27.389 --> 02:00:29.872]  Great to wake up yourself to a higher degree.
[02:00:29.872 --> 02:00:34.237]  Your friends, your family, and it also supports Mark Dice and myself in terms of media.
[02:00:34.237 --> 02:00:35.939]  The only place to get it is InfoWars.com.
[02:00:38.188 --> 02:00:39.128]  Mark, we're almost out of time.
[02:00:39.128 --> 02:00:45.252]  We're obviously going to have you back up again next week because so much is happening and unfolding right now.
[02:00:45.252 --> 02:00:47.012]  We've got the V for Victory campaign.
[02:00:47.012 --> 02:00:49.594]  We'll be announcing the winner next week.
[02:00:49.594 --> 02:00:53.836]  Just incredible with the Answer 1984-1776 campaign.
[02:00:53.836 --> 02:00:58.178]  We're teaching folks that you can have victory through resistance with the information.
[02:00:58.178 --> 02:01:00.699]  Right now, let's go to Seth in California.
[02:01:00.699 --> 02:01:01.640]  You're on the air, Seth.
[02:01:02.952 --> 02:01:08.114]  Hi Alex, I have an idea for your show that's similar to the Google search term thing you do.
[02:01:08.114 --> 02:01:09.635]  Okay, tell us.
[02:01:09.635 --> 02:01:12.076]  Okay, I had my explanation written down here.
[02:01:12.076 --> 02:01:19.400]  Alright, one way the Illuminati keeps young people brainwashed is through the propping up of pop music stars who encourage being a mindless sheep.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:30.525]  One thing that can be done to fight against this is when music videos of these big pop stars are released on YouTube, Alex can call for people to go to the official YouTube channel that releases the videos, which is usually the Vevo channel, spelled V-E-V-O,
[02:01:31.693 --> 02:01:33.914]  And vote the video's thumbs down.
[02:01:33.914 --> 02:01:36.396]  Many people watch the videos, but not many people rate them.
[02:01:36.396 --> 02:01:39.178]  Sometimes for every thousand views, there's only one rating.
[02:01:39.178 --> 02:01:42.039]  And anyone with a free YouTube account can rate the videos.
[02:01:42.039 --> 02:01:45.402]  I personally rarely rate the YouTube videos, but I do pay attention to how they're rated.
[02:01:45.402 --> 02:01:48.824]  And I would think this is the same for many people.
[02:01:48.824 --> 02:01:57.069]  Some key pop stars to go after would be Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Jay-Z, Beyonce, and Kesha.
[02:01:57.566 --> 02:01:59.889]  Yeah, just everybody's doing their thing.
[02:01:59.889 --> 02:02:01.211]  Every little way.
[02:02:01.211 --> 02:02:07.059]  One little comment here, one little comment there.
[02:02:07.059 --> 02:02:07.960]  Everybody's working together.
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:08.721]  I think it's great.
[02:02:16.186 --> 02:02:28.713]  Well, I just happened to click on Mega Newsreader's channel on YouTube, and he's done the yeoman's work of posting hundreds of the Answer to 1984-1776 contest videos all in one spot.
[02:02:28.713 --> 02:02:31.614]  Something we haven't even gotten to yet, because every day is a new page.
[02:02:31.614 --> 02:02:34.556]  We've got to link all those pages together on InfoWars.
[02:02:34.556 --> 02:02:37.558]  I mean, right there, it's just all of us doing little something.
[02:02:38.078 --> 02:02:39.500]  Has such a huge effect.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.402]  People, you don't have to put your own face up there.
[02:02:41.402 --> 02:02:42.984]  Put a website up in front of it.
[02:02:42.984 --> 02:02:44.125]  Do YouTube videos.
[02:02:44.125 --> 02:02:45.026]  Talk about issues.
[02:02:45.026 --> 02:02:46.428]  Spend 10 minutes every day.
[02:02:46.428 --> 02:02:48.550]  You'll start reaching thousands of people a week.
[02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:49.872]  Maybe hundreds of thousands.
[02:02:49.872 --> 02:02:52.615]  Let your voice be heard, those of you that love liberty.
[02:02:52.615 --> 02:02:54.698]  Show others that we're really the majority.
[02:02:54.698 --> 02:02:58.002]  I mean, Mark, the liberty movement's the hottest thing right now.
[02:02:58.726 --> 02:02:58.966]  It is.
[02:02:58.966 --> 02:03:02.990]  I mean, it's a combination of different groups.
[02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:06.794]  You'll never hear about We Are Change or the Resistance in the mainstream media.
[02:03:06.794 --> 02:03:17.325]  You hear about the Tea Party, but all these different organizations, the Bon Paul Revolution, the Tea Party, the Resistance, Luke Rudowsky, and We Are Change, everybody's just working in concert.
[02:03:17.325 --> 02:03:19.407]  And I talk to people, Alex, that
[02:03:19.887 --> 02:03:36.763]  I've never heard about any of this stuff, your show, just kind of people that, our mainstream media people, retired, just ordinary folks, and they're talking about a revolution coming, and they feel the pulse on America, something's wrong here, and let me just
[02:03:37.349 --> 02:03:56.298]  Let's finish up here with another quote from Orwell where he wrote, "...left to themselves they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working and dying, not only without the impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the whole world could be other than it is."
[02:03:56.298 --> 02:03:57.319]  So let's not be like that.
[02:03:58.612 --> 02:03:59.572]  Well, you're right.
[02:03:59.572 --> 02:04:08.094]  And again, as we hurdle towards the world government openly being announced, we have headed them off at the pass, getting the word out.
[02:04:08.094 --> 02:04:12.195]  And as more of this comes true and becomes self-evident, our credibility goes up.
[02:04:12.195 --> 02:04:15.916]  So a lot of people don't know why they're even awake, but they know that something's wrong.
[02:04:15.916 --> 02:04:17.377]  They know about the globalists.
[02:04:17.377 --> 02:04:20.417]  They now know the Federal Reserve is the problem in every major poll.
[02:04:20.417 --> 02:04:22.498]  The sleeping giant is awakening.
[02:04:23.078 --> 02:04:29.364]  And I just hope that everybody will support you, Mark, will support us, and get this powerful, great read, very informative.
[02:04:29.364 --> 02:04:30.845]  You think you know it all, folks, you don't.
[02:04:30.845 --> 02:04:37.171]  I learned a lot from this book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:37.171 --> 02:04:40.935]  Get your orders in and start shipping the 21st of this month, maybe even earlier.
[02:04:40.935 --> 02:04:43.898]  The books are coming early next week.
[02:04:44.418 --> 02:04:48.762]  So, they've been printed right now, about to ship out to us from the printer.
[02:04:48.762 --> 02:04:51.564]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[02:04:51.564 --> 02:04:53.086]  Available at InfoWars.com.

[02:04:55.768 --> 02:04:57.289]  Mark Dice, great talking to you.
[02:04:57.289 --> 02:05:00.352]  Talk to you again next week to hear about how the radio bomb went.
[02:05:00.692 --> 02:05:04.533]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:05:04.533 --> 02:05:08.794]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.

[02:05:13.715 --> 02:05:19.437]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:05:19.437 --> 02:05:26.459]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:05:29.225 --> 02:05:34.749]  I'm looking for America.
[02:05:34.749 --> 02:05:36.390]  Wear American and be proud.

[02:05:38.512 --> 02:05:43.515]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:05:43.515 --> 02:05:47.658]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:05:55.197 --> 02:05:59.769]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:06:00.387 --> 02:06:04.930]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:05.850]  Number 1.
[02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:09.273]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.273 --> 02:06:10.133]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.133 --> 02:06:15.036]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.036 --> 02:06:15.777]  It's true.
[02:06:15.777 --> 02:06:20.640]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.480]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:25.063]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.063 --> 02:06:28.765]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.965 --> 02:06:29.766]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.766 --> 02:06:32.530]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.530 --> 02:06:36.194]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.194 --> 02:06:36.995]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.995 --> 02:06:41.141]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.141 --> 02:06:45.907]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:08:21.550 --> 02:08:23.291]  I come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:23.291 --> 02:08:25.812]  for two hours with an abbreviated transmission.
[02:08:25.812 --> 02:08:31.534]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:31.534 --> 02:08:35.616]  We're launching the invasion of Twitter today.
[02:08:35.616 --> 02:08:37.717]  One of the few areas we haven't dominated on the web.
[02:08:38.397 --> 02:08:45.466]  We've now on one YouTube channel, to be technical, reached 90 million views on our other six channels and several other auxiliaries.
[02:08:45.466 --> 02:08:50.112]  It's over 300 million views on our own channels just in the last two and a half years.
[02:08:50.112 --> 02:08:54.257]  300 million views on YouTube.
[02:08:54.257 --> 02:08:55.639]  We are dominating YouTube.
[02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.261]  We are dominating Google Analytics.
[02:08:58.261 --> 02:09:05.544]  We are dominating so many facets, but I have really never promoted Twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:09:05.544 --> 02:09:06.404]  Please follow us there.
[02:09:06.404 --> 02:09:12.707]  We're going to start putting more photos, videos, announcements exclusive, because I also need this as an info weapon.
[02:09:12.707 --> 02:09:16.688]  Like if I'm out of a protest or demonstration, something's happening, I'm going to start tweeting myself.
[02:09:16.688 --> 02:09:18.369]  I do sometimes, you know, a lot.
[02:09:18.989 --> 02:09:19.810]  I've got something I can do.
[02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:21.671]  I'm driving through traffic at a red light.
[02:09:21.671 --> 02:09:24.813]  I'm going to really start hammering it out there and making announcements.
[02:09:24.813 --> 02:09:28.295]  So, twitter.com forward slash RealAlexJones.
[02:09:28.295 --> 02:09:29.436]  And I've got some of the Twitters here.
[02:09:29.436 --> 02:09:30.516]  We're about to go to Bob Chapman.
[02:09:30.516 --> 02:09:33.618]  It says, Alex Jones, I've been listening to you every day for the past three years.
[02:09:33.618 --> 02:09:34.479]  Thank you.
[02:09:34.479 --> 02:09:36.920]  That's from Vicky1557.
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.322]  Here's another one.
[02:09:39.322 --> 02:09:40.683]  Great to see you here, Alex.
[02:09:40.683 --> 02:09:41.983]  Love you and your videos.
[02:09:41.983 --> 02:09:43.144]  Hubby and I are huge fans.
[02:09:43.144 --> 02:09:43.985]  Keep up the good work.
[02:09:44.685 --> 02:09:54.407]  We're going to take a few questions on the economy, on gold, on the open announcements of the death of the dollar in the Wall Street Journal and Time Magazine yesterday.
[02:09:54.407 --> 02:09:58.668]  We're going to take three or four questions from Twitter at Alex Jones.
[02:10:10.290 --> 02:10:14.451]  Twitter account twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones.
[02:10:14.451 --> 02:10:16.832]  So again, we'll take some of those towards the end of the hour.
[02:10:16.832 --> 02:10:18.973]  I promise you guys remind me to do that.
[02:10:18.973 --> 02:10:19.973]  I got a lot of news here.
[02:10:19.973 --> 02:10:26.755]  I want to cover but going back now into the news that I want to bring up to Bob Chapman first.
[02:10:26.755 --> 02:10:33.978]  This is out of RTE news France wants global wants new global finance system the end of the dollar.
[02:10:33.978 --> 02:10:34.878]  Of course, they're
[02:10:35.678 --> 02:10:37.759]  The finance minister also called for that a month ago.
[02:10:37.759 --> 02:10:39.579]  The Chinese have also called for that.
[02:10:39.579 --> 02:10:41.700]  And the globalists are unified in this.
[02:10:41.700 --> 02:10:50.362]  Our own government is saying it's going to be great, it should happen, and that there's not going to be any problems associated with this, basically, except for some market issues.
[02:10:50.362 --> 02:10:51.923]  Yeah, how do you like a doubling of prices?
[02:10:51.923 --> 02:10:53.983]  How do you like destroying people on fixed incomes?
[02:10:53.983 --> 02:10:58.604]  How do you like the fact we don't have any industry left and won't be able to buy all the slave goods anymore?
[02:10:58.604 --> 02:11:00.305]  Why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[02:11:00.965 --> 02:11:02.747]  That's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:11:02.747 --> 02:11:04.369]  Also, I wanted to talk about this with Bob.
[02:11:04.369 --> 02:11:05.330]  It's such a big deal.
[02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:06.792]  It's been out for a week.
[02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:11.898]  They just announced, yeah, the SPP means we're going to use foreign troops in America, Canada, and Mexico.
[02:11:11.898 --> 02:11:15.282]  This is out of the Ottawa Citizen, one of the biggest national papers in Canada.
[02:11:15.282 --> 02:11:16.063]  Canada, U.S.
[02:11:16.063 --> 02:11:20.027]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies inside each other's nations.
[02:11:20.828 --> 02:11:22.109]  Tells you about this in endgame.
[02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:23.009]  It's in the documents now.
[02:11:23.009 --> 02:11:24.089]  They're rolling it out.
[02:11:24.089 --> 02:11:28.331]  First, oh, US troops at the Winter Olympics last year.
[02:11:28.331 --> 02:11:29.791]  Oh, Canadian troops at NLE09.
[02:11:29.791 --> 02:11:33.533]  Oh, Mexican troops, you know, landing in Florida.
[02:11:33.533 --> 02:11:34.853]  All of this is happening.
[02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:36.074]  It's really happening.
[02:11:36.074 --> 02:11:38.295]  Not red dawn troops coming out of the sky.
[02:11:38.295 --> 02:11:40.395]  Just, oh, the troops help us now.
[02:11:40.395 --> 02:11:41.356]  The foreign troops.
[02:11:41.356 --> 02:11:42.196]  Incredible.
[02:11:42.196 --> 02:11:43.637]  Also, Daily Mail.
[02:11:43.637 --> 02:11:45.337]  Living in no-fly zone an option.
[02:11:45.337 --> 02:11:47.218]  Obama gives strongest indication yet.
[02:11:47.218 --> 02:11:49.479]  US forces may be deployed in Middle East rebellion.
[02:11:50.559 --> 02:11:53.981]  Continuing, Forbes tells you what I told you eight years ago.
[02:11:53.981 --> 02:11:54.442]  Boom!
[02:11:54.442 --> 02:12:01.146]  Today, docs reveal TSA plan for body scanners for pedestrians and train passengers.
[02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:03.388]  Then it's already in local news, they're already doing it.
[02:12:03.388 --> 02:12:17.877]  With huge high-powered systems, having people drive their cars under it, radiating them off the charts above chest x-rays, or MRIs, and with the TSA, with National Guard and others, literally standing around under it being fried.
[02:12:17.877 --> 02:12:19.639]  I mean, this is off the charts insane.
[02:12:20.779 --> 02:12:21.841]  We've got that.
[02:12:21.841 --> 02:12:27.326]  I mean, Bob Chapman, they are trying to just roll all this out like it's no big deal.
[02:12:27.326 --> 02:12:29.989]  I want to get into currencies first with you.
[02:12:29.989 --> 02:12:34.394]  And why do you think they're announcing now that, OK, the death of the dollar is imminent?
[02:12:34.394 --> 02:12:39.419]  The Chinese announced yesterday, by the end of this year, just nine months away.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:51.270]  Hard to believe that much time has already elapsed, nine and a half months away, that they're going to not accept dollars for anything purchased in China, raw goods, finished goods, what that means.
[02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:56.354]  I mean, clearly they're going for the exits and announcing the new Global SDR as the answer.
[02:12:56.354 --> 02:12:59.037]  Bob Chapman, break it down for us.
[02:12:59.037 --> 02:13:04.962]  Well, the Global SDR cannot be used in conjunction with gold.
[02:13:04.962 --> 02:13:06.404]  And most people don't know that.
[02:13:07.223 --> 02:13:20.750]  And I don't think any system that they're going to put together will work without a 25% goal backing, whether it's a group of currencies, quality currencies if you may, if any such thing exists, or with the dollar.
[02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:29.995]  And I don't think people should discount the fact that the dollar could remain the currency of World Reserve.
[02:13:29.995 --> 02:13:33.037]  Now, I think the way that they're going to do this, and I've
[02:13:33.698 --> 02:13:36.379]  Spoken of this on the program many times before.
[02:13:36.379 --> 02:13:37.859]  I think they're going to have a meeting.
[02:13:37.859 --> 02:13:41.580]  They're going to revalue and devalue currencies against each other.
[02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:46.122]  They will have multilateral default.
[02:13:46.122 --> 02:13:47.602]  What percentages, I don't know.
[02:13:47.602 --> 02:13:51.203]  So coordinated default, what the G20's been saying for two years?
[02:13:51.203 --> 02:13:52.503]  Yes.
[02:13:52.503 --> 02:13:57.485]  And my guess is it'll vary from currency to currency or country to country.
[02:13:58.174 --> 02:14:01.535]  The U.S., I'm looking for two-thirds evaluation.
[02:14:01.535 --> 02:14:04.756]  In other words, you'll have 30 cents in each dollar that you've got.
[02:14:04.756 --> 02:14:11.818]  But I think that there's a good chance that they may use the dollar again.
[02:14:11.818 --> 02:14:21.580]  And once that default and devaluation is in place, they would have the dollar back 25% by gold.
[02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:24.601]  Where the gold would come from, they either have it or they can borrow it.
[02:14:25.581 --> 02:14:26.802]  And they would use that again.
[02:14:26.802 --> 02:14:30.663]  And I'm just telling people, don't discount that.
[02:14:30.663 --> 02:14:35.405]  But it'll be a dollar which will not be like the same that we have now.
[02:14:35.405 --> 02:14:39.966]  It'll be a great deal less valuable than it is today.
[02:14:39.966 --> 02:14:43.748]  So that's the way I think they're going to go with this.
[02:14:43.748 --> 02:14:50.570]  Timing, seeing that they're making these kinds of announcements, more will come over the next several months.
[02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:53.511]  They may try this before the end of the year.
[02:14:53.511 --> 02:14:54.692]  But it's hard to call.
[02:14:56.579 --> 02:14:59.980]  Next.
[02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:06.622]  Why do you... I mean, to be specific, though, even if the dollar stays the World Reserve currency, that's in a devalued position.
[02:15:06.622 --> 02:15:08.023]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:15:08.023 --> 02:15:12.664]  And what they're going to do with debt internally, domestically, I do not know.
[02:15:12.664 --> 02:15:17.226]  If they do the right thing, they will write the debt down by the same amount of money.
[02:15:17.226 --> 02:15:23.468]  But who knows what the people behind the scenes and the people on Wall Street want to do.
[02:15:23.468 --> 02:15:26.029]  I tell people, continue to pay your bills normally.
[02:15:26.505 --> 02:15:30.991]  And take all of the money that you can and put it in gold and silver related assets.
[02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:43.486]  And as all these things transpire, those will go off and up in value and offset any losses that you'll have in the dollar or perhaps any unfortunate incidences that you may have with debt.
[02:15:45.416 --> 02:15:49.439]  Okay, now, this is a question within a question.
[02:15:49.439 --> 02:15:56.565]  Suddenly, USA Today, yesterday, came out and said, yes, we're chemtrailing you to save the Earth from global warming.
[02:15:56.565 --> 02:16:02.209]  Yes, we're having jets with stuff added to fuel, spraying chemicals in the atmosphere.
[02:16:02.209 --> 02:16:08.694]  The Ottawa citizen and others are saying, yes, the North American Union's real.
[02:16:08.694 --> 02:16:11.517]  Yes, we're going to use foreign troops in each other's countries.
[02:16:12.961 --> 02:16:13.741]  It's very simple.
[02:16:13.741 --> 02:16:16.562]  You and other people like you on radio
[02:16:40.729 --> 02:16:47.714]  As well as in the internet, have forced them to move forward and come completely into the open.
[02:16:47.714 --> 02:16:48.815]  They don't have any choice.
[02:16:48.815 --> 02:16:53.379]  You go back to the Brzezinski speech of some three years ago.
[02:16:53.379 --> 02:16:56.981]  And that's how fast time passes.
[02:16:56.981 --> 02:17:00.304]  And he said, look, you know, these people are hot on our tail.
[02:17:00.304 --> 02:17:01.565]  They know what we're doing.
[02:17:01.565 --> 02:17:02.485]  They're exposing it.
[02:17:02.485 --> 02:17:04.167]  We're going to move fast.
[02:17:04.167 --> 02:17:04.547]  And they are.
[02:17:04.547 --> 02:17:06.949]  And they're going to make a lot of mistakes.
[02:17:06.949 --> 02:17:09.971]  But that's why they're doing what they're doing and why they're coming into the open.
[02:17:14.537 --> 02:17:19.043]  Bob, you believe and I believe that history is clear that we have a chance to win.
[02:17:19.043 --> 02:17:26.512]  But how do we get the general public to realize, not just awaken, but realize how much power they've really got?
[02:17:26.512 --> 02:17:30.457]  Well I think the process is being set up and that process is that
[02:17:31.613 --> 02:17:39.358]  Everybody will be financially and economically, perhaps with the exception of people with gold-related assets, they'll be on their knees.
[02:17:39.358 --> 02:17:48.363]  And they'll be forcing them, if you want food, you want extended unemployment benefits, food stamps, you gotta join the New World Order, in general.
[02:17:48.363 --> 02:17:50.944]  And that's the way that I think that they intend to do that.
[02:17:50.944 --> 02:17:58.549]  But at the same time, when they make that move and the people are in that kind of a position, a lot of them are going to say, no, I don't want to do that.
[02:17:59.494 --> 02:18:04.076]  And a lot of other people will follow them, and you could have revolution.
[02:18:04.076 --> 02:18:05.917]  Well, that's what the globalists always do.
[02:18:05.917 --> 02:18:07.557]  It's their tried-and-trusted divide-and-conquer.
[02:18:07.557 --> 02:18:11.639]  They get half the public on welfare or dependent on government contracts.
[02:18:11.639 --> 02:18:26.285]  The bankers implode the economy, cut off the money themselves, and then use the dispossessed, hungry masses as a weapon to be pointed at what's left for the middle class and people that are awake and aware who are actually trying to save the country.
[02:18:26.285 --> 02:18:26.845]  And that's true.
[02:18:28.181 --> 02:18:34.767]  And it's not only that, it's all the matinations that go on in between.
[02:18:34.767 --> 02:18:39.591]  We've been discussing now for six weeks what's going on in the Middle East.
[02:18:39.591 --> 02:18:49.899]  And I said first on this program that I felt it was a distraction from the financial and economic problems of the United States, Great Britain, and Europe.
[02:18:49.899 --> 02:18:56.224]  And then we found out shortly thereafter that Frank Wisner had, and he's a former high official in the
[02:18:58.677 --> 02:19:27.928]  in the Central Intelligence Agency had visited Mr. Mubarak about a month before this all happened and as far as I'm concerned he must have given him marching orders and I think that the end result of what's going on in the Middle East and North Africa now is to keep nations neutralized in some form of disquiet or even chaotic condition
[02:19:28.857 --> 02:19:35.680]  So that no one can assist Iran if the government's going to go after Iran.
[02:19:35.680 --> 02:19:39.602]  When we come back, Bob, I want to get into the TSA.
[02:19:39.602 --> 02:19:43.564]  I want to get into gold, silver, oil, commodities.
[02:19:43.564 --> 02:19:46.286]  Your predictions, again, coming true right on time.
[02:19:46.286 --> 02:19:48.166]  Where you see gold and silver going.
[02:19:48.166 --> 02:19:50.508]  Then we're going to open the phones up for everybody that's holding.
[02:19:50.508 --> 02:19:54.489]  The toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.

[02:20:55.086 --> 02:21:03.035]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:21:03.035 --> 02:21:05.338]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:21:05.338 --> 02:21:08.541]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.541 --> 02:21:13.287]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.647 --> 02:21:18.150]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:20.612]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.612 --> 02:21:23.394]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.394 --> 02:21:26.296]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.296 --> 02:21:33.902]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.232 --> 02:21:39.634]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.634 --> 02:21:42.475]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.475 --> 02:21:46.177]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:46.177 --> 02:21:47.237]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.237 --> 02:21:48.578]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.578 --> 02:21:50.078]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.305 --> 02:22:01.326]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:01.326 --> 02:22:06.870]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:07.390]  I get it.
[02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:17.017]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:17.017 --> 02:22:18.438]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:18.438 --> 02:22:26.905]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:30.147]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:30.287 --> 02:22:34.550]  For the realist, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:36.151]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:36.151 --> 02:22:40.114]  dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.114 --> 02:22:43.937]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:43.937 --> 02:22:44.838]  You should, too.
[02:22:44.838 --> 02:22:45.999]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:45.999 --> 02:22:49.301]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:49.301 --> 02:22:49.361]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.361 --> 02:22:49.702]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.702 --> 02:22:49.882]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:01.567 --> 02:23:02.788]  This is not a drill.
[02:23:02.788 --> 02:23:05.311]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:23:05.311 --> 02:23:07.212]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:23:07.212 --> 02:23:14.419]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:23:14.419 --> 02:23:18.823]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:24.969]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the
[02:23:25.069 --> 02:23:26.170]  Perfect hiding place.
[02:23:26.170 --> 02:23:29.312]  As well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:23:29.312 --> 02:23:30.933]  Under any circumstance.
[02:23:30.933 --> 02:23:38.179]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:23:38.179 --> 02:23:38.879]  But listen up.
[02:23:38.879 --> 02:23:45.124]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:23:45.124 --> 02:23:46.965]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:23:46.965 --> 02:23:49.127]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[02:23:49.127 --> 02:23:49.627]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[02:23:49.627 --> 02:23:50.828]  Before they come for your guns.
[02:23:54.631 --> 02:23:56.874]  HideYourGuns.com right now!
[02:24:07.251 --> 02:24:15.920]  I've got a whole cornucopia of important news we want to pick Bob Chapman's intellect on.
[02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:24.529]  But as I told you, we're going to start really pushing twitter.com forward slash realalexjones with your daily questions, inside info for Twitter followers.
[02:24:25.109 --> 02:24:29.712]  And we're trying to make it the number one search term today, Alex Jones Twitter, so please put that in Google.
[02:24:29.712 --> 02:24:31.854]  Over and over again, I want to salute all of you that are doing that.
[02:24:31.854 --> 02:24:33.755]  I think this is going to be an important tool.
[02:24:33.755 --> 02:24:37.297]  We want to dominate that like we've dominated everything else.
[02:24:37.297 --> 02:24:44.102]  I've got a few questions here, though, that came in off of Twitter, several for Bob Chapman, a whole bunch for me.
[02:24:44.102 --> 02:24:48.845]  It goes on to say, Alex, what is your favorite anti-tyranny quote?
[02:24:48.845 --> 02:24:52.527]  JBYRDstreet asked that question.
[02:24:56.450 --> 02:25:01.954]  Altered of God, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of men, Thomas Jefferson.
[02:25:01.954 --> 02:25:03.595]  In fact, guys, can you queue up that liner?
[02:25:03.595 --> 02:25:09.058]  I think we have it dry just with the Thomas Jefferson, because I think I paraphrased it a bit there.
[02:25:09.058 --> 02:25:13.181]  And while they're getting that queued up, Bob, we have a couple questions here for you.
[02:25:13.181 --> 02:25:15.623]  Bob Chapman, they asked the question.
[02:25:16.749 --> 02:25:20.430]  It was actually HMHMAA asked me about my favorite quote.
[02:25:20.430 --> 02:25:25.571]  It was Jaybirdstreet that asked Bob Chapman, how would you hold gold or silver?
[02:25:25.571 --> 02:25:28.271]  Proofs, uncirculated, or bars?
[02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:34.152]  And then we have another question here saying, is it possible to dissolve the Federal Reserve?
[02:25:34.152 --> 02:25:37.533]  So Bob, will you take both those questions please?
[02:25:37.533 --> 02:25:44.334]  Well, my favorite is bullion coins, both in silver and in gold.
[02:25:45.494 --> 02:25:53.840]  Occasionally, Mint State graded numismatic coins, depending upon the pricing structure.
[02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:59.104]  But that's where most of what I have is.
[02:25:59.104 --> 02:26:06.809]  The other part of the question was... Well, they asked the question, you know, can we abolish the Federal Reserve?
[02:26:06.809 --> 02:26:07.790]  That's it.
[02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:09.831]  It's possible, but I don't think it's probable.
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:17.222]  Uh, that is the key to their control of the American people and probably the finances of the world.
[02:26:17.222 --> 02:26:19.683]  Yeah, that's dropping the coin into the crack of doom in Mordor.
[02:26:19.683 --> 02:26:21.783]  That's the big win.
[02:26:21.783 --> 02:26:26.645]  Yeah, and that's going to be very, very difficult, uh, because they bought Congress.
[02:26:26.645 --> 02:26:28.965]  They own 95% of it.
[02:26:28.965 --> 02:26:37.368]  And so unless we're successful in removing the incumbents from Congress and getting people in there who will vote properly on our behalf,
[02:26:37.972 --> 02:26:39.413]  Then nothing's going to happen.
[02:26:39.413 --> 02:26:42.115]  We showed a revolution.
[02:26:42.115 --> 02:26:46.138]  Let's go ahead and play that quote.
[02:26:46.138 --> 02:26:55.665]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:26:55.665 --> 02:26:57.226]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:26:57.226 --> 02:27:00.908]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:02.009 --> 02:27:10.094]  Okay, so there you go there's my favorite quote Bob the TSA there's now no doubt it's in Forbes It's in AP.
[02:27:10.094 --> 02:27:12.256]  They are running checkpoints all over the country.
[02:27:12.256 --> 02:27:24.684]  They are sticking hands-down pants They are driving people under high-powered radiation machines while the idiot local trained police under TSA control Stand around roasting scanning hundreds of cars.
[02:27:24.684 --> 02:27:26.105]  I mean it's like they know that
[02:27:26.765 --> 02:27:29.546]  Something's not going to be here in the future or something.
[02:27:29.546 --> 02:27:31.687]  Frying all their own minions.
[02:27:31.687 --> 02:27:35.369]  I mean, the globalists are just so brazen, Bob.
[02:27:35.369 --> 02:27:40.410]  Well, frying their minions is not important to them, as we know.
[02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:44.492]  They'd like to get rid of 60-80% of the people on the planet anyway.
[02:27:44.492 --> 02:27:47.953]  And to them, they'll eventually be useless eaters.
[02:27:47.953 --> 02:27:52.595]  But there's one aspect that we haven't talked about here.
[02:27:52.595 --> 02:27:54.296]  And that is, now they want to
[02:27:55.299 --> 02:27:59.302]  Check the genetic design of people while they're doing this process.
[02:27:59.302 --> 02:27:59.883]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:27:59.883 --> 02:28:01.044]  It's always worse than I say.
[02:28:01.044 --> 02:28:01.684]  That's right.
[02:28:01.684 --> 02:28:04.947]  They're going to take a cheek swab of your tissue now when you fly.
[02:28:04.947 --> 02:28:06.989]  Isn't that nice?
[02:28:06.989 --> 02:28:08.170]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:16.616]  Setting the precedent to get in our bodies, as I've been saying, with the federal funds to have police take blood at warrantless checkpoints.
[02:28:16.616 --> 02:28:17.537]  That's right.
[02:28:17.537 --> 02:28:20.159]  And that's another one I didn't even think of.
[02:28:20.159 --> 02:28:23.302]  I mean, they are just pushing and pushing and pushing.
[02:28:24.145 --> 02:28:25.327]  And we've got to push back.
[02:28:25.327 --> 02:28:32.436]  We've got to bring it to the attention of the general public.
[02:28:32.436 --> 02:28:33.737]  You don't have to put up with this.
[02:28:33.737 --> 02:28:34.979]  You shouldn't have to put up with this.
[02:28:35.945 --> 02:28:38.386]  And complain to your congressmen and senators.
[02:28:38.386 --> 02:28:42.149]  Complain to the local law enforcement if they're involved in it.
[02:28:42.149 --> 02:28:43.049]  Well, that's the good news.
[02:28:43.049 --> 02:28:45.150]  All over the country, states are passing laws.
[02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.370]  Why?
[02:28:45.370 --> 02:28:45.851]  I don't know.
[02:28:45.851 --> 02:28:51.554]  It's already illegal for TSA to stick their hands down your pants, or even on the outside, on your genitals.
[02:28:51.554 --> 02:28:54.676]  But they're saying, we're going to arrest you, TSA, if you do this.
[02:28:54.676 --> 02:28:56.457]  So the states are bucking up and saying no.
[02:28:58.075 --> 02:29:11.814]  Well, I think that's fantastic and I hope they pass it quickly, especially in large states like New York, California, Illinois, Texas, you know, and Georgia where you get a lot of plane traffic.
[02:29:11.814 --> 02:29:12.976]  You know, one of the things that
[02:29:14.438 --> 02:29:34.719]  It hasn't brought out, I don't think it's brought out in the program, and that is what they, and I don't know what group this is, I'll call it Homeland Security, they are checking people getting on and off planes now, and they have dogs, and the dogs identify certain things, like gold, silver, money, etc.
[02:29:36.164 --> 02:29:44.327]  And if the dog gives a loud bark, I guess, they grab this person out of line and find out what they're carrying.
[02:29:44.327 --> 02:29:47.569]  So that's another thing that you have to watch out for.
[02:29:47.569 --> 02:29:48.549]  Absolutely, Bob.
[02:29:48.549 --> 02:29:51.150]  Let's come back, take phone calls, get into the economy.
[02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:52.551]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.551 --> 02:29:55.072]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.072 --> 02:29:57.773]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.119 --> 02:30:06.142]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.142 --> 02:30:09.385]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.385 --> 02:30:14.189]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:14.189 --> 02:30:20.575]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.575 --> 02:30:22.817]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.357 --> 02:30:23.657]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:23.657 --> 02:30:24.178]  Bernanke?
[02:30:24.178 --> 02:30:24.838]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:24.838 --> 02:30:25.939]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:25.939 --> 02:30:28.361]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.253 --> 02:30:44.395]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:30:44.395 --> 02:30:49.541]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.541 --> 02:30:58.651]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:04.613]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:31:04.613 --> 02:31:05.914]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:31:05.914 --> 02:31:10.318]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:31:10.318 --> 02:31:16.264]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:31:16.264 --> 02:31:18.405]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:31:18.405 --> 02:31:21.088]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:31:21.428 --> 02:31:27.934]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:27.934 --> 02:31:30.136]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:31:30.136 --> 02:31:35.481]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:31:35.481 --> 02:31:40.446]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:31:40.746 --> 02:31:46.127]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:31:46.127 --> 02:31:49.328]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:31:49.328 --> 02:31:52.329]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:52.329 --> 02:31:53.089]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.391 --> 02:32:01.552]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:01.552 --> 02:32:08.494]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.494 --> 02:32:11.055]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.055 --> 02:32:16.436]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.436 --> 02:32:19.477]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.477 --> 02:32:21.538]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:21.778 --> 02:32:28.042]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.042 --> 02:32:31.424]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.424 --> 02:32:37.207]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.207 --> 02:32:38.848]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:38.848 --> 02:32:40.129]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.129 --> 02:32:42.811]  You should at least watch this free video online today.

[02:35:03.938 --> 02:35:06.479]  They got it all at purewaterfreedom.com.
[02:35:06.479 --> 02:35:07.680]  Uh, going back to Bob.
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:12.841]  Bob, I've been asking the questions here, and I got one more point on the TSA that I want you to hit on anything else you think's important.
[02:35:12.841 --> 02:35:23.485]  I don't want to go to calls and go back in the economy, but, uh, Aaron ran in here and said, Alex, it's worse than taking DNA at the airport and at checkpoints under TSA, Total Tentament Violation.
[02:35:23.485 --> 02:35:25.885]  It's worse than them rolling it out and admitting it.
[02:35:25.885 --> 02:35:27.406]  He gave me USA Today.
[02:35:28.974 --> 02:35:30.696]  This just came out this morning.
[02:35:30.696 --> 02:35:34.241]  Homeland Security looked into covert body scans.
[02:35:34.241 --> 02:35:37.044]  They've decided to go with public ones on the street.
[02:35:37.044 --> 02:35:39.968]  Mobile trucks, vans, big scanners you drive under.
[02:35:39.968 --> 02:35:42.291]  Just frying you, shooting through metal.
[02:35:42.291 --> 02:35:45.995]  Dwarfing a regular chest x-ray that doesn't go through thick metal.
[02:35:45.995 --> 02:35:47.257]  I mean, this is blasting you.
[02:35:48.809 --> 02:35:54.918]  Now they've announced this week that they want to go ahead and have chest x-ray type whole body deals in Australia and in the US.
[02:35:54.918 --> 02:36:00.587]  Now they're announcing that they're looking at it being secret and not letting you know when you drive under it on the highway.
[02:36:00.587 --> 02:36:02.549]  But they decided to go ahead and just do it to you.
[02:36:02.549 --> 02:36:03.871]  I mean, this is assault, Bob!
[02:36:05.252 --> 02:36:07.433]  They're going to the Austin Airport where I live.
[02:36:07.433 --> 02:36:09.014]  Now I'll be driving down the highway.
[02:36:09.014 --> 02:36:11.435]  I'll know what an X-ray array is.
[02:36:11.435 --> 02:36:12.676]  I can't drive under it.
[02:36:12.676 --> 02:36:16.278]  They've put metal barriers up all over Texas so I can't go around it.
[02:36:16.278 --> 02:36:18.679]  And I've got to submit to high-power radiation?
[02:36:18.679 --> 02:36:23.461]  I mean, this is out of a science fiction joke!
[02:36:23.461 --> 02:36:27.983]  Well, what they want to do, I think, is not only get information on people,
[02:36:28.587 --> 02:36:45.317]  But I think it's a form of getting rid of people because some people may be or may be in a position where they are easily subject to disease from using these machines like cancer.
[02:36:45.317 --> 02:36:52.341]  Well the license plate reader will know you're coming and when Alex Jones drives under it the computer hits it with 20 times the power.
[02:36:52.341 --> 02:36:53.342]  Could very well be.
[02:36:53.342 --> 02:36:55.703]  These are public fry grids they're putting in.
[02:36:59.654 --> 02:37:03.072]  I don't know what the answer is to that other than people demonstrating.
[02:37:04.275 --> 02:37:05.415]  Man, these people are terrorists.
[02:37:05.415 --> 02:37:06.895]  Congress doesn't want to do anything.
[02:37:06.895 --> 02:37:08.556]  Look, the TSA are terrorists.
[02:37:08.556 --> 02:37:10.296]  Homeland Security are terrorists.
[02:37:10.296 --> 02:37:11.616]  They carried out 9-11.
[02:37:11.616 --> 02:37:13.257]  FEMA is involved.
[02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:16.337]  And they are now publicly putting public friars in.
[02:37:16.337 --> 02:37:20.338]  I mean, it's just, it's unspeakable, Bob.
[02:37:20.338 --> 02:37:21.278]  It's like a joke.
[02:37:21.278 --> 02:37:23.899]  It's like a satire of a tyranny.
[02:37:23.899 --> 02:37:31.600]  Imagine a futuristic world where they have you drive under high-powered radiation and have the cops stand around it with no shielding.
[02:37:38.467 --> 02:37:47.798]  Well, I think a good place to start would be with law enforcement saying, you know what they're doing to you, and you're probably going to be dead within two to three years, if not sooner.
[02:37:48.917 --> 02:37:52.221]  I think maybe you ought to tell these people you don't want to do that.
[02:37:52.221 --> 02:37:55.846]  And by the way, the troops detonated hundreds of chemical weapons bunkers.
[02:37:55.846 --> 02:37:58.249]  The alarms all went off in 1991.
[02:37:58.249 --> 02:38:00.292]  Thousands and thousands of the troops died.
[02:38:00.292 --> 02:38:01.653]  Hundreds of thousands ill.
[02:38:01.653 --> 02:38:04.036]  The major universities did brain stem studies.
[02:38:04.036 --> 02:38:05.658]  They were full of sarin nerve gas.
[02:38:05.658 --> 02:38:06.540]  They didn't give you treatment.
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.762]  Last year they announced they've secretly stolen the death benefits of all the troops.
[02:38:10.762 --> 02:38:11.943]  Bloomberg, AP.
[02:38:11.943 --> 02:38:14.284]  I mean, get it through your heads, cops and military.
[02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:16.766]  The globalists hate you even more than they hate us.
[02:38:16.766 --> 02:38:17.946]  Get it through your head.
[02:38:17.946 --> 02:38:21.368]  You're on our team even if you don't know it.
[02:38:21.368 --> 02:38:24.830]  And whether you like it or not.
[02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:25.831]  I can't believe it, Bob.
[02:38:25.831 --> 02:38:27.372]  I can't believe it.
[02:38:27.372 --> 02:38:28.492]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[02:38:28.492 --> 02:38:30.413]  Let's go to some phone calls here.
[02:38:30.413 --> 02:38:31.734]  Making me sick.
[02:38:31.734 --> 02:38:33.155]  Chris in New Hampshire, you're on the air.
[02:38:34.622 --> 02:38:37.946]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:38:37.946 --> 02:38:45.033]  I just got a question for Bob and one for you Alex.
[02:38:45.033 --> 02:38:56.466]  I got disabled at a young age and obviously I'm on social security disability and with everything going on and the dollar crashing I've been trying to take the bull by the horns and
[02:38:57.495 --> 02:39:24.433]  I'm thinking about getting some silver, putting it aside, um, because I got disabled at such a young age, didn't really prepare for my future, and uh, if I accumulate silver and try to get some gold, um, if they do go this one world currency, how do I exchange... Whenever the inflation has been, you exchange it for the currency of your choice, and then that stops the inflation under the classical model.
[02:39:24.433 --> 02:39:26.074]  Okay, now... That's a perfect answer.
[02:39:27.597 --> 02:39:34.679]  Now, would it be a good idea for me to, you know, invest a little bit in silver because of the situation that I am in?
[02:39:34.679 --> 02:39:39.541]  Because, you know, I've been trying to save paper money, but I've been really getting informed.
[02:39:39.541 --> 02:39:45.222]  I've been a listener for now for two years, and I've really been watching how the world events have been going on here.
[02:39:45.222 --> 02:39:47.243]  And I'm not a paranoid type, but...
[02:39:47.890 --> 02:39:50.151]  I just need to have a little bit of a direction.
[02:39:50.151 --> 02:40:03.175]  I mean, the best scenario... Well, you should never pay more than 1 or 2 percent above spot for gold or silver, and I go for junk or I go for bullion that is, quite frankly, semi-numismatic.
[02:40:03.175 --> 02:40:12.518]  I mean, it has a collector value, but if you go to places like Midas, you can get collector coins at bullion prices because Ted Anderson is hyper-competitive.
[02:40:12.518 --> 02:40:13.558]  Chris, I appreciate your call.
[02:40:14.418 --> 02:40:21.163]  Um, but if you really don't have a lot of money, the biggest thing is a little bit of emergency storable food, firearms, and family and friends you can trust.
[02:40:21.163 --> 02:40:22.644]  Uh, let's talk to Tony in Maryland.
[02:40:22.644 --> 02:40:24.305]  Tony, you're on the air.
[02:40:24.305 --> 02:40:25.305]  Hey, what's going on Alex?
[02:40:25.305 --> 02:40:26.846]  It looks like I won the lottery.
[02:40:26.846 --> 02:40:28.427]  Hey, um, I, I have a question for you.
[02:40:28.427 --> 02:40:34.491]  Actually, it's more, um, one of the best movies you ever made was on a comprehensive annual financial reports, but I found one actually better.
[02:40:34.491 --> 02:40:36.513]  It's by a lady named Mary Croft.
[02:40:36.513 --> 02:40:43.057]  It's called, um, How I Clubber Every Bureaucratic Cash Compensatory, Cash Compensatory Agency No Demand.
[02:40:43.621 --> 02:40:46.924]  It's definitely a book to check out and I've sent it to your listeners already or to your email.
[02:40:46.924 --> 02:40:49.446]  Listen, Tony, that's awesome, but your phone's breaking up a bit.
[02:40:49.446 --> 02:40:52.709]  Do you have a question or comment for Bob Chapman?
[02:40:52.709 --> 02:40:54.531]  Um, no, that's all.
[02:40:54.531 --> 02:40:55.031]  Anything else?
[02:40:55.031 --> 02:40:58.294]  Because I can hear a little bit better now.
[02:40:58.294 --> 02:41:02.758]  I just want you to check out the Mary Croft book.
[02:41:02.758 --> 02:41:05.120]  If you go to google.com, check out Mary Croft.
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:07.842]  The information will definitely bring the criminal federal government down.
[02:41:07.842 --> 02:41:09.524]  Okay, how do you say her last name again?
[02:41:10.416 --> 02:41:12.937]  It seems to be generally hidden.
[02:41:12.937 --> 02:41:14.937]  The municipalities won't talk about it.
[02:41:14.937 --> 02:41:16.478]  It can't get a hearing anywhere.
[02:41:16.478 --> 02:41:17.198]  People don't believe it.
[02:41:39.438 --> 02:41:44.463]  It's a very hard sell, but it seems to be there.
[02:41:44.463 --> 02:41:45.864]  Oh, it's there.
[02:41:45.864 --> 02:41:54.372]  And by the way, we've uploaded annual comprehensive financial reports exposed to the InfoWarrior Director Channel that we have, folks.
[02:41:54.372 --> 02:41:58.976]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here, John?
[02:41:58.976 --> 02:41:59.757]  Adam in California.
[02:41:59.757 --> 02:42:01.899]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:42:01.899 --> 02:42:02.359]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:02.359 --> 02:42:03.060]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:42:04.261 --> 02:42:15.353]  I wanted to talk with you really quickly about the globalist agenda and how it pertains to the geopolitical situation in the Middle East and how the events are being controlled, at least from the Muslim perspective.
[02:42:16.693 --> 02:42:29.941]  I know Glenn Beck usually bites a lot of your style, takes a lot of your talking points, but one thing that he's spoken about that you really haven't is the Imam Mahdi situation and how the religious events in the Middle East are being controlled.
[02:42:29.941 --> 02:42:45.670]  No, a lot of Muslims do think it's the end of the world as well, just like Christians do, and that is, even if it was true, it's a manipulation to get people to give in and not fight tyranny because it's all about to end anyways, and there's major foundation globalist funding in the last 150 years pushing that.
[02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:46.210]  Bob Chapman?
[02:42:47.794 --> 02:42:49.115]  I agree.
[02:42:49.115 --> 02:43:07.205]  And some of the elements under the surface, one must remember, and if you don't know it now you will, that the Muslim Brotherhood was funded in the 1920s by MI6 and that was taken up by the CIA after its formation in the late 40s.
[02:43:07.205 --> 02:43:09.386]  And that's not debated by the way.
[02:43:09.386 --> 02:43:09.846]  What's that?
[02:43:09.846 --> 02:43:10.607]  That's not debated.
[02:43:12.217 --> 02:43:13.218]  That's a public fact.
[02:43:13.218 --> 02:43:16.761]  Because I have people sending me emails saying, you're making that up.
[02:43:16.761 --> 02:43:18.122]  Now you're saying the Muslims are bad.
[02:43:18.122 --> 02:43:23.325]  No, this group on record is there to stir stuff up to turn that place into a fire pit.
[02:43:23.325 --> 02:43:23.926]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:25.051 --> 02:43:26.632]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:43:26.632 --> 02:43:35.497]  And I always cite the two divisions that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem sent to the Second World War to fight with Germany against the Russians.
[02:43:35.497 --> 02:43:45.062]  So this is a quasi-fascistic organization that many, many Muslims probably do not know what their agenda is and who controls them.
[02:43:47.182 --> 02:43:48.063]  Well said, Bob.
[02:43:48.063 --> 02:43:55.791]  Now, I want to shift gears now, and then we'll come back in the final segment and talk to Tracy, Frank, and a few others with Bob Chapman of TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:43:55.791 --> 02:44:01.257]  But in the five minutes we've got before break, gold, silver are exploding.
[02:44:01.257 --> 02:44:02.418]  Oil is exploding.
[02:44:02.418 --> 02:44:03.299]  All of this predicted.
[02:44:03.299 --> 02:44:04.440]  You got to hand it to Lindsey Williams.
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:06.001]  You got to hand it to Bob Chapman.
[02:44:06.001 --> 02:44:08.084]  But we know there's dollar devaluation happening.
[02:44:08.784 --> 02:44:17.575]  So that's going to continue to drive this, but I wanted to bring Ted Anderson in to tell us today's gold and silver prices and then we'll get Bob's take on these prices, how good they are.
[02:44:17.575 --> 02:44:18.136]  Ted Anderson.
[02:44:18.863 --> 02:44:20.424]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:44:20.424 --> 02:44:24.228]  I can tell you right now, goal is at 1433.40 at the high today.
[02:44:24.228 --> 02:44:28.551]  Silver went over $35 an ounce, $35.45 today.
[02:44:28.551 --> 02:44:31.393]  Just, you know, like you said, going up like a rocket ship.
[02:44:31.393 --> 02:44:32.975]  Dollars dropping.
[02:44:32.975 --> 02:44:37.579]  The Libyan oil thing, I mean, oil over $100 a barrel, $104 a barrel.
[02:44:37.579 --> 02:44:40.361]  What we have right now is I do have your videos.
[02:44:40.361 --> 02:44:43.704]  I had to price them up a little bit because silver's just gone through the roof.
[02:44:44.184 --> 02:44:49.768]  Yeah, so that's special for three silver dollars, $97 with free shipping and three of my films.
[02:44:49.768 --> 02:44:51.489]  That was a $70 discount.
[02:44:51.489 --> 02:44:53.490]  It had to go up because you ran out of those supplies.
[02:44:53.490 --> 02:44:54.651]  This deal's still great.
[02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:55.792]  What's the price today?
[02:44:55.792 --> 02:44:56.873]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[02:44:56.873 --> 02:44:59.975]  Silver's gone up $10 an ounce since I priced those.
[02:44:59.975 --> 02:45:06.599]  That deal should be $30 higher than it was when I priced it at $27 an ounce.
[02:45:06.599 --> 02:45:08.961]  We are currently selling the same thing at $110.
[02:45:08.961 --> 02:45:13.944]  And the reason why I'm holding the price down on this is because I'm just so pleased
[02:45:14.444 --> 02:45:20.848]  That we have thousands, and I'm not talking about hundreds, thousands of people getting your videos right now.
[02:45:20.848 --> 02:45:25.511]  And thousands of people getting silver dollars in their hands, which are going to be money.
[02:45:25.511 --> 02:45:26.412]  I mean, this is the Constitution.
[02:45:26.412 --> 02:45:27.333]  Well, let's be clear then.
[02:45:27.333 --> 02:45:29.814]  At spot, then, the three coins should cost $105.
[02:45:29.814 --> 02:45:34.797]  You're selling it for $110, and the shipping's more than the five.
[02:45:34.797 --> 02:45:41.802]  With three films, Obama, Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame, just as cherries on top to give people out there to wake them up.
[02:45:42.182 --> 02:45:42.482]  It is perfect.
[02:45:42.482 --> 02:45:42.702]  Go get it.
[02:45:42.702 --> 02:45:43.282]  What's silver today?
[02:45:43.282 --> 02:45:44.023]  I know it's up even more.
[02:46:02.506 --> 02:46:04.547]  Yeah, silver went up 3%, over 3%, 3.39%.
[02:46:04.547 --> 02:46:09.309]  Where is it now?
[02:46:09.309 --> 02:46:11.450]  $35.45 was the high, $35.41 currently.
[02:46:11.450 --> 02:46:13.130]  I mean, it is just out of this world.
[02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:15.871]  So to get those at spot, it would actually be over $106.
[02:46:15.871 --> 02:46:21.474]  So you're talking $110 for the three coins, which by the way are semi-numismatic.
[02:46:21.474 --> 02:46:23.735]  Most of these coins are about 100 years old, right Ted?
[02:46:23.735 --> 02:46:24.355]  Yep, they are.
[02:46:24.355 --> 02:46:27.816]  They're old silver dollars that are either 1921 or older.
[02:46:27.816 --> 02:46:29.157]  Some are Morgan, some are Pease.
[02:46:30.698 --> 02:46:31.258]  They're gorgeous.
[02:46:31.258 --> 02:46:33.419]  Most stores, you see them for $40.
[02:46:33.419 --> 02:46:36.261]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, 800-686-237.
[02:46:36.261 --> 02:46:44.547]  You've also got a deal, Ted, where they can get a $159 value, the hard copy or the email, twice a week version of the International Forecaster.
[02:46:44.547 --> 02:46:54.473]  They buy the frank basically at cost, and then you slap down the newsletter, your subscription, either digital or physical, of the International Forecaster on top of that with the frank, correct?
[02:46:54.733 --> 02:46:55.454]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:46:55.454 --> 02:47:01.762]  It's $313 and you do get the full year subscription to the International Forecaster.
[02:47:01.762 --> 02:47:06.207]  I was going to go to that right after Silver because that is just such a great value for gold.
[02:47:06.207 --> 02:47:07.990]  800-686-2237.
[02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:12.455]  Give us a rundown of the Maple Leafs, of the Silver Eagles,
[02:47:13.837 --> 02:47:22.627]  American Eagle Gold, the gorgeous and high demand that you've got just at smoking prices, the Buffalos, the British Sovereigns.
[02:47:22.627 --> 02:47:23.728]  What else do you got?
[02:47:23.728 --> 02:47:27.152]  Just say it's a radio special for Alex Jones, folks, and you'll get the older price.
[02:47:27.152 --> 02:47:28.434]  And how long can you hold these prices?
[02:47:28.854 --> 02:47:31.215]  Well, I'm holding the prices certainly until midnight.
[02:47:31.215 --> 02:47:32.435]  Actually, no, it's Friday.
[02:47:32.435 --> 02:47:33.975]  I'm going to hold it all the way through Sunday.
[02:47:33.975 --> 02:47:34.716]  I don't care.
[02:47:34.716 --> 02:47:36.296]  If you call in, you're going to get it.
[02:47:36.296 --> 02:47:40.857]  And that's if silver opens up at $40 an ounce on Monday.
[02:47:40.857 --> 02:47:43.478]  It's important that you get... So this is good through Monday morning?
[02:47:43.478 --> 02:47:45.558]  Yeah, this will be good through Monday morning.
[02:47:45.558 --> 02:47:50.200]  So all you have to do... Like, for instance, the bags of silver, the survival bags of silver are now $25.60.
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.581]  I mean, at $40 an ounce, that bag is going to be closer to $2,800.
[02:47:56.581 --> 02:48:02.562]  It now takes 25 of today's dime to buy one dime of 1964.
[02:48:02.562 --> 02:48:05.663]  I want to give the number out.
[02:48:05.663 --> 02:48:06.583]  800-686-2237.
[02:48:06.583 --> 02:48:11.604]  There's a whole list of radio specials, folks, but you've got to get them while they're still there.
[02:48:11.604 --> 02:48:16.805]  Ted doesn't do a lost leader where you come in and you want the special deal on the ham or whatever and they're out.
[02:48:17.185 --> 02:48:21.087]  He will go ahead, even if he runs out and has to sell you stuff he got at a higher price.
[02:48:21.087 --> 02:48:21.807]  He will hold it.
[02:48:21.807 --> 02:48:22.988]  You're guaranteed to get it.
[02:48:22.988 --> 02:48:25.329]  And this isn't some gold broker that orders it later.
[02:48:25.329 --> 02:48:32.652]  He has this in his vaults now, ready to ship to you.
[02:48:32.652 --> 02:48:33.593]  800-686-2237.
[02:48:33.593 --> 02:48:34.153]  800-686-2237.
[02:48:34.153 --> 02:48:37.435]  Bob Chapman, briefly, we're gonna come back and take some calls.
[02:48:37.435 --> 02:48:40.456]  Where do you see all of this going?
[02:48:40.456 --> 02:48:42.317]  Where do you see gold and silver going right now?
[02:48:43.331 --> 02:48:47.934]  What's significant was the pullback of yesterday created by the U.S.
[02:48:47.934 --> 02:48:54.818]  government, as usual, and the tremendous turnaround in the ComEx market today to the upside.
[02:48:54.818 --> 02:48:59.461]  I saw gold up as much as $15.10 during the day, and silver, I think, was up about $1.10.
[02:48:59.461 --> 02:49:02.203]  And there's no stopping this.
[02:49:03.058 --> 02:49:04.179]  You've got to be in there.
[02:49:04.179 --> 02:49:06.521]  You've got to be buying these coins.
[02:49:06.521 --> 02:49:08.243]  This has got a long, long way to go.
[02:49:08.243 --> 02:49:09.584]  Where do I think it's going?
[02:49:09.584 --> 02:49:14.769]  In the immediate future, gold can easily go to $1,650, which is about $300 higher than what it is now.
[02:49:17.466 --> 02:49:18.828]  Yeah, look at the 11-year graph!
[02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:37.052]  Look at the 11-year graph on both of them, folks.
[02:49:37.052 --> 02:49:37.873]  800-686-237.
[02:49:37.873 --> 02:49:40.975]  Don't forget, we're doing the search term today, Alex Jones Twitter.
[02:49:40.975 --> 02:49:46.339]  We're invading and assaulting the Twittersphere today, trying to get 100,000 members by next Friday.
[02:49:46.339 --> 02:49:48.480]  Please help us Google that term over and over again.
[02:49:48.480 --> 02:49:49.961]  We are the Infowar.
[02:49:49.961 --> 02:49:50.862]  Alex Jones Twitter.
[02:49:50.862 --> 02:49:51.542]  Google it.
[02:49:51.542 --> 02:49:52.243]  Slam it.
[02:49:52.243 --> 02:49:52.883]  Crush them.
[02:49:52.883 --> 02:49:53.744]  Destroy them.
[02:49:53.744 --> 02:49:54.684]  Annihilate them.
[02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:55.445]  Infowar!
[02:49:57.967 --> 02:50:04.892]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[02:50:04.892 --> 02:50:10.835]  18 years ago, we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[02:50:10.835 --> 02:50:14.598]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[02:50:14.932 --> 02:50:16.733]  My wages were being garnished.
[02:50:16.733 --> 02:50:21.536]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[02:50:21.536 --> 02:50:25.399]  With Zero Debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:50:25.399 --> 02:50:27.460]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:29.661]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:50:58.815 --> 02:51:02.839]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:51:02.839 --> 02:51:06.083]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:51:06.083 --> 02:51:10.888]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:51:10.888 --> 02:51:17.274]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:51:17.274 --> 02:51:19.517]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:51:20.037 --> 02:51:21.177]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:51:21.177 --> 02:51:21.978]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:51:21.978 --> 02:51:24.318]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:51:38.942 --> 02:51:43.325]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:51:43.325 --> 02:51:46.227]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[02:53:06.693 --> 02:53:07.093]  Thanks.
[02:53:07.093 --> 02:53:09.375]  I got one for you, Alex, and one for you, Bob.
[02:53:09.375 --> 02:53:10.676]  A few weeks ago, a group of H.J.P.
[02:53:10.676 --> 02:53:13.738]  Morgan traders that were disgruntled and got fired from H.J.P.
[02:53:13.738 --> 02:53:15.539]  Morgan created a hedge fund group.
[02:53:35.026 --> 02:53:35.366]  We're good.
[02:53:57.220 --> 02:53:59.222]  Well, we are beating them.
[02:53:59.222 --> 02:54:02.405]  They can drive it down for a little while, but it always beats balls back up.
[02:54:02.405 --> 02:54:02.925]  Bob Chapman.
[02:54:02.925 --> 02:54:08.090]  Well, we just saw that yesterday into today, and maybe those players, and I know who the group is,
[02:54:23.298 --> 02:54:25.280]  Uh, have accomplished what they want.
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:26.340]  Let them do that.
[02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:28.682]  Take Morgan to the mat.
[02:54:28.682 --> 02:54:30.864]  Make Morgan default.
[02:54:30.864 --> 02:54:38.769]  And what will happen then is that the trading in silver and gold on the COMEX will almost cease.
[02:54:38.769 --> 02:54:40.991]  And that'll be the end of the paper game.
[02:54:40.991 --> 02:54:47.456]  It'll blow out all the options and the derivatives and it'll destroy SLV and GLD.
[02:54:47.456 --> 02:54:49.217]  And that's what Max Keiser's been hammering.
[02:54:51.866 --> 02:54:54.607]  And Max is absolutely correct.
[02:54:54.607 --> 02:54:56.108]  And that's the way to take you.
[02:54:56.108 --> 02:54:59.030]  You can't let these people intimidate you.
[02:54:59.030 --> 02:55:03.852]  When they bring the battle to you, you go right into their face.
[02:55:03.852 --> 02:55:04.792]  That's the only way to do it.
[02:55:04.792 --> 02:55:05.993]  Tracy, thank you.
[02:55:05.993 --> 02:55:07.874]  Aaron in Nevada, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:55:09.465 --> 02:55:10.446]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:10.446 --> 02:55:12.006]  This is Gonad Radio calling again.
[02:55:12.006 --> 02:55:13.587]  Thank you very much, Bob.
[02:55:13.587 --> 02:55:14.488]  Listen to what Bob said.
[02:55:14.488 --> 02:55:19.430]  When he answered your question, he said demonstrate, and I think that's what we've got to do, and you've been kind of shying away from that.
[02:55:19.430 --> 02:55:21.251]  Second thing I want to say is... Excuse me?
[02:55:21.251 --> 02:55:23.552]  I haven't been against demonstrating.
[02:55:23.552 --> 02:55:24.813]  Okay, okay, fine.
[02:55:24.813 --> 02:55:25.313]  Now hold on.
[02:55:25.313 --> 02:55:26.574]  When did I say don't demonstrate?
[02:55:27.887 --> 02:55:30.129]  I've called you before and you say you don't want to organize.
[02:55:30.129 --> 02:55:33.071]  Take your InfoWar listeners and put them in the street.
[02:55:33.071 --> 02:55:34.812]  Alright, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:55:34.812 --> 02:55:38.094]  I had Max Keiser on saying demonstrate yesterday.
[02:55:38.094 --> 02:55:39.775]  I have Bob Chapman saying it.
[02:55:39.775 --> 02:55:42.077]  I tell people go out and get in the street and be active.
[02:55:42.077 --> 02:55:46.140]  And it's not that I don't mind being criticized, but why is it never legitimate?
[02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:46.480]  Okay?
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.202]  I mean, I'm working 18 hours a day sometimes.
[02:55:50.202 --> 02:55:50.943]  I'm trying.
[02:55:50.943 --> 02:55:52.524]  I can't do everything.
[02:55:52.524 --> 02:55:53.224]  I can't lead.
[02:55:53.224 --> 02:55:54.265]  I'm not all powerful.
[02:55:54.265 --> 02:55:55.166]  Don't you understand that?
[02:55:56.537 --> 02:56:01.224]  Bob Chapman, do you have any comments to what Aaron just said?
[02:56:01.224 --> 02:56:08.513]  Well, I think Aaron is in a position where he would like to see things happen more quickly.
[02:56:08.513 --> 02:56:11.778]  And I can understand that.
[02:56:11.778 --> 02:56:13.841]  But there's a time to do everything.
[02:56:14.597 --> 02:56:21.979]  And we're getting close to the time for major demonstrations, particularly with what just the TSA is doing.
[02:56:21.979 --> 02:56:23.460]  But I've been leading those!
[02:56:23.460 --> 02:56:27.261]  I mean, I never can do enough!
[02:56:27.261 --> 02:56:32.543]  Maybe I'm not going to do this, but maybe you'd be happy if I just quit, because I'm so bad that I work so hard.
[02:56:32.543 --> 02:56:33.443]  I'm the problem.
[02:56:33.443 --> 02:56:34.363]  I'm the evil.
[02:56:34.363 --> 02:56:35.383]  Not the Federal Reserve.
[02:56:35.383 --> 02:56:36.204]  Not the New World Order.
[02:56:36.204 --> 02:56:38.064]  It's all my fault, Bob.
[02:56:38.064 --> 02:56:39.125]  Of course not.
[02:56:39.125 --> 02:56:39.785]  And you know that.
[02:56:40.527 --> 02:56:47.945]  No, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, to quote the Bard, is something that you and I are going to have to put up with.
[02:56:48.736 --> 02:56:57.922]  And that's what we have to live with, and very often when people say things, they mean them, and sometimes they don't, and you gotta take them with a grain of salt.
[02:56:57.922 --> 02:57:00.243]  Yeah, but it's always this moral judgment.
[02:57:00.243 --> 02:57:08.789]  They call it and tell me how I did something wrong, and they're better than me, and that's their big coat of arms in life, is that they showed the big Alex Jones.
[02:57:08.789 --> 02:57:12.111]  And it doesn't hurt me that they're attacking myself, it hurts me for them.
[02:57:12.771 --> 02:57:15.292]  I'm like, you know, tell me where I'm not saying take action.
[02:57:15.292 --> 02:57:16.473]  What are you talking about?
[02:57:16.473 --> 02:57:17.393]  We're all about action.
[02:57:17.393 --> 02:57:18.814]  It's Ax and Jackson.
[02:57:18.814 --> 02:57:19.114]  You know what?
[02:57:19.114 --> 02:57:20.675]  I'm going to overdrive five minutes, Bob.
[02:57:20.675 --> 02:57:23.337]  Stay with us, because I want to go to... I don't want to end on that caller.
[02:57:23.337 --> 02:57:25.858]  I'm going to go to Frank, Chris, and Wolf on the other side.
[02:57:25.858 --> 02:57:26.578]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:57:26.578 --> 02:57:28.159]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:57:28.159 --> 02:57:31.121]  GCNlive.com.

[02:57:32.682 --> 02:57:35.543]  Give Ted a call on those gold and silver deals, or it goes up again.
[02:57:35.543 --> 02:57:35.683]  800-666-8888.
[02:57:35.683 --> 02:57:35.903]  All right?
[02:57:41.144 --> 02:57:45.095]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:57:47.765 --> 02:57:51.968]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:57:51.968 --> 02:57:58.373]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:57:58.373 --> 02:58:05.759]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:58:05.759 --> 02:58:10.622]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:58:15.526 --> 02:58:19.170]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:58:36.726 --> 02:58:37.907]  3-4-0-7-0-9-1.
[02:58:37.907 --> 02:58:46.511]  Visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:58:46.511 --> 02:58:48.592]  Thank you.
[02:58:48.592 --> 02:58:50.113]  Coast to Coast.
[02:58:50.113 --> 02:58:52.174]  Direct from Austin.
[02:58:52.174 --> 02:58:55.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:58:58.991 --> 02:59:05.017]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:59:05.017 --> 02:59:07.559]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:10.743 --> 02:59:11.844]  All right, final segment.
[02:59:11.844 --> 02:59:15.267]  Be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:59:15.267 --> 02:59:19.811]  Again, I don't get mad at people that tell me I'm not doing a good job because I can't handle being criticized.
[02:59:19.811 --> 02:59:22.013]  It's like, man, do it yourself.
[02:59:22.013 --> 02:59:26.617]  I mean, you know, and don't make claims about me that aren't true.
[02:59:26.617 --> 02:59:28.699]  Because for your own self, be true.
[02:59:28.699 --> 02:59:32.823]  Don't just sit there and vomit out, you know, what I need to do.
[02:59:33.463 --> 02:59:35.826]  I mean, you want me to go start a protest?
[02:59:35.826 --> 02:59:37.649]  Maybe I get 20,000 people?
[02:59:37.649 --> 02:59:38.250]  And then what?
[02:59:38.250 --> 02:59:39.271]  You didn't get violent!
[02:59:39.271 --> 02:59:40.292]  We want that!
[02:59:40.292 --> 02:59:41.914]  I'm in the mind!
[02:59:41.914 --> 02:59:45.880]  I'm waking people up in the mind that everything else follows after that.
[02:59:45.880 --> 02:59:47.422]  Who's up next here, John Colwise?
[02:59:50.185 --> 02:59:50.886]  Frank in Canada.
[02:59:50.886 --> 02:59:51.566]  We gotta move quick.
[02:59:51.566 --> 02:59:52.187]  Thanks for calling.
[02:59:52.187 --> 02:59:53.928]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:59:53.928 --> 02:59:54.969]  Hey Alex, thanks a lot.
[02:59:54.969 --> 02:59:56.610]  Thanks for what you're doing.
[02:59:56.610 --> 02:59:58.071]  It is definitely appreciated.
[02:59:58.071 --> 03:00:00.353]  Two questions for both you gentlemen.
[03:00:00.353 --> 03:00:04.677]  Just one question with regards to the dollar devaluation and something I'm curious about.
[03:00:04.677 --> 03:00:17.007]  If the dollar is being devalued, then wouldn't to the debt that middle class Americans and by extension even Canadians owe also be devalued, being paid back in nominal dollars?
[03:00:17.007 --> 03:00:19.609]  It'll rob people that were invested in it everywhere, Bob.
[03:00:21.261 --> 03:00:23.222]  We don't know how they're going to do it.
[03:00:23.222 --> 03:00:26.003]  And you won't know until you get there.
[03:00:26.003 --> 03:00:31.365]  What they should do is reduce the debt whatever percentage the dollar falls.
[03:00:31.365 --> 03:00:38.147]  If they don't do that and they call for the debt at the higher level, present levels, everybody will go broke.
[03:00:38.147 --> 03:00:40.488]  And so I don't know which way it's going to go.
[03:00:42.366 --> 03:00:46.370]  Next question I have is something that came upon from a historical point of view.
[03:00:46.370 --> 03:00:54.059]  Something called the silver ratio where historically silver's been valued 16 to 1, 16 times silver to 1 time gold.
[03:00:54.059 --> 03:00:55.020]  How true is that?
[03:00:55.020 --> 03:00:58.924]  Is that historical reflection of what has actually taken place in the past?
[03:00:58.924 --> 03:00:59.425]  Alright, thank you.
[03:00:59.425 --> 03:01:00.146]  Gotta jump, Bob!
[03:01:01.795 --> 03:01:04.056]  It has happened in the past.
[03:01:04.056 --> 03:01:07.318]  It was used by governments for a long time.
[03:01:07.318 --> 03:01:09.959]  But we're into a different era now.
[03:01:09.959 --> 03:01:17.962]  3,000 years ago, the finest suit was this ounce of gold, and you can buy an incredibly nice suit for $1,400 today.
[03:01:17.962 --> 03:01:21.984]  Let's go ahead and talk to, same with silver, you know, the same ratios.
[03:01:21.984 --> 03:01:23.604]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[03:01:23.604 --> 03:01:24.845]  Let's talk to Chris in Arizona.
[03:01:26.306 --> 03:01:27.307]  Oh, hey Alex.
[03:01:27.307 --> 03:01:29.007]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:29.007 --> 03:01:29.748]  I appreciate it.
[03:01:29.748 --> 03:01:33.750]  It's cool that you really don't screen your calls like I've heard you said numerous times.
[03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:35.491]  But anyways, I... Oh, but that's a lie.
[03:01:35.491 --> 03:01:36.531]  You're a fake caller too.
[03:01:36.531 --> 03:01:37.772]  A Vatican assassin.
[03:01:37.772 --> 03:01:39.753]  Go ahead, Vatican assassin.
[03:01:39.753 --> 03:01:48.338]  I woke up... I actually woke up researching the stock market and eventually researching the Federal Reserve and, like, the truth just spoke for itself.
[03:01:48.338 --> 03:01:54.501]  And then I came across people like David Icke and Michael Petrarian and yourself and Mike Kaiser, Max Kaiser.
[03:01:55.337 --> 03:02:16.983]  Anyway, my question, I noticed an Arizona company by the name of G4S Securities rolling around private buses all the time and I looked it up online and that's actually a private company based out of London and that was kind of frustrating to me and then another thing... Yeah, a lot of the contracting isn't spent with local companies, it's spent with foreigners so the money never comes back.
[03:02:16.983 --> 03:02:17.984]  We're out of time.
[03:02:17.984 --> 03:02:18.864]  Comments on that, Bob?
[03:02:20.211 --> 03:02:22.632]  I don't have any because I don't know anything about it.
[03:02:22.632 --> 03:02:24.313]  Last caller, Wolf at Indiana.
[03:02:24.313 --> 03:02:26.634]  Quick question, go ahead.
[03:02:26.634 --> 03:02:29.875]  Alex, nice to hear from you.
[03:02:29.875 --> 03:02:31.736]  Are you there?
[03:02:31.736 --> 03:02:33.617]  Yeah, I called you because I wanted to say hi.
[03:02:33.617 --> 03:02:35.458]  Wolf, nice to hear from you too.
[03:02:35.458 --> 03:02:36.499]  What's on your mind?
[03:02:36.499 --> 03:02:45.823]  I'm very glad to hear from you because people have been telling me that Alex Jones has bugged out in March and I'm here in Indiana.
[03:02:46.623 --> 03:02:51.607]  And something major is... Sir, I can't respond to every schizophrenic craziness.
[03:02:51.607 --> 03:02:53.509]  I'm going to be on air March 15th.
[03:02:53.509 --> 03:02:55.150]  There is no Planet X coming.
[03:02:55.150 --> 03:02:56.951]  The meteor's not going to get us.
[03:02:56.951 --> 03:02:58.532]  It's all baloney.
[03:02:58.532 --> 03:03:02.315]  And I'll be discredited when I'm here March 15th and nothing happens.
[03:03:02.315 --> 03:03:07.039]  The kooks that lied about all this and said I'm... Look, they're going to say I'm a hologram that day.
[03:03:07.039 --> 03:03:09.741]  And then when no meteor kills us, it's total schizophrenic.
[03:03:09.741 --> 03:03:10.362]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:11.002 --> 03:03:14.424]  I mean, Bob, I tell ya, sometimes when it rains it pours.
[03:03:28.715 --> 03:03:32.817]  Well, I mean, it's like, we're discredited because we were right about gold and silver going up.
[03:03:32.817 --> 03:03:35.339]  Those that were wrong, they have credit.
[03:03:35.339 --> 03:03:37.940]  So that's what America is.
[03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:39.721]  But we're trying to resuscitate America.
[03:03:39.721 --> 03:03:42.442]  Bob, Lord willing, I'll see you next Friday.
[03:03:42.442 --> 03:03:43.763]  It's always great talking to you.
[03:03:43.763 --> 03:03:45.604]  Say hi to the wife and family for me.
[03:03:45.604 --> 03:03:48.005]  And I'll see you next Friday, my friend.
[03:03:48.005 --> 03:03:51.147]  Thank you, and thank you all for listening, and same to you, Alex.
[03:03:51.147 --> 03:03:51.467]  You bet.
[03:03:51.467 --> 03:03:53.609]  Now, I gotta go, folks, because the comment's coming to kill us.
[03:03:53.609 --> 03:03:55.390]  In fact, I gotta go right now.
[03:03:55.390 --> 03:03:57.030]  There'll be a hologram from here on out.
[03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.591]  It won't be me.
