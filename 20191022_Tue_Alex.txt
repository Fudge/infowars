[00:00.000 --> 00:06.240]  Gavin McInnes is back with his all new online network Free Speech dot TV. Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs,
[00:06.240 --> 00:10.000]  Miley Unopolis, and Soph all at Free Speech dot TV.
[00:10.000 --> 00:27.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:31.120 --> 00:37.040]  And we are live on this October 22nd, 2019 edition with me, your host Paul Joseph Watson,
[00:37.040 --> 00:43.920]  filling in for Alex Jones for the first two hours. In the second hour, we're going to talk to Laura
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.280]  Luma, who has made the comeback of all comebacks, basically, banned off of every social media
[00:49.280 --> 00:56.560]  platform, banned off of numerous other company platforms. She's outraised the Democratic incumbent
[00:56.560 --> 01:01.520]  there in South Rock, Florida, and she's outraised the combined total of the GOP candidates.
[01:01.520 --> 01:09.600]  All of them put together from zero platform whatsoever, from all media, social media platforms,
[01:09.600 --> 01:14.400]  because, of course, she's been banned on everything else. So we're going to talk to her in the second
[01:14.400 --> 01:20.000]  hour about her campaign, what she foresees, how she can win that campaign. It's a very
[01:20.560 --> 01:25.280]  democratically held seat. It's a very tight seat there in Florida. I think they voted for
[01:25.280 --> 01:32.640]  Hillary over Trump, 69%. So it's going to be an uphill task, but she has outraised the Democratic
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.960]  incumbent. So we're going to talk to her about her plans to win that race. Meanwhile, I'm looking
[01:38.960 --> 01:46.880]  at the Drudge Report and his top headline, Dem Halloween, Hillary Leaves Door Open. Yes, the
[01:46.880 --> 01:53.040]  witch is back. And this is a story which is also replicated. Basically, it's the same story
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.920]  upon summit.news, which is Hillary laughs with delight after audience members suggest she run
[01:57.920 --> 02:03.920]  for president. Now, we've had several indications over the last few weeks that, yes, indeed,
[02:03.920 --> 02:10.160]  Hillary is aiming for a third failed presidential run. Of course, former White House chief strategist
[02:10.160 --> 02:16.000]  Steve Bannon thinks that that's exactly what she's waiting for. She's primed to get in at the right
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.440]  moment, whether that moment is imminent remains to be seen. But, of course, she also appeared on
[02:21.440 --> 02:27.120]  Stephen Colbert's show a few weeks ago and refused to endorse any of the Democratic candidates. She
[02:27.120 --> 02:33.280]  was asked again during this event in Portland, Oregon, who she was going to endorse. She was up
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.640]  on a panel with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton. And basically, somebody in the audience, she said,
[02:38.640 --> 02:44.320]  we have a list of candidates. We have to nominate the best. As soon as Hillary said that,
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.520]  somebody in the audience shouted out, you, Hillary reacted with a big smile and a laugh
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.880]  before saying, oh, my, well, thank you. And again, it's up on top of the Drudge Report right now.
[02:54.880 --> 03:01.120]  Of course, we had predicted the big political website for predicting future presidential
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.320]  candidates, future Democratic candidates, suggesting that she was the third favorite.
[03:06.320 --> 03:11.280]  And that was about two weeks ago. She slipped down since. But again, more indications that
[03:11.280 --> 03:18.160]  Hillary Clinton might be preparing to run. Of course, the meme makers are licking their chops
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.400]  at the prospect of that. It's going to be very exciting indeed if she does, in fact,
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.800]  take on a third failed presidential candidacy. But it ties in with this headline,
[03:26.800 --> 03:31.760]  which was also linked up on the Drudge Report earlier. Anxious Democratic establishment asks,
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.760]  is there anybody else? The candidates, the paucity of candidates, the paucity of quality
[03:37.760 --> 03:44.320]  candidates is so self-evident that this article asks, when half a dozen Democratic donors gathered
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.840]  at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion
[03:47.840 --> 03:52.800]  of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential
[03:52.800 --> 03:58.000]  Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.360]  race, but who could be lured in. So they're not satisfied with whoever they've got up there at
[04:03.360 --> 04:11.040]  the moment. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton continues to bash Tulsi Gabbard. And in fact, she canceled
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.920]  a planned appearance at a speaking event where Tulsi Gabbard would be attending.
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.440]  So we're going to get into that because Trump himself, of course, yesterday,
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.880]  came out and branded Hillary, Hillary's Russia asset conspiracy theory, which she leveled at
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.840]  Tulsi Gabbard, quote, sick. We're going to get into that. We're going to get into the New York
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.120]  Times saying from before that the deep state didn't exist and that anyone who talked about a deep
[04:35.120 --> 04:40.880]  state was a racist, right-wing conspiracy theorist. Now they say it's here, it's real,
[04:40.880 --> 04:47.120]  and it's here to rescue the Republic from President Trump. So before you were a dangerous
[04:47.120 --> 04:51.680]  conspiracy theorist for even mentioning the term deep state, now the New York Times says
[04:51.680 --> 04:57.120]  it's real and it's good. Just like they said back in the day that global government didn't exist,
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.360]  and it became so obvious that that was the agenda they had to admit it was real,
[05:01.360 --> 05:06.240]  but that it was a benign positive force. We'll be back in the next segment, breaking news at
[05:06.240 --> 05:14.400]  infowars.com. Don't go away. Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakily to tell you
[05:14.400 --> 05:20.240]  all that there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting
[05:20.240 --> 05:26.480]  you. Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer
[05:26.480 --> 05:31.200]  and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people? That's
[05:31.200 --> 05:38.800]  right. Drink the fluoride. Don't visit infowarsstore.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad
[05:38.800 --> 05:45.120]  halogen. Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the
[05:45.120 --> 05:53.200]  fluoride and plunge into subservience to us. We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the
[05:53.200 --> 06:00.400]  fluoride. Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do. Don't support Alex Jones.
[06:00.400 --> 06:06.640]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Nambla have access to your
[06:06.640 --> 06:09.840]  children.
[06:20.320 --> 06:28.480]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.200]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:35.360 --> 06:40.240]  So the effort to topple a democratically elected president, which has been an effort that's been
[06:40.240 --> 06:46.960]  ongoing for three years plus now, continues apace. The impeachment bandwagon rolls on. Of course,
[06:46.960 --> 06:54.800]  the Democrats have just 47 seats in the Senate. They need 67 votes to convict Trump. But according
[06:54.800 --> 07:01.680]  to a strategist, a GOP strategist called Mike Murphy, he says there may be 30 Senate Republicans
[07:01.680 --> 07:07.920]  who would vote to convict Trump if the vote was held in secret, how many of those can be turned
[07:07.920 --> 07:13.920]  around to do so publicly. And at the same time, we have Hillary Clinton once again making every
[07:13.920 --> 07:21.440]  indication that she's going to make her venture into the democratic field at this relatively
[07:21.440 --> 07:25.840]  late stage, given that most or at least numerous debates have already happened.
[07:26.880 --> 07:30.240]  It's up on the Drudge Report as a top headline. It's also at summit.news.
[07:30.240 --> 07:33.760]  Hillary last with Deli after audience members suggest she run for president.
[07:34.480 --> 07:40.880]  She was doing a forum event with her daughter and said, we have to nominate Koff. Of course,
[07:40.880 --> 07:46.800]  she's coughing already. Get ready for that again. The best. And then somebody in the audience shouted
[07:46.800 --> 07:54.800]  out, you as Hillary was about to say the word candidate. And again, she appeared earlier this
[07:54.800 --> 08:01.440]  month on PBS News Hour, taunting Trump, saying, obviously, I can beat him again because, yeah,
[08:01.440 --> 08:06.640]  she beat him the first time, didn't she? She also failed to beat Barack Obama or even run against
[08:06.640 --> 08:12.560]  him in 2008. Of course, she also fan the flames of speculation when she tweeted at Trump a week
[08:12.560 --> 08:19.920]  ago, quote, don't tempt me. So again, all indications suggest that Hillary, probably the most arrogant
[08:19.920 --> 08:26.080]  politician in American history, still completely oblivious to the degree with which she's absolutely
[08:26.080 --> 08:33.520]  hated by huge numbers of Americans still might throw her hat into the ring. Because as I pointed
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.840]  out with this article before, anxious democratic establishment asks, is there anybody else?
[08:37.840 --> 08:44.640]  They had a meeting with a bunch of donors at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan, and they asked,
[08:44.640 --> 08:49.680]  would Hillary Clinton get in? The contributors wondered. How about Michael Bloomberg? How
[08:49.680 --> 08:55.680]  about Michelle Obama? Would she consider entering at this late stage? Of course, her approval
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.080]  ratings are far better than Hillary Clinton's, but she said over and over again that she's not
[09:00.080 --> 09:06.480]  going to get involved. This is a quote. Since the last debate, just anecdotally, I've had five or
[09:06.480 --> 09:12.080]  six people ask me, is there anybody else said lay a doerty? A longtime Democrat was run two of the
[09:12.080 --> 09:17.840]  party's recent conventions. So they're not satisfied with anyone who's running, and Hillary
[09:17.840 --> 09:24.960]  Clinton could be about to step into that vacuum. But she's still getting a lot of bad press, a lot
[09:24.960 --> 09:31.520]  of heat for her treatment of Tulsi Gabbard. Of course, it's probably the only authentic politician
[09:31.520 --> 09:38.160]  within that entire democratic field. We had this article up yesterday on summit.news. Hillary
[09:38.160 --> 09:44.560]  Clinton cancels appearance at event where Tulsi Gabbard is speaking. This is a 2019 fortune,
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.240]  most powerful women's summit. She claimed she had, quote, a scheduling conflict that would prevent
[09:50.240 --> 09:57.360]  her from attending this forum. But of course, this was announced after it was revealed that
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.400]  Tulsi Gabbard would be attending. A source close to Clinton told Slate that Hillary dropped out
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.760]  because Kirsten Nielsen, the former secretary of Homeland Security, is also scheduled to speak
[10:07.760 --> 10:13.760]  at the event. However, some speculate the real reason Hillary got cold feet is because Tulsi
[10:13.760 --> 10:19.360]  Gabbard will be attending. Of course, she claimed that Russia was grooming Tulsi Gabbard to be a
[10:19.360 --> 10:25.360]  spoiler to help President Trump with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Everybody I don't like
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.560]  is a Russian asset. We've had that narrative for three and a half years, no matter how many times
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.720]  it gets debunked and discredited. That is their go-to excuse for everything under the sun.
[10:38.480 --> 10:42.160]  This is a quote. I think they've got their eye on somebody who's currently in the democratic
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.000]  primary and are grooming her to be the third party candidate. That's what Clinton said about
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.360]  Tulsi Gabbard. She's the favor of the Russians. Gabbard hit back. And we played that video,
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.480]  that viral video of her hitting back at Hillary Clinton, saying that Clinton represented the
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.000]  queen of warmongers, the embodiment of corruption, the personification of the rot that has sickened
[11:04.000 --> 11:09.440]  the democratic party for so long. And if you look at her social media metrics over the past
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.360]  five days or so since that confrontation with Clinton, Tulsi Gabbard is going through the roof.
[11:15.920 --> 11:21.200]  Tends to be the fact that if you go up against Clinton, who is universally hated by a lot of
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.440]  people, it makes you look quite good. So Tulsi Gabbard is definitely playing off of that.
[11:28.400 --> 11:36.080]  And in fact, Donald Trump himself spoke out in defense of Tulsi Gabbard during his cabinet
[11:36.080 --> 11:41.600]  meeting yesterday. And we have that clip right now. Trump brands Hillary and Russia conspiracy
[11:41.600 --> 11:46.880]  theorists as sick. Let's go ahead and play President Trump. Hillary Clinton, if you've heard
[11:46.880 --> 11:53.120]  of her, she's the one that's accusing everybody of being a Russian agent. Anybody that is opposed
[11:53.120 --> 12:00.080]  to her is a Russian agent. So that's a scam that was pretty much put down. Tulsi, I don't know
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.360]  Tulsi, but she's not a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. I know she likes environment.
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.360]  I don't think she likes Russians. If she does like them, I know she's not a asset. She called her
[12:11.360 --> 12:18.880]  an asset of Russia. These people are sick. There's something wrong with them. But I think that
[12:19.680 --> 12:24.800]  Tulsi Gabbard probably got helped quite a bit by this stare. I think we were helped because it
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.280]  shows for two and a half years, we end up winning. I had to go through two and a half years. If she
[12:29.280 --> 12:33.920]  would have done this earlier, people would have realized what a scam it is. Everybody's a Russian
[12:33.920 --> 12:40.800]  or a Russian agent or a Russian asset. So they have it. Of course, Trump mentioned Jill Stein there.
[12:40.800 --> 12:45.200]  And that is the fear. If Tulsi Gabbard runs as a third party candidate, she could take away
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.440]  four, five, six percent of the vote from the Democratic candidate. And she may indeed run
[12:51.440 --> 12:55.440]  as a third party candidate, given that she's the only authentic candidate in the field of
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.400]  Democrats thus far. Maybe you could make the argument for Andrew Yang, but that is a potential
[13:00.400 --> 13:05.520]  spoiler. Does it mean that Russia is behind it? No, that's completely ridiculous the same way they
[13:05.520 --> 13:11.280]  said it about Jill Stein. No evidence to back it up whatsoever. Talking about no evidence, the New
[13:11.280 --> 13:16.160]  York Times, for basically the past three and a half years, has said there's no evidence that
[13:16.160 --> 13:23.840]  a deep state even exists. Well, now they say it does exist, but it's a good thing. Headline
[13:23.840 --> 13:28.640]  on enforce.com. New York Times shifts from the deep state doesn't exist to its real,
[13:28.640 --> 13:34.880]  and it's here to rescue the Republic from Trump. Yes, you can trust them. You can trust them now,
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.120]  even though we said they didn't exist for three and a half years. The New York Times has gone from
[13:39.120 --> 13:44.480]  insisting the deep state doesn't exist to admitting it's real, but insisting it's totally awesome and
[13:44.480 --> 13:50.880]  here to rescue the Republic from Donald Blomf. The deep state is alive and well composed of
[13:50.880 --> 13:57.600]  patriotic public servants. This is the New York Times opinion, and that's how they pass it off.
[13:57.600 --> 14:02.160]  Often they put opinion pieces as actual news, so the line between those two has been completely
[14:02.160 --> 14:09.200]  blurred anyway. But this is a tweet put out by an official New York Times account. Their aim
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.840]  is not to bring down President Trump. Oh, no, that's not what they've been doing relentlessly
[14:13.840 --> 14:20.960]  for the past three and a half years, every possible turn. But it's out of personal political animus,
[14:20.960 --> 14:27.280]  but to rescue the Republic from his excesses. Michelle Collette writes in The New York Times,
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.760]  they are not the resistance, they are not a cabal, they are public servants. Let us now
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.960]  praise these not silent heroes. And that goes on and on. You can go and read The New York Times
[14:36.960 --> 14:43.120]  article. Chris Menahan comments, unselected, unelected intelligence agents like the phony CIA
[14:43.120 --> 14:48.240]  whistled by what are here to rescue us through an administrative coup to ensure President Trump
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.360]  cannot follow through on the campaign promises he was democratically elected on, such as pulling
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.600]  out the Middle East or making peace with Russia. So now the deep state exists. It's good. It's
[14:59.600 --> 15:07.280]  going to tear down Trump externalization of the method. If you please. Meanwhile, racist watch
[15:07.280 --> 15:13.840]  website outs Trump donors goes offline. This is that zero hedge. Apparently, it's not enough for
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.240]  the left just to spit on supporters of President Donald Trump. Of course, he played that video
[15:18.240 --> 15:24.720]  last week. For an apparent activist group called Public Service Media Group, outing Trump donors
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.440]  across America is what really makes the difference has triggered leftist panic that all they have
[15:29.440 --> 15:36.880]  is hashtag not Trump as they head into the 2020 election campaign. So with all this parties and
[15:36.880 --> 15:41.600]  bickering with all this tension, with all this call from people like Maxine Waters and others
[15:41.600 --> 15:47.360]  that within the Democratic establishment to go out and confront Trump supporters, members of
[15:47.360 --> 15:52.720]  Trump's cabinet. And of course, not only shout them down, get in their face in some cases violently
[15:52.720 --> 15:58.240]  attack them as we've seen on multiple occasions, especially with anyone daring to wear a MAGA hat.
[15:58.240 --> 16:04.560]  Now they're outing where these Trump donors live in New York. What do you think is going to happen
[16:04.560 --> 16:11.520]  next? We'll be back. Don't go away. Attention GCN self reliance listeners. If you've ever
[16:11.520 --> 16:16.560]  wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass

[16:25.760 --> 16:30.480]  you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.560]  historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.280]  flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it
[16:39.280 --> 16:43.840]  back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.920]  if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out

[18:09.040 --> 18:15.360]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other bestselling bone broth formulas that sell for 35,
[18:15.360 --> 18:22.400]  40, 50, 60 bucks retail that are discounted for like $39.95. But they don't have as much pure
[18:22.400 --> 18:27.280]  concentrated bone broth as we do. They don't have as much chocolate mushroom. They don't have as much
[18:27.280 --> 18:34.000]  bee pollen. They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients. And yes, we've gone out and just
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.560]  made a stronger version of other bestsellers and it's selling out. Unlock the ancient power of bone

[19:07.280 --> 19:16.000]  infowarslife.com. Infowars presents Alex Jones. In August of 2019, Jama or the Journal of the
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.120]  American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit
[19:21.120 --> 19:26.000]  of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility and a lot of babies dying
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.880]  in the womb and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this.
[19:30.880 --> 19:35.600]  You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.800]  unless it's part of adding fluoride and then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly
[19:40.800 --> 19:46.720]  chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[19:46.720 --> 19:51.280]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters an iodine
[19:51.280 --> 19:58.720]  at infowarstore.com. Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over.
[19:58.720 --> 20:04.080]  Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high quality iodine counter it. No, roll over and die dirty
[20:04.080 --> 20:08.480]  Americans infowarstore.com forward slash show.
[20:12.080 --> 20:14.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:14.800 --> 20:33.920]  News, analysis, reports. It's the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[20:38.480 --> 20:40.880]  I think it's vital to understand the stakes.
[20:40.880 --> 20:46.640]  And why the deep state that's hijacked this nation is so panicked right now because they see their
[20:46.640 --> 20:53.760]  power and their control slipping away. Because if you control the United States, you control the
[20:53.760 --> 21:01.040]  world. If Trump is impeached and convicted in the Senate, his first term appointments to
[21:01.040 --> 21:07.040]  Supreme Court United States will be assailed. Getting rid of Trump means they will impeach
[21:07.040 --> 21:12.000]  cabinet on next, which they've already been promoting and getting ready. And they will
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.480]  try to nullify all federal judges, hundreds of them that he's put in. This is way bigger than
[21:18.480 --> 21:25.440]  one man as my friend, my gathams points out. It's time, ladies and gentlemen, to wake up.
[21:26.320 --> 21:31.520]  It's time to realize this is literally the future of humanity. We're talking about because the
[21:31.520 --> 21:40.560]  globalist are technocrats who want a post human world. They've thrown down the gauntlet. GOPB
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.560]  warrant impeachment will set off democratic push to reverse Trump's Supreme Court appointments,
[21:46.560 --> 21:52.560]  tax cuts, and regulatory reforms. We get Mike Adams at naturalnews.com for an excellent article.
[21:52.560 --> 21:58.720]  I suggest you share it from there or news wars.com or info wars.com. But whatever you do,

[22:51.120 --> 22:55.920]  Schreuer is coming up. I've got more special reports as well and I'll be back in the office
[22:55.920 --> 23:05.120]  later this afternoon. Please take action. That was Alex Jones talking about the impeachment
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.600]  bandwagon. Of course, there's also a great article which everyone should read up on infowars.com
[23:09.600 --> 23:14.640]  right now by Michael Snyder. If Donald Trump is impeached, that will be a sign that all hell is
[23:14.640 --> 23:20.800]  about to break loose in America. We've had warnings of civil war, warnings of riots, warnings of
[23:20.800 --> 23:26.160]  civil unrest. Of course, we had that after Trump was elected. We had Hillary Clinton supporters
[23:26.160 --> 23:31.120]  rioting in the streets. They're probably going to do so again if Trump wins reelection, which
[23:31.120 --> 23:37.440]  the polls suggest he will if we have an average or a low turnout. But also what will the reaction
[23:37.440 --> 23:42.560]  be of Trump supporters if indeed Trump is impeached? We're going to go back to Alex Jones now
[23:42.560 --> 23:47.920]  talking about the leftist socialist globalist conspiracy. Here is Alex Jones once again.
[23:47.920 --> 23:56.400]  What do socialism, communism, and globalism all have in common? They're all command and control
[23:57.040 --> 24:04.080]  centralized systems that have a Politburo or a group of bureaucrats, technocrats that run them.
[24:04.960 --> 24:12.800]  And if you study the top Fortune 100 companies and the big banks to a company, they finance
[24:12.800 --> 24:19.920]  the move towards centralization and towards world government. So when President Trump gets up there
[24:19.920 --> 24:28.640]  and says socialism, communism, and globalism are our enemies, he is singling out the true enemy
[24:28.640 --> 24:35.200]  of humanity. And that's why the system is so incredibly scared. The 20th century industrialized
[24:35.200 --> 24:40.080]  and computerized everything. And humanity really got sucker punched by these guys with all the
[24:40.080 --> 24:46.640]  Hollywood propaganda. But 19 years into the 21st century, humanity is coming back from the dead
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.320]  and really realizing what's happening and understanding how these big multinational
[24:50.320 --> 24:55.600]  corporations aren't liberal, they're fascistic, they're authoritarian, but they package themselves
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.680]  as liberal and loving. The truth is they're trying to create a planet that's post-human,
[25:02.240 --> 25:08.080]  where normal natural human activity has been basically outlawed and everything is artificiality,
[25:08.080 --> 25:10.800]  where you've got to get government and corporate approval, even have a child,
[25:11.440 --> 25:16.320]  because we've been so poisoned, it's impossible to have a child. That's their final revolution,
[25:16.960 --> 25:21.040]  ending what we are as a species forever. That's what the Carnegie Endowment was tasked to do
[25:21.040 --> 25:26.080]  at the end of World War II, and that's their plan. And that's why they're so upset at President
[25:26.080 --> 25:31.920]  Trump, that's why they're so upset at InfoWars. InfoWars is credited by the leftist-run CIA and
[25:31.920 --> 25:35.920]  by the Ford Foundation and by media matters and by all these different globalist organs
[25:35.920 --> 25:42.480]  as launching Trump and as writing the talking points for the global resistance. But we really
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.680]  didn't do that. We simply studied the white papers of the Chai comms and the EU and the
[25:47.680 --> 25:53.280]  Council on Foreign Relations and the transhumanist movements and understood what their real sneak
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.960]  attack revolution against humanity was and decided to say, hey, I bet folks will want to
[25:58.960 --> 26:05.200]  hear about this, especially as it begins to actually manifest and emerge, and I bet people
[26:05.200 --> 26:11.040]  will resist it. And you know what? My basic understanding of reality and history turned
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.960]  out to be damn right. And so what the enemy to know, I didn't bring this resistance, I simply
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.160]  helped point it out and I bet on humanity, something you haven't been doing. So if you
[26:22.160 --> 26:25.840]  want to stand with humanity and stand with InfoWars and stand with President Trump,
[26:25.840 --> 26:28.960]  spread the word about this live broadcast, spread the word about the articles and buy
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.720]  some products at InfoWarsStore.com because without you supporting us, the enemy will win.
[26:32.720 --> 26:38.400]  You take action, we are going to kick some major globalist ass into the future and have a pro-human
[26:38.400 --> 26:44.880]  future. We're fighting a campaign against leftists, socialists and globalists who want to return to
[26:44.880 --> 26:52.160]  reckless wars, open borders, rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals. We're
[26:52.160 --> 26:59.920]  changing that one around very quickly. They believe America is the world's piggy bank
[26:59.920 --> 27:06.240]  and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense of every other
[27:06.240 --> 27:13.440]  nation in the world but our own. It's not happening anymore. Our political opposition
[27:14.320 --> 27:19.600]  made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens and you know that's what's been happening
[27:19.600 --> 27:29.760]  and that's why 2016 was so important and that's why 2020, I can never say it's more
[27:29.760 --> 27:35.120]  important but you know it's like the roots of a tree, you plant the baby tree, it's got to catch.
[27:35.920 --> 27:41.840]  Get that extra time, we'll have more tax cuts, we'll have even, I'll tell you what,
[27:41.840 --> 27:47.600]  we have rebuilt our military. What we've done has never been done before.
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.160]  They had President Trump talking about how important 2016 was and how important 2020 will be.
[27:54.160 --> 28:01.120]  You know one of the main reasons why he won or why his base was so energized especially online
[28:01.120 --> 28:08.160]  back in 2016 was the power of memes. In fact there were studies done into the effectiveness
[28:08.160 --> 28:12.800]  of memes, one in particular by University College London, which found that the most
[28:12.800 --> 28:19.040]  effective memes spread in two places back in 2016 to help propel Trump to victory.
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.400]  One of them was the subreddit, the Donald, which of course has since been quarantined by Reddit
[28:24.400 --> 28:30.160]  and the other one was of course Fortune. Now in the months and the years since that time
[28:30.880 --> 28:37.360]  we've seen Instagram, Facebook and Twitter try in a myriad of different ways to crack down
[28:37.360 --> 28:43.600]  and censor political memes and when we get back I'm going to explain the latest offensive on that
[28:43.600 --> 28:51.520]  front. As Fortune itself prepares to relaunch there it's okay to be white stunt. We're going to
[28:51.520 --> 28:58.720]  talk about what Twitter is doing to once again censor and ban memes. Wait until you hear this
[28:58.720 --> 29:04.480]  new language that they've come out with which is blatantly targeted towards banning memes. This
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.960]  is the Alex Jones show live breaking news at infowalls.com. We'll be back. Finally there's a
[29:08.960 --> 29:13.520]  way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation
[29:13.520 --> 29:19.440]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Seen on

[29:28.880 --> 29:32.880]  shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture
[29:32.880 --> 29:37.760]  dozens of critical digital assets. Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have
[29:37.760 --> 29:43.280]  a proven turnkey equipment sale lease back program with a 27% annualized lease payment

[30:02.800 --> 30:05.760]  owner's consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell
[30:05.760 --> 30:10.880]  the security which requires an offering document. Please listen to this information because it
[30:10.880 --> 30:15.840]  can save your life and it can save the life of others. There couldn't be more critical
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.600]  information for your physical body. God's more important when it comes to your soul,
[30:19.600 --> 30:25.680]  but this is most important when it comes to your body. If people didn't know that you put motor oil
[30:25.680 --> 30:31.600]  in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned and think you put salt
[30:31.600 --> 30:36.400]  water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly. Well, if they put fluoride
[30:36.400 --> 30:40.960]  in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility. If you put the
[30:40.960 --> 30:46.080]  good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good high-quality motor oil
[30:46.080 --> 30:50.720]  in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's that simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy
[30:50.720 --> 30:55.280]  at m4store.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[30:55.280 --> 31:01.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything.
[31:01.040 --> 31:05.280]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of
[31:05.280 --> 31:12.400]  high-quality iodine and biotrystallinium at m4store.com today. Here are the facts.
[31:13.440 --> 31:19.920]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies,
[31:19.920 --> 31:27.040]  including the American Medical Journal. Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases
[31:27.040 --> 31:33.840]  cancer, and destroys fertility. That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy. And then once
[31:33.840 --> 31:38.480]  you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family. The reason I'm so hot on this is the
[31:38.480 --> 31:43.360]  globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine. In China,
[31:43.360 --> 31:47.520]  they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people
[31:47.520 --> 31:54.320]  under their control. The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to m4store.com, experience iodine
[31:54.320 --> 31:59.200]  and biotrystallinium that goes with it together. And then once you see the great results, warn others.
[31:59.200 --> 32:03.280]  This is the Achilles' Hill of the Globalist. It's a win-win situation. The only way you lose
[32:03.280 --> 32:13.520]  is not taking action. Take action now. Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakely. And
[32:14.240 --> 32:18.080]  I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show, and it's the Rockefeller
[32:18.080 --> 32:23.440]  Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents.
[32:23.440 --> 32:30.480]  Where they said that to be free from war, we must end the family and masculinity, and that we must
[32:30.480 --> 32:36.080]  put chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile.
[32:36.960 --> 32:43.680]  A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice, telling you to
[32:43.680 --> 32:50.160]  look into how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's
[32:50.160 --> 32:56.480]  a conspiracy theory, okay? There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride.
[32:56.480 --> 33:02.720]  Just drink extra fluoride, and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep
[33:03.280 --> 33:05.360]  when I talk to you real soft like this.
[33:05.360 --> 33:15.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:15.280 --> 33:39.920]  You're live, and there's a headline on summit.news, a story that I wrote yesterday which ties into this
[33:39.920 --> 33:47.120]  whole effort, this affront to ban means, which is restarted in anticipation of the 2020 election.
[33:47.680 --> 33:53.120]  Headline four chanterelles planning to relaunch, it's okay to be white stunt. Of course, they
[33:53.120 --> 34:00.160]  first did this back in 2017 as a way to troll the media and progressives into revealing the fact
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.600]  that they are in fact the true racist, which you saw again with the election of Canada's first
[34:05.600 --> 34:13.520]  black president just in Trudeau last night, who of course is the number one black faced enthusiast
[34:13.520 --> 34:18.960]  across the entire planet. Progressives reelected him. He's got a minority government, but he has
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.080]  been reelected proving once again that they don't care if somebody is a racist. So long as that
[34:24.080 --> 34:30.240]  racist is on their team. Well, that's similar to what 4chan did back in 2017 when they tried to
[34:30.240 --> 34:37.600]  highlight the bigotry of the left by posting these flyers across major cities and campuses
[34:37.600 --> 34:43.920]  that merely say it's okay to be white. Of course, if anyone is triggered by that, if they have a bad
[34:43.920 --> 34:49.120]  reaction to it, it only shines a light on them. It only puts up a mirror to their face and reveals
[34:49.120 --> 34:55.360]  their own anti-white bigotry because in essence, they're saying, no, it's not okay to be white.
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.880]  Well, now 4chan trolls are planning to repeat the stunt in order to force the media into generating
[35:00.880 --> 35:07.600]  a fresh moral panic about racism. So a bunch of posts which are featured in this article have
[35:07.600 --> 35:13.520]  appeared on 4chan over the past week or so about these posters and it says that they're going to
[35:13.520 --> 35:21.120]  try the same stunt again on October 31st Halloween and try to cause a quote media freak out.
[35:21.120 --> 35:26.640]  They say that it should be even crazier this time. They're encouraging people to print the posters,
[35:26.640 --> 35:32.720]  to wear costumes, to plaster them everywhere. And in fact, another post that appeared on 4chan
[35:33.680 --> 35:39.360]  was about an unnamed school which has already alerted students and faculty as to the prospect
[35:39.360 --> 35:47.520]  of these deadly posters appearing on campus. Yes, the deadly dastardly threat posed by pieces of
[35:47.520 --> 35:52.720]  paper with words on them because, of course, in clown world, everything is a hysterical
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.320]  dog whistle to racism now. Many have commented the stunt is particularly cunning because it
[35:58.320 --> 36:04.480]  forces the left to adopt the ideologically bigoted view that it isn't okay to be white,
[36:04.480 --> 36:11.440]  thus revealing them to be the actual racist. That is the power of this meme. And we had a story out
[36:11.440 --> 36:18.960]  of Emma's Pennsylvania last year where they had an absolute free cow after these posters appeared
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.840]  in a few places across the town of Emma's Pennsylvania. They were called a distasteful
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.280]  act of vandalism. In fact, one resident, or I think you may have even been on the board of the
[36:29.280 --> 36:36.320]  council there, Joshua Westbrook, told a local news agency, quote, I mean we're surrounded by white
[36:36.320 --> 36:43.600]  privilege nowadays. It's just a fact. So it is completely racist to say it's okay to be white.
[36:43.600 --> 36:50.400]  So they're actually preparing to pull the same stunt once again on October 31st because that was
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.440]  a very powerful meme. You can judge that it was a powerful meme by the way the left, by the way the
[36:55.440 --> 37:01.680]  media reacted to it, of course, completely falling for the bait as they did with the okay hand sign
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.280]  being another dog whistle for white supremacy. Well, now we have this headline. And I'm going to
[37:07.280 --> 37:13.280]  preface it actually before by flashing back to a headline we had on Infowars from May, Instagram
[37:13.280 --> 37:18.640]  to fact check and remove memes. And that is when Instagram announced that it would begin fact checking
[37:18.640 --> 37:26.240]  and removing memes. They would be using 52 global fact checking partners, even though memes aren't
[37:26.240 --> 37:32.640]  even supposed to be factual. They're satirical illustrations or cartoons mainly to censor
[37:32.640 --> 37:40.000]  false photos and memes on its platform. That was happening back in May. And as I wrote in the article
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.800]  at the time, quite why memes have to be fact checked at all given they're almost always satirical
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.600]  and are not intended to be statements of fact, maybe a mystery to some. It's actually not a
[37:49.600 --> 37:56.960]  mystery at all. Because even a vice write up of a study by the University College London found
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.880]  that the most effective memes in 2016 that helped propel Donald Trump to election originated in two
[38:02.880 --> 38:08.720]  places, the subreddit that Donald, which has now been castrated and quarantined by Reddit,
[38:09.760 --> 38:16.320]  and of course, the poll forum on 4chan. And then you had Buzzfeed lobbying Twitter to ban a meme
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.760]  which made fun of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You had Facebook announcing the deployment of a large
[38:21.760 --> 38:28.960]  scale AI program called Rosetta, which would quote automatically proactively identify
[38:28.960 --> 38:36.000]  inappropriate or harmful content in images on social networks. The left court meme, so it's so
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.240]  much easier to ban memes and academic studies have proven that those memes were really successful
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.800]  in energizing Trump's base, helping him build that enthusiasm during 2016, which is why the
[38:48.800 --> 38:55.280]  left the progressive networks are in a blind panic about the power of memes. Remember on Twitter,
[38:56.320 --> 39:01.920]  they were banning people. In fact, that's why James Woods was suspended. I can't recall if he ever
[39:01.920 --> 39:07.520]  actually came back to Twitter after this for posting a satirical meme, which encouraged
[39:07.520 --> 39:14.560]  male Democratic voters to stay at home during the 2018 midterms to allow women to express their
[39:14.560 --> 39:20.000]  voice. Of course, that's a joke. Making them stay at home would make Democrats lose the election.
[39:20.000 --> 39:25.680]  That's a point. It's a joke. But Twitter and Facebook then embarked on a program of not only
[39:25.680 --> 39:32.000]  taking those memes down, but suspending and banning users who posted them. I remember I was suspended
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.760]  back when I had a Facebook account before they banned me entirely for being a dangerous person,
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.840]  even suspended for a month for posting that very meme. There's a war on memes because the
[39:41.840 --> 39:46.800]  left can't meme and because memes are entirely effective and dangerous to their agenda because
[39:46.800 --> 39:51.840]  they have no sense of humor because they're permanently walking on eggshells, petrified
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.920]  of offending anybody with humor, which is why they're so terrible at memes. We have this headline
[39:57.920 --> 40:07.520]  of NationalFile.com, Twitter gears up for meme ban ahead of 2020. They announced yesterday Twitter
[40:07.520 --> 40:14.640]  safety, keeping everyone safe, but for everyone's safety, because they really care about you,
[40:14.640 --> 40:20.720]  they will soon be limiting quote, synthetic and manipulated media, otherwise known as memes
[40:20.720 --> 40:27.040]  on the social platform. Bear in mind, that's not just memes. When they say manipulated media,
[40:27.040 --> 40:34.640]  that is anything that they claim was manipulated by the political right to negatively impact
[40:34.640 --> 40:41.360]  Democrats, progressives or left. You will remember the Jim Acosta hand slap, the infamous hand
[40:41.360 --> 40:46.960]  slap against the White House intern back in, I think it was November last year. They had an
[40:46.960 --> 40:54.480]  entire media narrative that I had personally faked a video of Jim Acosta slapping down an
[40:54.480 --> 41:01.120]  intern's hand, or at least sped it up or manipulated the footage to try and paint a different narrative.
[41:01.120 --> 41:06.400]  That wasn't true. Never manipulated the footage stood by that from day one to the end. Didn't
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.960]  matter. They claimed it was manipulated. So that's why they're doing this. Synthetic and
[41:12.960 --> 41:18.880]  manipulated media is any media that they claim has been altered. So then they can immediately
[41:18.880 --> 41:25.920]  remove it before it goes viral. Now, yes, obviously that includes deep fake technology,
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.320]  which many people have said is a threat to democracy. Yes, that will get removed.
[41:30.320 --> 41:36.640]  But again, it's this broad brush. It's this pushing the boundaries. What is deemed synthetic?
[41:36.640 --> 41:41.600]  What is deemed fake news? Before hand, they never said they would remove quote, fake news,
[41:41.600 --> 41:47.200]  because fake news is entirely subjective. You've seen how many times Snopes gets it wrong because
[41:47.200 --> 41:52.480]  they have a bias, partisan left wing agenda. Fake news to some people is reality to other
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.800]  people doesn't mean there isn't fake news. There is. But again, it's degrees of variation and
[41:56.800 --> 42:02.400]  it's degrees of subjectivity. So of course, this is going to be abused to ban memes.
[42:02.400 --> 42:08.560]  Article continues after Donald Trump's and president of 2016 victory against Hillary
[42:08.560 --> 42:12.720]  Clinton against mammoth odds, most right leaning Twitter users have witnessed a severe backlash
[42:12.720 --> 42:17.760]  in the form of censorship and shadow banning a major social media platforms. But now Twitter has
[42:17.760 --> 42:23.520]  announced and this is their quote from Twitter safety yesterday. What is synthetic and manipulated
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.760]  media? It's media that's been significantly altered or created in a way that changes the
[42:27.760 --> 42:33.120]  original meaning purpose, makes it seem like certain events took place that didn't actually happen.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.400]  That describes memes. That describes the nickel back video where they held up the photograph
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.520]  and it was Joe Biden and his son doing corrupt business dealings with Ukrainians.
[42:45.520 --> 42:51.680]  Twitter took that down as a result of a claimed copyright violation, but that would fit entirely
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.640]  into this new definition of manipulated media. When of course it wasn't manipulated,
[42:56.640 --> 43:02.640]  it was a satirical meme meant to make a point. Now with this new announcement that gives them
[43:02.640 --> 43:11.360]  carte blanche to ban that precise kind of thing, we'll be back in 4Wars.com, let's go away.
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.200]  Don't visit info wars store.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad halogen iodine.
[43:39.200 --> 43:42.080]  Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children.
[43:42.720 --> 43:50.880]  Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience to us. We don't want to compete with you.
[43:50.880 --> 43:58.000]  Just drink the fluoride. Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do. Don't support
[43:58.000 --> 44:04.960]  Alex Jones. Remember I'm speaking with a soft voice so I'm a liberal. I wouldn't let Namble have
[44:04.960 --> 44:13.040]  access to your children. Again, I'm not talking down to the info wars audience, but I've been
[44:13.040 --> 44:18.000]  banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and I'm talking about fluoride and I'm
[44:18.000 --> 44:24.320]  talking about iodine. Now if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass tron boat
[44:24.320 --> 44:30.480]  and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in. If you're a human being,
[44:30.480 --> 44:35.760]  you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[44:35.760 --> 44:40.560]  the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation they put it in the water. They're
[44:40.560 --> 44:44.640]  going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water. They'd
[44:44.640 --> 44:49.920]  execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases
[44:49.920 --> 44:55.360]  fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else. So again, learn about the iodine
[44:55.360 --> 45:00.480]  conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked and then get good
[45:00.480 --> 45:04.800]  iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't. Again,
[45:04.800 --> 45:06.880]  get iodine at infowarstore.com.
[45:09.280 --> 45:17.040]  Infowars presents Alex Jones. In August of 2019, JAMA or the Journal of the American Medical
[45:17.040 --> 45:21.920]  Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride
[45:21.920 --> 45:26.800]  in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility and a lot of babies dying in the womb,
[45:26.800 --> 45:31.440]  and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this. You know,
[45:31.440 --> 45:36.480]  it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California, unless it's
[45:36.480 --> 45:41.760]  part of adding fluoride. And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals
[45:41.760 --> 45:47.520]  to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children. So whatever
[45:47.520 --> 45:53.120]  you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters iodine at infowarstore.com.
[45:53.120 --> 46:00.800]  Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over. Do not visit infowarstore.com
[46:00.800 --> 46:13.600]  and get high poly iodine to counter it. No, roll over and die dirty Americans. infowars.com forward slash show. Hello here, my name is
[46:13.600 --> 46:20.720]  Buckleman. I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all
[46:20.720 --> 46:27.120]  families and children and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries.
[46:27.120 --> 46:32.160]  We took control of you over a hundred years ago. We've been spiking your water with fluoride.
[46:32.160 --> 46:38.800]  Lower your fertility and it hurts you. This works so well, but now because of liability
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.120]  and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of
[46:43.120 --> 46:47.840]  American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done and it makes me so
[46:47.840 --> 46:53.120]  angry. So whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children.
[46:53.120 --> 47:01.680]  And don't visit infowarsstore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3
[47:01.680 --> 47:26.880]  together with bio trucelidium from the mustard seed submit to us infowarsstore.com. The answer to 1984
[47:26.880 --> 47:42.800]  is 1776 live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:42.800 --> 47:59.520]  In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the super villains always hold the world hostage
[48:00.160 --> 48:06.080]  and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands to let them rule the planet
[48:06.800 --> 48:10.160]  because again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule the world.
[48:10.160 --> 48:15.840]  Well, the club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires back in the 60s got
[48:15.840 --> 48:21.600]  together and they publicly wrote articles about this and said we want a way to unify the world
[48:21.600 --> 48:26.720]  into a world government and to do that, we're going to make people the bad guys and carbon the
[48:26.720 --> 48:32.640]  bad guy and then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon taxes and following all of our
[48:32.640 --> 48:38.640]  orders because we're the saviors of the earth. That's so sick. When somebody tells you, do what I
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.360]  say or the world's going to end, they're a cult leader, they're a criminal, they're a threat to
[48:43.360 --> 48:48.480]  everybody and they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon taxes they want us to pay
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.600]  them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator seeds, the toxic waste
[48:53.600 --> 48:59.920]  dumping, all of it. These people know what they're doing, ladies and gentlemen, they want a post-human
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.440]  world and one of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder of CNN and he set up a Georgia
[49:05.440 --> 49:10.080]  guide stones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million people and of course these
[49:10.080 --> 49:16.000]  authoritarians, the savers of the earth, they're going to oversee it all. Here at M4 we're fighting
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.880]  back against this cult. We're fighting back against these people that are telling you that
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.800]  you're the bad guys, you've been cast as that, I've been cast as that and they are the saviors
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.280]  of the earth who are going to fly around on their private jets and live in palaces and have five
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.600]  kids but you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning and you can't have children.
[49:35.600 --> 49:41.920]  This is a way to make slavery cool again, serfdom cool again and M4 war stands firmly against it so
[49:41.920 --> 49:46.560]  whatever you do remember your destiny is in your hands and when you spread the word about M4Wars.com
[49:46.560 --> 49:52.320]  for its last show in band.video you shake these criminals to their very foundations. We've reached
[49:52.320 --> 49:59.600]  a tipping point, press the attack, we will have a pro-human future. I don't think that we are
[49:59.600 --> 50:07.600]  discussing climate change the way we need to be discussing it. We are in the midst of climate
[50:07.600 --> 50:13.200]  change right now and it is only going to get worse. The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't
[50:13.200 --> 50:19.600]  address climate change. The scientists also tell us have 12 years in which to answer that question,
[50:19.600 --> 50:26.720]  12 years within which to act. Like this is the war, this is our world war two. We have 12 years to
[50:26.720 --> 50:33.280]  turn this around. We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. 10 years
[50:33.280 --> 50:39.360]  that we have left to us. Within the 10 years that we have left to us we don't have more than 10 years
[50:39.360 --> 50:45.040]  to get this right. A little more than 10 years from now. There is no justice and there is no
[50:45.040 --> 50:50.320]  combatting climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities. I speak
[50:50.320 --> 50:57.280]  to you as a human being. A woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bitter sweet because of what
[50:57.280 --> 51:03.840]  I know about our children's future. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[51:03.840 --> 51:09.360]  This is about our lives. This is about American lives. That our community will be uninhabitable,
[51:09.360 --> 51:15.120]  not sustain human life along this current trajectory. I am here to say our house is on fire.
[51:15.120 --> 51:20.640]  It's a crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction. We are in the beginning of a mass
[51:20.640 --> 51:27.840]  extinction. People are dying. People are suffering. People are dying. How dare you?
[51:38.080 --> 51:43.920]  Brock and Michelle Obama, they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard. I shouldn't say house. This is
[51:43.920 --> 51:47.120]  a massive incredible beachfront estate.
[51:53.200 --> 51:59.120]  Well, you saw the Obama's beachfront estate there and this ties into an article up on summit.News.
[51:59.120 --> 52:05.360]  It's top story right now. So shocking. Study finds the wealthy and celebrities aren't changing
[52:05.360 --> 52:12.960]  their flying habits to reduce CO2 emissions. Imagine my shock. A new study by Swedish academics
[52:12.960 --> 52:19.840]  has found that most wealthy people and celebrities, such as Bill Gates, are not changing their flying
[52:19.840 --> 52:25.680]  habits to help reduce climate change with some responsible for a thousand times more CO2 emissions
[52:25.680 --> 52:32.960]  than the average person. This is a study carried out by researchers from Lund University in Sweden
[52:33.600 --> 52:37.440]  which reviewed the social media accounts of well-known celebrities and wealthy philanthropists,
[52:37.440 --> 52:42.320]  many of whom relentlessly virtue signal about climate change. You've got to change your life.
[52:42.320 --> 52:48.720]  Turns out they're not really changing theirs. Based on the information posted relating to travel,
[52:48.720 --> 52:53.760]  the researchers calculated the starting point and destination for flights and then worked out
[52:53.760 --> 53:00.800]  likely CO2 emissions and take a rough guess at what they discovered. Of course, we've got the
[53:00.800 --> 53:07.360]  denizens of the climate change movement, people like Leonardo DiCaprio, literally flying tens of
[53:07.360 --> 53:12.480]  their friends from LA to Paris. He's taken a private jet to pick up the environmental award.
[53:12.480 --> 53:16.640]  He flies them all around the world on his private jet to watch his environmentalist
[53:16.640 --> 53:23.360]  documentaries. He hangs out on a 400-foot bow owned by a Middle Eastern oil shake,
[53:23.360 --> 53:27.600]  then goes to a people's climate change march. Well, it works out a similar situation
[53:28.480 --> 53:33.360]  when you look at people like climate activist Bill Gates, who it turns out was responsible for
[53:33.360 --> 53:41.280]  approximately 1,600 tons of carbon dioxide while flights used by Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez
[53:41.280 --> 53:49.520]  emitted 1,260 tons and 1,050 tons respectively. These figures compared to a global average of 100
[53:49.520 --> 53:55.600]  kilos per person per year for air travel, or in other words, the CO2 emitted as a result of
[53:55.600 --> 54:01.520]  flights taken by celebrities and wealthy rich people like Bill Gates are more than a thousand times
[54:01.520 --> 54:08.720]  higher. Similar to Prince Harry, who is of course friends with DiCaprio as well, who is of course
[54:08.720 --> 54:13.520]  friends with Greta Thunberg, who we're going to get into in a minute. Prince Harry took four
[54:13.520 --> 54:19.280]  private jet trips in the space of 11 days while lecturing everyone else about global warming.
[54:19.920 --> 54:24.400]  Was he trying to save the planet when he was doing that? No, he was partying in Elton John's
[54:24.400 --> 54:30.400]  mansion and then they got up on television with him and Meghan Markle and say how much of a struggle
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.840]  their lives are, such a struggle for private jet trips in 11 days. So hard, so hard for them.
[54:36.800 --> 54:42.480]  According to the researchers of this study in Sweden, only a minority of the individual
[54:42.480 --> 54:47.520]  studied had altered their behavior to minimize or stop flying. So out of all the celebrities that
[54:47.520 --> 54:53.360]  they looked at, looked through their social media history, only a tiny amount in the past few years
[54:53.360 --> 55:00.560]  had actually made any effort to minimize flying while lecturing you all day long about, in the
[55:00.560 --> 55:06.480]  case of Prince Charles, infamously once said that you shouldn't take hot baths. These people are
[55:06.480 --> 55:11.920]  flying around the world to the extent of emitting a thousand times more CO2 than the normal person,
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.320]  but they're still going to wag their finger at you. And yeah, I get it. If you're famous,
[55:18.320 --> 55:23.120]  if you're a public figure, you need to travel a lot. That's fine. Just don't wag your finger
[55:23.120 --> 55:28.640]  at poor people and tell them they need to change their behavior by the extinction rebellion activists
[55:28.640 --> 55:35.040]  who occupied the meat market in Smithfields in London, literally lecturing working class people
[55:35.040 --> 55:41.680]  that they were bad for eating meat. Meanwhile, jetting off to daddy's ski lodge in Stard,
[55:41.680 --> 55:48.160]  Switzerland every six months. So the researchers themselves found, and by no means is this a
[55:48.160 --> 55:55.680]  right wing study, it's academics in Sweden, for God's sake, that they had not changed their behavior
[55:55.680 --> 56:01.520]  at all in the vast majority of cases. Quote, their lifestyles are norm setting and identity
[56:01.520 --> 56:05.920]  building above all young people dream of traveling around the world in a similar way without having
[56:05.920 --> 56:10.960]  to worry about money, said one of the academics involved in the study. Once again, very much a
[56:10.960 --> 56:18.960]  case of do as we say, not as we do. And the backlash to this is getting more and more vehement. You
[56:18.960 --> 56:24.320]  saw Greta Thunberg, the patron saint of climate change there in the video previously. Well,
[56:24.320 --> 56:28.800]  now we have this headline stopped the lies mural of Greta Thunberg defaced in Canada.
[56:29.440 --> 56:34.480]  Of course, six months ago, the Germans were putting stickers all over their cars saying
[56:34.480 --> 56:40.320]  F Greta Thunberg. Well, now a mural of eco activists Greta Thunberg was defaced in Edmonton,
[56:40.320 --> 56:45.360]  Alberta, with the vandal telling Thunberg to stop lecturing him on how to live his life.
[56:46.080 --> 56:52.080]  So somebody painted a mural of Greta after her infamous, how dare you ran in front of the UN
[56:52.080 --> 56:58.240]  in September. Three days later, it was defaced by a vandal who spray painted over it with the word
[56:58.240 --> 57:04.880]  stop the lies. This is oil country. This is what he said to CBC. My father has worked in the oil
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.040]  industry. We don't need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business,
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.560]  support our families, put food on our tables. It's absolutely intolerant of them climate activists
[57:14.560 --> 57:18.640]  to tell us how to change our lives and our people. She should go back to her country and try to make
[57:18.640 --> 57:24.560]  her country better. That would be an uphill task given that her country is Sweden, the progressive
[57:24.560 --> 57:29.520]  utopia. But again, Greta Thunberg, when she wrote that letter to the UN, the letter of complaint
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.680]  did not include India, did not include the biggest polluter in the world, China. There's no
[57:35.680 --> 57:42.160]  Greta Thunberg tour of China taking place, is there? And again, as we previously highlighted,
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.640]  German drivers began displaying a few Greta bumper stickers on their cars. You've got the yellow
[57:46.640 --> 57:51.440]  vests in France. You've got the protesters in the Netherlands protest them against livestock
[57:51.440 --> 57:56.960]  reductions again, related to climate change regulation. The backlash is spreading in four
[57:56.960 --> 58:02.800]  wars.com will be what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious. And I'm not talking down to any of the
[58:02.800 --> 58:07.280]  viewers or any of the listeners. I'm just stating the facts. I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I
[58:07.280 --> 58:13.280]  was in college. And it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times. But a few
[58:13.280 --> 58:18.240]  times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick. And I feel like an idiot for not
[58:18.240 --> 58:25.200]  oiling it. Now imagine if somebody told me to put, let's say super glue in the oil container on it,
[58:25.200 --> 58:30.480]  it would seize up forever. But only an evil person would do that. Well, fluorides like putting super
[58:30.480 --> 58:34.480]  glue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up. And that's why they put it in the water. And
[58:34.480 --> 58:38.720]  they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family. Yes, they're really evil. Iodine is like
[58:38.720 --> 58:44.080]  putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication. It's that simple. I know you
[58:44.080 --> 58:48.240]  understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine
[58:48.240 --> 58:54.400]  conspiracy. Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist. Carbons everywhere
[58:54.400 --> 59:01.600]  on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon based live forms. Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm
[59:02.160 --> 59:07.200]  Wilbur Snakeland. I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the
[59:07.200 --> 59:14.320]  Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where
[59:14.320 --> 59:20.640]  they said that to be free from war, we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put
[59:20.640 --> 59:27.520]  chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile. A real
[59:27.520 --> 59:34.160]  terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into
[59:34.160 --> 59:41.120]  how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy
[59:41.120 --> 59:48.080]  theory, okay? There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride
[59:48.080 --> 59:56.000]  and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:32.480]  We are into the second hour of the Alex Jones show in the next segment. We're going to go to Laura
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.960]  Loomer who has had the comeback of all comebacks out raising the Democratic incumbent there in
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:43.440]  South Florida and all the GOP candidates combined in her attempted run for Congress. So we're going
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.640]  to get into that in the next segment. Meanwhile, back in Clan World UK, which is where I live,
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.840]  where we have a 19% increase in violent crime over the course of the last year,
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:58.320]  where we have acid attacks where people literally five minutes from where I live get stabbed to
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:04.800]  death on a weekly basis. It seems almost at this point where we have chronically underfunded police
[1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:13.600]  forces, they are tackling the real problem, which is racist toddlers headline UK police force highlights
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:20.640]  problem of racist toddlers as part of hate crime awareness week. Because of course now everything's
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:26.320]  a hate crime reports of hate crime are going up just by coincidence, which allows the media to
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:32.960]  create this moral panic hysteria that the UK is a racist country. And basically that we've seen the
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:38.720]  return of fascism when it's one of the most welcoming countries in terms of immigration in the entire
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:45.200]  world. Well, now the UK police force created a video which portrayed a white toddler being racist
[1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:51.200]  towards another toddler in kindergarten as part of hate crime awareness week. This was Devon and
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:57.120]  Cornwall police. They came out with a series of these videos. In every single video, the biggest
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:03.120]  racist person was you guessed it white. Devon and Cornwall police posted a cartoon video to their
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:08.480]  official Twitter account, which features a blonde head blue eyed girl racially abusing a dark skinned
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:13.760]  boy. And the video is in this article. In the cartoon, the white girl sees the brown boy playing
[1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:18.720]  with the toy before walking up to him and telling him, quote, stop playing with those you're going
[1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:23.280]  to make the toys dirty like your skin. Brown boy immediately starts crying before the teacher
[1:02:23.280 --> 1:02:27.840]  intervenes. The white girl then says, my father said, we should not play with people like him
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:34.160]  because they are different. It's one of numerous cartoons. Another one features a white guy grabbing
[1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:39.920]  a hijab off of a Muslim woman posted to Twitter by Devon and Cornwall police, where in every case,
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:46.000]  the racist protagonist is white. And as Jack Montgomery points out in an article for Breitbart,
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:52.080]  the cartoons urge the public to report, quote, hateful behavior, even if it isn't a crime.
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:57.520]  So again, it's all in the eye of the beholder. A lot of people on the left think that voting
[1:02:57.520 --> 1:03:03.040]  leave and supporting Brexit is a hate crime. They're going to report that too. Oh, probably.
[1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:07.200]  And then you'll get the hate crime report statistics going up and up and up, which allows
[1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:11.280]  the media to create this narrative that there's a massive problem with it, even though it's their
[1:03:11.280 --> 1:03:18.000]  own hysteria causing the problem in the first place. They also offer assurances that, quote,
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:24.800]  you don't even need evidence. Just denunciations like we had in Nazi Germany. Great. No evidence
[1:03:24.800 --> 1:03:29.280]  required. Last week, we highlighted how a chief of police in Britain chose to recognize
[1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:35.120]  International Pronouns Day, which is trending on Twitter all day, by putting out a video warning
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:41.040]  people that misgendering transgender people was a form of abuse. We've had people, women, mothers
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:46.160]  arrested in their own kitchens and locked up for hours and hours for calling a man a man on the
[1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:51.600]  internet. And all this is occurring while police budgets are stretched to breaking point and the
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:58.160]  UK's violent crime rate continues to soar. What else are UK police investigating? Well, they're
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:05.440]  investigating a transgender person being turned down for a porn role as a hate crime. This is a
[1:04:05.440 --> 1:04:11.040]  25-year-old Rhea Cooper who became the UK's youngest transgender person 10 years ago,
[1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:16.640]  stunning and brave, received messages on WhatsApp from an anonymous photographer who wanted to have
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:22.880]  sex on camera and sell the tape. Lovely stuff. However, when the photographer found out that
[1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:27.840]  Cooper still had male reproductive organs, he said he couldn't work with her because she has a C.
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:32.480]  This prompted Cooper to alert homicide police to this transphobic behavior
[1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:37.200]  and authorities are now investigating whether a hate crime was committed and they did indeed
[1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:43.600]  confirm that a potential hate crime is now being investigated because this man, this photographer,
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:49.600]  didn't want to have sex with somebody who had a penis. Is that going to extend out to maybe
[1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:57.040]  dating websites where you have biological men confronting as transgender women who come up
[1:04:57.040 --> 1:05:01.200]  on dating websites and then maybe if you don't select them, maybe if you're not interested,
[1:05:01.200 --> 1:05:04.560]  maybe if you have a little chat with them and say, sorry, I'm not interested, maybe you committed a
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:10.080]  hate crime. We'll be back. Please listen to this information because it can save your life
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:14.880]  and it can save the life of others. There couldn't be more critical information for your physical
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:18.960]  body. God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:26.960]  your body. If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine,
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:31.600]  they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine
[1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:36.160]  pretty much instantly. Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer,
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:41.520]  dumps us down and destroys fertility. If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine,
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:46.320]  it's like putting good high quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:51.120]  that simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy at m4store.com and find out what the globalist
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:55.680]  hope that you do not research this information. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research
[1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:01.600]  iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything. And then go and take advantage of the 60% off
[1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:26.960]  combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and biotrystallinium at m4store.com today.
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:32.240]  The Daily Caller came out with a big article earlier today which we also posted up on m4store.com.
[1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:37.520]  Experts explain possible reasons behind a 56% jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years.
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:42.800]  Absolute explosion of suicides amongst young people in America and generally across the country,
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:49.680]  there's been a 30% increase in suicides. What are the reasons and what impacts a social media had
[1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:55.520]  on that dramatic spike in suicides? It's a problem that the mainstream media is not talking about.
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:07:01.840]  Now, they bang on all day about a stigma around depression and people not being able to talk
[1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:08.000]  about it. Even though people talk about it more than ever and yet depression and suicide
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:14.400]  seems to be going up more than ever, there was a clip of Jordan Peterson who's had many
[1:07:14.400 --> 1:07:18.560]  personal problems of his own over the past six months or so. Of course, his wife nearly died
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:25.440]  crying during an interview. Of course, his haters mobbed onto that and basically said,
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:29.680]  oh, poor baby, why are you crying? These are the same people, these same progressives
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:35.360]  who bang on all day about mental health awareness, bang on all day about how depressed they are and
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:40.160]  how you can't criticize them because it triggers their depression. As soon as anyone shows emotional
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:46.400]  vulnerability on the political right, they steam in and mob attack them and viciously savage them
[1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:52.160]  as they did with Dr. Jordan Peterson yesterday. So I'm going to get into that later on in this hour.
[1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:56.720]  But for the time being, we're joined by Laura Loomer and this is a headline out of the Epoch Times.
[1:07:57.360 --> 1:08:02.640]  Florida congressional candidate Laura Loomer outraises incumbent Lois Frankel in third quarter.
[1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:09.760]  She's outraised not only outraised the incumbent, she's outraised all the GOP candidates combined.
[1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:18.000]  Frankel, age 71, the incumbent Democrat, raised around $104,000 in the third quarter. Record show
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:26.080]  Loomer raised $154,000 in the third quarter, despite being without a platform on major social
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:32.880]  media websites. Laura, it's the comeback of all comebacks. The enemies of free speech say
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:40.560]  de-platforming works hasn't really worked on you, has it? No, it's not really working. And
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:45.440]  thanks so much for having me on, Paul. A pleasure to be back on Infowars. And, you know, when I
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.760]  filed my my candidacy and my my congressional race on August 2nd, people on the right and the
[1:08:51.760 --> 1:08:56.800]  left mocked me. People said, oh, this is just an attempt for Laura Loomer to get back on Twitter.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.920]  She won't raise a dime. And not only have I raised more than a dime, but I raised more than all of
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:09.440]  my GOP primary opponents and the four term Democrat incumbent, whose best friends with Nancy Pelosi
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:15.120]  combined. And I did so while being banned on every single social media platform and while being
[1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:20.960]  completely defamed and maligned by the press. Every single week since I filed my candidacy,
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:26.880]  there have been articles in the local paper calling me a far right member of the alt right,
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:31.760]  you know, things that are just not true. They say I'm anti Muslim. They say I'm a racist.
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:36.560]  They called me a troll and said that my candidacy had no legitimacy.
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:41.600]  But look, I'm on a mission to win and I'm in this to win. And I am going to win and flip this
[1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:45.200]  district red. And when I get elected, I'm going to break up big tech.
[1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:51.680]  Now, just to explain to people how you've done this, how have you whipped up this enthusiasm
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:58.640]  and raised such a substantial sum of money with no quote unquote mainstream social media presence?
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:03.600]  Is it just, you know, relentless campaigning, canvassing, doing interviews? How have you
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:09.920]  done it without the big, the big networks Twitter and Facebook? Well, I'm working very hard. You
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:16.240]  know, people believe it or not, people in this country won elections without social media and
[1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:22.080]  politics is local. And the left and, you know, these fake news media reporters, they seem to
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:27.440]  think that the world revolves around Twitter. They seem to think that there is no life outside
[1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:33.280]  of Twitter and there is no life offline. But the fact of the matter is only a small portion
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:40.880]  of the country is using Twitter on a daily basis. And while it is a lot and while a lot of
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:46.240]  discussion is taking place on Twitter, you have to go out and talk to people. You have to meet
[1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  people. And the Twitter trolls and the left wing media reporters aren't the people who are voting
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:57.520]  for me, right? There is a whole entire base of constituents. And so they can convince themselves
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:02.560]  that I'm not going to win and they can convince themselves that I'm a loser and they can, you
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:08.400]  know, trash me in their inner circles and get off on banning people, but they're not in my district.
[1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:12.560]  And I'm getting a lot of support from people in my district, including Democrats and
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:18.480]  independents, who are absolutely appalled at what has happened to me. And, you know, censorship
[1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.200]  is totally on American. The First Amendment and free speech is at the core of who we are as a
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.000]  nation. And it's what separates us as Americans and what makes the United States of America
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:34.880]  the greatest country on earth. And, you know, when I'm elected to Congress and I will be elected
[1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:39.120]  to Congress, I'm going to fight for all Americans and their free speech, not just Republicans,
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.840]  but Democrats as well, because that's what being an American is. It's about standing up for speech
[1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:48.960]  that you disagree with. Even, you know, even if you don't like the person who is saying that speech
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  for the sake of having a diverse array of thoughts and conversation. And so I'm really excited and
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:12:00.000]  I'm looking forward to continuing to out raise my opponents. And I'm really looking forward to
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:05.120]  meeting more of my constituents and shocking the nation and shocking big tech and flipping
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:09.040]  this district red. And if you want to be a part of my historic campaign, you can go to
[1:12:09.040 --> 1:12:14.400]  Laura Loomer for congress.com and you can support me. It's a grassroots initiative. So every dollar
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:22.160]  counts, whether it's $1, $5, $10, $20 or the max donation for an individual of 5600. We can all
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:28.400]  make a difference. And, you know, you have to be a United States citizen to donate. But, you know,
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:32.640]  regardless of where you are in the world, you can share my links and post it all over social
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:39.520]  media since I can't. Yeah, I was looking at the numbers about the number of active Americans
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:45.120]  on Twitter a few weeks ago. I think it came down to about 10%. Only about 10% of Americans are
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:49.840]  actually active on Twitter. And of course, only a fraction of those are actually going to be
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:55.280]  politically engaged. So it really is a small bubble when you extrapolate it out to the total
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:00.080]  population. Should you win, though? And obviously it's going to be a task. I'm going to get onto
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:05.040]  that in a minute. What measures are you going to take against big tech giants who banned you?
[1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:08.960]  Are you going to go down the Elizabeth Warren route of trying to break them up? Or are you just
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:16.160]  going to apply Section 230 or amend Section 230 to make them legally culpable for what users post
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:20.400]  on their websites? What route are you going to take in your action against big tech?
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:26.400]  Well, that's a great question. And look, the fact is that we already have laws on the books. We
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:30.640]  don't necessarily need to create new laws or legislation to deal with big tech and the tyrants
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:36.640]  who control these companies. I think that we all know that there are two sets of rules in this
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.560]  country as to whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. And if a Republican were to lie to
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:44.560]  Congress, they would be jailed. They would be locked up for committing perjury. And we have the
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:50.480]  evidence to show that Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pekai all committed perjury when
[1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:55.200]  they lied to Congress when they testified under oath and said that they were not censoring conservatives
[1:13:55.200 --> 1:13:59.680]  and trying to influence and interfere in U.S. elections. We've caught them on hidden camera.
[1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:04.480]  Project Veritas has the tapes, right? We have statements from Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:10.720]  himself. All you have to do is really watch the Joe Rogan interview. And Jack Dorsey has
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:15.840]  perjured himself time over. And again, I mean, he told Joe Rogan that social media is a human
[1:14:15.840 --> 1:14:21.040]  right. So by his own words, his own statements, he's committed millions of human rights violations
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:27.520]  by banning people. You know, you have executives caught on camera at Google and Twitter admitting
[1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:33.120]  to Veritas undercover reporters where I used to work. Yeah, we censor conservatives. Yeah,
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:38.720]  we censored Laura Loomer. Yeah, we're censoring President Trump. So as a member of Congress,
[1:14:38.720 --> 1:14:43.120]  I'm going to make sure that Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg are jailed because they deserve to go
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:47.840]  to jail because they have committed perjury. And it's time that we uphold the law equally because
[1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:53.520]  as Nancy Pelosi always says, nobody is above the law. And you know what? I agree with Nancy
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:58.000]  Pelosi on that. So let's hold Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar accountable.
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:04.400]  Yeah, you mentioned Pekai there. He got up in front of Congress and said,
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:09.840]  Google doesn't manually intervene that they're nonpartisan. Google also came out with a statement
[1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:14.160]  at the time, quote, Google has never manipulated or modified the search results or content in any
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:21.120]  of its products to promote a particular political ideology. On its face, a bald face lie, they
[1:15:21.120 --> 1:15:28.400]  amended the search results on YouTube days before the referendum on banning abortion in Ireland
[1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:34.720]  to make the anti-abortion results of very the anti-abortion results and to make the pro-abortion
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:39.760]  results higher in the search results. That's a direct example of them manipulating their own
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:45.280]  algorithm to swing the result of a referendum. We've also seen it elsewhere. You know, the very
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:51.920]  fact that they promote authoritative sources, who is authoritative, CNN, ABC News, CBS, anyone
[1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:56.320]  who toes the line. So they've been caught doing it over and over again. When we get back after
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:00.960]  the break, I want to talk about how you're going to win this race and what you plan to do
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:06.000]  campaign-wise to be successful. This is the Alex Jones Show live in 4Wars.com. We'll be back.

[1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:16.640]  Hello here. My name is Bethelman. I work for my father Lucifer and he doesn't like the fact that
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:23.840]  God gave you all families and children and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian
[1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:28.880]  countries. We took control of you over a hundred years ago. We've been spiking your water with
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:35.440]  fluoride and lower your fertility and it hurts you and it's worked so well but now because of
[1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:40.720]  liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:46.000]  American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done and it makes me so angry so
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:50.720]  whatever you do just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it to your children
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:58.320]  and don't visit infowarstore.com and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:07.040]  on X2 and X3 together with bio trucelidium from the mustard seed submit to us infowarstore.com.
[1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:13.840]  Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakily to tell you all that there's been a lot
[1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:20.320]  of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you. Now sure the Journal
[1:19:20.320 --> 1:19:25.920]  of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:31.840]  and infertility but after all, isn't there too many people? That's right, drink the fluoride.
[1:19:31.840 --> 1:19:38.560]  Don't visit infowarstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen, iodine. Don't
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:45.360]  give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the fluoride and plunge
[1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:52.000]  into subservience to us. We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:57.840]  Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:05.200]  Remember I'm speaking with a soft voice so I'm a liberal. Oh and let Namble have access to your children.
[1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:13.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:28.160]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your
[1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:43.040]  host Paul Joseph Watson. I'm going to ask Laura about her lawsuit against Facebook later on,
[1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:48.000]  three billion dollars which is five percent of their entire net worth. We're going to get into that.
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:52.640]  Basically everybody who helped Trump get elected was punished in one way or another,
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:20:58.240]  weren't they, after 2016, whether it was lawsuits, whether it was mass social media banning, whether
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:03.760]  it was in fact jail time for some people. I would say that Laura, as I said at the start,
[1:21:03.760 --> 1:21:08.880]  this interview has made the comeback of all comebacks, many people reacted to those bans by
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:14.240]  just going behind paywalls and so forth. Laura said, no, I'm going to get back at you by actually
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  running for Congress, winning and changing the law. Now Laura, as far as I understand,
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:26.240]  correct me if I'm wrong, they can't prevent elected members of Congress from having a
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:31.360]  social media presence, correct me if I'm wrong on that, but if you win, do you think they'll
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:36.800]  let you back on? Well, they should have already let me back on and this is what's so egregious
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:43.200]  about it, Paul, is that I am a declared candidate now outperforming the sitting four-term Democrat
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:49.520]  incumbent who's best friends with Pelosi, okay, and I don't have social media. So I did all this
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:55.440]  while having no social media. I can't use PayPal for my campaign. I can't use Twitter,
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:59.360]  I can't use Facebook. I don't have anything. I don't have Instagram and every other candidate
[1:21:59.360 --> 1:22:04.400]  in this country has access to all those platforms. I'm the only candidate in this country running
[1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:10.880]  for office who has completely denied equal access to the internet, which has a monetary value.
[1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:16.400]  And I would argue that this is an FEC violation because what you have here is essentially an
[1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:22.240]  in-kind contribution from these big tech social media companies to the Democrat Party. And I
[1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:26.720]  don't know why the Republican Party or the Republican Party of Florida hasn't filed a
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:32.880]  massive lawsuit against these companies or filed an FEC complaint because this is going to affect
[1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:38.640]  fundraising for all Republican candidates across the country because we're being shadow banned,
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:43.760]  those who have social media, I don't have any. And think of all the millions of dollars in money
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:49.280]  that Republican candidates across the board are missing out on due to social media censorship.
[1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:55.200]  So this is going to have serious effects on the election. It is a form of election interference.
[1:22:55.200 --> 1:23:00.720]  And we've heard the Democrats try to derail our country with this actual conspiracy theory of
[1:23:00.720 --> 1:23:06.080]  Russian interference. But the Russians have nothing on big tech. And that is why I truly
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:11.120]  believe that big tech ought to be the number one campaign issue, even for President Donald Trump,
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:15.280]  because it doesn't matter what we talk about, whether it's immigration, abortion, the economy,
[1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:22.400]  guns. If you are silenced and your voice is suppressed by these fascists in big tech,
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:30.000]  then you can't talk about these other issues. You can't talk. You can't talk. So we really
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:36.880]  need to do something about it. And I don't know why people like Roger Stone and General Flynn are
[1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:44.800]  being threatened with being imprisoned for many years to come and having to sell their homes in
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:49.200]  order to pay for their legal fees when people like Jack Dorsey Zuckerberg and Sundar Pekai are
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:54.880]  getting away with crimes. They lied to Congress. And so when I'm elected, like I said, I'm going to
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:59.120]  make sure that the laws upheld equally. And I do believe that they need to be prosecuted for
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:04.960]  committing perjury. And another thing too, you mentioned my lawsuit. In Facebook's response
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:10.240]  to my defamation lawsuit, they admitted they perjured themselves even more because they said
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:14.880]  that they're a publisher. Well, they testified under oath and said that they're a platform. So
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:20.160]  what is it? Are you a platform? Are you a publisher? And so if they truly are a publisher, then it
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:25.360]  should open the floodgates for every American who has been wrongfully terminated by Facebook to sue
[1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:31.760]  them. But what we need to understand here is that Facebook is trying to gaslight the press and
[1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:37.840]  gaslight the judges by bringing the Section 230 argument into my defamation lawsuit, because I'm
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:43.840]  not suing for being banned. I sued Facebook for defamation because you and I were both defamed,
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:49.200]  Paul. They banned us and then they said that we were dangerous individuals. And if you look at
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:53.760]  the classification and the breakdown for what it means to be a dangerous individual, you're
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:25:01.120]  either a terrorist or a sex trafficker or a serial killer. And then on top of that, I remember
[1:25:01.120 --> 1:25:05.440]  it was like two o'clock in the morning and I get a message from you on WhatsApp and you're like,
[1:25:05.440 --> 1:25:09.760]  oh, my God, they want us dead. And I was like, what do you mean? And you told me to click the link.
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:14.640]  And they literally declared open season on our lives. They said that it was okay to post death
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:19.040]  threats against me and you because we were dangerous individuals. And they did that the day
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:25.360]  that I filed my $3 billion lawsuit. So Facebook is a bully. They think that as a form of retaliation,
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.560]  they can just say go murder Laura Loomer and Paul Joseph Watson. If they're going to take legal
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:35.520]  action against us, then we're going to declare that it's okay to murder them. And so that's why
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:42.320]  I amended my lawsuit and now it's amended to include damages for them inciting violence against
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:48.240]  my life. And my lawyers just about four days ago, they filed a response to Facebook's motion to have
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:54.720]  my case dismissed. And I do believe that this is going to go to trial. It already has a date set for
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:26:01.680]  next October, three weeks before my election here in Florida. So you're invited. Alex Jones is invited.
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:06.960]  And on top of that lawsuit, I also have a case that is going to be heard in the DC Circuit Court
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:13.680]  of Appeals that is an antitrust case. And so hopefully we can get all types of patriots from
[1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:19.840]  across this country who have been banned to show up to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals when my lawyer
[1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:24.640]  and I get to deliver our oral appeal because it's going to be historic. And I'm willing to take this
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.840]  all the way to the Supreme Court need be. And for anyone out there who thinks that one person
[1:26:29.840 --> 1:26:35.040]  can't make a difference, I want you to know that I'm one person and I'm taking on big tech and
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:39.760]  I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it no matter how much people mock me or how much they try to
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:46.080]  shut me down. Yeah, just to remind people, this is a few months ago, Facebook literally updated
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:51.280]  their terms of service to include language where they said it's not allowed to violently threaten
[1:26:51.280 --> 1:26:57.920]  anyone on our platform unless we've defamed them basically as a dangerous individual, a dangerous
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:02.720]  person. And then it's completely fine to target these people with death threats and to actually
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:07.680]  organize violence against them. They had to remove it a couple of days later. But as he said,
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:13.200]  it was out there for anyone to see completely defamatory. Going back to your campaign, though,
[1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:18.320]  this seat in South Florida, it's considered safe for Democrats. That's what the media says anyway.
[1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:22.000]  They voted 59, 39% for Hillary in 2016. It's not.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:25.440]  Frankel ran unopposed in 2018. How are you going to flip the seat?
[1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:31.680]  Well, it's a D plus nine seat. So Frankel ran unopposed because there wasn't anybody who was
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:37.680]  probably willing to give her the fight that she should have against her. So look, I wouldn't say
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:43.280]  that I'm a typical candidate, right? And for anybody who has been following me over the last
[1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:48.240]  few years prior to me being banned, if there's one thing to know about me, it's that I accomplished
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.360]  the impossible. I accomplished that, which people say can't be done. Whether it's putting illegal
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:59.040]  aliens on Nancy Pelosi's lawn or dropping Twitter stock by 8% and handcuffing myself and trending
[1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:03.680]  number one multiple times. I mean, confronting Hillary Clinton and James Comey at their book
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:09.360]  signing, I am able to do that, which your regular average person probably couldn't do.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:15.840]  And so I'm not going to give away my campaign strategy because the left doesn't deserve to
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.480]  know my game plan. But just know that on election day, they're going to be saying the words
[1:28:21.040 --> 1:28:27.120]  Congresswoman Laura Loomer. You'll see. All right, Laura, stay there. I'll do one more quick
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:31.360]  segment on the other side. I also want to ask you about if there's any pushback from the
[1:28:31.920 --> 1:28:36.160]  GOP establishment. Of course, you're running against five other Republican candidates in this
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:42.640]  race. Also want to ask you about the psychological impact of being basically one of the primary,
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:48.880]  one of the biggest victims of social credit score USA with your banning, which is not just,
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:52.960]  you know, restricting you from social media use. This is what people don't understand.
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:57.440]  You're literally when you do that cutting someone else from the rest of humanity,
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:02.640]  when you withdraw their access to what has become the new town square, the public commons,
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:13.600]  we'll be back with Laura Loomer and for wars.com. Don't go away.
[1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:34.640]  Black Rifle Real Estate dot com.
[1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:11.360]  Only at slingbow.com. Now what I'm about to say is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to
[1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:15.760]  any of the viewers or any of the listeners. I'm just stating the facts. I own a chainsaw. I've had
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:20.800]  it since I was in college and it's a great good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times.
[1:30:21.440 --> 1:30:26.880]  But a few times I've forgotten to oil it and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot
[1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:33.920]  for not oiling it. Now imagine if somebody told me to put let's say super glue in the oil container
[1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:38.880]  on it. It would seize up forever, but only an evil person would do that. Well, fluorides like
[1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:42.880]  putting super glue at a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up and that's why they put it in the
[1:30:42.880 --> 1:30:47.360]  water and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your family. Yes, they're really evil. Iodine
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:52.880]  is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication. It's that simple. I know
[1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:57.200]  you understand this, but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine
[1:30:57.200 --> 1:31:02.880]  conspiracy. Find out more at infowarstore.com and take action against the globalist. Carbon's
[1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:08.960]  everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms. Again, I'm not talking
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:14.560]  down to the info wars audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on
[1:31:14.560 --> 1:31:19.920]  this and I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking about iodine. Now, if you have a boat,
[1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:25.520]  a motorboat, let's say an old glass-tron boat and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to
[1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:32.240]  have a lake to put it in. If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the
[1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:38.000]  same thing. Well, ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:41.840]  nation they put it in the water. They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai
[1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:46.560]  comms don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:51.600]  because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and
[1:31:51.600 --> 1:31:57.040]  everything else. So again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have all the
[1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.360]  documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists are
[1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:10.400]  fighting to make sure you don't. Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com. Here are the facts.
[1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:17.920]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies,
[1:32:17.920 --> 1:32:25.520]  including the American Medical Journal. Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer
[1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:32.000]  and destroys fertility. That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy and then once you've
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.480]  learned about it, protect yourself and your family. The reason I'm so hot on this is the
[1:32:36.480 --> 1:32:41.280]  globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine. In China,
[1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:45.520]  they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people
[1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:51.520]  under their control. The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to infowarstore.com, experience
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:56.080]  iodine and bio-pucillinium that goes with it together and then once you see the great results,
[1:32:56.080 --> 1:33:00.800]  warn others. This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist. It's a win-win situation. The only way
[1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:16.720]  you lose is not taking action. Take action now. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:35.520]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:37.840 --> 1:33:41.280]  We are back with Laura Loomer, Laura Loomer for congress.com.
[1:33:41.280 --> 1:33:47.120]  Of course, banned by Instagram, banned by Facebook, banned by Twitter. And the point is the internet
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:52.720]  is now basically the public commons. It is the new town square. Banning somebody from those
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:58.640]  platforms is more than just censorship. In my eyes, it is a form of psychological torture.
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:03.440]  You're literally cutting someone else from the rest of humanity. And we know from the Chinese
[1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:09.440]  example, the social credit score, where it's going. Bank accounts being de-platformed banned.
[1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:15.040]  We've already had that in the US to some extent. Not being able to buy plane and train tickets.
[1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:20.640]  This is where it's going. It's going into a very dark direction. Laura, you're one of the primary
[1:34:20.640 --> 1:34:26.960]  victims of this social credit score, USA tyranny. Despite your success with fundraising for this
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:33.040]  campaign, out fundraising the incumbent Democrat there in South Florida, just tell us briefly about
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:39.920]  some of the more personal life struggles and the psychological impact of being banned by all
[1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:42.560]  these different companies, by all these different platforms.
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:47.440]  Yeah, it's a really good question. It's something that nobody really talks about.
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:51.840]  And look, I'm not going to lie and pretend like it's been easy. It's been really hard.
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:57.120]  And you, of all people know, I mean, when I got banned, the day I got banned, I came on Infowars
[1:34:57.120 --> 1:35:02.160]  and everybody saw me crying. And just like you were talking beforehand, the left that likes to
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:07.440]  talk about helping people and how you shouldn't bully people online and how bad it is for mental
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:12.160]  health. What did they do? They plastered that interview and they mocked me until it went viral.
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:17.920]  And the young Turks were showing me on screen crying because my bank shut me down too. I mean,
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:23.760]  to the point where, you know, I can't even get a cab or anything. And they're trying to mock me.
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:28.640]  And I didn't do anything wrong. I tweeted Ilhan Omar was anti-Jewish and that resulted in me
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:33.280]  being banned everywhere. And how would they like it if they were stranded in a cab in New York
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:37.600]  City and they couldn't pay for it because Chase Bank shut off their bank card and banned them from
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:43.280]  their online banking. We're talking about real life serious implications. And yeah, look, I spent
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:48.880]  a lot of time online and that was my job as an investigative journalist. And some of my closest
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:55.040]  friends are people who I met on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. And when they shut me off,
[1:35:55.040 --> 1:36:00.000]  I wasn't able to communicate with them. It cut off my ability to communicate with my family.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:05.520]  I was communicating with some of my family members on Facebook and, you know, it makes you feel very
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:11.680]  lonely. And for a time, I did feel very down and depressed about it. But, you know, you can't just
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:16.720]  wallow in sadness and you can't allow them to win. And that's what they want. They want you to feel
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:21.920]  so helpless and alone. And that's why they shut people off because they hope that they can ban
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:26.480]  you and silence you and make you go crazy or think that you're alone to the point where you
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:31.600]  just give up. And yeah, like I said, it's definitely hard some days and I feel really lonely most of
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:38.080]  the time. But I know that not many people would be able to do what I'm doing and it takes a special
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:45.520]  kind of person who is able to handle a lot. And I know that this is my struggle to fight and my
[1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:50.720]  battle on behalf of everybody who is being persecuted by big tech and the cancel culture
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:57.280]  left. And so I'm willing to endure a lot of this pain and suffering that I've had to deal with
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:03.360]  because I know that, you know, I have the truth on my side. I have God on my side and I have the
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:09.120]  American people on my side. And I'm going to win. And I'm going to fight for all Americans, right?
[1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:13.280]  Not just the people here in District 21 and fighting for everybody. And that's one of the
[1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:18.560]  main reasons why I decided to run for Congress, too, is because when I was banned and when Chase
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:23.920]  Banks shut down my online account, I contacted my representative who is Lois Frankel and I asked her
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:29.360]  for help and she wouldn't help me. And here I am. I had millions of followers and nobody has helped
[1:37:29.360 --> 1:37:34.640]  me. Nobody has helped Alex Jones and we're international figures, right? And I thought,
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:39.280]  what on earth would the average American do if what has happened to me has happened to them?
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:43.760]  And so I don't want what has happened to me to happen to anybody else here. I don't want what
[1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:48.800]  has happened to you or Alex Jones or Gavin McGinnis or Tommy Robinson and Milo Yiannopoulos
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:54.240]  that happened to anybody else, not here, not in the UK, not in Hong Kong, nowhere.
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:38:00.640]  And so I'm running to make sure that your rights are protected. And, you know, just the other day,
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:06.800]  I got a letter from a man in Hong Kong and he said that he was a protester and that
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:11.040]  Hong Kong protesters are looking up to me and he actually mentioned you in the letter. I'll
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:16.640]  send you a screenshot of it. And he said that they are looking at people like me and you as
[1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:23.760]  symbols of hope for them in their struggle against the communist Chinese. And so that's
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:29.360]  what keeps me going on the days when I feel really down and out. That's what keeps me going on days
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:35.760]  when I feel kind of sad about being banned and shut down is that there are people all around the
[1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:43.120]  world in worse situations than mine who are hoping that I pull through so that they can, too.
[1:38:44.720 --> 1:38:48.960]  Inspiring stuff. Laura Luma going to leave it there. LauraLuma4Congress.com. Go there.
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:53.360]  Donate to Laura's campaign. Absolutely amazing efforts with the fundraising. Go and support
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:57.680]  Laura Luma for Congress at that website. We're going to wrap it up there. Thanks for joining
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:03.040]  us, Laura Luma. Thanks. Thanks for having me. We're going to go straight to a clip now from
[1:39:03.040 --> 1:39:09.600]  Alex Jones, the AJ Iodine conspiracy. Here is the clip. It is fulfilling to be informed.
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:15.760]  It is fulfilling to know there are serious challenges in our individual lives and to our
[1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:23.360]  species in general. It's fulfilling to face the hard facts because we are designed to take on
[1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:28.720]  a challenge when we decide to actually engage and be involved and have purpose-driven lives.
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:34.960]  So many people are completely empty no matter how much money or how much success they have
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:41.840]  because they did it only for themselves, not for the greater connectivity. Now,
[1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:47.680]  the globalists understand this. The social engineers know how we take. And so they will
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:54.400]  create an artificial system of collectivism where a centralized corporate board collectivizes us
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:40:01.200]  for the so-called good of the people. But really, we're being collectivized so we can be controlled
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:05.920]  and engineered and further dumbed down and turned into slaves. That's the admitted
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:11.760]  globalist program. So I like to pull back and look at things that are really hard to change
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:16.960]  versus things that are really easy to change. And InfoWars has been instrumental thanks to
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:25.120]  your support and launching major initiatives against the anti-human forces of the NWO. That
[1:40:25.120 --> 1:40:31.840]  said though, electromagnetic radiation from 5G, what they're doing to us through the vaccines,
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:37.760]  all of this is a real challenge. The brainwashing of our children, the sexualization of our children,
[1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:42.240]  all of this is done to sabotage the species so we don't go to the next level.
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:49.280]  But one of the ways we can really, really take action is with things that our bodies absolutely
[1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:55.040]  have to have to live and survive. And these are things that the globalists have very quietly,
[1:40:55.040 --> 1:41:01.920]  but in a steady way, focused on to make sure that we don't get them in our diets so that we are dumb,
[1:41:01.920 --> 1:41:08.480]  so that we are slow, so that we are lethargic, so that we don't have that initiative. Because if we
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:13.280]  have the initiative, well then we will make choices in our lives and be involved in ways
[1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:19.600]  that take control away from the control freak social engineer, globalists, the mad scientists
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:26.480]  that think they're God. Now that said, this is how we fund our operation. And I fund our operation
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.800]  with things that I believe in, that I know are good, and that I use. And I cannot tell you enough
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:39.120]  how important it is to realize that almost all the soils on the planet are depleted of iodine.
[1:41:39.120 --> 1:41:43.520]  If you don't have iodine, you will get deficiencies, you will end up dying. That's a fact.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:48.160]  And there's all the big studies, Europe, your US, China, Mexico, there's thousands of them,
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:54.560]  that iodine deficiency causes autism-like symptoms, it causes birth defects, it causes
[1:41:54.560 --> 1:41:59.520]  so many serious problems, very low IQs in children. And if you add fluoride to that,
[1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:04.240]  and if you add fluoride to that, which what's your government's had to the water, and to foods,
[1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:09.840]  then it accelerates that. And our life expectancy is going down in the West, infant mortality is
[1:42:09.840 --> 1:42:15.680]  exploding, we are getting stupider and stupider, our IQs are plunging. And ladies and gentlemen,
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:22.720]  this is being done by the coal-blooded establishment to create a system where the West falls, and
[1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:27.280]  then there'll be nobody to oppose their authoritarianism because all the other nations accept it.
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:31.280]  They never had the revolution that we had in America in areas of England and Europe.
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:35.120]  And so it's a big deal. So I want to just encourage you to understand this, this is just some pitch
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:43.520]  to find info wars. We have the iodine challenge at infowarscore.com, X2 and X3, and bio-truse

[1:42:48.080 --> 1:42:53.040]  chemical activities in your body, your body makes hormones off of iodine, it's just incredible.

[1:43:11.280 --> 1:43:18.960]  I work for my father Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact that God gave you all families and children
[1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:25.040]  and so we want to tell you something right now, Christian countries. We took control of you
[1:43:25.040 --> 1:43:30.400]  over a hundred years ago, we've been spiking your water with fluoride to lower your fertility
[1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:36.400]  and to hurt you. And it's worked so well, but now because of liability and because of people
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:41.280]  warning inside the government what's happening, the Journal of American Medical Association
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:45.840]  and others are admitting what we've done. It makes me so angry, so whatever you do,
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:54.400]  just stay in that haze, can drink fluoride and give it to your children, and don't visit infowarscore.com
[1:43:54.400 --> 1:44:00.160]  and learn about the iodine conspiracy and get 60% off on X2 and X3 together with bio-trusilidium
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:09.760]  from the mustard seed. Submit to us, infowarscore.com. Welcome back to NPR here today, I'm Wilbur
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:14.320]  Snakeland. I just want you to know that when you hear the intro of the show and it's the
[1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:21.440]  Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:27.760]  they said that to be free from war we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:34.640]  chemicals in the food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile. A real
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:41.280]  terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that gravely evil male voice telling you to look into
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:48.240]  how iodine's good for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:55.120]  theory, okay? There's no medical journals, there's no facts. You need fluoride, just drink extra fluoride
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:02.400]  and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:12.080]  Hello today on All Things Considered, I'm Wilbur Snakeley here to tell you all that
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:18.160]  there's been a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:23.280]  Now sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:28.560]  cancer and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people? That's
[1:45:28.560 --> 1:45:36.720]  right, drink the fluoride. Don't visit infowarstore.com and get the good halogen, I mean the bad halogen.
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:43.120]  Iodine, don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the fluoride
[1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:51.280]  and plunge into subservience so we don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride,
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:57.680]  don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones.
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:03.920]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice so I'm a liberal. Oh and let Namble have access to your
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:11.040]  children. Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of
[1:46:11.040 --> 1:46:16.080]  others. There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body. God's more important when
[1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:20.800]  it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body. If people didn't know
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:28.240]  that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned
[1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:32.880]  and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly. Well,
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:38.080]  if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down and destroys fertility. If
[1:46:38.080 --> 1:46:43.040]  you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine, it's like putting good high-quality motor
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:48.240]  oil in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's that simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy
[1:46:48.240 --> 1:46:52.800]  in m4store.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research this information.
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:58.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything.
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.280]  And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of high-quality
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:20.480]  iodine and biotrystallinium m4store.com today. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:32.880]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Paul
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:40.080]  Joseph Watson. The media banged on all day about mental health awareness while
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.880]  and cyberbullying while literally cyberbullying people on the internet. If they're on the
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.320]  political right, we saw a case with Jordan Peterson yesterday. He appeared in a news
[1:47:50.320 --> 1:47:54.880]  interview, obviously very upset. He was crying. He's been through a lot of personal turmoil over
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:48:00.560]  the last few months with his wife nearly dying. He cries during an interview and he wasn't like
[1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:05.920]  roaring crying. He just had tears rolling down his cheeks. And they absolutely crucified him.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:10.240]  It's like Laura was saying in the previous segment, anyone who betrays any emotional
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:15.920]  vulnerability on the right is immediately viciously mob attacked by the same people who
[1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:20.800]  virtue signal all day about how much they care about mental health awareness. Unless you have
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.280]  a different opinion to them politically, then they will viciously attack you like nothing else.
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:31.280]  So we've got this entire narrative about people need to talk about their feelings more when anyone
[1:48:31.280 --> 1:48:37.760]  does on the right. They're crucified. But again, they say there's a stigma around talking about
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:42.400]  depression. There is no stigma talking about it. So long as you separate it from politics,
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:48.240]  then suddenly there is for some reason. But what they're not talking about is social media and
[1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:54.480]  what impact social media addiction has on mental health and depression. And that is studded
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:59.760]  that is considered in this article out of the Daily Caller, which is also up on enforce.com.
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:06.960]  Experts explain possible reasons behind a 56% jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years.
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:13.600]  Listen to these stats. The national youth suicide rate in the US has increased 56%
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:23.200]  in 10 years, according to data from the CDC. This is from 2007 to 2017,
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:31.120]  just by coincidence, the same time period when social media skyrocketed, social media use skyrocketed.
[1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:39.280]  The suicide rate among young people ages 10 to 24 increased from 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2007
[1:49:39.280 --> 1:49:47.920]  to 10.6 per 100,000 people in 2017. Get this, among youth ages 10 to 14, the suicide rate nearly
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:58.320]  tripled from 2007 to 2017. For all age groups between 10 and 24 years old studied by the CDC,
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:04.080]  suicide rates surpassed homicide rates from 2011 to 2017, the report notes. Additionally,
[1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:10.720]  the suicide rate in the US in general has increased 30%. The chances of person in this age range dying
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:17.600]  by suicide is greater than homicide when it used to be the reverse. They talk about anti-depressant
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:22.320]  use in this article, but they also talk about social media. It's a long article. I'm not going to go
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:29.200]  through it all. But they make the point that a Pew Research Center study found 86% of adults
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:36.720]  between the ages of 18 and 24 use some form of social media. 95% of children ages 13 through 17
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:44.320]  have a smartphone. So that boom started after Facebook was invented in 2004. And then, of
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:48.800]  course, you had Twitter, you had Instagram after that. Just three years before the beginning of
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:54.880]  the CDC study, the same year the first iPhone was released and the FDA applied the black box label
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:51:00.480]  to anti-depressant medications for children. Now, this is what an expert says. Certainly,
[1:51:00.480 --> 1:51:05.040]  the timing is impressive. The invention of the iPhone, Facebook, and the withdrawal of
[1:51:05.040 --> 1:51:09.520]  anti-depressants as a mainstream intervention by pediatricians, these are all correlations.
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:14.240]  Another expert said, I think we're going to reflect on this time and think, what were we thinking
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:19.440]  when a child between the ages of six and 16 has a computer powerful enough to run a small country
[1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:25.840]  that can end up with serious issues? And again, it goes back to this point. If you're a naturally
[1:51:25.840 --> 1:51:32.320]  lonely person who feels ostracized, atomized by society, and you're sat there on your computer,
[1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:38.160]  on Facebook, on Snapchat, on Instagram, seeing what all your contemporaries, what your peers
[1:51:38.160 --> 1:51:43.440]  are doing, seeing that they're all having fun, they're all at the parties, that is only going to
[1:51:43.440 --> 1:51:49.200]  drag you down further. There is a direct correlation between social media use, social media addiction
[1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:54.400]  and depression, and eventually suicide. Because again, people are seeing the feeds, the social media
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:52:01.120]  feeds of their friends and of their acquaintances, and not realizing that it's a highlights real.
[1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:06.000]  And in many cases, it's manipulated. They're not having extravagant fun lives. They're just having
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:11.840]  these individual moments, which seem like it's their entire existence when it's not.
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:17.200]  In many cases, the same people posting those images, those videos are just as lonely as the
[1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:22.560]  other people sitting at home viewing them and wondering why they didn't get invited to the
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:28.800]  party. So it's all a massive negative feedback loop. The media will not talk about this connection
[1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:35.440]  to any great degree. They'll only talk about other factors which may or may not even be
[1:52:35.440 --> 1:52:41.440]  as directly related. Because again, as Laura was saying in the interview, most of these
[1:52:41.440 --> 1:52:46.400]  leftist, these progressives live on Twitter and they do not want to see it condemned or
[1:52:46.400 --> 1:52:52.560]  criticized in any way. That is a long article, but it's really worth a read. About the 56%
[1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:59.440]  jump in youth suicide rate in 10 years, it's up on infowars.com. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau,
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:05.680]  Canada's first black president, wants to censor the internet if he wins reelection, which of course,
[1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:10.080]  he did last night, not with a majority government, with a minority government, but he's still back
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:16.880]  in power. That's right. The world's number one blackface enthusiast will decide what constitutes
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:24.000]  quote, harmful content in a bid to tackle online hate and disinformation, unless it's hatred against
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:29.680]  Jordan Peterson for crying in a video, then it's perfectly fine. So they were asked a question
[1:53:29.680 --> 1:53:34.800]  Trudeau's liberal party, which is now back in power. Does your party support the development
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:40.560]  of a national strategy to combat online hate and disinformation? They said, yes, they will
[1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:47.520]  start finding social media companies. If they don't remove quote, hate speech within 24 hours,
[1:53:47.520 --> 1:53:54.000]  they don't do that. They will face massive financial penalties. As I point out in this article,
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:58.800]  according to progressives, hate speech is anything that contradicts their dogma, giving Trudeau the
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:04.240]  power to censor such content as a trapdoor to the widespread evisceration of free speech online.
[1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:10.240]  Mark Stein said, ultimately, free speech is hate speech and hate speech is free speech.
[1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:15.040]  It's for the speech you hate, the speech you revile. And that is the exact point. If you don't
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:20.080]  defend the speech of the most vile people imaginable, you don't defend free speech at all.
[1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:25.120]  He continues, the alternative to free speech is approved speech. And that necessarily means
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:31.920]  approved by whom? Well, in this case, it is the world's number one blackface enthusiast, Justin
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.960]  Trudeau. He is going to decide what is hateful, at least in Canada. Meanwhile, on the subject of
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:45.520]  free speech, Nick Cave slams woke culture as an assault on free speech. This is the music icon Nick
[1:54:45.520 --> 1:54:51.120]  Cave, who has slammed woke culture as an assault on free speech, asserting that it's self-righteous
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:54:58.880]  and inflicts suppression on contrary systems of thought. So yet again, this is another successful
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:05.200]  famous celebrity. The only ones who speak out, the only ones who are immune to cancel culture,
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:11.840]  are the people who have already had their success, the people who are so big, so revered, so well
[1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:18.400]  loved, that they can't be toppled by cancel culture. They feel free to speak out. Isn't the case,
[1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:23.840]  of course, for the vast majority of celebrities who are coming up and are absolutely petrified
[1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:29.840]  of offending woke mobs who then get them canceled on the internet for transgressing the boundaries
[1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:36.320]  of political correctness. Nick Cave said, quote, some of us are of the generation that believed
[1:55:36.320 --> 1:55:41.280]  that free speech was a clear cut and uncontested virtue. Yet within a generation, this concept
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:47.120]  is seen by many as a dog whistle to the far right and is rapidly being consigned to the left's ever
[1:55:47.120 --> 1:55:53.680]  expanding ideological junk pile. He also made some other comments in that article, which I encourage
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:56:01.680]  you to read. Meanwhile, Kanye West says rap is the devil's music. Of course, Kanye West recently
[1:56:01.680 --> 1:56:09.680]  converted to Christianity. He told his pastor, Adam Tyson, that he wasn't going to rap anymore,
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:16.240]  because quote, according to the pastor, Kanye told him, that's the devil's music. He then convinced
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:23.120]  him that he could use his talents for God. He could rap for God instead. Yeezy also confided in
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:28.720]  him that the fame had exacerbated his problems with sinful behavior. He said, quote, the guilt of
[1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:33.440]  sin brought him down low. He would say the devil basically brought him to a place where he just
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:40.320]  felt like he was in bondage to his sin. So he said, I got delivered. Is there any reason why
[1:56:40.320 --> 1:56:48.000]  they hate Kanye West so much? Chinese Communist Party says criticizing LeBron James is racist.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:54.080]  You knew that was going to happen. Of course, he denounced rockets, used some rockets, General
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:59.200]  Manager Darryl Maury, for daring to tweet his support for the Hong Kong protesters.
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:06.080]  LeBron James basically came back and said, there were consequences, there were ramifications for
[1:57:06.080 --> 1:57:12.480]  that kind of free speech. Of course, upsetting or refusing to upset his Chinese paymasters,
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:17.840]  you know, LeBron James will come out with tweet after tweet about injustice and about how important
[1:57:17.840 --> 1:57:23.280]  free speech was during the civil rights era. But when it comes to free speech that upsets
[1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:29.040]  his communist paymasters, then he'll come down on you like a ton of bricks. So they had a China
[1:57:29.040 --> 1:57:36.560]  Daily Communist Mouthpiece newspaper that wrote an editorial saying that LeBron James's detractors
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:42.560]  were using, quote, nasty racial connotations to attack him. Yes, this is one of the biggest human
[1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:47.600]  rights abusers on the planet, a country that literally puts Muslims in concentration camps
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:54.720]  lecturing people on being bigoted and racist. Incredible. Infowars.com will be back in the
[1:57:54.720 --> 1:58:02.800]  next segment. Don't go away. Infowars presents Alex Jones. In August of 2019, JAMA or the Journal
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:07.520]  of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh,
[1:58:07.520 --> 1:58:12.400]  just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility and a lot of
[1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:17.360]  babies dying in the womb and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting
[1:58:17.360 --> 1:58:21.920]  this. You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like
[1:58:21.920 --> 1:58:27.360]  California, unless it's part of adding fluoride. And then they have a waiver and can add thousands
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:32.640]  of deadly chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize
[1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:37.520]  your children. So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:45.760]  in iodine at infowarstore.com. Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over.
[1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:50.880]  Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high poly iodine to counter it. No, roll over and die
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:59.520]  dirty Americans. Infowars.com forward slash show. You probably never heard of preglenone,
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:05.520]  but you need to learn about it, believe me. As we age, preglenone levels decrease with age inside
[1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:11.840]  the body as much as 60% between the ages of 20 and 75, making you tired and lazy. This is a missing
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:17.360]  link with the real red pill formula and real red pill plus that has added energy. You can defy
[1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:22.480]  that test of time and keep your preglenone up for hormone balance, healthy aging and
[1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:27.680]  optimal cognitive function daily. Believe me, folks, all of our information is game changing,
[1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:32.480]  but real red pill and red pill plus are incredible. They're both available right now,
[1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:40.240]  even though they're fan favorites at infowarstore.com for 50% off. This is an energy boosting formula
[1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:46.720]  with L-theanine, caffeine and a whole bunch of other incredible ingredients with the preglenone
[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:52.720]  at infowarslife.com. Again, that's the real red pill plus with the natural caffeine. Regular red
[1:59:52.720 --> 1:59:56.880]  pill just has the preglenone, all the vitamins, minerals together, but they're both amazing formulas.
[1:59:56.880 --> 2:00:07.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:16.400 --> 2:00:22.560]  Medical progress is fighting in uphill battle after they exposed Planned Parenthood's trafficking
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:28.960]  of the heart's brains, lungs, livers and limbs of developing infants. In graphic detail, Planned
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:34.880]  Parenthood's senior director of medical services described how to preserve valuable fetal tissue
[2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:51.440]  during an abortion. Following in the footsteps of Kamala Harris, California Attorney General Xavier
[2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:58.720]  Becara is dangling 15 felony counts against CMP's David DeLyden and the corporate monstrosity also
[2:00:58.720 --> 2:01:05.360]  launched a $7 million racketeering lawsuit against DeLyden and the investigators that aided him.
[2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.040]  DeLyden is charged with chamfering with a government document and offering to buy human body parts.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:16.400]  One a felony, the other a misdemeanor charge that on conviction carry punishment of up to 20 years
[2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:22.000]  behind bars. His attorneys say they'll ask to have those charges thrown out. The sworn testimony
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.880]  that is now coming out where they admit that the videos are true and admit that they've been
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:33.120]  harvesting and selling baby body parts for money for years, that's all coming out documented and
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:37.760]  sworn under oath as evidence and testimony in the courtroom and I think that's going to have
[2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:43.120]  serious repercussions for Planned Parenthood and their business partners as this process continues.
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  Planned Parenthood is a strange animal, a hybrid of a political network and a network of healthcare,
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:54.560]  but as testimony during the CMP versus Planned Parenthood trial reveals, Planned Parenthood
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:02:01.040]  is nothing short of a corpocratic sacrificial temple with FedEx trucks trucking out baby parts as
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:07.920]  if Planned Parenthood was simply a grocery store butcher. As CMP board member Albin Romberg revealed,
[2:02:07.920 --> 2:02:12.320]  in some cases the people noticed that the parts went out before the mother went out.
[2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:17.760]  She would come staggering out later, typically throwing up in the bushes and being helped out
[2:02:17.760 --> 2:02:23.280]  of the place after the baby parts had already gone into the FedEx truck. Romberg then dropped a
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:30.240]  gruesome bombshell testifying, we realize that one for example was a research being done on baldness.
[2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:35.520]  They were scalping the babies and taking their scalps and grafting them onto immune suppressed
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:41.760]  mice and then using various pharmaceuticals on these humanized mice to test the effect upon
[2:02:41.760 --> 2:02:48.480]  preventing or I suppose you might say treating baldness. As Town Hall reported, Planned Parenthood
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:55.120]  violently ends the lives of more than 332,000 unborn children every year. Their healthcare
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.320]  offerings have long been declining yet their financials have never looked better, something to
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:06.160]  keep in mind when they cry poor over the Title X funds they chose to forego. During fiscal year
[2:03:06.160 --> 2:03:16.560]  2017 to 2018, they reported a record income of $1.67 billion, with $244.8 million in excess
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:25.280]  revenue. $563.8 million of that revenue or more than $1.5 million per day came from the American
[2:03:25.280 --> 2:03:30.880]  taxpayer. Not to mention, George Soros has flooded the coffers of Planned Parenthood with
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:37.200]  approximately $30 million, and Soros recently launched a political action committee that has
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:44.800]  given Planned Parenthood Virginia its record largest outside contribution of $350,000,
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:50.560]  according to the Virginia Public Access Projects website. On top of their mounting legal costs,
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:56.720]  CMP faces a biased Judge Oric, whose ties to Planned Parenthood are well known,
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:02.400]  while monsters like abortionist Oric Klopfer, who had his medical license revoked, are only
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:09.520]  discovered after they have died, when the remains of 2,246 babies were found in his home.
[2:04:09.520 --> 2:04:15.840]  How many more Klopfer's are out there preying on those that can't defend themselves? The trial
[2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:32.640]  between CMP and Planned Parenthood will wrap up sometime in early November. John Baum reporting.
[2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:40.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, when we get back from this short break, we will be joined by Alex Jones
[2:04:40.240 --> 2:04:48.720]  with the latest breaking news, as always. This is the Alex Jones show. I'll enjoy
[2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:53.760]  you're now in the driver's seat. Alex Jones coming up. Mike Adams coming up. Carpe Doctum
[2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:58.800]  coming up. Maybe a couple of your phone calls too. We'll see what happens. Don't go anywhere,
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:01.760]  unless it's infowarstore.com.
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:11.360]  Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakeland. I just want you to know that when
[2:05:11.360 --> 2:05:16.640]  you hear the intro of the show, and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation,
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:23.360]  don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war, we must end
[2:05:23.360 --> 2:05:29.440]  the family and masculinity, and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:36.640]  subservient and the women infertile. A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:43.120]  gravelly evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential,
[2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:49.440]  and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay? There's no medical journals,
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:56.640]  there's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride, and then you don't have to think
[2:05:56.640 --> 2:06:02.640]  anymore, and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[2:06:26.800 --> 2:06:33.120]  40 defendants in the Eastern District of California have received sentences of 15 years to life
[2:06:33.680 --> 2:06:40.640]  for crimes against children. 16 have received sentences of 25 years to life for crimes against
[2:06:40.640 --> 2:06:49.280]  children. These are the worst of the worst. This morning, Judge John Mendez of the Eastern District
[2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:58.640]  Court here in Sacramento sentenced Michael Clemens to life. We are very proud to add Mr. Clemens
[2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:05.200]  to the totals that I just described through the investigation, prosecution, conviction,
[2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:09.760]  and sentencing of him of some of the most egregious conduct imaginable.
[2:07:11.280 --> 2:07:17.760]  Specifically, Clemens pled guilty prior to trial to conspiracy to produce child pornography,
[2:07:17.760 --> 2:07:24.000]  attempted production, and production of child pornography, and receipt of child pornography.
[2:07:24.640 --> 2:07:30.320]  He then went to trial before a jury on three remaining counts in the indictment,
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:36.320]  and that jury, after hearing all the evidence and the laws provided by Judge Mendez,
[2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:44.480]  found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of these three crimes. The buying of children
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:51.120]  for sexual purposes. Let me say that again. The buying of children for sexual purposes.
[2:07:52.400 --> 2:07:57.440]  Travel and attempt to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct,
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:05.680]  and conspiracy to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. The only way to ensure
[2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:12.480]  for all time that Clemens could not harm any more young girls was a life sentence.
[2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:20.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a shocking report for you on serious discrimination
[2:08:20.800 --> 2:08:26.800]  and human rights violations that are going on here in the United States that are just stunning.
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:33.520]  Now, again, these violations aren't what's happening in Sudan or Somalia or the recently
[2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:39.040]  liberated by Hillary, Libya, where hundreds of thousands of women have been kidnapped and put
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:45.280]  into sex slavery and where blacks are seen as subhuman by the Arabs and sold into slavery as
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:50.240]  well. That's mainstream news. But if you talk about it on Twitter, you get banned because any
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:56.240]  criticism of the wondrous Islam is wrong. And I agree with that. The fact that they stoned
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:09:02.240]  women to death to talk back or try to drive cars, that is extremely feminist. The fact that they
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:07.280]  cut the genitals off, millions of little girls every year. So when they grow up and become full
[2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:14.160]  grown women, they can't feel pleasure is the way to go. I want to be praised. I went back on Twitter
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:20.400]  and I want Jack Dorsey to know that I agree with his defense of the satanic verses as well
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:29.040]  and Salman Rushdie and that I would I'm ready to embrace Islam. Now, I digress folks want to get
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:35.360]  back to the live show here. The main reason I called is extreme, extreme discrimination.
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:44.080]  Against someone that is attracted to children and that's of course the religion of the left.
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:52.240]  We have seen at drag queen story time events where you have convicted pedophiles and that's
[2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:56.880]  a discriminatory term, according to the left. And I agree with them. You have these pedophiles,
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  ladies and gentlemen, who are convicted pedophiles and they are there with the children at the
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:08.480]  events and now some of these evil discriminators want to do background checks, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:15.920]  before children sit on their laps and quote, ride horsey. In fact, there was even a local Wichita
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:20.800]  Kansas paper that they're saying it's discriminatory to try to do backgrounds at the schools and
[2:10:20.800 --> 2:10:26.240]  libraries when these men dressed as women and big clown outfits come to touch their children.
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:32.400]  I mean, think of the just extremism and bizarre evil of these right wing extremists who say there's
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:38.240]  only two genders and also say that men can't have babies. That's also being taught in textbooks to
[2:10:38.240 --> 2:10:44.160]  young children now that again, men can't have babies. And I totally agree with that. Also,
[2:10:44.160 --> 2:10:48.960]  water can be lit on fire and grass is not green. But listen, let me get serious here.
[2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:57.040]  The real discriminations going on is part of this larger giant pedophile sting and arrest
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:03.840]  that just happened all over the world with hundreds and hundreds of children being saved
[2:11:03.840 --> 2:11:09.360]  were actually in the dungeon pits. Well, you see, they were being enlightened and educated and shown
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:13.680]  something new and shown some new culture when they were grabbed out of their parents' backyard
[2:11:13.680 --> 2:11:16.960]  and disappeared. That's what the moms say when they go to Drag Queen Storytime and have their
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:21.760]  kids ride horsey, in some cases, on convicted pedophiles' laps. And that's why the story of
[2:11:21.760 --> 2:11:27.040]  the Sacramento Bee is so important. This individual reportedly arrested for all his child porn.
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:34.960]  He worked at a baby, a toddler school, a preschool, and he would run events where
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:40.400]  he would dress like a my little pony and the little boys and girls would ride pony.
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:44.800]  Well, isn't that interesting because at Drag Queen Storytime now around the world,
[2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:48.880]  it's all run by Nambla publicly. Another good organization, according to the left,
[2:11:48.880 --> 2:11:52.960]  which I agree with, of course, so don't be extreme. I want to be patted on the head by the
[2:11:52.960 --> 2:11:58.720]  thought police who are good people. They now ride horsey. We can show you some photos of
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:04.240]  riding horsey. So you see, ladies and gentlemen, if a man comes up to you dressed like a clown
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:09.120]  or in a my little pony outfit at a park, well, by all means, show that you're not hateful and
[2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:13.280]  just turn your kids over to him. And again, if you see him grabbing your kid out of the back of
[2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:17.680]  the yard, as long as you're dressed like a big fat demon clown, as long as these high priests
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:23.280]  of Satanism inducting children into torture, I'm sorry, excuse me, I was having a momentary
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:27.360]  lapse of hate, excuse me, don't protect children, abort them, kill them after they're born, liberal,
[2:12:27.360 --> 2:12:32.240]  liberal, liberal, I now follow Obama, I now follow Hillary, oh, hell Satan, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:35.680]  Okay, back to being liberal and trendy, back to being loving and a guardian of the children.
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:39.200]  As long as they're big fat men and clown outfits or in little horsey outfits,
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:44.640]  just when you're at the park, let your children ride horsey. And if you see them grabbing your
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:52.000]  child out of the backyard, it's a holy moment. It's a moment of man boy love association.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:56.880]  And just remember, in public schools from Australia to the US, they actually teach
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:02.880]  in the public schools and in the elementary schools, they have books in the library about
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  children and sex campaigns with men that abuse them. Oh, it's so wonderful, not dangerous or
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:17.760]  anything to have your child grabbed and taken the back of a van or anything. So again,
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:23.120]  I believe in being fair and balanced. So more and more here on here, we're going to give equal
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:31.040]  time to the whole NPR leftist devil worshipers set and just kind of channel what they stand
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:37.760]  for and who they are. So listen to Greta Thunberg and just turn off your power and die in the freezing
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:47.360]  dark. I mean, excuse me, drink fluoride and die and give us your children because the gates of
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:54.640]  hell have been opened and your planet is now ours. Nothing can stand against us. Give yourself to
[2:13:54.640 --> 2:14:01.760]  Hillary. Give yourself to us and bring us to your children when we dress up like ponies.
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:06.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's how sick this has gotten. That's how evil this has gotten.
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:10.000]  But again, they hide it all in plain view. So you turn off your instincts. So you turn off
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:16.160]  your basic survival mechanism to protect your children. And then these monsters just come
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:21.920]  in and they're war on reality and they're war on the family and they're war on God. And the answer
[2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:29.360]  to this is loving Christ. And the answer is asking Christ into you because Christ totally trumps all
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:34.000]  of this. And it just comes down to the fact that there are no atheists and foxholes. And again,
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.920]  I'm not criticizing you. You are an atheist, but I'm just telling you the enemy has an operating
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:42.480]  system and it's Satanism and we've got to have an operating system to counter it. And it's just
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:47.680]  getting worse and worse. There's a revolution of pedophiles and sickos who want to screw up
[2:14:47.680 --> 2:14:51.280]  children. They don't want to just have sex with them. They want to destroy their innocence. They
[2:14:51.280 --> 2:14:55.840]  want to take over their lives. And if you don't stand up to them, if you don't speak out against it,
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:01.840]  then you're signing on to it. And it is a satanic ritual. It is pure evil. All right, back to Owen
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:06.160]  Schreuer who's hosting the next two hours. I'll be back in the office later working on some big
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:12.160]  stories. And we've got so much more coming up as well here in the next few days. So please keep
[2:15:12.160 --> 2:15:16.560]  it locked in for wars.com and news wars.com and band.video. And please don't get this report out
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:20.960]  to everybody, you know, because these people, these men, these sickos are literally wearing the
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:25.920]  disguise of women, clowns and my little ponies when they come for your children. And they're trying
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:31.520]  to make it trendy to have you again, lower your defenses and let them do it. It is absolutely
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:39.600]  an abomination. And folks, that is just one element of the abuse that the left and the Democrats
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:45.360]  put on children. There's also the psychological abuse with all the lies that they tell them,
[2:15:45.360 --> 2:15:50.720]  all the fear mongering about the planet ending in 10 years. So it really just goes to show you the
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:56.880]  psychosis and the sickness, the disease that is modern day liberalism, that they will go as far
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:16:03.680]  as to abuse children to make their political agenda complete. Really sick stuff. We'll be right back.
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:37.920]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to
[2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:42.880]  seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them
[2:16:42.880 --> 2:16:47.040]  ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[2:16:47.040 --> 2:16:52.080]  tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay,
[2:16:52.080 --> 2:16:58.080]  don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:06.880]  website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com. Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries,
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:12.160]  high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms
[2:17:12.160 --> 2:17:17.840]  are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat

[2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:14.560]  I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and I'm talking about fluoride
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:20.080]  and I'm talking about iodine. Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass
[2:18:20.080 --> 2:18:26.640]  tron boat and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in. If you're
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.640]  a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:37.360]  the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation, they put it in the water. They're
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:41.440]  going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water. They'd
[2:18:41.440 --> 2:18:46.800]  execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:51.680]  fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else. So again, learn about the
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:57.040]  iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked and then get
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:01.680]  good iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't. Again,
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:13.200]  get iodine at infowarstore.com. Here are the facts. Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:18.960]  you more healthy in thousands of top studies, including the American Medical Journal. Every
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:26.480]  type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility. That's the facts.
[2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:32.000]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy. And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:37.120]  family. The reason I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while
[2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:42.320]  making sure we don't get the iodine. In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride
[2:19:42.320 --> 2:19:46.720]  because they've already got their people under their control. The globalists are targeting us here.
[2:19:46.720 --> 2:19:52.400]  Please go to infowarstore.com, experience iodine and bio-trustillinium that goes with it together.
[2:19:52.400 --> 2:19:57.200]  And then once you see the great results, warn others. This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist.
[2:19:57.200 --> 2:20:00.960]  It's a win-win situation. The only way you lose is not taking action. Take action now.
[2:20:07.520 --> 2:20:10.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:32.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:47.200]  It's been well documented that leftists for over 100 years in America have been writing about,
[2:20:47.200 --> 2:20:55.920]  talking about, doing documentaries on how the planet is going to end in 10 years. Of course,
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:03.280]  never does. Greta Thunberg will be 80 years old doing speeches at the UN telling you how the
[2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:11.680]  planet is going to die next year. And so it's really just a cult. So Alex Jones breaks down
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:20.640]  what is the climate change cult. In Hollywood, in the comic books growing up, the supervillains
[2:21:20.640 --> 2:21:27.840]  always hold the world hostage and promise to destroy it if you don't give in to their demands
[2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:33.120]  to let them rule the planet. Because again, like thinking the brain says, everybody wants to rule
[2:21:33.120 --> 2:21:38.080]  the world. Well, the Club of Rome, a group of powerful robber barons and billionaires,
[2:21:38.080 --> 2:21:43.440]  back in the 60s got together and they publicly wrote articles about this and said, we want a
[2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:48.720]  way to unify the world into a world government. And to do that, we're going to make people the
[2:21:48.720 --> 2:21:54.960]  bad guys and carbon the bad guy. And then we'll get everyone to accept paying us carbon taxes and
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:00.720]  following all of our orders because we're the saviors of the earth. That's so sick. When somebody
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:05.920]  tells you, do what I say, are the world's going to end? They're a cult leader. They're a criminal.
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:10.800]  They're a threat to everybody. And they use the whole attack on carbon dioxide and the carbon
[2:22:10.800 --> 2:22:15.760]  taxes they want us to pay them as a way to divert away from the genetic engineering, the terminator
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:22.000]  seeds, the toxic waste dumping, all of it. These people know what they're doing. Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:26.800]  they want a post human world. And one of their adherents, of course, is Ted Turner, the founder
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:32.320]  of CNN. And he set up a Georgia guide stones that calls for reducing the world down to 500 million
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:36.720]  people. And of course, these authoritarians, the saviors of the earth, they're going to oversee
[2:22:36.720 --> 2:22:42.640]  it all here at info wars. We're fighting back against this cult. We're fighting back against
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:47.440]  these people that are telling you that you're the bad guys. You've been cast as that. I've been
[2:22:47.440 --> 2:22:52.880]  cast as that. And they are the saviors of the earth. We're going to fly around on their private jets
[2:22:52.880 --> 2:22:57.680]  and live in palaces and have five kids, but you can't have a car. You can't have air conditioning
[2:22:57.680 --> 2:23:03.200]  and you can't have children. This is a way to make slavery cool again, surf them cool again.
[2:23:03.200 --> 2:23:08.160]  And info war stands firmly against it. So whatever you do, remember your destiny is in your hands.
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:12.800]  And when you spread the word about info wars.com forward slash show and ban dot video, you shake
[2:23:12.800 --> 2:23:17.920]  these criminals to their very foundations. We've reached a tipping point. Press the attack. We
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:25.600]  will have a pro human future. I don't think that we are discussing climate change the way we need
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:34.480]  We are in the midst of climate change right now. And it is only going to get worse.
[2:23:34.480 --> 2:23:37.760]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:44.400]  The scientists also tell us have 12 years in which to answer that question 12 years within
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:51.360]  which to act like this is the war. This is our world war two. We have 12 years to turn this around.
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:57.200]  We are less than 12 years away from not being able to undo our mistakes. 10 years that we have left
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:03.280]  to us within the 10 years that we have left to us. We don't have more than 10 years to get this
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:09.040]  right a little more than 10 years from now. There is no justice and there is no combatting
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:14.160]  climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities. I speak to you as a
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:21.040]  human being a woman whose dreams of motherhood now taste bitter sweet because of what I know
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:27.200]  about our children's future. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:32.720]  This is about our lives. This is about American lives that our community will be uninhabitable
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:38.480]  not sustain human life along this current trajectory. I am here to say our house is on fire.
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:44.000]  It's a crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction. We are in the beginning of a mass
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:51.200]  extinction. People are dying. People are suffering. People are dying. How dare you?
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:25:07.280]  Brock and Michelle Obama they are buying a house in Martha's Vineyard. I shouldn't say house. This is
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:10.480]  a massive incredible beachfront estate.
[2:25:13.680 --> 2:25:20.480]  Yeah and of course if the Obama is really believed in global warming or climate change
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:28.000]  or mass flooding or the boogeyman they wouldn't have bought that mansion on the coast of California
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:35.120]  because it's going to be underwater in 10 years according to Bito and according to Ayak
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:41.440]  the bartender. Now imagine if a bartender was telling you that stuff you'd slap it off.
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:45.440]  Well she still is but people are taking her seriously.
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:53.040]  But you know it's funny because if you wanted to bring up manmade climate change or let's say
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:58.320]  manmade global surface change I mean there's obviously a certain element of truth to that.
[2:25:58.320 --> 2:26:03.760]  I mean we build massive cities with concrete and steel structures and everything. I mean
[2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:09.760]  that's not natural. That's not built by nature. So there is like an element of that. If you want
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:16.800]  to sit here and say maybe when human population reaches 500 billion we can't really sustain
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.760]  the earth anymore. That's not 10 years away. We're nowhere near that point. These people
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:26.160]  want to live on Mars in the next 10 years. I mean heck if we can't even sustain life here how are
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:29.840]  we going to live on Mars. I don't know if they ever thought about that one.
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:40.640]  But again it's been well documented how this scare tactic of the world is going to end because of
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:50.400]  manmade weather changes has been going on for 100 years. They don't show the Al Gore documentary
[2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:57.440]  anymore in public schools do they. They don't show that. No they show AOC the new Al Gore.
[2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:08.080]  Al Gore was a white man and it turned out that his documentary and Inconvenient Truth was all wrong.
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:15.280]  They did show it to kids in schools though when it came out mandatory viewing.
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:21.600]  Make sure you propagandize those kids. But now that's the thing of the past. The old white man
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:28.000]  he's a demon. You can't promote the old white Al Gore so you bring in the young.
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:37.920]  You bring in the brown lady. You bring in the bartender and you say go get him.
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:47.920]  She does. She starts crying. She starts crying because she can't. She thinks have kids
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:52.320]  because the world's going to end. I don't think she planned on having kids anyway.
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:55.520]  If we're being perfectly honest.
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:03.600]  But that's neither here nor there. They know it's all a lie. They know it's all a front but they get
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:12.400]  off on the fear porn. But the sad thing is they target the youth and that is the criminal act
[2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:17.920]  that they're engaged in. Because you go around and what do the kids think? The world's going to end
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:24.000]  in 10 years. A.O.C. told me just like the world's going to end in 10 years. Al Gore told me and yet
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:34.560]  here we are. And so that is the climate change cult. Maybe if they wanted to get into real issues with
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:43.120]  how to treat the land, take care of the land, raise cattle, be a rancher, be a farmer. But they're
[2:28:43.120 --> 2:28:48.960]  not. They hang out in the cities. They're bugged people. They have their cell phones attached
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:55.440]  to their retinas. These are the cockroaches that will live in the major metropolitan cities forever.
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:29:00.560]  But then cry about climate change and then take your money and say they're fighting it.
[2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:07.600]  Mike Adams joins us on the other side. If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs,
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:13.040]  listen to me. You don't know me and we'll never meet. I had a problem like you once. I drank and
[2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:19.920]  used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I
[2:29:19.920 --> 2:29:25.760]  needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me. If you've tried to fix your drinking
[2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:31.280]  and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment
[2:29:31.280 --> 2:29:37.200]  advisors. They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:43.360]  and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program
[2:29:43.360 --> 2:29:50.160]  may be covered. Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn
[2:29:50.160 --> 2:30:03.120]  more. 800-506-6740. 800-506-6740. That's 800-506-6740.
[2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:12.800]  Infowars presents Alex Jones. In August of 2019, JAMA or the Journal of the American Medical
[2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:17.680]  Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh, just a little bit of fluoride
[2:30:17.680 --> 2:30:22.560]  in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of babies die in the womb,
[2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:27.200]  and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting this. You know,
[2:30:27.200 --> 2:30:32.320]  it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California unless it's
[2:30:32.320 --> 2:30:37.520]  part of adding fluoride. And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly chemicals
[2:30:37.520 --> 2:30:43.280]  to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children. So whatever
[2:30:43.280 --> 2:30:48.880]  you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters at iodine at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:56.480]  Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over. Do not visit infowarstore.com
[2:30:56.480 --> 2:31:00.640]  and get high quality iodine to counter it. No, roll over and die dirty Americans.
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:09.920]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life and it can save the life of others.
[2:31:09.920 --> 2:31:14.720]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body. God's more important when it
[2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:19.440]  comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body. If people didn't know
[2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:26.480]  that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be
[2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:31.200]  conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly.
[2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:35.760]  Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:40.960]  fertility. If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine, it's like putting good high
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:45.840]  quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's that simple. Find out about the
[2:31:45.840 --> 2:31:50.640]  iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com and find out what the globalists hope that you do not research
[2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:56.000]  this information. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research iodine deficiency. It's the key
[2:31:56.000 --> 2:32:01.440]  to everything. And then go and take advantage of the 60% off combo with our two different types of
[2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:06.640]  high quality iodine and biotrystallinium at infowarstore.com today. Now, what I'm about to say
[2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.200]  is incredibly obvious and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners.
[2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:16.400]  I'm just stating the facts. I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college and it's a great,
[2:32:16.400 --> 2:32:22.000]  good old chainsaw and I've used it probably 500 times, but a few times I've forgotten to oil it
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:27.920]  and it seizes up really quick and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it. Now imagine if somebody
[2:32:27.920 --> 2:32:33.840]  told me to put, let's say superglue in the oil container on it, it would seize up forever,
[2:32:33.840 --> 2:32:38.640]  but only an evil person would do that. Well, fluorides like putting superglue in a chainsaw,
[2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:42.160]  it's going to make it seize up and that's why they put it in the water and they admit they're
[2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:47.200]  doing it to hurt you and your family. Yes, they're really evil. Iodine is like putting oil in the
[2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:51.840]  chainsaw to help with the gasoline lubrication. It's that simple. I know you understand this,
[2:32:51.840 --> 2:32:56.160]  but let's warn other people before it's too late. It's part of the iodine conspiracy.
[2:32:56.160 --> 2:33:00.400]  Find out more at m4store.com and take action against the globalist.
[2:33:00.400 --> 2:33:04.480]  Carbon's everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're carbon-based life forms.
[2:33:08.480 --> 2:33:11.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:11.200 --> 2:33:27.520]  And now the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation. It's
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:31.920]  Owen Troyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:42.000]  Mike Adams joins me now and there is a lot of news we can get to here.
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:50.000]  I'm not sure where Mike Adams wants to go. Let me just quickly lay a few things out.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:58.320]  You've got the left, which I'm going to really delve deep into in the first hour of the war room
[2:33:58.320 --> 2:34:04.800]  today at 3 o'clock at infowars.com slash show and band.video now calling for direct attacks
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:13.920]  on individuals that donate to Donald Trump. Now, I feel remissed not telling you this. It just,
[2:34:13.920 --> 2:34:17.760]  it needs to be said. And we never get the credit. We probably never will. But
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:22.720]  Infowars has been telling you that this is going to happen for months. And in fact,
[2:34:22.720 --> 2:34:28.080]  I went back and got the clips that I'm going to air on the war room today just to show that we
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:32.240]  told you this was happening because they want to make fun of Infowars and say we're fake news or
[2:34:32.240 --> 2:34:35.680]  conspiracy theorists and all that. We just continue to get proven right. But maybe we
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:39.680]  should just start proving how we're right all the time, showing the clips from months ago
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:46.080]  when we're next month's news today. Mike Adams has been covering this. And so part of that
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:54.080]  includes Barack Obama being at a Soros fundraiser yesterday. The racist watch that is literally
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:59.920]  targeting individuals for violence if they support Trump. And of course, you have the news today
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:07.200]  in an absolute uproar over President Trump using the phrase lynching because somehow that's racist
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:13.280]  now. They'll change the name of a building if it says lynch on it, I guess, even though I think
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:22.960]  that's like a Irish actually, like Mediterranean maybe even. But it turns out that phrase was
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:30.160]  actually used by CNN in 2015 to describe what Republicans were doing to Hillary Clinton.
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:37.360]  And in fact, if you pull that tweet up, here it is CNN, the high tech lynching of Hillary Clinton,
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:44.240]  Benghazi hearings. Ooh, but you know, Mike, that's actually odd because judicial watch just got brand
[2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:50.960]  new emails yesterday. New Benghazi documents confirm Clinton email cover up. Her Obama,
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:55.120]  they all knew about what was going on at Benghazi. It really looks like it was actually,
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.800]  they were dealing arms illegally through Benghazi and the terrorists that attacked Benghazi were
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:06.240]  trying to stop Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama from moving those arms. They were high crime arms
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:10.960]  dealers in the region. And so the terrorists got word of it, found out that it was Clinton,
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:15.200]  Obama targeted the embassy. Clinton knew it was going to happen. She stood down. She believed
[2:36:15.200 --> 2:36:20.400]  the evidence judicial watch now has it. So Mike, this is just some of the news that's going around
[2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:26.000]  right now. But isn't it really incredible that the left is now openly targeting conservatives
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:32.080]  for violent attack as they're getting caught up in all their crimes? And I think that that's
[2:36:32.080 --> 2:36:37.040]  really what this is all about, Mike. The Democrats are getting caught up in all their crimes in Ukraine,
[2:36:37.040 --> 2:36:42.160]  which is where the Democrat and Hillary Clinton servers are being held illegally right now.
[2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:47.520]  They don't report on that. Whatever we can get from judicial watch, it turns out the Democrats
[2:36:47.520 --> 2:36:54.400]  are just guilty of all of it. And then Trump says Lynch saying they're politically lynching me,
[2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:58.400]  which he's absolutely correct about. And it's the end of the world. We have to remove Trump.
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:03.760]  So Mike Adams joins me from naturalnews.com. Mike, how do you sum all of this up?
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:08.560]  Well, make no mistake, this is more faux outrage. They're, as Rush Limbaugh says,
[2:37:08.560 --> 2:37:13.520]  they're the drive by media. They engage in these drive by shootings of sorts to try to attack Trump
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:20.000]  over really non issues. Remember, it's the left that calls everybody who's a conservative a Nazi.
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:25.920]  And of course, no one on the left gets banned from Facebook or Twitter or Google, you know,
[2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:32.080]  for calling Trump supporters Nazis, even though it's absurd, there's no evidence whatsoever to
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:36.720]  suggest that anyone said that they're going to they're done policing political speech. And I
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:41.920]  assume that meant I could be back on the platform and they banned me yesterday. Good luck with that.
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:46.400]  Right. Yeah, well, of course, you know, Zuckerberg is is lying. He's trying to position himself as
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:51.680]  being pro free speech as he's destroying free speech. But but look, what's important to understand
[2:37:51.680 --> 2:37:58.320]  here, the racism watch website or racist watch, whatever it's called. This is the transition
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:04.960]  of the left's war against America now becoming a war against the American people. So they are now
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:11.760]  distributing the home addresses and names of people who've donated to President Trump. This is
[2:38:11.760 --> 2:38:17.280]  an attack list, a kill list, if you will. Remember when they went after Sarah Palin,
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:22.720]  for just showing a like a crosshairs target over the districts that she was targeting
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:28.560]  to win in her campaign efforts. And she was assaulted verbally by the media for that. Well,
[2:38:28.560 --> 2:38:33.840]  now the left is actually pushing out the names and addresses of Trump supporters. And there's no
[2:38:33.840 --> 2:38:40.320]  outcry from the left. So they can call you a Nazi Owen. But you can't say that Trump is being
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:46.800]  lynched. And you can't ever publish a list of where Hillary Clinton supporters live, or you'd
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:54.000]  be accused, you'd probably be arrested. Yeah, right. Of course, it's totally illegally obtained
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:59.200]  information. We're not going to get any investigations, by the way. I mean, I'm not going to bash Trump
[2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:03.440]  on this. But there's going to be no investigations. There's no local police, no local law enforcement,
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:08.560]  no FBI, most likely. And so and so yeah, this is why they want to disarm us. Ah, you see how that
[2:39:08.560 --> 2:39:12.960]  works. But Mike, you've been on the power. I've been reporting on this. I'm going to play the
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:18.400]  clips in the war room. I was saying that and they're also taken down the power grid. Remember,
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:23.280]  California just announced they're going to have up to 10 years of deliberate power outages in the
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:27.600]  future. Well, let's get into that. Let's get into that because this is actually a huge story.
[2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:33.680]  Because it felt to me like the PG&E representatives or president or whoever is sitting here saying,
[2:39:33.680 --> 2:39:38.720]  look, the demands you're putting on us are impossible. We'll have to shut down the power
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:42.800]  grid for 10 years to meet these demands because they're getting complaints about these fires and
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.600]  everything. And so it's really a convoluted situation happening up there. And it kind of just
[2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:51.760]  emphasizes, yeah, you know, when you start to move towards communism and socialism, guess what?
[2:39:51.760 --> 2:39:57.440]  You literally don't have power. Well, right. I mean, this, this is Cali's Waila unfolding. It's
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:00.880]  the California version of Venezuela. Remember, when the Venezuelan government took over all
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:04.720]  the factories, the bread factories, the toilet paper factories, they all stopped producing
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:08.720]  products because socialists and communists don't know how to produce anything. All they do is consume
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:14.000]  and destroy. So PG&E is really an extension of the California government. It's heavily regulated.
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:19.120]  It's essentially controlled by the corrupt criminal cartel known as Governor Newsom and Nancy Pelosi,
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:24.080]  you know, all these other people. And they will destroy California. It will become Cali's Waila.
[2:40:24.080 --> 2:40:28.240]  It's already happening. It's collapsing into a third world infrastructure with third world
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:32.800]  diseases now breaking out on the streets of San Francisco, Los Angeles and other places.
[2:40:32.800 --> 2:40:39.040]  This is what they're going to do to the entire nation if Democrats seize power and eliminate
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:44.800]  Trump. And by the way, the other reason they want to impeach Trump is because they know it will
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:50.160]  crater the stock market and they want to market crash. They want to destroy this economy. They
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:55.040]  are willing to destroy this entire nation if they can get rid of Trump in the process, Owen.
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:41:00.640]  Well, and it looks like to me, and again, this isn't, you can criticize Trump. You can compliment
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:07.200]  Trump. You know, we just want to call it fair here. Trump has all the dirt on these Democrats.
[2:41:07.200 --> 2:41:11.760]  And I think it's more obvious than ever. I don't know if you saw his interview on Hannity last night,
[2:41:11.760 --> 2:41:16.880]  but he's basically signaling to the American people is look, we're dealing with corrupt
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:23.840]  criminal people that really I couldn't even begin to explain. And he's basically given them three
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:28.320]  years to just leave him alone. I mean, beyond that, he's even let them abuse him and torture
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:33.200]  him and his family politically, legally, and all of his supporters and even said they've
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:39.360]  ruined people's lives. So he's allowed all this to go on. I think kind of like a noble,
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:46.000]  I guess, leader, if you will, it's reaching a point. And I think the president is signaling to
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:51.280]  America, hey, look, you know, they're, they're the ones in trouble here. All the accusations
[2:41:51.280 --> 2:41:57.440]  they're making are only going to end up back on them. Now, will A.G. Barr take action? Will there
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:02.960]  be any action in Congress? Will there be any action by the FBI, DOJ, and whoever? I don't know,
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:08.240]  that's a different question. But I think the president signaled, yeah, we know that they're
[2:42:08.240 --> 2:42:12.560]  the ones that are actually involved in all this stuff. And if we have to, we will expose them.
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:18.640]  Well, it is absolutely time for the president to have these documents released. Of course,
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.400]  he's waiting on William Barr, waiting on Durham, you know, they're, they're trying to dot all the
[2:42:24.400 --> 2:42:28.960]  eyes and cross their T's and so on. And sadly, they keep finding more and more corruption,
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:34.160]  which seems to be extending. Well, that's exactly it. Let's get, let's get that. Let's focus on that
[2:42:34.160 --> 2:42:37.280]  in the next segment with Mike Adams from natural news. We're going to break here, but that's it
[2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:42.880]  exactly. And there's two things that are the key here, which we'll discuss. Joseph Ms. Food is
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:49.440]  still missing or dead. Nobody knows. And as Mike Adams said, they keep having to expand
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:54.000]  this probe because it keeps getting deeper and deeper and more intertwined with other foreign
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:42:58.560]  intelligence agencies, more intertwined with domestic intelligence agencies and names like
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:03.200]  Obama and Brennan and clapper. We break it all down on the other side with Mike Adams.
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:13.200]  Here are the facts. iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in
[2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:19.760]  thousands of top studies, including the American medical journal, every type of fluoride lowers
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:27.360]  IQ, massively increases cancer and destroys fertility. That's the facts. Learn about the iodine
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:31.840]  conspiracy. And then once you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family. The reason
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:36.800]  I'm so hot on this is the globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:41.760]  get the iodine. In China, they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:46.320]  already got their people under their control. The globalists are targeting us here. Please go
[2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:51.520]  to info or store.com, experience iodine and bio true selenium that goes with it together. And
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:56.400]  then once you see the great results, warn others. This is the Achilles Hill of the globalist. It's
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:44:05.120]  a win one situation. The only way you lose is not taking action. Take action now. Hello today on
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:11.760]  all things considered. I'm Wilbur snakily to tell you all that there's been a lot of conspiracy
[2:44:11.760 --> 2:44:17.760]  theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you. Now sure the Journal of American
[2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.960]  Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer and massive brain damage and
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:29.120]  infertility. But after all, isn't there too many people? That's right. Drink the fluoride. Don't
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:35.920]  visit info or store.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad halogen iodine. Don't give it to
[2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:43.600]  yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the fluoride and plunge into subservience
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:50.800]  to us. We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the fluoride. Don't learn about
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:56.480]  it. How deadly it is and whatever you do, don't support Alex Jones. Remember, I'm speaking with
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:02.400]  a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Nambla have access to your children, huh?
[2:45:06.880 --> 2:45:14.720]  Hello here. My name is Berkelman. I work for my father, Lucifer, and he doesn't like the fact
[2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:21.760]  that God gave you all families and children, and so we want to tell you something right now,
[2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:26.960]  Christian countries. We took control of you over a hundred years ago. We've been spiking your water
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:33.280]  with fluoride and lower your fertility and it hurts you and it's worked so well. But now,
[2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:38.240]  because of liability and because of people warning inside the government what's happening,
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:42.800]  the Journal of American Medical Association and others are admitting what we've done.
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:48.080]  It makes me so angry, so whatever you do, just stay in that haze and drink fluoride and give it
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:55.760]  to your children. And don't visit InfowarsStore.com and learn about the island conspiracy and get
[2:45:55.760 --> 2:46:01.520]  60% off on X2 and X3 together with Biotrusillidium from the mustard seed. Submit to us.
[2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:10.720]  InfowarsStore.com. Again, I'm not talking down to the Infowars audience, but I've been banging
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:15.600]  my head against a wall for a long time on this, and I'm talking about fluoride and I'm talking
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:22.080]  about iodine. Now, if you have a boat, a motor boat, let's say an old glass-tron boat, and you
[2:46:22.080 --> 2:46:27.760]  want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in. If you're a human being,
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:33.120]  you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:37.840]  the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation, they put it in the water. They're
[2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:41.920]  going to teach us Christians to lay down and die. The chai comms don't put it in the water. They'd
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:47.280]  execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water because it's the good halogen and increases
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:52.640]  fertility and lifespan and intelligence and everything else. So again, learn about the iodine
[2:46:52.640 --> 2:46:57.760]  conspiracy at InfowarsStore.com. We have all the documents and articles linked. And then get good
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:03.040]  iodine for yourself because the globalists are fighting to make sure you don't. Again, get iodine
[2:47:03.040 --> 2:47:10.720]  at InfowarsStore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:20.480 --> 2:47:23.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. Owen Shroyer, Mike Adams with you.
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:26.640]  And before the break, I was saying how we're going to get into
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:33.840]  how the Democrats engaged in so many crimes. I mean, folks, and it's not just the Democrats. I mean,
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:39.360]  the Bush administration before then, too. But we tend to view things in a narrow scope,
[2:47:40.400 --> 2:47:47.280]  a more direct approach. And you just look back and think about all the corruption, Mike. Benghazi,
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:54.800]  Fast and Furious, the IRS scandal, the spy gate, all the political laundering that was happening
[2:47:54.800 --> 2:47:59.920]  in Ukraine. I mean, just all the stuff the deep state Democrats have been involved in to try to
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:06.720]  keep Trump out of office and now try to get him out of office. And we're discussing how now that
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:12.240]  the Democrats are closer to being pushed over the ledge politically than ever before for all their
[2:48:12.240 --> 2:48:20.240]  crimes, they're invoking their militant wing, Nazifa, to go out and start engaging in attacks.
[2:48:20.240 --> 2:48:26.080]  And that's really what it is. Quote unquote, Antifa is really the brown shirt Nazis. So it's
[2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:31.840]  Nazifa. But Mike, I'm sitting here thinking about all that. And then I get back into where they're
[2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.880]  going with this whole manmade climate change thing. And Alex Jones really hit it on the head. I
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:43.440]  almost want to go into that where they're trying to make slavery cool. Like, oh, you like, oh,
[2:48:43.440 --> 2:48:47.440]  you're giving everything up for the greater good of the planet, or you're giving everything up for
[2:48:47.440 --> 2:48:50.960]  the greater good of humanity. No, you're not. You're giving everything up for the greater good
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:55.200]  of the elite. And again, South Park just nails it out of the park. I don't know if you saw their
[2:48:55.200 --> 2:49:00.560]  last episode about meatless burgers, but it's the same thing. Make it trendy. Oh, here's your
[2:49:00.560 --> 2:49:07.200]  meatless burger. Oh, I'm sustainable. I'm trendy. It's the same garbage you were eating before.
[2:49:08.160 --> 2:49:13.600]  It's just trendy and cool now. And then they get all the red meat, they get all the ranch,
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:17.680]  the cattle and everything for themselves. So Mike, just two paths right there. You choose
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:24.240]  which one to go down. Well, let's talk about the food issue. Yeah, this processed vegan burger
[2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:30.560]  junk food, you know, 10 years ago or even five years ago, everybody was saying it's bad to eat
[2:49:30.560 --> 2:49:36.400]  processed food. Now they're positioning processed food loaded with GMOs and glyphosate herbicide
[2:49:36.400 --> 2:49:42.080]  and other toxic processed ingredients and taste enhancers and so on. Now they're saying this is
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:48.000]  green and this is eco friendly. This is insane. It's just as insane as a biological male winning
[2:49:48.000 --> 2:49:53.440]  the gold medal for the women's cycling team. It's just insane. Let's get to the psychology of this,
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:50:01.600]  Mike, because it's something really hard to tap into unless you can really get into this deep
[2:50:01.600 --> 2:50:09.280]  psychological level and study it. But the elite see the mass population eating junk food,
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:15.120]  just total garbage food, call it a whopper, call it a Big Mac, whatever. And so they figure, well,
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:21.360]  you know what, the process of making all of this junk food is no good for our bottom line here
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:27.360]  and our bottom line here. And so we can make it trendy and say, oh, you're eating junk food,
[2:50:27.360 --> 2:50:32.080]  but no, it's not meat. So you're not killing the planet. Now you're saving the planet,
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:37.760]  even though it's the same junk food. So it's really an insult to the peasants that are eating
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:43.200]  quote unquote process junk food. It's no different. It's the same thing. Just they get to keep all the
[2:50:43.200 --> 2:50:49.360]  meat, they get to keep all that for themselves and demonize you for eating meat. So soybeans,
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:55.840]  which are one of the main ingredients in those fake meat burgers, soybeans are linked to massive
[2:50:55.840 --> 2:51:02.640]  deforestation of the Brazilian rainforest, which the left is going insane over deforestation.
[2:51:02.640 --> 2:51:10.000]  But guess what? That's how their soybeans are grown in their meatless veggie patties. And so
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:14.880]  they're actually encouraging financially, they're voting for ecological destruction
[2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:20.560]  by eating this fake meat, which by the way is trucked from thousands of miles away. Its ingredients
[2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:27.440]  are. So you have all of the fossil fuel footprint that the left is so insane about as well.
[2:51:27.440 --> 2:51:34.400]  You know, you know what's ecologically sustainable? Cows on a ranch in text, they go get their own
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:40.560]  water, they go find their own food. That's beyond ecologically sustainable. That is ecology. That
[2:51:40.560 --> 2:51:46.960]  literally is the lifeblood of earth. Yes, look, you don't even have to pump water to the cows.
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:51.520]  You just have a like a pond or a tank. They're all over the ranch of Texas. The cows go there
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:55.600]  and get their own water. You don't even have to bring them food most of the time, except when
[2:51:55.600 --> 2:52:01.760]  it gets a little cold outside. So, you know, cows go gather their own food. Cows can turn barren land
[2:52:01.760 --> 2:52:10.160]  that is useless for agriculture into an actual food source. Now, look, I'm not a fan of some of the
[2:52:10.160 --> 2:52:17.920]  factory farming situations, but free range cows totally ecologically sustainable. It is a food
[2:52:17.920 --> 2:52:24.160]  source for humanity. And these fake meat burgers are an insult to ecology and an insult to humanity.
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:28.000]  I've looked at this extensively, Owen. You know, in fact, we're going to be running some lab tests
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:31.680]  on some of these fake meat burgers soon. So maybe we'll break some of that news for you.
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:35.200]  Yeah, no, that'd be great. You should keep keep us informed on that if you want us to send a
[2:52:35.200 --> 2:52:39.280]  reporter down there too, because this is going to be key because I'm telling you this is and I
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:45.840]  don't even know if I'm explaining it well. But it's like a super elitist looks down on humanity,
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:52.080]  looks down on the the droves of humanity, obsessing over fake boobs and fake butts and their
[2:52:52.080 --> 2:52:56.160]  favorite sports teams, they're rigging markets, they're rigging countries, they're fighting for
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:53:01.840]  battle lines, they're engaged in warfare. You know, so the little peasants over here eating
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:06.560]  their Burger King or whatever, you know, that's just that's just tan and fodder for them.
[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:12.640]  So they figure you're already eating crap. I'm trying to figure out a way to explain this, but
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:18.880]  the elite that the stain humanity are looking at the masses saying you're already eating garbage,
[2:53:18.880 --> 2:53:23.520]  you're literally eating garbage all day long. So we might as well just give you our garbage
[2:53:24.320 --> 2:53:29.680]  and we'll say, oh, this is environmentally friendly. And now we're saving you from the cows,
[2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:34.400]  even though again, like you need to have ranchers, you need to have farms, you need to have cattle,
[2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:40.720]  it's necessary. So it's like double timing. It's like this weird double rape of reality.
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:46.160]  And they get rid of the ecology, they get rid of the healthy diet. And then really what they're
[2:53:46.160 --> 2:53:49.680]  thinking is you already eat garbage peasant. So you're going to eat this garbage now.
[2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:54.960]  I know it's so bad. You could almost call it a lynching of the ecosystem, couldn't you?
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:54:00.720]  If you dared, if you were to say such a thing. No, but it's look, it's about an attack on
[2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:05.600]  everything that is sustainable. So the attack on heterosexuality is part of this as well.
[2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:10.960]  The attack on normal sexual reproduction, which is the continuation of the species,
[2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:16.400]  let's be honest, every species that's living out there, mammals, is a male and female base
[2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:21.040]  reproduction. And that's under attack by the radical left. They're now saying that
[2:54:21.040 --> 2:54:26.880]  chemically castrating children is required by the jury in Dallas, Texas, and that if you try
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:32.080]  to protect a child from being chemically assaulted, then you're intolerant. But you have to take the
[2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:37.200]  vaccine though, because of freedom. Well, right. And the vaccine, of course, contains genetically
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:44.880]  modified cancer causing human, aborted fetal cells and genes. So to give you cancer, because
[2:54:44.880 --> 2:54:49.600]  that's good, according to the left. So, you know, it's about, it's about killing everything that
[2:54:49.600 --> 2:54:55.040]  is sustainable. Mike, isn't it like a Mad Max thing where, again, the elite are going to hoard
[2:54:55.040 --> 2:54:59.200]  all this for themselves. They want you to think there's no such thing as two genders. They want
[2:54:59.200 --> 2:55:03.360]  you to think, oh, you can't have a cow or a chicken, you're killing the earth. They're going to have
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:08.080]  whole ranches and farms with cows and chickens and men and women. And they're going to hide it
[2:55:08.080 --> 2:55:12.800]  off from the masses. That's really what this is about. And people, people tend to live in a bubble,
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:16.960]  Mike. And it's, you know, we live in a linear timeline. It's a blink, it's a blink of an eye
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:20.160]  in God's creation here. So we don't tend to understand where it goes.
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:25.680]  Don't forget about the cannibalism factor here. They are putting us on the pathway to
[2:55:25.680 --> 2:55:30.240]  soylent green, actual soylent green, which is of course human, human burgers. And remember,
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:34.640]  they've been talking about human composting for years now, putting that out there where they
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:40.160]  want to compost all the dead humans and feed them back into the food gardens. And now they're
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:45.120]  talking about cannibalism. The left wing media is saying that it's okay to eat fellow human beings.
[2:55:45.120 --> 2:55:49.520]  I mean, gosh, why not? Their demons are already eating all the babies. I mean, they're sickers,
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:55.040]  but there's nothing they won't push. But this is, look, they want depopulation, mass death,
[2:55:55.040 --> 2:55:59.920]  mass genocide. And what are they going to do with all that flesh? Of course, they're going to turn
[2:55:59.920 --> 2:56:06.800]  it into their way, way, way beyond anything related to meat. It's going to be soylent green, man.
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:10.640]  It's not science fiction anymore. That's where they're going. I mean, seriously, though, if you
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:16.800]  put this on a timetable where kids grow up only eating fake beef, never seen a cow, never seen a
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:23.520]  chicken, men and women don't exist anymore. Babies don't even exist anymore. They come from the
[2:56:23.520 --> 2:56:28.400]  stork at the hospital or something. I mean, seriously, on this timeline, we're 50 to 100
[2:56:28.400 --> 2:56:34.640]  years away from that, Mike. And that's what they want to push. It's a 1984 psychological brainwashing
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:41.040]  enslavement of humanity, where we're totally detached from everything that made us what we are.
[2:56:42.320 --> 2:56:47.760]  It's demonic. There are true demons walking among us. It's not a joke, not a metaphor.
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:54.960]  They're trying to turn our world into Sodom and Gomorrah. And they are hoping that they can destroy
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:57:01.200]  everything that is good about humanity from healthy babies to logic and reason to the entire
[2:57:01.200 --> 2:57:07.520]  planetary ecosystem. That is going to be collapsed if they succeed. Remember the stratospheric aerosol
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:12.560]  injection, the chemtrailing, the fluoride, the mass pollution, the bio sludge, putting a human
[2:57:12.560 --> 2:57:17.360]  waste on food crops, the gender-bender chemicals now being prescribed to children. It's sick.
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:19.520]  It is demonic. That's what's behind all this, Owen.
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:27.680]  Let's do five more minutes with Mike Adams before Carpe Dontham joins me. It's just, it is 1984 in
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:32.080]  the flesh. And I don't know, Mike. I mean, maybe it's something that... I mean, I just see it in
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:37.440]  my head, Mike. I literally see where it's going. I can doctor strange this out. And I see where it
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:43.280]  goes from here. Children will grow up thinking, we saved the planet because we quit eating cows
[2:57:43.280 --> 2:57:49.200]  or chickens. And so now they don't exist anymore. And we saved the planet and got rid of bigotry
[2:57:49.200 --> 2:57:52.560]  because there's no sexes or genders or babies anymore. I mean, that's where it goes.
[2:57:54.240 --> 2:57:59.920]  It is now an admitted fact. Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans
[2:57:59.920 --> 2:58:05.440]  to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs. And it doesn't matter if the Journal
[2:58:05.440 --> 2:58:10.240]  of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put in the water
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:15.120]  because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid. And they sure don't
[2:58:15.120 --> 2:58:22.320]  want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility and
[2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:27.520]  makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything. Thank God.
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:31.680]  Thank God. I discovered this eight years ago. Of course, the enemy knows all about it and they
[2:58:31.680 --> 2:58:35.840]  hope you don't discover it. They hope you just roll over and die. So whatever you do, don't visit

[2:58:58.560 --> 2:59:03.280]  and it can save the life of others. There couldn't be more critical information for your physical
[2:59:03.280 --> 2:59:07.280]  body. God's more important when it comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes
[2:59:07.280 --> 2:59:14.720]  to your body. If people didn't know that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the
[2:59:14.720 --> 2:59:19.360]  engine, they might be able to be conned and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up
[2:59:19.360 --> 2:59:24.560]  the engine pretty much instantly. Well, if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer,
[2:59:24.560 --> 2:59:30.000]  dumbs us down and destroys fertility. If you put the good halogen in the body, high quality iodine,
[2:59:30.000 --> 2:59:34.960]  it's like putting good high quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's that
[2:59:34.960 --> 2:59:39.520]  simple. Find out about the iodine conspiracy at infoorstore.com and find out what the globalist
[2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:44.160]  hope that you do not research this information. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do, research
[2:59:44.160 --> 2:59:50.080]  iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything. And then go and take advantage of the 60% off
[2:59:50.080 --> 3:00:05.520]  combo with our two different types of high quality iodine and biotrystallinium and infoorstore.com today.
[3:00:05.520 --> 3:00:12.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance. And now
[3:00:12.640 --> 3:00:24.400]  your host, Owen Troyer.
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:27.520]  All right, I just want to get Mike Adams' take on this without me interrupting.
[3:00:28.480 --> 3:00:32.400]  It's just, it's so frustrating because I don't even think I can coherently or eloquently
[3:00:34.080 --> 3:00:41.040]  put into words the visions in my head for where this goes, Mike. But it's been written in 1984,
[3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:46.720]  it's been written in Animal Farm. It's been written by a brave new world, the brave new world
[3:00:46.720 --> 3:00:52.240]  revisited. I mean, so it's divisions are already out there and we've already, we've all been through
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:56.560]  this. We're all connected, Mike. So, so we're just tapping into that. I guess you could say
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:02.000]  because we're healthy individuals that have connection to our pineal gland and we have connection
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:10.320]  to our gut and the history of our lineage. And so we remember all of that. But Mike, we see what
[3:01:10.320 --> 3:01:15.120]  they're doing. Oh, the planet's going into 10 years. Oh, cows and farmers, they're the problem.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:23.680]  So eat fake beef. You know, oh, it's there's 76 genders. Oh, men can have babies. Men can have
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:30.480]  periods. It's all distorting, blurring the lines of reality. And I'm just trying to envision what
[3:01:30.480 --> 3:01:36.640]  is the world going to be like for a kid growing up in 50 years? And it's not going to be the world.
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:43.600]  It's going to be if the leftist trend catches, catches ground and goes global like the plan was
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:48.000]  and we don't resist this. In 50 years, children are not going to hear they're not going to know
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.720]  anything what a boy is what a girl is what a cow is. It'll all be demonized. There will be no such
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:57.840]  thing as pregnancies. I mean, you say, oh, that's extreme. Well, that's where this goes, Mike. That's
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:04.160]  the trend. These things don't even stop. They won't even know what human is. So here's a little
[3:02:04.160 --> 3:02:08.320]  snippet of what you're going to see in the near future. You'll have a woke progressive couple
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:15.360]  that has a baby and they claim the baby is a panda because pandas are an endangered species. So they
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:23.680]  will raise a human boy as a female panda. So you'll have actual transgender trans species children
[3:02:24.240 --> 3:02:30.160]  who are raised by progressive parents who think they're saving the world from species extinction.
[3:02:30.160 --> 3:02:34.640]  And what they're doing is, of course, completely insane. They should be an insane
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:40.720]  asylums, but they will treat their human child as a panda and they will feed it like a panda's
[3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:44.880]  diet, you know, and they'll have it injected with panda hormones. You see where I'm going?
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:50.400]  This is this is exactly what's happening right now. Just one step further with cross species
[3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:56.960]  ism, if you will. That's what's coming. And if you are opposed to it, Owen, you are an intolerant
[3:02:56.960 --> 3:03:03.360]  anti-panda bigot. Just by the way, I'm the first to tell you that, by the way, you are an anti-panda
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:09.040]  bigot. I can see it in your future. You're opposed to turning human babies into pandas. Shame on you.
[3:03:09.040 --> 3:03:15.520]  But that's kind of what's coming. And the ones they don't turn into pandas and eagles and field
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:22.000]  mice and whatever, they will just eat them for the non meat burgers. So Soylent green is coming,
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:27.040]  mass insanity, and dogs and cats living together. Right. Total chaos. That's what's coming. It's no
[3:03:27.040 --> 3:03:32.160]  joke. We can make fun of it, but it's really happening. It's coming, Owen. But that's the
[3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:36.720]  thing too. If they roll, they'll roll out the microchips and make that trendy. And whatever
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:41.840]  they release to the public won't be the real thing. You'll just die and get logged into some machine,
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:46.080]  you know, for your, for your, your energy or whatever it is.
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:52.160]  But Mike, it's, it, I'm sitting here. I don't know if you, Matt Groening has a
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:57.760]  unbelievable ability to somehow predict the future in his cartoons. And hearing you talk about that,
[3:03:57.760 --> 3:04:02.160]  I'm thinking about Futurama. I don't know if you've ever seen it. You know, there's all these
[3:04:02.160 --> 3:04:08.000]  different species on earth in Futurama in the year 3000. I'm thinking to think maybe they're
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:13.440]  all just human, but they're just cross species so genetically modified in a thousand years,
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:17.840]  a human will be such a rare thing. It'll be almost extinct. You won't even be able to find a human
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:23.760]  anymore. Yeah. Well, they despise humanity. This is what's key to understand because they are
[3:04:23.760 --> 3:04:29.200]  demonic. They despise any biological being who is created in the image of God. So this is about
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:34.880]  destroying life, destroying God, destroying creativity, light and truth. Ultimately, this is
[3:04:34.880 --> 3:04:39.440]  very philosophical, but I know you know that. Yeah. And at a deeper level, Mike, I mean, look,
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:46.240]  I've only been on this planet 30 years. I just wonder how many lines of reality have been distorted
[3:04:46.240 --> 3:04:51.120]  on this earth to get us where we're at now? Like, I mean, I can't even, I can't even fathom.
[3:04:51.120 --> 3:04:54.480]  I really can't even fathom. I don't think it's as bad as it could be. But all right, Mike, thank
[3:04:54.480 --> 3:04:58.880]  you so much for joining us. Mike Adams, great stuff as always. You can find his content at
[3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:08.560]  bandoutvideonaturalnews.com. Welcome back to NPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakeland. I just want
[3:05:08.560 --> 3:05:13.120]  you to know that when you hear the intro of the show, and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:19.280]  the Carnegie Foundation, don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that
[3:05:19.280 --> 3:05:25.280]  to be free from war, we must end the family and masculinity and that we must put chemicals in the
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:32.960]  food and water to make the men subservient and the women infertile. A real terrorist, Alex Jones,
[3:05:32.960 --> 3:05:39.120]  has been on air with that gravelly evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good
[3:05:39.120 --> 3:05:46.080]  for your body and essential and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay?
[3:05:46.080 --> 3:05:51.920]  There's no medical journals. There's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride
[3:05:51.920 --> 3:06:02.880]  and then you don't have to think anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:30.880]  We're into the fourth and final hour of the Alex Jones show today. We're about to be joined by

[3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:33.520]  Dantum here on the Alex Jones show. And he makes the memes that make the left go bananas.
[3:08:34.160 --> 3:08:39.360]  And so right now they're obsessing over some meme now saying is hateful. So what is the latest?
[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:42.160]  What is the latest thought crime you have engaged in Carpe?
[3:08:44.000 --> 3:08:50.480]  So the latest thing is media matters. Media matters wrote a hit piece on on meme world.
[3:08:50.480 --> 3:08:56.400]  Um, they're, they're accusing guys actually let's give them a round of applause. Yeah.
[3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:04.800]  Great job. Great job to memeworld.com. Great job to Carpe Dantum. Who else makes the memes over
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:12.240]  there? Uh, you know, we've got mad liberals. We've got soul memes. We've got, uh, Trollosaurus Rex.
[3:09:12.240 --> 3:09:18.240]  We have all the shouts. Give them all the love. Let's see. Um, who we got Ben Garrison over there.
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:24.320]  We've got, uh, let's see Geeks Squad or the Geeks team that, uh, gotten so much trouble.
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:26.400]  Well, congratulations. I got my stuff. Everybody else.
[3:09:26.400 --> 3:09:30.000]  Congratulations to everybody over at memeworld.com for making this possible.
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.480]  Once you get the media matters hit piece, you know, you've made it.
[3:09:33.120 --> 3:09:37.360]  Exactly. Uh, if you're, if you're not getting attacked by media matters, you're not doing
[3:09:37.360 --> 3:09:41.360]  your job is what I say. So go harder if you haven't got attacked by media matters.
[3:09:42.480 --> 3:09:47.280]  So they are, they're accusing, uh, the website of, well, first of all, being filled with violent
[3:09:47.280 --> 3:09:53.680]  content, which I mean, there's some violent content on there, but, um, they're attacking
[3:09:53.680 --> 3:09:59.760]  one of my favorite part of, of the article is when they, uh, talk about how the site is
[3:09:59.760 --> 3:10:05.760]  anti-Semitic because I have a, a video up there, uh, of a rat stealing someone's wallet
[3:10:05.760 --> 3:10:10.640]  and Bernie Sanders head is put on the rat. Uh, so apparently since he's Jewish, that's, uh,
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:14.320]  that's clearly an anti-Semitic, uh, trope or whatever.
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:20.160]  So it has nothing to do with, uh, him being socialist and stealing money from, uh, people
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:25.040]  for himself, but, uh, wait a second. That they're the anti-Semites for associating that with, with
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:33.440]  Jews. Exactly. Like, media matters is anti-Semitic towards Jews. Apparently. I mean, like,
[3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:37.360]  how else could you take that? Like, no, seriously, no, no, no. Carbay,
[3:10:37.360 --> 3:10:41.360]  why does media matters hate Jewish people? I don't know. I mean,
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:48.240]  it's, I can't see a good reason why they would, but devastated right now by media matters blatant
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:54.720]  bigotry towards Jewish people to even compare the plights of socialism, uh, to I'm not mad.
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:10:58.480]  I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed. I'm disappointed in media matters. You know,
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:02.480]  I just have to, I just have to say that I really thought they were better than this,
[3:11:02.480 --> 3:11:06.800]  but apparently not media matters. You're better than that. Your mother used to tell you that
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:12.880]  you're better than that. Be best. Be best media matters. Well, I'm glad we got that out of the
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:16.960]  way. So you're not even allowed, but here's the thing. See, it's like you said, like, okay,
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:20.640]  yeah, there's, there's some violent content on there. You're not, you're not denying reality.
[3:11:20.640 --> 3:11:26.800]  They put out crap showing Trump getting killed. It's like an annual ritual for them, but oh my
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:32.080]  gosh, it's a weekly, weekly ritual. It's, it's not annual, but they deny it. They act like they
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:39.360]  don't do it. Right. I mean, last week we had, uh, I think there was two really solid instances.
[3:11:39.360 --> 3:11:50.640]  One was, uh, um, oh, uh, Nancy Pelosi's, uh, high heel shoe. Right. And then Tom, Tom Arnold, uh,
[3:11:50.640 --> 3:11:57.920]  was talking about the JFK assassinations. Oh, Hillary Clinton also sent that fake JFK letter.
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:03.760]  Right. But well, Thomas was worse because he was like, uh, people showed up for JFK too. And,
[3:12:03.760 --> 3:12:10.000]  you know, well, this is when Trump is in Dallas. Um, seriously, you know, Tom Arnold, I almost
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:14.400]  feel like we should say a prayer. I mean, heroin or whatever this guy's on, he needs help.
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:18.800]  He does. He really does need help. Yeah. See the, the, the, what you're showing right now,
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:24.080]  this is anti-Semitism and now you're guilty of it too. I get it though. I get it. So,
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:28.320]  but that's the funny thing is it's media matters that sees this and they think, wow,
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:35.200]  you just depicted a Jew going into your person stealing a dollar. Right. But really, it's a
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:40.880]  socialist. The title even says socialist. It's not, it's, it's not like it evens, like, if we
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:44.720]  were trying to be anti-Semitic, it would say Jew steals money or something. Like, I like, what,
[3:12:44.720 --> 3:12:47.600]  what is it? Let's say you even did do that. So what?
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:54.000]  Socialist Bernie Sanders to steal your money right out of your purse. That's, that is,
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:58.640]  you can't make jokes anymore. No, and he can't, he can't. You know who does the,
[3:12:58.640 --> 3:13:07.600]  you know who does a lot of good Jew jokes? Who's that? South Park. God, we're back to that already.
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:11.680]  Before we do that, I want to, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. A friend of mine made this.
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:17.600]  Me and America great again. That's, that's what we're going to do.
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:26.160]  Is that a new hat you've made? It's a brick suit made it. Have you seen that guy? He runs around,
[3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:32.080]  goes to Trump rallies and he wears this suit that looks like a brick wall. I don't think I have.
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:36.880]  I'm surprised, but I don't believe I have. At some point, he was up on stage with Trump.
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:42.320]  Oh, sometimes the last year, but anyway, he's one of the contributors at the site too. So.
[3:13:43.040 --> 3:13:46.480]  Hey, what do you think about this? You've already been targeted by the left.
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:50.400]  Have you seen this new thing? They've launched a website now
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:56.720]  where they're literally doxing people publicly. Oh, I know. You've seen this?
[3:13:56.720 --> 3:14:00.960]  I've seen it. I've seen it. That's insane. I was just talking to Jack about that yesterday that,
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:07.280]  like, like, I think we're all surprised that it took this long for them to make a website where
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:13.280]  they just, you know, blatantly dox anybody that's ever donated. Well, it's been in the works for
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:18.800]  a while. I think that right now, the Democrats are so desperate now. And really, they, their
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:22.240]  plans have actually been exposed so many times. I think they've been putting it off,
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:27.520]  but you had Obama at the Soros fundraiser yesterday, the same day they saw their website.
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:35.040]  So it's all very coordinated. Yeah, he was at what? Alex's Alex Soros or whatever, his fund
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:43.840]  raiser? Yeah, he's there. It's Alex Soros, Terry McCullough, Eric Holder. And so they're all at
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:50.560]  the Soros fundraiser. Do you know what the fundraiser was for? Evil and bigotry? I don't know.
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:56.800]  No, no, no, but get this. It's for redistricting New York. So why do McCullough or Holder or Obama
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:15:01.040]  even even have any interest in that? So there's something else. Why would you need to redistrict
[3:15:01.600 --> 3:15:06.000]  New York? There's something else. Well, the Democrats are constantly engaged in gerrymandering.
[3:15:07.040 --> 3:15:11.200]  Right. But I mean, there's they have solid control over New York. I don't even know why
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:15.680]  they would need to bother. But I mean, maybe they're afraid of Trump getting some New York
[3:15:15.680 --> 3:15:20.320]  votes or something, or maybe they're trying to keep AOC in office by redistricting. I don't know.
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:23.120]  I don't think that's really what it's about. I think that's a front.
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:30.800]  Yeah. To have Obama and Holder and McCullough there for redistricting of New York, it just
[3:15:30.800 --> 3:15:34.880]  doesn't add up to me. You know, we're not we're not allowed to have this conversation right now,
[3:15:34.880 --> 3:15:42.000]  because this is an anti-Semitic conversation because George Soros is as true. So I mean,
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:46.560]  you've just completely just killed. Hold on, guys. Show that picture again with Obama and Soros.
[3:15:46.560 --> 3:15:52.800]  This is unbelievable. Look at this. Two white guys, two white guys meeting in New York.
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:58.160]  And no, that was a racist show. No, no, look, there's two white guys right there
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:01.280]  to redistrict New York. I'm sick of these white guys. I'm sick of all of them.
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:06.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to
[3:16:06.000 --> 3:16:10.960]  seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS and won. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them
[3:16:10.960 --> 3:16:15.120]  ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:20.160]  tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes, you can't pay,
[3:16:20.160 --> 3:16:25.760]  don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX or
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:31.600]  go to my website, danpilla.com. That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:38.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:43.600]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:50.720]  World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[3:16:50.720 --> 3:16:56.240]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I,
[3:16:56.240 --> 3:17:01.040]  the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:05.200]  One of the most frequently asked questions we get in customer service is,
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:11.280]  what is the real red pill? And what is the real red pill plus? Well, real red pill is a vitamin,
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:17.200]  mineral, multivitamin, high quality with preglonone. Real red pill plus is the same thing
[3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:22.960]  with a little bit of clean, added energy on top of it as well. That kicks in in 30 minutes.
[3:17:22.960 --> 3:17:29.360]  But the preglonone kicks in in about a week or so. Folks, look into preglonone for yourself,
[3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:33.520]  look into high-end sources of it like real red pill and real red pill plus,
[3:17:33.520 --> 3:17:37.920]  and then you'll definitely want to try it out and see the effects you get within about seven
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:42.800]  days to two weeks, generally. But believe me, it's a missing link. You need to find out about it
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:48.320]  as we age. Preglonone levels go down. All of our hormones in our body are manufactured by the body
[3:17:48.320 --> 3:17:54.720]  using preglonone. You need to learn about preglonone and then you need to get the real red pill or
[3:17:54.720 --> 3:18:00.400]  the real red pill plus. Now, 50% off at infowarslife.com, the real red pill plus.
[3:18:00.400 --> 3:18:08.880]  It is now an admitted fact. Fluoride out of the water has caused tens of millions of Americans
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:14.400]  to be brain damaged and to have infertility and low IQs. And it doesn't matter if the Journal
[3:18:14.400 --> 3:18:18.640]  of American Medical Association comes out and says it's terrible, still the city's put it in the
[3:18:18.640 --> 3:18:23.840]  water because the ruling globalists want you and your family poisoned and stupid. And they sure
[3:18:23.840 --> 3:18:31.120]  don't want you to know about the good allergen iodine that absolutely increases IQ and fertility
[3:18:31.120 --> 3:18:35.040]  and makes life so wonderful and opens up your consciousness, your mind, everything.

[3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:14.000]  or the Journal of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:19.440]  gosh, just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lower IQs, massive infertility and a lot
[3:19:19.440 --> 3:19:24.480]  of babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting
[3:19:24.480 --> 3:19:29.760]  this. You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like California
[3:19:29.760 --> 3:19:34.960]  unless it's part of adding fluoride. And then they have a waiver and can add thousands of deadly
[3:19:34.960 --> 3:19:40.800]  chemicals to your water because the liberals love you and they want to sexualize your children.
[3:19:40.800 --> 3:19:45.440]  So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride and don't get the thing that counters the iodine
[3:19:45.440 --> 3:19:52.800]  at infowarsstore.com. Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride dirty Americans and roll over.

[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:22.160]  Donkton, meme legend. I've got to just do this on air. I'm going to be that guy.
[3:21:22.160 --> 3:21:27.680]  Can I be that guy for a segment, Carpe? Go ahead and be that guy. I got to be that guy.
[3:21:27.680 --> 3:21:33.440]  He already knows that guy because he deals with that guy all the time. Guys, I've got a new meme
[3:21:33.440 --> 3:21:38.880]  idea for Carpe Donkton. And because so the Democrats are all panicked over this lynching
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:45.600]  comment, there's a whole ABC news thread. It's like 30 tweets long of all the Republicans
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:51.840]  and Democrats and all these people disavowing Trump's lynching comments. So there's memes galore
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:54.800]  to be made, I think here. But I've got the meme for you. Are you ready?
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:22:00.640]  I'm so ready. I'm going to be that guy. I know you love this. It's your favorite part of the day.
[3:22:01.600 --> 3:22:05.120]  So I don't know if you've seen the movie, The Ridiculous Six, but there's a scene where
[3:22:05.120 --> 3:22:11.200]  Taylor Lautner's character is being lynched and they can't kill him. And so he's literally swinging
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:17.680]  from the news, dancing, doing the running man, laughing, having a good time. So I think, play
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:24.640]  the video, you put Trump's face on Taylor Lautner's character and then you have Pelosi and Schumer and
[3:22:24.640 --> 3:22:30.560]  Schiff all next to him doing the hanging and Brennan. And so there's Trump right there. He's
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:36.320]  laughing, having a good time. And Schiff pulls the lever and all the Democrats and the media cheer
[3:22:36.320 --> 3:22:42.880]  and they're all happy. And oh my gosh, they got Trump. Except no, he's laughing. He's not,
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:46.240]  they can't get him. And so now they're shocked. They're like, what's going on here? And then
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:52.400]  Trump does a dance. He's making jokes. And the media doesn't know what to do. The Democrats
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:57.520]  don't know what to do. So there you go. So I just was that guy and now Trump's swinging.
[3:22:57.520 --> 3:23:03.200]  Go back guys. What are you doing? Now you see Trump swinging, having a good time with the
[3:23:03.200 --> 3:23:08.720]  political lynching, showing them his karate moves. So there you go. So that's just a meme idea for
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:18.960]  you there from the Ridiculous Six. So I will consider that. I was just that guy. And if I ever
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:24.240]  want to be banned from social media, I will definitely do that. It depicts Trump being hung.
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:30.400]  That'll be promoted. You know what? They would be the type that would come after me
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:33.840]  because of that. They'd be like, oh, this is an incitement of violence against Trump.
[3:23:33.840 --> 3:23:37.200]  Just because they know it would get me in trouble. But that gives you even more reason to do it.
[3:23:38.560 --> 3:23:42.080]  I will look at it very seriously. I think you see what I just did here? I just put so much
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:46.960]  pressure on him live on air. And now it's if he doesn't take my meme, like, oh my gosh,
[3:23:46.960 --> 3:23:53.360]  does he hate me? Is he even my friend? I'm pretty sure if I don't do the meme, it means I'm not
[3:23:53.360 --> 3:23:58.480]  your friend. I think that I think that's what that means. Well, I'll be very I'm feeling the
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:02.400]  pressure. I mean, I'm just I'm sweating bullets over here. Oh my god. It'll be like a lynching
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:08.720]  if you don't do it. Yeah, I will be lynched if I don't do it. Here's the amazing thing though.
[3:24:08.720 --> 3:24:16.240]  Again, they they are the ones who are engaging in violence. They are the ones now doxing people.
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:20.320]  Of course, they all brag about how they doxed you. Everybody loves to do that now. It's like
[3:24:20.320 --> 3:24:24.400]  it's like a scout to them, right? It's like, ah, we got him. And they hold up your name
[3:24:24.400 --> 3:24:29.840]  like it's a scalp. Right. Kathy Griffin did the other day. She said she was going to come to
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:34.400]  she was going to she was going to see me in Kansas City or something. I don't know.
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:45.760]  What? Yeah, Kathy Griffin, she was she was mad about the Kingsman video. And someone said that
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:52.560]  I made it. And then they said my name. And then so she called out she called out my name and said
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:58.320]  something about seeing me in Kansas City sooner rather than later or something like that. And I
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:06.960]  was crazy. Maybe she's going there for the barbecue. I kind of doubt it. But this is the same lady who
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:13.600]  holds up who physically did a photo shoot with a decapitated Trump had who's triggered over a
[3:25:13.600 --> 3:25:20.960]  cartoon. No, she was mad. She's mad because she's actually in the video, I think. But oh, you know
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:27.920]  what? And I think it's time for us to go next level. Are you ready for this? Even more next level
[3:25:27.920 --> 3:25:33.760]  than than the last next level we just did. Yeah. Okay, I'm right. And we're actually like skipping
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:40.000]  two levels. We're going into like warp zone here. I think it's time for us live on the Alex Shone
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:48.800]  show to disavow all Looney Tunes because they depict violence against animals. They depict
[3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:56.160]  violence against animals of color. Right. And so and so I think it's time for us to disavow
[3:25:56.160 --> 3:26:02.880]  Looney Tunes disavow Warner Brothers. And this is just the beginning but but I disavow Bugs Bunny
[3:26:02.880 --> 3:26:08.800]  and Daffy Duck and Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian and Wiley Coyote and Road Runner.
[3:26:08.800 --> 3:26:14.720]  There's so much bigotry and discrimination and violence in Looney Tunes. I disavow I disavow
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:22.160]  as well. But I want to go a step further. I believe that Wiley Coyote and the Road Runner is a racist
[3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:27.120]  cartoon. It's it's obviously I mean the coyote don't even get me started on Speedy Gonzalez.
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:34.000]  I had Speedy Gonzalez. I mean, well, clearly, clearly, but but Wiley all of the violence is
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:40.880]  directed towards people of color or animals of color, whatever they may be. So yeah, I totally
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:46.400]  disavow all Warner Brothers products and all cartoons, including the ones that I've the crew
[3:26:46.400 --> 3:26:51.280]  also just pointed me. How about the bigotry with Pepe Le Pew like every French person is a is a
[3:26:51.280 --> 3:26:59.200]  serial rapist? Exactly. Unbelievable. Can you imagine the the womanization of a Pepe Le Pew?
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:09.600]  Pepe Le Pew is one of the craziest things. Are you laughing at the abuse of Pepe Le Pew?
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:15.920]  I can't. I'm thinking back to my childhood watching those cartoons.
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:20.160]  How did those cartoons even make it on the air?
[3:27:20.160 --> 3:27:29.520]  Like he scares that cat to death every single time. Like that cat is like terrified of him.
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:34.320]  No, but you're right. You these cartoons wouldn't even be allowed on television
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:38.560]  in this day and age. Right. And they're like the greatest ever. Like it's well known,
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:44.880]  like the Looney Tunes broke ground for cartoons. Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, the Bugs Bunny ones are
[3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:51.040]  usually my favorite. But just thinking back on some of them, man, times have changed just a
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:59.520]  little bit since then. I feel I feel that the depiction of Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam is racist
[3:27:59.520 --> 3:28:05.040]  against white people. What? Hold on. This is a real story. They just found it exploring the
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:11.760]  hidden racist past of Looney Tunes. I didn't even know this was out there. I'm sure that's
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:18.320]  yeah, it's that doesn't surprise me at all. Now listen, boy. Now listen, good boy.
[3:28:19.280 --> 3:28:23.200]  I'll tell the world of the boy that doesn't know how to play baseball, son.
[3:28:25.600 --> 3:28:30.960]  Gender stereotypes. It's it's a it's a killer, man. That's it. I seriously like I'll play.
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:35.200]  We should almost just play a Looney Tunes cartoon and just like break down the bigotry.
[3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:40.880]  They do a breakdown unit. I want to get your take not not to go back to South Park, but here we go
[3:28:40.880 --> 3:28:45.520]  back to South Park. I want to get your take on the first three episodes or four episodes above.
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:50.560]  It's been brilliant. Let's do that. And you know, I just want to disavow Looney Tunes too for having
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:57.840]  the first gay frog ever on air dancing about like a dandy singing show tunes. I mean, it's just
[3:28:58.400 --> 3:29:05.120]  to stereotype gay frogs like that. It's just rude. Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries,
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:09.520]  high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[3:29:09.520 --> 3:29:14.960]  but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and
[3:29:14.960 --> 3:29:19.520]  irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:24.800]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across
[3:29:24.800 --> 3:29:30.080]  America. My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling

[3:29:54.960 --> 3:30:06.240]  Heart and body extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com. Again, I'm not talking down to the info wars
[3:30:06.240 --> 3:30:11.440]  audience, but I've been banging my head against a wall for a long time on this and I'm talking
[3:30:11.440 --> 3:30:17.520]  about fluoride and I'm talking about iodine. Now, if you have a boat, a motorboat, let's say an
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:23.440]  old glass tron boat and you want to take it on the lake, you've got to have a lake to put it in.
[3:30:24.320 --> 3:30:29.520]  If you're a human being, you've got to have oxygen to live. Okay, it's the same thing. Well,
[3:30:29.520 --> 3:30:34.240]  ladies and gentlemen, the bad halogen is fluoride. That's why in every western nation,
[3:30:34.240 --> 3:30:38.240]  they put it in the water. They're going to teach us Christians lay down and die. The chai comms
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:42.480]  don't put it in the water. They'd execute you if you did that. They put iodine in the water
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:47.600]  because it's the good halogen and increases fertility and lifespan and intelligence and
[3:30:47.600 --> 3:30:52.800]  everything else. So, again, learn about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com. We have
[3:30:52.800 --> 3:30:57.200]  all the documents and articles linked and then get good iodine for yourself because the globalists
[3:30:57.200 --> 3:31:06.320]  are fighting to make sure you don't. Again, get iodine at infowarstore.com. Here are the facts.
[3:31:07.360 --> 3:31:13.840]  Iodine raises IQ and across the board makes you more healthy in thousands of top studies,
[3:31:13.840 --> 3:31:20.960]  including the American Medical Journal. Every type of fluoride lowers IQ, massively increases
[3:31:20.960 --> 3:31:27.760]  cancer and destroys fertility. That's the facts. Learn about the iodine conspiracy and then once
[3:31:27.760 --> 3:31:32.400]  you've learned about it, protect yourself and your family. The reason I'm so hot on this is the
[3:31:32.400 --> 3:31:37.280]  globalists put the fluoride in the water while making sure we don't get the iodine. In China,
[3:31:37.280 --> 3:31:41.440]  they put the iodine in the water and ban the fluoride because they've already got their people
[3:31:41.440 --> 3:31:47.520]  under their control. The globalists are targeting us here. Please go to infowarstore.com, experience
[3:31:47.520 --> 3:31:52.080]  iodine and biotrysulinium that goes with it together and then once you see the great results,
[3:31:52.080 --> 3:31:56.640]  warn others. This is the Achilles Hill of the Globalist. It's a win-win situation. The only
[3:31:56.640 --> 3:31:58.960]  way you lose is not taking action. Take action now.
[3:32:02.960 --> 3:32:09.200]  Hello today on All Things Considered. I'm Wilbur Snakily here to tell you all that there's been
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:14.880]  a lot of conspiracy theories out there that fluoride in your water is hurting you.
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:20.560]  Now, sure, the Journal of American Medical Association admits that it's causing some cancer
[3:32:20.560 --> 3:32:25.280]  and massive brain damage and infertility, but after all, isn't there too many people? That's
[3:32:25.280 --> 3:32:32.800]  right. Drink the fluoride. Don't visit infowarstore.com and get the good halogen. I mean the bad
[3:32:32.800 --> 3:32:39.200]  halogen. Iodine. Don't give it to yourself, your husband, your wife, your children. Just drink the
[3:32:39.200 --> 3:32:47.280]  fluoride and plunge into subservience to us. We don't want to compete with you. Just drink the
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:54.400]  fluoride. Don't learn about how deadly it is and whatever you do. Don't support Alex Jones.
[3:32:54.400 --> 3:33:00.640]  Remember, I'm speaking with a soft voice, so I'm a liberal. Oh, and let Namble have access to your
[3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:01.120]  children.
[3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:08.160 --> 3:33:30.400]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[3:33:30.400 --> 3:33:42.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for you to go to infowarstore.com and take advantage of the

[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:27.120]  All right, Carpe, we were just calling out the blatant bigotry of Looney Tunes cartoons.
[3:34:27.120 --> 3:34:31.840]  I mean, how dare you if you're Looney Tunes. But you had a question for me, so go ahead.
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:39.280]  My question was just what you thought of the first three or four episodes of South Park.
[3:34:39.840 --> 3:34:45.200]  They've been going after China really hard. The last one, let them eat goo. Is that the fourth
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:50.320]  or third episode? I feel like it's the fourth. I think it's the fourth. Okay, yeah, the crew.
[3:34:50.320 --> 3:34:57.440]  I got to say South Park has always been ahead of its time. But now it's like
[3:34:58.400 --> 3:35:04.480]  reach this weird crucible where it used to be there like 10 years ahead of their time. Now
[3:35:04.480 --> 3:35:09.440]  they're like 10 minutes ahead of their time. Right. And it's like they put out an episode and then
[3:35:09.440 --> 3:35:15.360]  reality follows almost immediately. We saw that with the China episodes. So to me, it's really
[3:35:15.360 --> 3:35:21.600]  just that South Park is doing what South Park has always done. It's just either they're so good
[3:35:21.600 --> 3:35:28.560]  or they're so keyed in on being ahead of their time. They've narrowed their linear scale to
[3:35:28.560 --> 3:35:36.560]  being immediate. So I think they're like they told the story of America like before it happened.
[3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:42.720]  And they're finally catching up with it now. And I love the fact they have no fear. And
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:46.720]  they're really they're kind of like the whole too big to fail notion. I mean, you can't get rid
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:52.000]  of South Park. It's way too popular. And I guess they just love they still love doing it enough
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:59.360]  to keep making new content that is just incredible. But I think the let them eat goo episode that
[3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:04.720]  this one might take a little bit longer to age. But but it's it's they nailed it. And all these
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:10.800]  people that are promoting these meatless burgers need to see that episode and maybe get a little
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:20.960]  taste of what they're actually eating. Right. Yeah, I like I I like the part where he's he says,
[3:36:21.920 --> 3:36:28.000]  this is awful. This is awful. He's like, wait for it. Wait for these. Oh, it's good.
[3:36:29.920 --> 3:36:35.040]  The Taggarty burger. Yeah, the Taggarty burger. Oh, man, they've gone. They've gone so hard against
[3:36:35.040 --> 3:36:42.160]  China. And I think it's I think it's great. They've had some shocking moments like where
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:51.760]  Stan or Randy, Randy kills Poo Bear. I mean, that was that was just over the top. I need some honey.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:37:01.040]  There's a jar of honey sitting in an alley. Right. Right. But it's like that's what I'm saying. It's
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:08.320]  like South Park called out China the minute before calling out China became a crime in the NBA.
[3:37:09.280 --> 3:37:13.840]  Right. And so it's like everything just kind of followed. And then they put out the episode
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:19.360]  banned in China. It literally gets banned in China. Right. You can't even you can't make that up.
[3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:28.160]  Yeah, it's a they've been very prophetic and and in the past. And I think this is just another one
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:34.960]  of those things. And you know, I think it's funny also that, you know, they turned they've made this
[3:37:34.960 --> 3:37:41.520]  like whole side plot of the Taggarty Farms thing going after like the, you know, the fight between
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:47.920]  like marijuana growers and like big, big, big companies that are trying to just make a buck and
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:54.400]  expanding expanding into China. I love how he goes to China and they open up his his suitcase and
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:38:06.480]  like, what is all this? He's like, it's weed. Yeah. So no one else, you know what the thing is,
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:11.360]  though, and it's almost like South Park has an obligation to stick around because no one else
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.240]  is allowed South Park is grandfathered in to making these jokes. Nobody else can make these jokes
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:19.360]  anymore on television. They wouldn't get a season. They wouldn't get a pilot.
[3:38:19.360 --> 3:38:28.160]  No, I mean, you know, I think I think that Matt Stone and Trey are they're probably at the point
[3:38:28.160 --> 3:38:31.920]  now where they're like, if we get canceled, we just get canceled. Like we've been doing this for
[3:38:31.920 --> 3:38:38.880]  like 20 years. And they don't they're not really beholden to anybody. I don't think that this is
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:43.680]  well, if you recall, they've actually reached I would say probably twice in their careers making
[3:38:43.680 --> 3:38:49.680]  South Park where they've wanted to be canceled. Right. Well, wasn't it last season that they had
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:55.360]  like hashtag cancel South South Park as like the ending frame of every episode year before it? But
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:39:03.680]  yeah. Yeah. But I mean, they've always pushed the envelope. I still remember the first first
[3:39:03.680 --> 3:39:10.240]  season or one of the first seasons, they were feeding they were feeding bacon to a pig on camera
[3:39:10.240 --> 3:39:16.960]  on their DVD extras. And just saying, Oh, you taste so good. Don't you? And it's like they're
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:20.960]  they're always just been like way out there, but hilarious at the same time. They showed up to the
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.640]  those film awards or whatever, tripping acid. And then of course, they had the entire they had
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:32.880]  they had the entire theater industry live theater industry hating them, because their their show
[3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:39.360]  Book of Mormon is the most successful musical ever on Broadway by far. Right. Right.
[3:39:39.360 --> 3:39:45.360]  Right. Well, did you ever see the their old musical they did cannibal the musical? Do you
[3:39:45.360 --> 3:39:52.480]  ever see that? No, was that before? It was a movie. It was a it was a movie. It was no I don't think
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:57.120]  it was ever performed. But it was called cannibal the musical and it's it's crazy.
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:04.960]  But watching, I just wonder where because again, South Park is like nobody else can really make
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:13.440]  jokes like they can. They're kind of grandfathered in. It's like the last relic of of 90s pop culture
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:19.840]  entertainment that that that thread of not giving a you know what and giving the middle finger to
[3:40:19.840 --> 3:40:24.880]  PC. It's like they're the last bastion of that. So now they almost have a duty to stick around.
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:29.360]  But I love the fact because really, here's what it is to me. Obviously,
[3:40:29.360 --> 3:40:34.480]  they've made plenty of money making South Park millions of dollars. They don't need money.
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:38.160]  And so they sit here and give the middle finger like, yeah, we don't care, ban us in China. We'd
[3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:42.320]  rather have American freedom and Chinese money. But then you have the NBA, these spilled rotten
[3:40:42.320 --> 3:40:47.760]  brats making 20 million a year, who still want that Chinese money. And it just it just goes to
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:53.200]  show you the difference in the philosophical approach of what being happy is and what being
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:41:00.960]  being happy is and what being American is. Well, and you know, South Park and like you said,
[3:41:00.960 --> 3:41:07.840]  there's very few shows out there like it. But South Park has done a really good job over the
[3:41:07.840 --> 3:41:14.080]  the course of its of its runtime of making fun of everybody. And they get away with they would
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:18.320]  they get away with how far they go on certain things because they are guilty of making fun
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:25.280]  of everyone equally. I mean, they'll go after Mormons, they've gone after Scientologists,
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:30.240]  they've gone after Christians, they've gone after like every every group that you can think of rich
[3:41:30.240 --> 3:41:36.960]  black Democrats, they've gone after rich white white Republicans, they've gone after rich white
[3:41:36.960 --> 3:41:42.720]  black people. I mean, they've gone all over the gambit. Yeah, they parody Trump all the time.
[3:41:42.720 --> 3:41:48.880]  And I think it's funny. Yeah, a lot of a lot of their parodies are fine. Now, contrast that with
[3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:55.280]  the way that the Simpsons went, the Simpsons have gone full social justice warrior there.
[3:41:55.920 --> 3:42:01.520]  I watched part of an episode, I think it was a couple of weeks ago. And it's,
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:07.040]  it's just one of the worst travesties. Yeah, they had the whole jihad. They had the whole jihad
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:12.240]  squad featured in an episode taking Trump out. I'm not even sure if Matt Groening is even involved
[3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:17.600]  really in that show anymore. I think it's just kind of just a Fox staple now, because Matt's
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:24.320]  writing his own show for Netflix Disenchantment, which isn't bad. But yeah, I don't know if he
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:29.040]  really has any say in the Simpsons anymore. Hey, a final 30 seconds, Carpe, take us to break,
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:34.000]  plug anything you got coming up. So I don't have anything specific coming up. I've always got
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:43.760]  a got memeworld.com site is updated, you know, daily. We've got 1516 contributors that are
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:48.720]  constantly putting new content up there. Go over to memeworld.com, check that out.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:56.400]  You can always find all of the newest stuff from me and all of my friends there. And obviously,
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:43:00.800]  you'll find terrible, terrible stuff there. So don't don't don't actually take my advice. Don't go
[3:43:00.800 --> 3:43:08.160]  there, right? Welcome back to MPR here today. I'm Wilbur Snakely. And I just want you to know that
[3:43:08.160 --> 3:43:13.520]  when you're the intro of the show, and it's the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation,
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:20.240]  don't look into the 1920s and 30s documents where they said that to be free from war, we must end
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:26.320]  the family and masculinity, and that we must put chemicals in the food and water to make the men
[3:43:26.320 --> 3:43:33.520]  subservient and the women infertile. A real terrorist, Alex Jones, has been on air with that
[3:43:33.520 --> 3:43:40.000]  gravelly evil male voice telling you to look into how iodine's good for your body and essential,
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:46.320]  and how fluoride's bad. Listen, that's a conspiracy theory, okay? There's no medical journals,
[3:43:46.320 --> 3:43:53.520]  there's no facts. You need fluoride. Just drink extra fluoride. And then you don't have to think
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:58.160]  anymore and just go to sleep when I talk to you real soft like this.
[3:44:01.040 --> 3:44:05.840]  Please listen to this information because it can save your life, and it can save the life of others.
[3:44:06.560 --> 3:44:10.640]  There couldn't be more critical information for your physical body. God's more important when it
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:15.360]  comes to your soul, but this is most important when it comes to your body. If people didn't know
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:22.800]  that you put motor oil in a car's oil container to lube the engine, they might be able to be conned
[3:44:22.800 --> 3:44:27.440]  and think you put salt water in it, but it would seize up the engine pretty much instantly. Well,
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:32.480]  if they put fluoride in the human body, it causes cancer, dumbs us down, and destroys fertility.
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:36.720]  If you put the good halogen in the body, high-quality iodine, it's like putting good,
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:41.200]  high-quality motor oil in the car that's supposed to run on it. It's that simple.
[3:44:41.200 --> 3:44:45.200]  Find out about the iodine conspiracy at infowarstore.com, and find out what the globalist
[3:44:45.200 --> 3:44:49.280]  hope that you do not research this information. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever you do,
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:54.880]  research iodine deficiency. It's the key to everything, and then go and take advantage of
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:44:59.440]  the 60% off combo with our two different types of high-quality iodine and biotrystallinium
[3:44:59.440 --> 3:45:08.880]  at infowarstore.com today. Infowars presents Alex Jones. In August of 2019, JAMA, or the Journal
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:13.600]  of the American Medical Association, the most prestigious came out and said, oh my gosh,
[3:45:13.600 --> 3:45:18.480]  just a little bit of fluoride in the water causes lowered IQs, massive infertility, and a lot of
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:23.440]  babies die in the womb, and it causes cancer. That was just one of thousands of studies admitting
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:28.000]  this. You know, it's illegal to have even one part per billion in the water in places like
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:33.600]  California unless it's part of adding fluoride, and then they have a waiver and can add thousands of
[3:45:33.600 --> 3:45:39.040]  deadly chemicals to your water because the Liberals love you, and they want to sexualize your
[3:45:39.040 --> 3:45:43.600]  children. So whatever you do, drink lots of fluoride, and don't get the thing that counters
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:50.800]  the iodine at infowarstore.com. Drink fluoride and die. Drink fluoride, dirty Americans, and
[3:45:50.800 --> 3:45:56.320]  roll over. Do not visit infowarstore.com and get high-poly iodine to counter it. No, roll over
[3:45:56.320 --> 3:46:04.720]  and die, dirty Americans. Infowars.com forward slash show. Now what I'm about to say is incredibly
[3:46:04.720 --> 3:46:08.960]  obvious, and I'm not talking down to any of the viewers or any of the listeners. I'm just taking
[3:46:08.960 --> 3:46:14.480]  the facts. I own a chainsaw. I've had it since I was in college, and it's a great good old chainsaw,
[3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:20.320]  and I've used it probably 500 times, but a few times I've forgotten to oil it, and it seizes up
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:25.760]  really quick, and I feel like an idiot for not oiling it. Now imagine if somebody told me to put
[3:46:26.400 --> 3:46:32.240]  let's say superglue in the oil container on it, it would seize up forever, but only an evil person
[3:46:32.240 --> 3:46:36.880]  would do that. Well, fluorides like putting superglue in a chainsaw, it's going to make it seize up,
[3:46:36.880 --> 3:46:40.240]  and that's why they put it in the water, and they admit they're doing it to hurt you and your
[3:46:40.240 --> 3:46:45.680]  family. Yes, they're really evil. Iodine is like putting oil in the chainsaw to help with the
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:50.560]  gasoline lubrication. It's that simple. I know you understand this, but let's warn other people
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:55.200]  before it's too late. It's part of the iodine conspiracy. Find out more at infowarstore.com
[3:46:55.200 --> 3:47:00.400]  and take action against the globalist. Carbon's everywhere on this planet. It's almost like we're
[3:47:00.400 --> 3:47:09.120]  carbon based life forms. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:41.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left in America has aligned itself with the anti-American
[3:47:42.080 --> 3:47:50.400]  communist, globalist, criminal, confab that they hate and they don't realize how they're being
[3:47:51.120 --> 3:47:58.000]  used like pawns in a game of global chess, geopolitical chess, and they have a very
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:05.440]  short-sighted vision of history and the future. And so they're openly engaging in all this right
[3:48:05.440 --> 3:48:12.720]  now, and they don't realize how they're their own worst enemy. Alex Jones breaks down how
[3:48:13.360 --> 3:48:22.800]  the leftists are being used like pawns in chess. What do socialism, communism, and globalism all
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:30.800]  have in common? They're all command and control centralized systems that have a bullet bureau
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:37.360]  or a group of bureaucrats, technocrats that run them. And if you study the top Fortune 100 companies
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:46.400]  and the big banks to a company, they finance the move towards centralization and towards
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:52.800]  world government. So when President Trump gets up there and says socialism, communism, and globalism
[3:48:53.760 --> 3:49:00.320]  are our enemies, he is singling out the true enemy of humanity, and that's why the system
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:06.560]  is so incredibly scared. The 20th century industrialized and computerized everything,
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:11.120]  and humanity really got sucker punched by these guys with all the Hollywood propaganda.
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:17.120]  But 19 years into the 21st century, humanity is coming back from the dead and really realizing
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:21.520]  what's happening and understanding how these big multinational corporations aren't liberal,
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:27.360]  they're fascistic, they're authoritarian, but they package themselves as liberal and loving.
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:33.200]  The truth is they're trying to create a planet that's post-human, where normal natural human
[3:49:33.200 --> 3:49:38.720]  activity has been basically outlawed and everything is artificiality, where you've got to get government
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:43.200]  and corporate approval, even have a child, because we've been so poisoned it's impossible to have a
[3:49:43.200 --> 3:49:49.520]  child. That's their final revolution, ending what we are as a species forever. That's what the Carnegie
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:54.000]  Endowment was tasked to do at the end of World War II, and that's their plan. And that's why
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:59.840]  they're so upset at President Trump, that's why they're so upset at Info Wars. Info Wars is credited
[3:49:59.840 --> 3:50:04.400]  by the leftist-run CIA and by the Ford Foundation and by Media Matters and by all these different
[3:50:04.400 --> 3:50:10.880]  globalist organs as launching Trump and as writing the talking points for the global resistance.
[3:50:11.440 --> 3:50:17.040]  But we really didn't do that. We simply studied the white papers of the Chai comms and the EU
[3:50:17.040 --> 3:50:22.080]  and the Council on Foreign Relations and the transhumanist movements and understood what their
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:28.400]  real sneak attack revolution against humanity was and decided to say, hey, I bet folks will want
[3:50:28.400 --> 3:50:34.720]  to hear about this, especially as it begins to actually manifest and emerge, and I bet people
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:40.720]  will resist it. And you know what? My basic understanding of reality and history turned out
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:46.880]  to be damn right. And so let the enemy to know, I didn't bring this resistance, I simply helped
[3:50:46.880 --> 3:50:52.160]  point it out, and I bet on humanity, something you haven't been doing. So if you want to stand
[3:50:52.160 --> 3:50:56.160]  with humanity and stand with Info Wars and stand with President Trump, spread the word about this
[3:50:56.160 --> 3:51:00.000]  live broadcast, spread the word about the articles, and buy some products at infowarstore.com,
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:04.160]  because without you supporting us, the enemy will win. You take action, we are going to kick
[3:51:04.160 --> 3:51:10.240]  some major globalist ass into the future and have a pro-human future. We're fighting a campaign
[3:51:10.240 --> 3:51:16.320]  against leftists, socialists, and globalists who want to return to reckless wars, open borders,
[3:51:16.320 --> 3:51:28.160]  rampant crime, and totally disastrous one-way trade deals. They believe America is the world's
[3:51:28.160 --> 3:51:34.720]  piggy bank and that your tax dollars should subsidize the economy, military, and defense
[3:51:34.720 --> 3:51:39.120]  of every other nation in the world but our own. It's not happening anymore.
[3:51:39.120 --> 3:51:47.200]  Our political opposition made its fortune selling out our nation and its citizens,
[3:51:47.200 --> 3:51:54.480]  and you know that's what's been happening, and that's why 2016 was so important, and that's why
[3:51:55.360 --> 3:52:02.160]  2020, I can never say it's more important, but you know it's like the roots of a tree,
[3:52:02.160 --> 3:52:09.200]  you plant the baby tree, it's got to catch. Get that extra time, we'll have more tax cuts, we'll
[3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:17.120]  have even, I'll tell you what, we have rebuilt our military. What we've done has never been done before.
[3:52:19.680 --> 3:52:25.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, last five minutes of the Alex Jones show here at infowars.com
[3:52:25.920 --> 3:52:33.280]  slash show and band.video, and where do we really go from here? What do I want to use this final
[3:52:33.280 --> 3:52:39.840]  five minutes for until I take over the war room from three to four p.m. central and then Harrison
[3:52:39.840 --> 3:52:44.080]  finishes it off for me till six p.m. normally where I'm at, but you know,
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:52.800]  ever since coming on board here at infowars and being a part of it, what we see is
[3:52:52.800 --> 3:52:58.800]  we are tomorrow's news today, sometimes next month's news today, sometimes next year's news today,
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:07.680]  sometimes next decade's news today. And so when you see stories like Obama going to a Soros fundraiser,
[3:53:07.680 --> 3:53:14.240]  you're not surprised because we told you Obama was working with Soros. When you see stories about
[3:53:15.200 --> 3:53:20.960]  a website being launched called Racist Watch that literally maps out and names
[3:53:20.960 --> 3:53:27.520]  with addresses, names of individuals who donated to Trump's campaign in 2016, which is of course
[3:53:28.080 --> 3:53:34.720]  an intimidation factor to try to stop you from donating again, which ultimately probably won't
[3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:39.040]  matter. It's just this is the left engaged in domestic terror and now openly and publicly
[3:53:39.040 --> 3:53:47.520]  doxing people. Well, you're not surprised. We told you that as well. And it's a weird habit.
[3:53:47.520 --> 3:53:54.720]  It's not even a habit. It's just we're focused. Like if you're an athlete
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:54:04.480]  in competition, you don't dwell on the play from four plays ago or from two series ago or the shot
[3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:11.120]  from last quarter or the last hole or whatever sport you're playing. You have to move on.
[3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:15.760]  You're in a competition. You're in a battle. You have to win. You can't dwell on the past.
[3:54:15.760 --> 3:54:21.440]  You have to move forward and continue for victory. But I'm trying to make it a habit
[3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:25.360]  because we pick up new audience members every day that don't get to see all the
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:29.680]  Info Wars content. They don't see all the content that was erased off YouTube proving
[3:54:29.680 --> 3:54:34.240]  how right we were about all this stuff. So I went into the archives today. I had to go back
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:41.840]  months to find it, but we and I explained it in the clip. I'm going to air it on the
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:49.120]  war room coming up here at 3 p.m. But there's a reason why a lot of times when Alex comes on air
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:57.360]  and has Intel and he goes with it. It sounds crazy at the time and you don't see till months later
[3:54:58.560 --> 3:55:04.400]  how accurate it actually was. And we have to do a lot of that around here. And there's a reason
[3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:13.520]  why other people don't do it. They're afraid for multiple reasons and they want to fit in to the
[3:55:13.520 --> 3:55:22.320]  DC and really by extension New York establishment that doesn't like the way we do things here
[3:55:22.320 --> 3:55:31.360]  at Info Wars. But we are just a representation, a manifestation of the Republic screaming,
[3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:38.720]  fighting all the corruption that has now come full circle and we're seeing it
[3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:49.360]  aimed at Donald Trump. So we see they complain about lynching. They literally depict Trump
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:54.560]  being lynched at leftist protests. They literally put up whole nooses and everything and the
[3:55:54.560 --> 3:56:03.280]  guillotines or whatever to pretend here we are killing Trump in our weird ritual. But then
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:08.240]  Trump says a political lynching is happening to him which is 100% accurate and all of a sudden he's
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:12.720]  the worst guy in the world. How dare he say lynching. So Trump has to walk on a tightrope
[3:56:14.720 --> 3:56:20.800]  but everyone else on the left they can just run around on a big wide open field and do whatever
[3:56:20.800 --> 3:56:27.360]  the hell they want. Depict lynching Trump, depict chopping Trump's head off, CNN literally writes
[3:56:27.360 --> 3:56:33.760]  a thing about Hillary Clinton being lynched politically and that's okay but if Trump does it
[3:56:34.800 --> 3:56:36.560]  well it's the end of the world isn't it?
[3:56:40.240 --> 3:56:47.120]  So this is just what you get from the left. It's really amazing what the left has become.
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:53.520]  Honestly it's mind-boggling. What they embrace, what they endorse, what they promote and just
[3:56:54.080 --> 3:57:05.920]  what they do on the streets. It's sick. It is sick. So we just cover it, give you the inside
[3:57:05.920 --> 3:57:10.800]  information. That's why they hate us. That's why they ban us ladies and gentlemen. So infowarstore.com
