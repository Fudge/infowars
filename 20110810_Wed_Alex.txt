[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:39.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.360 --> 00:45.920]  we are live ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the 10th day of August 2011
[00:45.920 --> 00:52.320]  and we have laid out for the last decade that when the financial collapse began
[00:52.320 --> 01:00.600]  by design due to derivatives that the welfare class would begin to riot even
[01:00.600 --> 01:05.680]  if they needed to be basically directed to riot as a pretext to menace what's
[01:05.680 --> 01:11.040]  left for the middle class to accept a high-tech police state the rollout of TSA
[01:11.040 --> 01:18.680]  style domestic checkpoints and that then the so-called left would call for even
[01:18.680 --> 01:24.560]  more goodies to the quote disadvantaged underclass and hold the public hostage
[01:24.560 --> 01:28.800]  now what's really happening is the mega rich that get most of their wealth or
[01:28.800 --> 01:34.480]  government welfare corporate welfare in one way or another they smoke screen all
[01:34.480 --> 01:39.000]  of their activities by always focusing on the poor that are getting welfare while
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.080]  at the same time they push to give the poor more welfare creating these spoiled
[01:44.080 --> 01:53.560]  rotten dependency laden dysfunctional crime-ridden cultures and it's the same
[01:53.560 --> 01:57.800]  all over the world and it is predominantly the welfare class that
[01:57.800 --> 02:02.560]  then is able to get the cheap seats at soccer football basketball games and
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.360]  who go and riot and burn down parts of cities and beat people to death whenever
[02:08.360 --> 02:15.440]  their team wins or loses this is the culture of gangster hooliganism and
[02:15.440 --> 02:20.080]  that's what you're seeing in England some people are lauding this as a
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.080]  wondrous beautiful revolution revolution would be against Goldman Sachs JP
[02:26.080 --> 02:33.760]  Morgan Bank of America the revolution would be against the Queen of England
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.440]  it would be against David Cameron would be against the Parliament and then you
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.680]  have to judge is it a good revolution or a bad revolution that comes from your
[02:41.680 --> 02:48.720]  perspective and what you stand for but carjacking people burning down family
[02:48.720 --> 02:53.920]  businesses burning down homes and running over people that try to protect
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.920]  their businesses and killing them as happened as last night running over and
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.720]  killing South Asian immigrants to England trying to guard their businesses
[03:04.720 --> 03:11.400]  that is not revolution now the George Soros Al Gore types who've been calling
[03:11.400 --> 03:17.640]  for Arab Springs Al Gore here in the United States in Europe they will praise
[03:17.640 --> 03:23.440]  it and they will call it a revolution because it's exactly what they want
[03:23.440 --> 03:29.040]  so that the apparatus of the state can come in as the arbiter and as the
[03:29.040 --> 03:33.720]  referee and that is what is really going on here at the end of the day we're
[03:33.720 --> 03:38.800]  gonna be breaking it all down we have Patrick Henningson who was a witness and
[03:38.800 --> 03:42.760]  had to barricade himself in for the safety in South London he'll be joining

[03:52.880 --> 04:01.320]  revolution against tyranny and so we'll be enlightened by Max coming up at the
[04:01.320 --> 04:09.720]  bottom of the next hour now when we come back I'm gonna discuss the fact that I
[04:09.720 --> 04:14.360]  guess this is revolution to San Francisco Giants fans on Craig list
[04:14.360 --> 04:21.600]  declared today beat a Dodger day encourage a murder of a Dodgers fan
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.520]  Twitter's refusing to take down people's accounts that call for violence and
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.520]  torching well Twitter was admittedly set up by the CIA and through the State
[04:30.520 --> 04:34.040]  Department has been running destabilization campaigns and so of
[04:34.040 --> 04:38.880]  course they would do such a thing now if we called for murder on our platform
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.320]  we'd be shut down in hours better believe it but when they do it's a okay
[04:43.320 --> 04:49.720]  Boston Bruins wins Stanley Cup vancouver fans riot yes that's revolution

[08:08.440 --> 08:26.640]  we are live thank you for joining us it is Wednesday the 10th day of August
[08:26.640 --> 08:35.840]  2011 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours well these are the
[08:35.840 --> 08:46.760]  times that try men and women souls great period of unrest and upheaval is now
[08:46.760 --> 08:52.520]  upon us as a society as a world we have been in the throes of a depression
[08:52.520 --> 08:58.680]  globally for at least three years it is now intensifying and is only going to
[08:58.680 --> 09:06.160]  get worse from here on out unless we remove the corrupt ruling class that
[09:06.160 --> 09:11.160]  have seized control of the world economy through fraud namely through
[09:11.160 --> 09:16.360]  fractional reserve banking and then the last 12 years through derivatives which
[09:16.360 --> 09:23.800]  allow them to create unlimited counterfeit financial instruments now it
[09:23.800 --> 09:30.520]  has always been the ruling classes establish rule to control large cities
[09:30.520 --> 09:34.840]  going back thousands of years by having large different segments of the
[09:34.840 --> 09:41.760]  population living in welfare slums that are funded by the government the
[09:41.760 --> 09:46.480]  Romans did this more than 2,000 years ago they had a bread and also a silver
[09:46.480 --> 09:53.760]  allotment and anytime that the surrounding a rural gentry did not pay the
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.360]  high taxes or do what they were told the welfare crowds would be released the
[09:58.360 --> 10:04.080]  Roman military would stand down and the welfare hordes would exit the city and
[10:04.080 --> 10:10.240]  begin robbing and looting and stealing and burning you could then not count on
[10:10.240 --> 10:16.440]  the Roman fire department to give you any assistance also in the city in
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.880]  your burning neighborhood if you've not paid them large amounts of protection
[10:21.880 --> 10:26.840]  money now it was not the American Italian La Cosa Nostra that invented the
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.720]  threats of burning down your family clothier or grocery store or furniture
[10:31.720 --> 10:37.480]  store if you did not pay them protection money it was their Roman ancestors and
[10:37.480 --> 10:43.000]  that's where Julius Caesar's family made most of their money and got into
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.840]  political power was running the fire department racket our fire departments
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.060]  today are not engaged in such activities just to be clear before the New York
[10:55.060 --> 10:58.680]  Times or someone else says that I'm stating that modern fire departments
[10:58.680 --> 11:04.240]  don't talking about what is Italy today and of course formerly the Empire a
[11:04.240 --> 11:12.640]  Roman Empire based in the city of Rome okay before I get into the global
[11:12.640 --> 11:18.560]  financial meltdown before I get into the day four of uncontrolled riots the
[11:18.560 --> 11:22.960]  British Prime Minister says they might use water cannons and batons later if
[11:22.960 --> 11:29.320]  the rioters don't behave themselves this is just like in Seattle in 1999 when
[11:29.320 --> 11:32.040]  the police even admitted they were ordered to stand down and let rioters
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.320]  burn the things destroy things for a day before they then attack the peaceful
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.520]  demonstrators and set the precedent nationwide to no longer even allow
[11:41.520 --> 11:48.760]  peaceful demonstrations and to have Darth Vader festooned garbed police attack
[11:48.760 --> 11:53.720]  the general general population of peaceful protesters and that's all this
[11:53.720 --> 11:59.600]  is here what we suspected is now coming out even the BBC is admitting that police
[11:59.600 --> 12:03.680]  were ordered four nights ago to stand down in South London where all of this
[12:03.680 --> 12:12.320]  began we now have the reports that the rioters all over the country all over
[12:12.320 --> 12:20.440]  what is England within the UK that region are being directed and promised
[12:20.440 --> 12:26.840]  payments if they will riot by men claiming to be part of the media
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.960]  probably police operative provocateurs we've also seen this go on in Greece as
[12:32.960 --> 12:37.680]  well going back two years ago though their national news documented it was
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.320]  police rioting and starting the riots and then we also documented that what
[12:43.320 --> 12:47.600]  three years ago national news had to admit it later in Canada that the royal
[12:47.600 --> 12:50.920]  amount of police did dress up like anarchist and begin breaking and
[12:50.920 --> 12:54.720]  smashing and stealing so they could then have the police attack the peaceful
[12:54.720 --> 13:00.560]  crowds protesting the North American Union meeting so what they've done is
[13:00.560 --> 13:06.920]  they've primed the pump they have provocateur the first events and then
[13:06.920 --> 13:14.720]  the larger hooligan mass rushes in to expand the crisis and then David
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.960]  Cameron's not in trouble for the news core hacking gate anymore and the
[13:18.960 --> 13:24.840]  mysterious deaths David Cameron can move forward now with tax increases to
[13:24.840 --> 13:32.600]  satiate the welfare zombie mobs this is a standard operating procedure and I'm
[13:32.600 --> 13:39.160]  gonna be going over it but but but as for the individuals that are doing this
[13:39.160 --> 13:49.480]  as for the general mobs some of it at the beginning was racially motivated and I
[13:49.480 --> 13:54.000]  guess you could say in a way that's political but from the hundreds of
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.320]  emails and comments I've gotten from reporters that live in the area that
[13:57.320 --> 14:03.080]  we've talked to on air from Steve Watson who lives in London from Paul Watson
[14:03.080 --> 14:11.360]  north of London this is purely purely in the second third and fourth day groups
[14:11.360 --> 14:16.760]  of hooligans the folks like to go get drunk and get in fights at soccer games
[14:16.760 --> 14:23.360]  as part of their tribalism outlet black white you name it who were engaging in
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.840]  pure looting in fact I saw one report of an entire business district shop
[14:27.840 --> 14:33.200]  district burned leveled and looted except for a bookstore the looters had no
[14:33.200 --> 14:40.560]  interest in that electronic stores liquor stores pawn shops furniture stores
[14:40.560 --> 14:47.040]  anything of value looted and stolen and then you have the so-called left saying
[14:47.040 --> 14:53.200]  this is the beginning of the Stalinistic uprising against the bourgeoisie and in
[14:53.200 --> 15:00.080]  the ruling class absolutely ridiculous you have the rise of hooliganism in
[15:00.080 --> 15:05.760]  South Africa you have the rise of it in Brazil you have the rise of it in
[15:05.760 --> 15:11.720]  Los Angeles in New York in Chicago you do not have the rise of it in Dallas
[15:11.720 --> 15:15.440]  because if you try to pull people out of their cars in Dallas and it's happened
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.200]  a few times in these hooligan riots you were shot dead let me tell you something
[15:20.200 --> 15:24.960]  a police officer has citizens arrest power that's why citizens have citizen
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.480]  arrest power counties and cities get together and then elect a sheriff or
[15:29.480 --> 15:34.520]  elect a mayor who creates a police force of men and women that have citizens
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.120]  arrest power you try to pull me out of my car and beat me up or kill me or rape
[15:39.120 --> 15:45.840]  my wife I'm going to kill you and that is under common law thousands of years
[15:45.840 --> 15:53.000]  old and so you notice you don't have these type of things going on in Dallas
[15:53.000 --> 15:58.360]  Texas you don't have this type of stuff going on in Phoenix Arizona you don't
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.320]  have this type of stuff going on because when you start burning buildings down
[16:02.320 --> 16:08.680]  that is an act of arson in action you are committing acts that could and
[16:08.680 --> 16:13.000]  probably will kill people and if I catch people trying to burn my house or
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.840]  neighbor's house I'm gonna put a bead on you and I'm gonna unload into you and
[16:17.840 --> 16:24.000]  your cohorts understand that the globalist want law and order to break
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.600]  down so they can come in after the looting rages for weeks or even months
[16:28.600 --> 16:32.600]  as has been done in many other countries as part of the IMF World Bank plan that
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.160]  was leaked in 2002 we've covered so much they called the IMF riot and after its
[16:37.160 --> 16:44.600]  run its course the country's confidence is destroyed the stocks are destroyed the
[16:44.600 --> 16:48.360]  nation is in trouble and the big offshore banks come in and take even more
[16:48.360 --> 16:57.240]  control even more control and so where do you see these riots taking place you
[16:57.240 --> 17:02.480]  see them taking place in social engineering multicultural globalist
[17:02.480 --> 17:09.440]  run warrens of modern nitty states the first thing a nitty state does in the
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.800]  US they can't do it nationwide so they've done it city by city New York
[17:13.800 --> 17:21.120]  Chicago LA Boston to a certain extent the first thing they do in a disarmed
[17:21.120 --> 17:26.840]  nitty state is disarm the public once that happens they double or triple the
[17:26.840 --> 17:30.040]  police force you go to New York there's cops every 10 feet they're not there to
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.680]  help you they look like something out of a movie of a cartoon style police state
[17:34.680 --> 17:40.040]  third world thug they're shaking people down they're engaging in crimes they
[17:40.040 --> 17:44.120]  leave the basic criminals alone but if they see mainline productive citizens
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.320]  they set upon you and feed on you so first they disarm you then they double
[17:50.320 --> 17:54.840]  or triple the police then they come in with massive taxes and destroy the
[17:54.840 --> 17:59.680]  middle class and invite welfare pimps in from all over the country as mayor
[17:59.680 --> 18:06.120]  Bloomberg does once they've got that in place any time the public doesn't do
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.640]  exactly what the ruling class wants they just turn the welfare mobs loose they
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.080]  can rape they can steal they can do whatever they want and if it just so
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.360]  happens to be a quote minority who's really the majority in this country now
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.800]  in almost every area if they happen to assault the devil whitey who's been
[18:22.800 --> 18:27.520]  singled out as the devil and his open season if you fight back you are charged
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.280]  with hate crimes and then no one debates the fact that you were defending
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.200]  yourself you were hauled up before a special Soviet court a special commissar
[18:36.200 --> 18:41.760]  court and you were sent to prison this is going to be the model of class war
[18:41.760 --> 18:46.560]  race war government directed now as things continue to collapse as the rural
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.240]  communities collapse they're going to bring in the Homeland Security Defense
[18:50.240 --> 18:55.960]  Department run rural councils with your own little Soviet commissars over you
[18:55.960 --> 19:01.160]  cattle tail squads TSA checkpoints on the highways home inspections of law
[19:01.160 --> 19:07.800]  abiding citizens all the criminals are allowed to rule rule and dominate I see
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.680]  what looks like recent model trucks every day when I drive to work of people
[19:13.680 --> 19:22.840]  trying to trying to build roads and haul all aggregates and deliver things and I
[19:22.840 --> 19:26.680]  see the truck police pulling them over and harassing them and going over every
[19:26.680 --> 19:30.480]  inch of their truck but I can drive five miles from here and by crack cocaine

[23:58.760 --> 24:22.480]  ladies and gentlemen the globalist know that as the economy is imploded by
[24:22.480 --> 24:30.080]  design as world currencies are devalued but the first groups that are going to
[24:30.080 --> 24:35.360]  get really upset and angry are the welfare classes you'll still get your
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.360]  welfare check you'll still get your Lone Star card or in other states they
[24:40.360 --> 24:46.920]  have different names your digital food stamp card but the allotment you get
[24:46.920 --> 24:52.680]  will not purchase what it did in the past and so when these groups start
[24:52.680 --> 24:58.920]  going out rioting and looting because they've got to have the bling in this
[24:58.920 --> 25:05.480]  Madison Avenue society their rioting is going to be used to take everyone's
[25:05.480 --> 25:13.640]  liberties and I've said that over and over again in the years leading up to
[25:13.640 --> 25:21.240]  this and I guess a lot of people haven't listened to me because even if it's
[25:21.240 --> 25:27.280]  staged even if it's socially engineered still if a group of marauding looters is
[25:27.280 --> 25:30.840]  coming your way and you live in England and you don't have a right to defend
[25:30.840 --> 25:36.320]  yourself you're going to beg for the army to come in and shoot the looters who
[25:36.320 --> 25:47.400]  are also burning down people's homes and dragging folks out of their cars and the
[25:47.400 --> 25:56.320]  liberal trendy out there has had their their capacity for self-preservation
[25:56.320 --> 26:09.000]  removed from them they have had their capacity to think rationally removed I
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.440]  mean the Brits have allowed themselves to have their firearms taken to the point
[26:13.440 --> 26:19.840]  of yesterday the best-selling items on Amazon UK or aluminum baseball bats as
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.280]  people desperately I mean you lived in the UK where you can't have a firearm
[26:24.280 --> 26:28.400]  to defend yourself and you didn't already have a sword you didn't already have a
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.720]  ball-peen hammer you didn't already have a baseball bat
[26:36.960 --> 26:43.520]  what's wrong with you and then now as we go to the fourth day David Cameron has
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.000]  held back force they won't even use water cannons or rubber bullets for four
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.440]  days and now the crime has exploded the burning has exploded and there are
[26:56.440 --> 27:05.920]  members of the British Parliament now calling to shoot looters on site and I
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.480]  have to say that if you see someone looting your business here in the
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.240]  United States it is your right to shoot and kill them and for some that have
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.680]  been domesticated that is a shocking statement if you don't have that
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.800]  attitude you live in a domesticated prostrate position and I can't believe
[27:24.800 --> 27:32.160]  so many men have been gelded to the point they don't understand that if someone
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.320]  is running around in the city this is confirmed lighting fires to family
[27:37.320 --> 27:42.120]  dwellings that is attempted murder
[27:42.120 --> 27:49.640]  women and children have had to jump from burning buildings to firefighters who
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.560]  themselves are being attacked by the looters and some are calling in extreme
[27:54.560 --> 28:00.840]  to call to arm the fire departments arm the police arm the fire departments arm
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.840]  the citizens and that's how they first got gun control in England they said
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.040]  we're not even let cops have guns and then of course citizens shouldn't be
[28:08.040 --> 28:14.880]  able to and then wallah they then arm the police yes ladies and gentlemen it is
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.840]  not knee jerk reaction to call for shooting people that are setting fires
[28:20.840 --> 28:28.960]  to buildings and people ask me they say how can you have an article like knee
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.840]  jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters on site because there
[28:34.840 --> 28:39.560]  isn't prior constraint on my writers there isn't prior constraint there's no
[28:39.560 --> 28:43.320]  prior constraint on me I have people that I know of research understand
[28:43.320 --> 28:49.000]  geopolitical situations but then you get a cultural divide though with somebody
[28:49.000 --> 28:52.720]  who's a degree political scientist like Steve Watson born and bred in England
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.840]  who thinks it's shocking to see a member of parliament say this is into day four
[28:57.840 --> 29:03.200]  they're burning people's houses down shoot them folks if the police started
[29:03.200 --> 29:08.240]  shooting people day one this would have ended overnight but it shouldn't be the
[29:08.240 --> 29:15.440]  police shooting them in a free society you come to my house and try to set fire
[29:15.440 --> 29:21.040]  to it or I see you throwing mall off cocktails at my neighbor's house I am
[29:21.040 --> 29:29.800]  gonna kneel down put the side on you and squeeze the trigger but see people
[29:29.800 --> 29:34.240]  don't do this type of stuff in Texas they don't do this type of stuff in
[29:34.240 --> 29:38.640]  Oklahoma they don't do this type of stuff in Vermont or New Hampshire or
[29:38.640 --> 29:45.880]  Alabama because you come and try to burn somebody's house down you die
[29:45.880 --> 29:49.160]  we'll be right back

[34:31.200 --> 34:37.800]  a murder of a Dodgers fan that's a quote and twitter is saying that they're
[34:37.800 --> 34:43.160]  going to continue to leave the accounts up of people who are calling for
[34:43.160 --> 34:47.960]  violence burning and looting on twitter well of course twitter was used to
[34:47.960 --> 34:56.520]  overthrow the old dictator the dictator hazing mubarak it was used to then help
[34:56.520 --> 35:00.720]  put in the muslim brotherhood and oppress people even more because that's
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.520]  what the cia and mi6 wanted and now twitter is being used over in england
[35:06.520 --> 35:09.720]  according to looting and robbing and burning because the government's going
[35:09.720 --> 35:15.360]  to use it to ram through curfews and martial law rules and to shoot people on
[35:15.360 --> 35:22.440]  site for politically protesting you see this is a more drawn-out version of
[35:22.440 --> 35:29.840]  what happened in 1999 when for 24 hours the hired warehouse anarchists were
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.760]  flown in by major foundations I have it all on video in police state to the
[35:34.760 --> 35:39.040]  takeover the police on tape admitting they were ordered to stand down and let
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.640]  the looters attack and burn in Seattle so the news could say why don't they do
[35:43.640 --> 35:47.920]  something why don't they stand up against them so then the looters could
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.280]  pull back move in to a government building right next to the police
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.840]  department under police guard flown in and so the police could then attack old
[35:58.840 --> 36:06.760]  ladies who were part of the protest against the world trade organization now
[36:06.760 --> 36:12.080]  that's all that's happening here that's all that's happening here is the police
[36:12.080 --> 36:18.560]  stood down Sunday they stood down Monday they stood down Tuesday and now
[36:18.560 --> 36:24.920]  David Cameron that carbon tax promoting New World Order slime bag is saying that
[36:24.920 --> 36:33.360]  we might use water cannons on a 24-hour notice they it's ridiculous they know
[36:33.360 --> 36:39.320]  who these people are they could have three days ago off of positive IDs of
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.720]  thousands of these people arrested them put them on the news made an example of
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.600]  them but instead they're gonna let it get out of control out of control out of
[36:47.600 --> 36:53.560]  control until finally the police start shooting people with real bullets and
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.320]  then the precedent's gonna be set not to shoot somebody trying to burn your
[36:58.320 --> 37:10.440]  house down not to shoot somebody trying to burn at your house down no but
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.560]  shooting someone who goes and protest at the parliament you know you know for
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.120]  several years you haven't been allowed to protest anywhere around parliament I
[37:19.120 --> 37:23.320]  went there to peacefully speak on a bullhorn and even though it was a week
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.080]  before the law went into place they told me a lever I'd be arrested that's in
[37:27.080 --> 37:32.960]  terror storm one of my films if you tried to go down and burn areas of
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.440]  parliament you would have been shot Sunday Monday Tuesday or Wednesday but
[37:38.440 --> 37:43.760]  because the hooligans that's all this is is a branch of the soccer hooligans
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.640]  because they're burning down five generation clothiers and four generation
[37:50.640 --> 37:55.400]  watch shops and four generation furniture shops because they're dragging
[37:55.400 --> 38:00.720]  people out of their cars at at at barricades and beating them up because
[38:00.720 --> 38:05.480]  that's happening the police are standing down to let this get out of hand so the
[38:05.480 --> 38:08.760]  giant police state the British government has set up the UK government has
[38:08.760 --> 38:16.800]  set up can be dropped down like a hammer vise on the public of England and so I
[38:16.800 --> 38:21.240]  agree with Steve Watson from one angle if you're just looking at this in a
[38:21.240 --> 38:27.960]  two-dimensional way knee jerk calls for army on London streets to shoot looters
[38:27.960 --> 38:34.200]  on site well that would mean somebody out after dark wouldn't it but then it
[38:34.200 --> 38:38.640]  goes on he the member of parliament said time to get tough bring in the army
[38:38.640 --> 38:45.120]  shoot looters and arsonist on site arsonist should be shot on site and
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.680]  people attacking fire department people already risking their lives battling
[38:49.680 --> 38:55.080]  fires with women jumping out of it they should be shot that's attempted murder
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.720]  setting fires to people's houses and business is an act that could kill a
[38:59.720 --> 39:04.320]  lot of people if I ran up to you with a burning torch and said I'm gonna set you
[39:04.320 --> 39:09.400]  on fire would you have a right to defend yourself absolutely but see this is the
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.560]  psychological manipulation to where now they're gonna hold back not do what
[39:14.560 --> 39:18.280]  they're supposed to do did you tell me we had him because I didn't hear you okay
[39:18.280 --> 39:27.560]  good thank you great because I didn't hear anything over the mic what's going
[39:27.560 --> 39:33.360]  on here is is is very simple at one level but also very sophisticated it's
[39:33.360 --> 39:38.440]  problem reaction solution and you've got generation after generation of people
[39:38.440 --> 39:41.960]  dependent on welfare you've got globalism you've got deindustrialization
[39:41.960 --> 39:46.640]  you've got people living on subsistence level handouts you've got a middle class
[39:46.640 --> 39:50.480]  scared of the giant swelling underclass and you've got the social
[39:50.480 --> 39:54.880]  engineers who've all got their mountain retreats outside of England outside of
[39:54.880 --> 40:00.000]  Europe outside of the US sitting back and manipulating the whole thing and I
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.680]  predicted it all with precision I told you a year ago six months ago over and
[40:04.680 --> 40:09.160]  over again find the clips where I said society's gonna degenerate the
[40:09.160 --> 40:13.040]  austerity is going to come in the welfare hordes are going to riot an
[40:13.040 --> 40:18.640]  expanded version of a sports riot the middle class is going to get scared the
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.440]  globalists are going to stand back let the riots run their course and then
[40:23.440 --> 40:30.800]  later when the public is begging for total tyranny come in and beg for it
[40:30.800 --> 40:35.320]  come in and beg for the end of Magna Carta the end of the Bill of Rights the
[40:35.320 --> 40:40.640]  end of the Constitution and that's what has to be articulated out to everyone
[40:40.640 --> 40:45.960]  now joining us is Steve Watson who does a great job writing at info wars.com
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.560]  and prisonplanet.com but I tell you Steve it's a good article you wrote but
[40:50.560 --> 40:55.120]  if people just go with the headline knee-jerk calls for army on London
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.840]  streets to shoot looters on site if the police would have just done their job
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.480]  and apprehended these arsonist and people day one instead of letting them
[41:03.480 --> 41:08.040]  do it it wouldn't have to later come to that point but but but what do you do if
[41:08.040 --> 41:11.520]  somebody comes to your house and tries to set it on fire Steve?
[41:11.520 --> 41:17.280]  Well you do what you can obviously but I mean this is a big story we've got today
[41:17.280 --> 41:22.320]  the police were ordered to stand back which is what we were saying yesterday
[41:22.320 --> 41:27.720]  we were debating whether you know the senior police had issued orders for them
[41:27.720 --> 41:32.800]  to hold back and indeed there's articles out today that have confirmed that so
[41:32.800 --> 41:39.160]  you know you've got the police standing by while these looters run riot and then
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.600]  also today we've got videos of because the police have been ordered to come back
[41:44.600 --> 41:48.880]  and do nothing we've got videos of these sort of vigilante groups bringing up
[41:48.880 --> 41:55.040]  now which are a very very complex thing because they're made up not only of
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.320]  people that genuinely do want to protect their community and they're
[42:00.320 --> 42:05.160]  rightly so and their families and stuff like that in the absence of the police
[42:05.160 --> 42:11.520]  doing so but you know these these groups are also made up of a different kind of
[42:11.520 --> 42:17.560]  a sort of a different kind of job mentality and it's this sort of division
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.640]  between these communities that is what we've been talking about so long that
[42:21.640 --> 42:24.320]  we've seen come into fruition now.
[42:24.320 --> 42:29.880]  Absolutely a society breaks into gangs and the article is at prisonplanet.com
[42:29.880 --> 42:34.760]  and infowars.com this is big news when you get this out to everybody but we
[42:34.760 --> 42:37.800]  also need to point out that the police many times if they can't get welfare
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.000]  folks to riot they'll go out and do it themselves dressed as anarchists but
[42:42.000 --> 42:47.240]  also my film police state to the takeover details how this was done in the
[42:47.240 --> 42:53.280]  United States but here it is police were ordered to stand down as London burned
[42:53.280 --> 42:59.080]  inadequate response led to call for martial law so I see the angle that it's
[42:59.080 --> 43:04.720]  knee jerk to call for shooting people but if you had the citizenry being armed
[43:04.720 --> 43:10.360]  as is an ancient right of any free man if someone came to your home to burn it
[43:10.360 --> 43:15.760]  down which is happening in massive levels then you would have a right to
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.920]  shoot and kill the person trying to set your fire your house on fire so we see
[43:20.920 --> 43:26.520]  this unnatural abhorrent social engineering system working perfectly
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.720]  where you've got disarmed populations barricaded in their homes with them being
[43:31.720 --> 43:37.400]  set alight and the police standing down until the public begs for absolute
[43:37.400 --> 43:41.120]  iron fist to protect them not knowing that will set the precedent for the
[43:41.120 --> 43:46.040]  iron fist to be used against them in the future exactly and we've got the other
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.240]  thing we've got out today is a youth this is in the article I've written a
[43:51.240 --> 43:58.360]  Ugov poll which is Ugov is the biggest sort of pollster in this country this
[43:58.360 --> 44:03.120]  poll was conducted for the tabloids the Sun which is obviously not the most
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.560]  credible newspaper but the point is it's Ugov it's not the Sun that's saying this
[44:07.560 --> 44:13.080]  and they've done a poll amongst the population of Britain which confirms that
[44:13.080 --> 44:18.200]  you know people are demanding this sort of crackdown this police state we've got
[44:18.200 --> 44:23.920]  in this poll 90% of the British public want immediate water cannons on the
[44:23.920 --> 44:33.320]  street shooting people with high velocity water jets 78% want tear gas 72%
[44:33.320 --> 44:39.480]  want police to start tasering people in this community 84% want mounted police
[44:39.480 --> 44:48.800]  on horses 65% want plastic bullets 82% want curfews 77% of the
[44:48.800 --> 44:56.760]  population want the army on the street and a third one in three people want the
[44:56.760 --> 45:02.000]  army or the police to start using live ammunition indiscriminately it's a sort
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.320]  of the instant justice against these rioters so this is what I'm talking about
[45:06.320 --> 45:13.280]  in this article is kind of knee jerk reaction to this what essentially is
[45:13.280 --> 45:17.480]  the most cases not obviously not in the cases of the buildings that have been
[45:17.480 --> 45:22.120]  burned and everything but in most cases it is just kids burning bins in the
[45:22.120 --> 45:29.720]  streets it's just that is a complete overreaction to it and it's sort of is
[45:29.720 --> 45:35.440]  it gives you an idea of how dangerous and close we are to sort of having these
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.200]  things implanted because we've got MPs and MPs also calling for the army on the
[45:40.200 --> 45:45.880]  street so if you've got you know a large portion of the population calling for it
[45:45.880 --> 45:53.280]  and then being backed up by MPs on the news and I think things are getting a
[45:53.280 --> 45:56.520]  little bit dangerously close here well yeah it is getting dangerous because
[45:56.520 --> 46:01.360]  people's houses are getting burned down so so in the in the larger spectrum we
[46:01.360 --> 46:04.720]  know at stage the police stood down they won't get in trouble they'll get
[46:04.720 --> 46:10.000]  medals for this then the public gets scared and people like member of
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.320]  parliament Roger Helmer comes out and says quote time to get tough bring in
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.800]  the army shoot looters and arsonist on site then when he got attacked for that
[46:19.800 --> 46:24.080]  he said let's try water cannon plastic rounds first but if the police lose
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.520]  control completely tougher measures are called for well let me ask you this
[46:27.520 --> 46:32.160]  question Steve because the police have stood down obviously so the president
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.120]  will be set for martial law what are citizens supposed to do as as these
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.800]  hooligans come around robbing stealing raping burning I mean we had three
[46:41.800 --> 46:47.400]  vigilantes trying to protect their businesses as they're called last night
[46:47.400 --> 46:53.240]  run over and murdered by the looters so so so what about the looters violence we
[46:53.240 --> 46:57.960]  have this unnatural event of millions of people not allowed to defend themselves
[46:57.960 --> 47:04.640]  the the police standing down with their wicked social engineer masters and again
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.840]  I don't know how often you listen Steve but I've been harping on this for years
[47:08.840 --> 47:15.360]  global collapse public not allowed to defend themselves looting running rampant
[47:15.360 --> 47:20.800]  then the public finally relinquishes all liberties to the super state to protect
[47:20.800 --> 47:34.960]  them giant crackdown on entire population that's how it works here absolutely
[47:34.960 --> 47:41.000]  the only hope would be that vigilantes would go out and face these people down
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.800]  and deal with them and and drive them back into the welfare warrants or it's
[47:47.800 --> 47:51.680]  going to continue and that's why the British media is demonizing anybody
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.880]  protecting their shop you know with the baseball bat even as they're run over
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.080]  with cars because they want this to get out of hand but see the natural response
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.360]  is happening to any red-blooded man that sees people running around pulling
[48:04.360 --> 48:08.000]  folks out of cars and burning down businesses and houses any red-blooded
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.560]  person wants to go out instinctively and face these people down it's an ancient
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.720]  instinct that if there's ravaging looters and plunders coming through the
[48:17.720 --> 48:21.920]  countryside that men would just get together and go out and face them down
[48:21.920 --> 48:27.080]  that's the beginning of civilization and so through globalism we're seeing the
[48:27.080 --> 48:34.960]  post-industrial post-civilized world yeah the natural reaction but then I think
[48:34.960 --> 48:39.520]  it's more complex than that in this case because you've got the police standing
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.120]  back doing nothing and then you've got a certain portion of people who do want to
[48:43.120 --> 48:46.840]  do that who do genuinely want to get out and protect their property and their
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.400]  families but you've also got a certain group of people who are just going along
[48:51.400 --> 48:57.880]  the you know the sort of gang division mentality who are just in many ways just
[48:57.880 --> 49:01.680]  as bad as these rioters they just want to get out and smash some heads yeah
[49:01.680 --> 49:05.080]  well that's why people join the military absolutely they want to get out and
[49:05.080 --> 49:08.480]  smash some heads and as long as they're pointed at the right people that's the
[49:08.480 --> 49:12.240]  way it goes as long as those people aren't burning stuff as long as they're
[49:12.240 --> 49:17.600]  not raping as long as armies don't descend into animal activity that's
[49:17.600 --> 49:21.160]  what those instincts are for and if there's people that want to go out and
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.600]  and that's called gangism to want to go out with a baseball bat and face down a
[49:26.600 --> 49:32.240]  bunch of other people and if that's what people find you know to be emboldening
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.040]  to their spirit it's a lot better than sitting inside watching it on the
[49:37.040 --> 49:41.280]  television and letting it happen and I am a primitive at the end of the day but
[49:41.280 --> 49:47.720]  I totally understand people who who instinctively see cities burning and
[49:47.720 --> 49:51.240]  want to go out and face the people down and if there's some thugs wanting to
[49:51.240 --> 49:56.320]  join them well you shall be it it takes a lot of different you know type of people
[49:56.320 --> 49:59.920]  to make the world go around but Steve very interesting article and a very
[49:59.920 --> 50:04.480]  informative article as well by your brother Paul Watson dealing with the
[50:04.480 --> 50:08.000]  fact that the police have now been caught and have admitted they were ordered
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.400]  to be to stand down police were ordered to stand down as London burned it's on
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.040]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com in fact I'm gonna have Paul's article red
[50:17.040 --> 50:21.120]  linked Steve but I think also the good news is baseball bats have gone on
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.960]  record level of sales and have sold out basically in England as folks try to
[50:26.960 --> 50:30.480]  defend themselves so I think that's certainly a good idea Steve have you
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.760]  armed yourself with a baseball bat yet? I haven't got myself a bat yet no I've got
[50:35.760 --> 50:40.480]  lots of blunt instruments flying around though so I can pick up one of those if
[50:40.480 --> 50:47.040]  need be. All right absolutely show them some red coat British steel Stevie all
[50:47.040 --> 50:53.800]  right Steve Watson from prisonplanet.com we disagree a bit on this issue but I
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.560]  see his angle okay we'll be right back I'm gonna give the number out to folks in

[54:36.160 --> 54:43.200]  emergency and you see the fact that the British are absolutely open fair game
[54:43.200 --> 54:47.120]  for the globalist because they bought into this fake idea of genteel
[54:47.120 --> 54:52.240]  civilization giving up their swords giving up their guns letting a
[54:52.240 --> 54:56.640]  professional police force protect them they won't protect you and if you've got
[54:56.640 --> 55:01.640]  guns in New Orleans and you're high and dry with with a generator in your five
[55:01.640 --> 55:05.480]  million dollar mansion the military is gonna come to your door six days later
[55:05.480 --> 55:10.640]  and say hands up we're taking your guns and you're never getting them back not
[55:10.640 --> 55:13.920]  that our individual military men and women are bad not that the average
[55:13.920 --> 55:17.640]  person the British military or the British police is bad but the social
[55:17.640 --> 55:25.880]  engineers on top write handbooks on all this 80 years ago in the US of a
[55:25.880 --> 55:30.440]  hurricane hit and there was devastation the military show up they would be under
[55:30.440 --> 55:34.040]  the command of the governor the governor would say these teams of local
[55:34.040 --> 55:38.280]  sheriffs are gonna lead the military forces on rescue operations clean up
[55:38.280 --> 55:43.200]  and trusted members of the posse to help you and they'd be going to the high and
[55:43.200 --> 55:46.800]  dry houses saying sir will you please get your firearms and come with us we
[55:46.800 --> 55:55.960]  need your help that's America that's freedom not this not this garbage not
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.760]  the US military coming into people's houses and taking their guns and you
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.840]  better believe is this country implodes into hardcore depression ladies and
[56:04.840 --> 56:12.640]  gentlemen 90% right at 90% or agrarian and self-sufficient to some degree or
[56:12.640 --> 56:21.200]  entirely in the 1920s 1930s during the Great Depression 1929 1940 90% or
[56:21.200 --> 56:25.480]  self-sufficient where my family on my dad's side comes from at the end of that
[56:25.480 --> 56:31.240]  depression there wasn't hardly a deer or a possum or a raccoon left in the
[56:31.240 --> 56:38.920]  county people make fun of folks that eat possums let me tell you something when
[56:38.920 --> 56:44.160]  you don't have any money there's no food at the store that's what you eat the
[56:44.160 --> 56:48.480]  point is is that we had seven million people according to major universities
[56:48.480 --> 56:53.200]  starved to death in the ten years of that Great Depression seven million
[56:53.200 --> 57:03.240]  souls starved to death with a country 90% self-sufficient now less 91% new
[57:03.240 --> 57:08.840]  numbers just came out had been 89 a few years ago 91% of people now live in
[57:08.840 --> 57:15.160]  the city and are almost completely unself-sufficient and of the 9% in the
[57:15.160 --> 57:22.200]  country half or less so less than 5% of this country is self-sufficient the
[57:22.200 --> 57:25.760]  globalist have us exactly where they want us they have us in a high-tech
[57:25.760 --> 57:30.520]  domesticated world with a bunch of spoiled rotten welfare people who've
[57:30.520 --> 57:34.400]  been sent through different prisons as they grew up that love their thug
[57:34.400 --> 57:38.360]  gangster culture wearing their hoodies up over their heads and acting all tough
[57:38.360 --> 57:44.080]  as the entire society and the resources are cut off artificially by the
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.080]  globalist to bring in a global meltdown so horrible that will beg for

[58:13.200 --> 58:15.840]  these people and say their revolutionaries and they're great and
[58:15.840 --> 58:19.440]  they're going to be used to menace what's left of the middle class to accept
[58:19.440 --> 58:24.680]  massive tax increases and more welfare so more of the population as the economy
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.720]  crashes goes on welfare so they can get rid of the middle class and only have
[58:28.720 --> 58:32.800]  the ultra-rich and anytime people get up and they they'll just turn a whore to

[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:30.920]  it's very elementary what's happened and I really get frustrated when a lot of
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.080]  people don't even understand elementary things we do you hear we talk about here
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.680]  every day how we predicted all of this with total precision they are turning
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:47.240]  loose the welfare sports rioter who look in mobs all over the world and allowing
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.120]  them to do whatever they want so that so that the middle class will beg to have
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:57.800]  their rights taken away and all of this is being done while the global economy
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.560]  goes into a depression and it's going to get worse and they're letting the
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:07.440]  thugs riot first so that when legitimate people come out and truly
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.560]  politically demonstrate by then the public is going to accept rioters being
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:16.640]  shot on site these people aren't revolutionaries burning down family
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:20.560]  stores and homes and pulling people out of cars their scumbag criminal filth
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.080]  and 99% of the emails I'm getting from England say you're absolutely right I'm

[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.760]  US and that's being covered up by the national news I heard local radio this
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:04.480]  morning saying you know what a caller called it and said you know a lot of
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.600]  this is racial in the US even though the mayor of Philadelphia said it was black
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.240]  they said how dare you say that and hung up on them just political correctness

[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.440]  because there's a war on for your mind
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:18.120]  well 12 years ago in England the United States Europe they all started getting
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:23.640]  the riot police ready we've covered the flash mob reports by the British
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.600]  Ministry of Defense four years ago the Department Defense three years ago
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:32.240]  laying out how all this would happen and how a police state would be needed and
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:36.760]  it'll be executed against the general population that's nonviolent non-criminal
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:40.760]  that's why under this social engineering system it is absolutely
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:46.040]  imperative that the general public be disarmed because you can't play the
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:56.280]  giant poor welfare disenfranchised thug culture that's been popularized by MTV
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:03.320]  and made to be sexy off against the scared chicken neck middle class if you
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.400]  don't have a scared chicken neck middle class and joining us as an American
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:11.680]  journalist who's lived in London for many years and he's done great reports
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.640]  for us from Copenhagen summit and other events is Patrick Henningson and Max
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:22.240]  Kaiser's coming up in about 30 minutes to give us his view on this he scolded us
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.640]  in an email that we had it all wrong this was a glorious liberation happening
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:33.520]  of the iPods and things and I don't usually disagree with Kaiser but but
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.560]  but he'll straighten me out here in a moment after all I'm just a dumb
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:43.240]  American Patrick Henningson you're an American over in London you witnessed
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:49.560]  attacks barricades what appeared to be racial attacks obviously most of this
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.200]  now is just general criminal looting can you give us the full spectrum analysis
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:58.840]  of exactly what's happening because this can't happen in a country in a city
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:02.840]  where the public is armed this this could only this could only happen in
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:07.120]  places like Chicago New York or greater greater England and of course we have the
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.840]  secret immigration program of Tony Blair now they've brought in the the
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:19.760]  entitled groups they have the disheveled drunken British you know kids that were
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:27.320]  born there just as out of control and it is quite a recipe yeah thank you Alex
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:33.840]  thanks yeah listen what you have here what's been expressed in the last three
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.320]  or four days in this country is the culmination of a social experiment that's
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.880]  been going on starting with Margaret Thatcher through ten years of Tony Blair
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:49.160]  government and now obviously into the David Cameron's coalition conservative
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.960]  liberal liberal Democrat government it's a social experiment it's failed horribly
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.880]  and I'll top it off with the point that I wanted to make yesterday which I didn't
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.880]  make was the government in this country have set their priorities over the last
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:09.480]  ten years of bombing and pillaging innocent people in countries like Iraq
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.760]  Afghanistan and most recently in Libya with spending you know eight hundred
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.280]  thousand dollars per cruise missile dropping seven thousand of those in the
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.160]  first week that's where our money is going that's where their priority is and
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:28.920]  they've taken their eye off the ball in this country and sadly I could have told
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.560]  you this is coming a long time ago and so could everybody else in my
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:37.120]  neighborhood and anyone else just lived in the city it's particularly vulnerable
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.000]  to the sort of escalation that we've seen in the last 72 hours you know you've
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.880]  got young kids who've had their culture imported from America what what means
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:52.000]  what's meaningful for British young kids between the age of 12 and 18 American
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.920]  baseball caps Nike trainers track suits hip-hop Snoop Doggy dog this is a
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.720]  culture which isn't even British it's a cheap American import this is what they
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.200]  look up to MTV party let's be honest that fake MTV culture that's only about
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:16.360]  20 years old is a gang prison culture you know the young kids don't know that
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.240]  when they let pants hang down over their hind end that means I am a person who
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.520]  wants to have sex with everybody and get HIV here in the prison all of it is
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:32.720]  about a thug life I'm tough I'm cool the new manhood in America is being on
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.200]  welfare going to prison getting HIV that's that's what our role models are
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:43.080]  not explorers not scientists not firefighters that go into burning
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:49.440]  buildings it is now the lowest of the low common denominator bling garbage
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.840]  psychic warfare evil for the young girls it's cut yourself take drugs lady
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.640]  gaga with dead Chinese political dissidents hanging on meat meat hooks at
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.840]  her events everyone worshipping it just a total culture of flooded death with
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.200]  just zombie-like creatures running around in all directions this is that
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.800]  this is a genius psychic warhead that they've launched into us with precision
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:19.920]  look from an objective point of view you can stay very safely that in this
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.640]  country and in America it's the same you have millions of disaffected youth they
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.880]  have no vision they have no opportunity because all the jobs have been
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.880]  exported to the far east and elsewhere they have essentially no future all they
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.560]  have is this cheap import culture they have brand they have brand they can look
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.360]  up to they have music artists who are way overpaid footballers and athletes or
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.120]  wherever paid that's it that's all they get so these retail riots the mainstream
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.480]  media are saying that oh this is because of austerity cuts and social
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.600]  services have been cut but you know why this is kicked off and into commercial
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.880]  riots it's not because of the government the state hasn't necessarily failed
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.440]  these people it's because the cheap credit was cut off three years ago and I
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.000]  don't know if Max Kaiser will touch on this point but it's not about the state
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.040]  who ultimately controls the prosperity is the banks they cut credit they cut
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.960]  cheap access to easy money the second and third mortgages are gone that was the
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.960]  spending money that parents were giving the kids the holiday loan the car loan
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:26.900]  the loan for the computer paid for your living room furniture three years from
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:34.600]  now now they are totally desperate to obtain not a mate not a job not a
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:38.640]  future they should be fighting the government politically they must attain
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:43.960]  the iPhone the iPad the boombox they must attain it that's what they're
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:48.280]  looting that's what they're robbing the liquor the electronics they're leaving
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:52.120]  the bookstores alone and they're pulling people out of their cars they're
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:57.480]  carjacking people now we have the deaths of vigilantes run over you know trying
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:03.440]  to defend their businesses but but but here's the bigger issue Patrick the
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:06.960]  police now admitted they were ordered to stand down and there's in Cameron's
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.000]  letting this get worse and worse and worse so they can then bring in starting
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.680]  tomorrow all perfectly timed he didn't call back parliament on Monday or
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.000]  Tuesday or Wednesday he called it on Tuesday back for Thursday at its height
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.680]  with more burning and nothing being done they will come in and pass totally
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.880]  draconian laws that will restrict the general public's rights ahead of true
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:33.920]  austerity and crackdowns and they will probably go ahead and say we're gonna
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.040]  start shooting to kill anybody who politically protest I mean what they've
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:42.160]  done they put the first time on British mainland this is not counting Northern
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:47.320]  Ireland they're now authorizing that the police can have rubber bullets or sort
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:51.160]  plastic bullets in their rounds and they will shoot losers on site this is
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.960]  something that is the first time in history on the British mainland this is
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.720]  normal in Belfast of course if you live in Belfast and I've spoken to Northern
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.720]  Irish people and they're just kind of shaking their heads like because if this
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.800]  happened in Belfast basically water cannons would be out they would just be
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.280]  spraying these kids all over the street plastic bullets will be shot and you can
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.840]  disperse crowds quite quickly it's a fine line to walk between law and order
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:19.920]  and the security police state normally we'd have this debate 15 years ago and
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.640]  it'd be a totally different discussion but now the police state has moving so
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:27.920]  far forward into people's lives the state has moved so far forward into
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.000]  people's lives that this is a natural progression for people who are anarchists
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.080]  for people who say they were doing this for freedom and against the
[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.400]  establishment they've just kicked the ball into their own goal because the state
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.880]  will clamp down on Twitter they'll be tracing IP addresses they'll be
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.040]  listening more into your powers to listen to your cell phone your privacy is
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.960]  gone cops on the street maybe soldiers on the street in some cities and the root
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:59.160]  of this is first they had to disarm the Brits and once they've disarmed a
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.120]  population in Chicago in New York it's always the same the criminals all move
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:08.120]  there the welfare people all move there and then a hell is created and it's a
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.680]  total divide and conquer and and and that's the issue you know we can't
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.000]  write an article about hey it's wrong to say shoot arsonist and then not add to
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  the equation this is all been allowed because the public can't defend
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.160]  themselves and the police stood down and let it get to this point people do
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.000]  have a right I mean if you were inside that pub barricaded in Sunday night and
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.920]  they were trying to set fire to you inside of it you would be insane to not
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:39.000]  go out and defend yourself but in this gelded castrated world that is the
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.520]  ultimate crime yeah that's what that's what we've come to is people are waiting
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.160]  for the state to come and sorted out people are saying oh the police are
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:50.480]  they gonna be there are the police gonna be there listen if the if this goes
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.400]  down again I'm good I'm talking to my neighbors we're gonna exchange phone
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.400]  numbers we're gonna have a list if it and everyone's gonna have aluminum
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.800]  baseball bats and crowbars inside their door and if anything's going down I'm
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.600]  calling the neighborhood chain and we're gonna basically make sure everybody's
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.520]  okay and if anything goes down we're blocking off the both ends of our
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:15.320]  streets unless you live here no kids coming in no looting you know no no
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:19.040]  burning it's not gonna happen and by the way as you restore order they will
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:24.480]  send the cops and tell you you can't do it well the prime minister would save a
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:29.600]  whole lot of money and a whole lot of resources if you let communities
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.560]  self-organize a little bit but what that will be that's that's forbidden because
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:37.280]  that's basically saying you're no longer dependent on the state you're no
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.560]  longer dependent on all the massive multi-million dollar contracts cctv
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:47.700]  cameras it's a giant industry this the winner out of this debacle of the last
[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:52.640]  72 hours is the security industry they and notice none of that written with the
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.920]  biggest police state and security grid ever this is where it's happening because
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.520]  it's designed to do this they're letting these people run wild now so that as
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:05.080]  things truly collapse they'll have everything in place and the public
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.480]  behind not allowing any type of demonstration because oh we saw the
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:15.520]  riots of August of 2011 this is the preparatory phase ahead of a total
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:19.560]  clampdown these people are not revolutionaries they're idiot criminals
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.000]  that want iPads if they were real freedom fighters they would have gone into
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.240]  the armories they would have gone after the government and I'm not calling for
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:32.520]  that either but the point is a real revolution like 1776 goes at the
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:36.680]  government at the government and would run that queen and Cameron out of the
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:41.280]  country that this is not a real revolution do you agree Patrick Henningson
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.880]  I agree completely I spent time on the street in the last couple of days I made
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:50.560]  a point to go out stay there stay there with us I've got callers from England

[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:09.920]  minds author Jose Calazzo answers yes in his two new books America's New
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:15.480]  Slavery for more than 13 years author Jose Calazzo has been trying to prove
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:19.920]  that the US government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.760]  revolutionary technology known as fmri functional magnetic resonance imaging
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:30.560]  and there is proof that it exists America's New Slavery explores this
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.180]  technology and its many possible applications in national security who
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:40.320]  has access to it how is it being used does America's salvation rest in this
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.160]  technology these and many other questions are answered in America's New

[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:29.040]  okay Max Kaiser is coming up and I'm gonna have these folks from England give
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:37.320]  them his their perspective on what's going on there is this a revolution or
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.000]  is this a bunch of people using this is an excuse to rob and loot and steal and
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  carjack people and run over folks trying to protect their businesses and kill
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.120]  three of them that's confirmed people are dying and you see this is more like a
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.680]  wild French Revolution we're just rape steal kill do whatever you want I don't
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.840]  want any part of that so-called revolution read led by a bunch of 16
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.760]  year-old zit fate is it faced want to be scum I'm so angry right now folks I
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.680]  can barely even contain myself here on air because we called that all of this
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.200]  was coming in with total precision we knew what was coming we broke it down
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.800]  and now we're watching and unfold and Patrick Henningson living in southern
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.440]  London he gets it he witnessed it he knows what it is but some people are
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.360]  just like total police state kill everybody they don't get it there's
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.800]  other people on the other end saying these are great freedom fighters let
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:34.320]  them let them do whatever they want let them burn down family homes it's
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:39.160]  beautiful and then you've got other people that are just scared when this
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:43.800]  couldn't happen if the Brits were armed now you you said Patrick you're going
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.920]  out in the streets and that you had a message for people go ahead I made a
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.240]  point you know the best time is when this is fresh like after any event you
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:55.200]  grow up you speak to people on the streets in this case I spoke to some
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.840]  young people and some older people in the community and I got mixed messages
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.400]  one of the things I heard over and over again from some of the kids was like we
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:07.000]  brought the police force to their knees we did it and we showed them it is saying
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.560]  to them and I'm saying to them showed you showed them what do you hit the wrong
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.880]  target if you really really would have something revolutionary to express here
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.400]  you'd hit the banks you would hit news corporation you would hit the evening
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.440]  standards of the propaganda and the banking establishment the Bank of
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.120]  England that's that's the heart of the establishment if you really want to rock
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:31.000]  the establishment hit the right targets they're not in the right target but this
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.280]  this whole thing there is evidence that this is engineered this there's a fine
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.680]  little corrupt dance between private security companies the police force and
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:44.680]  organized crime they all linked in a business triangle and all around the
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.440]  world but especially in this country and obviously in America the gang and
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.160]  certain members of the police force all cops are not corrupt most of them are
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.680]  good people most of them are hard but it's like the ATF caught ship and cocaine
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:02.320]  and guns now it's it's always been the police with select crime gangs and the
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:06.240]  private security forces that's where the 500 billion a year in drug money in the
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:09.840]  US goes of course it's system run and that's it's now coming out the sharp
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.440]  dress men we're coordinating all of this from the beginning that's up on info
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:18.840]  wars.com so you're absolutely right and and the police admitting the stand down
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:25.000]  right there there's the proof this is pointed at hard-working brits but there's
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.800]  also another big massive danger here in the reordering after this the next phase
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.440]  I predict will be racial tension this will spill over between Indian
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.760]  Pakistani black and white communities and now you will see whenever there's an
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.320]  economic depression in Europe there's always the rise of a right-wing extreme
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:49.840]  right-wing groups a fascist British National Party UKIP they will have a
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:55.360]  bigger seat at the table now. Anders Brevik a few weeks ago in his manifesto
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  a right-wing extremist was saying the failure of multiculturalism and
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  magically we have this complete mayhem breaking out in Britain only weeks later
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:10.040]  and the British Defense League has pledged a thousand people as foot soldiers
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.440]  to protect communities so I think you're going to see a trend in the next sort of
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:20.360]  five to six years the economy is not going to rebound quicker than that you're
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.000]  gonna see the rise of right-wing extremists and these kind of splinter
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.920]  groups like you did in the 70s so if that's kind of frightening for me
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:35.280]  because basically they're going to have a bigger voice at the table and and
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.560]  they're being used and they're infiltrated by the alphabet super
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:45.000]  agencies as bad as any any groups and I don't see anything positive coming out
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.760]  of what we've seen here in England which is total anarchy in the last three
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:56.200]  four days. Well I totally agree with you and this whole thing is scripted they
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:59.480]  need to have everybody clashing with each other while the megabanks rob
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.920]  everybody and if this is the vanguard of the revolutionaries going after family
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:11.040]  homes and fourth and fifth generation family shops boy heaven help us and
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.040]  and that's exactly what the social engineers are going to do they're going
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:17.680]  to play the giant underclass off against the middle class and then the
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:21.920]  government will play the part of the arbiter the referee this is the divide
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:29.520]  and conquer strategy that we literally beat to death here on earth here on the
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:35.520]  air Patrick Henningson 21st century wire.com we look forward to speaking to

[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:08.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.320]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:16.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:20.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:32.980]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:01.480]  yeah peace cells Al Gore called for an Arab Spring in the United States last
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:09.560]  week and CNBC is trusted folks are saying this is because of austerity and I'm
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:12.960]  sure that has something to do with it but the larger issue is the rise of
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:20.640]  football hooliganism where you yes a nice word I just in a vented we're all
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:28.120]  over the world in Brazil and the US and South Africa Boston Vancouver rioting
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:34.200]  burning carjacking when the team wins or loses now when we say these are young
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.760]  revolutionaries you know I thought revolutionaries went into government
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.000]  armories and got guns and tried to storm the parliament and the French
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.160]  Revolution they stormed the Bastille our founding fathers here in the US went
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:54.640]  up against the British military but some are saying that this is the vanguard of
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:02.520]  a political uprising and if it is I can't say I'm part of this that I support
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:07.560]  this type of political movement by young welfare recipients predominantly
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:13.960]  against well family dwellings on fire women jumping out of them fourth and
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:24.240]  fifth generation clothing stores watch stores also don't forget evil shoe
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:30.520]  stores I can't say that I see that as the enemy you know the police now admit
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:34.640]  today that's in mainstream news they they were ordered to stand down and it's
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:39.120]  also being reported all over England that youths were offered money to start
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:45.840]  riots by people claiming to be part of the media and so it gets started and
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.360]  then the government can pass notice they're waiting four days to let things
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:54.960]  really get out of control before the parliament comes back in tomorrow
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.640]  especially called and then of course they'll pass draconian laws curfews on
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:06.240]  everyone TSA style checkpoints and then everyone will lose their liberties and
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:11.320]  that's how it always works I've seen this over and over again and it's a very
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.760]  very dangerous yes I do support getting rid of these corrupt governments and
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.680]  then you know we had an article that was linked all over the web just on Monday
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.720]  pollsters Americans are pre-revolutionary and so the system all over the
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.320]  world is letting these out-of-control welfare riots iPod riots happen ahead
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:34.520]  of putting in draconian rules against everybody and I've predicted this
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.480]  ethnosium like a broken record and Rasmussen is finding the US is
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:45.480]  pre-revolutionary I just hope that that the revolution is it targeting shoe
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.720]  stores because and of course I really don't want to have things be violent
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:53.720]  but I mean if they are gonna be violent this isn't gonna hurt the
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:58.400]  establishment to to have a family dwellings being burned and women jumping
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.040]  out of them or people being being car jacked which we've confirmed from
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.640]  reporters that have witnessed it it's been videotaped on the ground but
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:12.120]  joining us is reporter for I don't know RT Greek TV British TV talk show host you
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:17.640]  name it needs no introduction Max Kaiser of the Kaiser report and Max what's
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:23.640]  your view on this is this thuggery or glorious revolution well I mean I see a
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:29.120]  connection obviously with what I've been calling the global insurrection
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:36.720]  against banker occupation every city in different countries are going through
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.600]  this in different ways so London is going through it differently than Athens
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:50.920]  or Tunis or Madrid or Dublin or even Madison Wisconsin but when you have a
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.880]  society that valorizes looting and this is covered actually in a book by
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:03.120]  Frederick Basquiat in 1850 who said this is post French Revolution explained
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.080]  that when the privileged classes use the government for legalized plunder that
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:14.080]  you encourage the lower classes to revolt using plunder so what's happening
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:17.800]  in London is on one hand they're plundering or you could say they're
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.960]  trying to get a job at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan because they are mimicking
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.920]  their overlords they are mimicking what they see happening in their society
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.240]  like why isn't Jamie Diamond and why isn't why aren't they down there trying to
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:37.120]  recruit these kids to be part of their bank because they're setting the
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.880]  example okay well max around a second I thought I was gonna disagree with you
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.280]  but I actually totally agree when you send us an email saying hey Alex you
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:49.240]  don't quite get it you know I now I do actually get it and you're absolutely
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:53.160]  right when we have giant prison populations and young people are thrown
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:57.440]  into them for almost no reason they become part of the criminal culture and
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.360]  they see that the mega banks don't get in trouble they see that there's no rule
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.920]  of law they see that the formula one owner all over the world gets his race
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:11.480]  tracks paid for with taxpayer money not just tax incentives but actually it's
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:15.720]  paid when they see his daughter getting four billion dollar gift from him when
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.160]  they see trillions being stolen when they see all of this happening then they
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:26.160]  say hey this is a criminal society let's go for it so if you're saying it from
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.000]  that perspective I do agree with you my only issue is they're gonna use this
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.840]  now to further clamp down on everybody in England by the police standing down
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:43.960]  that's coming anyway because of this tension that's going on this war the
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:47.800]  war that I see and I've been talking about it for ten years is between the
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:52.240]  speculators who want interest rate to the zero and people who have jobs or want
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:55.680]  to save money who want interest rates higher now what did Ben Bernanke just say
[01:39:55.680 --> 01:40:00.680]  he said he's gonna keep interest rates near zero for another two years this is
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:06.920]  plunder this is unconscionable this is causing enormous financial
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.240]  dislocation it's a form of financial oppression and I would go so far as to
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:17.080]  call it financial apartheid because in America if you're part of the underclass
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:21.440]  for example they use interest rates to to create the new Jim Crow laws or
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:25.440]  financial apartheid if you're part of the elite you get to borrow money it's
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.240]  negative 2% if you're borrowing money in a credit card or a payday loan you're
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:36.160]  borrowing money at 35 or 40 percent or higher guaranteed to impoverish you so
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:40.760]  they use interest rates like they used to use those Jim Crow laws or as you see
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.640]  in South Africa during the apartheid regime they're creating through
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.680]  financial apartheid a permanent underclass and keeping interest rates at
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:55.000]  zero percent is key the Bernanke see these riots are horrible of course but
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.520]  let's not forget Bernanke and and the Mervyn King who's over there at the Bank
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:04.240]  of England those guys are the master plunderers that these kids are mimicking
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.760]  and they are getting away with incredible fraud and confiscation of wealth
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:14.280]  and plunder and and this is really what needs to be focused on and it would be
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:19.800]  say to me well they're gonna use this to clamp down and bring in more police
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:24.920]  state etc that trend isn't that that train is left to station Alex nothing is
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:31.000]  gonna stop that and so you've got these uprights I agree with you but but but if
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.200]  let me tell you're not gonna see stuff like that here in Austin Texas because
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:39.760]  the people have a right and a duty to defend themselves it can only happen in
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.200]  the New York's the Chicago's the England's where the people have been
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:50.320]  disarmed but I agree with you Max I think this overall is a diversion and if
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.040]  these young people would have tried to attack the big mega banks if they would
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.840]  have tried to go into Parliament or into the Royal Palaces then they would
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.440]  have been met with not rubber bullets but with leaden full metal jacket
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.080]  bullets instantly so so that's all you need to know right there is that they've
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.400]  been allowed to do this because the social engineers think they're gonna get
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:16.000]  a major power out of it but let's look at what's happening to the global markets
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.680]  when you are breaking down the interest rates obviously that signifies they're
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:26.160]  gonna continue to devalue the dollar we saw over the weekend Greenspan tell meet
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:33.240]  the prostitutes on meet the press that indeed they'll just print money to pay
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:38.040]  off the debt well that signifies hyperinflation so where are we going
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:43.680]  Max Kaiser from your research I mean is the acceleration towards worldwide
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:49.600]  financial collapse accelerating or where are we on the chart I'll tell you
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.800]  where exactly we're going we're going toward something called the negative
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.880]  interest rate the Swiss are now charging people to keep money at their bank
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:06.120]  and a bank in America is now charging their highest deposit customers charge
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:10.560]  of keeping cash at the bank which is a negative interest rate so if you keep
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.920]  your money at the bank at the end of the year you're gonna have one or two percent
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.840]  left of it the bank is just gonna take it from you and they'll say that the
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.960]  reason they're doing this is you need to put your money into the stock market to
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:28.000]  get this economy going and again that's a form of financial oppression or
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.640]  financial apart and let me add to this federal courts have now ruled even a
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:36.960]  thousand dollars at your home with a bank receipt can be confiscated so you
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:41.920]  keep it here we take it and if you keep it at home we take it I mean this is
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:47.040]  incredibly lawless and it's all designed while they're stealing your money the
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:53.240]  inflation on top of it I mean this is absolute war against everyone but the
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:57.680]  big six mega banks who literally get the tens of trillions of taxpayer bailout
[01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:02.480]  money to themselves and then hoard it I mean this is an economic global takeover
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.760]  how do we counter the max well the people who have seen the writing on the
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:13.640]  wall the people on your show Gerald Salante Peter Schiff Mark Trauber Max
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:19.040]  Kaiser get on the list what have we been saying gold is the only non-corruptible
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:24.120]  form of money and of course it's breaking out hitting new all-time highs as we
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:27.640]  speak and that is going to continue it's actually melting up at this point
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:32.600]  because the realization that these types of uprisings that you're seeing around
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:36.160]  the world including London they're just going to spread and they're just going
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.400]  to keep getting more and more out of control I mean he can't once the genies
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:44.200]  out of the bottle you can't go back and say well your your uprisings are in
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:47.440]  London we'd like you to wear a different color we'd like you to rearrange the
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.920]  furniture and can you do it can you quiet down a little bit because you're
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.080]  disturbing the peace I mean once the genies out of the bottle you don't know
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:57.080]  how it's going to manifest in different cultures you say it's not going to
[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.280]  happen in the United States like it's happening in London that's correct but
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:03.040]  it will happen then it's going to happen in a different way just like it's
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:07.560]  happened differently in all these other countries but it's a global insurrection
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:11.960]  they're a part of that global insurrection I know that in the UK and the
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:16.880]  BBC and these other UK press outlets that they are low to refer to it as having
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.320]  any political component whatsoever but that is to be blind to what's happening
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:29.320]  around the world as this elite banking cartel confiscates wealth and brings
[01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:34.000]  about this financial apartheid in a permanent underclass and this it's
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.680]  causing these these these up these uprisings everywhere this is just
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:42.720]  another chapter another example of something that's been in place now for
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:47.120]  the last three years it's only going to grow how you know in Madison, Wisconsin
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:51.640]  they had a bit of an uprising very peaceful they try to kick out Scott Walker
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:57.480]  who is imposing financial apartheid they failed but it'll pop up somewhere else
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:02.040]  and what form it takes we don't quite know yet but it will happen in some form
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:08.320]  the revolution in Egypt is ongoing the revolution in Tunisia is ongoing the
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.320]  people in Dublin have yet to show their true hand how they're going to deal with
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.680]  their financial oppression the people in Greece the same thing but this is all
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:24.600]  we're all together now because the global banking cartel has instituted
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:30.480]  negative interest rates which means that you will never ever accumulate any
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:35.280]  wealth whatsoever and they've legalized confiscation of wealth they've completely
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.320]  legalized plunder so you look at kids plundering in London and they're saying
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:43.400]  oh my god look at these kids yes terrible but what about Goldman Sachs what
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:49.560]  about JP Morgan not here you max it's your audio is kind of degenerating are
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.520]  you on a speakerphone no I'm not I'm on my landline I don't know why it's
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:47:04.960]  degenerating I don't know are you on a headset no it's just kind of watery
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:08.200]  we'll call the cell phone during the break I just really want to hear what
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:12.680]  you have to say well well max where does it go because the banks give themselves
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:16.840]  trillions in interest tree or negative money then for everybody who isn't
[01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:21.560]  being given the free money it destroys those of us that work for it they've
[01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:27.080]  obviously premeditatedly done this they built a giant police state in place to
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:33.440]  protect this conversion from a free market society to a crony insider
[01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.080]  monopoly system and they're getting ready their new wars what do you make of
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.840]  S&P who certified all the derivatives garbage for the banks knowingly paid by
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:49.640]  them coming in and getting rid of the triple-a rating of the US the states
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:54.360]  now having their ratings lowered the counties the cities all to the very
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:59.760]  zombie banks our ratings are cut to them who are the most insolvent most
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:05.040]  fraudulent out there as the only sector in the economy that's doing well is the
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.880]  insiders the general electrics who are exempt from the laws they get passed the
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.560]  megabanks who were exempt from the laws they get passed I mean how long can this
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:20.280]  go on or is it too sophisticated for the fluoride head population are we doomed
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:25.920]  Wall Street is always looking for new sources of revenue we understand that
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:32.000]  they created sub-time which is the toxic waste of paper to make noodles of money
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.360]  off of fraud and then they blew that market up they're always looking for
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:40.800]  new ways what they figured out is that the US Treasury bond market which is
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.760]  triple-a is huge but you can't make a lot of money on it because it's triple-a
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:52.200]  and the spreads and the liquidity and the volatility is very low so my S&P
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.760]  lowering the rating of the US Treasury bond you now have volatility and these
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:02.240]  increased spreads this is great for Wall Street because they make money on the
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.880]  chaos and the confusion and that really will continue to go down because as it
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:11.520]  goes down it creates huge amounts of volatility and treating and commissions
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.440]  for Wall Street this is another avenue for Wall Street to create huge amounts
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:23.520]  of revenue and bonuses by trashing the US triple-a rating and moving it down to a
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.640]  lesser rating which means it'll become like a jump bond so it's constantly
[01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:31.480]  up and down you see the volatility in the last three days as a result this is
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:35.280]  exactly what I said what happened that volatility would increase and that's
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:41.520]  because the insiders who do you think makes money with that Wall Street why
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.200]  do you think they lowered their rating to make chaos and trading profits it's their new source of revenues
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:51.280]  well that's it and plus they're the insiders it's come out reportedly that
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:55.600]  somebody made an 80 million dollar bet that's made them 10 billion dollars
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:59.360]  somebody knew that the debt rating was going to be lowered a month ago and the
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:03.480]  Daily Mail and others think it's Lord Soros but the point is imagine for all
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:08.920]  these big insiders who have all the insider information on the schizophrenic
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:14.400]  helter-skelter rising and falling that we've seen on the stock markets in the
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:19.680]  last few days just imagine the wealth that they're creating in this process of
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:23.560]  command destruction now now max hopefully we can keep you a little bit in the

[01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:20.920]  phone line and dropped but we've got him back now look I understand Max's
[01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:25.800]  frustration I've got it I'm gonna be honest with you I am beside myself with
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:32.000]  anger right now because everything we predicted is happening I'm very upset
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.160]  gold hit $1800 today I'm very upset they announced they're gonna keep
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:42.360]  interest rates at zero which means negative for the big banks that means
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.760]  total deep dollar devaluation I mean this country is gonna be a hellhole this
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:51.840]  is all about design and and I know Max is trying to stop it I'm trying to stop
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:56.600]  it and I even get Max's point even if they're burning down houses and stuff
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.680]  and they are thugs at least they're doing something I mean when you're wait
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:06.000]  when you're at least the action shows there's some life left there and that
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.760]  people are angry and maybe it'll lead to something I mean I get it I just see the
[01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.640]  government manipulating it disarming the public to allow this to happen and it
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:21.600]  just shows me how diabolical it is to have social engineers running things and
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:28.020]  it's so sophisticated that and it's also so simple at the same time how do you
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:31.520]  get the general public to figure this out now I haven't asked if Max can stay
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.000]  a little bit in the next hour because I want to get more into the economy with
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.400]  him and all his predictions that unfortunately have come true almost
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.360]  every one of them and where things are going and how folks can protect
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.220]  themselves but I've got to get to Tony oh Steve Patrick and Matthew from the
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:50.680]  UK they've been holding for about 30 40 minutes Kaiser will you hold 15 20
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:56.440]  minutes with us into the next hour okay okay fantastic let's go to Tony oh in
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:01.960]  England back to the riots what's your view on what's happening over there hi
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.840]  Alex yes well it's not revolution it might have started off as a possible
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:10.960]  beginning of revolution well the police as you know we've operated a stand-down
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:16.120]  operation basically it's turned into opportunistic criminality and violence
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:20.920]  for the powers that be will not let this opportunity go to waste and on Thursday
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:26.000]  we will see as a good word you use more draconian laws and a complete
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.680]  evisceration of what rights we think we have left after our terrorist act one
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.120]  and two your equivalent of the Patriarch one and two were put in place it's
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:39.160]  going down no rapidly Alex yeah I've seen the video of them dragging folks out
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:43.840]  of cars burning down houses at every instinctive level I want to go get the
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:47.040]  street and attack those people and then I hear folks saying well that's
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.920]  vigilantism when the police don't protect you it's not bad too instinctively
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.960]  when marauding men are running around burning things and attacking people to
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:02.440]  want to attack them and I'm not taking sides here the social engineers have
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:07.320]  been caught now allowing this to get out of control and again I want to ask the
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:11.520]  question why aren't the looters going after the government because if they go
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.760]  after government buildings they're going to get shot deader than a hammer
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:20.200]  anything else you want to add Tony a very eloquent yet just one more point and
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:24.680]  this is the opportunity to show the world what the word anarchy really means
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:30.320]  society standing together for each other but one final point why you've got
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:35.000]  max on could not please enlighten me why silver hasn't moved in relation to gold
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:45.040]  recently max no yeah well these two have been moving in relation to each other
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:50.560]  for 10 years they've been both averaging between 21 and 22 percent gains per
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:57.240]  year for 10 years silver is up over 30 percent this year gold is up again this
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:01.520]  year there is a relationship is going back for 10 years if you look at any
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:07.200]  one or two months period of time you can see a divergence but of course that
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.360]  would be foolish you need to look at it at least over a one-year period of time
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:16.400]  and this is kind of a short-sightedness that we see operating in these riots in
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.600]  London because people are looking at this what happened in one night or two
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:22.200]  night and drawing conclusions from it and they're failing to look at the
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:27.960]  historical and global stay there max I'm trying to bring in some context here of
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:32.280]  an historic and global nature no stay there we got a go to break but I agree
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.120]  with you now that I see your perspective and yes to the caller you're looking at
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.880]  a snapshot of gold and silver not a 10-year or one-year graph we'll be right

[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:47.640]  to really detail what's happening in the command destruction global banker
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.240]  occupation and the resistance to it I want to get into why zero interest
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.080]  rates or negative interest rates are so destructive and I also want to get into
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:01.440]  his future perspective on the economy I agree with him there is world revolution
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:07.680]  and a lot of times you'll see it you know the first tremors of it with the
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:12.520]  under disadvantaged class that will strike out in ways that are that are
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:16.400]  counterproductive but he's saying it's an indicator of things to come and I
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:20.440]  agree with him on that so we'll be looking at that coming up after I get to
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:24.680]  Steve Patrick Matthew and others Steve in the UK then Patrick and Matthew Steve
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:29.880]  what's your view on what's happening over in the UK now into day four oh hi
[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:35.200]  Alex hi max and I just want to get the points across that this is not global
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:40.080]  insurrection against banker occupation these guys who are doing the looting are
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:45.320]  doing the thieving are playing thugs that's all they are Alex the thugs what
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:50.200]  what they're doing is the government's a front-run this this violence like the
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.960]  front-run the stocks like the front front-run everything else they're
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:58.960]  front-loading exactly as I said they are allowing this to happen they could
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:03.080]  trigger at any time they control the gang member leaders like the ATF controls
[02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:07.520]  the cocaine and guns they've been caught publicly they allow it to happen
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.840]  front-running knowing resistance coming now they've branded it as thugs with
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:17.560]  pants down around their knees burning family shops so they can then pass the
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:22.720]  laws Thursday to then attack people that actually insurrect against the
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.320]  austerity absolutely right you said it's so simply anything else well it only
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.800]  only is Alex I mean a slightly could be with max because people feel and Alex
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.600]  people are really feeling the austerity but I think max is being is giving them
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:41.800]  far too much credibility I spoke to these people on the street they don't
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:48.200]  know they don't know that they don't know the intricacies of the banks what
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.880]  the banks are doing all they can see is they're paying more they're getting less
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.800]  money and basically they're getting screwed and that's what the fighting
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:03:02.280]  against the bankers are gonna misdirect them right into our our faces yeah they
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.760]  gone out on the street and the same right we're gonna take now we're gonna
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:09.880]  take whatever we want we're just gonna Steve we're gonna loot we're gonna ban
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.520]  and that's their answer it's nothing they don't realize what the banks have
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:19.360]  done to us all they all they can see is the effect of it all right well well
[02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:23.480]  said max do you see his perspective I know you say the police state train
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:27.280]  already left the station but by the police standing down and allowing this
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:32.000]  when this and then the media that's the real kicker they're branding it as
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.160]  political when it's not then they're now front-loading as the caller said and
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:43.000]  demonizing legitimate rebellion deterring well to say that the the the
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.360]  folks on the street riding don't know the intricacies of the banking system
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:51.800]  it reminds me of that Bob Dylan line you don't have to be a weatherman to know
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:57.440]  which way the wind blows in other words three years ago the UK bailed out these
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:03.440]  banks and to pay for the bailout they imposed draconian austerity measures as
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:08.560]  night follows day when you confiscate wealth from a whole class of people you
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.000]  can expect riot that this crime was committed three years ago the crimes
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.600]  are seeing in the last three days are the symptoms the effects of the major
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:23.240]  crime of three years ago that was never prosecuted prosecute the original crime
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:29.240]  I agree I agree I agree prosecute Barclays Bank prosecute Fred the Shred over at
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:34.040]  Royal Bank of Scotland prosecute the real criminals three years ago they've
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.280]  never been prosecuted to point the finger at now a few kids burning a few
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:42.360]  buildings and of course it's gonna happen if you destroy their society and
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:46.560]  steal all their wealth this is exactly I know I know but see the genius of them
[02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:53.160]  triggering it like an oil field expert using dynamite to blow out an oil well
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.360]  that's on fire you can see how they then use the crisis they create to get even
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:02.720]  more power Patrick and Matthew straight ahead a very wealthy US citizen is
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:07.680]  predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in
[02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.840]  more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way

[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:26.880]  predicted the collapse of GM Bannie Mae Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.120]  owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire

[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:49.640]  Aaron Dykes ahead of the weeknight 7 o'clock 30 minute news show at prison
[02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:53.120]  planet dot TV then we're gonna launch a new site that's mainly just a news site
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:56.360]  to have all the prison planet dot TV stuff on it and we've got a lot of little
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:00.560]  networks and TV systems that want to pick it up so very excited about that
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.360]  going back to callers from England with Max Kaiser them and get into the
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:08.560]  economy that Max again has really called what was gonna happen three years
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.840]  ago banker bailout he said two or three years from now the austerity measures
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:16.320]  will start kicking in the stimulus will end you're gonna see him hold the
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.240]  interest rates you're gonna see him totally rape the public you're gonna
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:23.960]  see gold up to $2,000 by the end of the year he was saying that at the start of
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:29.480]  the year now JP Morgan Chase came out yesterday and said 2,500 an ounce by
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:34.960]  December or higher the and that's that's the insiders telling you that so
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.680]  we'll be talking about that in a moment but right now Patrick in England your
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:46.960]  view on the hooligans I mean for me it's it's it's it's really just the same
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:53.480]  type sports fans we see rioting in LA Chicago New York Brazil South Africa
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:58.680]  black white doesn't matter all the same disgusting weird thug-ish sports
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:05.360]  culture that we just see all over the place really expanding and where men's
[02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:12.240]  manhood now is is all about how spindly necked and thug like they are but what's
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.280]  your view on it hello Alex just a quick mention thank you for all your
[02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:21.960]  information that you're getting out to the public in England there's a there's
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:26.760]  a wide wide sort of spectrum of people that do understand what's going on but
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:31.440]  it is the bankers that have orchestrated this it's very obvious not to the thugs
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:36.120]  on the streets which I obviously totally condone but one thing that people may
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:42.040]  not be aware of on Saturday night after the initial peaceful protest in London
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:46.560]  outside the police station there was a theater nearby there was actually showing
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:52.720]  a show that night by coincidence of people being trapped in a theater
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:57.840]  because there was riots going on outside I mean this woman from New York she was
[02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:02.040]  involved with the theater she came on the either Sky News or BBC I forget which
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:07.320]  one and said wow what a coincidence and we know that the globalists like to take
[02:11:07.320 --> 02:11:11.080]  the mickey out of people like that but I totally condemn the violence and the
[02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:14.320]  destruction that's going on but it's just a strange coincidence I like your
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:17.680]  thoughts on that well we know they ran drills with exact same targets being hit
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:24.640]  at the exact same time on 7 7 also 9 11 but if you go to prisonplanet.com we've
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.000]  got multiple reporters on the ground in England including Patrick Henningson has
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.880]  been reporting for us but Steve Watson in London Paul Watson north of London
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:38.560]  police were ordered to stand down as London burned continuing we are the
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:44.800]  infield army video of locals chasing rioters in London so folks are definitely
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:48.600]  and that will short circuit the globalist if citizens start standing up
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:52.200]  against the looters the globalist aren't gonna be able to fully use this in
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.800]  fact look for government to try to block the citizens next from defending
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:59.640]  themselves we've seen England we've seen the UK arrest people who've defended
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.760]  themselves in their own homes stocks tumble at open amid economic fears
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:10.880]  continuing there's reports that youths were offered money to start the riots
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:19.320]  and so that's some of the reports we've got there but that's my take on it what's
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:23.440]  your take Max Kaiser these people have been financially oppressed this is
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.680]  financial apartheid and they have had their financial rights deprived from
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:33.240]  them somebody needs to communicate with these people and to reach out to these
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:37.560]  people because they have a they have a right the right to grieve for grievance
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:43.840]  they've been basically put into a prison of financial tyranny effectively and
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:49.440]  there was like a prison riot because it's completely again using the apartheid
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:53.960]  example you know we need like a Nelson Mandela type figure to save us for the
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:58.240]  rights of these financially oppressed there be we take over the machine to get
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:03.400]  money to get ten quid ten pounds they're charged one pound that's unconscionable
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:09.040]  but Max look it'd be one thing if they went at the parliament or if they went
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:13.920]  at one of the palaces or when Brett spontaneously attacked Camilla and Charles
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:17.920]  pop up fees in the UK now nobody can afford a proper education nobody can
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:21.320]  afford proper food they're all being medicated they're all being oppressed and
[02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.760]  you know we're arguing about they're not eloquent enough in their speech for
[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:28.560]  their rights well they need representation we need to represent well look
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:33.480]  a large portion of these people I've said it over and over again they're
[02:13:33.480 --> 02:13:37.480]  gonna use the imported welfare immigrant populations who believe in gun
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.840]  control and socialism in every country because that's what their paymasters
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:45.360]  tell them to believe they're gonna use them to riot to then crack down on
[02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:49.360]  everybody else and there's no doubt that a lot of these people are still getting
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.280]  their free housing their welfare checks they just can't buy enough iPods and
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.840]  they're looting stores for iPods and burning down family businesses what
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:03.200]  about the victims of of of their attacks Max that's my issue they're all
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:08.240]  victim the people who on both sides of the explaining the riot are the victims
[02:14:08.240 --> 02:14:13.880]  of the looters and the city of London and these people are being financially
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:17.360]  let me ask this Max what would have happened what would have happened if the
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:21.560]  if the looters would have gone down to ten Downing Street do you think there
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:27.800]  have been some real bullets being fired at them back they don't have enough of
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:34.960]  wherewithal or self-awareness to pick through the proper actions to get their
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.200]  grievances heard that's why we need to help them represent themselves I don't
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.640]  know the starving sir French knew where the government buildings were yeah
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:48.640]  that's right and it was all started by the same for the same reason the French
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.400]  introduced the asset yacht which is a currency of the period backed by
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:57.440]  collateralizing church property the exact same scam that we saw in the UK and
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:01.040]  America today collateralizing mortgages and creating a currency around that and
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:05.800]  it bankrupted the country and they revolted here you've got the UK
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.280]  government is collateralized property to back the UK pound which is inherently
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:14.320]  worthless and now people's purchasing powers collapsing they're flooding the
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.880]  market with more of these worthless asset not British pound and there's a
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.520]  riot there's a revolution it's happening well here's what I want different
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:24.360]  stages all over the world different flavors all over the world you got to
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:28.920]  give it the historical and global context no I hear you but here's what I want
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:33.080]  same boat you're in the same boat I'm in the same boat they're in the same boat
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:38.720]  we're all being oppressed by so I agree with you I agree with you but at the same
[02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:44.480]  time we should be able to then say this is not the way to do a revolution we
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:50.960]  need to go with the 1776 model that I know that you admire and so we need to
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:59.520]  push worldwide 1776 not worldwide 1789 French Revolution nobody is pushing
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:05.080]  anybody out of the banks currently okay you're not doing it I'm not doing it
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:10.200]  nobody's doing it Obama's not doing it David Cameron's not doing it nobody's
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:14.600]  pushing the corrupt bankers out of their offices today nobody okay and the
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.800]  result is riots and until you get rid of the corrupt plundering class in the
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.840]  city of London expect more riots that's the recipe now Iceland didn't take over
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:28.080]  the banks Iceland did take over the banks though so maybe it should be a
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:34.800]  1776 Icelandic model Iceland is a starling example they push back against
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.320]  the banks and they prosecuted but they're trying to prosecute bankers gets
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:42.760]  more those bankers went for state harbor Alex who escaped Iceland they went to
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:47.800]  London London for state harbor to corrupt bankers all over the world that's
[02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:51.080]  why the real estate market in the high end goes up in London because they offer
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:55.000]  state harbor for financial criminals from Iceland in particular who stole
[02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.440]  bill that's where all the Russian oligarchs that's where all the Russian
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:03.720]  oligarchs went I agree that's where all the oligarchs are they're in London and
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:07.440]  they take all those because London is the hedge fund capital the world and the
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:11.440]  money laundering capital of the way did you know in the last two years almost all
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:15.960]  of the Israeli oligarchs have fled to the city of London within London right
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:20.440]  now so now tell me about the riots in Brixton of course the people are
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:25.440]  riding because their country is a sham it's a shameful despotic stuff
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:32.080]  money laundering why don't you go to Brixton and lead them against the
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:48.000]  city of London I'll guarantee you you're not listening to me George Kaiser I
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:54.080]  know that you thought that was sarcastic I'm saying I mean you're saying
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:58.840]  nobody's leading the charge I'm not saying you should I'm saying it sounds
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:04.560]  like you're about to are you gonna lead us George look the scariest thing that
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.320]  for the British Parliamentary system the Brit politicians in Britain today
[02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:12.640]  would be if there's a sudden groundswell of people saying these riders have
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:15.960]  rights you're infringing on their rights they're not the problem you're the
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:20.160]  problem and then they go down and they say we represent the riders they don't
[02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:22.960]  really can articulate the problem because you've dumbed them down and
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:26.840]  medicated them so badly in department of education and turned them into
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:31.040]  basically intellectual Unix we're here to represent them because you screwed
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.240]  them that's what the people calling into your show today should be worried
[02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.160]  about talking about not condemning their brothers and sisters across the street
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:42.280]  who have been slaughtered by financial apartheid they should be going down
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:46.840]  where it's more sophisticated than that George George hold on it's more
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:51.560]  sophisticated than that we recognize that they have helped trigger this to then
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:55.600]  demonize the legitimate rebellion against the city of London that the
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:02.000]  globalists and their actuaries know is coming just like our report here it's
[02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.400]  not coming it's here it's here all in cities all over the world and it's
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.000]  growing every single day and it's one big global insurrection and it's
[02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:13.040]  happening in cities everywhere you know what okay so somebody's gonna come burn
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:17.440]  my house or burn our studios instead of instead of going after the city of
[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:22.120]  London or I mean I'm just saying that's what that's wrong yeah but if nobody
[02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:27.280]  puts a line in the sand against the bankers you and me and everyone else
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:30.840]  are gonna be cobbled up by this inferno we're going to break I think you've hit
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.440]  the nail on the head here though I think you really have crystallized it the
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:39.160]  bankers plan is to implode society and set off shore while they do it then
[02:19:39.160 --> 02:19:42.200]  come in come in and buy everything ever pays on the dollar it's either the
[02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:47.080]  bankers or us we must get the fractional reserve fraudulent debt money system out
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:51.560]  of here we must go back to constitutional money or we are facing a
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.880]  road warrior scenario and I totally agree with Max on that front I've got to
[02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:00.440]  get into the economy with him as well and I want to go to more callers in

[02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:33.280]  great and though the news was rather sad well I just had to laugh I saw the
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:43.840]  photograph he blew his mind out in a car all right Matthew and Ian in England
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:46.960]  we're gonna leave it at that when calls from England will take more tomorrow
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:50.800]  Max gonna stay a little bit later in the hour now because I really want to pick
[02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:57.160]  his brain on where he sees future trends going but as Max keeps saying and as I've
[02:24:57.160 --> 02:25:02.280]  been saying and every other analyst we have on this global banking cartel system
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:10.160]  is designed as a financial black hole to not create an economy or a society to
[02:25:10.160 --> 02:25:15.120]  not empower through a credit system but through a negative credit system that
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:20.520]  destroys everything in its path and we're now entering the in-game face when
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:24.160]  I'm sitting around at night with my wife going to sleep at midnight I mean I'm
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.480]  holding her hand and we are literally praying to God because I understand how
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:34.160]  dangerous this is a depression now a global collapse now a sustained global
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:39.600]  collapse with the way the public is today decadent doesn't know how to grow
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:46.080]  tomatoes nothing is going to be hellish and it's still not too late to turn it
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:49.160]  around we'll talk about that with Max Kaiser in the next segment in the short
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:55.560]  segment Matthew and Ian Matthew Matthew just hung up as I was going to him Ian
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:59.640]  in England Ian you're on the air any questions or comments for Kaiser or
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:17.000]  what's your take on the situation going on in your country
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:24.120]  and I'm just cruising around lots of police heavy police presence definitely
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.560]  looks like it's going into the police base other than that you know things have
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:35.040]  calmed down people of business as usual the sort of yesterday I must say you
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.560]  know there was a lot of that sort of hype around it in central London a lot of
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:45.080]  rumors flying around hysteria I guess you could call it so it has been a pretty
[02:26:45.080 --> 02:26:50.160]  couple of intense days you know people are worried and one of the most worrying
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:55.800]  things for me was today I was listening to the BBC London radio and they're
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:03.000]  talking about like what they had in in vigilantes you know they're going they're
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.880]  making a big sort of thing about this vigilante uprising that we're having up
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:12.840]  in infield and they're talking about our should the government empower people and
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:18.200]  give them powers of arrest and stuff I got I was like whoa you know this sounds
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:21.120]  like a sort of hitler youth brigade system that we're getting said into
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:26.320]  you know no one is above the law well here's the deal though under common law
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.400]  you have citizens arrest that's why the cops have arrest they're only organized
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:35.120]  under the citizens pleasure to do the work for us because we've got other
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:41.160]  things to do and but yes yes citizens were gays can turn into a Hitler Eugen
[02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:46.200]  or it can turn into a Sons of Liberty it depends but I mean if you've got
[02:27:46.200 --> 02:27:50.720]  citizens spying on people's speech which government has set up it's wrong but
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:53.880]  if you have citizens when they see somebody trying to set fire to a
[02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:58.880]  building beating them upside the head with a baseball bat or baton that is
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:03.760]  that is common sense of the difference is the government who are run by the
[02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:09.040]  banks is organizing people to basically be a spy grid they've already done this
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:12.840]  in England instead of the people should be getting together and marching on the
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.400]  city of London Max Kaiser here's a great way for people to get together and
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.560]  take down a major institution that is completely culpable in these riots they
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.680]  should pick a day in September let's say September 1st and organize a country-wide
[02:28:27.680 --> 02:28:33.280]  boycott and do not pay their BBC licensing take down the BBC for
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:37.600]  unconscionably setting up these riots by not reporting on the banker scandals
[02:28:37.600 --> 02:28:42.400]  for 10 years for having guys like Jeremy Paxman on every night throwing softballs
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.080]  to the banking establishment and by supporting the Bank of England and
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:51.280]  their atrocious confiscation of wealth pick a day to a country-wide don't pay
[02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:54.720]  your license fee to form a civil disobedience take down a major
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:58.840]  institution and then go from there and and folks if you don't understand how
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:02.720]  the banks are confiscating your wealth they're devaluing every major currency
[02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:06.760]  on earth they're devaluing every currency but the Swiss franc because they
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.120]  don't control it they are devaluing these they are cheating you they are
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:15.760]  robbing you and they're making a short-term profit anything else caller
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:22.280]  well yeah let me just let me follow up on that and just say that I have made
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:25.360]  that suggestion to people in prison before and they all come back to me and
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.240]  say yeah but it's against the law not to pay your license fee I'm saying yeah no
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:32.920]  kidding it's against the law to have your wealth stolen as to but unless you're
[02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:37.280]  willing to go to the front line and do something you know this is the easiest
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:39.920]  form of civil disobedience you could possibly that's I'm gonna have you
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:42.920]  expand on that for the break we'll get that one comment from Ian then we'll
[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:46.640]  look and then that's it for callers from angle we appreciate all of you calling
[02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:48.960]  but Ian will be able to finish up they don't want to get into some of the

[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:55.600]  else as well and don't forget to visit great sites like maxkaiser.com now we
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:59.320]  heard from folks in England they pretty much concur with my analysis the
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:06.400]  problem is as I said they're going to use this to demonize legitimate protest
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:10.480]  demonstrations and you do have a criminal illegitimate government in
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:14.960]  England and the US and so I've always said that I don't think it's a good idea
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:18.960]  to get violent at this point to keep trying to fix things peacefully but you
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:24.200]  can't really criticize people who do basically start resisting the government
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:30.080]  because it is illegitimate but they've craftily set up a control grid ahead
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:35.640]  of this takedown program so maxkaiser how do you counter that they've they've
[02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:40.720]  already set up the fake narratives that anybody resisting them is evil just like
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:46.120]  Hitler did and the general public doesn't understand what the megabanks are
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:51.200]  doing this global domination program so how do we educate them well I gave a
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:55.920]  great idea for a civil disobedience campaign mobilizing the masses to shut
[02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:59.760]  down the BBC by not paying the life of the state that would swing the balance
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.000]  of power back to the people suddenly the people have something that they can use
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.760]  as leverage against the major institution and let me just point out
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:11.240]  something here you know Alex a few months ago I introduced you to Nomi
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:16.040]  Prince a former Goldman Sachs partner excellent gas you've had her on her show
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:21.440]  a few times she's brilliant but I want to ask you also consider William K. Black
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:25.520]  or Bill Black I mean you may have had him on your show if you haven't had on
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.160]  your show he's the guy who put a thousand bankers in jail during the SNL crisis
[02:36:30.160 --> 02:36:35.680]  he's a brilliant speaker he's available you got to get him on your show he can
[02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:40.720]  explain these things no no no he's in fall the Republic he's in the same film
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:47.480]  that you're in Max no we need to get him back on the last
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:54.120]  time on my show and the guy is he put a thousand bankers in jail he he knows
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:59.560]  exactly what to do he knows who to call and what what he's the entire he has
[02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:04.120]  said that the theft we're seeing is an order of magnitude above any grand
[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.760]  larceny ever and he said it will lead to a total complete collapse a year and a
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:13.560]  half ago in fall of the Republic and so net and so for folks that are tuning in
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.200]  this is total depression total collapse looting and war in the streets
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:23.040]  welfare mobs going crazy unless we reverse what the bankers have done so
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:28.160]  so break down what they've done we're now at the precipice where we go from
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:34.040]  here if their program of global takeover is not reversed Max well you're
[02:37:34.040 --> 02:37:39.440]  asking me the kind of how how it happens I mean the bigger narrative in terms of
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:45.160]  the device use I mean I can tell you that in the absence of a true standard
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:50.480]  for your money like a gold standard if you go to an interest rate scheme to
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:55.080]  determine the value of your money you set up a dynamic where and we see this
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:01.120]  played out in the economy today two forces are at war with each other one
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.360]  the people who want interest rates to be high these are people who have working
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.720]  and saving and they want a good rate of return on their money and then there are
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:13.920]  people who want interest rates near zero because they want to be very cheap for
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:17.760]  them to borrow because they use the borrowed money to speculate and when
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:22.240]  they make a losing bet they get bailed out and they use it okay so that's the
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.760]  tension now what's happened over the past 10 or 15 years is that the people who
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:28.640]  have been borrowing and speculating and getting bailed out have used their
[02:38:28.640 --> 02:38:32.080]  profits to influence government to keep interest rates low and to
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:36.000]  deregulate markets to make it easier for them to borrow and speculate they now
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.320]  control 50 to 60% of the US economy depending on how you calculate the way
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:46.320]  various corporations use cash and derivatives to boost beef up their
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:51.480]  profits beef up their bottom line so they control the US economy and it's
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:56.800]  all around this lever of interest rates the the the only balance to return to
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:01.880]  the US economy will come if interest rates are higher and people start to get
[02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:05.920]  return on their savings and you start to get capital you don't have capitalism
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:08.480]  without capital you don't have capital without savings and you can't have
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:11.960]  savings without higher interest rates and that's as clear as the nose on your
[02:39:11.960 --> 02:39:17.600]  face but the lobbying interest of the Wall Street is so strong they are not
[02:39:17.600 --> 02:39:22.320]  allowing interest rates to rise above zero and that is a financial oppression
[02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:25.920]  is creating this financial apartheid because it's creating a permanent
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:30.600]  underclass of people who never escape poverty and degradation and joblessness
[02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:36.720]  because the economy itself only serves those who are in the business of
[02:39:36.720 --> 02:39:42.800]  speculating borrowing and getting bailed out and so going forward the the need
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.520]  for interest rates to be higher is paramount now you'll hear people say
[02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:50.120]  that well that'll crash the economy that'll crash real estate that'll crash
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:55.120]  things it will in the short term like it did in Iceland but you have the basis
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:00.880]  upon which to rebuild a new economy that has real jobs and not a financial
[02:40:00.880 --> 02:40:05.400]  casino economy that has fake jobs it's going to be painful but it only have
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:09.160]  that pain you have it for a short shorter period of time and you keep your
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:14.560]  sovereignty the problem with this system is that it's an easy ride for some and
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:21.120]  we all lose our sovereignty it certainly is won't the bankers destroy
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:25.880]  themselves in the end the banksters because no amount of police state is
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:30.600]  going to allow them to in the end get away with their plan because it destroys
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:35.240]  everything they're cutting cops pay all over the world they're laying police off
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:39.760]  they're laying bureaucrats off so they're even laying off many of their own
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:45.400]  enforcers that are needed to keep the people in line while they're right by
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:50.640]  the bankers so a certain point so at a certain point we're going to be sending
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:55.320]  military expeditionary forces out like Nazi hunters to bring these bankers
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:03.160]  back because because they have lost all the perception of risk when you have a
[02:41:03.160 --> 02:41:09.000]  group of people who never get penalized for any of their bad behavior they just
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.200]  keep getting rewarded for their bad behavior they lose all perspective on
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  risk we you say aren't they're going to just hurt themselves in the end yes they
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:21.280]  are but they themselves can't comprehend it because they never make a
[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:25.920]  mistake they believe was black flight that is the goal of sex they're doing
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:28.920]  God's work they really have a God complex and that they believe that
[02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:33.320]  everything they touch turns to gold and in some cases literally now of course
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:36.640]  they're buying gold like crazy anything the price hitting new all-time high but
[02:41:36.640 --> 02:41:40.760]  when you don't have a society that penalizes bad behavior you have this
[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:45.400]  warped sense of risk and these people are kamikaze stewestide bankers as I
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:49.240]  call them because they have no conception of the risks they're taking for
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:55.080]  themselves because there's nothing in society to penalize them for their risky
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:42:04.760]  behavior well well said max so what's the time frame here if this program is
[02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:09.400]  not reversed if they explain to a new listener out there why is it bad that
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:12.120]  they've announced that for another two-plus years they're going to keep
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:17.400]  interest rates at zero why did that cause the dollar to accelerate its drop
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:22.200]  why did that push not just gold and silver up but other commodities like
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:28.200]  crude oil sugar explain to people how the interest rates being kept at zero and
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:32.400]  how the free monies being given to the central banks and no one else in a
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:36.640]  skewed system where the zero percent interest rates only for them explain to
[02:42:36.640 --> 02:42:41.920]  people how that's creating hyperinflation well that's exactly what I just you know
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:49.040]  went went over in other words when you have the criminals the borrowers the
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:53.360]  speculators when they account for a 50 or 60 percent of the economy you need to
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:57.760]  wash them out you need to get rid of them and the way that it this is done is by
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:01.600]  raising interest rates it's a classical notion of the job of the Fed reserve
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.080]  chairman is when the party gets too wild they take away the punch bowl and they
[02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:11.680]  do this by raising interest rates Paul Volcker did this in the 70s he took
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:18.400]  interest rates up to 16 percent 17 percent it caused a massive recession for
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.320]  two or three years but it laid the groundwork for the boom of the 80s 90s
[02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:27.440]  and 2000 and this is what's needed periodically to wash out the the
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:32.240]  speculators and the deadwood in a non-performing agent like these banks
[02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:36.360]  on Wall Street but the Fed obviously instead of raising rates as they should
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:41.680]  to get rid of the bad apples of the deadwood they're lowering interest rates
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:45.000]  they're encouraging the speculation they're encouraging the bad behavior
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:49.800]  why because they enjoy the free money that they're getting they've been
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.280]  co-opted by Wall Street and Obama's administration is offering no push back
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:59.480]  against this Tim Geithner is Obama's man on Wall Street and he's telling Obama
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.320]  lies every single day Obama is essentially financially illiterate he
[02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:06.800]  doesn't know the difference between a stock and a blonde he relies totally on
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.480]  Geithner who's in the pocket of Wall Street and he's engineering this zero
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:16.560]  percent interest rate policy for Zerp as it's called because it benefits the same
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:21.600]  few guys over and over and over again and the economy is being gutted exactly
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:25.120]  they're the only ones that get the zero or negative interest rate and then loan
[02:44:25.120 --> 02:44:30.040]  it to people out there for 30% or higher max seven o'clock tonight prison

[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:39.200]  course we're more than happy that it leaks out to the entire internet and we
[02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:44.200]  will post large portions of it at the YouTube channel but that can't be
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:46.960]  completely counted on because more and more they're shutting our channels down
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.840]  I've had to file in federal court against YouTube when they claim I violate
[02:46:50.840 --> 02:46:55.280]  their their their terms of use to prove that I haven't just to have that one
[02:46:55.280 --> 02:46:59.360]  channel we've put some backup channels out there but they can't be completely
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.640]  counted on so so yes you do get a lot of it our mission is to get the word out
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:07.640]  at the end of the day but we also need financial support and that's why I want
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:11.120]  to encourage folks to notice we've upgraded prison planet TV and it's eight
[02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:15.280]  years we're adding more and more the live audio streams the higher quality
[02:47:15.280 --> 02:47:19.960]  podcast audio the live video podcast of this show archived every day also
[02:47:19.960 --> 02:47:25.240]  streamed live my book Paul Watson's book many other films all my films expanded
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:33.040]  extras the new live streamed nightly reports special reports the new news
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:36.040]  show that's gonna be highly produced compared to anything else we've ever
[02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:39.280]  done and focused and I'm gonna be disciplined I'm better when I'm
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.080]  disciplined for 30 minutes every night 7 p.m. it's all coming to prison planet
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:49.680]  TV prison planet TV because things always get attacked and shut down we it's
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:54.640]  still gonna be there but we're gonna have a more cut and dry starting from the
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:48:00.400]  bottom new technological easier to use system in the next six months or so in
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.280]  prison planet TV is great but you're still gonna have that but if you're a
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:08.720]  member of that you'll also automatically be a member of the new news site that
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:11.960]  we're setting up and if you believe in this information if you believe in the
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:15.760]  fight we're putting forward here if you believe in us identifying the real
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:21.680]  global enemy not the puppet Obama or Bush or all this other garbage or liquor
[02:48:21.680 --> 02:48:25.800]  stores the drunks are thieving the globalists are gonna turn the welfare
[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:30.200]  hordes loose to attack the general public then the government's gonna come
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:33.640]  in to protect you from the welfare hordes that's where I disagree with
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:38.760]  Max Kaiser he's saying well overall this is just a symptom of the rot and I
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:45.840]  agree with him but we're in trouble so again I want to encourage everybody out
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.920]  to become a prison planet dot TV member today now go into Ted Anderson for the
[02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:54.640]  balance of this segment and the next getting into gold news and obviously I'm
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:48:59.240]  here pitching gold at you the prices of gold and silver Ted has are always
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.680]  extremely competitive the radio specials are lost leaders he either makes a tiny
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:08.960]  profit or no profit and if you miscalculate a negative profit now I
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:11.560]  told you three months ago when they artificially drove it down to buy gold
[02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:16.040]  and silver you know back when they drove down silver to 25 bucks an ounce and
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:20.040]  and you know gold by a couple hundred now gold is up I don't know what is it
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:25.840]  400 bucks in the last month silver is surged back up to 40 something you ain't
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:32.080]  seen nothing yet they've decided to devalue every major global currency except
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:35.000]  the Swiss franc because they're still sovereign because the globalists want one
[02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:40.120]  place to hide out from their own destruction now gold and silver only
[02:49:40.120 --> 02:49:43.800]  gonna go up now Ted talking to you this morning the gold you've got is from
[02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:48.640]  when it was at what 16 or 16 and a half a few weeks ago you're running out of
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:53.280]  that soon you'll be selling it from the 1800 and it'll seem cheap then but you've
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:57.280]  got gold you've got silver going to break I'll come back with the news on this
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.320]  tell folks the gold and silver offers you've got right now well again Alex I
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:04.800]  think it's just incredibly important that people pick up small pieces of gold
[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:11.280]  the Frank coin at $390 is a great buy I mean it's a small piece of gold it's
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:16.080]  recognizable it can be used anywhere as money British sovereigns are 489 by the
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:19.000]  way the Frank is a fifth of an ounce British sovereigns are quarter of an
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.760]  ounce even you know we I talked about $20 liberties here just the other day at
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:30.480]  2000 there are 2200 bucks gold spot today hit over $1800 I mean people you have
[02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:34.960]  need to wake up on this stuff I mean sober is starting to run with it and we
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:38.880]  should be picking up those silver dollars and those books and DVDs I mean I
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:44.040]  people really need to take you know heed I mean now's the time to get the

[02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:26.880]  that the Pentagon Homeland Security are watching US citizens on Facebook
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:32.520]  Twitter and the internet that talk about protesting the private Federal Reserve
[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:37.960]  that's what they're scared about they're scared of the Bank of England being
[02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:43.320]  protested they're scared of the private Federal Reserve being protested you know
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:47.720]  the footage is in the Obama deception but a few years ago it came out that the
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:55.760]  army went to Ron Paul's in the Fed event in Houston and our event in Dallas the
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:55:02.200]  army was there see the army isn't there when people are burning down your house
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:08.760]  the army's there at Katrina to come take your guns and the army's there to
[02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:12.000]  watch Ron Paul because the army doesn't work for us anymore it works for the
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:17.680]  foreign banks and so yes I know Gary French he led a protest against the big
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:22.160]  banks this other fellow we just saw the video from we are changed we're gonna
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:25.880]  get it up at info wars comm right now he announced that he was gonna have a
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:31.160]  demonstration or flash mob outside of New York Fed and 50 cops showed up
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:37.640]  nobody else joined him didn't matter it got attention start identifying and I
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:41.000]  guarantee you know these welfare people they want iPads folks they don't care
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.920]  about freedom this isn't a revolution this is a sign the welfare folks aren't
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:48.760]  getting as fat a check as they used to because they've been devalued going back
[02:55:48.760 --> 02:55:53.240]  to Ted Ted have you ever seen anything like this was with what's happening with
[02:55:53.240 --> 02:55:58.400]  gold right now way past its all-time high silver shooting back up right now
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:03.000]  no there's never been a market like this in my lifetime I'm sure there has been
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.560]  if you go back in history but never in my lifetime and I started when Jimmy
[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:12.080]  Carter was in office and we had double-digit inflation and when Max
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:15.520]  Kaiser was talking about raising the interest rates Jimmy Carter appointed
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.680]  Paul Volcker and I can tell you right now there has never been a market like
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:23.120]  this and there is no way that they could turn it around like they did then the
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:27.440]  United States no longer is a superpower and people are no longer using the
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:34.360]  United States currency abroad as a as a safe haven or a way to trade goods and
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:37.480]  services you know it used to be that other countries wouldn't trust each
[02:56:37.480 --> 02:56:41.160]  other so they go to the United States dollar why they did that because the
[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:46.640]  dollar was backed by gold during the Bretton Woods agreement and foreigners
[02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:50.400]  could trade it for gold they knew they could go back to gold well in 1971
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:55.880]  Nixon took us off that standard we've been living on this legacy of a gold
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:00.360]  traded currency and now it's gone the foreign countries don't trust the
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:04.440]  United States dollar anymore and now it's been downgraded our bonds and that's
[02:57:04.440 --> 02:57:08.360]  going to make it go even further yeah bottom line they decided to fully pull
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:14.040]  the plug on America and Western Europe to bankrupt us by design to set up their
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:18.480]  world government on its ashes all of Obama's controllers all the globalist
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:24.440]  have talked about this they're getting even wealthier in the process this is
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:30.120]  economic warfare our government is run by premeditating criminal scum and the
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:33.440]  bare minimum we can do is spread the word about it on AM and FM radio
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:39.400]  satellite shortwave spread the word about this show the system does not want
[02:57:39.400 --> 02:57:45.440]  people to hear this mainline talk radio is barely starting to get a clue which
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:50.080]  shows me that that's some good news a few years ago they had no clue we either
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:55.240]  get this information out or it's over well that's that's exactly why I'm
[02:57:55.240 --> 02:57:59.880]  offering three of your videos the Obama deception follow the Republican endgame
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:05.840]  for a total ship price of $130 because they're gonna get these videos new in
[02:58:05.840 --> 02:58:09.720]  hand I mean you can go tell somebody to try to find it on YouTube and it's
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:13.840]  worthless you didn't add the part about the three silver dollars and then I'm
[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:17.120]  sorry there are three silver dollars to go with it I guess I should put that in
[02:58:17.120 --> 02:58:20.720]  there because it tells you that now you're gonna have silver which is what
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:24.320]  you're gonna anyway yeah you pay cost on the silver dollars and get three of my
